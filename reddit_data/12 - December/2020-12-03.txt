House vote is pretty much a done deal. I doubt we see any major movement tomorrow if it passes. I would guess movement off of the vote tomorrow is only if it unanimous or it fails.

The Georgia run off to dem would tip senate control which means it might actually pass the Senate. I have long calls APHA, not sure what I'll do. Might take some profits pre vote. Let the dust settle and then go in again.

Interesting. Do you believe him?
Do you know what forex is?
U don't sound v old
The rig count is at all time lows though.. production has slowed down significantly and if demand just returns to normal 45 is not at all overvalued. Really it’s the only truly undervalued asset out there imo. Markets are at all time highs,  rates are at zero, manufacturing is beating services all around the world , the dollar is falling and oil is still barely above the cost of production.
This is the (autist) way!
Sounds like you’re trying to buy equity. Would include a link explaining why you should avoid going long but there are literally too many that I don’t know which to choose.

This should have received more attention. LMND to $175.

You have a point but I've seen way more ridiculous acquisitions ie Walmart buying Jets for 3B and trashing it within a year. Maybe some RE mogul will find value in their properties, entertainment industry exec comes up with a vision for them etc.
I'm not saying it's a sure thing but definitely a possibility

A dividend is bad for them while they are tryin g to turn this around. A dividend would make my calls look real cute but long term investors would not benefit. the company needs the cash for the turnaround and e-commerce emphasis.

It’s not that much money, take your investment out plus a lil profit then continue on with no regrets. When you get to your 30s 20k ain’t shit so really it’s all what you can handle physiologically
Business owners got a shit ton more than $1,200. Depending on the company this may have been passed on almost 100% to payroll, or placed entirely in the pockets of the owners. Both are almost certain to be forgiven as long there was at least some chance of disruption (how could you ever say there wasn’t?). This probably hasn’t been reflected on the income statements for any companies, however, since the IRS guidance is still murky. Look for a whole bunch of boosted guidances once that confirmation it’s income comes out. We still have room to run gents.
xpev too, was a lot more fun
Not just you, was about to ask the same question

Who is buying GME calls right now? A 16c (which is obviously already ITM) for next week needs to hit $18.07 to break even, like wtf
I've always wondered how much they actually cost to own. I heard their v8's are pretty good but that they do have electrical problems.
That’s good DD

Trick your brain by replacing a cig with something else when the urge hits.

Tell me how CRM will perform in the next 60 days. I brought at open and im having weak hands now

pltr is overhyped, overvalued trash. Easiest short of my life. down to 12$ we go. Imagine thinking an unprofitable company (THAT'S NEVER BEEN PROFITABLE IN ITS LIFE) for 17 YEARS is worth $100 rofl you people are RETARDED
The buyer has until 5pm (or 5:30pm on NASDAQ) to declare intention to exercise, which is why you always close your options instead of letting them expire if there is any significant after market risk.
Same. It makes responding soooo tedious

Bought at $11, sold most at $33. Holding freebies. There are better opportunities for large jumps with other stocks, imo. Maybe it will pop again when ticker changes, like GMHI to LAZR.

What if it’s trading below $10 when they call it quits?
Let's hypothetically say you instead released stuff like this around noon on the last day of a major options expiration (Dec 18) and simultaneously with some large firms.

Then, traders would blast the stock with 0dte puts and push the price down into oblivion.
her daughter going to expire worthless like the contract he bought
This place was so much more upbeat when NIO was mooning.  Tomorrow could be the day it all starts again 🥳🙏
Forex is down according to my brother.
same. too many regrets.
Next time u buy a pack, make a note of what day you bought it on. When you buy a pack after that make a note of how many days between packs. Every time you buy a pack from then on, add one day in between days you buy packs. It's easy to hold off on a smoke when u can tell urself "its just x more days until I can buy another pack". Keep doing this forever or until you no longer smoke.
Why Chevron?

3% rise in S&P for every 1% increase in exposure in equities from individual families. Estimated $1T demand per 1% rise, currently at 41% allocation with tech bubble ATH 47%. That gives us a roughly 18% upside from families alone if the mania continues. There’s still room to run on this bitch.

And when does this happen? Once it officially closes? Is there any benefit to selling now; I bought at 30 but am in no hurry to realize that profit. I like SF as a company so am happy to roll it over to that stock. Just wondering if that’s a truly stupid idea?

why comments are 15 mins ago. Site ded?
I was an expert at day trading and scalping. One day I almost hit 25k in 3 days (started with 4.5k) but I had positions in Boeing and Shopify and didn’t hit that 25k mark for unlimited day trades. So after I hit close to that 25k I had no choice but to hold my weekly positions (since I made more than 10 day trades that week). Next day after the weekend was over. Shopify dropped and my calls dropped 25% and panic sold my positions and dropped to $40 within 4 months. Fuck the 25k day trading rule 🖕🏼

What positions do you suggest if you are bullish?
If stock only reaches to $55, then no gain or loss (breakeven), if stock remains at $25, $100k loss (calls expire worthless).
I don't even think there was DD -- I don't how this popped up but wish the retards would stay out of it so I don't have to move it to my "meme stock" list and watch it swing back and forth.

Not exactly. 
A 50/50 bet would normally pay out 100%, or you lose 100%. 

In the options/stocks market a 50% loss inverses a 100% gain. 

50/50 shot for 100% / -50% is pretty fair
No idea to be honest. absolute crapshoot. Could go either way. My 16c expire tomorrow so I’m just playing the run up lol. Bought them today and went up 30% by close, but gambled on the hold into tomorrow.
Day trade stocks. I'm the same age as you and one big options play away. If i hit 25k$ and i can consistently day trade 3% (750$ a day ) I'm basically financially independent.
Still would be funny as fuck though

we really livin in monumental times eh?
Yeah I’ve been watching that right shoulder form for a couple weeks and it looks scary AF. I’m in for 400 shares in the low $20s, so hoping for good news.  

Regarding the warrants, my understanding is that the price had to be above $18 for a certain amount of time before they could get called, but they’ve already been called and people are already redeeming them, so the $18 thing is not a thing anymore. But I’m not 100% on that.

Smoke cock instead like a bear
If you believe that, sell 75% of it, and buy it back piecemeal over the next 2 weeks

So I should sell and take a small loss?
WEED
JETS calls are cheap, trying to play stimulus news. Reports are Pelosi and Schumer back a $900b bill with $20b for airlines, tied to NDAA which needs to pass by 12/11. Low risk, low reward short term play.

The biggest thing for me was everytime I went to sit in my sunroom, my muscle memory told me to have a smoke. Morning brew? have a smoke. Watchin a show, eh pop a smoke. Surprisingly, the cold nov weather has been helping me not go and smoke.
Wtf its late night and do i even have to ask what you are on
5$ a share? Fuck dude, just buy shares. Theres no point buying deep calls if they arent cheap
I feel like we moon hard if SPY breaks 375

I don’t know why, that’s just how I feel
So should I sell my NKLA puts? Is it done dropping?  I sold some at 17 but NKLA is back at 18.50 and my 1/15/21 $15p is bleeding.

When are we pumping trne
You do it in person when you can. If i want some thermal paste or some ram or whatever im going into the store to have it within the hour.

And yeah im not talking about current gamestop im talking about my fantasy store. It probably wont be exactly like that but i would definitely shop if it was close to that.
Animal cruelty isn’t acceptable you fuck. Staple your nutsack, don’t hurt an animal because you’re the retard.
This is actually believable, unlike stripe.
Oil is way overvalued it’s not about future demand it’s about current levels. Every country is flushed with oil to cover themselves for the next few years with full demand return. Production is coming back online already when our storage is still at capacity.

Yea man take the profit and run. Transfer all but 5% of earnings and play with that. First one’s free. Don’t fomo like most of us. Create a strategy on your next move and never buy on the news. Play on rumors and logical DD.
13k in 1/15 25c. Down 10%. Imma need him to be right uh soon ...
Impossible. It’s bullet proof
Also not sure if sentiment correlates with bullish or bearish tendencies that well. Particularly on this sub where many people are into options. "Pump and dump", "puts" would probably be in a positive context, "dip", "I am long on" will probably be in a negative context. "Sell" can be either way. I would probably rather redefine the task as a bearish/bullish classification of posts regarding a stock and try to bootstrap a training corpus but it's way too much work though I think you would find a positive correlation there.
You are retarded. They are right 100%
coupled with the enormous number of positive things moving forward with the company, earnings might be an insane catalyst for explosion, if it’s a dud im just going to keep loading
Ima buy Vroom shares tomorrow. At 52 wk low. They will be valued like Carvana soon
These PLTR memes make me feel a lot better about being down
mid year next year. Once you create enough momentum the passive etfs and indexes take over. They will have to commit more and more weighting to PLTR regardless of what happens because of liquidity and market cap.
Share code??
I came here to say, although I agree about Einstein, I just don't like the risk reward.  
$100k to maybe make $9400 if he gets the rocketship there by Dec 2021? Bet the same amount on any tech stonk for a similar long ball larry and you're almost guaranteed to 3-5x your money in the next year. This... if it gets there by June next year (which is only 7months away) would only double. I respect the gamble, I don't like the bet.
Imagine you had an initial $1000 or even 5k

What trash do you have your retirement in?
im talking 12 months +. TTD level explosion.
If I may ask, how did you get yourself to hold and not say F it, sell and switch to something else "that goes up" ?
No more like by summer
I think they may hold off until it gets close to the 12/18 option date.  Why stop the party now?  Im betting on the rug being pulled sometime between the 14th and 18th.  Im Holding on to some long and a couple of calls till then.

Wait why bot? Lots of accidents? I ziplined in Costa Rica 2 years ago.
I just got approved through fidelity for options and margin stuff (I don't even know what that is).  How many years have you been trading.... "10 years". Fdelity doesn't know that the account I opened with them in Feb is my first experience with stocks. How many trades per year....  Somewhere between 52 (one trade weekly) and 150 (about 3 trades weekly) seemed like a good response.  Again, fidelity doesn't know how many other accounts I have outside of their brokerage(0 to be exact).  How much is your net worth... 100k-500k.  It's not like they asked for w2's.   And so on.   Now all I have to do is figure out what to do for my first option gamble and ride the waves.   :). Yolo.
Really this is a 100k bet that pltr is above $55.20 by 1/2022. Should have done a 47c/-50c spread. At .30 with max gain 3.00, 100k is 1m if it is over 50 on 1/21/2022. To get a ten bagger like that on your options, you'd need pltr to go to 105.20.
Need CCL to jump nice tmr and BA to would be nice and Maybe ....just maybe ....TSLA ? :)
I chew nicotine gum. I haven't had a cig in like a year after smoking heavy for like 12 years. It's way cheaper, too.
Interesting thesis. I'd parked a bunch of cash into TLT as a hedge, but it seems from your thesis that the bond market could see significant volatility (not sure it will touch TLT, but they are all coupled at some level). Cash sucks as the dollar is being devalued, so what's your opinion on gold vs oil leaps? It can't go any lower....

Idk man my puts have been ripping lately
It’s gotta be a requirement for DD depending on the language of it to show your position with proof. I expect you to show proof like that asshole “professional.” trader PLTR thread with TA and confidence that your strikes are right. (He didn’t)  I don’t expect you to have positions if you’re just speculating a squeeze or somekind of news.
I just did some DD and their financials are solid. Just sucks that their avg volume is 192k
Haha then AMD short OTM calls if you wanna get weird. I’ve been a retard, it’s not worth it. Just doing what I’m doing now I make way way more money and I can sleep at night

✋ almost at break even. Did I buy the dip? No. F
I've been holding that since it was worth $16 and its been going up so far...
like regular stock but shinier
I’m just warning you guys, LAZR is up 163% w/ no earnings report and no mkt cap, there WILL be hit pieces knocking the price down. Don’t buy options or tell your family and friends about this yet
Rude ASSumption.

How you know Thiel isn't riding a 🚀?
Has any company ever done a share dilution like this and been purchased within 6 months? 

Without the stock price reflecting an equal decrease in price to the increase in shares.

Think of it this way, you go to a garage sale and find AMC with a 500 million dollar price tag, you can buy the whole company at the current price of 500. And the guy running the garage sale comes over and scratches off the price and says now to buy the whole company you have to buy 300 million shares instead of 137, making the new price north of a billion. And you ask him? What makes this company worth that much more, and you just shrugs his shoulders and slaps you in the face. 

Who on Earth would buy from that garage sale? Who would go back and face their board saying that they've just made a deal to buy AMC at twice to three times what they were worth a week ago?
Ohhhh I get it
Reddit starting to work very good for me!
🤡🤡🤡
Choo choo!
Cramer pumped it today
A lot more than that tbh
Don’t think the $51b from index funds will push the price up? I agree it will drop off after inclusion though.
1. Ryan Cohen owns 9.98% of shares. Tells board to get it the fuck together.
2. Short interest over 120%
3. Only 65.2m shares outstanding
4. Not going bankrupt. Paid some debt off early.
5. Stock priced getting memed pretty hard.
6. Possible huge catalysts: Sony or Nintendo partnerships, Ryan Cohen tender offer, guidance to Q4 earnings, your mom.

Hey many you are trying to argue with a cult.  This miraculous short squeeze is going to happen and they will all get rich.  Personally if I was a MM and you were willing to pay $18 for GME I would sell you as many shares as you could buy. I mean if you have the assets to basically never get margin called time is on your side.
I don’t ever send them heart emojis. Straight drool faces so they know I’m just a dog interested in eating their ass 🐶

Then if you think that way, going to work is also gambling. You could get in an accident.

Everything is "gambling". 

I don't like equating investing with gambling unless you're willing to accept every single action in life is gambling.

Otherwise, the mindset is useless and is not helpful. Again, if you haven't even read the literature then everything I'm saying to you is useless. 

If you haven't bothered to read Edward Thorpe, a man for all markets, then you don't have any background for what I'm saying.  It's important to have read a lot the background of the game you're playing.

The reason finance equates it to gambling is because of things like Edward Thorpe. Not because it is a complete "gamble" in which you don't know the outcomes. That's why gambling is popular in finance or any game in which probabilities can be derived.

I don't think Russia will sit idly by and see a US marine corps base being built less than 200km from their sovereign soil. Shit the whole reason Russia attacked Finland during wwii was because of adding more buffer land
I own 52000 pltr shares.  I’ve never bought an option in my life.  Sorry for idiot noob question but if I buy 60 contracts of 5/21 $50 calls like you did, what would they cost me today, and what would I make if stock is $50 by May?
ROCH!!!!
Lol it’s an oft used line of mine to girls who have really developed hourglass figures 😂😂😂

I mean the reason is that refineries are still facing demand issue for their products and there’s still bloated inventory. It’s much better than it was, but it’s still bloated. Crack spreads actually got worse with the most recent rally too which doesn’t help refiners

That said, with the OPEC cuts announced today and the vaccine news next week, I wouldn’t be surprised if crude hit 50 in like 1-2 weeks. Kemp had an article in Reuters a little while ago showing that a ton of shorts were closed out on /CL. Pretty dumb to be short with vaccine news coming up

Make game pass a digital/e-commodity

Big green dildo at open only to start trending down throughout the day tomorrow.  You heard it here first folks.
How long do you think it'll take to get to 100? There doesn't seem to be any significant bullish pressure coming any time soon for PLTR outside of us retards here.
I’m here so I know nothing. Question on selling puts: 

Hypothetically.. If you were to sell calls on idk let’s say GME, in the event that in the near future even with ER, you think it wont move much up or down, and collect the premiums when tards buy way OTM calls and they expire worthless. If it goes against you, and it actually moons and you’re forced into buying to close; would you really be mad? Because in theory if it’s increasing that much wouldn’t you have a decent chance of even making money from a continued uptrend from your OTM strike priced 100 shares? 

Same could be said for the inverse on a stock you believe will go back up long term for puts. Like you’d be buying them at a discount or dip and know it’ll recover eventually? 

Or am I just too high rn?
Remindme! 20 days
I don’t know about you but I’m gonna be loading up on $0.01 and $0.02 options every Thursday from here on out
Why buy hedge when just call do trick?
I started with 120k. Not rich rich lol. Just made some good yolos on shares.
Ehh it’s LIDAR, look what happened to VLDR post-SPAC
Surprisingly, the sell-off wasn't as drastic as it "should" have been. It's still found heavy support on 51-52 on two occasions now, still way higher than what it was at say a few weeks ago.
My God, that shitty dancing hottie in the front left.
4-5
It's not dumb if your reasoning is rock solid and you do turn a profit out of it. But that's the problem, the reasoning has to be SOLID.

In this case, betting against a company that's revamped its board, has net positive cash position after all liabilities have been taken care of and is heading into a very busy time because of new consoles being released... Well let's just say I wouldn't buy a put, and I've been retarded enough to be rekt by TSLA puts.

Everyone is talking about roblox IPO. If you don't think investors are pumped for this than your retarded. Sure it's a risky venture but also allows for massive gains. Grow some balls OP.
I hate retards that make this sub sound like stockwitts
is this your first python project?
!remindme 1 year
I feel that right now. But he’s not wrong necessarily, the current form doesn’t stop people from doing those things. 

If it mutates, as viruses are prone to do, and the death rate goes up and it starts killing a bunch of healthy people or causing some fucked up side effects (dick shoots off like South Park style) we could see people actually stay away from cruises/flights/etc. I’m not in air lines and cruise lines yet

Cramer pumped CIIG today.
why not just buy 200-500 shares. asymmetric risk return profile and you have six figures.. worth a small play
Does that work differently for shorts? If I place a limit order to sell my stocks below the bid, it fills for the bid price
Sounds like it will pull a Uber type IPO then, unless we get a ton of great news regarding travel.

Price too high is all, will pop to 59-60 stall out and slide back to 35.
It’s been pretty low volume lately so I’m thinking towards the downside
I'm now playing 1/15 because Theta.

Once it hits 97. I'll be out.
I like this
5000 shares avg cost $9, 30+ April calls. 

Let’s get this party going.
Next meme stock lool the hype on this sub alone will drive that bitch up at open, but I’d personally stick to shares cuz volatility might hurt u. That’s just my opinion, I’ve been holding “LAZR” since in was 12$ with GMHI.

Absolutely. Staying relevant as a company that is often equated to Blockbuster 2 is difficult. Even more so when the management has been very slow to adopt the digital marketplace. They have to make up a ton of organizational debt, and not the money kind. They need to rehab their image and fortify or establish revenue sources. The only real question left is whether or not they can convince the market that they can do that. Q4 will be their last real console earnings boom. It’s the last stop. If they fail guidance and Cohen/investors don’t step in to force the board’s hand, then it’s game over.
Multi? Sorry, but even I don't see how lol. Please do share your math!
I don't use options purely for hedging or as a hedge at all.

Like i said, you can create whatever you want with options. I mean, you are aware of put call parity so obviously you can make it behave like a stock if you want. 

So ya... If you can't use options to create synthetic positions then I don't know what to tell you. And if I told you any more I'd be helping for free, and I don't believe in giving any of that stuff away. Unless a person wants to tie themselves to me for life, then sure...

Even small amounts of research would show just how complex you can get with options so really it's up to you to go look for it, no one who has done that research will give it away for free, that's idiotic.
Its time to raise the price target on NIO and XPENG...If Tesla is a $600B company, they are at least a 100B.

High IV is self explanatory, IV is fucking retarded right now; boomer stocks like BA are up 60% in the last month and meme stonks like GME shoot 10% a day right now.

The other part is just probability saying that the pay in at x rate of $50 pays out so high right now and it’s statistically much more probable to hit than normal that it’s a much better idea than normal.

You truly belong here, no one is going to retrofit a movie theater into anything else. No one has ever retrofitted a movie theater into a warehouse or a grocery store or fulfillment center. It will never ever happen. 

Also coming no one will buy the entire company in order to purchase and use all of their retail locations. 

They're real estatesure is tied up as collateral for the six billion in loans they have, and it was worth something when people actually wanted to own a movie theater, now they pretty much all have to be torn out and new buildings put up in their location.

Yes there is value there, not nearly as much as they would have appraised for before 2020, and so therefore not enough to offset their debt.

I thought a company like Warner Bros or Disney or universal would want to buy AMC, but I think there are antitrust rules about movie studios owning too many theaters, and even if those can be overcome, they have their own pandemic headaches to deal with, no one wants to take over someone else's pandemic headache.

If yoy net new arr growth % continues to rise during this period, you’re golden.  I believe this implies that it will be 70%+ growth rate by then at least.  As soon as a single quarter happens when arr growth rate (% of % growth) is flat or down, the 45x multiple reverts to market which is more like 18x.  You’re betting that the total arr at that time is at least 3-5x where it is today.  With your time horizon you have exposure to a lot of competitors and also an acquisition at any price below $90B.

I would go as far as to suggest that there may be a possibility in which there's a slight chance such that one could believe the probability of an existence towards a belief of GME hitting 19 tomorrow.
Thanks!
Obama smokes. Are you saying you think you're better than Obama
Those really should not be called LEAPs, but on WSB they are for sure lol
Started options about a week ago. The way I see it is the shits volatile. I have 6 different calls had a few weeklies. Main thing I realized is fuck weeklies lol that shots gambling. When you do longer time til expiry options I consider it like you are purchasing shares of a company. It’s better if you do it a few years out to garuntee your price could strike however you pay a higher premium for this.

First day I was trading options I was up like 4 k that same day. 

Now I am down like -8k on those same positions, however when I was in the green with my contracts for LSPD I sold 1 the next day I sold 4 and then today I held and sold the remaining 5.  My initial sell of the one was a loss. The second day was my initial investment in profit. And then the last day was an extra additional investment from the remaining profit. 

So from a 3k option I made like 3k. 

That is pretty good to double your money like that. It was expiring on the 18th so i figured might as well take the gains. 

I have a bad case of being scared to sell my shares since I have been value investing for some time 

Some tips that resonate with me:

An exit price is hard to determine but it helps 

The exit price should be determined on how much percentage profit you want or potential loss you can take. 

You must be able to handle EXTREME volatility. 

You can be up 2k then down 10k in minutes. It is what it is, that’s the market. 

Whatever option you pick, you gotta research it. 

Look into options more. 

Don’t listen to any random on Reddit without doing your own DD if they talking out there ass or if they are giving sound advice. 

Always trust your gut.

I believe you're correct. Look, anything can happen. Am I genuinely expecting 1 million. No. But I do think these will be worth 3x the price I paid for when I cash out. Unless of course this goes parabolic like NIO which will prob hit $100 q1 2021

The lack of financial education in this country is super depressing. I got "lucky" in that I studied econ and basically stumbled into an advanced financial derivatives class during undergrad, which gave me a crash course in finance and then taught options theory, Black Scholes Merton, etc.

Now I'm in my mid 20s and while I still make plenty of retarded moves with my portfolios, I feel so so so bad for my older coworkers and friends who often outright avoid the market because they don't understand it.

I'd like GME to hit 20 tomorrow.
Like I said, wrong REEs. The metals mined in MP are really, really rare, as in they have a minimal influence on our economy due to limited availability period, and thus limited upside. MP is labeled as too necessary for national security to fail, because the few things these metals are used for cannot be replaced or supplemented with anything else. Doesn't matter if they make $100b in a year, or $1 a year - the Feds want them open and will subsidize them if necessary. 

So you know, we import less than $200 million in REEs a year: https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trade-china-rareearth-explainer-idUSKCN1TS3AQ This is a tiny market. Focus on battery metals or different REEs.

In terms of getting monster returns on your investments, you need something that there is an increasing and large demand for - like any metal used to make high density batteries, solid state batteries, and super conductors. These metals, as I have said now for the third time are: lithium, cobalt, nickle, and graphene (this one is carbon). Seriously, get this through your head, autist - Li, Co, Ni, and C in the form of graphene. Look up A$BML and W$WR, without the $, and you will see what I'm talking about. Look up means go to their websites, not yahoo finance.

Co, Li, Ni, and graphene aren’t as rare and as aren’t strategically important because Chyna doesn’t control global supply of them.  We can get that stuff from other countries.  The REEs mined at MP are niche but they’re essential for a lot of new tech. RE magnets are everywhere now
Shhhhh dont use logic when it comes to GME
I don’t do either, girls hear “you’re beautiful” or get heart eyes emojis 500 times a day from different dudes so they filter it out
Optimal time to close credit spreads is around 21 dte. I usually close if I collect 50% profit or roll out if I think my assumptions will still hold. At that point you’ve collected a fair portion of the steepest zone of the theta graph. No reason to have a winner turn into a loss if it randomly goes south before expiration. I have a similar 260/250 spread and collected about a third of the width.

Energy is really interesting ... it seems to me during the year institutions were shorting the stocks because they had exposure via bonds , but now high yield ‘corporate bonds in general are way over value so maybe they are selling the bonds and covering their shorts? If the stocks are no longer under selling pressure the less likely they are to sell oil futures so it sets up a massive rally if demand is there.. I think dEmand will be strong now that the vaccine news is out there and foreign export driven markets are kicking ass. No reason for oil to be below 50 if the recent move in foreign stocks is legit , which I think it is.
Lol it’s too true
BUY BUY BUY!!!!!!
Preach
Ahh shit. I got out too early
1) This is awesome. Congrats

2) Metals & Materials are hot and getting hotter.  They're a recovery play.  Also, the dollar is falling and inflation showing signs of starting up, which makes the metals part more valuable (as well as the value of any foreign sales bring more dollars home).  Good sector to have stumbled into at the right time, and a decent blue chip name to have done so with.  (My play here is Newmont Mining (NEM), gold focused, with Dec & Jan calls and shares.)

3) Long term a good stock, but it's bumping up against its YTD high.  Likely to see some resistance that could have theta eat some of your gains if you try to hold until the new year.

4) You've basically just "found" $5,000.   You need to decide which you hate more: Paying the tax man, or not making any money.   If you don't want to gamble on it for at least 4 more weeks, take your official victory lap and pay the government their take.

Good accidental work.

Seriously, everything outside wsb feels lack luster now.  My Reddit app=wsb app
FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK
I think one reason they've tried to give for it is that the market shoulda gone higher if not for virus
Delusional
So you’re dad who made a suuuper successful move in the past ( but held too long?) is saying buy Tesla and you don’t trust him??
Hahaha this would be very amusing. I think more likely is that most of the float sells shares between current levels and say $35/share. I think it goes higher from there but leaving the short squeeze aside, the business still has some serious work to do even if they have avoided winding the business down.

Like, their cash flow can reduce or eliminate debt and buyback shares, but they need to turn around the revenues and net income. They appear to be in the middle of a transition from physical to online presence....and so on....

So, yes I think the short squeeze is real, but I also believe GME has some serious work to do (which is why the shorts exist in the first place)
To jive with the boys around here you need a min of 75% risk tolerance. This isn’t the place to get advice king
Haha this was funny, i hope you didn’t copy it. Cuz that would make you a copy cat.
Yeah just another reason to own puts :D
Your just naming companies that sell the same shit is it that fucking hard

it was 27 a week ago. merger hasn't even gone thru yet so think there's plenty of time to hit a new ath. 

also if you feel ciig is already too high look into gme. its gonna be the short squeeze of the century and all you have to do is hold your stocks till dec 8.
Still can't believe how much money I made on ZOOM (not ZM)
I dont even have any gains. Btw when should I do that?
I was going to say...wtf are you smoking, and then remembered TSLA split 1 to 5....

F.
Average Tuesday
10% green day on GME tomorrow? Looked good at close and after hours. Shirts May scramble to cover under $17 before the weekend. My 16c FDs would love it
OTM weeklies asap!
Worked with ZOOM booming after ZM went up.
Because people take profits before weekend+SPY hit ATH+Pfizer news+Job report coming out tomorrow
So yeah, you're mostly right, but all my money is invested.  So I sold puts against Tesla and landed a few more thousand this week.  I would just wheel it if I had lost.  I do things like that when all my money is busy and I want to use my leverage for some wins.
Similar here as well

If you wanna some easy money you can bet on GOL/AZUL comming back to at least half of what they were precovid. I got really cheap early november calls for january/april 2021 and im like 800% up already, theres so much room still to grow
It beats killing yourself
I don’t think they’re saying it’s fake news. I think they’re just trying to say they can still meet their 2020 targets even if they have to reproduce those same doses again.

But timing is literally everything, so saying "I was right but had bad timing" is nonsensical.

Lmao why do you say that 🤡
First one is always free lol
Good point, should have specified discount brokerages. All those who went commission free. No such thing as a free lunch!
As much as I like your trade, i think you should make it multi legged so you get more convexity. You won't be able to capture a lot of the upside in the initial legs of the move. Sometimes in managing risk, its better to run with front-end convexity so that you can de-risk with the same amount of delta.

A simple example is so, if PLTR runs to 40 before going to 100 by the end of 2020. You would make 10x using your Long dated OTM.  You can replicate similar return profile by making 5x when it gets to 40 and then take half of your capital which can return another 4x if it gets to 100 while keeping half of your capital in cash. The multi-legged structure puts only half of the total capital at risk for the second leg.
lol i thought jp morgan said that the us stock market has another 20% upside. I almost died from laughter 🤣

S&P 500 is the last layer of the pyramid scheme. You can’t spread it any wider or lower than that.
People who say "bear r fuk" when futures are green are really underestimating the cockroach-like souls of the common American bear. Every day there is a bearish play, and we find it. 


You think we survive by going bankrupt every time indexes are green? We are the parasitic bottom-feeders of the economy, surviving by suckling on the asshole of the equities market.
It’s been like that for like a month straight bro.

When posting DD, always wait for a green day. Have it saved as a word document and just wait. If the stock goes up >10%, THEN post at the end of the day. 

This seems like what everyone does. Smart actually. If you do this, you won't get perma banned.
I got IV crushed by CRM this week trying to make up my loss on that play lol u would think with them buying slack that the stock would go up but we r just sheep in this game and New York rules everything

Imagine buying GME “for the long run.”
630c 12/11 660 12/18 let's goo
When you’re trying not to nut just think of Criton
I've seen posts a while back for GME squeeze and it still hasn't happened yet.  With earnings coming up and GME posting a loss, wouldn't the shares go down further?
Better be soon playboi
Speculative interest just for S&P inclusion has massively overshot the price, so I think it snaps back. Even S&P inclusion doesn’t translate to that much incremental demand for shares. So I think it rolls off either before or soon after inclusion.
Thoughts on if MARA can run up to $45+ like the last bit pop a few years ago

yes, we could in theory start an interesting activist fund where we actually use reddit to vote on corporate strategy decision and rely on the wsb hive mind. would be a very fascinating experience

Are you trying to get the bird flu and crash the market?
You’ve been up and down for this past year.
I'm unsure of the conversion rate of tendies to USD but since you are committed let me give you some more thoughts...at the least I hope to inspire WSB to turn into hostile takeover forum...they sell a product that converts electrical signals to chemical signals to reduce pain and offer an alternative to opioids. This (imho) has the potential in the future (once the opioid lobbyists are reduced) and replace drugs. Then think of when you can go to a club and instead of taking drugs to alter the chemical composition of your brain to make you feel high they stick electrodes on you to change the electrical frequency of your brain (then take them off when your ready to drive home). This has way bigger implications, it can alter how you sleep and possibly replace caffeine. Their patents have potential, but their corporate sucks money out of the company. They have enough sales to make decent money (c-suite gets paid 900k/year, start paying them nothing) and patents on the goods become valuable in 10 years once others develop the technology further its a patent war for money
Hope it works out for you! I’m too much of a wuss to play HYLN any more
Idk why you're being downvoted. You're not wrong. And all signs point to a lower consolidation period. Which would actually be pretty good and healthy for us, no? These parabolic moves aren't fun lol
Waste of time and money. Do you know how many shares you have to buy to make a real return? Most of these are where they are because they are run by an actual idiot with a used 5 series BMW from 1994 and have been reversed split so many times even gay bears are afraid of their bottoms.

Right now they're right around their long term p/e and their eps is expected to stay flat or drop a little next year.  I don't see any good reason to buy.
That’s why we need another paper trade competition. We get so many rehashed jokes and memes the comments just aren’t funny.

They have just two devices that they are making for autonomous driving (comma ai has better stuffs than Luminar for that matter). LAZR is all hype

Biden can just write an executive order. This is all for show. It doesn’t matter what the turtle will or won’t do. He isn’t needed here. This is to show their base that they listened and voted on a bill.

Good until Biden gets in and shuts everything down, make sure to sell before then.
You’re absolutely right. The point is still the same. It’s a company that has existing for decades, has decades of financials, and is not a speculative company yet it still has a valuation 10x its revenue. I don’t think it’s odd for palantir to have a 40b valuation as a speculative company.
[deleted]
So since the Pfizer "supply issue" news was #fakenews, we expecting it to moon tomorrow?
thats not what im saying lol but the company just IPOd they need to prove themselves more they would need 10-15 yrs (being generous) to reach $40B revenue so thats 10-15 years of growth already priced in if you think about it. i get you wanna be funny but dont just jump to conclusions.
You know you get 3 "free" day trades per week regardless of how much money you have right? And if you're too poor to day trade you're too poor to be buying 1 DTE SPY options my guy

You didn't convince me, you are a winner. And I'm not being autistic or retarder.Retards only buy 1 or to months out. Calls are too expensive 1 year out the way to go. PLTR is a $1,000 stock. You have to be retarded not to see where are they heading.
Hbd.
Yes, which is why it’s trading at nearly 200% of its pre-COVID value.
bro covid is like the flu. it's not cured. its like getting the flu shot.. u may still get it. this is why MRNA gonna be the real mvp. imagine you have to get a covid shot every year? the entire fucking planet.

You're right they were losing contracts. But since then Constellis Holdings LLC has acquired more private military contractors to offset this issue. I believe that they are trying to eliminate any competition they might have.

Ah I gotcha, yea I don’t need anything like that for sure.
So they just said they were redeeming their warrants on the 30th which is the cause for the massive drop the last several days . However, I feel this is a good recovery point, someone drop some knowledge of you got any. It honestly looks like it’s forming another smaller head and shoulders. If someone can explain this better it seems that because of their redemption period they have to maintain a share price above $18 or forfeit being able to redeem their warrants at a price of $.01. Would that not mean we’re about to see a reversal to ensure they stay above that price?
Jd and baba mooning in hk🚀
The lockup period ending will put more shares into the public market. While I don't think these shares are being created it will feel like dilution, because they are available to the public.
Don’t ever look at share price. Outstanding shares determines this number.

Why wouldn't you have sold at the bottom today?
When
When I quit social media, I didn't lose anything because nobody posted on my wall, nobody tagged me, nobody cared about me. Social media isn't meant for indian men to begin with due to the steriotypes. So I actually lost nothing by quitting social media. It's like social suicide, but there was nothing "suicided" to begin with. 

What did you lose?

Yea classic dick pattern so your basically fucked. I hunt bears for fun and even I would consider it time to put if I relied on my TA voodoo shit

Nikola has nothing that would allow them to flourish. Their semi truck has zero patented technology. There’s literally nothing that would make their truck better than the competition. What’s stopping Volvo or Mack from reaching the same agreement with GM? 

Even if it doesn’t go bankrupt, I’m willing to bet $5,000 dollars right know that in 12 months HYLN will have a larger market cap because they have an actual product. 

I would say you’re a retard for being bullish in NKLA but you know that already.

They were buried deep in the OTCmarkets market activity. But now realizing that this site doesn't allow penny stocks, I'm afraid it might not be up for too long. Best bet would be to save the list if you are curious. I try to deal with low volume stocks before they are discovered.
I’ll put his whole head in my mouth raw, salmonella style.
My money isn’t tied up, I sold them against margin. Only keeping $2000 as margin excess in the account.
Wait for a second bounce off 20k in shitcoin to settle at like 17k or something and then buy options off the dip in riot. Easy huge upside once Bitcoin actually pushes through which will probably be once stimulus passes on boomers start FOMOing cause they’re scared of a second crash and worrying about inflation
I'll come back to this smart talk when I'm a millionare and can afford education.
Apparently the top of the bull market usually comes when everybody turns bullish. I think we still have a little bit further to go but the markets are going to turn down soon.

They have contracts will all rare earth mines in the US. Literally all of them. As well as with Canadian and  European companies. Lots more growth to be seen from the mines who produce metals that our economy and "green energy revolution" count on. Look for Lithium, nickle, cobalt, and graphene mines.

Lol. Futes green, previously cocky TSLA short seller was crying on Bloomberg today about his extremely "painful 2020", Najarran just upgraded his price target to 780, Cathie Woods is no longer selling any of ARK's shares until the next run up, and Elon said they will not be diluting shares anytime soon. 

This is just silly.
There's nothing better than buying right before a big green dildo candle. There's no enjoyment in selling unless you sell right at the top to the penny, and even then you're sad that it didn't go higher so you could have made even more money.

I got 12/31 but it’s ITM.  AAPL likes to sell off after an event.  Plus it’s the elephant in the room (SPX).  If it pumps take the profit....u can always pick it up later on a red day.
agreed 100% on the brand recog. went to google trends and compared gme with newegg and microcenter. imagine gme having the product assortment of those two online and being able to pick it up in store. buy a collectible while you are in line. if anyone can make this happen its mr chewy. i wasnt in until i saw his letter. once i saw it iknew he was in it to make it a 20 bagger.

It's possible it will 30 EOM, but probably 25 over next week or so, then consolidate for a week or two before running up to 30.  It doesn't have big institution attention yet BUT when it gets it, IT WILL RUN just like XPEV did and PLTR did when funds took notice.  It's a $2 billion dollar market cap company trading nowhere near the multiples it should.  Analysts will notice and quickly run this thing to $40 before you can finish jerking off and put your pants back on.
it depends have you achieved your goals yet?

Don't miss your chance and get into BABA. Forming a bullish penant and has a gap above it has to fill. This of course will be a multi-day swing
Reasoning differed. This time because I liked the break even price it was giving me. Also implied volatility was extremely high when I sold them 97%. When IV goes down, which it did to 92% which is why the contract is still trading where I sold it at, it’ll lower the price of the contract as well.

Baba calls at open tmrw
Yea
Can’t. Not happening.
They may have been doing that in prep for Q4 (console boost,) but it appears shorts haven’t been covering for Q3. The short interest isn’t decreasing, it’s fucking increasing lol.

I do wonder though, how do they dodge this if it is coming? If they start buying, they risk starting the squeeze early themselves. Also, GME has enough capital to complete sizable share buybacks, so there’s that wildcard. I’m just hoping Q3 earnings call is like the never ending handkerchief magic trick, and they just keep pulling out all of the positive what-ifs the community has thought of. It all concludes with Sherman announcing retirement and Cohen as the interim CEO (if that’s even legal or possible.) Everyone nuts, GME skyrockets to BRK.A levels per share, multiple large financial institutions with big short positions crash trying to cover, the S&P skyrockets because TSLA announces partnership with GME to go into effect in Q4, and PLTR will be contracted to handle the data generated for both companies. The US economy collapses, NIO skyrockets for no reason, and WSB holds their GME calls to expiry which just happens to be right when everything levels out and GME is delisted for economic war crimes. The daily discussion board lights up with “WTF GME, WRONG WAY!” and “GME will moon again!!! 🚀🚀🚀”
Lol

Costa Rica signed for covid vaccine with PFE!!!🥲🥲

I fucking hope so my man.  Its really about time...nothing has fundamentally changed about the company.  They have 3 years to comply and the company is already saying they have made the changes to comply. Market is nonsensical and there will be a reckoning.
Just do SPY 380 12/31. After that prints, hold and wait for the market to crash on loan deferments and credit market implosion. Then get puts, and enjoy making a fuckton
Going to be honest, I’ve never seen one of those tickers in my life.

You’re correct. I’ll edit that. To add, in 1995 they had a market cap of 50 billion and a revenue of 2 billion. Those might be a little off as well but the point is the same.

while their vaccine is going to come in very handy for the 1st round, I don't think they  are the one...it's MRNA, AZ, or JNJ . Also their market cap is gigantic so this vaccine is just a small part of their overall bottom line

My thought is buy calls expiring in a few days or a few months, never in between. And sell them at least a day before expiration and a month before expiration, respectively.
Rocket ships are the future.
PIC. They’re such an intriguing EV power train company (XL Fleet who they are merging with) and I’ve gone the most all in I’ve ever gone after doing DD last week. I’m in at 1/15 15c and a measly 200 shares but that’s a dec amount of my port
Sheet, I would have jumped on this had I known.
Can I avoid that if I roll the profits into a different position? Maybe withdraw 2k as a reward? Would I pay taxes on the 2k or the full 10k profit which 90% was reinvested.. yes I’m that new lol
Yea, and it’s always worth more than what they stingy analysts trying to manipulate the market say. If they are saying 60 that means the floor needs to be 70

What happens to a LEAP option if let’s say current price is $50 and you buy the $75c 2 years from now... then a week later news comes out and they get acquired for $60 a share?
US weed stocks. They are referred to as MSOs. Multi state operators. 

Unlike the Canadian meme stocks they actually are cash flow positive and are growing +100% annually. 

Even if multiples don’t expand or even if they contract sales and operating profit will continue to grow and valuations will continue to rise. 

They also are currently traded otc and not on the big exchanges so when regulation change and they can trade on a real market (NYSE or Nasdaq) there will be a huge influx of institutional money that cannot invest in OTC securities. Oh... and huge meme potential because you can’t buy them in RH yet either.

Anyone pay attention to the yield curve? Seems like it steepened a lot in November and that led to the rally in value... basically if the ten year rate goes up buy energy/materials . If it is falling buy a high flying tech stock ... seems to be the formula. Personally I hope value remains in because it’s so much easier to buy a value stock than a momentum stock .
Personally waiting for it to dip, but do what you feel. Since it’s a recent ipo and WSB is catching on I URGE you to not play options and stick with shares since volatility will be high

Depending on how expensive you're willing to go I bet Disney pushes 200 by mid/late spring.

For stocks I've been kinda tracking for a while but didn't make my moves at the right time -- look at X and AA. Steel and aluminum, prices down going into 2020 already and COVID was a wet blanket on those metals. Recently seeing a surge. I think AA and X are above 30 and 20 respectively by Spring if not by end of year the way they're trending. They're still catching up on stock price recovery many others have seen from pre-COVID and they're getting boosted from higher metal prices that were weighing them down going into 2020.

Look at their 5 year charts and you'll see similar patterns with peaks in early 2018 they're nowhere near.

the owners of the company hold millions and millions of shares they can and will sell to the public. Definitely not correct.
everyone is predicting that. guaranteed MM's not gonna make it easy. When MM's know something great is coming they shake off the paper hands.
So declining YoY is already priced in, right? 🥴🥴

Can't go wrong with Apple or Amazon, any of the FAANG shit really.
Wrong REEs there bud for EVs. You are looking for cobalt, lithium, nickle, and graphene which aren't mined at MP. There are a bunch of  pennies you can invest in if this is your thing (W$WR, A$BML - fuck you mods, I'll mention pennies if I want). Also, Chyna has a 10% stake in the mountain pass mine (Shenghe Resources Holding Co. Ltd).

There is a reason this mine was bankrupt in 2017... Lots of really rare elements in low abundance that dont have a significant role in our economic foundation, but are none the less valuable in their own right. Tough way to make money.

Edit: extra tid bits about MP from wiki that you might find interesting (Chyna use to do all the processing of the ore from MP and sell it back to the US):

Since 2007, China has restricted exports of REEs (rare earth  elements) and imposed export tariffs, both to conserve resources and to  give preference to Chinese manufacturers.[\[16\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Pass_mine#cite_note-16)  In 2009, China supplied more than 96% of the world's REEs. Some outside  China are concerned that because rare earths are essential to some  high-tech, renewable-energy, and defense-related technologies, the world  should not be so reliant on a single supplier country.[\[17\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Pass_mine#cite_note-17)[\[18\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Pass_mine#cite_note-18)

On September 22, 2010, China quietly enacted a ban on exports of  rare earths to Japan, a move suspected to be in retaliation for the  Japanese arrest of a Chinese trawler captain in a territorial dispute.  Because Japan and China are the only current sources for rare-earth  magnetic material used in the US, a permanent disruption of Chinese  rare-earth supply to Japan would leave China as the sole source. Jeff  Green, a rare-earth lobbyist, said, "We are going to be 100 percent  reliant on the Chinese to make the components for the defense supply  chain."[\[19\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Pass_mine#cite_note-19) The [House Committee on Science and Technology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_Committee_on_Science_and_Technology)  scheduled on September 23, 2010, the review of a detailed bill to  subsidize the revival of the American rare-earths industry, including  the reopening of the Mountain Pass mine.[\[20\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Pass_mine#cite_note-20)

After China doubled import duties on rare earth concentrates to 25% as a result of the [US-China trade war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China%E2%80%93United_States_trade_war), MP Materials said, in May 2019, it will start its own processing operation in the United States by 2020.[\[21\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Pass_mine#cite_note-MP_SCMP-21) According to Bloomberg, "China Has a Rare Earths Plan Ready to Go if Trade War Deepens".[\[22\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mountain_Pass_mine#cite_note-22)

Then that’s where I come in, you’ll be eating each other alive with doubt while I quietly scoop up shares...you’ll move onto the next get rich quick scheme, like Michael burry is invested in Hollywood video and the ceo of petco bought ten shares to take it over so it can switch to e-video, you’ll jump ship from it, I’ll grab some more.

A little Alcoa history/DD for you retards: Company founded in 1888. It’s the eighth largest aluminum miner/manufacturer in the world.

Sell options, do not buy them. Sell weeklies trying to make 0.5-3% a week.Sell puts on companies you wouldn't mind holding, but only after they dip significantly. If you are forced to buy sell calls against the shares you own. Do this for next 10 years.

You'll be rich by then. 32 is still young, especially if you take care of your body with good food and exercise.

They put a sell limit order on their stake, in today’s instance, 130,000+ shares with a limit sell of $600. You would need a fuck ton of buying pressure to break through that.

GME has basically been at the same short interest for over a year... WSB has been talking about this since August 2019... if you’re happy leaving equity in GME for a long period with no guarantee of a short squeeze then you do you. Personally I think there are far better plays. Also the VW squeeze has completely different dynamics to GME. It had a very high institutional ownership (local government and Porsche at 20/35% respectively). Porsche announced it had another 30% in calls it was going to exercise. Essentially the liquidity able for people to cover there shorts was substantially less than the case of GME (high liquidity and low institutional ownership).

here, getting ready to blast off once we start running news on this bitch
The US is really tough on capital gains compared to Canada. In Canada, only 50% of your capital gains is considered income - the other half is tax-free. Also, if you live in a house for 2 years, then sell it, your entire capital gain is tax-free. In contrast, the US maintains a cap of $250k tax-free profit on the house.

I'm about to become a US resident next year for work, but this tax shit is really making me think about other alternatives.

Yeah, I'm regressing the next 5 day's returns on a daily sentiment score and its pretty grim, the historical 5 day correlation is much higher, but still bad.
Or it trades flat?

I'm not sure how LA lockdowns or a fresh batch of COVID numbers would suddenly tank the stock tomorrow. All airlines/cruises made big moves recently. Investors are piling in for the run ups when things start to pick up again next year. I don't think they're looking to exit the position tomorrow. Look at the volume on all of them. 2-3x averages.

Not saying it can't go down tomorrow but your justifications seem ambitious. You don't think 'COVID is here and fucking shit up for cruises' hasn't been priced in yet and investors will wake up tomorrow thinking 'oh yeah, a pandemic' and sell off?

Don't get me wrong, the approach of 'buy puts at the peak of a runup' and 'buy calls at the bottom of a selloff' is a tried and true method. I don't think you need to come up with already baked in narratives to justify it. Just say 'stock went up, i buy puts'.

Spy Puts? Who the fuck is dumb enough to buy those???
The statisticians are analyzing a dataset that was:

\- reported in batches that were submitted to the reporting system irregularly

\- both automatically and manually managed by systems admins

\- subject to sudden spikes in reported ballots due to deadlines being met, such as those that allowed mail-in ballots to be counted at different times based on when they were received

You can't do a fucking time based analysis on a dataset as erratic as that and make idiotic conclusions like the results being statistically impossible because of spikes or 'injections'. And what 'thousands' of people? I watched several hours of the recent Giuliani hearing and almost all the people there didn't even say they found evidence of fraud. One guy was rambling about someone making a backup of a backup drive storing the electronic data and transporting it without knowing where it would ultimately end up and another old man was actually saying he was concerned because he saw a young Asian man and then started rambling about China. The colonel didn't say he found election data coming/going out of the country, he said he saw unknown packet traffic going to Germany. If you've ever run a server before you'd know packet data comes and goes from all over the world at all times for various reasons including botnets scanning your ports. It was a non story and he had to start talking about the error in Antrim county that was corrected almost immediately and was possibly the result of human error according to the poorly trained clerk's testimony in another hearing. Where is all this evidence? There's fucking nothing. There's been so much debunked nonsense it's infuriating. I could go over the list but I've done that a thousand times.

So who pays on the flip side if the company goes bankrupt and shorts don't have to give those shares back. The broker loses? By agreeing to their clients short position they are accepting the risk it might go bankrupt? What does the broker get out of it?
Good luck fellow bear. I tried doing PLTR puts through earnings and got buried.

Just keep an open mind to what you hear about new tech and especially IPO dates. They can be fickle and totally wrong tho the IPOs, so I would say just mostly bank on what you think sounds like it can't fail. AmD for instance is graphics cards for not only computers but BOTH of the mainstream consoles to release this year. Or if you're rich buy Amazon. When I first got into trading I always like holy fuck do I really wanna put 700 bucks into one stock of Amazon? Anyways one of the best stocks I've picked.
Stop trying to pump snow you retards.  The underwriters and institutional investors already fucked it up.
$20-22 but sold a couple times. Current average is $47 but I’ve cashed out many covered calls along the way
[This guy](https://youtu.be/RbYJf4vm2go). Not that it means a lot. Just one guys opinion after all.
Just wanted to say you and I are of the same mind. I told a few people it was peaking on that high volume day (don’t think they listened though), and sold my shares for +100% on the morning move up the next day and been watching for a touch of the trendline.

Optimally would have liked to see volume drop even more today or maybe tomorrow but sometimes that doesn’t get to happen before it moves again
What day next week

You ever type "quad witch" into pornhub search?
AMD hit an ATH today and is in its third consecutive green week. It hasn’t had four consecutive green weeks since early February. This probably means nothing but it’s something worth noting
What did you do differently?
It is definitely free money, can't go tits up, but don't expect ATH anytime soon. Sell off was so extreme because the Slack purchase was very very expensive.
Like what? Those are great long term holds
No better option than tsla

huh? Get out of you dumb bitch
With that math I'd say you're in trouble.
The way a call option works is it's essentially "worth" the difference in the stock price and strike price (strike is 50).  Thats a simplification because that doesnt consider the ability to sell it before then but good enough for now.  200 contract x 100 is the right to buy 20,000 shares at $50 on that date.  $5 is the difference needed to cover the initial cost.  Anything less than $50, theyre worthless, between 50-55 he'll get back some, but still be down.  Every dollar the price is over 55 is $20k profit.
On a scale of 1 to WSB how ‘tard are you?

Spy 1 delta calls (~255) for Jan 15
When a company can't meet demand it can be bullish. It  depends why they couldn't meet it though. If they can't meet demand because the demand for their product has gone up 500% yoy, that is bullish. If they can't meet demand due to supply chain issues, lack of skilled labor, poor resource usage etc., then its not bullish.
One thing to note here is that I am only showing option returns for options that had volume >= 10,000. I meant to add that to the footer of this image

Saw mad inflow today on calls
Iraseal produces lots of radiology equipment. The temperature/humidity  over there are perfect for the assembly of CT and XR tubes. When I looked into this company for future investment,  I saw a company  that made a better wheel. Problem I see,  selling that wheel to an installer that has lots of experience and equipment set up for installing the traditional wheel. Possible, with a retrograde fit and new software to correct rhe reconstructed images but highly doubtful for an established imaging department. These cameras are mostly under contract from Seimens, GE, etc and wouldn't cover add-ons. However, newer cameras are being installed all across the US even though  the healthcare system is strained now. These cameras are like cars and each year get better, faster and cheaper to make so it would sense to incorporate their tech into the future cameras. Camera Imaging systems usually run about every 5-7 yrs before they get replaced. I never bought the stock, but wish I had when the SP was cheaper.

The range in energy names has been crazy lately. I’ve never seen it like this before, crazy times.
I think it will be an uneven process. Meaning the major indices won't all top and drop together. Money will be rotated around (back and forth between "reopening" and "reclosing" trade) until it slowly begins to sink in to investors that they're simply not getting the returns for the amount of risk they are assuming.

With regard to the fundamental business model, I think there's going to be some demand when forbearance sunsets and people start defaulting on their mortgages in significant quantities, as the job market spends the next five years trying to recover (go look at how long that took for the GFC... same thing here, especially after the mortgage defaults kick off in earnest).  

The new "Frugal Formula" is going to be Van Life+Gym Membership+AirB&B rental treats.  Calling it now.
The run up in gold over the last 2 years has nothing to do with Covid and everything to do with the failure nof the Fed and QE. Gold broke from its 2 year trend in November on vaccine news. To rejoin the trend, gold needs to hit 2k in the next 2 weeks.

You should. When your done I think you'll agree with me.
I have never, ever talked to a girl under the age of 30 about stocks. The only female I ever have talked to about stocks is my mom, who is nearly 70...
I don't need balls anymore, they only lead to children.

Seeing $15K vanish in two days makes sense to cut losses, but I bought most of them back (several times at a good loss) and diversified a little. Those funds are spoken for. That's Tesla Roof, and down payments (or more) for Model Y/CT, anything else goes back to mortgage/child college fund. Now that I'm reading/learning about options, I think the first $5K past $100K will be for testing. Why risk it all when 1% of $100K is $1K? But then again, why have 100K, when you can have 0K 🤔? 

Margins let you borrow 40% of your account at a 5% annual rate broken up , plus $5/mo for Gold. I'm paying $70 this month so far, borrowing $42K to keep those gains rolling (which probably account for $7K of those earnings).
Gasoline, energy, gasoline, metals, food prices all soaring but people will buy a 10 year bond that yields less than 1 percent? Wtf is going on?

What's a reasonable IPO price range?
Yeah I'm buying 10 contracts for $50 1/22C
No, around 60k. Because I collected the 10.30 in premium. Yes, I only use margin for these kinds of things. Typically LEAPS will provide 10% return on long dated puts for ridiculous strike prices. For example , $3 Ford for .30. It’s a way to use margin without having to pay interest.
Yet open will still be down
No dummy GME is an aggressive growth tech stonk, dividend says it's done growing. It's like $NET except for shitty strip mall retail instead of internet infrastructure. Dividend bad

End of winter is March 20, 2021.  Q1 2021 is January 1 - March 30., 2021.  The company during last the last prior earnings call have stated that they plan to have start commercial operations with Richard Branson being on the first flight.  So while it’s certainly possible that commercial operations may start after March 20th, it very likely or at least possible for commercial operations to start this winter.

Test flight on December 11 - completes FAA certification if successful 

Rehearsal flight of crew members - this will compete the testing program 

Launch of commercial operations with Richard Branson being on first commercial flight.  This will be followed by customers who have reserved tickets.

If not true please provide link that Richard Branson’s flight is not a commercial flight.  I will gladly retract my comment.

Substitute products is irrelevant.

Tesla has higher margins than the rest. Just like Amazon versus Walmart

And Tesla is aggressively investing in other growth areas outside of their core competency. Just like Amazon.

They also ship more EVs than VW. Eurotards just buy VW cause no more dieselgate. Tesla will have a German factory soon enough which should help with local pricing.

I agree with the amount of short volume , but it's also the question of who pulls first.

Doubt they will. They had the time and early advantage to stake their claim and keep it. But they failed. Now other automakers are here and already taking ground.

> moat they're digging between themselves and literally anyone else is getting deeper and wider every day

Disagree completely. Other makers are coming up close in all areas, and are also bringing decades of experience in not only making great cars, but also branding. And build quality. And support. 

> I believe it's likely Tesla will end up with 10 years of dominance starting 2023ish and the price of the stock reflects that wide belief.

Nah, the stock reflects the meme that it is. Tesla won't achieve 10 years of dominance. They've had their time, and their chance to build a great brand, deliver quality products, and offer excellent support. And they didn't succeed a lot at that. We will see, but I think Tesla will become a niche manufacturer while the main automakers fill all the other niches.

I think PLTR is worth more than $50 after the next ER. There is a huge difference revenue with the last ER because they got big contracts this year.  🚀🚀🚀
Yes Im rich off of the two shares I have for them 🤡

Seriously though during the couple days around their earnings they went from 600 to 840. But no one talked about it here because it's not a meme stock

USB Upgrades AMAZON to a "Buy" with a price target of $4000
PFE said the supply chain new news wasn’t true. The early November numbers were 50 million vaccines this year and 1.3 billion in 2021.
Its been a while since i looked at them. Not sure if you know this or not, maybe you can help, but I think there was a clause saying in the event of a credit upgrade that would remove some of the restrictions on what they can do with their capital.

Paying off the notes early on 12/11 may lead to a credit upgrade shortly after which would give them more optionality.
If not next week then probably spring.

Rich man poor man
They are NOT starting commercial operations this winter. Branson's flight is "at the end of Q1". That could possibly be winter but might be first week of spring. We also don't know if the recent Covid delay pushes that back into early Q2.

Also, Branson's flight is not a commercial flight. During the last earnings call, they described it as the first flight of what they call "experience testing" (as opposed to testing the technology, which is what these next two flights are doing). They did not describe how long this "experience testing" will take, but I personally, from pulling shit out of my ass, would assume that this testing takes at LEAST 6 weeks, if not longer. That puts true commercial operations not starting until mid-Q2 at the earliest and \*possibly\* not before late Q3. Early July is a fair bet, I'd think.
If that stimmy bill passes I don’t see how we’d ever get a massive dip. Maybe a pull back, but you’re right, we’re on placid waters now.
Logic does seem to be the enemy of success at this point. Trend following while being just shy of FOMO is the fine million dollar line.
Yeah and you have all these people griping about how WSB has changed and it sucks now and blah blah blah

Worse EVs? Hard disagree. They're just getting started, and already filling niches with economies of scale that Tesla can't even dream about just yet. 

For the majority of people, Teslas's ridiculous range is irrelevant. Tesla's ridiculous acceleration is irrelevant. Hence why they're losing ground in important EV markets in Europe. Shit, even Chinese-made EVs are outselling Teslas in some parts of China. 

> Once tesla releases a new 4 door with 700 mile range at 25k and the build quality of a lexus

Hah. That will never happen. Put a remindme 20 years. 

> Why would you buy their cars - ICE or EV?

Why? For one, service. Teslas's "dealer" experience have all sounded dreadful to me. The lack of support after sales is also baffling. Good luck getting service if you live in a smaller town! Then, Tesla will never equal the build quality of the bigger/classier makers. I'm sorry, they have decades of experience building incredible machines. Tesla won't ever get there. 

Tesla will find a niche and thrive there. But it won't be the leading manufacturer in the EV market.
Yes, you are.

15-20% on BABA is really optimistic. It might move up enough to sell at a better price before expiration though. JKS has earnings coming up on 12/7 so it will depend a lot on that. DKNG is going to need some strong positive news to hit that. I think CRSR has a chance though.

100 seemed high to me too...but if you look at the history, GME basically squeezed to 90 in both of the last console cycles (when accounting for share buybacks, 90 a share would hit similar market cap). 

But those squeezes were slow and with much less short interest. Very possible we go higher

If you're actually new to this here's real advice:

Don't YOLO it. 

I would sell what you have and invest inn safer/long term stocks that are still rising. Examples being Microsoft or Apple. Consider if you put 5k into Microsoft 5 years ago you would now have 21k. You have nearly 20k right now, consider where putting that kind of money into a safe company and leaving it there over the next few years will do for you. 

Though consider that you will pay **at max** 30% of your profits in taxes next year. Ex: You put 100k into a stock and it goes up to 130k. You cash out. You pay tax on that 30k (depending on short/long term gains and such it will be roughly 20-30%.)
Can futures just go... like... a little more red?

Robinhood should have some built in feature that identifes which of your FDs printed then pops up ads to buy company merch.
I don't think so. But the point is the company itself is very unlikely to be engaging in fraud because they are audited by a reputable firm. 

And there's 3 years for the Chinese and US government's to figure out how to proceed. You reeeally think every Chinese stock will be delisted? Seems highly unlikely.

More likely result IMO is that Chinese companies end up with stricter auditing requirements which gets rid of the actual scams and tiny companies with questionable financials, while larger legit companies are mostly unaffected beyond some temporary dips.

Most of the posts reflect the past situation rather than predict anything. Stocks go up, sentiment is positive, down negative. So unless you somehow filter for the posts that are predicting the future, you are likely to get the random result. The other problem is that this sub has a lot of jargonisms that reflect sentiment ("to the moon", "full retard" etc.) and plenty of unknown words. I am not sure if SA performs that well here. I would also say that orthography and syntax are in general worse here than in other subs. Basically, you are dealing here with a domain specific corpus that need text normalisation so an off-the-shelf NLP tool is likely not to be able to generalize.

People who are truly yolo, are not actually yoloing so do not follow suit. Just throwing a fast ball out there, but the ones truly yolo have the funds to do it whether that be disposable income, or money they  accrued through investing and their yolo money is "free money". 

Yolo your savings while trying to make ends meet is not wise. Just saying. I would suggest invest some of your money in speculative aka meme stocks, profit and build on that profit to gain some free money to yolo. It's never a true yolo for most retards.
if this is your expectation why didn’t you enter your position gradually so you could average down??

Has anyone got some good looking tickers for Japanese EV's? Especially newly IPO stuff.
Here's a much cheaper way to control 100 shares of TLSA...for 1 day.

Example:

\+2 TSLA Dec4 580C

\-1 TSLA Dec4 595C

This is a back-ratio debit spread, but the strikes are carefully selected such that the premium collected on the ATM call pays for the premiums of the two ITM calls.  In this example (market close 12/3), this spread costs $2625.  Since the two ITM calls have intrinsic value, you have to leave a "damage deposit".  (i.e. ITM/ATM debt spread with negating premiums) Net zero extrinsic value means that theta and IV is a don't care.

This is \~100 delta, so it performs like 100 shares of TSLA.  $100 gain/loss for every $1 gain/loss.  As the price goes down, you start to lose some of your "damage deposit".  The most you can lose is $2625 (price of debt spread).  However, there's no limit to upside (aside from only having 1 day).  If TSLA jumps up $50 tomorrow, you make $5k.  If TSLA drops $50 tomorrow, you only lose $2625.  If TSLA goes up $1, you make $100.  Drops $1, you lose $100.  Be sure to accept nothing less than mid fills.

Yet your post title, true autism 🚀🚀 PLTR
That’s the risk I’m considering as well. You could do what I’ve done and open a partial position. If we hit lockdown fear mode and it dips, I’ll add more. This is the benefit of buying calls 1.5-2months out. You get flexibility. 

All my biggest wins have been because I averaged down during low points, and ended up having a sizeable position when it recovered. 

Doesn’t always work. 

But analysts are pretty bullish on them now, go check out their Price Targets. And their chart says they are ready for a breakout from a TA perspective. So I’m rolling with it. Call it a gamble

Full disclosure- I am a total idiot
The Ford Focus was a sweet touch

Buddy you’re killing me. I don’t think they’re implying Africans are slow to adopt. I think they’re underscoring the opportunity and that’s it. And I have no idea now NFLX plans to ever be profitable :/

Ya, I loved their stubs premier plan that had a subscription model for moviegoing, but it wasn't really profitable until it became the HBOMax of moviegoing. 

I was betting that the us wasn't going to let movie theaters collapse, but it doesn't seem like the political arena is really going to save them. and if they're doing this, then they can't get any free loans / insured loans from the government anymore.

what do you think is implied when the first slide in their presentation points out 4 facts: 1.3B population, 523M internet users, 17M SMEs/merchants, and $4T in household/B2B spending... then in the next slide they say we have 6.7M annual active users and 110k active sellers. they are implying that the African market is slow to adopt technology but it is demographically huge so we should just wait.

I snowboard and stuff but you have to realize their potential is so limited. What you said abt outdoor sports is like maybe 10% true for the entire population, why? Because the ocean and mountains are only available to select people, like 60-70% of the states are land locked and the accessibility is lower to be able to go to a mountain and etc. Gyms are actually growing, and ask anyone who works out where they go to more the gym or the beach/mountains 9/10 times they say gym. 
I’m not trying to shit on you but logically that’s not true it’s very inaccessible to go to the mountains or beach everyday, and for those who are land locked it’s very expensive.

Thats my set up too.
No. 1. I sold them when the price of PLTR was $29 for $10.30 with a strike of $22. 2. I was suppose to buy to close next day but I was fucked up on drugs. My buy to close would have been a 10% gain. The price of PLTR has gone down an entire $5 and the last price of the puts I sold is $10.54.

My break even is $11.70 pltr. The puts are all time premium so no one is going to exercise and if they are that stupid then I’ll just resell to recollect the time premium the guy just wasted on exercising.

My trade was ducking amazing but I fucked it up by getting fucked up.

I’d be interested in seeing how accurate DD posts were overall. If the stock actually moved within the weeks following their initial post. Any retard can post a one liner “AMC going to MOON trust me.” DD are closer to attempted prediction.

Just remember, when big firms like Morgan Stanley raise their price targets, their already in and want to dump at a higher price. When they lower their price targets, they want to get in cheaper because they didn't get the chance before. PLTR is the perfect example, by now they have probably bought in, hence why Cramer is pumping it.

The intraday low in 2009 occurred on March 6th (3/6/09) at SPX 666. This was the nadir of the "worst financial crisis since the great depression" or however it was marketed.

Let's look at that again, on **03/06/09** the bear market ended and the 11 year bull market began as the SPX reached a low of **666**.

Yesterday the SPX closed at **3669**. Today it closed at 3**666**.  


1. The dollar has be devalued for 7 months (since announcing that he prints it digitally) and has reached an important low (the same level it was at when Yellen left the Fed).  

2. Interest rates are as low as they're ever going to get (unless we go NIRP), real rates are ticking up.  

3. Investment grade corporate debt is now yielding LESS than 10 year breakeven rates (inflation indexed treasury paper).  

4. Stonks have gone up straight up for 9 months in the midst of a pandemic and global economic collapse...but now seem to have trouble making any substantial gains (topping is a process)  

5. Valuations have never been this stretched. They're truly in an entirely different reality.  

6. Speculation has spiraled out of control. 12 year old kids are making and losing big money gamboooling in stonks via their mobile phones.  

7. Analysts are racing to see who can set the highest price target on the one stock that represents this phase of the advance (Tesla)
You have that backwards. People who meant to buy LAZR bought LRGR instead.
INO mooning AH
Bravo!

After reading this, I get the impression that short sellers are not making the same mistake twice and have been liquidating their positions recently. I’m not a technical trader (or much of a trader at all) but it seems like most days any upward pressure is pushed back down between about $15.50 and $16.00 at which point we see prices back above $16 for awhile.

My impression is that the $15.75 mark is where short sellers are trying to cover their positions right now to limit losses ahead of earnings on the 8th.

So, we may not see the “infinity squeeze” if they’ve been able to take advantage of the dips in share price, but we should at least see some stability or upward pressure, assuming no negative surprises from earnings.
I'm not saying that cruises aren't fun or people don't like them, it's the issue of debt.

There are no such thing as $175P on GME.  You can't buy an option at a strike that doesn't exist. The Market Makers have to create the strike prices in order for anyone to sell the option at that strike and no one is going to sell that strike even if it existed.

Time to get your revenge on the movie industry and their wormy $12 sodas and $20 slurpees.

AMC is going bankrupt. Load up on puts and win your lunch money back.
So you start counting in some shitty potdunk town and trump is winning 70% to 30% out of 1000 votes. Over time when the sample size gets bigger and they count cities and mail in ballots the lines converge and Biden leads. It’s impossible! He was winning at the start of the graph and then he lost! It’s statistically impossible. I know this because im a stable genius.
Good idea
0.11% Up
It's really good. I should rewatch it just to get my mojo back once bars reopen again.
Yeah it went up a ton, but can only stay irrational so long. Already started to pull back after bad Pfizer news
Nope, that's a $100k worth of calls that PLTR is $55.20+ by 1/2022...

Would a Supreme Court ruling in favor of the plaintiffs preclude a new IPO coming out of conservatorship? One that would wipe out existing shares? From my understanding the case is about the constitutionality of the dividend sweep. I assume that if it's ruled unconstitutional then it would mean existing shares would remain coming out of the conservatorship, but I can't find anything in news related to the case that explicitly states that or defines what the government's authority to "force" a new IPO would be in that case. I think the risk of a new IPO was a big reason people were staying away from these, right?

Super hopeful my 12/11 270C prints tomorrow 🙏
As someone in gold and silver heavy all year just don’t fkn do it. Nothing other than manipulation makes sense at this point. DXY shit it’s pants to $90.50 and we went down. That was supposed to be the catalyst to start us off. Every morning when Comex opens we lose .50c within the next minute. It’s just wack. Yea it’s gonna go eventually but since I’ve been holding literally every single sector has popped off, even other PM. Literally just gold and silver only thing that hasn’t gone yet. This is mental torture seeing red or flat everyday with one Green Day a month. Just stay away.

Wow 4400%. You can turn $10 -> nearly $1M if you can hit that kind of return 3x. It’s very possible too! Chances of buying the right option is 50/50 (you either buy an option that gives you 4400% return or you don’t). So you have the same chance of turn $10 -> nearly $1M as flipping heads on a coin 3x in a row.

Just understand this. If you think a stock is going up - you buy a call option. If you think it’s going down, buy a put option. Never buy an option that is expiring in less than 3 weeks. If it goes up a decent amount 20% for example, you should sell and collect your monies. Don’t be too greedy, don’t be scared to cut a losing trade and salvage some of the money. Options are not as difficult as they sound- you don’t have to know all the Greeks , etc in order to be successful - you will learn that stuff over time. Also know - if you are very wrong, your option could become worthless. So, only buy ones you are comfortable with losing the whole amount. Robinhood is good for beginner option trading.

That screen only works on currently open positions. I don't think you can do a full buy and sell record in one shot. Only buy page and sell page separately.

It was always FUD to buy cheap shares. Enjoy the $50s again soon
It blows my mind how much they will jump through hoops to defend the stance that any annual return beyond 5-10% is unrealistic or that beating SPY is just luck. Go tell that to the folks at ARK or Renaissance and they are going to laugh in your face.
All you need to know is the DXY keeps dropping ([https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DXY](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/index/DXY)), which usually means GLD and SLV will get a boost. Unfortunately, the economy keeps doing OK, so the insane pump we saw in the spring and early summer will likely not happen again. Expect returns conservative by a boomer's standards - just hope you stay ahead of inflation.

China isn't as big a threat as people think. They're made into the boogey man as cover for politicians and corporate leaders strip mining the middle class of the country.

As to the inequality of a United Western Liberal Democracies, it's a good question; I suspect there won't be a choice. It will be sold as a choice between "rising together or falling separately", and a common currency (digital BIS shitttkoins which is already being planned) will be the only way to pay and get paid.

Depends on what PM movement is. AH straight lined so honestly I have no idea
7 Day? It's been a 10+ year blood bath for BBY.

Former employee here, quit when shit was hitting the fan a few years ago. The company is an utter shit show. They don't make scraps off of selling anything but protection plans. But anyone dumping money in or considering it, here's your free pass.

Attachment rate (how many sales that had protection plans added) for sales people was 12.5%. meaning that if a sales person was doing reasonably well selling protection plans they were only generating real profit on 1/8th of their sales. The rest of those 7/8 sales have Best Buy corporate pulling their hair out wondering how many of them are going to be fired to cover product acquisition for relying on 0-3% margin to float the whole fucking company

# "They have in house brands!"

HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA

Rocketfish, Insignia, Dynex, etc are all broken ass shit that Best Buy spends at least double what their competitors do to *say* they made it and only have slightly better margin on them because they still have to pay the people who make the shit. Top Kek retard move on BBY for not scrapping them. And better yet almost all of that crap gets returned to the store and exchanged for a better quality product which means they lose out on that minimally better margin.

Now let's get down to management.

BBY is the laziest company in the fucking world when it comes to keeping the corporate arm in check. The majority of BBYs earnings are spent paying these retards. District managers, buyers, HR, all of them are waaaayyyyyy to comfortable in their positions. Trying to get anyone in that company to do their fucking job is like pulling your hair out. Office chatter sounds more like high school, especially in HR, and the average cock sucker is about 30, finished their bachelor's and applied for a corporate position while not selling shit to customers while on the clock.

Now let's get down to stores.

Maybe you've been to a Best Buy that has a Magnolia, Pacific, or other "high end" section. That's the only one in the district that BBY cares about because they use that one to cover up how utterly pathetic every other best buy within 25 miles is performing. The rest are spending 2 weeks worth of overtime/overnight pay every 3 months on fucking RSS corrections that inevitably show a metric fuck ton of stolen or lost inventory. Which then leads to cancelled orders, lack of faith, and even more loss.

Hearing all of that and knowing that Amazon and Walmart are literally throat fucking this walking corpse of a company out of business on a yearly basis.

What's 0dte?
Its last acquisition before slack was tablaeu(15bn). When the acquisition was announced it dipped and recovered to its normal trading range in a matter of days

when the acquisition was finalized, it dipped and stayed low for about a month before going back to its normal trading range. 

about 4-5 months later it started to hit new highs.

Not saying the exact same thing will happen this time, but fortunately there's precedence to this move that we can predict to a degree. Personally I'd go with LEAPs at this level. I'd only stay out if something fundamentally changed with the company, like microsoft eating slacks lunch. But clearly there's value in slack which led to its acquisition.
The product is still getting sold and is getting into consumers' hands, whether it's a third party seller or scalper or whatever. Your logic is non existent and for that reason, all in calls

Was looking at /r/buildapcsales and, sharing in their same experiences, it seems every time a Ryzen or AMD GPU goes in stock it is gone within seconds. Has been impossible to find available inventory and even when I had an order in place it was delayed in arrival for a week beyond the initial in-stock estimate.

Edit: Adding some further proof to it. [Look at the search page for Ryzens](https://www.bestbuy.com/site/searchpage.jsp?st=ryzen). In my area 14 of the 24 are not available for purchase online. Either sold out, unavailable nearby, or "Find a Store."

CNK and AMC are fuk IMO - this isn't just a COVID blip in the share price, this is a paradigm shift for the long-term outlook of the theater industry. Will the other studios fall on their sword to save theaters? Or will they follow suit and start pushing their new releases on streaming services?

And what happens then? Half the customers that might have come back after a vaccine are going to watch shit at home rather than pay 400% food markup after a $10-$15 ticket. Studios could charge 30 bucks for new releases (knowing multiple people will probably watch them together) and still make more than their previous cut of theater tickets. Mulan has shown that people will pay it. Hell, 30 bucks will be a cost savings for customers when they don't have to pay 6 dollars for a fucking bottled water or $10 for basic bitch nachos.

COVID is bad, but there was a light at the end of the tunnel. This is something worse. The new normal for theaters is that half of their customers may never come back.
Why isn’t anyone talking about BCRX on here?

Chump has no intention of handing over a functioning economy.
All new eyes. You will lose money doing this. But consider it tuition. You will do stupid trades but it’s  Part of the deal. The only way to learn is to cannonball into the middle of the ocean...in my opinion. 

Take time to read the serious posts around here and pick up the wisdom from the big boys. 

There will always be someone smarter..richer..and luckier than you. Accept it. Move on. And just worry about you. 

There is no other place on the internet where you will find raw unadulterated truth,wisdom, and literal degeneracy. 

Welcome home.

I'm bullish as fuck about GME, regardless of squeeze.

Also they sell pc stuff now, and are expanding into community and esports stuff as well
Algo's set to 0.20% daily advances. SPX closed down 0.06% so futures are capped at +0.26%.

Btw, SPX closed at 3-666 today (yesterday 3669). If you dont understand why that's significant, the devil is in the details (see 03/06/09)

Doubling up. This is the way.
First I made 10k in two weeks from 10k. Then lost it all but $400. Had that 400 in TSLA before the s&p news. Now back to 11k, 1k profit baby
Made a withdrawal the other day of about 70% of my portfolio because i had started to develop a habit of YOLOing any good sized profits I acquired onto some stupid weekly because “it’s profit who cares.” Wanted to be responsible for once. Already regretting it. Investing is fucking boring let me gamble
Ngl, I bought back in today too.
I remember seeing this same shit argument before
I remember when everyone was freaking out over some triple witching hour bullshit in like April. Well that short squeeze never happened and I lost like half my shit

There's a decent number of tech stocks that peaked in 2000 and have never recovered since, or only recently recovered. Although some of them were giving out good dividends so the stock price wasn't as important.

I think this market run can last longer than people think it will. We've never had a world that was waiting on pins and needles for a vaccine, it's a new precendent. Using valuation models/charts to try to predict something that hasn't happened before is what's keeping people "waiting for the dip" and pushing the market higher.

If you are short a stock that pays a dividend, you owe the shareholder that dividend.

It is true that issuing dividends will lower the stock price normally, but announcement of a dividend policy usually increases the price in anticipation of the faster payout structure. Shorts, anticipating payment of not just their interest rates but also the dividend payments, will scramble for the exits.
Hilarious that you work in private equity yet don't know that technical analysis is total bullshit. Stick to the private markets bro

You'll be printing money.
I'm in May and June. Just trended down all day after a good open.
There are a couple IPOs coming up I'm considering

-Affirm (made by paypal mafia for people bad with money to finance impulse buys like pelotons, yeezys, & playstations)

-Roblox kind of like minecraft/fortnite meets social network for middle school kids. Prints money with microtransactions preying on their undeveloped brains & access to parents credit cards.

-Airbnb is the wild card they are burning cash like uber/lyft but I wonder if hotels are fading away to an extent. If you want a disruptive real estate play wouldn't be too bad to have a small position.

What to you guys think?
The way I look at it, it’s you’re fucking ass. And your shitting. It’s not clean regardless of what you do it on. But if it’s a nasty looking toilet with piss and shit then fuck that, my ass is cleaner than that.

Take half out.  Pay off debt, stash some for the lurking tax bill, and then go to Wendy's, and eat some hand battered tendies.  If you still have cash, get a roomba, and a blinged out buttplug. Dont keep too much in your gambling account.  Its too easy to lose your gains.

A nice point to swan dive from when it's announced they haven't agreed on a stimmy by the 10th and that most of the high travel states are locking down for Christmas.
It's not common to execute early because you're throwing away time value. You mostly see it if there are dividends or for investor votes.
Webull is really fucking impressive honestly

It's everything robinhood isn't and has so many features and shows you literally every stat financial or technical possible. The ability to use comments is also really useful.

I am leaving a comment just so I can refer to it tomorrow when PLTR opens at 20.
wtf is JitB?

Am I the only pltr bag holder?
You're not gonna get the crazy gains that you see some of these autist post on here, but I think you're a lot more likely to stay in the green. Its been working for me lately. Wait, what am I saying, you should buy 1k tesla calls for next friday.
Maybe June. That’s why you see everyone say buy shares.
The attention to multiple minute charts 😓. Do you trade usually just one thing?
TSLA is a short destroyer it’s pretty obvious by now
Honestly, someone asked me earlier what my strat was. Pick 5-10 stocks I like (usually ones that I see recurrently on Reddit and other discord servers), buy the dip and sell high.
if i’m gonna be retarded, i’m in for the long haul
Thanks for the advice man
You’re not special we’re all professionals
They paid it off early.

I think like 300 mil
Sometimes I find myself using wsb in real life scenarios. This is peak autism
The rip up early next week or entering next week?
Why is it necessary though? Can it really rise and fall in hours?
Yeah I heard about the Microsoft deal, but it didn't seem that impressive tbh.  My problem is, what can Gamestop bring to these new ventures that other companies can't?  I mean, if Xbox needed to do these things(distribute games, esports stuff ect.) then they would be better served doing it in house so they could keep all the profits, or hire a company that already has the infrastructure in place.  Gamestop's biggest asset is their massive real-estate holdings, but if they're switching to e-commerce then that's a liability at worst or hopefully a source of more cash(which they have a ton of already).  I could understand if Microsoft was bringing Gamestop along for brand appeal, but I honestly don't know anyone that likes the place.  It was one of those stores you did business with because you *had* to.  They might find a niche and reinvent themselves, but into what Idk.
1. "Why are you keep buying?"  This grammar is solid Harbor Freight 100% pure Chinesium.  Boys, Winnie Xi Pooh is watching us.
2. This GIF ended too soon.  >!Prepare to buy PLTR and watch GME explode.!<
Depends on what they are...
Getting in on pump and dumps,  better put a limit above the ask based on how much it's moving per second. Same deal for options that move fast.  Ask won't fill.
Would you ever let them expire?
You are definitely a bear.
LOL

Jan 2022 TSLA  leaps 1000 strike. I either get big tendies or go broke. Win win situation imo
what was it?
Can you link some pretty easy to use ones. I have some ITM options and would like to know when to offload
Repost
This is the way
About 4hrs late. Good job.
Do people actually think PLTR will survive tomorrow?
pretty safe plays imo
wtf newest comment was 3 minutes ago? thread is dead
Tesla is still supply constrained, they are selling all the cars they can make.  Until we see a demand issues I am confident Tesla will maintain if not grow their market share.  They are still ramping up the factory in China and plan to have two new ones starting to produce cars next year.  Keep in mind that all three factories currently under construction will produce more (a lot more) cars than any other factory in the whole when fully operational.

Also, for example you see VW gaining there.  This is due to the hype on releasing their new EV.  However, that EV is generally low quality and as more people take delivery and provide real reviews the hype will die.  Same thing can be expected for most legacy automakers.

Unfortunately there isn’t much gas left in the “to the moon” autism so mm will keep it below 25 tomorrow to take those premiums, however my right nut is tingling like it might push 30 next week.
My plan is to see the open and go opposite at ten thirty. You know I’m a lot smarter than most people on here because I wrote out the time. I’m super smart. The smartest. The market bows to me.

Duuuude me too. Exact same position. Thinking of liquidating one of my positions tomorrow and buying back in. You sons-a-bitches better be right!
🙋‍♂️
Good math sir. (54*14) + 12
Ok
This seems awfully specific... but also accurate
That’s not quite true. Each unit originally had 1/3 of a warrant attached. Then on the date it split 1/9 of a warrant detached. This leaves 2/9 still attached. These remaining warrants don’t separate until after the merger is completed. So technically I have 200 more warrants still attached to my 900 shares.
Old news dumb bear
Ok
The more liquid something is the safer it is. If you're talking about stonks then it's fine if you're trading something that isn't dogshit.

If you're talking about options... well, at the beginning of your career, that's when.

But in all regards the legacy car markers are making worse EVs. And Tesla are (I would argue) accelerating away from even those poor efforts from legacy auto.

Once tesla releases a new 4 door with 700 mile range at 25k and the build quality of a lexus, and automation - what will the other manufacturers do? Why would you buy their cars - ICE or EV?
why?

Just for fun.
Pls daddy
Greatest of all time!!!!!!!!!
Hahah this was even funnier to me because I think you decided it wasn't even worth explaining why
Still new to calls so did he say the stock call would go up to 17.5 but it surpassed that amount and climbed to 25.29 which is why he made money or am I missing something from this picture?
Should be buying TSLA instead
Oh trust me brotha man I don’t, but that’s too wordy, and I’m just fuggin around
Lmao why
🤡🤡🤡🤡
I lost it there too
those calls are going to print harder than the mint itself
Earnings expectations are pretty low, wouldn't be unreasonable to beat them.
OP just wtf are you thinking? Buy the 30k shares and hold a year or two.
Most won't let you do that.  The stock is cheap enough just to buy 100 shares and do covered options.

Naw it’s got a much better long term growth story.  It shouldn’t be at 40 right now, but it’s got a good enough business model that there is value long term.

Lmfao there is a 100% chance that David Perdue, the sitting Senator of Georgia, is aware of this sub. 2600 trades PER TERM. And he was doing options. I mean, COME ON.
calls too, cause why tf not...I won on getting the NIO/Xpeng dip and put a little into it

Guy leading it may be the right kind of special mind, ya know. I love that storyline in general, people appreciate him for his special weirdness.

Idk honestly. But ban bets are rarely held accountable anymore. That’s where I’d come in. Tag or DM me enough and I’d check it out. Or someone who is already a mod should take this role. We just scream MODS and hope one notices. We need an executioner
what the fuck now. Snap jumps 5% on what
Very nice work, OP! What’s especially nice is the smooth curve up, no major dips along the way. Everyone’s risk tolerance is different, but I’ll take a smooth upward trajectory over a more aggressive upward saw-tooth pattern any day of the week.
After losing lots of money... Just buy and hold for retirement.
Man al the airline and cruise ship stocks are way up. I bought delta at the height of the pandemic and I’m up 60 percent of course I only put like $80 in on that. But my dumbass put $2k into pltr practically at peak price.

No. 

Everything done in US academic research labs are publicly available. Once something becomes an IP, it's publicly available for all to see. Trade secrets are where it's at.  National Labs go through huge vetting process which can take months. US researchers get funding based on their outputs, they can import the best Chinese students so they can secure more funding. University takes a nice 30% cut. 

F1 students have a much harder time getting onto work visas but people with graduate degrees go on a different track so it becomes much easier to immigrate to the US. Chinese students take longer to get visas because of the vetting process. You can check how long it takes for visas to be processed at each embassy.

Good idea. It’s a pretty volatile one and we’ve got a while to go before things go back to normal, so I think I’ll wait and hope for my next buying opportunity and just buy more at higher strike with similar expiry since 2022 is probably far enough. I don’t think I’ll sell this one, since I didn’t put much in. I’ll just buy some new contracts.

Not saying the companies are similar at all, talking about ownership breakdown
Agree to disagree. I’ve seen this story b4. It’s too cheap at an Enterprise to EBITDA value of only 5x. Forward PE of only 9. Big buyback program should place a floor on the stock. Doubt it falls below 40. Plus they have been been beating estimates. The stock has been falling since they don’t seem to be an innovator any longer but I think it’s a short term issue. Only time will tell.

Whelp NIO and Xpeng is about what I expected, slow recovery over the next week once people realize the water is fine....followed by huge mooning and FOMOing middle of December by autists and boomers jumping back in. Gunna be a boring week theta gang wins this round

Yep, you're correct, they were issuing a nice dividend, pre-Rona. And I do understand your strategy of wanting to get a discounted price on equity in a v profitable organization.

However, they've slashed that dividend significantly, and it'll be years until they're to pre-Rona levels of profitability. I mean, this year, to stay afloat, they issued senior notes paying high interest, and issued additional common shares w/ a dividend. 

To sum it up: they have no current cash flow, they're hemorrhaging money monthly, NOBODY really knows when the virus will subside, virus is at all-time highs, I have a feeling that ships won't be able to operate at 100% capacity in 2021 in the US due to regulations, so I don't see revenue getting back to pre-virus levels until 2022 or 2023. So where is this arbitrary confidence coming from?

God this market is so damn weird.

And then me getting a wsb tattoo at 100 eo2021
I have January call I really want to roll out to April but I’m torn about rebuying at these high IVs
CRSR 36-37

PLTR 25-26

Lazr 24

Fuck you BB

Hopefully it ends this way
He might not taste it, but he will definitely blow out an o-ring in his ass when he shits fire.
Imagine not buying that apple dip...
33, your diamonds are going to get cut from going to the moon
This took a week.
Apple going green
Next week otherwise next year lol
Banned, he won’t post positions
Bought the ZS top like a FUCK!
I’m pretty sure 150,000, right?
Changed my mind, got a bad feeling about it.
Almost all PLTR, lost a good sum not pulling out last Friday but 🤷‍♂️
Anyone going for zscaler?
Buy nio whore you’ll lose everything
Not even close. Shorts are desperate.
lol wut

The theta on 12/31 250c is 0.12, while the delta is 0.18. The IV is only 48%.
It’s just like aristocratic Europe back in the days
Tesla $600 is on my wishlist this Christmas🎄 make it happen Papa Musk
Been cash gang for a little while, have never slept better but also feel dead inside 🥴🥴
AAPL finally bouta move eh?
Sold BA too early when it was up 5%
AAPL vs red RAW
this \*GME is a slow bleed.   SHould just strangle the heck out of it for the next foreseeable future.  These short sellers are controlling the price better than most thought.
Best news!!!!
Yeah, I'm thinking about throwing a trailing stop but they have a conference in the 13th. Might be a higher run. Their PDC delivery is pretty common might be a boomer and hold super long term
Goofy
Why you lying? Burry's been trimming his position and taking profit on the way up but he just posted 2 days ago that he's still in for 2MM+. Still massive outstanding shorts, squeeze hasn't hit yet.
My bowels were squoze
CCL easy fucking money
SNAP!
Jesus AAL short squeezing
AMD feels like it is bottoming out, or preparing to drill

Can't really tell which....
CCL is making me rock hard.
I bought ATM but OTM might be make more. 241 is top... I see 234-235 ish EOD and back to 240 tomorrow
Every time I buy FB calls Zuck cucks or the government cucks me
🐝 hive has been in their merger meeting for what feels like an entire day. Just vote dummies!!
Yeah, GME is partially a patience game between shorts and buyers. Could take a real long ass time.
The units are 1 common share + 1 warrant for a 1/3 share at 11.50.  warrants can be executed Oct 2021 or 30 days after merger, whichever is later.

Currently $10.71 a unit.

Don't bet the farm, but potential gains in a company with no revenue which may merge with another company.  That seems right up our alley.
Yessir

Positions ?
Lazr to the moon
1 year is the same as all time
Honestly was prepared to write off a $1400 loss this week on SNOW calls, crazy we are still going
Then go put it all in on 12/4 30c and make your millions.
Vote friday
Looks like I will see THC B like i put money in a HYSA earning .5% interest lol
>Don't go and buy this willy nilly, look into it and decide if its what you want first.

You're in the wrong place if you expect us to do any adequate DD before throwing our life savings at this
PLTR palms are sweaty, knees weak,  arms are heavy 

He’s nervous but on the surface he looks calm and ready, to print positions 

But he keeps forgetting, that he is a meme stock, WSB goes so loud, mr market opens up and the shares go down 

He’s chokin now everybody’s jokin now 
Clocks run out, market closed over blao 

Snap back to reality, there drops the share price 

Oop there he goes along with NKLA
Ya this is the way I’m switching after this Elon Tesla play
Time to buy in confirmed
Im new to this, bought calls for the second time. .59 Dec 24 did i do okay?
True, but I also think that Governments (at least ours in the UK, will go for the cheapest version available (DNA vaccine) for our national healthcare as its budget is fucked, already stretched). 

Also a lot more of the world is poorer than rich, so those countries governments will also probably choose the cheaper and easier to transport vaccine, so surely more long term profits in it for years to come distributing it to the 3rd world.
A company that makes lazers changing its ticker to LAZR was designed specifically for wsb autists.
I have $90 and $100 strikes. Might be a little too OTM but I got good fills. Let's do this 🚀
yeah.. we need melon to do some off the wall shit again to drop the value of the stock significantly..... so we can buy the dip again.
Heads for DOCU call, tails for DOCU put
Nice. I went ATM at 20 and for 2022. More conservative I guess. Maybe for these high conviction long term ones I should to further out the money.
[deleted]
Right? Head fake this morning
you are free? I charge 500 "roses"
Not yet
I want the PS5 and they sell the PS5 so therefore stock upward
we don't shame here we all have the same goal lad
Tsla calls all week!! To much upside
So excited to see this; we're gonna eat good for Christmas this yr
So thicc boi was a lie?
I should have bought into SPR after this post yesterday. Just insane jump the last two days.
LAZR GOGOGO
[Something like that](https://gyazo.com/5db3ea881552c6dc7197de0bf4bcc153)
PLTR is totally different than RKT due to market cap alone
A hearty fu to the bastids who got the ZS pickup. I think this might have teeth - may go in for round 2.
Guess no circuit breakers today? 🤡
Hey SPY stop fucking around
WDR 15 Jan 21 25p
Yeah they had a good reason to short but things have changed dummy
I’m only sad all of my buys didn’t go through. I had so many lotto tickets on CCL. They are PRINTING today.
Those companies are still growing faster and throw off huge amounts of cash.
Muthafuckin Ross from *FRIENDS* is the CEO of the London Stock Exchange 👀
What kind of money?
Babahaha best thing read all day!
Wait for it to dip first
My work 401 is at like 1%+ since March. My RH is at 5,000%. I'd like a boomer's "explanation" for this.
Should have sold it this morning my guy. At this point you should just hold and hope for a big AH run
In the face of vaccine approval next week?  Good luck with that.
Are you just buying shares then?
Ik
Probably Monday. I think after the recent run up lots of people are taking profit
I absolutely love when people gamble ‘rent’
It's from surveillance man if I remember. It's a youtube channel.
yeah, but shit ton of stuff to pay for this month so I only put like $300 in
What the fuck did you buy so I know to hop on that train now because you died for our sins.
I’ve stopped doing meme stocks and started playing boomer stocks. Since I’ve made the switch I’m up 60% on my port.
Nice.

I sold my calls when they were 3.5 and they went to 9.5 :o
No options available yet.
Travel is poppin
Just bought a bunch of NIO calls for Jan. Would recommend if you like money.
In this case it was pretty much a coin flip. In retrospect I should’ve just picked up both.
Thought about entering at 21 yesterday but thought it might dip some more today. Shouldn’t have waited.
After I puffed, yeah
The calls will 100% be exercised if they are at or above strike price on expiry.  Just cause the retard you sold them to decided to move on, somebody else still owns them.  They will either expire worthless on the expiry date below strike price, or they will be exercised and you will sell 100 shares per contract at the strike price.
CHWY 74c 12/18
Because they think Georgia stole the election from Trump.

I used to dip and rip daytrade on tech. New trend by algos seems to be pump pre-market then sell-off all day 🖕
Hands of diamond, head of steel $LAZR
Apple then... Same shit
Arlo is the way
Give it time. More bad news will come in the next couple weeks.
If PLTR breaks ath it’ll go to 40 on fomo alone, if it doesn’t soon it’ll be like RKT and lose meme status, trade flat at ipo price, and be forgotten 

Always fun to watch stocks that investors won’t touch and owned 80+% by retail retards
Dude nugt used to be the jam when it was 3x
Sure, why not

That is a nice surprise. Lol
Now I see and feel how dumb I am. Blessed be your day dear friend.
I'm in on ACB, new to this, it's nice to know I'm at least at the level of the most autistic people
Any gamble calls/puts?
WSB makes the bubbles. Then big companies make the bubble pop for profit.
I think its a buy. With autonomous driving and ev becoming the hot industry of the decade it should only go up
So far! Wait when they roll out a stimmy! 

Fact is I expected a blue wave and contested election... blue didn’t happen yet and contested did nothing lol
one short seller just reduced the size of his position against Tesla. 

Keep it up retards, you'll break em all! Including Burry.

God this has to be peak retardedness. Bulls are fuked
It’s crazy to see how many stonks are smashing through green days but the majority of Americans are going bankrupt, losing jobs, and going out of business.
Is the end Roblox world? That's amazing.
The last two times actually I’m pretty sure. This time will be different! Lol nah, I’ll probably close out EoD.
:S APHA... probs not tends to just like to stay flat. Theta and the IV will have taken their share of the pie

I lost 90% of my portfolio today cause of PLTR and NKLA. My 2 BA calls carried my portfolio so hard, that PLTR and NKLA are sucking its dick right now.
you're missing a few brain cells if you think the risk:reward is bad on PSTH

I’m shorting everything said the bear with $500 in the account
It sounds like you are in a terrible headspace and shouldn't be making any trades. Take a week or a month off and don't do any trades. You still have 20k and that's not nothing. Random yolos have like a 95% chance of expiring worthless.
can AMD come back to the party
Man this guy flips his free stock into 1k and he'd be a legend.
Okay Im just gonna say it, but dont you all go ruining it:

 NTLA fucking spanked yall and is up 100% since October. 

You want a cheaper CRSP? 

NTLA. 

You're welcome.
Jan or Feb CCL puts?
Pltr duhh buy the dip
yep.  and the biggest piece of shit airline when it comes to dealing with cattle...er, people (besides United).
bruh fuck it $SPY $400 2/19/21
Sounds safe. And no theta bleed.

Luck has nothing to do with it
This is pushing my limits of understanding, but yes. We are trading at almost care free levels right now.
Get out now, RH investors about to swoop in
I bought AC at around 14 and sold at 16 so a bit salty
27, retard
6 weeks is an eternity in this market.
definitely roll that if u intend on keeping, its not getting to 600 tmr imo
looking at the IV on my GME calls 😅  
NOT FUCKING SELLING
Pooh will be proud
optimism for vaccine approval in play - money was also stuck in tech for a while
Fuck you you paper handed pansy
Holy shit. I broke even 😭
LAZR 👌🏼
I’ve learned to always take a profit
Snort it if it hits 35 eow?
You wind down a position after huge gains to it only makes up a specific % of your portfolio. Standard practice.
CCL calls still worth it?

CCL just hit stage 2 of moonshot 🌝 🚀
I bought the 415 because it was super cheap. It was just something to buy even though i knew i wont get killed by decay. So its either a win win or just an expiry untill doe. Due to the vaccine news ,holidays approaching and etc anything can happen. But i get what you saying
Put or calls

(Don't ban)
Today's market is all about how investors see the world next year and beyond: Free from Covid (Airlines, restaurants, non-online retailers pump), where competition amongst the world powers creates a new AI and cybersecurity-driven arms race (CRWD, PLTR, SNOW pump), data becomes the new oil (DDOG, SUMO, ASANA pump), and thus EV's replacing gas guzzlers (TSLA) becomes a nail in the coffin for traditional automakers (GM), who are way too late to the electric party.

Today's bearish, but recovering trades (potential dip buying opportunities):  
\-Anything to do with China (BABA, BIDU, NIO).   
\-Any covid-tech play (ZM, PTON).
okay you fucking losers. I created a WSB ETF its called the 3 pee pees'  PLTR, PTON, and fucking PSTH. Buy these or you hate money.
Child’s play im down 90% some retards here are down 150%

Why did they go away just change in style or did they break reddit rules?
should have went all in on airlines yesterday
Simulus talks going well
When’s the expiry and strike?
Yikes dude you probably held on too long already so idk, it’s just straight up riverboat gambling at this point
Tesla stock too low imo. $600 eod
Boeing wtf, pulling a Snapchat
Gme calls 1 hour before close on Tuesday. Can you wait that long?

Listen to this man
Jets over
AMD and NVDA always linked by the ballsack
Feeling boomerish and thought about buying 100 DIS to write calls against.  Dat ATH, tho....
amzn plz pump bro jesus
You know what I see in this market in these "uncertain" times. The human bias for optimism, which sometimes borders on greed and foolishness.

But how else would have such clawless and hairless creature conquered the deserts and seas, to start in Africa and soon to colonize Mars. We had to be optimistic fools.

Bears are anti-humans, and fuk.
Hold
Fuck yeah!!
 do I sell my Jan 21st $25 calls at a 45% profit or wait for the moon?  I’ve sat on this for 5 months, ups and downs... but time is running out, but so much upside left.
remember what happened last time.?
It will take 6 days for shorts to cover. It won't be a one day deal

Time to buy calls

Fuck those with paper hands, anti trust news is not new

Can't cuck the zuck
Held through the morning dip the last two days, decided to finally sell my tesla and pltr this morning to buy back during the dip... they didn't dip.
You think being delisted from US markets will double the stock? 🧐
can someone eli5 why PLTR is such a meme?
yeah PLTR is catching a bid right now, I think the correction is over
I know how it works. It's just annoying. I actually bought this when it was OTM but as I've slowly been theta fucked, I'm ATM and still down. oh well. life goes on!

Saw LAZR in my account and did a double take :D Anyone else still holding?
Yesss already up 3k on 42.50 33c 12/24
the volume is not really there right now so I think this will be short lived

Still no one is paying attention to this. Blows my mind. So until it starts really hitting the news where autistic boomers are, I’m going to hold off on calls
thanks going to do the exact opposite of this
Yes exactly
I feel like the only guys you'll find on here like that are basically Martin Cabello
Fuck gme
Thanks for the confirmation basis, all in
I got GE stock and it’s now at $10+ and counting 😩
Delta on my calls is .724 so what does that mean? And is delta greater for far OTMs?
Hope so, my 16.5c is looking forward to it.
Thank you almighty Boeing🙏
Wasnt AAL literally the one with the biggest airline debt?
Nikola you’re just a walking dead at this point, just drop dead already bruhhhh
Most governments have asked for more data on it.  Might be the long term winner for the reasons you listed but right now it’s third with a pretty healthy gap between them and PFE / Moderna as far as primary vaccine provider.
I like ACB 12/18 because it has involvement in Mexico’s medical cannabis sector and Mexico may legalize on 12/15. But APHA has a more recognizable product in their drinks. 

I have positions on $11 for ACB and $9 for APHA on 12/18 hoping for a second weed pop.
Yes.

Autist bloodline. Make sure you pass it down the line
SABR tendies incoming. Great way to play the vaccine without going directly into airlines. Small buy in, big potential for gains.

fuck me CCL is gonna make me coom, up $500 from a call I bought when it was at $20 yesterday lmao
It’s typical of my luck that I opted to yolo in 🐝 over gmhi when they were both at 10.

Not at all, I just feel like this isn’t even a lotto ticket, if I was super bullish, I’d go for same expiration 390 strike calls, as a lotto. But I really have no clue what could be a catalyst for it.

RCL canceled yesterday and went up... makes no sense

That’s what I thought because it’s my understanding when Vix is a little higher a dip isn’t that big of a deal because there is already some hedging going on. When Vix is really low though that’s when you get huge pops on little news. Is this right?

What? Most of them are just rich kids and all the shit they learn at Universities are freely available globally. They go to Western Universities because it is superior to Chinese Universities, QoL is still leagues ahead in the US, their parents can afford it, and they place particular value on education. 

You want to know how they steal IP? By making any company that operates in China partner with a domestic company. This sub loves its fucking conspiracy theories when the truth is much simpler.

Scraps?
With Walgreens being one of the largest pharmacies in the nation, only exceeded by CVS in the number of storefronts it operates (yet with a lower per share investment), is now the time to invest in WBA stock? It seems as though the U.S. government and private citizens are going to be unloading truckloads of cash into Walgreens (and other pharmacies) as soon as a vaccine is released.

Lmao, like this??
It was great man, RIP
I'm less bullish on them then I was 6-12 months ago but we'll see. My bull would be with the money they have, they should be able to fix their issues. If worst came to worse they could just copy AMD and pump out more sales for a lower profit margin.

However @ the end of the day I believe Intel has more downside than upside potential. Even if they succeed i believe $60 a share again could take a hot minute. Once/if they hit it, idk if they'll have consistent growth in terms of their stock price & that's being optimistic. They have very strong financials, but still their stock is able to slide 10% based of competitors edge alone. Now imagine they lose a contract here, a contract there and their financials start to take a blow.

TL;DR

extremely lucky to see $70 a share in the next 2 years. Potential of it cutting in half if financials dip. Better places to park your cash.
Whats the catalyst?
I am not impatient, but nervous about the vote outcome.... sold some warrants today to reduce my exposure here.
I have the Tism for TSM
probably because recent announcement that we will be able to vaccinate 100million people by end of Feb.  That means this postponement of sail will probably be the last (as oppose to indefinitely before).

Confession time guys: 

now that airlines are doing well, I can confirm that I absolutely lucked into a lottery ticket in June and bought airline monthlies and weeklies 1 day before the massive pump on a whim because I just randomly thought they’d gone down for too long. 6000% return on my whole account in like 3 days.

Now for the good part: i held past June 8 and then chased airlines down the tube until mid July and lost all the return and more doing so. I refused to get into tech because I thought airlines were the way 🤡 

Thank god for the august Tech pump that brought me back to almost aths , but we still slowly climbing out that sept. Hole on that grind now 😤
I will buy pltr tomorrow after the  scheduled Friday slaughter. Big brain

CCL doing well today. My ATM Jan 22 leaps basically act like a 2x on the stock price. Price is up 10% today, I’m up 21%. If I had gone with OTM ones I would’ve paid a smaller premium so my return would be higher. I wonder if OTMs also move more in response to changes in the underlying, for example if they had been far OTM would it be 3x the change in stock price?
It’s not an American company. It’s a Switzerland company and their government supports it. Eventually so will USA. otherwise the scientist will just leave and go to the country’s that do support this thus missing out. That’s why DTIL and MBIO are low. But once the ISA recognizes it. It’s going to shoot up
Probally 24 or higher imo followed by smart shorts covering/exiting. Why pay debt early unless you know you'll have a positive earnings. I say we hit +.03 eps or higher. -.80 was setting the bar low. I know tons of people who went and got used games to save a few bucks and kill some quarantine time. Honestly though who knows what will happen. The hardest shorts are dug in there like a ton of ticks.

Others already addressed your points and every analyst that’s spoken since has said NIO is going up. They have major announcements in the near future and your reasons are based on things that aren’t happening how you described or haven’t actually been confirmed. 

Your last point, if it happens, will hit the entire market pretty equally. It would be a terrible idea to pull out of a good long-term stock because of a new tax. If you’re long NIO then you’re trading a new tax for a short term gains tax(which will probably hurt more).
Por que no los dos?
The explanation is easy. We are experiencing an EV bubble.

Options price is a combination of intrinsic value (based on stock price) and extrinsic value (based on volatility, time decay, etc). Since the stock has been flat for weeks on end implied volatility is low, therefore extrinsic value is low and options prices are therefore low.

Look at IV for meme stocks. PLTR was pushing IV of almost 300% for a while. That's why stocks can sometimes move 10-20% and options may trade flat or still lose money.

On a side note, 19% is pretty decent but probably average this year seeing how volatile market was during the pandemic, if you actually maintain 19% for 30 years you're somewhere around 3 million BUT Netherlands has an inflation of on an average, 2.5ish every year so if that continues then you technically have about a million and a quarter in your currency (if you're actually Dutch).

Ayy, I got that one too, held it till 9.
I might go in tomorrow
Thanks fude
I mean if you're talking about AAL they employ 130k+ people and provide a critical service.  It doesn't matter how bad their fundamentals are they're always getting bailed out by the govt no matter what.
Hahahaha ok dumb troll. I’m done wasting my time. Blocked.

anyone have the dates for previous CHWY earnings dates and how much the stock rose prior and after release?

AMD literally erased all of yesterdays gains and my calls are looking like nate robinson rn
This shit is depressing. I wish o could go back to a month ago before I did this shit.
A non selfish person would donate all their blood
Thank you.

I was clearly thinking of something different lamo
I guess depends on what you intend to trade. Personally, I don’t trade weeklies so I mainly use 1Y:1D as well as 3Y:1W. And occasionally I use 30D:30m to confirm the best time to get in/out. Tbh I find using more time frames just stresses me out so I just keep it simple with 3-4 indicators to confirm.
Where the fuck do you guys find these stocks? I always seem to be late to the party

Nice! Hope both of them hit. I have amazon at 3% of portfolio for the long run! YOLOOO
OMG YES TSLA GO GO GO
GME playing the TA by book right now. Like the astrology is self fulfilling.

And paying too much to put it in
You have enough battery life to do one last yolo on hertz .

I love that the main headline on CCL is that Carnival canceled more cruises for 2021 and the stock is up 9.2%.
Not as retarded as holding calls
PSA: If you bought CRM calls expiring 12/31, the theta on them is brutal at this point. Roll them out.
Don’t put your net worth into one play hoss

Just to be clear there never was no fiasco.
Lmao my CRSR calls are red on a 4% up day. IV better chill.
My tardey-sense is tingling, I sense a PM dip on NIO
It looks bullish because it’s probably going to do a quick run up into a hard sell like September.
If you sold to open then you buy to close.

If you sold a call to open then you buy the same strike/date to close.
That $200 was meant to be for experimentation, but not like this! I know it’s only $200 but still not nothing to me lol
My CCL gains are offsetting my GME losses lmfao

GameStop is closing about 100 more stores than it originally planned, with the struggling retailer warning of more closures next year.

The company said in Wednesday's earnings call that between 400 and 450 stores globally will close this year, which is more than the 320 stores GameStop originally said in March that it was planning to shutter. The increase underscores how badly retailers are performing during the pandemic as shoppers shift their habits online

To those of you who complain about being down when a stock is up 9% - have you not realized the big moves now happen AH and PM?

Keep an eye on what you like, and be aware that for the most part recently the big moves happen outside of 9:30-4.

Catch a few of those per week and you'll see why day-trading has been harder these past few weeks.

What?
Just a casual 250%-500% return 80% of the time. It’s easy 🙄
I like any meme that uses this song 🇯🇵🚘💨
Already starting it’s moon mission
Buying ITM spreads 1 day before expiry seems like free money. I guess until Tesla tanks and I lose 400 dollars trying to make 100
You'll get it with a nice 100%+ markup
I'm either poor or I'm smart enough to limit my YOLOs to money I won't care about losing.
Same, cash gang for now ftw. If dips to 20 might buy more who knows g2g
I just hit it big guys, I’m up 7.50 today
My HD and ICLN calls are doing poorly this week but next week I think I’m going to collect! Luckily I bought the nio dip this morning and next week I’ll collect on that bigly
Or buy a put that expires eow
Wtf is AAPL even doing like are you fucking drunk?
dont give people your advice. If the stock goes up, they take the credit. If stock goes down, you take all the blame. Its a lose lose situation
fundamentals are not a good tool for analyzing growth stocks

if you're trying to do value investing, buying some beat down boomer stock, they're important

if you think you've identified the next big thing then the future is what you're betting on, and we don't have any data about the future

Means that seasonality favors a slow grind higher. Neither Washington or the Fed will want to risk upsetting the apple cart until 2021.  


The problem with these grind higher moves is that when there *is* a legit sell off it will be larger than average (which is currently being reflected via an advancing VIX).
But how much fun was it to not be a pussy

It's out there.  Somewhere.
AAL is gonna dip today. Just threw 2k on some puts that expire tomorrow. It’s either gonna make me lose 2k or it’s gonna make me bands. Ez
with you.. took profits from ccl and pushed into spy pootz.
It will hit 40$
Why are calls on Apple so cheap and why is the IV so low, is it really that unlikely it will pop?
I’d welcome a nice dip but honestly the charts and volume look pretty bullish. Kinda contrasting with DIX and fear/greed. I’m not a TA nerd tho
They just cured SIV, the equivalent version of HIV in monkeys
Taking profits and losing out on potentially more gains always hurts less than just straight up losing all your gains. Always take some profits, unless you are confident or retarded enough to not care
Imagine if they gave us a 5-10% pull back in the next 2 weeks so everyone knows to buy the dip and it powers us through spy 400

Sold the out and wouldn’t mind getting assigned at 23. I’d just sell covered calls again the next week
I thought GME was about some shorting situation, what's it called? Short ratio float ratio percentage something or other?

Yeah, it's mind-blowing. Especially with the virus currently at all time highs, American jobless claims, and RCL's lack of cashflow.

the retard who made a post saying he converted $11 into a few thousand mentioned in one of the comments that he was gonna get a $295c 12/31 call on BA so i said screw it and bought a 300c yesterday and lo and behold, the retard was right. I paper handed it and sold for a 200% profit but that's pretty insane

PLTR is working just fine. Promote your own ticker but don't downgrade other's, so they will invest in your own.
So true.
It was priced in after the election when it was assumed the repubs were 100% holding the senate.  They still going up with a red senate just not as fast.

You have dumped your life savings and loans into GME. You're sitting on 1,000 shares.

OP. How poor are you?
That's one daytrade.
Alright you sluts. Let's keep the action up on CCL, but sell off SPY. Make me right on both my plays today so I can end the day with a smile on my face. If Jerome Powell can start talking about raising interest rates because the stock market is doing so well and because the vaccine is on the horizon, that would be fucking amazing.
well at least you are open to listening bro, good for you. I don't need to DM, it's simple and public info.

Summary, stick to 70-80% shares/ETFs, the rest on Options and only 5-10% OTM and at least 6 months out. The problem ofc is that you may not have that much capital to start with to buy near OTM-calls on these cos. Then it's a change your mentality thing- you just need to walk away from the allure of options temporarily. Go big on shares, choose the riskiest of ETFs like leveraged TQQQ and SOXL and play all the meme stocks on WSB you like but only shares for a few months until you have enough capital for say 1-2 options. Keep buying shares, and then maybe when you have enough set side buy another call. Rinse and repeat.

the game is slow my friend, but the good thing is that you have enough time to become really really rich if you just have the patience. gl

Can we get it too or is it limited to those bigger companies?
Puts on snow pretty cheap rn IMO
Well congrats and fuck you
Bears tiptoeing around the trap wondering whether to risk not buying into PLTR for another day and it soaring another 22%
unlikely until actual news about a merger comes out. I'll be flat until then. Could be weeks, could be months.
Yes, make sure to buy on days where it is already up 10% so we can get some more loss porn up in here
Hello hello hello docu calls or puts?

Me? I'm not a victim. But I agree that you are unable to provide specifics, as I have repeatedly asked.
Cause they wants u to get rich
Imagine pledging donations to charity contingent upon you making tendies on a specific trade.

It’s like you are negotiating with a greater power, “If you want me to help the unfortunate this holiday, give me some tendies”
Those numbers are in Euros so if you did the math they come out about the same

Hah thats awesome:) brrr
No choice. Don’t do weeklies kids
I bought two shares so time to check out Rolex fall line
Say I buy 1 call and then another of the same call in a different order. If I sell both same day is that considered 1 or 2 round trips?

Last earnings I threw in some FD's and went like 300% after market open post-earnings

This time I was too chicken shit and just sat on the side and watched :(
Show me ur portfolio sperg
Yeah I know, but some people may be concerned about it and see an extension as doubt that it will happen. It shouldn’t be viewed like that - just offering reassurance to people reading.
Would invest in Sony before I invest into GameStop lol. You’re investment is equivalent to investing into RadioShack rather than in tech.
Without going back and looking I remember it was bigly green but then got kinda rocky until people saw what stimulus could do in April then it was an elevator back to spy ATH with only the brief dip in June (which totally nuked my portfolio of 100% airlines and airline weeklies btw)
Good then you won’t 🧻🤚 your gme shares until takeoff happens if you choose to join on this insane ride
i see that volatility happening soon - but rolled my calls from this week to next week - 370c 12/11

No Passenger cruises equals higher share price... Who knew?
The 52 week low was $2.57, which is the lowest it's ever traded in its history since 2003. You didn't get in at $1.56.

Pretty mad I sold my leaps in for only 75% gain when the price was at like 18 a share
Come on PLTR drill into these bulls asses please
Back into CRSR I go. Time to sail the high sees.
Interesting story on Planet Money today about this very topic.  [https://www.npr.org/2020/12/02/941716442/before-the-shot-in-the-arm](https://www.npr.org/2020/12/02/941716442/before-the-shot-in-the-arm)Boron mining may be an opportunity given it is a key element of Borosilicate glass.     Based on the planet money story, i get the impression there are only a few companies that make this stuff and likely that opportunity has already been missed from an investment perspective.  I got to wonder if the next piece of the supply chain opportunity here is the recycling of the billions of vaccine vials made of borosilicate glass that will soon abound
this thread and this sub was way more about posting their positions. in fact if you didn't post positions you got trolled about getting banned - smdh wsb where you at?

How embarassing
Yes. Someone thinks the stock will go up.
I’m with merril and they only allow a handful of etfs. Does anyone know a way around this without straight up quitting my job to roll over to an ira?
I hear you, and that's a fair concern. But that's on the YTD timeline, and the direction of MACD can change based on price during the next few days. And if it does cross, price might just not drop very far. Price still sitting well above 200EMA YTD. And how many time frames should you pay attention to at one time? If one out of seven shows bearish MACD crossover, are you supposed to sell? This is shit I don't know. All time MACD still growing.
Someone selling puts 12/31 $49, means they think it’s going to rocket
Make sure to update us once the drop comes
Ban. Just use your karma to pay for rent this month, duh.

Grain of salt here... but I remember about a year ago someone, claiming to be Chinese in a Reddit comment, said that they’re taught to cheat because if you’re not then you’re not playing on the same level as others.
Hey, you goddamn autistic geniuses. This is your first and last warning to get in $LAZR before eminent memeage. Don't fight the future. Pew pew
Nope, it's in my Roth
I realized yesterday that I could just use a bunch of my margin to buy ARKG which is ark invest’s genomic ETF. This year it got a 144% return, so I’m just gonna let my margin sit in that account until I need it for something else. Their number one holding is CRSP.

The House of Representatives on Wednesday unanimously passed a bill that sets the stage for delisting Chinese companies on U.S. exchanges, including electric-vehicle makers such as XPeng , and Li Auto .

So I read the article looks like nio is compliant with the auditing that will take place. I’m Holding

After 5 years, I am finally back in the green. By 1%
Be pretty cool if they gave PSTH a shot at 30, see if it can hang with the other MEMEs
Mr market I don’t feel so good
So why are cruises up 8%?
Sell that shit now at a loss and buy puts to make up for it then sell those puts when you made your loss back. Don’t get greedy just make your money back and gtfo of options on stocks with huge run ups like Nio. Get some MSFT 12/11 215c instead of the NIO puts if you want, and WMT 12/24 150c
Eating tendies as a pastime activity.....
Gme cratering
My time machine is rkt. Rode that shit I’m to 30 and held like a retard and got burned. Not happening again lol sold pltr at 33.10
123.
Your mistake wasn't playing these stocks, your mistake was playing with options. GME was and still is a stock play. Unless you're buying calls expiring wayy out. If you played weeklies this is on you lol
That's true.  WSB seems to be good at finding bubbles and making them pop

Slow and steady daily swings of 10% 😂
Season starts this month right?
Pltr 30c 12/4
Why would u say such a thing? Do.not.think. ATH all the time...forever. What could go wrong? Truly, the early tape action Monday & Wednesday this week. They will never ever let this thing go anywhere else but straight up. The shorts tested both days & didn’t just fail. ..They got fukin annihilated as a message to never ever try it again. Bonkers! & barely legal, to boot.
[deleted]
I’m taking it as serious considering my whole account is in it
Let's post this gif in sino and see what happens
Lol sell it for a small loss before that contract tanks and you lose it all
Probally. Shorts are desperate to keep this sub 15.80. I see sub 15.80 on Tuesday. Then we get a surprise curveball on earnings.
I’m just not one to spout tickers. Rather give general advice. I know what I can afford to risk and lose, I don’t know what you can. It makes our plays vastly different.
PLTR gang, checking in. We still alive
If you wanna trade options for that chance of hitting it big then fair enough but can people stop acting like a few % up or down is either crashing or mooning just because you leveraged yourself into the ground
You’ll be back
Why would it be? Anyone can give price targets. Its up to the market to decide to listen to them or not
i would wait for tomorrow honestly i think when we get to 370 we see a pullback
Could also be a hedge
Laggy as hell, one minute I'm up 50% then I'm down 25%
On balance volume crossover for the 1st time today. Buy TSLA here.

They are selling Puts FYI,they are bullish
Hit me with a solid day trade please
A broken straddle play is not a yolo, bye
Any predictions for AAPL EOW?

I picture a bunch of guys standing at a control board with a big knob labeled PLTR going "No wait...watch I'm gonna turn it up a bit and then...BAM..turn it back down again" while laughing their asses off
LETS GO DOCU CHANNNNN
You know those call options with like the few dollar strike prices? Could we all collective buy those as a sacrificial option to raise the stock price? Of course we would loose the few dollars but the calls below them will surely benefit and make up for the few dollar loss .
Look up what open interest means bro

I'm pretty sure APR needs to take into account the actual annual cost, meaning it is calculated assuming no payments are made, and all interest is compounded through the end of the year.  Frequent compounding increases the APR.

I don't work on the side of banking that needs to give a shit about this, though.

The real market cap shouldn’t be $1.5bn. That’s the pro forma enterprise value of the company. Enterprise value doesn’t equal market cap (aka equity value).

Enterprise value = equity value + debt - cash

Also, the deal is for 20% of the company. This isn’t to say I’m not interested because ARK invested in it. Just wanted to clarify some things for the community.

I can’t even sell calls because I’m a eurocuck. Literally can only baghold.
NIO looks ready for another major dip. Please change my mind so I keep paper handing these calls
They reconvene at 12 apparently to begin discussion of the MORE act, I assume they vote after but who the hell knows. Been watching reps talk all morning and half of them are retarded. The even put a little R next to the retarded ones so you can ID quicker.
If you want to make money just do the opposite of what WSB is pumping insanely and you will win.
What's it gonna take Tesla to break 600? Feel like we pinned to around 580

I bought like 10 shares at $50 a couple months ago and they’re up like 53%, never expected that
how far out?
There is no risk of losing any more than that $200 though, right?
this market needs a therapist like no other
Sheesh that 1 year looking like kingda ka
Naw do a monthly call.
Real stocks frozen

Sounds like you need to start a YouTube channel
That's 87% increase. Are you that confident in it or is this a bluff?
The vote/meeting started at 10. Should be soon. Im guessing they are writing a press release now about it.
I know the bottom is 10$ per share. So I dont care but my money is stuck with the stock that barely keeps its gain. So missing out on oppurtunities else where.
41 here. I hold though and sell 55$ calls until I get assigned.
Lol - you can sell it back, at loss or gain, depending on the size of your retarded balls.

For reals though, just hold your shares, GME has around 1 billion cash and only about 470ish million debt, that's a 2:1 cash to debt ratio (that's good numbers)   


Either this December or next March, the squeeze will squoze or squotheth or squethen depending on where you fall on the spectrum, and we will be riding lambos around Tendie Town

Well said!
PLTR slow and steady to the moon 🚀
But yesterday it was tomorrow also...
Exactly. Options are so volatile in the first 30 minutes you can sell for way higher than later. Options are cheapest like 1 hour before close.
It would have went down if I bought shares or calls. Just doing the lords work.
DOCU drop off EOD before earnings?
If you’re not the retardest person in the room you’re in the wrong room.
Interesting chart. Did they miss earnings or something?
Solid DD
This be controversial but.... what if you didn't do that?
I need Corsair to hit $40 to break even.

Offf. Hope that was play money for you
No more cash, no more problems 😎
Wait til you put coffee creamer in the shower. Massive retardation required to pull that one off.
I have Jan 2023 30C on CCL that are up big today. Do I lock in those gains, pull out, and go back in later cheaper? Or do I just let it ride?
Unlikely until we get news

You get a few lucky hits in the market and people think you’re a guru. Some dude just offered to pay me to advise him on his portfolio.  I would be pretty much just handing it over to you guys lmao.
I feel this completely. I used to get emotional with minor swings, and downright suicidal if I held till worthless. Numbness to ups and downs is key to making $$
This is the way
Right now, I'm so glad I only deal in stocks.
I’m so bored
No bro this is precisely the time to sell covereds. When the market is absolutely flying with no fear like it was a month ago, then you buy raw dog calls. Now after a month rip and no dip, somethings on the horizon looking at the indicators, hedge risk with coverds

Edit I’m retarded for thinking you said buy covereds but you’re retarded for selling covereds lmao
im with you so far
Lol Truck go down hill
What time is the vote?

thats horrible advice for this stock - there is a lot of gay bears with big money actively trying to supress this stock.... If you have a stop loss - they are likely to push it down, trigger your stop and then within a hour or so after you are out of the game you can watch the bulls push this right back up and you can kiss your tendies good by.

Better to lose 50% on a bet than a divorce. Also, I have 50% of my wife’s IRA currently in a $PSTH yolo (stocks only). Lol
Maybe it has something to do with the new exchange they will be listed in when they are de-listed from American markets?
Me too, I picked JD because BABA tends to cuck quite frequently. Chart is way more choppy, BUT for a shorter term trade I would go with BABA
and one that will continue to be told forever
Good luck

lol people still trade this? Stupid fuckin stock, company run by tards
whatever.  this is the best you can offer?
So Friday of last week I bought 600 in PLTR calls due to reddit.  Monday market opens and I'm in the green for a few minutes and then boom it nosedives.  I held until Tuesday and finally said fuck it, sold the call for 200 and bought puts.  Puts go the fuck off and I get 1200 back.  I sold yesterday and then waited until I felt it was going back down and bought more puts.  Got fucked today and sold those puts for 600 and bought more calls only this time expiring at end of January instead of end of week.  So hopefully it can just gain without any research groups giving it shit.
PLTR has peaked, downhill from here tbh
Ew they won’t let you take the losing clan tag off ??

RSI don’t lie
I need to stop selling CC's when market is keep going up like this..
Hong Kong, the territory that technically belongs to them (previously under british administration, and then Hong Kong admin), the one that's connected by land, the one that's resisting, caused riots, damaged Xi's reputation among the Chinese elite, and that garnered international attention? That Hong Kong? If taking one city that they technically have the rights to, then taking something like Vietnam or Taiwan, a fucking island, is going to be much, much harder.

Tibet is a remote autonomous region that they've laid claim to for years, and that is also a part of China in most maps, and it has very, very little influence, power, resources, or infrastructure, AND THEY STILL couldn't just take it. It has taken years, and their actions their have also drawn international attention. I'm done, this is just stupid. You don't have a mind for this.
I've found that the key to options trading is reaching a point where you have no emotional reaction whatsoever to the numbers on the screen. Most people don't last long enough to reach this point.

You want to reach a point where you can earn $50k in a day without getting happy. Then you can finally approach things with a clear and rational mind. And make a lot of fucking money.
Thinking about it, whats your play?
In the same position. Not sure what to do with it this guy won’t budge 😒
They gave me CPRX and I bought 1300 dollars of shares at $3.00 and sold around 5. WeBull gave me Levi and I sold it for 12 :(

As someone who knows nothing about BA, those 250s are safe... probably.
what your play if you get loan?

2021 is a new tax year

Yeah so your lotto tickets print. Like there’s any skill involved. Theta gang will wipe their ass w you 9/10 times. Guy gets 1 lucky options contract thinks he discovered electricity. Go eat a cock.

Edit: wow look at these downvotes. Like I give a flying fuck 🤣 Downvote my dick in your mouth. I’m long all my positions. I’m not a gambler. Options traders are fucking retards especially on wsb. I see new people here every 2 months. I wonder why 🤮Come at lick my balls

BEUH I SHOWERED WHAR HAPPENED TO SPY LMDAOO
Which ever one of you retards mentioned riot yesterday .  Thank you guy !!
Sell at 40.10????? Ban
Yes
It is. Greedy idiots will tell you not to sell a single share under $500, but that's absurd. What happens if it moons to $499.97 and your sells are all at $500? I'm set up to start selling in tranches of 10% of total at $8-10 increments once it hits 2x my average price. I'll definitely make less than I could, but I'll take an higher chance of an incredible profit over a lower chance of an insane profit any day.
Which means there’s a chance it could hit 21 next year if all goes well 👀👀
Berserk soundtrack. Nice.
God I love GME! I'm loaded up on shares with $1.56 cost basis, BTFD since september. It literally can't go tits up now. Best company ever
Short snow!!!!!
This next hr should go up
Does anyone here have money I can borrow?😞😞😞😞
Us AMERIPOORS are fucking pathetic.  Sell at open every day since March or lose your ass.  MM's pump random stocks and sell/pin everything else to fuck options holders. 

Buy before close, sell at open is easily the best strategy.
Well no shit my guy... if you look at any index you can see being a permabear is retarded. But the reason id rather play with euro stocks is because i think the u.s economy shouldnt be at ATH with the multitude of red flags goin off.
I hope your calls expire worthless you spamming asshole
I love mcdonalds
What broker are you using?

What do you recommend?
Yeah I was wondering what would cause me to get out of my position, and to me this is a big factor. His presence and vision for the company should be a huge tailwind so long as he’s invested and pushing. If he sells, I’m definitely scaling down my position.
Been buying dips but I expect even bigger dips in short to midterm which is why I didn’t buy super heavy.
Thanks Cathie Woods

Look at JD too.

Barely any fucking dips to buy up and it just keeps running higher and higher. Usually outperforms BABA except for today

BABA has more room to climb in the short term tho, I would be confident in BABA $290c for a month or more out. JD is good to $90 and after that I am not sure in the near term
He lacks critical information lol

Did you get a whole share?
Copying this for you bc you said teslas aren’t affordable :
> When the cost to travel, around town or even short leg flight equivalents (think St. Louis to chicago) is a couple pennies per mile bc of full self driving you will be able to say the same thing, “Tesla products are used by most people and very marketable”
> What’s easier? Getting the kids up, get to the airport an hour early, sit on a plane for 40 minutes, get your bag, call an Uber, wait and sit in Uber for 20 minutes to get from airport to hotel? Or Have a full self driving Tesla cyber truck pull up to the house, throw your bags and children in it and let it drive you, and get you from door to door in less time than the air would have taken, for half the cost? (And This doesn’t even factor in the massive amount of leg room and comfort of a truck vs a plane seat.)

OP is basically betting that PSTH will announce their acquisition target in the next week or two. Why would you try to time that?  There is no other catalyst to cause upward stock movement, since as it currently stands PSTH has no identity, it’s just a blind pool of money with Ackmans name attached to it. He could be lucky and make bank, but that’s just dumb luck. The probability of them announcing a strong target sometime in the future is actually pretty high IMO, the probability of them announcing that in the next two weeks is very low IMO. So why wouldn’t you buy warrants or stock?
I suck today
I'm holding some further out calls for that very gamble
And now I’m negative hahah
should i drop CRM calls for WFC?

Yeah I bet. Thanks for giving me a heads up about Airbnb. I think I will yolo into it and try make my money back. Or at least some of it. Day trading makes me shit myself every 5 mins.

Maybe you got DD or Airbnb or just buy anything below 50?
Buy
Yea I get that but this could have just opened at 3180 and then you’re fucked. Get what I’m saying? I mean it’s been working but you have to make the trade 2.5 times to make money if you get one wrong

Sold half of mine yesterday at 16.50, bought them back at 16.05
This week has crushed my trading account. Vaccine rotation has just decimated my tech monthlies. Might have to go leaps but even then I’m hesitant. Bubble pop? 🤷🏻‍♂️
Thanks! The worst performing one was +1.1% at open. They’ve gone down the entire time since open 👌🏼
I’m in bed and have school in 20 min. No clue just day trading, seems like 240 was resistance with temporary break to 241.50. Predicting at least 235 today

You need to evaluate how easily China can do things, like just taking Vietnam. If all the countries around China cooperate in trade and copyright law, it'll be easier to provide a unified front, where countries around China prevent it from infringing intellectual property. This trust and these relationships need to be built up over time. China wants influence over these territories regardless, if they could just take it the way you just described they would have.

I hear a lot of people talk like this, broad strokes of dismissiveness. "X will just Y", as if that was all the nuance international diplomacy had. There's so, so much more to it than that.

And again, who the hell said the TPP is working for them? China. Is. Not. In. It. Look up the signees, China's not on the list.

Too many bullish retards buying calls forcing mms to buy stock. The real blood bath is the sell the news day when millennial makes have to get a job again / can go to bars. No more FD buyers, no more mm buy hedges, and then bloodbath.
yeah, it's really unlikely to happen pre-earnings, after that it all depends on earnings and RC
we knew from the start is was gonna take a while. Could be months. Nobody knows but its coming is all that matters

higher volume in the morning so it goes up, but it will usually flow back down. Also just from the past couple days it has been going down and down, and it broke through the 22.5 threshold a lot of autists were citing

When the cost to travel, around town or even short leg flight equivalents (think St. Louis to chicago) is a couple pennies per mile bc of full self driving you will be able to say the same thing, “Tesla products are used by most people and very marketable”

What’s easier? Getting the kids up, get to the airport an hour early, sit on a plane for 40 minutes, get your bag, call an Uber, wait and sit in Uber for 20 minutes to get from airport to hotel? 
Or
Have a full self driving Tesla cyber truck pull up to the house, throw your bags and children in it and let it drive you, and get you from door to door in less time than the air would have taken, for half the cost? (And This doesn’t even factor in the massive amount of leg room and comfort of a truck vs a plane seat.)

I can’t give exact info, but if NIO says so, it means they have already talked to the top guys in the CCP. They didn’t change auditors and accounting practices for the past few months. The preparation they did was political. ;)
i can’t unsee it now
You don’t know when the peak is retard
Which would only help the economy...
I'd give some advice but OP is  too much of a degenerate and set on gambling with short-term OTM calls. he just needs to lose close to everything, gain some back and then lose it again and again until he learns his lesson. good news is that he's only 19 lol

Thank you
just to be clear, you've got nothing to say about the fact that the executive enforces statutory law, right? Its okay to admit you learned something.

And yes, if accounting practices don't result in massive over-valuation of Chinese companies, then 3 years with a friendly administration is plenty of time to work around the state secret law. 

Neither side has an incentive for de-listing. China bashing (and vice versa) is popular, following through is not.

Royal Caribbean is far from a shit company. It just happens to be that we are in the midst of a global pandemic, and going on a cruise is no one's idea of a vacation at the moment. No one wants to get trapped on a ship. That doesn't make RCL a shit company. Furthermore, with vaccines finally coming into play, the cruise & airline industries will recover. 

With that being said, I'm gonna stay far away from cruise & airline stocks as there are currently much better plays I could be in.

Thanks for the clear and precise explanation. So whats the play here? I'm more of a "safe" investor so I prefer leaps. Do you think $25c Jan 2022 leaps are a good play?

I bought long calls on AMD when it dipped into the 70s because I thought it was undervalued. 

I bought PLTR stocks at $18 because I thought it would continue running, but I didn't want options in case it just tanked. I've since sold most of my position but am actually keeping some to hold long term.

Guys, I’ve been holding AAPL for one day and it’s slow as a 🐢
Thanks for having it. I got Groupon, sucker got reverse spilt and my only one stock got vanished somewhere. I don't even know they gave me cash deposit for that or not.
I'm the only person I know who actually got APPL.
But I already did that 2 days ago

I sold my puts yesterday.
NNOX demo in 10 minutes, if the tech is legit this will be a triple digit stock next week. If not, will be sub 30. Straddles are a great play.
Ryan Cohen is a mf'ing smart & impressive dude. His endorsement/interest in GME probably swings it more than anything else for me.

Damn I really fumbled the bag on my AMZN put. Bought while it was falling. Was up $600 and didn’t sell. Now I’m even, hoping it goes back down. Fuck

Should he an auto ban
Something that makes you feel alive watching your account go up 10% and immediately drop -20% and then back up 5%
Ban
It wasn’t the first time. And if I’m perfectly honest it probably won’t be the last time.
I bought BA puts at the top
In hindsight, CRSP leaps was the play this whole time. Up 160% on my pathetic 8 shares.
Yes
Or you can sell the right to buy to someone else who does have the money.
Imagine Xbox or Playstation setting aside their service in favor of GME.

That's up 8%. Which is a huge move. Judging by share price is a bad idea.
lol well for this market any red candle is extremely rare - flash crashes/dumps are a thing of the past my friend. We will never see another stock market dip in our lifetime with the Fed and Yellen behind our backs supporting us
exit, gotta know when to cut your losses and profits. entering low is important but if you don’t know when to exit that’s when you go broke

You bet we did!!!

I turned my -$45k loss into a $8k gain today. 

Cashed my calls out at $1.42, after buying them 2 days earlier for $0.81. 

Can't beat that.
Part of me wants to say: i made that last week in an hour in PLTR. However he's the one that's going to come out on top because i lost 7k in an hour this week with PLTR.

I write puts so people pay me to take their shares during a bottoming of sentiment, you know? Then I expect to write covered calls and profit through income and appreciation over time. 

You should be writing 95 covered calls on days when RKT is showing toppish behavior, then buy back when the inevitable pullback happens.

PLTR 24c 12/11 sound good?
Bought some cheap AAPL 12/18Cs
That dip was rotation out of qqq into spy
I Don't think there will be much selling when they have a 1B buyback in the mix.

Also, tenured employees got 90k worth of stock @ $18 per share that doesn't fully vest until August 2023 - they have 20,000 employees. We are talking around 1 billion dollars worth of shares that will be held until 2023.

Throw the massive amount of shorts covering their position and $1B dollar buy back in the mix and you can see what I am trying to illustrate. It may not happen but if the starts align this will moon.
ZS 170p actually started to print a little.
I get drunk and buy stuff sometimes....it appears I'm full autist still.
Best index to play now is $DIA. Year end rotation from overbought $QQQ and $SPY.
There is no such thing as the top with LULU. What’s the expiry?
Imagine thinking Amazon could only sell books

Imagine thinking Netflix could only send DVDs in the mail
Lol I’m out, it’s a ticking time bomb right now
very

Nice, see you tomorrow
ban... krupt
Do we get the gay wizard PLTR meme today
Good now DoorDash us some Wendys
He’s just fear mongering to try to get the republicans to allow them to print more money
I did cash my PFE 1/15/21 40c's for a 320% gain. Still have a couple other PFE calls that can still pay off bigly.

IV is 130 for PLTR 12/11

TG, you know what to do
>History and economics also tell me that england, france, rome, greece, baghdad caliphate, and mongolian empire were also global hegemonies for god knows how many years.

Hegemony isn't the only factor. USA was and still is, even if to a lesser extent than before, at the forefront of technological advances and it's pop culture (for better or worse) is still the most widespread. It's also the richest nation (yes I'm aware of wealth inequality, but that's not the point). It's also one of the most powerful geopolitically speaking.  It's a pretty unique thing and understandably some people are proud of it. Rome is the only real contender on a similar front.

Overinflated confidence in America? Sure, it's common. But unfounded is also pretty disingenuous and usually comes from salty europeons or kiwis.
52wk high is >76. That can happen again
Fuuuck if only there were puts for this
Go to r/investing bro
dollar bottomed at 90.5 as I said it would and now it's time for the market to stop being constipated and let out that big shit it's been holding in for 2 weeks
Sold them today for $1.42.
Yeah Lidar is gonna be big not only in cars but in smartphones and even AR glasses. And if this can get meme stock status that would be great

Lmao wtf
I've uploaded the Morgan Stanley report to google drive if anyone wants to see it - https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Hcmb_0oAsr1ZyGHVy841zkjdtsZjVpQj/view?usp=sharing.  There are some legitimate concerns regarding integrating Foundry into the existing enterprise technology stack.  It references how they only have 132 customers and were founded in 2008, with each customer paying roughly $8 million per year.  It is an end-to-end turnkey solution, while most enterprises integrate "best of breed" technologies.
Any good plays today? they all look like shit
LIDAR?

 I can explain to fellow retards, basically Tesla uses cameras and ML to generate their computer vision for self driving. 

LIDAR is a bunch of fucking lasers that pulse out and instantly make a 3d map of the terrain. 

For the extra short bus WSB members: thats like that specialist grenade in COD u throw out and it maps the area in red lasers n shit brr brr. 

Elon has been quoted before saying LIDAR sucks because it is too expensive. 

This is where Luminar LIDAR will shine because it is inexpensive, affordable for carmakers, and will already be rolling out in 2022 VW cars and som Daimler mercedes shit too they got contracts already. 

Just buy some and forget, ur future self wont regret when WSB retards pump this as a meme stock.

Haven’t had a green day in two weeks 🤡

I mean it was up 12.5% - so from where I bought my puts - it’s down 4% - are you new to this?  I’m trying to help you.
Why would it?
Tempted to sell mine and take profits?
Go ask this [dude](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k5vaj4/_/gehvxm6/?context=1). He told me and I told you

Hold. Vaccine news keep coming out, that will pump airlines for sure, and in 1-2 weeks when cases coming down, that will add to the fuel
It seems like you spend a lot of time researching. The dd on this play was on point. It’s hard for me to find the time for due diligence as I am also trying to build a construction business etc. 

I’ve found it really hard to make money in the market. I got into trading in April. I double my money in June but lost it all almost as quick on the reit/mortgage pump and dump. I’m down 4K+ on the year 😔. I’m really amazed at times at how thoroughly the algos are designed in order to empty my account 🤣. I guess I just haven’t developed the patience needed yet...
if pltr was at $69 a share its market cap would be just over $100billion so i think we know where this is going
They didnt cook the books = they are compliant? Cool good luck. Cant help you if you dont know how to read
I am totally not having a good time anymore 😞

GME dip of destiny, buy that shit homies
🐝
Myth 3 is not a myth because because the executive is responsible for the enforcement of statutory law. Biden admin will opt-out or opt-soft bc history with protectionism and trade. Some big words there so I'm assuming you'll ignore them again.

Myth 6. Okay. They didn't cook the books. Making them compliant. Providing 3 years to figure out a way around the state secret law. What you said here invalidates the argument that this will have any affect on chinese stocks.

Clearly you also know fuck-all about geopolitics and civics like the OP.
LMAOOOO wtf is happening
On sale today this will 🚀for holiday season
Hold; don't bet against the boomers right now
Don't let the shorts win....grab up some GME!

GME ded wtf
You're welcome.
CRSR is the professor that takes his sweet ass time to give the results
And you idiots downvoted me for calling bull trap 30 minutes ago. Inverse WSB never fails
Holy Christ BA what’s the deal with that?
That ain’t corn of the popped variety
The last refuge of a conspiracy theorist, "just open your eyes" without providing proof. I agree that the CPP needs to be contained, but I'm saying the TPP was designed to be exactly that and you're saying it somehow does the opposite. Convince me. Convince me with facts. Don't just say you're choosing to see the truth, what truth? You've provided no evidence.
This is buy the dip day you idiots so the big fucks can get in before the stimi news
Is it though?
Fuckin OOF im doubling down on my fb spreads
Look, you probably bought pltr on friday last week.  You saw i was making mad tenders on aapl and now you bought aapl options today.  Its gonna be ok.  Youre a step behind but hold on! Unless you have fds you might be fucked.
Both
It's a bastion of financial stability.  Better to park free cash in NKLA than gold.
Lol I'm in danger
Felt the trading urge and just jumped in with some new positions. 

JMIA January 30c. Offering price was above $30, so that’s the floor for now it looks like. Could see a nice squeeze to $50 this month. CNBC and boomers love this stock for some reason. “AMaZoN oF AfRiCa!” Whatever, low cap right now and I’ll ride it up with the boomers. Room to run further here I think. 

AMD January 95c. Selling pressure last two days, but good prospects on the horizon. Lots of OI at $100c. Stock has been stagnant for a while, but let’s make it a WSB meme again like the good ol days.

PLUG March 25c. Green energy coming back after January. Look at the 6 month chart on this thing. Nice consolidation at this level. Could see a run to $35+.
ruh roh
if it doesnt go down, youre doing it wrong
Dip, baby, dip
That’s a SEC rule, not a rh rule.
Still down over 90% but we working it out
there will be a rug pool w/ SNOW just you watch

It had 4 Green Day’s in a roll...?
[deleted]
When there is a high short interest in a stock (meaning a large percentage of the trading volume is people selling the stock short) this disrupts the balance between buyers and sellers.  A stock’s price is determined by supply (selling) and demand (buying). More sellers mean there is more supply than demand.  When supply outgrows demand, prices drop.

EDIT: this is how the $1B buyback will fuck the shorts
Jon Snow is a Targaryen. What does that mean? Absolutely nothing.

Jim Cramer is actually a legend. He deserves some kind of monument on the NYSE building like a gargoyle
Just sold at plus 8 after buying back after the 11 percent jump. I respect you because youre a bear and i am at heart with this market as well. Hope you did as good as me today my guy📈
Any news to cause SPY to take a jump off the cliff?
DXCM $100 below its avg price target, get in on this dip!
Hold !!! It bouncing off 30k buy the dip
I'll stand by it. The majority of clients don't need to broadcast at all. They can have WIFI or other radios instead if the service needs telemetry. Broadcasting back to a GPS satellite, for the average mobile device, is retarded. And we already have two way higher precision GPS for military shit since most stuff doesn't need it.

When you feel on the edge of something bad, it's usually good idea to take a step back.
Good job
What volume do you have on each?
Basically I have covered calls expiring next friday with a 23 strike price. If I close now I’m breakeven. If I wait till next friday that’s 13K gain. Not sure if I should hold or if it’s super risky

I’m a little scared to know where you got that after reading your flair
Finally dump spy you fuck I want to recoup all my losses I gave you
If I took all the money I've lost on amzn options and just bought shares, I'd be sitting pretty.  But a strike like that is easy to hit on just one good day.  Tough call.
PFE about to be FDA approved, and it dips. The market is stupid.

I forgot NKLA was a real, profitable company.
Damn what happened? Lol
Name checks out
1) Apple simplified the usability...yes. And I'm not saying that isn't an factor of appeal...I'm saying it's not THE factor of appeal. People can buy shirts from walmart for $5 but they STILL buy Polo shirts that cost $55. It's the status and branding...which Apple has carved out for itself much like Tesla.

2) I mean the Iphone X was what...$1000? You can get a Pixel 2-3 at the time for a 1/3, 1/2 the price. Why did people stand outside in line for this device...?

3) Again, shit isn't cheap, sure, but people have this knack to associate status and quality with higher prices. The average person can buy a computer loaded with Ubuntu, for free, or Windows, with a laptop running like $400-500 at walmart, but STILL buy Macs, or whatever models are out there, for hundreds and thousands? OS works I'm told, I'm not a regular user, but you can do the EXACT same shit on Windows and Linux.

4) No...they are not reaching the level of status as Tesla. 

&#x200B;

The point I'm making is branding trumps the other factors involved with success. Period. People loyal to brands are like cult members.
you are a savant
....so what broker do you use? I absolutely believe this will happen
Investing is long term. This is gambling on sentiment.
aapl green EOD
this shows you age.
I guess APHA just gonna stay here until tmrw if house passes bill or not lol
Should dove in at the sub 40 it was like two weeks ago
We said the same about high support at $25, $24, $23, $22, even yesterday was at $21, need to consolidate for weeks, i dont think it will go $30 soon. Hope im wrong tho
BA gang in lambos
Most the trumpies support it, they love terrorizing POC. That’s why they killed George Floyd
Since average estimate for BA is $200, can't wait for someone to upgrade them since they're now at $240, and they'll proceed to rocket from that upgrade.
Hold
They crushed earnings
Seems like an interesting stock to pump.
I love when SPY goes up and megacap tech doesn't do fucking anything

idk bud, sold at 208
You will definetly recover, don’t even think about going long on $ROPE. My guess is you’re probably young, still have a lot to gain in life, don’t throw it all away because you tried something and failed. 18k is a big sum for some but you can definetly recover. Stay safe!
I’m in always liked Ackman anyways, just picked up 250 shares.
Are you lost?
Get out of GME now

It depends on the stock. $NIO for example does not have second listing. And since this bill forbids OTC trading as well, you may be only able to get company settlement.
oof, this NIO pump gonna get sold off hard. stay tuned boys

Scott Redler has made me like $10k this last week. What a guy.

RemindMe! 3 days
I can take getting fucked on every other play, but this Nikola put is infuriating.
i love DKNG but don’t want to buy in for 50 a share
It probably won't affect anything except a brief sell off that quickly recovers.

Even if the bill passes it sounds like they won't be delisted until the 3 years pass without an audit from US people.
Remember it took 2+ years for shit to crash after he called it out.
You can have PLTR or GME, not both
Would you bet your house on it.
ZNGA 12/18c looking pretty hot right now.
Id5 conference still going on, MGNI and TTD will be the last parts of the call.

Did Burry really delete his tweets? Man that’s funny af. Hope gets rekt even more

If AAPL dips, you dip, we dip. 

Needs to hold $120.
Me neither. Airlines have a terrible outlook regardless of the vaccine. But boomers go brrr
Thought he was bullshitting, thank you! I’ve also got 500 shares so I think I’ll buy more if it dips down again
I was 150% now I'm only 100 :(

His thesis on the entire industry changed due to changing consumer behavior.
I hope u were serious🚀
I’m seeing quite a lot of bullish setups
There is no dip. Only rockets 🚀
Okay I’ll triple down on pltr
it would be a miracle if that hit, I would sell.
Yeah im looking at starting to sell leaps. Tons of volatility on 50c 1/20/23, looking really good whenever we hit about 25. Either make 20-40k closing within days or weeks on the next dip, or get assigned around 60, take profits then buy the inevitable selloff.
You got one thing right sir. It’s definitely a throw away account!! Trash it and start over. Learn from your mistakes and become a better trader.
Put a sell order at 25.20, if it hits I‘m out. (might delete if it reaches 25.19 tho idk)
if vaccine fda approved by mid december, will not be surprised if CCL rockets to $30 by EOY

It's still down almost 60% ytd

According to graphs, fundamentals, and TA, yes. It has to go up. According to markets, we will drill to earth’s core or at least back to IPO prices.

Why is there such a big differences on both by just 1$
Why such a short term call
Yay PLTR did the uppy
Isn't this new Azure product basically a Palantir rip off/ competitor or am I retarded

Good Q. Bull mode continues. FOMC next week.

I give up trying to make sense of these idiotic moves. JBLU has a secondary offering of 15m new shares at a price of 14.4 (below their close of that day). It is currently at 16. Same with nclh. I have calls I picked up 6 months ago but I really think people are looking at share prices from pre pandemic and think the stock has to go back to that as they don’t understand the concept of dilution/outstanding shares
I would go ahigher strike tbh but 28.5 is the highest it goes for that date.

yeah right!

have u seen how many cos' CEOs can't wait to get their employees to the office again (they're Boomers set in their ways). And Sales always requires individual skin-to-skin touches, so Salesppl will be traveling hard the moment they can. And then we will also have all those huge conventions slowly come back to life. and leisure travel will return with a vengeance with all the people who didn't travel this year. it will recover, the only question is how fast- maybe it will be more gradual than the market is expecting but it's a promising investment rn
I'm bullish through the wheel, not sure what you mean

But in general the biggest downside risk is millennial makes going back to regular life and not using disposable income to trade options instead of going to bars etc.

What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little bitch? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Seals, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla warfare and I’m the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Earth, mark my fucking words. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little thing you call your life. You’re fucking dead, kid. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

Do you mean today or a few days ago? Congress bill was why a big chunk of people sold, but the policy wouldn't go into effect for 3 more years.

I was excited to see it jumped up at all this morning and sold my monthly calls for a tiny loss, just happy to get out of it. I think stock options are the way to go for now, I'm staying out of options for a while unless they're LEAPs.
Respawn?
Years, but it is not a good look
How much juice do GME short sellers have left?
i don’t think he liked the balance sheet. could be way wrong, however
We are poor here sir
So true. Which is why I sold my calls yesterday morning :)
Well fellas do I sell my Jan 21st $25 calls at a 35% profit or wait for the moon?  I’ve sat on this for 5 months, ups and downs... but time is running out.
They didn't picked that symbol because it represent the country, they picked it because it looks nice and they didn't bothered to check where it came from. One of the items that were being sold was a wallet with the coat of arms being used as a company logo. China does not give a fuck about anyone.
my pltr call was worth 10 earlier this week, should i sell at 40?
Other than the obvious price manipulation on RKT, what makes you bearish on this company?
Been trying to tell y'all to jump in RIOT for 3 weeks now. Magic coin is about to pop off and shits going nuts!  Only regret is not putting more in it

Lol my gut told me ba this morning at open and instead if picked up aapl funny how that works but if I close and buy ba now it’ll start selling off too
Thank you, I do mainly short term fd's after morning spikes, earnings upcoming is make or break for squeeze hopefuls mid term.
I died
Cool dump ups!!
Here’s a free tip: When a ticker goes absolutely nuts not long after IPO, that’s almost definitely a marketing campaign by the big boys and the brokerage, to let them recapture their investment by swapping out shares to some retail bagholders. Especially when the IPO is at such an arbitrary price like $10 even. It’s just strictly casino table stakes at that point.   

The IPO at $10, pump it up to $30, and then take back their original investment plus some gravy while still holding a massive position and let the retail feeding feeding frenzy kill itself off.  

So if you’re in for a small margin over or under IPO, let your limit sell execute and take your 50-75% and walk away. You can also try to make some money on the dead cat bounce, but that’s a much harder game to time for a much smaller potential win.
I started churning some 30c 12/4 FDs but i think im gonna go to leaps on Monday. Got some 40c 12/28 too thats meh, probs close if we dip hard again. 50c 1/20/23 looks really good if we hit high 20s. Even if it somehow assigns im really quite ok with taking that profit then buying next dip. Otherwise ill probs be able to close within days or weeks for 20-40k profit. Lots of tasty leap volatility.

Cant recall properly, but doesnt the lock up for a significant amount of shares end sometime in january? So rly that's how long it has to trade sideways before it drops quite a bit
Yeah. This is just to utterly butt fuck the 12/4s
Don't pull out? Is the dad talking about PLTR or his daughter's pussy?
Yeah saw the ~80% thing aswell and thought why not throw some money down. Gonna keep yoloing the money I made from this position and will see how it goes. Hopefully I will love this autist by the end of the year.
already happened, it's been approved supposedly, means the merger is anywhere between tomorrow and April 30th, with incentive to get it done this month. We'll find out for sure probably later today, if not in the next day or two.

Tip for people playing ccl long term: in case you're playing leaps, take care when you set your price target. Their shares have been diluted over the last year.
It’ll be good! I got $6,000 on shares and $3,000 on the spread. If it hits $35 on or before March it should be around a 700% return. 🤞🏻

Thinking of loading the boat with PLTR January 2022 28 calls.
Good stuff, I don't think there's resistance at $20, though.

I think FMV now is between $16ish where the shorts want to cover, and $16.50 where there seems to be some sellers left.

Above that, there's $18.

And above that, my guess is $22-$24, because that's where fundamentals would put FMV sometime mid next year.

Seriously, they're about to get approval for the first covid vaccine in the biggest market in the world. Who in their right mind is selling that right now. That's said, thanks for the cheap calls I'm going to buy in a few days
puts are down like 80% in two days on a .2% pump. Even with VXX pumping it's still below yesterday's close. No way to hedge without getting fucked by manipulated VIX and overnight futures. lame

Solid take. I believe if it's super risky, make sure it doesn't kill you. The more cash you have the more valuable that 7% a year becomes and the less likely you are to put up high risk to get higher return. Compounding is mental if you start early and supplement with some yolos when you have the cash.

the fuck are you talking about gimme a link
I understand your concern. If it does I’m going to keep buying shares. Been following for 20 years and it has this history. Buy on weakness. The weakness lasts 6 to 12 months and then its off to the races. I’ve never made less than 50%. Usually only takes a 12 month holding period. Then I sell too soon and it goes up another 30 to 50%....lol.

That’s a formality. Many companies file huge extensions to avoid having to go back and get an extra couple of days here or there. Doesn’t mean the merge is delayed until then.

> Do you recall what smartphones looked like beforehand? They were hideous; overly complex with varying bodies.

Yes, and Apple simplified it. By a lot. They had been on the usability train for a while. 

> iPhone comes along with the signature Apple minimal design that can appeal to EVERYONE and here we are in 2020 with every phone looking like a damn iPhone.

Yes, and they are affordable to most people. And were the obviously better alternative at the time. 

With Tesla? Their design has limited appeal. Their performance numbers, ditto. The average car buyer cares not for 0-60 times. They care about reliability, serviceability, and cost. 

> Teslas aren't super cheap but they're not super expensive either. You're not finding the same tech in a Tesla you're getting in a Ford or GM model.

They are pretty expensive when you consider the price and affordability of the average people carrier. In places were range isn't as much a big deal as it is in America, they've been losing ground to other EV offerings. And you're right, you won't find the same tech in a GM/Ford that you'll find in a Tesla; you also won't find the comfort/luxury/design in a Tesla that you will find in a Porsche, a Mercedes, an Audi, a BMW. You also won't find the dealer support/service/aftermarket care with Teslas that you will find in Japanese makers. 

> At the end of the day, who's making headlines?

All of them? Volkswagen group just announced they're looking to produce a couple dozen different models based on similar architecture across their brands. The id4 will share a lot of stuff with the Q4, both priced differently and hitting different levels. Opel just announced the Mokka-e has been completely sold out for the 2021 model year.

It will go beyond that.  June was a head fake from relax of lockdown but pandemic problem was never actually solved.  But now with vaccines on the way, life getting back to normal.

lmao Burry shouldve been shorting SNOW not TSLA, this shit is manipulated like crazy
Watch the double bottom on amd.
I'd be pulling numbers out of my ass if I took a guess. The squeeze might play out over weeks, days or minutes, so set some absurdly high limit order with +1000% gains to try to catch the spike when it does happen. The higher shareholder's selling point, the more money they make so it's in their interest to hold into the hundreds rather than sell as soon as it hits 50 like some bottom feeders will do. Buy on the way back down from a ten bagger spike rather than on the climb to it.

While the risk is very very low. Some big events can happen after hours, such as a merger/aquisition announcement. 1 or 2 dollars + 65cents commission (if TDA) is worth the piece of mind. If youre selling CC's for 10 dollars a contract it was never worth in the first place lol

Thats been known for a while though, you dont think trump signing it into law would have a negative effect, even if short lived? Three years may sound like a lot but with all the shady stuff going on for nios competitors (recent kndi scandal) and how other chinese stocks have been dropping due to fraud, I can see this taking some companies off the american exchanges.

Even on a down market, spxs goes lower. The only time this went up was on the March crash. I own a couple of contracts, but I'm just using it as a hedge. I don't see how this thing will go up.

Edit: I forgot dear diary
Nothing. They revoked my instant deposit because they couldn't clear 10$ on their end. And they say it takes 5 days for a ach payment to go through. That's a fucking lie. It takes 3 days for ach transfers. 1 for my bank to give up my money, 1 day to go through ach clearing and 1 day to settle with robinhood.
\*$30. 🚀🚀🚀
Refund my RH account!
Robinhood is getting shady these days..my limit order price dropped 30cents after getting filled and when I looked at the price trend, it never got  high enough where I paid for....wtf is happening here. Bunch of BS
Lost the original thread. I thought he said it was a  CC that was expiring and OTM. If that’s the case you don’t do anything. You keep your shares and the call premium. If you close it than you have to pay the cost to close plus a commission (at my broker) reducing your gain-premium. Don’t give money away no matter how small.
[removed]
No I am honestly asking and I appreciate you replying I’ll look into the army contract

Buy WMT leaps and forget about them
Where you find this info?
Fuck all these bears they gonna get run over
Because the market doesn't care what someone says. Just like the market doesn't care if WSB makes 40,000 posts about $PLTR mooning. If we see anything less than fairly stellar earnings, it is going down. It's how the market works. 

I also fail to see how turning into an online retail game store does anything positive to combat sales. Sure, overhead goes down; to what? Match your immense loses of game sales as people buy digitally directly through MSoft and Sony? Not to mention there is still uncertainty with transition of power. What happens if Stimulus gets delayed? Retail markets are going to crash. Even if the delay is only by a couple days or a week. People are going to panic. 

GME mooned. It's near earnings, the market itself doesn't have a stable situation for GME and a correct is going to happen eventually. This is literally what happens in every meme stock this subreddit talks about, except a very select few. 

Don't get me wrong. I cashed out of $GME. I was riding a smaller moon, but still it helped balance my portfolio for losses. But are you honestly telling me there is more positives for $GME than there are negatives?

Hop off fellas. There will be another ticket to the moon. Don't get caught with $400k in a stock that is going to dip past what your avg is.

Unfortunately the American mindset is "we can fuck China" and "fuck China" without realizing that both countries are heavily intertwined. And coming out of such a bad recession, which China is no longer in due to a lack of covid cases there, it's quite unwise to get into a trade war yet again. Long negotiation will take place and this bill is more symbolic than anything, the SEC will handle it and a compromise was to be made as per quotes from the SEC.

I love it when people ask this question.

Here's the dirty little secret about gene editing:  it's largely useless, primarily because the organisms that need the editing consist of trillions of cells that already have the defect that needs to be edited.

It's best to think of genetic code as, well, code.  How many situations do you see where code is modified as it is running?  It almost never happens.  Sure, there might be a few highly skilled hackers and developers that can gdb code as it runs, but commodity software that runs on a user's desktop almost never gets modified as it is running.  It is the the road to insanity and destruction.  Now imagine that whatever program you running that you want to edit needs to copy itself at random epochs and whatever changes were made to the running code gets duplicated (sometimes with errors) as well.  

So... the model is that cells are CPUs that run genetic code.  Sometimes that code is defective and needs to be corrected.  Sometimes the CPU is incredibly useful because it's powered by something like sugar (a ubiquitous source of cellular energy) to produce something useful (like alcohol or insulin or, well, think up whatever it is that is useful enough to harvest it from where it occurs naturally.... or, better yet, where it does not occur naturally at all). 

The bottom line is that you have to do the edit while the cell line population is <10^10.  If you can do that, you have a chance at leveraging the power of editing genetic code.  Unfortunately, for humans, this means editing at the zygote or gamete stage of development.   The most immediate application is found in asexual reproduction (least complex) organisms.

The difference is this year you had a president who decided that his only barometer for success was going to be stock market gains, including having a 30 second press conference to announce the Dow over 30k. Thus, unlimited Fed market support was born.

AirBnB IPOs estimated at 40-55/share. I wonder if the price will even be below 100 by the time they are available
No stimmy, CRSR mooning to earth’s core.., I’m bankrupt.
+200 on SPY $366 C 12/31 bought yesterday morning 
+220 on TSLA $590 C 12/4 bought at 8:44 sold at 8:46 (central time)
I thought I was the only retard holding stocks of penny shit like titan. Small surprises that make WSB a great house of tards.
Don’t care about positions. Simply ban.
And, if Nio knew about this law months ago, they clearly have someone on the inside with pull. Biden also isn’t hard on China which is good news.
this is a pump and dump scam get out
Going to be 5 by the end of the month
thank god BABA keep going up
Goodbye pltr hello puts. PLTR 23 EOD
This is peotry
Is that.... A printed piece of paper?

Can I pull it out before he finishes in my mouth?
Their are no options for this shit

BA was the easiest trade of the 4th quarter but instead this sub buys 250%IV options on garbage
STIMULUS TALKS GOING WELL AGAIN LMFAOOO I LOVE THIS MARKET 😍😍😍😍😍😍
stop getting the TSLA bag dumped on you by Goldman
The CCP doesnt have to enforce any demands we make, but the individual companies will comply if they want to keep US investors, supposedly NIO has been cooperating for transparency.
They don't seem to understand when everyone and their mom is buying something, it's usually time to take profit or you will most likely end up bag holding.

You gotta get ahead of trends, not chase them when everyone else is already in.  Oh well, their loss, our gain.
Nah fam all Gucci see if this helps. It’s been lagging for me too, not sure if restarting the app kickstarts the bitch or if I’m just too impatient

Never say never but its very unlikely. Today. Unless Peter sells shares. Then whoopsie doodles.
Honestly this is so true, one of my coworkers he is from China (living in Canada) but still puts China first and told me they are sick and tired of other countries taking advantage of them (they were once one of the most powerful empires) and that they do not want to be better or the strongest in the world but the same as the US and I bet its the way most of Chinese think, I think it will be a culture war eventually

I had like $4k sitting in a random after tax account I wasn’t using so I decided to just buy some spy leaps and let them sit just to see what happened.

That account is currently blowing my main account out of the water in terms of %gain and I use maybe 1% of the mental resources I use on my main account.

Unless you truly enjoy stressing out constantly and taking years off your life just to make less money, ETF leaps are the way to go people.

Lol not living under a rock and yes, the UI works and totally was a selling point BUT I don't think that's as instrumental as the design was behind the iPhone. Do you recall what smartphones looked like beforehand? They were hideous; overly complex with varying bodies.

iPhone comes along with the signature Apple minimal design that can appeal to EVERYONE and here we are in 2020 with every phone looking like a damn iPhone.

Teslas aren't super cheap but they're not super expensive either. You're not finding the same tech in a Tesla you're getting in a Ford or GM model.

Can any of you astrologists tell me if TSLA looks like it's breaking out above 600? My gut and autistic senses say so. New ATH today on that massive 780 upgrade.
The Stock goes up because someone was willing to buy it at that price, the Stock goes down because someone was willing to sell it at that price.

Nothing else is known, everything passed that is conjecture.

Really reread that sentence carefully, its all conjecture. Maybe a stock crashed because the earnings report was dog shit, or maybe some boomer fat fingered a sell. Its all conjecture.
Mrmd needs some volume!
i sold a few 16 puts
54 because that's the average lifespan of people like you with autism.
they bought to close.  Basically they sold 12/4 call and now they are buying back to lock in profit, close postion, n free up cash.

Does this mean that the debt paid off by a company is equal to the drop in price per share?
It is soon I agree but unless these study results were announced with warning, they're still under the radar

If I'm wrong, it's already priced in, but that would surprise me as AbbVie has been the opposite of volatility lately. An alternative is like you said the market doesn't care about this till it's approved.

well you're not good at this, what did you expect?
Not to mention Nio knew about this law months before it was signed. Meaning their lobbyists/Dems are feeding them information because they don’t really want to hurt them. I can’t imagine those people would hold Nio to the fire

Already had earnings, yesterday after hours
Following up on my previous post today discussing SRNE, we're YOLO-ing $8.50c for tomorrow that cost $10 each.  On the chance they drop any of the PRs we're expecting, a spike similar to what happened last week means a one-day \~700% gain.  Fairly large upside for a $10 bet...

I cant get entirely into that, I've only worked with Gotham's integration into DoD. I can tell you it was an absolute game changer compared to what we were doing 10 years ago and incredible how it integrates into any existing system. Their site engineers were smart as fuck and it never went down. If you know government systems "never down" is a foreign phrase.

Seeing how the DoD uses it I can absolutely see every company with money using Foundry. There is literally no other company competing for what they offer. Seeking Alpha had a good article this morning on it and I just sat nodding my head reading.

Finally some enby representation :)
The play for today isn't PLTR. It's already up 10% FFS!!

No fellow retards, the play for today is **ULTA** and here is why.

I believe ULTA will hit $350+ by summer 2021. They have lots of tailwinds: 
(1) Economy opening back up---they have done well to shift to online sales but their main sales channel still remains brick and mortar stores. 

(2) Their new partnership with Target is a stroke of genius! Sephora is now playing catch-up by entering a partnership with Kohl's. Unfortunately for them, Target is simply superior to Kohl's with respect to their target market: upper and middle class, mostly white women.

ULTA+TGT = (Becky energy)^2. Both ULTA and TGT are phenomenally well-run companies, this synergy will be insane. 

(3) Pent up demand for make-up and beauty products by all the following (sometimes forgotten by WSB but crucial) demographic: Kaileigh (14-18 yrs), Becky (19-35 yrs), Karen (35-45), and Susan (45-60).

So whats the play? Long-dated call options, if you can afford them. Load up on summer 2021 calls and you'll be handsomely rewarded. Yes, I know this goes against the zeitgeist of WSB but there is a reason why 90% got wiped out by PLTR and NIO. Godspeed and good luck to all.

fuck off GME.. fuck right off with that short squeeze bs.. the number of times i have got burnt playing GME is ridiculous
It's a day before expiration, yes.
Hold them
Alright BABA, I’m going in!
Real advice: Wait until a move becomes clear. Right now I feel like it's retarded to buy calls at the top of a historic bull run that seems to be running out of steam, but it's also retarded to buy puts when we've been in a historic bull run that's won't stop.

WSB advice: yolo on SPY $366 puts expiring tomorrow

Life advice: alcohol to numb the pain of losing it all

real real advice: if you've only got $100 then stop playing this game
33% gains would make most of this sub nut
Same why the fuck am I holding this fucker
Not gonna lie, I needed to see PLTR up, even if it is only for a couple hours.

Seems premature for profit taking on this one but 🤷🏻‍♂️
Only wrong with buying at 70 if you bag hold it like a moron
@crediblec*ypto and @Iamc*yptowolf are my two favorites 

Edit:lol the asterisks fucked with the formatting but throw a couple r’s between those c’s and y’s 

Wolf isn’t as educational but he’s one of the people that if he disagrees with me I instantly begin to doubt my position, and has solid charts 

Credible is nice because he also has great charts but he does some good like 20 minute or so videos that can be really informative

Right now I’m pretty exclusively in c rypto, just holding spot, I don’t have access to margin for c rypto, and I’m a shit trader anyways lol keep that in mind as well 😂 you’re listening to a guy who’s terrified of margin trading and too lazy to learn despite the fact that it would probably benefit me quite a bit 

Not sure if the auto-mod has the tickers banned so I’ll stick with the asterisks, but I’m balls deep in L tecoin, and holding decent amounts of E hereum, OXT, R pple, D gecoin, and Uniswap. I’m pretty fluid with these though, if I see something that looks like it’s ready to run then I’ll flip shit around. 

Edit: had to take out the asterisks lol

Only other thing I have is a minor position in SPXS just to give me some amount of exposure to shorting the market
Lol like you're breaking news?!. Nancy and husband gave calls, get some calls fool!

Wow palantards are gaining sentience
Well, yeah, that part is good... but if a lot of it is delta hedging, that's all gotta come off at some point.
Thic 🐝  can go to hell, if I'm not seeing any merger news or extension by eod im dumping this shit
GME dump incoming
The only way that a community like us can effect the market is through options, which are a much smaller market for each contract. Even still. They can hedge that shit out pretty quickly with shares.

I think people's ideas of grandeur are a bit overstated. You can easily get rich trading. No sense in pretending we're.. y'know. The captains.

Cmon get up to 368 ya beautiful bastard

1. That oversight was into shitbag firms like Kandi that were commiting fraud , doesn't effect NIO , Xpeng and Li

2. That bill will pass and will end up coming to the treasury sec, and years of negotiations with China and the SEC will occur, it's not black and white. 

3. I don't think Biden would just come to office and immediately raise taxes while still in a recession as that's the opposite of what you do during a recession and the fed will reiterate that to him. Any tax hikes of cap gains or something that effects people other than ultra wealthy, will be implemented when the U.S comes out of contraction which the Fed said would be 2H 2020.

I got XLE/XOM/SLB/ET/KMI.  Most people here only care about GME/NIO/TSLA/PLTR when there is a huge rotation back to recovery stocks going on.
Eh. I feel like Intel will continue to hit new lows every time there's an earnings report. I was bullish on them the first time they dropped 10-15%. Then they erased 3 months of slowly climbing back up in one day.. Lol was kind of shocked @ the volume when i looked at them, like who tf is buying Intel shares at this point.
Pew pew
I hope
How do you guys get free stock on RH? I’ve sent the invites to my contact but they aren’t interested in trading, any other way to get them?

How long to hold NNDM? Long term or pump and dump?
Shares and sold some calls on them. That’s the move with these memes. Buy call options and shares early enough then after 3 days of 5-10% jumps start selling calls on your shares. Wait for a bank or activist investor to call them out as overbought so they can buy in cheaper. Hold shares until WSB looks back and says “holy shit guys remember x?” It’s on a moonshot and I got solid DD it’s gonna triple in the next month. Rinse repeat

You’re fucked
Thanks for your work in helping people understand options. One thing that’s important for aspiring traders to know about CCs is that’s not really the worst case scenario. At least you shouldn’t look at it that way. Technically, the worst case scenario is the underlying goes to zero. You still own the underlying stock. If the underlying price drops more than the cost basis (stock purchase price minus call premium(s)), you’re losing money. So for any covered call, worst case scenario is however much the underlying drops in price. I imagine eventually you’ll talk about the Greeks, where it becomes clearer that your position’s risk is tied to—among other things—the underlying stock price. I’m that sense, a covered call isn’t materially different than any other strategy with a similar risk profile. I only mention this bc from a number of other well meaning comments here, covered calls do not help or save you in any way when the stock price starts to tank. Before and during the financial crisis, I sold a shit load of covered calls on stocks like Washington Mutual and Wachovia. At first, it wasn’t a big deal when stock prices started to drop. I just kept selling calls. Quickly, however, you get into a situation where you can’t sell far enough out of the money to get any premium at all, and you become hesitant to sell anything that has any premium bc getting assigned at those lower strike prices would take you out of the position at a huge loss. It’s a shitty situation to be in, and it’s absolutely part of the covered call trade analysis people should consider. Thanks again for your extensive post—you’re a far better person than me for devoting so much of your time to help others.

Eye surgeon, five years out of residency and just now hitting the big time with a pretty full schedule. $650k/year at the moment which is 75th-80th percentile nationally. You can hit a million a year with luck and being in a good spot and never taking a day off.

That said, you start around $175k and the youngest you can be at that point is about 30. I’ve still got over $100k in student loans. So while the number sounds amazing (and it is), it’s a bitch to get there.

What a dumb fucking comparison. Omega sells at least half as much as rolex, Tesla sells nothing compared to other  carmakers. Yet is worth a multiple of them. According to you rolex would have to be 10000 more valuable than omega. Nobody gives a fuck about brand value and if they do then Tesla won’t be their choice because of their subpar pisspoor QC. And Tesla is still just selling cars for upper class douches, the vast majority of EVs being sold are not gonna be Tesla models. Not everyone wants a coupe or an ugly cyberpunk truck
Bahahaha best dd
What's your sentiment of pltr in the short term?
company announces some merger or stock buyback after hours. I mean its super low risk, but peace of mind for a dollar or two is not a bad trade off.

I have a Grinch fetish. My boyfriend knows about this and for the most part accepts it. He isn't crazy about it and doesn't really get it but he at least tries which is all I ask. He'll sometimes read the book to me to set the mood, or if he's really feeling kinky tell me "You're a mean one" in the heat of the moment. He's even begrudgingly come around to at least playing one of the three versions of the film every time we do the deed (although we tend to stay away from the live-action one because it's too much for me).

The thing is, I don't want to hear about the Grinch or listen to the Grinch or watch the Grinch. I want to be fucked by the Grinch. And for the record this is common among women. The Grinch's bulging sack of toys to me (and many others) is what a Mack truck is to Cardi B. The fact that he's good with dogs and experienced trauma at a young age makes me want that long, fuzzy dick even more.

My boyfriend asked me what I wanted for Christmas and I told him straight up. I told him to put on the greenest, silkiest Grinch costume he could find, kidnap me from my bed on Christmas Eve, and then ravage me in front of the Christmas tree.

He flat out refused. Said it was too weird for him. I was literally begging this man to let this pussy save Christmas and he was like nah, I'm good. It ended up turning into a fight where he admitted he only gave into my initial Grinch kinks to placate me and was still uncomfortable about the fact that I had moaned "Grinch" during sex a few weeks ago, but only because his song was playing in the background.

So he's drawn a line. And if I don't drop the Grinch fetish (which as I said is incredibly common among women but sadly taboo) he's done for good. I don't want to lose him over this. But it's really hard for me to see past my sexual proclivities especially during Christmas season. Is there any way we can even compromise on this, or do I simply need a more adventurous man?

No, this is it. Apple $123 from now until apocalypse
Given the IV and delta, if it's just a straight line calculation to figure out how much they need to backstop, it's gotta be higher than that.

So.  Yeah.  Good point.

God, I hope this fucking skew to the buy side on FINRA isn't backstopping options bets instead of short covering.

SPLK is another warning shot for this cloud bubble.  This was supposed to be their quarter, now their growth is tapering off, thats what happens with growth stocks, they disappoint and they're toast.  

ZS makes \~$10mil more rev than expected and the stock gains like $5B market cap in a day, same with OKTA.  Makes sense.
I actually agree that PLTR is a good long term hold. I have March and November calls. This guy just doesn't put forth a good argument.

I remember VIX rose like 3 days straight along with SPY but practically no one paid attention cause Softbank go brrr. And then we lost everything. Obviously today isn't a 100% parallel to September, but the greed is here for sure
It's not passing the senate, but passing the house. Sell after you get the bump from it getting through the house, buy after the dip from it not passing the senate. Easy $$

why is CCL going up? I made money on it I’m not mad I literally just don’t get it since the news is that they canceled their cruises for 2021 🤡
The rich have more money, and the amount of stuff hasnt changed. Sooner or later the working class slice of pie is going to shrink.

There is some lag because the economy hasnt adjusted yet; they arent competing with you for working class goods (such as bread), but in the future manufacturers will adjust to follow the money, there will be less bread and more luxury goods
Robinhood still hasn't cleared my cash. Mother Fuckers are really pissing me off at this point

Thoughts on 5/21 $25c on MYGN?
“They already gotten audited by the same company that did TSLA” factually wrong Nio is audited by a local Chinese PWC branch not international also NIO is not under audit by the PCAOB which TSLA is and most other companies that aren’t Chinese are as well. Its actually illegal for the PCAOB to audit any Chinese firm because its against China’s national security. Peace✌️

Personally, I dont recommend playing earnings when IV is as high as ULTA's currently. Leaps (if you have the money) are actually a good play for ULTA. My Jan2022 leaps are up 120% already and I got them Nov 5. I believe ULTA will hit $350+ by summer 2021. They have lots of tailwinds: (1) economy opening back up---they have done well to shift to online sales but their main sales channel still remains brick and mortar stores. (2) their new partnership with Target. Its like Bekcy^2 energy. Both ULTA and TGT are phenomenally well-run companies, this synergy will be insane. (3) pent up demand for make-up and beauty products by all the white suburbia Kaileigh (14-18 yrs), Becky (19-35 yrs), Karen (35-45), Susan (45-60) and even Gertrude (65+)

If you write a covered call and it’s going to expire worthless so you still have to close the call?
did a synthetic covered call on ttwo. did it with a leap with a delta of 90. But with the wide spread I probably closed it closer to 80 but profit is profit I guess...

CNBC pumping TSLA today.
Heavily invested
To me, one of they key points that people don't emphasize enough is autonomous driving. The autonomous driving will be a huge market and it is currently still in early exploration phase. It is basically AI, and AI is learning from trial and error. Which company has the most vehicles in the world with self-driving systems? TESLA does. The more cars they have on road, the more data they can collect and the better their autonomous driving AI can improve. A lot of companies are working on the self-driving cars, the basic concept is the same, but real life conditions can never be simulated in a lab
BA with some retard strength
Exactly
Thanks!
I just want to sell my PTON calls for 10% profit. It gets up 8% and plummets every time 😑

Pltr gonna end the day red. Book it
Apple needs to make up it's fucking mind
I think you’d be better off playing closer to the money. The delta on your options is 0.03.

Let’s say you have 20 options it goes up a dollar you made about $60 depending on IV and what not.

If you bought 8 of the $80 calls same date the delta as of right now is 0.19 one dollar move would bank $152 and probably will be easier to sell. 
There’s more to the Greeks that hurt your chances at profit when buying far out of the money as well.

I specifically responded to the democracy one. And disputing elections is a factor, but I would not call it the only reason to question US democracy (not that I'm american tho). You can't have democracy when a country has a significant intentional spread and support of misinformation, or a heavily bias media landscape, as well as actively hampering education efforts and dissuading people from seeking it.

Holy shit, that's been the 4th attempt to dump JMIA so far and it's only 10:30... Check its graph. Some fuckers out there REALLY want auntie JMIA dead today but just couldn't make it happen
So I'm starting to notice this pattern:

Early June - VIX starts rising contradictory with SPY. Within a week, massive dump.

Early September (3 months later) - VIX starts rising, while SPY cranks up, BIG dump a few days later.

Now, we're 3 months on from the Sept. dump, and this week VIX/VXX has started flattening out/rising while SPY is up.

 I'm loading up on some VXX calls with 1-2 week out expiration. Also, short dated SPY calls, since the last 2 times this happened, SPY rose for several days with VIX. This could be nothing, but it's something to be aware of.
Just hold on bud

This was the big definer for me. I was researching them on Seeking Alpha and it appears they are so far ahead of the game, they don't even have any real market competition at this time, and have positioned themselves so strongly from contracts and patents. It's been a privately held company for a long time with a positive history and they were finally ready to take the Public leap and expand exponentially.
Hype is over and Tesla will reign

No but it shows the Chinese mentality. They picked a random country on the map and started using it's symbol for their crap because it looks nice. It's one thing when you sell souvenirs with symbols of a country and quite another when you make random crap with the symbol.
So life as we know it is over. But tendies
Sorry noob question about calls. So you buy the right to buy the option at a specific price. What you pay up front is the premium which is usually pretty cheap. When it finally reaches a price that’s higher than your “right to buy price”, do you then buy it at your right to buy price and sell it immediately to make gains?

Yes three years thats in the near future and no they don’t get audited by the same as Tesla they get audited by a local Chinese branch this is about NIO getting audited by a regulatory government auditor which they currently don’t have.

Isn't that a wash sale? And so close to new years
still 55% less of value for pre-pandemic ATH
Dude who knows. Go ask someone with a crystal ball.
Yeah I closed them pretty low unfortunately because I woke up 2 minutes after market open but I still made hella! Wbu. Also just bough 4 contracts put
Because they have 3 years to comply lol
why would u sell those leaps at a loss?
Man, all these bad options put my account at a deficit lol
Honestly diamond hands are cool and all but anyone who held through last week is a jackass. Could have sold and re entered and made bank
This market s broken.
I thought ghandi said that?
The extension was approved for Tucson Holdings. To the moon over the next couple months.
Not selling Peloton till it hits 140
long term, but it is up ~50% in the last month or so
Yup. I spoke about that last week. No one likes business travel. I'd rather be naked from the waist down and take a zoom call.
ARKG is my secret bae. Been holding for a couple years at like a $28 average, gonna break my heart to have to bring that way up soon lol

Actively managed ETF is the best way to play genomics tech long term imo
Your basis for being bearish shouldnt be covid at this point. I am still semi bearish, but you have to understand what the fed is doing to prop up stocks. The fed has made equities worth more than bonds and commodities, especially for growth, forcing the average firm/investor to put more into equities. This plus inflation has created this run up.

Is CRSR worth getting into again?
30 idiot
Yeah but you'll never get an inverted boner again either
CRSR 🚀🚀gonna make you rich my friend🚀

Why are ev stocks getting shit on? Is because of the house passing that delisting bill if they aren’t more transparent ?
I refuse to trade pltr. Very unpredictable
🚀🚀🚀☁️☁️☁️❄️❄️❄️🌕🌕🌕 is that what they call a diversified portfolio?
No, just because Burry shorts something doesn’t mean he expects it to go to 0. Also, he’s not an autistic, one-eyed magic 8-ball lol.

I just bought some slightly ITM 19s about a month out
devils advocate: doubt, market over reacted, gonna rubber band twice as hard and stay there
Lol has nothing to do with being retarded (besides me buying at an weeks high lol). If u cant play the long game in the stock market and pull out at the first dip ur bound to loose money
100%.

He's just trying to sweeten that pot. 

I would almost guarantee OP never sees that money again if he lends his coworker that money.

I'd never lend a coworker 2k and I like my coworkers.
The worst is KSS and Macy’s. They’re up 90% since 11/20... which with the holidays is barely a few full day trading sessions. KSS and M are having the most insane retard strength since Nov 1. Disgusting.
Why is nobody watching ZS?!?
Mr stark , I don’t feel so good
I thought they restructured and that deal also expires today i guess not
I grabbed some at the very bottom myself
Yes, and you'll probably be smarter for it too
I look at it this way:  
if I do DD and the stock takes a dive, I feel dumb  
if I dont do DD and the stock takes a dive, I just feel reckless

Biden will sell us out even more (or do nothing about intellectual property theft). He’s done it for the last 40+ years. Fuck Biden!
Nio about to take off like yesterday
Lol like fucking clockwork I eat a 50% loss on a Tesla call I bought today and it shoots up. Fuck this im out.
I'm sure we want it to go up instead of sideways
Thank god for ual and pltr. I need it
Nah. Terrible stock to play.
Look at pltr chart.. the quick pull backs are healthy. It’s on an incline. We’re about to take off you tards 

PLTR
Yes... kinda. They’re moving to Apple Exchange.
Here's hoping. They have good reasons to
$25 strike. Obviously yesterday was better to buy than today...
Thinking about some calls soon
Why would you do that
It is really impossible to time it exactly, but the latest it could happen by most estimates is march ER when Q4 results are published (new console sales).

However, there is a substantial change (especially because of Cohen's letter), that Q3 ER call next week will do it.  Enough that I'm going to put a couple thousand dollars in super OTM FDs for that week, right before the call incase we gap up.  I don't typically buy FDs, or anything under a few months out. Either those go to 0 or explode, hah.
BRRRRR
I have JWN shares, but I also have CRSR shares at 40$, should I sell or keep JWN, or average down CRSR to about 38$. Thoughts?

ESRT upgraded to outperform with price target of $14. Currently sitting at 9.65. Calls are nice and cheap.
Are the shit-eaters back?!
I’m glad that PLTR return to normal organic 10% daily growth
They also have 900 patents on every conceivable way of doing what they do....most likely realized through using their own programs so competition will be nil.

Look at little socialist New Zealand getting a 4-day work week even though they’re not actually socialist, they have a freer market than we do. Meaning they don’t bail out the rich fuckers holding oil when oil goes negative and don’t tell bulls not to kill themselves when things go tits up, they tell them to get the fuck over it.

My friends,  PLTR is a tidal wave that is coming in the following years. It is going to be our Skynet or Rehoboam from Westworld. Predictive Analytics will define the 2020's. 

 This is going to be one of those companies like Google, Facebook,  Amazon, and Tesla, where people wish they had heard of it in its early  days before it exploded. The difference being when Google, Facebook, and  Amazon were in their infancy, there was no Robinhood, trading apps on  phones, and WSB full of a million strong discussing companies in live  discussions.  This is the big kahuna.

Why is GME fluctuating around the same level so much?
Aren't they the same person?
As a fellow bear, I get it 100%. PLTR calls are switching my orientation. We know that fundamentally the market is fucked but can’t time it.

I'll listen to anyone that justifies the positions I fomo'd into
It’s actually going back down, bud.
I totally see your point, but a stimulus if it's the one propose by Mitch is a lot less potent than the one proposed by the house and Pelosi. Surely if there's no checks directly to individuals and no $600/week unemployment benefits, there's no more steam to shit short term run-up.
Haha all good bro
Yeah, Every time pltr goes to green se dont need a post that says pltr to the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀
You’ll be fine by then
yeah we arent going to dump ever, market is going to keep going up forever
CRSR wat is you doin baby
From my limited knowledge, the squeeze won't be until next March or so, but hopefully the earnings next week will be the catalyst to spark it all off. But don't take my word for it. Good luck!
Wth is going on with AAPL?
you hate money if you're not loaded up for the shroomboom

I have a funny feeling someone is trying to scare me into selling my TSLA calls so they can steal tendies from future me.
Always
PLTR resistance is at 24.50, 25.00, and maybe 25.50 if it gets that high. Been bouncing off the $0.50 markers during the week's plummet, and now it's doing the same on the rise.

It should pass the house then sell before the senate rejects it
🙋🏻‍♂️
there have been approximately one million dd posts on GME in the last month
You’re a smart man I’m a greedy bastard
If it were so easy someone else would already be doing it, which would give you completion for bidding on this calls, which would cause them to get more expensive and take away your return.
I need time to digest all that info man. 30 seconds and I’d still fuck up
PLTR dip opportunity
12/8 is earnings for Q3. You may want to look at things like days to cover and some of the giant walls of text in GME posts for a better idea of when a squeeze is expected and what that will look like. Don’t get overhyped tho
Should've bought more today on sale!
You can sell stocks in an ira and not get capital
Gains tax so yea I like to adjust my positions sometimes
REAL AF

PLTR AINT KODAK I AINT SCARED THESE PEOPLE DO REAL SHIT WITH THE GOV
Shoulda sold...
I get the feeling the next bubble to pop is entertainment and travel.  Mooning way too soon based on how long a vaccine will realistically take to deploy to the general population and the rona explosion that's coming from Thanksgiving/Black Friday/Christmas.
Everyone just take a moment and imagine Andy Lefty shaking his fist at his computer saying "NO, this is WRONG!"
You right, its smooth brains trying to hedge their $400C
CRSR WTFFF
The nio dip bought me

I got a good chub going now!
PLTR up 9% some idiot here really said "here comes the crash" lmaooooo
Nice dude. It will grow today and tomorrow for sure imo. Then probably correct and chill for a bit.

Though in today's market you never know
Wtf PLUG
Relationship Started Wit.....  
  
Relationship Ended With CRM
Of course you do.
Rockets are literally a massive point. Pltr $35  eow confirmed
You missed it. Don't chase. Yes, of course sometimes you can be late and still get rewarded with it going up further, but the amount of times you actually just end up buying the top and regretting it seems to outnumber those other times. There will always be another day, another play.
Stop being so loud ur scaring my PLTR call
I. Declare. BANKRUPTCY!
Yeah my dicky do isn't getting any better either, gettin old sucks.
Luke Skywalker was some dumb sand farmer kid with no education or future who was radicalized by a strange one man and religion.  He was taken in by a terrorist cell and attacked the Empires Battle Station to kill millions.  He later would go on to personally attempt to  kill the Emperor.

#theEmpireDidNothingWrong
With the Boomers in congress, stonks will always go up. Slightly OTM calls are easy money
I’d also agree there. I bought at IPO so it’s been fun watching the panic.
I’m buying puts because you’re using gaybull app
This is all pure FUD bullshit. Everyone in the industry says that everyone is motivated to find a middle ground. Bill also requires SEC to enforce it. SEC could ignore it if they wanted to.
Come on CRM - keep it up. Volume needs to pick up
Kill the dollar. It's about all we have going for us at this point.
Ahhhh sigh... were my hopes to high... to just taste some tendies DAMN YOU NIO
Nooooooo.
Dump eet

Hope you are right. Bought back into NIO and XPeng.

There’s something we don’t know
Decking materials (sorta like TREX) made out of recycled stuff. The pandemic and low interest rates have been a boon to home improvements. Wood is a main competitor, but wood prices have gotten out of control and there is a shortage. Products sold by companies like AZEK and TREX are great alternatives and require far less maintenance than wood.
10:30 drop time again unfortunately
$ROPE. SPY puts have ended my account for the year.
I’ve been holding since $80.  I think it’s got a long way to go. But it could take years since their trials have very small sample populations. They are showing great efficacy though. I’d say get in now while people are skeptical on gene therapy. As someone in the field, I believe this is truly the only way to treat some diseases, but there is still a long way to go in order to show it’s safe and effective. Once that happens it’s to the moon
SPY 400 1/4 calls at $19 apiece RN. Crazy or crazy like a fox?
1. Whales of wsb launch DD campaign to pump the shit out of GME thinking that this will trigger the squeeze.
2. Everyone buys in.  \[you are here now\]
3. Squeeze begins.
4. All the paper hands sell after 10% price movement to the funds trying to cover their shorts.
5. Infinity squeeze becomes a 25% gentle squish.
6. All the short-squeeze whales bail once they see the float shares are in excess of short shares.
7. Stock tanks, WSB normies eat -75% losses.
I wouldn't mind that at all man thank you. So what are your current position?
Did the same thing, I’m a 🤡
fuck
Might be tomorrow yah
PLTR is falling, help!!
Gimme some so I can get in on PLTR for a second time at ATH
I sold my 12/4 22.5c at close yesterday. Boy do I feel like a dummy
Nice! I bought $230c lotto tickets and they're already up ... I'm betting that we may see a bull run up to $200 where I will sell hopefully
If TSLA climbs to $650+ by next week due to the PT upgrade, I might still be in the game
CRSR, every few days I think, maybe this stock won't be a huge waste of time and tied up resources and every few days I'm wrong.
Guess who bought back the call that he sold for a net loss only to see his stock fall down 🤡🤡🤡
Yes, for the most part if I'm buying. The shortest time frame if I'm buying options I'll do is 9 months. Though I mostly do spreads or CSPs/CCs.
autistic social engineering
Hold onto your gains PLTR ffs
Thanks son
15 mins ago?
I love it
i preferred chimpu
Hey retards. Zuo is one of the only tech stock that hasnt skyrocketed since Covid. Any sort of good news will push this baby up. Earnings are tonight. Youre welcome.
Same. Especially whenever I see the top movers for the day
Me too
Most depressing
The entire market is based on what somebody said. Value doesn't increase along with the company's revenue unless somebody says something or shows something. Then somebody says it out loud on TV or the internet and people start to adjust the stock's value up or down.
[removed]
If you didnt buy the dip on SWBI this morning then you should atleast get in before end of day for earnings.
This isn't a meme company like NKLA, it's real and legit.

This is going to be one of those companies like Google, Facebook, Amazon, and Tesla, where people wish they had heard of it in its early days before it exploded. The difference being when Google, Facebook, and Amazon were in their infancy, there was no Robinhood, trading apps on phones, and WSB full of a million strong discussing companies in live discussions.  This is the big kahuna.
It's joining the S&P 500 so although it may be volatile until then I think it will just slow grow like most blue chips afterwards
ah shit CRSR is gonna drill , aint it
This is glorious 🤣🤣🤣🤣
Thank you for your sacrifice
Bye bye VIX, hello tendies!
Stonks only go up, including VXX
Except the part about Nio. And then being at all related.
this is immaculate quality art
The market sentiment is a bunch a people just buying shit hoping it continues to run after its already up 7%+ that day. They DG it because that’s what it’s actually worth based on math
[deleted]
Why NIO tanking?
Good luck loser
Still think NIO is the long term play
It got to 25 today so I’m being content and anxious for that
Alright who FOMO’d into PLTR for the second time?
[deleted]
Not worried about iv crush after earnings?
Suck Nips Dicks Licks Growers 😏
As someone who sells covered calls and does the buy-writes weekly - I thank you for your investments and hope that your gamble pays big. I'll take the first profit you take the best profit.
I thought so too lol
Just when I thought I was out, they pull me back in

Wait the now billionaire ceo of LAZR is 25 and founded the company when he was 17? God I was so useless at that age. Still am years later too🤡.

Isn't that ironic?
No PLTR don’t die you were so sexy
When I saw the drop the other day I immediately thought of this scene and how it would be a great meme, especially after the helm’s deep thanksgiving masterpiece.  But I’m not a meme maker so I just had to hope someone else would do it.  Wake up this morning and see this magnificence.  Great minds think alike my man, well done.
Everyone was like PLTR POOTS, CALLS ARE BIG GHEY

Meanwhile I straddled options and feel pretty smart for once
Shit bro only need like 30 seconds
Sold my 0DTE PLTR calls at 25. Holding more calls for next week for the ride up to 30. 

Well done team!
Sir this is a casino
Rug pull inbound
Call
look at the volume for today like wtf, everyone that bought in yesterday didn't wake up today or what smh.
Yeah we aren’t gonna dump. Too much euphoria. Then everytime spy goes down any amount, Vix just tanks.
sold AAL calls for 158% gain

Good morning.  VIX, VVIX, VXX, UVXY, and SPX have turned on the fasten seatbelt sign.  The captains suggest a blow off top is under way and we may experience some turbulence.

Please stow all OTM options in the hands of the nearest bag holder on the bid.  Profits should be taken and please stow all hedges in the proper spot adjacent to your seats.

Please put your pending order tables up and fasten your seatbelts.   A brokerage representative will be collecting margin calls later in the flight for those who left positions out.

Thanks for flying the markets with us.

Do you guys ever sell positions in your ira or do you just buy and hold?
Thanks dad
Bad call.
Tell me why my ass FOMO’D into pltr at 25$
lol thats what all the noobs  say. its easy and always works until it doesnt. youll learn ..
lol at retards trying to buy puts - there are no bears left bro - they are all dead
Needed this
I'm officially afraid of TSLA after any hope for retail jumping in and banking gains like the good old days was squashed. Algos and big boys going to war the next couple weeks. And for those reasons, I'm out. 

🦨💨🤡
I feel attacked.
U too
The IV crush on CRWD
Congrats, you're going to be rich in a year or so. You're going to 4x your portfolio - this thing is hitting 100, I don't know when, but our best guess is summer. 

Sitting on 2 PLTR calls I bought when the thing was less than 10. Really wish I would have loaded up like you did here. If arc sells their stake then I might get worried, but last I checked they were still loading up. Peter Thiel just dumped another 14.5 mil into the stock too. Diamond hands to the moon bud.
I feel like if I exit corsair and go into palantir, corsair will immediately jump 10% the next day
what time is the weed MORE vote tmrw
You can't be that retarded
With hindsight 20/20, we should have sold it at open and buy it back literally 10 minutes later. That's a nice additional 15% gain right there on options
If everyone is fomo’ing in what does that suggest about the market view of this ticker, and then explain why is Citron/MS downgrading it’s price targets?
a vicious cycle

Hey, I did preface it with "I tend to be a little bearish". I take it there's a strong rejection of this analysis.
Umm
No. Just cut and roll further out.
Cut my losses with palantir at 21.75 yesterday.

I stay on my clown shit 😎
Yes baby YES - keep printing SPY I FUCKING LOVE YOU. TSLA, PLTR KEEP PRINTING - this market FUCKS so HARD - steroids - GIVE ME J POWELL - GIVE ME MORE MONEY FED PRINTING AHHHhhHHH So good
How are we feeling about golden nugget now that things are progressing?
Covid is not important anymore for wall street it's history .. for now if some vaccine fails are reported it will crash hard but somehow i don't see that coming and stimi comes in january all bullish signs .
imagine selling your PLTR shares AFTER it tanked and missing out on this rebound we're undertaking. 

couldn't be me.
Chill bro
PLTR pump and dump or is this something real?
print money with it
what are they up?
not enough
Seems like something you like to do anyway
As a bigly GME long, I don’t feel good seeing Fool do a writeup. such garbage, much pump

I mean just look at that garbage stock photo above 😂 Fool quality fo shizzle
Well that would be better but let’s be realistic so we don’t cry at end of day
Betz for money like all of us autists!

If you’re not first, you’re last.
dude it's gotta be something strong tho. none of that Crystal shit cause i got too much riding on this DD.
There is no crash to TSLA. Arguably the largest EV manufacturer in the world, in a market that is about to become the norm in the next 20+ years with major economies behind the EV agenda. The CEO literally sent motherfkers to mars and has billion dollar wins in previous companies (e.g PYPL). TSLA is what you call a STUD. It might get shorted but it will always bounce back.

Solid return op, now YOLO it all on PLTR weeklys immediately you retard

PLTR for Jan 15 have me cooling 😎
Not at all
Same i just feel if covid wasn't here were would we be at this year. Covid over and a stimlus. Plus dec always a big month
Locked in 12% of 40k on gains. So much pain
My baby(PLTR) is back <3

take the 10% rebound and come back to the dark side (if you like money)
What you smoking bud.

I feel this everytime I check RH
Not sure who is calling you racist/xeno. It's literally what they do - copy western tech. I studied abroad in beijing a while back and it's just hilariously out in the open.  


Also - they will tell you with a straight face that tienemen square was western prop and never happened.
Can somebody explain this GME play to me? So i get that we all hold the shares until the squeeze, but when exactly is the squeeze? Is it just sometime hopefully in the near future? Or is there like an earnings report we're waiting on? 

Don't worry i have diamond 💎 hands 🖐️😎👍

What’s a good earnings play on it?
Always BTFD
My cost basis is really low on this. Only way is ⬆️
Nah 24.88 from 25 is not dumping. Unless you’re referring to dumping money
This.  It’s not any different from a western label making lower end goods.  The shit you get in Costco or Marshall’s or TJ Maxx or Outlet mall used to be excess inventory but now it’s all made specifically for that distributor.
my old man said the chinese ev stonks are just like the chinese internet companies of the dot-com crash. buying calls anyways. fuck you dad
All in FDX 1/15 $340 C
yea, should be ok if it keeps this up, right at resistance
Jesus have you not realized what they do yet? They short before a report and set a very low price target to tank the price for the short term, they then cover at whatever price they want, probably a few days after, they don’t care too much about their price target, that’s why they are still going and didn’t lose all they’re money shorting TSLA and SHOP
lol....
Yeah I only bought 5 contracts dated 1/15 but I’m up almost 100%/$400 in 4 days.... 

I wish I bought more but I was expecting it to move slower...I only needed 7% to break even and it’s hit that with a month and a week to spare

Don't do it. Run from here as fast as you can.
I bought my first option yesterday for NNDM. I only bought 1 contract for $75. Sold it today for $108. I think it was a good test run!
These gains are unreal. I don’t even care to question the logic. Stonks only go up
No nut November may be over but now it’s don’t touch your dick december
what if it breaks 226?
Oh so we bust through 367 but now 368 is the ceiling
This sub is finally going apeshit again lol I remember it was a ghost town September October, the only people around here were gay bears
quick, get in the OG MU 90c meme
if resistance holds, next stop will be 44.8 ish. This is why you never trade within the first hour of open. Too volatile.

It’s some remix of Wing$ - Macklemore, but I can’t find the exact song..

What else benefits from the vaccine besides airlines, cruises and movie theaters?
Those are rookie numbers.
no chance it gets to 29.  I sold Dec 22C against my Jun 20C to make some extra tendies, but that got blown the fuck out.
Even if there is economic downturn in 2021, NCLH (Norwegian Cruise Line) is going to be filled with rich retired boomers this summer. 😎 Will easily reach pre-pandemic value a couple months from now.
Yeah 30+ end of next week.

Thank you kind autists! Hope all your futures are green
Really? I keep my read receipts on, don’t see it as a huge issue. If I read something and don’t have time to respond, it lets people know I read it and acknowledge it IMO.
373 EOW. Get those 370c while they’re cheap.
No I was thanking whoever gave me the award dumbass
Shit
Yay pltr weeklies are only down 91% now
I’m new to this. What does this mean? Is this a call or a put
I think that the PLTR higher low is finally established

$22 should be our short term floor I am hoping
Fun fact guys: when spy and vix rise together it means sell your calls and buy puts
Hoping 368 goes faster than 367 did
you are the enemy
time for spy puts lol
What about travel related stocks like BA, DAL, AA, NLCH, etc. 

They are all still much lower than their pre COVID values. I would also consider them all to be too big to fail, especially since we’re in the home stretch now with the vaccines starting.

So many taxable events that I need to get out and reset. Feeling like my shares are bags even though up a ton on so many.  God speed.
Uh oh AAL forgot how to land

Anxious. Waiting on the news.
Don’t forget to take profits

This is reddit
Well, yesterday yes it was
I will cry
Just got 2.7 shares i can say i own a rolls royce now
I am the owner of what should be an illegal amount of PLTR puts. Christmas is going to be PS5’s for everyone or me standing in the breadline with just my PS5.

Buy high and selling low is good for taxes right?

Snow / zs about to have me retiring at 23
This is a great idea
Print some big green dildos for the rest of us would ya
If the boomers buy in too, things could get spicy. Borrow fees are rising and WSB likely owns over 5% of the float. If we could get that number a bit higher and other retail joins in... tendies will be everywhere
If naked that those are some big balls
Do you understand how a reverse split works?
[deleted]
Good job dude. I'm in a similar boat now. -60% to up 80% thought I pulled it off but now I'm -30% again.
Pltr 2/19 35c
Lfgggggg! I need it to end above 30 pls
You’re on wallstreet bets buddy....if you want 100% serious material, get a legitimate portfolio and join a legitimate investment group.

My gme theory is that Monday hedges cover there position to raise premiums for weekly put options. After it theta decays on Friday due to sideways trading.  Evil

Oh yeah, still holding shares. I thought I read something that said the squeeze would start today, but you’re probably right

And of course lazr dips as soon as a I buy. Better go back very soon
I kind of want PLTR to close below 25 on Friday because I want to get assigned on my puts...
This morning PLTR dildo is literally giving me ptsd from last Friday
if CRM goes to 210 today ill coom.
VXX looks exactly like SPY

Snow/zs about to have me retiring at 23
Bought puts at 25.
What about my 39c? LOL
If Tesla doesn’t go back up to 590-595 soon I’m bigly fucked
TSLA's next target 760
Sure but I meant people say that in the sense of the crash that never seems to come. The closest thing we have had to that was the week of the split in September when I had puts but sold too early...
Pssssst. Take it and run, but it doesn’t impress these clowns. They spend this on their girlfriends boyfriends weekly hookers.
BB Mooning!!!’
But $PLTR trust me it‘s going up dont listen to boomer bears
Yeah I mean OTM have extremely fast theta decay close to expiry I'm sure you get they though
Yall need to stop asking "is it too late". If the company is good, has a good product or service and is growing. Whatever position you play now will continue to grow as the company progresses. Enough of the sunk costs type bullshit and being worried you didnt get in at .0003 cents
OP is autist too you think he really knows this kind of complex math?
Downvote because you were wrong ok
He wasn’t aware that PLTR would be coming back at this time. Sequel coming
tomorrow
What to yolo
🤡
Yeah I know, plus this was the special dividend of $10 / share. Silent Generation overlord Warren Buffett could have made an easy $40m off this shit.  Just looking to see how many more legs down before maybe getting some calls.
Suka blyet
Shits going up
 Needs over 125 to really move
I told myself to hold strong and then i read that this going to 17$ and i panicsold at fucking 21.40$ - literally the worst price propably ever for this stock. Sweet example of buy high sell low
Idk I just bought them at $24 today so that probably means it’s going in the toilet.
*Formerly rich
The sale on TSLA puts is almost over. Get 'em while you can.
Jinxed it

CAN SOMEBODY TELL ME WHEN THE WEED VOTES ARE
I feel there are better alternatives out there at this point in time but I just don't know what they are

Fuck it, I will if you will
PLTR is more of a casual 25% play
I know. It’s what research does for you haha.
I was going to buy it yesyerday😭
Do it now boutta tank
Fantastic
I'm a random autist
It was my plan all along. I saw it in the red and decided I need to step in. Once it was in my best interest that pltr went down. The universe decided to make it go up. Just the way it works.
And arguably only true in the early 2000s.  A lot of their stuff still sucks if you’re used to buying the best but for their price pints now,  it’s reasonable price for quality.  Of course the price is cheap and thus so is quality.  But if they keep their momentum, they’ll be making goods as good as western ones within 50 years.

I bought a Tao sound at for $59.99.  It was shitty sound quality but what I expected for a $60.  I ended up getting a Bose for $220 which is much better but also almost 4x the cost.  But in 2002,  I wouldn’t even have expected a working Chinese sound bar.

Yeah VXX on the rise for 2 days. Something's coming
movement is in the right direction.
You can do lots of research and DD on a stock and lose big. You can throw a dart at a stock and win big. YMMV.
Hang in
You know what's up bruh
always get slapped down when it approaches 8.5
lmfao
Quick history lesson - last time VIX and SPY moved up together, when SPY was ATH, we had a 10% correction the next week. Be careful, secure profits.

Right on thanks
RAD 15c
Like a thicc bee
Yeah dude, you’re still good. I’m still holding my shares, it’s gonna go up. Be careful when and if it hits 30 watch your ii. It’s gotta break 21.50 wall then 23.00 wall then hopefully cruise
[deleted]
BLNK, you're worth $30. Don't let people tell you otherwise!
I'm 20 and am not a fan of the "be a millionaire by 65" mentality, at this age, with $10k you might as well try to leverage risk towards a possible retirement at age 40-45, slightly higher risk, much higher reward.
Dang. I shouldn't have sold yesterday.
14862
Lol. The amount of jacking off occurring right now
what about 12/11 $40c? 🥺
Jumped back in PLTR this morning. Already up on my Mar/May calls. Would have been a better purchase yesterday but it really looked like left could drag it to $20
so basically for the past two years if you'd bought long dated TSLA calls you'd've made out okay. The ultimate meme stock. Do we expect PLTR to do this for the next two years? Volatile but increasingly moving upward because of meme strength combining with big money?
you think no big boys bought more on that massive dip? alright
September was really a fuckin nightmare
Call it a moral objection towards moronic trolling being amplified in the Daily Thread, esp. in the absence of humour. Anyway, as you were.
buy dipp
Let your friends think you’re poor, but make your enemies think you’re rich
Considering Pltr is about as friendly towards China as Trump, seems unlikely
Seems like it started at $12 and $12.50 but is trending up.
Fuck it bought som lazr. Bb in green then keep going bitch
time to go back down.
Lfma
what a cunt
I only care about Spacstreet boys

I see comment which contradicts my positions, I downvote and reply “Ban”.
Thnx for the cheap puts pussies
Its cool. I'll start over in 2 months. It's been real guys.
Has SPY ever been green the day after ATH?
He did mention 3 years tho and he said he aint forecasting stock prices. And Myth 3 what you wrote is exactly what he means? Myth 6: he didnt say they cooked the books? Where did you get these? Are you sure you understand the English language or are you just another troll from China?
Think about how much money you could make if you just could see into the future by like 10 minutes.
For the first time in my life,  I sold the top

Why isn’t L.C.A mooning yet
NKLA $17 EOD
PLTR dumping
It was around $300 and they reported record earnings and record interest and Jack Ma pissed off the CCP causing it to tank to $260
Oh no, PLTR under 25
How much you lost betting against PLTR?
600, but anybody guess. A lot of big funds need to buy still so she will rocket. Some will wait until the last day for S&P, others will do before.
Rule #2 Ignore rule 1.
UVXY green! VIX red, Spy ATH

Have 18 contracts for vale, kinda regret not buying another 18 on that healthy dip yesterday smh
SPY TO $400 EOY
What the fuck did i just watch
It’s crazy I bought pltr calls last Friday and slowly destroyed my account lost 5 k and have 800 left. 

Those same calls would be nearly worthless right now but I would have more than 800 with today’s movement.

SABR leaps
Sitting in EU waiting for some news
Tuscan Raiders how we feeling?
APHA 🚀🚀🚀
There’s hardly any volume on those
The drop corresponded to a dividend payout so it may not go up as much as you might think.

With that said, I bought 3k shares yesterday and sold 'em today for a tidy $400 profit.
The party has just started. Get in pussy
Can I just get a -1% day so I can get out of my puts please
I need amazon to break 3230 to breakeven at this point and I don’t think that’s possible

Slight up and down finishing in the 25 range today. Opens low tomorrow and then finishes around 26?
APHA $9 eod
VIX get back in your fucking hole
Very motivational. Someone remind me, what happens at the end of that movie?
wtf happened to SNOW
Lol rip the dollar.
Examples ?
Selling ACB $10.50p 12/04 at today's bottom has been glorious so far
Huge opportunity to buy or sell Apple at 123.45
I think I'm one day behind you. I'm hoping tomorrow will be my exciting diary entry.
People are hyping increased revenues.  I mean it's illogical because costs also increase.  SNOW is stupid.  All it does is lose money and trade at insane valuations relative to earnings.  Lockup period is over this month too, insiders are gonna unload at this share price, without question.
Nxt time I sell while 60% up instead of bagholding at 30% down three days later

Quick everybody tweet Keith Lemon or whatever that citron guy was called
Couldn’t be a worse thing to put on your insta or snap story. Nobody cares what you listened to.
PLTR
switched from puts to calls this morning. SO THAT'S WHAT IT FEELS TO BE A BULL !?!
Once again Citron was wrong. Andrew Left should be prosecuted and banned from trading.

Is it true the Chinese bought PLTR like beasts today? :D
Time to cover shorts! 🍏
Imagine betting SPY won’t hit 370 by Friday lmaooo America fuckers
GME is a longer play & will moon higher the more people **buy & hold shares**, not calls. If their Q3 is good, expect moon. If Q3 isn't good, expect long dong Cohen to pull a takeover & then take it to the moon his autistic self early next year. Either way moon, but no one knows the timing. Long GME APHA QS ACLS
Dear diary I bought a share
PLTR with the hope for WSB

but your Dec 4 $40c is probably still dead
I've been losing money all week

TO VALE-HALLLAAAAA MY FUCKTARDS 🚀💎🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I say that like I’m smart but I still lost 10% of my portfolio when it fell. Puts just helped me recover.
Picked up 250... it’s almost the lowest it’s ever been, and with vaccine need Hopinh flying starts ramping
Did you have paper hands? Or you enjoying your decision?
I hope you pussies picked up some $PLTR during the dip 🚀🚀🚀
Nope.... sure didn’t......
ZM shatters earning and nose dives. This pile of shit misses on all fronts and moons? Cool..... I never do this on lotto picks but I just doubled down and am holding today.
This
Ban
*Checks PLTR*

Looks like shit is back on the table for that guy boys
Downplay your gains, if you are doing well say yeah it’s been good, made a few bucks. No one likes people that brag about money, and who knows what they are going through.

If you are down, downplay that too so they don’t think you are a complete idiot with a gambling problem 

If it’s your parents then can brag about your winnings so they are proud of you if you need that validation

Around these parts, yes.
BA up 60+% in a month

such an easy trade
I'm pretty sure institutions all bought in at 18 or cheaper and never paperhanded anything since they were still profiting
#Reminder: PLTR bears are dumb dumb and ty for tendies. We eating good bois 💎
LAZR time?
I held onto the free random weed stock they gave me for like 6 months. It was $3 when I got it, sold it for like $2.50 lol.
Not worried about the extra 20% IF it does hit $30. Used the funds to make 70% on some ZI puts earlier in the week, so the decision already paid off in a shorter period of time.
With today’s opening I’m almost at even for $PLTR.

If it hits $26 eod Friday my shares are called away and I’m counting my blessings for getting out of a meme without losing my shirt.

RIP to all the $30+ call buyers 🙏🏼
Shut the fuck up you dumb bitch

Remember, these small dips on PLTR are necessary for it to keep skyrocketing
VIX and SPY 👀

Sir, this is a casino.
Wait... this entire community is mostly very rich people?
Well...let’s say they use 3rd party specialty hack groups within the country to access this info, the Chinese will blame rouge criminals since no “official” Govt/State agencies were involved. Can’t declare war on random hackers per say. They’re aren’t stupid either, much smarter than many of us I’m sure, as they use back doors, hidden servers, DNS programs, proxies etc so it actually took a bit to track the entry down to its approximate point of origin.
Anyone else in $SHOP?

Double down retard
Here's a freebie: $AZEK just beat earnings and has provided bullish forward guidance today.  Wait until mid-Dec to buy, because lockout period for insiders to sell ends on 12/9.  The price may dip with a potential 77 million shares hitting the market, but the company is profitable and sales are growing. It has solid financials and sells a good product. It could get close to $TREX in terms of value.

We’re gonna turn back on planes that no one is buying tickets for!

*moons*
All is well in Scranton PA. Tesla 660c 12/31
Chernobyl was due to a stolen design- it was a shitty design lol
Puts on tesla
NOW THIS IS POT RACING
Of course I sold PLTR at open and bought NIO
Don’t know if to sell PLTR now that we’ve been given a chance to make some money back...
S&P record high? Circuit breaker time.
PUMP IT!
It’s gonna fly through that buddy
Alright, just made $7k from ADBE calls. Maybe I exited them early and should have held till earnings 🤷‍♂️ but whatever. Profit is profit.
Get your 370c while they’re still OTM
[removed]
Be honest, where do you think pltr is going today? 26?
This week, 27?
SPY just went full retard
You gotta hand it to China. They used to be one of the greatest innovators and now they just steal shit from everyone while claiming to be authentic. I guess flat out denial is a damn good tactic.
Oh damn that sucks, still sounds awesome. Thanks for info!
CRSR go above 36. Thank you
Tesla should’ve been doing what PLTR is rn
bruh im balls deep in puts😔
Tesla trading sideways and fucking everyone
I was not expecting a green spy today, is just gonna keep inching up
Spy’s green dildo is sexy
I just wanna buy the dip but there's no dips.

Getting desperate, thinking of buying CRM and (more) BABA.

smh
BA🍆💦💦
Same 😂😂😂😂
i suspect institutions are buying in now, and are not going to paper hand their shares if a dip comes
We need to get Air Canada ✈️🚀
Everyone buy zm. Then dump it together
You were wrong af
Rise from the ashes you SOB
To the moon baby
Bought last week at $17, let’s watch this baby go 🚀🚀
Stonks go up, all u need to know
Fucking VXX and SPY doing that thing again......
I have no idea what I’m doing but I’ve scrolled this sub too long not to throw away money with you retards.
this is why NIO doesn't treat you nicely. this right here \^\^\^
Andrew Left (Citron) the GOAT. Shorted at $33.5 and rode it down to $21, made y’all panic sell and is now riding it up
Diabetic AND autistic!   


Hit the jackpot man!
[deleted]
Up big already today
I can’t wait to tell my future kids that I held through the great PLTR selloff of 2020.  Fuck you Citron and Morgan Stanley.  Choke on this dick
Broke through 30k!!!
I have a call I bought earlier for next week friday. I'm hoping it holds up, and actually reach it, but idk. It's a weed stock, so take this info with salt. lol
Cus it’s about to moon! Get in bro
Lmao the 🌈🐻 got to you
Happy for your Plantards, you deserve this one
FUCKK YESS PILATES OH MY GUH LETS GO IM ALMOST THERE
That what’s happens when you turn over 30
Bears in shambles
LOL? The time to buy puts on TSLA is literally the last few days, huge dick upswings of $40. Easily could have made bank
Turns out exactly what I suspected happened:

> Kroger (KR) came out with quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share, beating the Zacks Consensus Estimate of $0.66 per share. This compares to earnings of $0.47 per share a year ago. These figures are adjusted for non-recurring items.

> This quarterly report represents an earnings surprise of 7.58%. A quarter ago, it was expected that this supermarket chain would post earnings of $0.51 per share when it actually produced earnings of $0.73, delivering a surprise of 43.14%.

> Over the last four quarters, the company has surpassed consensus EPS estimates four times.

Yet the stock is getting killed for lower-than-expected revenue. So OP was right.
I only buy OTM tsla calls seems to work 🤷🏼‍♀️
JETS BABY
PLTR! 🚀🚀🚀 PLTR! 🚀🚀🚀 PLTR! 🚀🚀🚀 PLTR! 🚀🚀🚀 PLTR! 🚀🚀🚀 PLTR! 🚀🚀🚀 PLTR! 🚀🚀🚀 PLTR! 🚀🚀🚀 PLTR! 🚀🚀🚀 PLTR! 🚀🚀🚀 PLTR! 🚀🚀🚀 PLTR! 🚀🚀🚀 PLTR! 🚀🚀🚀
Lol I’ve only been active on here this year but I’m sure people were saying it back then as well
Bought 2000 shares at $22 (on top of a lot of $10 LEAPs already).
TSLA EOW?
One word.... weed
6524  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
This is THE way!
On the downside, I sold a bunch of 33 12/4 puts on PLTR which im going to get assigned on.

On the upside, I am gonna have a butt ton of shares and I got a ridiculous premium on my puts. Will hold shares for a month I think and see what happens.
No, I don’t think I will
PORNHUB STOP FUCKEN REDIRECTING ME TO PORNHUB PREMIUM OK NO I DONT WANNA PAY 9.99

A month REEEE !!!

At least step your access to VR porn and Mabey we can talk
And you’re a pussy
Very proud of all you Palantir devotees.   
I was in at 17 out at 25, but I'm proud of you fuckers for holding the line.
Bought 2 lotto tickets (FDs) on PLTR. Sold one for the cost of both. Someone else’s money is paying for my 28c :)
Trade talks going well
And then bankruptcies bank runs and collapse of economy 100x worse than 2008 then anarchy riots violence and war then global reset. This or simply keep printing and delay the reset till reset happens lol
[deleted]
"Oh shit, She passed out! I guess its the volatility" - That was hilarious.
That is a downward trend, the increase is going to have to be larger than the previous drop for it to break even:(
How should we be playing the air bnb IPO? Long in shares?
Don’t make me cum, saving for my gf when I fly to her next week
Its the easiest way to make money I have ever seen - buy short dated called on red days and wait for them to print :)
Is SHOP going to pull a SPOT like yesterday? 

Tune in. Break 1125’ish is go time. And 1145 is moon time.
PLTR new wall 25.40. Once we break that my TA says we won’t be stopped until 69.40
Yes, but for me it's because i get to baghold horribly red shares instead of losing all my money within 5 minutes.
[deleted]
Look low low the volume on spy is....
Spy new ATH

My account new ATH, thank you BA boomer stock
lets get pltr to 25.5
I keep saying it, get rid of those bags or show us the porn.
I held my PLTR. 12/31 $27, and $28c, not because I had diamond hands but because they were heading to worthless. 

But NOW so I diamond hand.....
puts on pltr EOD gang

PLTR making a come back?
This is why you buy dips. Only got PLTR dip in shares but hey look at it go
[deleted]
Apple about to run better get that dip
su bae, i love you
You have to pay less by 10-20% for someone to buy it. You need to different people that will low bid you.
My brain would have been SO LARGE if I had bought these calls yesterday instead of Friday

Edit: and my portfolio and my penis. All would have been big asf.
Because all the boomers who paid cash for their 2 dollar covfefe are no longer buying and the only ones still are are beckys and Karens with their $7.50 soy bone dry upside down 136 degree mochacinnos
Are you at break even today?
[deleted]
So much easier to pump w no volume
If palantir ends above 24.5 this is a massive win
Right? I'm gonna sell it at $29.5. If it breaks the $30 barrier then good for them and I might buy back some shares. But, from what we've seen in the last week, it drops like hell whenever it nears $30
🤡
Gave me PLUG at $4... I still have it lol
Just asked this a few minutes ago. Got in with shares $11.35. Seems like they always beat earnings and revenue projections. A lot of calls being bought up at higher prices.
[deleted]
Whats different
🟩🚀

Thank you PLTR believers, I knew you would listen.
weed lmao
RKT really refuses to move past 20 or dip to 19 where people would buy. Truly stuck in No Man's Land.
What lol
[deleted]
OH GOD ITS ENDING PLTR DUMPING OH NO MY ALGOS

[removed]
The reaction isn’t to options trading it’s just edited onto it to be funny, the options trading video is from the infamous ‘control the narrative’ who did atleast understand how they worked
easy
Damn idk if you guys can beat my 0.01 TSLA shares I made a 160% profit on
PLTR BEARS IN SHAMBLES LOL
Just broke $25. That’s huge. I suspect this going back to 30 soon.
🚀🚀🚀
Angelica is way, way hotter.
Pltr just fucked so many calls and puts in a matter of days lmao. Weak hands and fomo a disease.
Please donate to the dead bear foundation, thank you
Super doubt. Hopefully 26. Baby steps
Looking forward to the day I go to cnbc and the headline is: "stonks are up"
[removed]
If PLTR is back, you know what that means for GME... return of the memes.
June 2017?
You’re a dick
Guess when I sold PLTR. pain.
I figured there might be some sorta bounce today, but god damn
Eggplant emojis everywhere!
Buy the dip with Joe Biden Bucks.
[deleted]
Woke up to the smell of burning this morning, gotta love Smokey California
I made a note yesterday saying " I think this is the bottom but I'm not gonna buy"

Woulda been a nice + 13% and counting.

I said, how would I know what the bottom is I just started trading half a year ago.
Put a stop loss once you’re itm
Bought PLTR for the long term at $17, had to sell at $30 because FOMO train was moving at a totally unsustainable rate and could see the pullback from miles away. Now bought back in at $22, wish you fucking idiots would just leave it alone so it doesn't rollercoaster every day.
Still 8X volume left on PLTR! 🚀🚀🚀
Imagine not having bought the dip on a stonk that is manipulated to give big money a chance to hop on the moon rocket
eyes on vix boys
not a sell the news?
# wtf is going on today lmao
My guess is you typed CRSR in wrong, missed the train now you're hyping the stock you landed on.

I like that.
GME GREEN EOD LETS GET IT BOYS
Wait until dec 9 young padawan. Patience you must have
Maybe lulu calls weren’t the business at the top hahahaha

anyone getting in on the AAL short squeeze?
Thx I needed that 1000$
I think someone did the math for this...  GameStop maybe?
Idk CLRB might have cancer treatment soon, institutions say it will hit $6.
I have read this book before. I don't like the ending
Don't do that PLTR, don't give me hope....
Shouldn't the VIX go up only with increased volatility? Plus VXX is stable for last week and down 32% over last month. Not sure how to parse your comment.
[removed]
Easy money my friends - buy when there is blood and sit back and print tendies
Fuck yeah 🐔🐔🐔. It's blast off time 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌜🌝🌛♋😎
Hey all you that shorted PLTR, open your mouths for me real quick 🍆🍆😲😲
Today and Friday and this sub will be interesting.
I love you baby I just want everyone to get rich
Looking forward to the loss porn tmr
Haha best of luck to you
Switched from options gambling to share holding. This is much better
Retarded Shortsellers will get big fucking ass margin calls tomorrow = cover positions = PLTR another 20% +
The MMs got you’ll again with Snowflake and Palantir. If you ain’t got diamond hands and if it’s too obvious, then you’re going to lose in this game. Snow $325C  12/11 bought this morning.
already did.
Holy fuck. My AAL leaps are printing
They control it because they subsidize the industry to the point that the Australian and US mines can’t operate.  The US has been making sure that it’s mines can be operational.
Funny thing, the founder was obssessed with LOTR and named every company he founded in some way or another a fantasy LOTR name.
This is the way. Airbnb to $100
What expiry
was bagholding BABA MRNA SQ PLTR todays gonna be a good day
Just close your eyes and wake up to the smell of fresh tendies !
PLTR def getting to 30 or 35 by the end of the day

APHA $12 tomorrow when the MORE Act passes🚀🌬

Question for PLTRards who bought high. Will you sell when you’re in the money?
Yup. PLTR 2/19 35c

Balls deep in shorts I guess. But he forgot basic principle “Stonks only go up!”

So many (myself included) not gonna learn their lesson again this time around by holding PLTR too long
Pltr?
PLTR? yeah he's a cool guy. My best friend, actually
upvote if you're retarded
Why is PLTR going up so high with volume too low? $30c 12/18.   $39c 12/24. I just don’t want my heart broken again.....
I hope this is the TSLA dip
Hell ya going too pluto today
Crazy Rich Asians buying the heck outta PLTR rn, CNBC says.
Imagine selling PLTR when we gonna hit 30 EOW
Wasn’t the GME squeeze suppose to happen today?
No just stupid.
Yeah it’s lame AF, but I’ve been burned a lot trying to hold infinitely haha, especially with super violatile options
Of course, my mistake
i asked if PLTR 12/4 $25c were free money yesterday and you all laughed at me. theyre up 125% today.
I do not know what to buy shouldn’t have sold pltr tho that’s fasho
I hope I get exercised and my shares are assigned to the buyer
maybe i shouldnt dump 5k a week into weekly options lmao fuck hahaha
Fuck, there were way more people still bag holding PLTR than I expected...

Good call
Daddy Elon, the 🍆 was suppose to go in my mouth! NOT MY ASS
Now, tell me that Morgan Stanley isn’t working with Citron ?  Tell me one fucking logical reason why pltr dipped so hard and is now mooning despite no fundamental change in the company
Let’s go pltr only need 30% more by Friday to break even on my call 🥲🥲😅😅
Lol okay BB I still don’t trust your bitch ass but okay you’re caught my attention
Would be perfect to have Strider try to cheer up the halflings right after Gandalf falls by saying just buy the dip, hold it forever, this company is going to moon!!!
4,200 eoy
Buying PLTR shares last week has been amazingly nice and not stressful at all. I need to YOLO my entire account on penny stock options next week just to get my edge back
Anyone else teared up ?

Just closed out my ADBE spreads for 300% and I think I'm gonna sit on my hands for a bit. Everything is at ath and gains have been a bit too easy for awhile.

>It can get a little ridiculous, currently we have a team of Germans installing some equipment for the next 4 months and they’re not even allowed to go to the bathroom in our building without an escort.

I mean it can seem ridiculous but the cost risk benefit ratio is so screwed.  Or think about any data center.  They have similar protocols in which outsiders need an escort at all times.
[deleted]
# KEEP IT GOING
You’re missing that no one wants to sell anything. At all. Everyone is holding for a recovery bounce. A big one. We already had two or three but we didn’t have THE bounce. 

Until then Spy is gonna dance around ATH and betting against it is... not the greatest gameplan
Literally just buy SPY calls on dips / red days

The amount of times I have read “whoever times TSLA puts correctly is going to be rich” since June is pretty funny
If my company cuts my salary by 30 percent the banks will look at me and lower my value to them by issuing lower lines of credit, lower credit scores, etc. But in the corporate world that means your value goes to all time highs!

ElGato is def an interesting component. To your first point, ehhh maybe. I mean, I was an enthusiast, but you Corsair was very much not my go to for showing off. As for the younger demo, they tend to be lower on the available capital to spend spectrum. 
I think Corsair is a company with good fundamentals, decent looking sheets, and a product that will see a steady growth. Keyword being steady. I really need to underline that seeing it as overvalued currently does not mean I do not think the company has a good thing going lol.

hardly anyone buys game discs anymore, they just download it right from their gaming device. walk into one of their stores and you’ll find just a bunch of action figures and collectibles. and you can generally find better prices elsewhere. their customer-base has shrunken ten fold. so they may be able to “turn a profit” but for how much longer? retail is dying.
Imagine buying puts on PLTR at the very bottom yesterday lmao
It doesn't make sense. Much like most of the market right now.
WMT, please bounce
Good timing. This video was prepped.

It's crossed 25!!!!
Well i bought when Nio was around 25 so it wasnt in the money at the time. I didnt think it would move this far, this quickly. But a higher delta with a lower theta, the more in the money it gets. Yes it is more expensive. I guess it really depends on what you want to do. Nio has so much room to run the next 2 years, i think you could buy whatever strike you wanted and make money with this one. If i was just entering again, i would probably choose a around a 55 or 60 strike price for 1/20/2023. Look at delta and theta on multiple contracts and see which one you are most comfortable with
Check it out my friend. Be careful company has some debt however it is solid company that is open in US as well as UK , Ireland and most of the Europe. Despite what I said winter is coming people will be fuckin happy to just change scenery and go from netflix on the coach to the cinema. In the long term I expect at least minimal and safe double of my investment.
So PLTR hitting 100 EOY? I need my Jan 15 40C to print so I can make up for my sissy cuck paper hands...

If you had ADBE ITM calls which are up 100%, would you sell today or hold till earnings day and sell before earnings? Does it go up further for the earnings? 🤔🤔🤔

What wall?

Well well well
This is good stuff but there are a couple important points the OP missed.

1. The OP wrote that you should always write covered calls OTM. This isn’t true. If you have shares that are a bit over extended but you don’t want to sell right now - say for tax reasons, you can sell an ITM covered call. How many PLTR shareholders wish they sold say Dec 28c last week for 5?

2. People like to say that you can only lose the premium when selling covered calls - but this is only 95% true. If you sell a covered call on a dividend paying stock and get called out, you have to pay the dividend too.

3. Related to #2: don’t assume that the counter party has to wait until expiration date to get your shares. They usually wait, but they can do it anytime they want, and ex-dividend date is a popular time to do it.

4. Many people think that your initial position is your final position with options. This is absolutely not true. Let’s say you have AAPL and don’t want to sell it, but you sell an OTM covered call. Then AAPL goes up more than expected, and that covered call is now ITM and you are showing a loss (on paper). You could reach in your wallet and buy to close, but you can use options to pay this loss. Say the covered call goes $2 ITM. You can pull up the options chain and find a future dated call to sell at a higher strike price that covers closing the older position. You might even be able to collect more premium to boot. It converts intrinsic value of the call you sold to extrinsic value. You can do this as many times as you want.
don’t buy a option for this stock unless your ready to hold it for awhile

As a retard,may i ask why got the ban? Whats wrong with making money?
If you did not buy PLTR talk to me I’m doing research on your specimen
PLTR 30 EOD!!
Why the fuck can’t I ever close my goddamn fuckin stupid debit spreads
You just described 95% of the people in this sub
I wish I could afford stock. Thats why I bought this stupid fucking call which is basically a 40 dollar lotto ticket. Lol
I hate this game lol damn my paper hands
PLTR too low imo should be around 110-115 per share
Fuck I sold 27c on PLTR 😂
Well ya if you’re a bear. If ur bull just 💎👐

Thank you for your service sir

PLTR - All aboard. I know a rocket ship when I see one.   🚀
the only people who are still holding pltr are autists with calls, so there won't be a boomer selloff
Nothing wrong with starting fresh with PLTR stocks
FYI, some users cannot use the forms link as it returns a HSTS security exception.
Well, that’s something that’s moot.  A coat of arms or even a flag isn’t something you can stop someone from using.  You could start a clothing company and plaster the Chinese flag on everything and the Chinese couldn’t legally do anything.  Or an American flag on everything and the US can’t and wont do anything.
PLTR cmon only 6 more dollars to break even!
Then comes bargaining.... Then comes depression.....

I’ll let PLTR spy on my if it can reach 40 EOY
It's a weird combination of blue chip value stock and tech vibe, and their sales haven't gone down.
It only assumes TSLA will sell 15 million cars in 2040, or 20% of the entire car market.

That's a conservative estimate they make btw, 20 million is their bull case. What a fucking joke.

I told you losers to buy JD yesterday but no one was listening. Bought the shit out of that dip below $83. Saw it flush and literally knocked shit over on my desk to throw orders in

Great swing trade, just took 50% off and letting the other half ride.

That's fine GME and NIO. I don't like money anyways.
Ok chill out a bit PLTR we all know what happened last time you rose too high too fast
I don't think they're healthy at all...but survivable that's all that matters

Exactly, this shows China has leverage in the negotiation and most likely, a compromise will be reached.  

What is the point of delisting Chinese companies when they can continue to raise capital from the HK exchange?  I thought this bill is supposed to benefit US investors?

China has already soften its stance.  I expect the US to do the same (the Treasury is the one that decides what to enforce).  As a NIO investor, I welcome a second audit by a US regulatory agency.  In doing so, more  investors would feel comfortable investing in NIO.  Long term, this is good for NIO.

Why are you so concerned with my pltr positions 😂 make your own bets
Oh 1000% it’s possible I overthink and look too deep, you should definitely hesitate on listening to anything I say lol. I mean honestly you shouldn’t listen at all

That being said, I’ve used all of the techniques I’ve laid out here fairly recently in c rypto to rather good results. So if I’m wrong here it’s just because I’m wrong, it’s not because the techniques aren’t valid. And I’m far from a professional, I might simply be misapplying them 

If you want I can give you a couple of people on Twitter to follow just to get familiar with all this shit and maybe get some good trade setups in the meantime

ICLN mooning or what? Solar boys solar
I’m wrong more often than not which is why I’ve lost a lot of money being overly cautious, so my bias is now in favor of stonks ignoring gravity. I think nclh is going up. But again, we’re not making decisions based on data here, it’s algos and pros trying to screw us, it’s magical chairs from hell. I just don’t know. I got half out on 3% up now it’s 5%, feeling the pain. Feels like no matter what we do it’s gonna hurt. The markets not made for the faint of heart or light sleepers.
Yesterday: "PLTR shares sliding!"
Today: up 10%
I love this market
can su bae do a super reversal and moon?

Thanks for buying my TSLA weekly and 2dte puts yesterday, lads. Closed them this morning for an easy paycheck and going to go out for some Alaskan salmon dinner.
Its taking a break, it's not gonna be a straight line up. I would buy more calls a couple months out. I've been buying all morning.

I think hexo is the best weed buy. Positioned well to be a top weed company, their earnings are coming up dec.16th. Look at their last 3 quarters...way up and expected to beat earnings. If more act passes the senate vote likely won't be until after earnings.very cheap play.

This sub spammed PLTR so much last week, I was really like the new topics
God that would make me so wet
It bounced back up again today, I’d start watching to see if it does that again in the future and buy calls in the dip if there’s seemingly no reason for the dip
Lmfao. Did I expose u hoss?? Upping your order to 46k?
I hope everyone ignored the crappy articles saying that BABA would crash cuz of the bill yesterday and printed today:) congrats everyone

Pltr really doesnt want to hit $25 yet lol
Rh 1 week down 150 I think I can make that back 1 month it’s 2000 we’re gonna dig our way out boys one day
its all good. you managed risk. it could have gone the other way.
It’s a valid argument because no one really gives a fuck.  The US doesn’t give a fuck either.  The US spies on other people too but it’s just that we have enough r&d to not need to blatantly copy even a minor part of any project.  Most of the data is useful for keeping tabs on the capabilities of others and complement our own data.

I can't believe I'm thinking about buying into PLTR
SNOW had revenues of $160M, net loss of $168M, and is now worth $90B. Now that's value
let your broker calculate...
On the second thought, bill is going to merge with boomer extraordinaire inspire brands and the price will tank to 20. You know he loves his fast food. And hes going to announce it this time next YEAR.
Strong PLTR resistance at 25. If we break through we will hit the next level of resistance at 50
lol why?
Grabbed some cheap calls on COST dip 🤑
They better sell or this sub will be about 15 guys
25 is Aboit to be broken!!
This is horribly misleading.

1. Didn't even mention the 3 year compliance window. Too long of a post to leave that out.
2. Myth 3 is not a myth, it is true. Yes, pres signs bill, bill becomes law. Then executive agencies enforce it. Its called delegation. The means Janet Yellen - who oversaw PNTR under the Clinton administration - will be responsible for laying-down the law on this one (and who ever becomes the head of the SEC who probably won't be the protectionist nut jobs mango appointed).
3. Myth 6 is transparent shallow speculation at best. lmao "probably innaccurate". Yes, china has a law that foreign audits can't happen to protect state secrets. Why does that mean that companies like BABA, JD, and NIO would willfully have cooked books? Why wouldn't they just be compliant so they pass the audit? OP acts like the state secret law mandates that they have sketchy accounting practices and it doesn't. those companies have every incentive to have compliant accounting practices.
4. Myth 7 is loaded with shitty strawman arguments. The false analogies used here are not applicable. China doesn't want Wuhan inspectors AND they don't want to destroy trillions of dollars in foreing investment in their giant companies overnight. Both those are true. OP acts like "china never comprimises on literally anything" is an intelligible argument.

There's more to say about this but I have to go watch my BABA calls print.
That V recovery and now gains on APHA

Bought the dip, bro.
Goldman Sachs upgraded Tesla to 780 to sell you out of their position. Y’all really believe it in y’all selves that 780 is Tesla pt? Cmon now, 780?? 🌍🐻🌍
I should buy tesla puts. I should not buy tesla puts. I should buy tesla puts. I should not buy tesla puts.

Go stand on a rug and have your wife’s boyfriend pull it out from underneath you. Come back when you understand.
as of the 12th November, there are 41.54M float shares, 67.45M shares short, and the "Short % of Float" is 297.13%. 

https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics?p=GME 

if WSB has 3M diamond-handed shares, then that'd be 38.54M float shares, and this is the part where I notice I have no idea how the short % of float was calculated since I can't figure out where that near-300% comes from

so in conclusion, the new short % of float is a nice curiosity and I'd like to know it too
Fuck $TSLA, I'm out.
Interesting as smart money has made a killing off of Robinhood investors this year. It’s the same theory as the odd lot indicator 100 years ago used to bet against the little guy.

Well, options aren't that easy to understand at first and if you don't really care when you start listening 99% of the times you just give up.
Looks like TSLA upside finished for the day
Geez.. i wpuld have enjoyed these pumping memes if people were not taking these posts seriously. Sadly, they are.

I reiterate this, buy PLTR stock as an investment not a trade. Don't buy short term Calls.
Nice
To those who sold PLTR last week and bought yesterday’s dip, congrats! 

But also teach me your ways plz.
On December 26, 2020 millions of Americans will lose their unemployment benefits and come January enter default on their mortgages. 

At the same time, TSLA’s share price will reach 800. SPY will be at 420 and DJIA will break 32,000
[deleted]
Ugh, why do people think that using actual good researched market moves makes you money? Everyone knows you buy on the rise with all your capital and sell 30 mins later when you make a .32c profit, that’s just classic stonks for you baybeee
SNOW is back where it was at before earnings despite a meh quarterly. That doesn’t validate their evaluation at all. Must be good when institutions pumped it up and trying to maintain before the lock up ends.
lol retail getting sucked into PLTR again and the big boys gonna dump it to fuck you all over
take your time aapl im here all day
Same here it just needs to go up 50% from now
Fuck yes
PLTR 🚀 GANG MARS GANG FUCK THE MOON
Palantir, the return of the king. He just left yesterday to buy diapers for his child NIO.
It’s okay NIO you can go lower 🥺
You can be logical and wrong (aka shit’s bad, why are we going up?!) or you can hop on the gain train to tendie town and joint the winning team. Up to you if you wanna keep losing money being a 🌈 🐻
Maybe, but I'd sell before then. In this market, the hype is always overblown
It will happen today and they will 100%  agree to extend

I’m not in PLTR, but they’re Absolutely not a terrible company and a great long term hold
apparently you do not understand iv crush
What are stocks??
Why tho, hold man
TSLA stock as a company has increased output by 780% this year. 

Beating expectations every quarter, and therefore issa perpetual buy. 

Thus creating the self sustaining economy we've all been looking for.
GO VALE
GO VALE
BA is going to 300 by the end of next quarter. Certainly gonna be 150+ EOY. Just look at the 737 news in the last 24-48 hours. They're incentivizing airlines committing to more 737 orders right now in the middle of the pandemic. The airlines have a solid chance of staying solvent so they have every incentive to committing now when they can get the best deal. The positive news will keep pushing the stock up. This is a great plane.
That was not a YOLO. Focus on yourself guy
Only 60k shares available to short for CRSR on Iborrow, that's less than GME. Lol these shorters going to get absolutely rekt.
Can’t wait for PLTR to go red lol

Hello MSFT. Welcome to the party.
wait for it gain traction in here, buy puts
Wait...you're telling me that the All-Time highs market is detached from the reality of negative/flat GDPs in the world today? Well what do you know. 

The main issue with yoloing all of your money is that many people here don't know how to take a W. If you see your account at 2x or more than your initial investment, take out your initial investment and put it in a safer vehicle. If you made that much money, you can make it again if you have a winning strategy. And if you can't make it again, you have protected yourself from losing. People need to take out the emotions of "big green numbers make my brain do the happy juices" and just lock in those gains.
Keep doing what you're doing then mate
terribly profitable
Everybody begs for a mooning stock to dip, then when it does no one wants to buy in
Un fucking believable
Anyone sell their Tesla 12/4 calls over $600 yet??
Guh, I averaged down yesterday

Gettin deez tendies. Mostly shares tho, I did buy 5x 35c Feb to see where they go
This way is probably incredibly profitable based on PLTR movement today. I'm proud of you friend. I'm proud of you.
True. I made money on my calls so I’m just eager to make another play
PLTR could easily do $35 next week
MVIS is in LIDAR. They're working on delivering a working prototype to a potential buyer by or before April.
So uhh LAZR absolutely 0 buying
Buying flying death pits doesn't sound very financially sound to me
I bought the PLTR dip but also sold a 26C covered call expiring 12/4, which will probably be assigned. Oh well, a $7k profit over two days isn't horrible!
It’s Ben like 3-4 months since ipo lmfao
Starbucks all time highs when lockdowns are coming back in full force and with their core revenue stream being in person sales, it makes you want to dig your eyeballs out of your head.

Starbucks is valued at 45-50 a share, not 100.
Seriously, it’s SOP to just destroy everything.  Like when the US Navy patrol plane was forced to land in China.  The crew were smashing everything with anything.  They didn’t have enough hammers for each crew member and some used coffee cups.  Also, they were burning the flammable stuff while the Chinese military were trying to force them out.

Is BA gonna hold this rally or what? Im holding 12/31 calls
Mom always told me no such thing as happier - so next time you're happy - sell your calls.
12,345 and stop chasing FOMO you are always going to miss out
Same boat here!
Why isn’t anyone talking about Twist bioscience ?   
They are industry leaders in biosynthesis.   
They make the cheapest DNA there is and can profit from any biomedical research lab or any dna-related company.

PLTR PTSD.
I just don’t understand. Bought in Tesla around $576 for a $640 call and I’m down 1k. I understand the fucking theta decay and the IV crush but holy shit 1k??!
Bought a call with money from a credit spread im so bullish
Ye, well the stonks themselves are the hedge. My NCLH 25 calls are covered as are my CCL 25 and RCL 85. But I still have NCLH 27,5 and 30 plus some RCL 95's all for dec18. I'm a little worried if I cover now I'll be bag holding these when the correction happens and they aren't called away.
Got out of a spread this morning.  I'm still short a $500c for 12/24, but that should be gucci.
>CCP comes and cucks you like they did BABA.

You’re Eric aren’t you.. lol
Never sold my 12/4 40c 💎🙌 til I die
MOVE YOUR ASS JD and BABA!!!!
Only the most 💎🙌 shalt ride with the knight of PLTR to tendie land 🧙‍♂️
AAL short squeeze!
The problem is that loans are completely subsidized by the government. Everything they dip their hands into they further complicate. It basically tells university’s that they can charge whatever they please and they’re guaranteed to get the money. If student loan debt was able to be defaulted on, and if they government didn’t prop up the college education scam, tuition cost would plummet probably in my opinion.
I know it. Holding options and watching the price fluctuations is too much for my heart.
These stock "downgrades" are total scams to shake weak hands and pick up more cheap shares. Glad I bought more PLTR yesterday.
Dicks out for PLTR
CCL absolutely **BLASTING** through resistance. 

\+5% yesterday, +4% today already. 

After $22.25, there is NO resistance.

First, why do you think the bear way is the right way?
NKLA shorting shares gonna print? entry is 17.92
Sell if you up 100%-500% total return
WSB redditors are peddlers. Jim Cramer is a former hedge fund manager and author lol. Been doing this shit longer than you knew what stocks were.
I don't see enough $CCL in the chat. It's literally only been going up for the past month. I'm still somewhat concerned with the huge amount of debt they are carrying, but who knows about the future.
Lol. They're not even close to the same. LIDAR is totally different than Microvision's laser scanning stuff and has wildly different applications in autonomous driving.

It's safe to say that PLTR is ready to moon again. 

You broke ass bears had your fun for a few days..
Stop buying options lol.
Imagine thinking manipulators can keep PLTR down.
I've been short KODK a while, and have added to my positions.
holding through earnings?
oh baby baby, thats what i like to see, u already know, what im playin
Anyone looking at CLDR? Earnings out today and they’ve beat earnings and revenue projections several quarters recently. Currently at $11.35 and a lot of calls being purchased in the $12 and $12.50 range.
lol "investments"

how do you know this
And they said I was stupid for buying PLTR 12/4 40c...who’s laughing now?
PLTR 30 EOW?
I’m not losing money today😊
AAL ripping
Better delete your account and bury those options in your mattress so you don’t watch those gains every day.
To be fair, I feel like WSB should have a disclaimer saying that this place is filled with good to semi-good investors having fun with a small portion of their assets or just pretending so keep in mind that going full retard and finding a way to be proud about loss porns with not actual winnings hidden behind is not really sustainbable during many years and will make your life miserable down the road even if you start running outside naked yelling YOLO while laughing and crying at the same time.

So which one are you?  The WSB retard pretending or the real WSB retard?

Problem is, everybody thinks they are the one pretending.
It’ll come
Lazr dip
Can’t seem to go below 17, always hits 17 then rally’s from people covering short.

yes
Dumb luck and being on the lookout.  

I did this for blackberry last week and got a 3000% on some calls. Because it was a gamble I only put 50$ on them since they would probably have expired worthless. 100$ here and there, sometimes you get lucky if the trend hits right. You mostly don't so weekly calls are not usually the smartest option, just the riskiest one.
GME green EOD believe
Yo so what’s the deal with this 🐝 meeting
Okay CRSR you got my curiosity
Come on apha
Alright I think I’m cooked. I have been a gay bear and I’m burnt out. I can’t do it anymore. I still believe it is the way, but it’s clearly not the way to make money right now.

This happens to be the reason behind those man made islands in the S China sea. Everyone involved recognizes that a a naval embargo would be catastrophic for China. For them, it is probably the number one national security threat.

Agree. They will announce something on Nio day in Jan that will rise the stock

Good for some, bad for most
The wall at 225 for CRM is too damn strong
ooh GME earnings next week?

I will be sure to sell extra puts lol - free money
Why
[removed]
I got greedy and didn't sell my calls at 177%, now my contract is nearly worthless and expires tomorrow.
Honestly I have long calls and ima buy sum weekly put fds. Just in case
On 2nd Dec
Like I said BA plus CRWD easiest plays of my life
Hope not, or I'm gonna have to cover even more. :) I do expect a correction, but you never know, it might happen right after dec18...
Would love to see some big green dildos for NIO
Anyone else hopping out of tesla?
No kidding... at their tech is weak compared to some others... like Microvision.
Good fucking lord, tell me which part is wrong? You think China is gaining something from a trade deal they're not in? Show me some real proof that the US is purposely creating a trade deal that covertly benefits China. That's what you're describing right now. Fucking idiot.
The merger is gonna be postponed until April.  I don’t know why so many people are still on the 🐝 train and haven’t read the investor notes for today
PLTR bears in absolute shambles
ahhhh, tsla getting the goldman special...
Only an idiot shorts or buys puts against Snow at Xmas???
i can see it on my brokers platform
3 days ago I was memeing to my friend about PLTR saying how it’s going to the moon. When he talked about opening up an account to invest I said “ok but actually don’t do it now, it really is a meme” you really shouldn’t invest in something when it’s that overhyped. Literally every post on WSB was about buying PLTR, that’s a good selling signal IMO, I sold the next day
12345
Whenever SPY hits that mf 90 degree I get anxious
Robinhood gave me COTY stock. Shit was awful during the pandemic, but now that THOTs realize there’s a vaccine around the corner and they can whore it up again, stonk is through the roof!
PLTR puts at end of day is the play
Oh PLTR I want to be happy but you made me happy once... then took it all away
🚀🚀🚀 !!! PLTR !!! 🚀🚀🚀
Lol PLTR to the moon amirite guys?
Ugh I've been heeing and hawing on this thing with a contract here and there since earnings. Finally it takes off and I have 0 positions. So frustrating
That’s more like it PLTR 🚀

PLTR is experiencing the second wave of retard strength
Oh no , you're misunderstood , that's German for The Zoom The
This.  So much room to grow considering it’s way below its pre-covid highs and air travel will boom again in the next year I think.

Youre buying PLTR puts fresh off 2-3 blood red days?

Uhh..
That’s Better logic than some of the autists in here honestly lol
I can’t figure out whether to sell or not. I just took profits and got out 50%. More dilution coming, more deaths, vaccine approval should be priced in because uk approved. But Jesus it’s going to $30 isn’t it?
Is that good or bad

Meredith on the move.
MindGeek is their parent company and already has rockets on their page.  
They know what's going to happen.
Unironically BUY PLTR
It’s comments like this that makes you a retard. It’s not about fundamentals anymore but whole macroeconomic picture. When Dow hits 100k with all money printing where do you think inflations gonna show up?
B-b-bofa?
I question your decision making skills if you aren't buying LAZR at its current dip under 20.
Which would make sense but PPP was pretty broad. Not all the money had to go to payroll.
Apple has been messing with my head for three months...dammit
DKNG 1/22 90 LEAPS a good idea?
sad i sold for a loss 2 days ago but glad i picked more up on fomo again a day later

jǐnzhāng
despite our differences, PLTR 10% days are what I normally expect, up or down
Biggest change in my investing since joining WSB is starting to use call options. If I had used OTM leaps on stocks I have been investing in I would have made a fuck ton of money, but Warren Buffet says options are financial weapons of mass destruction, so I avoided them. I’ve tripled my money on teladoc health and over 10x on Tesla. But that took a year and a half of slowly growing my position on really high conviction plays. If I had put the same money into leaps of those companies I’d be wiping my ass with dollar bills. Instead I have diarrhea from my antidepressants and wipe my ass with toilet paper.
ESTC was the play today boys, not surprised.
PLTR $50c
AMD moving in an upwards direction finally
\>Get into LAZR

&#x200B;

after its gone up 100%? That's just asking to get burnt
I think how China plays the future will also have a big role on things roll out. They’ll be actively trying to weak the US economy. China is in a way state socialism, with the BoC giving countless amounts of loans so Chinese companies can buy everything from companies to real estate or whatever in west countries.

Got almost more game with my BABA than TSLA

Just saw someone comparing Moderna to Pfizer and thought the same thing.
This BA 2023 $300C I picked up a couple days ago should do just fine, I might go grab a few of his buddies before they go to the moon
Talking about it today voting tomorrow
Here comes the green and I didnt buy the dip.

This thing about being broke is kind of annoying you know
Yeah but the time was Monday, not now. Nothing is a good play if it's been a good play for a week (usually).
ah good
What’s good to invest into
thank you. I just need TSLA to climb to the 650 range. Doesn't need to go ITM or anything

The queen bee has been silent as of late and is making us all nervous
She passed out, I guess it’s the volatility...

GME is a graveyard
*sigh*

BofA what.
Truthfully I’m no expert but Air Canada employs 20000 people the govt will never let it go bankrupt. It’s also trading at historic lows so if even it crashes it will go up in a couple of years. I think it’s a good play

Does AMZN usually act like this all day?
Hi dumb tard question here. So if I set a limit price that means my options will sell once they’ve reached that number?
pull it hard bb
The issue isn't due to tradition of not being disruptive, it's that there is a greater emphasis on what you can do, not what you can imagine. The value of one's work is the product that they can produce.

The US has placed a lot of value on our inventors and designers, but we don't actually produce most of the products we invent. By continuing to outsource the production of our ideas, we create an environment in these other countries where reproduction is valued.
What you should do is buy stocks that are down but not bankrupt type. i would by hotels and cruise lines because holidays are coming up and those are big runs for them
Waiting for it to dip some more but im jumping in today

No I’m retarded too
So this delisting bill basically says they have 3 years to play by the rules before they can actually get delisted. Yeah I think I’m about to go all in BABA calls
I don't understand options yet, so I'm not sure. Sorry
Come on market do something

Bought 12/11 $26 PLTR calls yesterday purely on a hunch that it would bounce after such a down day. Sold at open for small profit. Sometimes even 'tards get paid

It's amazing, for cruise lines nothing seems priced in. Every vaccine pump triggers them.
Buy calls at the top, nice
This is me just investing what I have in broad index/high dividend funds.
I cant stop printing money with PLTR.  In at 11 out at 32, in again at 22.
Diamond hands
Actual question, when I sell a call I can use the funds to instantly buy stock etc? But I still have to wait t+2 to deposit in my bank account right?
was considering buying crwd yesterday. arghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Who really want to pay like 1000x next years numbers for a stock?
Old news. Oct 8 on CNBC.
😂😂😂
No one seem to care. They just look at the stonk price and compare it to pre-covid. I agree with you fully, the valuation right now is way too high. I've sold calls which I've had to cover for wayyyy to much imo.
So about that squeeze..
Terrible volume
Serious, ANOTHER day of BB selling off???  Fuck this game
Yeahhh I lose all but 4$ I invested in it
If Tesla ever gets above $600 I have no idea where it’ll stop, maybe the Moon
What was the premium you paid those calls?
That’s why you buy spreads (don’t ban me wsb)
Come on stock market! Move!
Well we need to have online access (secure) to our files or drawing repository as we often work with other sites on projects or team members remotely. Let’s just say, that IF we had “classified” information, then yes, we would store it on an old school type system with no external online access in a secure room (2-person integrity IF it’s being accessed). 

As far as ITAR, we just need to comply with them when shipping material goods internationally and we have our own ITAR “rep” that handles those things.

NIO calls?
Because the goal of fake isn’t to make a replica. It’s to make the shittiest possible product that someone will pay full price (or more) for. Where to you think the original shoes are coming from?
so that's it for tsla for today?  590 or below?
Till they are delisted. By the US govt.
Can’t wait to see the pltr gang losing everything

It is pure corruption. A cancer on our economic system and a vehicle for the ultra rich to make even more money. The market is not healthy.
Yeah I'll get in below $20
He may be early, but he's not wrong.
Yeah. I sold and jumped on CRSR
It's not up to the companies.  It's up to the Chinese government to allow the USA inspectors in.  
BABA, NIO, etc. already have auditors.  They're just not getting PCAOB inspections because of Teddy Ruxbin (Xi).
What’s the news?
Down 5:(

LAZR LETS MOOOOON
Bought BLNK, CRSR and PLTR stocks yesterday at dip. Make me easy $ please
in that case, yes the chineese must have launched something
Jet blue did a stock offering, and the stock is above where it was before the offering in one day. Those guys are smart because mfers are buying everything. 🤡🤡
Big money continuing to move into SRNE today.  6500 Jan $10 calls were purchased yesterday.

By way of relevant update, by Monday and Wednesday next week, respectively, is the FDA's deadline to approve their 2 newest clinical trials.

Monday is for the most potent anti-COVID antibody on the planet (which is why DARPA last week gave them $34 million to work on it for another project), and Wednesday is for the antibody in nasal drop formulation.

By way of illustrative example, the phase 1 trial for what I just called "the most potent anti-COVID antibody on the planet" literally consists of only 2 people.  This is real.

Want to change the world?  Get your COVID test, get nasal drop antibodies sent to your house the next day, and then get better.  That's the news I'm expecting by Wednesday.
PLTR stimulus talks going well
They're making a sequel to the big short called "the big mistake" featuring TSLA and Dr Burrys
Time to change to a new broker op

No of course not but I still think 250 is a long term floor for them once it gets sorted out. They're the biggest company in the dow. I'm holding shares from 100$ during the covid crash

Long term it will probably rise. But long term... Now, after the burn a lot of people are looking for an out to decrease their exposure to it. This +8% climb is a perfect opportunity to do that. I expect another big drop in the next few days.

I guess the GME train just straight up skipped the station lol rip
I guess what I am getting at is that you should never put it past rich, powerful people to find a way to maintain that power and wealth.  You're correct that a paradigm shift in terms of resources and currency is coming.  I'm just saying to bet on the incumbent (USA).

I used to own a bar with a couple of video poker slot machines.  This is 100% accurate.

Addicted gamblers would come in very low profile, do their daily things (losing it all) and leave incognito.  They wouldn't even buy a single drink because money is supposed to go in the slot machine, not anywhere else.  Once in a while they would hit like a 500$ gain and boy.... they were super loud about it and kind of cool.  They would feel so happy they would buy everyone around a drink and enjoy that little moment not gambling and just being happy about it.

Then after 30 minutes they would dump the gains into the slot machine and leave incognito again.

I enjoy WSB for the fun factor and the good humor floating around but I know deep inside a lot of kids are getting or are already addicted to gambling and somewhere down the road their life will be miserable.   That's something about WSB nobody really want to see or admit.
Thank you for flying PLTR 🚀
Good work retard. TARS should have been RH, In the movie "TARS, If I pass you take the reigns" could be "RH, If I pass out you put a stop loss order in."

Gotta make up for lost time. BABA GANG
Watching the VIX closely today. It seems to have stopped falling this week, and might start heading back up in advance of an index dump a la September 2nd.
Lets hear it bois BABA BABA BABA
Japan might be a good example and if so, then 4 years is very optimistic...Luckily though, there will always be exceptions.
That sounds good. I honestly think it hits 240 by end of next week.

Long calls are defo the play imo. Alas I'm in Europe so can only hold shares.
Bet you wont

Ahh yes. The 90 ban. A classic notification
Moderna flies on vacc news and pfe just sits. What a world.
i read the GS report on TSLA. they pretty much only talk about car sales and how they expect EV sales to go up in the future. no mention of any other tech really

so now TSLA is a car company (and not a magic future tech company)?   🤔
But the KR dip, free money

I cannot believe it
That’s what a wanted to hear. Strike and exp? Thinking Jan 240s
I'm sitting with my calls and hoping lol
We out here 🐝
I'm going to buy stocks
Bought the high right after they first split and had paper hands and sold when it was flat at 420 for months lol
It's taking a damn long time then. I think for stocks there has to be dilution before companies get that extra capital as well.
GoPro with a casual 18% gain over the week.
TSLA can't go over 600, because we all expect it to. But if we all know that then the big money should skyrocket it today when everyone is conditioned to sell at 595.
Probs options expiring
NIO created a forest fire just to trap the smokey ass bears in it.
Due to the fact that I smoke weed everyday I will be going all in on those sweet acb calls
NNDM get used to the name
I’m really surprised it’s taking them this long
Strike?
I said to get in like 10 times yesterday, were squeezin
cmon tesla rents due baby
Moderna gonna pump to 150 today. get in.
Pretty sure not. 

First I am not sure you are aware that the top 5 % of rich people in China don't work for the PLA. The students that are actually sent by the CCP to steal technologies would be military school graduates or PLA members, they would be trained in this type of espionage. Rich kids aren't. 

Also you should thank them. They are paying full tuition so that universities are willing to give financial aid. They are  subsidizing it for you.
Holding my oil bleeding calls, these diamond hands will pay off on monday when everyone rotates to black gold

Nclh pumping despite more cancellations because vaccine. How much room to grow?
Bueno I don’t have much of a choice anyways when YOU block ME 😒
BA dip looks juicy
because they are not making any profit on the vaccine
it fucking better!
APHA is  a fucking boomer stock
Just got into PLTR hopefully I don’t get fucked 🤣
I've never traded but I hate it just for the fact that it was pumped so hard prior to IPO.
Who bought the KR dip?
They need to just announce a stock split and do it.
I don't give a shit about anyone here but I hope people cut losses and take profits on PLTR.
bought a spy put

Just the algorithms doing they thang.
Also noticed that
What do you know, of course I have short /NG puts and its down over 8% when I wake up.
PFE why the sell off!!
whats your price prediction?
No pointy lines, only rockets 🚀🚀🚀
Hope u guys held/bought BABA
This post is so low effort and low quality that auto mod should have flagged and deleted. Nonetheless great analysis retard, have fun playing with 1 share
DKNG early sell off on Flutter/FanDuel news
Agreed. Why focus on PLTR when you can focus on PLTR?
Wow so you’re dumb and ignorant, not a good combination there fella
Fuckcktkhrr flat market Jesus fucking christ
Lol GME, I want to buy the dip but I’m afraid it’s going to keep dipping today
Apple WTF
I am such a pussy...I never hold calls long term. I sold my all my jan pltr calls with 30% gain this morning. I am still holding some March calls
Buying ZS $230c Dec18 lotto tickets
Never thought I’d say thank you to Goldman and Ball Sachs. 162% return on a Tesla weekly l randomly bought yesterday with intentions of day trading and someone decided to hold overnight.

For those of you that held on PLTR, now is your chance to abandon ship. Don't say you didn't get warned.

Cool thanks I was wondering if we'd have a lot of shareholders with 100 units.
At -96% you might as well stick it to -100%
this is why i only recommend boomer stocks like boeing to my friends.
We're November babies. You mean this isn't normal?
BuY tHe GME DiP gUyS, LiMiT SeLL $500 🤤
I'm sorry (not sorry) but I hope it doesn't drop that low
If you were to buy puts in addition to owning shares for GME wouldn’t that making MM’s short it and increase the % shorted making the epic squeze greater? Then if they’re long enough out they capture the collapse back to $0

I deserve to be fucked for paper-handing TSLA.
TSLA free tendies
Can someone please give this retard a medal.
I still have to recover from my NKLA calls.
Stable markets? Spy trading in a 50 cent range every day? Is this what we have to look forward to in the next 4 years? Sounds like the death of WSB. Rip option traders.
It’s been flat for months
Up 7.5% brah
Same with CHGG, tanked about 20% portfolio only two days after a phenomenal earning report 😎
JD and BABA about to have 5% days. If you aren’t in yet you are a fool
Wow, Robinhood has no shame about their place in the market. Even their sign-up bonus is a casino.
Bruh honestly they probably tanked it so they could start buying.
I must be as well
TSLA about to fucking explode!!! 📈📈📈

Because it's only for non established companies.
Upward momentum stalled. Here we go
Why clf open so flat? Fuck these green premarket bullshit
Let’s all hop aboard the PLTR and see what this puppy can do

They had us in the first half 🚀

i was gonna say something then i remember you're the salty NIO hater
Bought more in 32 so yes please let me have money back smh
i understand your viewpoint and i agreed with it for years,  but my experience has changed my mind. Seeking help and receiving a treatment has helped me so far. Is over-diagnosis a problem? Yes. Is the stigma against seeking treatment hurting people who are scared to ask for help? Also yes.

Seems ok baba seems ok now too lmao
Come back to this thread is 30 mins and see if there are any people pumping PLTR still
Yes
Would I be retarded to get some baba 260 puts right now
It’s barely down, pretty much flat. Or were you expecting a boomer stock to keep pumping several days in a row?
yah not the best opening unfortunately

https://ibb.co/BPcqBSM
it's bullshit is what it is
commence daily aapl pump and flat for rest of day

I’m not saying it’s a long term hold but this guy wants 50% and only stocks like this are that volatile.

How is the sell off so vicious on bby every single day. Jfc

You think it won't pass the house? What makes you say that.

SQ—yesterday nice dip :)
Crsr
anyone buying nio calls?
Semi diamond 💎 hands are cashing out of PLTR
Congrats PLTR bulls, you are now having a heart attack
There's no concept of market cap in the subreddit. Expecting apple and tesla to make 5 percent jumps like it's nothing and getting upset when it doesn't happen.
ah yes

BRK.B will dip more or buy in?
🍏 fake dump
Is the same big money is playing with CRSR and pltr? They have literally same movement the past two days.
Time to load up some calls
Look up the most recent WSJ article. I’m on my phone right now.
Let's be honest, if we all just dumped our money into SPY LEAPs and nothing else, we'd be in a much better position.
oh yea, otm calls will print. drop 15% yesterday. No way it drops further. it will rise a few bucks at least.
Wtf lol 😂

If there was such a thing as a perfect hedge that was guaranteed not to lose money, that fund would have trillions of dollars in it.

EDIT: Actually, there is a perfectly safe investment vehicle. US Treasuries at 30bps. That's the level of return you can expect from a $20T economic engine at 0 risk.
CHWY
Alright I’ll check in on you at eod and see how you’re doing. Wait until the autists find out it’s a holdings company and not the luxury brand they think it is.
I have my play money in RH and a "real" account I try to be responsible with. I do get a stiffy with my VOO dividends in that account.....

This is lame. I guess sideways all day until the last two hours like usual.
lame and honestly, gay, and not even in the cool way
another theta day lol
YOu mean for the past 19 minutes?
It’s one guy absolutely obsessed with shitting on PLTR. If he just bought the dip as often as he commentated on it, he’d be a millionaire now
[deleted]
Yeah I’d say so
Li?????
[deleted]
This sub is a meme machine. To the fucking moon, baby.
hey, stop lying to people
No cuz it’s 930-10
IV will also crush puts as well if that is your thesis lol. I just don’t understand why people giving much importance to earnings when Gamestop is likely to announce their roadmap plan to turn Gamestop into online retailer as demanded by Cohen.
Okay I wimped out and sold my 600c at 593. Hope it moons for everyone else with diamond hands! I am finally back to profit all time
I got uvxxy hedges
Was in on VALE for a while. Just sold my leaps last week for a measly 100% gain.

DR Burry closed his position Nov 30. 

It's over, you can go home now
PLTR might save Christmas for me
Am I ur dog
Here’s your emoji...🤡
Sell. This rise now is probably shorts covering and locking in their gains, and also gives a great opportunity for many people to abandon ship. There is a chance it will rise again, but later on, I expect another big dip first.
  
This is PLTR in the future:

*flashback to June 8*
Buying puts today 215 12/18
Up 9.25% at the open
I predict they will compromise something so 2 trillion dollars are not taken out of economy. For that reason, I'm in. Also perfectly ok for me to own these shares on HK exchange.
CRWD! That’s what I like to see
FUCK YOU RETARDS PALANTIR TO THE FUCKING MOON
You can trade options right now under the new ticker
LET'S GOOOOO!!!!!
my dog just shorted pltr
we buying SQ n CHWY here?
Never bet against the Mighty USA. I invest in PLTR, because I believe in the CIA and in America. Let’s go. 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Baba up 6.25 since open.
Congrats man
Just an FYI this is what the typical morning looks like for PLTR when it goes on a 20% ripper. Get in now.
Lol no
Sans breaking vaccine news, PFE is notorious for moving like a glacier. It's a safe, slow, reliable blue chip that kills options on either side of the coin.
I don’t think you realize... this isn’t just a few minutes of pain, it’s hours of pain and nausea with the risk of gastrointestinal distress and injury to your GI tract, could take days to recover fully if you chug the whole bottle. Maybe just a tablespoon is OK
LOL IV on TSLA is wild as hell.. Stock is up about $8 from where I bought my calls and they've barely gained anything.  And these aren't weeklies either.
Yes
Pltr dip get in ride to 25 !!
CRSR RIPPING
Great move. Lame ass boomer stock.
I didn’t hear no bell.

Positions: 2 lots @15.00 cost basis and sold a 15JAN21 26P for 5.13 credit.
This is the way
Tech dumps on good earnings, so up on bad earnings makes sense right?
With options I sell at 20% usually unless I have real belief in the stock
BA is now outperforming AAPL in my investing account
TSLA is looking like a +7% rocket today
Sell the straight lines buy the dip. Long as it stays above 1.80 we are wet today
8.3% now
CRSR is actually green... is the selling finally over?
Yes
You believe it was a conspiracy to indenture a number of countries experiencing aggressive chinese policy to China, spawned from the US, that Obama was touting as one of his greatest achievements? How deep down the far right rabbit hole are you man. That is so fucking stupid on so many goddamn levels, I feel bad for you. Why the fuck would the US do that, why would Obama want to do that, why would all of those countries sign on?
Safe to be back in PLTR and NIO?
is right now better than last week?
I just bought some airline leaps. I’m confident that one vaccines start getting distributed it’ll leap.
Yeah the trend of mooning every single day
Ez
🗣️CHWY PTON
PLTR Bull here but this community is honestly so short sighted. You guys react to to things so dramatically. PLTR opens up 4% for the first 20 mins and its "OH BEARS ARE FUCKED"...until it goes down 4%  and then the whole thread is selling. You retards remember monday morning? It did the SAME SHIT. idk im ranting PLTR 40 EOW
CRSR GANG
Everyone here forgot about ZS
Patience
Alright CRM come on let’s get a little pump going bud.
SNOW is a turd being propped up by rich hedge funds and their friends at ratings agencies who all have stocks they cant sell yet. This stock is the standard bearer of our current market. Fundamentals dont matter and rich people cant lose money. SEC doesnt exist.
On it. I'll let you know

Webull gave me some free Levi stock and it went up 15% before I realized it. I cashed it out and closed the account. I use TDA bitches.
Why yall didnt sell just to consolidate more profit/stock baffles me, you can stay in a  company long term and still look to make money short term. Edit- I cant spell words so idk why I'm even trying
PLTR, FREE MONEY
strike price?
My COTY free stock is up almost 200% since they gave it to me in September. $2.65 when I got it, $7.60 now.

If TSLA gets anywhere near 600 it’s going to bounce off so hard it goes through the earth
Friendly reminder that deep ITM SPY leaps have and always will be free money. If you’re young, they should be a staple of your portfolio
22 Was such a bargain, holy shit wish I had ammo for it.
CRSR MOONING BOYS DONT MISS THE FLIGHT
Careful of rug pull friends. VIX rising
if you buy an option at the end of the day and wake up to a 30% gain with an expiry a month out - do you take the money and run? whats your usually cut off point?
Next play: Thic🐝🐝 I am back bb
Except when -96.2% turns finally turns to -100%
Damn why do I keep missing the SR AC dip
My only guess is cuz it had like
Four green Days. It could still go green
Gotta be a pussy when playin with the only 1000$ i have to my name
I love this community. Buffett if you're reading. Plz get PLTR to 40
Holy shit. This PLTR cock riding thread. It’s everywhere 😟
Cuz they’re free 🤷‍♂️
These PLTR 12/4 40c are printing!
PLTR is not even close to the same as Google. It’s not worth $30 billion and I doubt it ever will be. 

Totally different TAMs
Buy the PFE dip, last call before it shoots up
PLTR you love to see it
BABA 😍
We'll find out today
You resub -> amzn announces its 1billionth subscriber -> tendies
12/4 pltr and nio calls....peak autism.
The pinstripes can only keep GME down for so long. Heavy resistance at 16
pltr shares  bought at 27.50... there's still hope in this world
S-R-A-C April 15$ calls and shares, FCX 1/15 24$ calls and a bunch of PLTR and NIO weeklys and calls before they fell.

What's TSLA ATH?

That’s a fair concern. But I’m going to hold today and see what happens.
Hell na
7.29 lo
It involves Tik tok doesn’t it
Never forget the cardinal rule: stonks go uppies
People are fucking trying, times are bad, there's no such thing as a specific trade or career that is guaranteed to make a lot of money that "anyone" could do, especially future-proof. "Common knowledge" means fuck all, give me specifics, for people under 40. Fuck, if you're actually good at this, you could start your own company selling job advice to retards. Who do you know that is actually well off after their military service? Let's say, even 3 years out? Some of the dumbest motherfuckers I've ever met when it came to finances, regularly met military people who'd taken out 30%+ interest loans for buying a 5k mixed breed puppy.

Thanks for your tendies 😂
Good joke retard

Also... all that being said. The best canna investment opportunities are not publicly traded or even otc for that matter.
Yeah, fidelity is forcing us to watch closely 24/7

Calls at close yesterday was such an easy fucking play
That’s really interesting. We shall see what happens
Simulation rigged, CHWY spiking after I get out
when is thicc bae gonna 🚀🚀😫
I'll say what I did yesterday -- keep an eye on TGT. This pull back from 180 last week may just be profit taking. Make no mistake it's been a top tier retailer this year and evolved the company in a way that will make it great in a post-COVID economy.

Pick a buy in spot for March calls (after Feb earnings which will include holidays). As long as they continue the trend of smashing earnings I think 200c is a good strike.
Sold my PLTR calls. +5k for the day

Also: Fuck you PLTR bears. Literally dumb dumb ty for gains

All those people telling all the PLTR traders i SaW tHiS cOmInG *in hindsight* yesterday are resorting to downvoting every post. I can see the tears.
Let’s make some green TSLA
I am naming my kids Elon & Alex
You think it hits 30+ by tomorrow?
anyone in AAPL? why is it going down?
Eli5
Ah you use RH? Lol. Well they’re going to continue to lose contracts in the air and see. It’s why it’s been getting beat for 2 years. Corona exasperated their problems. Don’t see recovery for 5 years if ever.
It is but thats why patience and DD is needed
Can we get a show of hands on those who FOMO’d into PLTR just now?
Read the bill.
Doesn't affect them, their auditor is already registered.
Y'all should have known 22 was pltr bottom. Some firm bought like 30mil stock at that price a few weeks ago

Shh...don't tell these retards about our baby
Cmon apple are you serious ?
Guys, I don’t understand why we are giving much importance to Q3 earnings, if our thesis is Gamestop turning around to become online retailer as suggested by Cohen? Shouldn’t just one announcement from Gamestop that they are going to focus on online retailer and more partnerships be sufficient?
TSLA do your thing
NIU
Honestly I bought some 11/12 puts. Earnings always causes things to go negative, even when they are above expectations. 

As great as it was for gaming during quarantine, most people didn't start spending until government subsidies kicked in. For many Canadians that was already end of Q2. Switches in Canada were impossible to come by, we had LOADS of store closures and they took some pretty large hits.

Now there is no stock to sell for PS5s because they are sitting on scalpers. This cycle has DIGITAL ONLY consoles which means EB and Gamestop have way less incoming game sales. And with all the scalpers having stock of PS5s you are going to sell less game sales early on compared to console sales.

Sorry retards. I'm betting against you. Especially since volatility is at an all time high going into earnings after a huge pump.

Please remember not to off yourselves at large losses.
[deleted]
Oh yesss LAZR all over my face bby mmmm
tesla is still going to dip a bit, but then it is going to gain retard momentum towards end of today or most likely friday. Safe bet to do a jan 600 call because China cant fuck us over on this one. Once Tes goes over 595 or is leading up to it hard, i will buy calls.
Why are PFE calls so cheap when all of America is getting their vaccine in the next 10 days lol something seems weird

i take Adzenys everyday and have been for around 2 months? and i just feel like i can finally get a litte bit of shit done but i definitely don’t feel a high or anything, and the “come down” for me is just getting a little hungry at the end of the day, what does it feel like for you ??
2% for small e-com CC is a competitive rate. The $299/m SHOP plan includes 2.4% for SHOP payments (stripe backend). But if you go with a different payment processor, you have to pay 0.5% in extra fee to SHOP + give up some fraud screening features. Makes it expensive to leave.
Lucky for y’all. It’s day 2 of the DKNG sale!

I guess Costco was a sell the news event should’ve seen it coming 😔

Well boys, I was kinda hoping for another red morning to pick up more PLTR at 20. We'll see how the rest of the day goes.
Imagine being the retard that thought, one more day, before picking up calls. Damn.
NIO calls?
I have 30c 3/19/21, I should be fine and hold right...
BABA still has a lot of room to go up, don’t miss out

In my last post I called myself ["Andrew Cargainie"](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/k4ms0x/call_me_andrew_cargainie/) and people responded with "I don't get it," and "This isn't PLTR, why is it green?" But now I would like to request the flair "737 MAX profit" or something equally autistic.
tldr, fd's return bigly, if right
You were saying?
What did he say?
Oh, oh, where my ‘PALADINS’ attttt 🚀 🚀
BABA please keep the dildos up
lmfao @ those doubting PLTR yesterday
paper mario hands lmao
PLTR bears who thought it would keep drilling every single day after a string of red days are just as stupid as PLTR bulls who thought it would keep mooning every single day after a string of green days

Reversion to the trend, you retards

That’s why you cash out slowly. It’s options, take some cash when you can. I don’t expect a crash but even like a 10-15% correction on the right time can kill them.
I'm bullish

PLTR to da moon!
NIO is back and going back to 55+ soon as we shake the paper Mario hands
SWBI

Earnings at close today. Entry point is now
How good is this jobless data?
Nothing, it’s overvalued af. But there aren’t a million analysts shorting it so I’m guessing they already have shares
An option with a break even of +3% from current price.  A deep ITM call is much safer than buying a slightly OTM call if you like not potentially losing the entire value of your option at the cost of less profits but greater security.
Yes NEW ATH
Lol
Weed to the MOON after the vote. Average joe gonna hear about the vote on the news tonight and every pleb gonna be spending their paychecks on weedstocks tomorrow.

What if I have shares only?
Up CRSR!! UP!!!
Pretty close, according to robinhood :

 “ There is an approximately 98% chance of the stock bonus having a value of $2.50-$10, an approximately “1% chance of the stock bonus having a value of $10-$50, and an approximately 1% chance of the stock bonus having a value of $50-$200, based on the price of shares at the time of purchase. “
Yes unquestionably
PLTR is mooning. Diamond hands paying off
Spy’s gonna print, and I’m about to buy the fuck out this apple dip just waiting for the bottom
It will
Why is AAPL always dumping at open?
It’s been like that for the last 3 months or so, even though it would slowly get back. Who tf would dump just to buy back?
Lmao retards that bought puts pltr
PLTR bears are as delusional as Ellen Paige.
Great effort. Just in time to kick the bears in the balls!
Because they are a good company who said they plan on complying
So stimulus checks cost 290b for one time. They'd rather put 500 billion into fraudulent ppp loan programs than continue to provide critical support for Americans.

whats the play for dxy going to shit?

PLTR to the moon
PLTR to ground control....we have lift off.
They don’t offer options and I am pretty sure most people know what Rolls Royce does.

Been doing this since public offering. Gains always sell off hard. Either take profits on weeklies or play leaps
Got a boner
So many sell orders just taken out on PLTR. Clear sailing ahead boys
500 to 20K aint happening any time soon.

500 to 2 will probably happen.

Welcome, 

Youre a day late on PLTR's second bull run. 
TSLA is being added to the S&P later this month.
PFE still has room to run on US approval news.
ABNB IPO is cumming. 

Just remember, first one is free.
That is correct
Picks for today are roku, square, and beyond meat.
If you’re still unsure, buy shares of PLTR now and hold them for 2-3 years. If you’ve been losing on calls, try this play and you’ll get 10x return guaranteed by 2023.
They have 3 years to comply.  Doubt it will affect many.
RIP to everyone who got played by the PLTR MMs 😂😂😂😂😂😂
We gonna ride

NKLA needs to hit 0 already
I don't know who needs to hear this, but you're a retard.

Imagine selling PLTR at open 🤡🤡🤡

After hours and Pre market >>>> day trading
I love how your comment being the obvious most intelligent response is default collapsed as though you have negative downvotes. 

Interesting
Source?
Small green candles then huge red dildos down
**FUCK**
If pltr closes above $55 on 12/4 I’ll eat my own feet 

Mods!!
If everyone is selling nio to buy TSLA, I'm ok with that
nio eod predictions?
[deleted]
Why are all the numbers on my stock website green, is that good
my calls are so long dated its nice not having constant heart attacks from small drops but kinda boring
Hold on bitch to 30
Shhhhhhh don’t fucking jinx it
I think we re going to max pain at 26.
Hell yess let’s change modern medicine 🧬🚀
PLTR looks better in green 😌
Plz explain I am frustrated
1.5k to 20k in one month?
Yeah it’s a rollercoaster rn. My $30 calls are holding their ask price tho. I believe today will be a Green Day just be patient
1364
🌈🐻 messing everything up
After losing most of my gains since Friday, today is redemption. Clawed my way back buying dips yesterday and it feels good.
🐝???
My butthole is so clenched for NIO
Fuck zscaler, shit doesn't work and I get cucked at work for it
Can X just please give it to me already?
NKLA to either $0 or $100, there is no inbetween
Do i sell my PLTR now, im still at a loss but its a much better loss than it was yesterday
[deleted]
BABA GANG, time to make up some losses
aapl 125$ EOY easy money
So glad I bought the dip on PLTR yesterday, fucking right.
But SPY to 370+ before it corrects. LEZGEDDIT
We sellin lazr now or what
didn't know government was a race...
Oh boy have I missed this. PLTR 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
[deleted]
Inconceivable.
[deleted]
You could sell 35C’s against those calls if you want to reduce cost basis, but ultimately it’s up to you. The best long term play is probably going to be shares.
No volume on GME. Everyone go buy your shares and this will 🚀
explanation for DKNG?
that was a homage to him, good catch
You bought calls didn’t you?
Trevor's about to take a fat dump
🥜 calls are printing!
PLTR gang is it time to sell?

Retard
[deleted]
Sometimes it ain't right but you gotta do what you gotta do
PLTR  cannot be doing this
I lost it at huge Shrek dildos
You haven’t heard? PLTR 40c 12/4 BBY🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🦍🍆🍆🍆🍆🍆
Thanks! I held, but I’m still not convinced it will work. I wonder if the MMS are suppressing the price somehow so it can be added cheaper as the S&P inclusion. Theta on one of my calls is like 1.3! I’m nervous but planning to hold the horns on this bucking bull.
Thank god I didn’t listen to you guys and sell PLTR
Hope you retards bought that NIO dip
"HUGE SCHREK DILDOS!"
LOL someone made a huge dump 5s before open.
RMG should be next
Just buy PLTR and you win at life
this market insane boring
Same in Germany, a company i worked at had a few exchange students over from China with a teacher. You can bett that the teacher made photos of almost everything in the first half of the first day. Later they took his camera and delete everything. He was not over again...
Oh brother. Market just opened. Give it time. Looks like a pump to me... that 20% isn’t yours until it’s in your bank account.

I've seen people get mixed up with where and wear, but never fucking we're. You truly belong here. PLTR to the moon.
Bought in on PLTR at 31.39 and 28.24, I only have 13 shares

Exactly long term calls, you could make money.
[deleted]
BABA is back! Daddyyyy
I missed the last pump on crsr. Should I buy in today?
PLTR gang again
If TSLA goes to $600, I will eat a brownie from Starbucks.
Only other thing is boeing😂
> Do research. Read, for crying out loud. Look at earnings reports. Take everything you hear with a grain of salt. Slow and steady money is much better than losses, so act like it. I'm honestly disappointed in how some of you guys have been acting. 

lol that guy is such a cuck. I wonder why didn't he follow his own advise when buying Palantir at ath.
Now I’m kicking myself not getting another 500 shares of pltr yesterday after it drop below 22, well at least got the 500 below 23. Might never see this number again.
GME has shit volume thou, hell's that
Weed stocks never seem to carry a 2 day momentum. Idk why I never see this coming
Buying zscaler 3 months ago paid off
BABA finna pump 270+
To day trade and swing, is it better to buy ITM or OTM calls ?
We getting rigged up in here
daily aapl morning dip
Wow, SNOW was like, fuck you.
It won’t last. This piece of shit won’t hold green. What the hell is happening. Is someone constantly shorting?!!!!
Lol idiot was wrong and then more idiots lost money cuz they followed a sheep off the clip for $AMD
You were led wrong. You'll  lose that 500  as a down payment
Bro, I’m running low on patients with this stock. Should be $3600 already.

It's gonna bounce
everyone sayying nio will bounce up but why?
nah mang
Good play
Piece of shit MMs dump Apple every fucking time ar open. This piece of shit
also, it's not my theory but it looks too coincidental to ignore.  see this thread: https://stocktwits.com/rottyguy/message/260975854
SQ is bipolar af lately..
Chinese EVs are currently only listed in the US, so if they are delisted you can't buy or sell them anymore. Other chinese companies like Alibaba at least have listings in HK so you could conceivably buy/sell on in HKs market.

It's 3 years to comply, but the chinese government has been impeding regulatory compliance since 2013 and supposedly make it a law that international regulators can't force compliance for "states secrets" reason.

Spy 370 today??? PLEASE.
Otm >30dte. Itm is gay as hell
Paper hands will offload their PLTR calls so quick but NOT ME. I’m ready to get my heart broken again

Okay
This market is a clown🤡 literally can’t afford red days and a quick 1200 check

Diamond handing my 12/18 oil calls that are bleeding while everyone else is making money on real stonks
I'm holding 12/18 40.5C  because I feel like vaccine news isn't in full swing
 Drill BKNG. Drill to fucking $2000. This shit is so overvalued. It keeps fucking going up even with the downgrade.
The last time Cramer talked about Palantir, the bears attacked it. It's currently on a bounce, it's like he is giving a nod... but to who, to retail or his old fund chums ?  


\*puts on tin foil hat to work out the Cramer code\*
RSI is extremely oversold
Phenomenal

Lol @ people still playing PLTR weeklys. Y'all gon LEARN. Buy ITM > 30dte!
Done 😎 let's get RICHHHHH 🤑🤑🤑
It doesn't have to have a pump to be profitable, just steady gains and this one will over time. There are other traders on the market besides this sub lmaoo.
PLTR space ship mode 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
TSLA putting the burners on
And this is why I don’t want to touch NIO
Every day this sub speaks to more and more. This not okay.
i was thinking the same smh
Shouldn't my max loss overnight be theta? If IV and price are the exact same? Right now I'm seeing 2.5x theta drops overnight.
Holding for the rest of the day and then im fucking off for a week or two. Im getting my asshole gaped
MY BOY TSLA GONNA RUN TODAY!
Check it now
We could do that without an entity if we held majority voting power
INTC with their partnership with Amazon on AI
BBY will likely rise $5-10 by EOY. Media will report strong holiday sales, get in now boys 

12/24 $111c
Strike
I keep trying with Corsair. I can scalp about few hundred dollars but I want to have a day like NIO did yesterday. It won’t happen but if it hits 28.90 we could see some good demand
I’m not right 100% of the time, but they’re are a lot of autists in here pumping it and don’t even know what the company does. Should’ve made an options play and cashed out. If you hold that stock I still believe you’ll lose on it or stay stagnant.
Tesla let’s break that 600 wall
Robinhood telling me I have an account deficit of $0.00 and I can't make trades. Very cool.
FUCK YOU CORSAIR!!!!!!!!
i dont understand im boomer so lets call it "meme" stock

Murica with the initial dump as always
TSLA BULLS, HOLD THE FUCKING LINE!
I keep refreshing my screen expecting to see a giant dump, for some reason PLTR looks like its up about 5%. Must be some kind of mistake
240 you fuck
APHA whatchu doing BB I’m tryna be rich here
BABA 265 here we go
BNTX go green bb
I definitely considered this, I took my puts out for 1/15/21 just in case. But I think it would be worthless to pass the bill in the house in this state. Its just a DOA, and if it passes McConnell will just rush it anyways before the election. He has the power. He DEFINITELY will not take that risk, you know that guy. I think its possible people sober tf up and vote nay today/tomorrow.
Oil stocks gonna moonnor die?
There goes the rug
Wow Cramer is literally talking to us directly
10 to 10:30
Her mac 'n cheese is really good, ngl.

Is XPEV AND NIO DISLISTING OR WHAT?
my BA 6/18/21 $500C  I bought back in Feb are only down 57% now. We can do this BA.

Technically it no longer applies after that 12k gain lmao
Amd will probably reach 100 soon by some stocks
Nioooo wtffff I trusted u again
TO THE FUCKING MOOOOON PLTR TSLA LETS GO
lol i kno rite
It's usual dipping shit after open on a bad day
I give PLTR 15mins before it starts tanking into oblivion.
Amazon calls??
The way it should be
It goes down ever mourning than goes back up in the first half hour
ban for retardation
yea saw that too
What if the market just stagnates and SPY trades in the 360s for 5 years?
hahah.  don't thank me yet.  let's hope it plays out but this recent runup oddly lines up with their last ath run up 18mo.  almost to a tee.  it's scary how close it has been this week actually.  if you have access to charts, compare starting with last monday to 2/22/19 and track the days and see for yourself.
There was no fiasco
BB reversal upwards incoming after hitting 7.25
Lol
Ok so who’s buying this nio dip ? It could be an easy day trade like yesterday
PLTR to $24 EOY!
[deleted]
Since Burry is under 5% ownership for GME, he can sell his entire position without reporting.

Y'know what? He likely did sell to buy TSLA Puts.

GME $9 EOY, Take Profits While You CAN!
Bought 4 pltr 22c yesterday for 1 sold today for 2 😎
PLTR to the fkn moon boys
#pltr is not going over $26 for the next 2 weeks. MM will not let that happen.
SQUADE I LOVE U
Holy shit
This quarter and the last.
Wat do you suggest. Time?
pltr come back to me please. i don’t like when we fight
12/18 GMHI 17.5c  🚀
BABA back BB
Not enough meme strength. It’ll be a slow ride
whaaaat that's crazy.  

I guess I get it, peppering a share or two of a more valuable stock makes the "free stock" incentive a little more enticing.

But now I also wonder what the distribution of free stocks look like, 99% <$5 and 1% ~$200?  would be an interesting thing to know
4AM traders are the real market movers
Let’s shit the bed today too CRSR! Let’s shit it all the way to 0 you piece of shit!!

your guess is as good as ours
Maybe another 30 seconds. Maybe.
this slaps though.
Sir, I was under the impression that DD can be written in non-formal way. The things I have written are no “stream of consciousness”. Am I doing something wrong?
Kanga gang it is
.... wtf is wrong with SPY? What is this volume for ants and blood flat for 2 days?
Imagine how stupid you have to be to buy anything at 9:30am. What a noob
Tesla let’s show them what you got

“You made money. We don’t like this.”
Fuck it he just made 12 g’s
Every morning nio falls off a cliff only to recover by midday
I don’t even know what PLTR does but these calls are printing.
Technicals shows this is going down to $15
So NIO is going to be delisted then or?
nio taking its scheduled morning dump. get ready to buy the dip.
Nice DD, bought a few puts for january.
CRSR is not a meme!!! CRSR lives matter, let it live.
Where are my GME and PLUG bulls?
I’m sorry but I love to see BB tank
Paper hand retards selling NIO again

Sell out of pltr make your profit and buy the dip again
Same like 69% of us here bro
~~why does AAPL DO THIS~~

edit: nvm we good
Ohhh just bought my GME put back for a decent profit and now I get to sell another after this dump finds the bottom 🤑🤑
Yep, he should have landed and been like "oh, just 13%?"
Anyone see that bid on AMD? Over $1mil worth of AMD at $93
how I miss those 10% TSLA days
🥱 going back to sleep
BA with the strength of a million boomers
BLNK to $30
I bought gmhi at 17 sold at 14 bc retarded and this morning they are lazr and trading at 23 fucking dollars!!!!!! Feels bad man
Ironically enough Nio is digging it's way back to china.
NIO dumping hard
[deleted]
Didn't Tesla fall 9% on great earnings and incredible margins this quarter?
Short term nio puts anyone?
-14% week, +500% month.
thanks i worked hard for it
Not as big as pre turkey day, market needs to gain confidence that we still run this shit.
Nah this premarket seems just too good to be true
you want the stock to rise 100% in the next two days..? they gotta discover a cure for cancer in the next two days
Pltr don't do this to us. After all we've been through and stayed with you
TSLA 💎💎🖐 IT IS THEN
[removed]
SPY opened at nearly the same price as last night's close. The IV on my puts didn't change beyond 0.05%. Theta is about $11 yet each option opened nearly $25 down from yesterday's closing. What gives?! Noticed the same thing yesterday too.
jack off. check charts. smoke weed. repeat.
Lol. Crash for me Nio, crash baby
Fuck I knew I should have waited for BNTX to dip
NIO why
I think your 🚀 is crashing.
NKLA dropping
SHOP heading to the stratosphere
Is NIO going to dip or not

GME currently going down like your mother so I hope you’re having a good market open.
Yeah!!
PP Hands
24 and change currently
BB sucks
[removed]
LMAO I love how consistently LLY shoots up on open just to bleed the rest of the day again.
I was just teasing. One of my accounts is Vanguard. It’s blessing in disguise. I rarely open it because it’s so lame & outdated  ... and it’s the most profitable account. It’s buy and hold account.

Robinhood is so exciting, I check and mess with it every 30 secs,  and it has the worst return ...
I hope you will upgrade to a mansion
CRWD to the moooooon 🚀🚀🚀🚀
NIO has really been blowing me
It was definitely fake. His demo account notice popped up during the "trade".

Remember this next time someone tells you WSB was better during some previous time. There was 3-5 DD posts a day and they were just as retarded as they are now. There were fewer traders, and there was bullshit like this even if it was funny.
PLTR boys never lose 😈
I guess Citron and MS got their friends up to speed and nicely positioned for the run now

ITM alert
TESLA such a cock tease AH. When is it going to take off to 630
PFE wtf?
Classic Nio straight line down at open

What to buy today boys?

Market gonna go red it’s Thursday idiots
Oh GME.... why do you have to be like this? Join your friends in the skies
SPLK FD puts would be 100x returns    😢
If I’m up 40 percent on Jan 21 2020 leaps should I just hold em.
Word thank you
Premium + Strike is the breakeven. You probably should've just bought the 100 shares.
Top is in
JdD running
GME stepbro what are you doing?

600 too strong man
But.....for how long?!
[deleted]
Fuck you APHA
Do it we in this together
Rode the initial dip and sold out at $7.9, missed out on about 10% at the peak. Bought for $2.7 yesterday, so I'd say that's an acceptable selling point.
Probably yeh, lmao
 Don’t want to hear it
Thanks. first time making a meme. caught random inspiration last night and spent the last 5 hours making this. Probably should have fine tuned it but I was tired af lol
Who cares, less IP controls more innovation, more meme stocks
People on this sub are so far gone but are also the funniest humans on this planet.
PLTR finally launching 🚀
I’M NOT FUCKING SELLING!
NIO is so retarded
Here is the manufactured Apple dip
Recession over?
The market only goes up. The country is on fire with covid, 2-3 thousand people are dying a day, my hospital is drowning in covid, everyone with cash is spending it on Chinese crap on Amazon, but the market only goes up. Ok. - Exasperated bear
I love the pattern day trader ban at the bottom of this.
Robinhood never gave me any of my free stock, so you're winning.
Biden doesn't have the authority to shut down a fucking thing. You already know Florida, Texas, etc. won't shut down
69.42
ADBE mooning
NIO/Xpev ;(
Bounces sound like money to me
I bought calls at the top diamond hands

How funny were all the gay bears yesterday looking down on PLTRtards. Were ya at now bears? imagine not buying the dip yesterday.

Fuck Shitron.

🚀
watching this has actually upset me. A bunch of analysts this morning gave upgrades to it. Somebody is paying them. This stock is the most corrupt thing ive ever seen.
To those of you who bought the dip, I salute you!
what? u got puts?
Up 20 percent on it😂 good thing you cant short RYCEY
GME rocketing down
thank god I've been bag holding that for MONTHS
367 bein a real sloot
lmao SNOW is actually up 5% now? These fools are smoking some strong af crack
Oh then he has nothing to worry about.
My only regret is that I was too poor to have bought more Tesla calls.
Buy
The 10% it’s up at open doesn’t matter if it’s a penny stock or blue chip. I’m still up 10% on it.
obligatory pltr to the moon!!!
This is your Tesla dip
You’re welcome palantards, I sold yesterday
We need another 6% day

Actually I can't afford Barron's so I didn't read that one 😏

Berkshire Hathaway probably....I saw a screenshot of someone getting the b class a little while back
I've seen this run by PLTR before. I'll wait till I see if it can hold through people taking profit before I celebrate.
Because it crashed due to morons and is now headed back to where it should be...$60+
You're doing a good enough job of that on your own.
Cue me running away from family and friends after promising them hookers and blow with Palantir...
JD rising
you guys are getting too excited about PLTR too early, you aren't safe yet don't jinx it. good luck tho
Damn NIO,  who hurt you? Was it the house? The senate?

Lol.  You think there is a chance of a 232 to 197 house won't pass the more act for show?  That is truly retarded.  What will happen is that it will pass and the congress will go into recess for the rest of the year.  It won't make it into the senate.  Then we won't sort out Georgia's elections until January which could, possibly, but not likely make the senate 50/50 with Kamala Harris as the tie break.  Its unlikely that it passes the Senate ultimately on this attempt, but it will 100% pass the house and give us a month of optimism in the market for canna stocks.  Its a good idea to dump them and/or take short/put hedge positions before the Georgia special election though.
My God I’m green at open

Hello survivors
Fake news was the only thing 🥭 was right about
Sure, it's still technically gambling, but there are bets you can make that give you far more outs and will still make you a good amount of money. 

I think it just kills the mood for me when people post losses and you can tell they had nowhere near the risk tolerance to do what they did.  I don't disagree with any play, no matter how insane, if it can blow up on you without destroying your life.  I love this sub and it's a good time, but some people seem like they really shouldn't be here.
They’ve been buying online. And we’re during lockdown.
CRWD 200 EOD
Selling a PLTR 44c for 12/4 was the easiest $100+ I made in my life, still can’t believe some moron instantly bought it
PLTR LET'S FUCKING GO 40P 12/11!!

everyone going broke on PLTR and not getting rich on PSTH.
Just said fuck it and went yolo on 12/4 googl calls, wish me luck
I guess I don't get who is waiting until ATHs to put money into the market
We have to clear 368 first.  But as those calls come ITM the delta gets higher and higher and the MMs themselves will be buying shares to hedge.

You’re right, that survey isn’t super accurate. I’m retarded enough to own 19,000 shares but didn’t participate in the survey. I’m looking forward to the Q4 results being announced early next year though.

>That's a very simplistic way to summarize everything

How? America are clearly the bad guys in 2020, Vietnam, Iraq, Afghanistan, Chile, funding terrorist groups to fight other terrorist groups, lying about WMDs to invade, killing mostly civilians with their constant drone strikes (95 pervent to be precise) and so much more

> I can tell you're extremely uneducated on the subject. 

How lol, because I'm against American foreign policy? 

>The media pushes every thing you just regurgitated.

They literally don't, almost every american media company regurgitated CIA propaganda, hell the new York Times even sent their paper to the government for approval of some stories and 90 percent of us media is owned by 6 coporations. They all repeat the exact same stuff, remember Iraq? If you were against the war in the early days you were literally publicly ostracised by the media, almost every main media station was complicit in pushing the war, it was disgusting to view. Americans became such psychos that Micheal Moore was booed off the stage at the oscars for disagreeing with Bush and the war

CNBC: reports that jobs numbers are improving and continuing claims have declined significantly 

CNN: only highlights 712k job losses and tells us how high it is and how we need the stimulus. No mention of previous job losses, improvement week over week or mention of continuing claims.

Only did shares, but I'm already out. Will buy more if it retreats, volume has been good and the stock has been very volatile. Saw some posts of people buying 20c and 22.5c 12/18 almost two weeks back, so anticipating some good gain porn from this one.
With 40 billion car buyers, there's plenty of room for all. Nio has been coming up for a while and they have the battery swap thang. Next year? $100+ When? who knows...

LETS FUCKING GO 🚀
WHAT IS YOUR FUCKING $APHA POSITION
They not gonna let pltr raise for two weeks. You guys planning to buy calls be careful
Oh I understand completely.  I had to build up my bank roll, mostly by selling TSLA puts before they increased the required collateral to enter those positions by 200%.  My goal was to control hundreds of TSLA shares as I think it will be the cornerstone of monthly income generation.  Got two Teslas so far from the profits.  

Just keep your eye on the prize, cut losers, take profits, stick with your own trading thesis.  My first “big loss” (at the time it was big for me) was closing a Tesla Put for a 2k loss; if i followed my original train of logic on that trade I would have actually made thousands on it but I traded emotionally.   As much as I’d love to have the balls of some of the people on here betting tens of thousands on weeklies, I just can’t play the lotto like that.  Slow and steady is my method.
Yeah you’re right

I've owned a deep otm leap for like 4 months and it has steadily climbed. No spikes. I think that means it's going up regardless of the news

I’ve been scouring the internet looking for anything but only found news of a different merger with a transportation company. Maybe something pops up today though. Either way they’re running out of time to make an acquisition

12/4 calls

I mean if you want real advice stay away from here unless you’re looking to gamble. Buy and hold on companies you use and have faith in. Stay away from options. Don’t make decisions out of fear and don’t be afraid to go against the grain if you have reasoning behind why that may be. Anyone telling you with certainty what a stock will do is lying. I come here mostly to find what to short, people here want to get rich fast and it’s not sustainable.
Here comes that volume...

just look at the 100 years chart,  stonk only go up.

If you buy LEAP call on SPY,  you can't lose, EVER.   It's fact.
If you're scared, roll out your calls a month. None of the retards here talk about it, but you can pay like 40 dollars × contract to extend the date 2 weeks

 If I’ve learned anything from NIO is to not panic sell calls at morning dumb and rather double down for extra tendies
PLTR gonna fuckin shoot at open
🍏🍏🤠🍏🍏 time to ride the bull
I agree and I'm in the same boat, but I still try to follow rule #1 whenever possible.  The problem with investing detached from fundamentals really only becomes apparent when you start losing money.  

I like to keep my decisions simple for sanity's sake.  If I think a share is worth $50, I buy it for $40, and it tanks to $18, there's no stress.  There's some annoyance because, while it presents a major buying opportunity, of course it would have been much better to enter at $18.  But other than that, there's no panic or concern unless something has changed.  But if your reasoning for valuing it at $50 is shaky, or non-existent, that makes your life a hell of a lot more difficult.

20% YOY might seem lame to a lot of people, and admittedly is when your portfolio is small, but once you work your way to $100k, $200k, etc. and really get the ball rolling, it doesn't seem as silly.  It took me a long time to grow my account and that was definitely annoying, but had I started gaining momentum and got obliterated on a series of bad high risk plays, I would have been far more pissed having to start over.

I gamble in casinos and in the stock market.  I don't see a problem with that, but no collection of pure bets should seriously rattle your portfolio if they go to hell.  At least in my opinion.
Hell no.
Eh it drilled to the core yesterday so a bounce was likely.

Lol. Were you living under a rock during the rise of the iPhone? Apple’s stuff have always been about user experience. It just works was heavily pushed as their thing for years and years. They took over the smartphone market by offering something better and marketing it properly, and it was affordable to millions. 

Tesla’s aren’t affordable to millions. There’s way more makers out there that have the status, the design, and actual quality control when compared to Tesla. In fact, they have already begun to drink Tesla’s milkshake. We’re on the brink of an EV revolution indeed: nearly all automakers will have several EVs on offer by the end of 2021. All will compete in niches Tesla can’t offer a product. And in the ones Tesla does, they will bring way more to the table. This revolution won’t be led by Tesla.

It also helps that theres multiple ways to turn it into a job.
Even under the best assumptions people aren't going back to theaters until summer.

Then you have the dearth of films in the can ready to be released.

It's a solvency game. So you have to ask yourself if you think they really have enough capital to last that long.
Some retards think we own enough of GME to cause this to happen (Unlikely). Others believe that some bigger players who have more at stake are banking on this. Others are just retards who love to jump on a hype waggon.(Most of WSB)
CRWD for the win
good luck everyone who is playing stocks increasing in value and wants to see others prosper instead of having their lives destroyed by a stock tanking

Yes
Saying this 3rd day in a row - I expect a rally in FAANG + MSFT/INTC stocks to catch up with others. Coin is also pointing upward. I suggest buying tech calls for next Friday (or for Jan) for mega cap. +5% strike from current for weekly, +10% for monthly option. Watch VIX carefully if things are to change along the way.

That's a risk call you'll have to make.  I only play shares cause I'm LT.  If you go short term calls, buy it out to Feb or Mar since it'll also cover their Q4 ER which should be good given they bought out 100% of their JV in november and will be able to incorporate nov/dec sales.  Q1 er will have 100% PSF (the JV) but that er won't happen til May.  If you want to YOLO buy dec 10 or 11 if price is good on any dips.  GL

I will take a flat day over what’s happened this week.
AMC  filed for the sale of up to 200.0 million Class A shares. Based on Wednesday's stock closing price of $4.32, the offering could be worth up to $864 million, which compares with AMC's market capitalization of $593.5 million. AMC said it may sell the shares from time to time, in one or more series or issuances, and on terms that will be determined at the time of the offering. The company said it had 85.6 million Class A shares and 51.8 million Class B shares outstanding as of Oct. 30.
It’s tough so am I same exact strike an date
let's get $25 PLTR
No, it's theft, so fuck you

Yeah I've been in for weeks and I'm not really sure how they make money.  Just in for that parabolic chart.  Good luck
It's pretty obvious that post inclusion there will a lot of "traders" at all levels dumping their positions leaving the core "investors" holding long.  From there will be a slow and steady (spiky at times) growth back ATHs as long as tsla keeps executing.
because it worked... for a while :(
CRM WAS OBVIOUS BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
Shiiiet dude that’s just the reserves for doubling down on the calls!
Holding calls but I’m just being real based off the past green opens
😓😥
Where do we genuinely think pltr will finish today? +3%?
May the tendies rain down on you all
Needs to break 380 to go down. Right at fib retracement just like yesterday. We hit 400 and bounce up I bet
Did you hold?
yeah what exactly is going on
Buying CRM yesterday was free money.
TSLA gonna dump hard at open
If you don't jump on LAZR IPO this morning, you hate money. I got in yesterday afternoon $15 when it was GMHI, and it's already at $22 this morning under new ticker LAZR.
We need like our own options version of the LOIC. Where it buys a shit ton of calls and drive the price up.

If SoftBank can do it why can’t we?
excellent
Trying to 💎🙌 my TSLA 12/18 $600c as long as possible, maybe roll to 12/24 or Jan
18,463
But this one is shaped like a cube.  A cube!!
hello, I am from the future. I bought 1000 PLTR and now I'm 2072 rich bitch.

yes.
Today
CRM 12/31 250C exit strategy? sell some today from FOMO buy ins or hold
Shhh
Hey, $AAPL, have some fucking mercy? I sell a covered call and you decide to bust through my strike the following day. At least come back down by close so I can buy back my call for a profit.
If the past few days are any indicator and you're playing options weeklies, sell that shit at open. You will probably miss out on a few hundred, maybe a grand, but it's better than losing. TSLA has been doing this stupid AH pump lately and then going to shit during the day, destroying options. If you're just playing shares then it's up to you, but the same thing applies in that it'll most likely dump 10+ points between open and 10am.
Bought calls yesterday.

Buying 400c at the open!
yes
Yes, but as you said anyone else can as well. It won’t be ‘unique’ or monopolistic to USA; the petrodollar has worldwide influence to America and to USD, which also helps suppress extreme inflation. You MUST buy oil with USD (otherwise you get freedom’d). With reduced demand of USD, this won’t be the case anymore (or less extreme). That’s what I’m trying to get at.
It used to be a little bit cleaner with actual good suggestions burried, now there's too many subscribers
i knew someone would say that haha.... this thread?
Wat..
I posted weeks ago (approx 8 days before SP announcement) about buying LEAPS when IV was in the 60s, WSB proceeded to call me retarded, I’m up 85K so far on my options.  Guess it’s retarded to know how options pricing works.

TFF has a few users that break news before anywhere else I've seen.  It seems as though at least one has a Bloomberg and posts news in the chat.  A while ago I created a chrome plugin to monitor the chat and beep when certain users would post.  That way I could work and still catch the news.  I stopped overall, though, because it annoyed me.
Whoever bought $23m worth of PLTR at $23.75 must know something or is ballsy as fuck.

Either way 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Where is the fucking volume
yes absolutely. calls were on discount. I bought several 5/21 300c for cheap.

CRM is a fucking machine. If people think they are overpaying for the slack acquisition, it's because they can overpay cause they are rich and have a solid customer base. I don't know of anyone that drops Salesforce for some other CRM/ERP/PCP/GHB etc.

full disclosure to Mr. SEC; I am responsible with evaluating and selecting our new ERP system at my work... and I pick salesforce. Even tho our account manager is a totally unprofessional frat boy

Black people who were still second class citizens died fighting for the USA in WW2.

Hirohito in his wildest dreams could not imagine a more pliant population - don't be fooled by the lively political theatre.

U.S. regulators are working on another proposal that could allow Chinese auditors to comply with the inspection requirement without violating their home country’s laws, which limit the sharing of information.

Yes, same, only 23, but I've been doing this for a few years and I study Finance so that helps a little with reading the statements and stuff. I unironically learned the most from browsing around here and looking at videos on youtube though. 

Best tip I can give you is, especially when you're holding shares, to not get spooked by the junkies on this sub. 90% of these people trade weeklies or monthlies and a -10-15% day will result in their account blowing up. Shares are timeless, even in the case of China stocks. If you're US-based you can even sell covered calls on your shares to hedge against drops.
Love that sound.

Oh you poor poor soul. It’s going to stay a penny stock brother.
That could actually kill you.
PLTR has nearly 3 million pre market volume.

That is fuckin ridiculous.
Bullshit
you should ask yourself, why would they do that on this pop and not the one last week? and then ask yourself, am i on the wrong side of this?

PLTR 42 EOW
Hopefully you have a 12/18 expiration date or later, or a broker you can call in. If you hold a position pre-merger, there's usually a 2-3 business day wait before they transition your position from the old ticker to the new one. You can add to your position today with LAZR, but you can't close out GMHI unless you call your broker to sell your contracts. If you have RH or WeBull, you're stuck for the next couple of days at least.

Do we still do short term SPY puts
Correction was already starting yesterday before GS released price upgrade. I wouldn't be surprised if it gets sold into today. Hell I wouldn't be surprised if GS upgraded to unload their shares if they are holding any.

Whenever the next stimulus goes through what stonks will make the biggest moves? Cruise lines ? Airlines?  Different area?
CRSR gonna go down to $28-$30. The correction will be complete after that.
I’m confused. Is he saying we shouldn’t be buying weekly OTM calls on PLTR? Can someone break this ideology down for me into terms an autistic 5 year old would understand.

I was hoping it would drop below 4 dollars. It hasnt. Its one of those things I kick myself for not grabbing onto when it was below 4. For a good long term hold. Until next december hold. Normal holiday seasons, they bank.

I am young, just turned 21 and still in college. I completely agree with you I think holding long term is hard to go wrong with companies with great potential and considering their gov contracts I have a good feeling about them so I think I’ll hold. The only reason I wanted to pull out like you said was to have more money for other trades cuz as I said I’m in college so my bank account a little ☠️💀
That’s all I want. Then I’m selling.
It already is. That’s the point

Disagree. Movie theaters aren’t going anywhere. Sure, the business model will change, but people still crave over priced popcorn, comfy seats, and 3d imax. I predict AMC will continue to drop for the next few months but like it long term. It’s a good brand and think someone big will swallow up their debt.

With another lockdown looming? Idts
The TPP was a containment of China, and very different from a trade agreement with it. It was to help get all the other surrounding countries on the same page.
I'd say it depends on your age, if you're young you can still take more risk because you'll have more time to work it off if it goes wrong. If you have responsibilities or a family to take care off I'd say take it easy with the risk. 

I think PLTR is a good long-term hold, but I'm extremely biased. They're ahead of their competition and seeing big players and institutions continue to load up on this (probably self-made) dip has given me a lot of confirmation (bias). Morgan Stanley set the PT at $17, but they own 3.4 million shares themselves lol. 

I think in the case of shares you can literally hold them forever, at most you'll lose gains you could have made somewhere else, but then it'll be the question if you would've played those other waves correctly. The stock market will always be a gamble short term, but if you invest long term in companies you believe in you'll be fine.

China has been doing that for years in the auto industry. Hence their national laws that force you to hand over all blueprints and design features if you manufacture there.

CRM up from here?

DKNG.....you piece of shit.

Good thing I figured you’d be a piece of shit, and bought puts.
China is the largest EV market in the world. Their government is really pushing for the adoption of EVs. Nio is one of the better players in China. Lots of growth ahead. I think Tesla will still dominate over there though.
Lol 1% up after a 15% down day. They’ll be a huge dump at morning
Now Im confused.
$35
725 or 843
That wasn't the takeaway
I would suggest y'all to get out of Chinese stocks.

SA is where they hid all the extra nazi science nerds so gotta make sure it stays weird so no one investigates
NIO hold?
How does Tesla keep going up and Microsoft, actually making money and going in gaming big, just trading sideways? This market really is a casino. Let's invest in companies and make hypothetical monopoly money, and forget about companies actually making money.

lol. that's the point. its a sarcastic statement based in fact. America brings you freedom when you have natural resources whether you want it or not.
CRM is going to ~$200-210. Don't buy calls yet.
Idk you can do mental gymnastics and say "well a spac isn't technically an ipo" but in that same article he said stripe is still in  the high growth phase of the business instead of the slow predictable one. Bill said they weren't ready to go public, which is what john said in different words. Psth is going to be bloomberg.

I work in manufacturing and I'm pretty familiar with our Chinese counterparts in my particular field. I can assure you any copies that China makes are more than likely inferior due to their manufacturing capabilities. I'm not saying it because of the "dur-dur-dur Chinese crap" argument. I've seen the lack of quality management and accountability in Chinese manufacturing. Combine that with production technology that is about 5-10 years behind and you have a sector that doesn't hold a candle to its American counterpart. You can commit all the corporate espionage you want, but at the end of the day if you can't manufacture it then all you have is an empty shell.
Absolutely no logic in this market, I’ve quit trying to rationalize
The more I lose, the more I spend trying to get it back. The more I spend trying to get it back, the dumber my plays become.  No hope

This would be true if there was anything long term about options...the calls these homies snorted makes being a bag seem like a promotion...and just like the cocaine, there was nothing but euphoric thoughts followed by a hard crash with an empty wallet.
 Next month or so
YES SIR - made like 22k over that month. Glorious
Its going to piss me off for selling 5k shares yesterday at 7.45 for a small gain.
Bingo.
[removed]
I think you missed the point.  If you're investing long term into a solid business then them blowing away earnings and the stock tanking is a dream scenario where you buy up as much as you can.

I'm buying JAN calls, (don't want to deal with theta decay)...not at open, wait for it to consolidate...like only chase commas said...9:45 to 10:30ish

Hedge with SC or Lp off and on through next couple weeks, take hedge off when not needed.  But, it seems to be a steady climb...I hate Fridays though...so maybe hold some back to add later, or take off half if good run today. then add more if it runs again
There's nothing grass fear mongering about it. Its a political reality and has nothing to do with whether the companies are legit or not.
Say msft had a -4% day and close at for example 210. What kind of strike price would you choose for a call then?

Short this to zero,  or load up on puts.
Yes earnings will likely leave a bit to be desired but that slight tingle in my left nut tells me there will be some really fantastic announcements in the report.
If you contact a Robinhood customer service agent the video from *The Ring* starts to play on all nearby screens and you'll get a call saying "seven days".
If the deal goes bust you'll get $20 per share back.
That's why you don't sell

CCL dilutes the shit out of their stock. Takes on a zillion dollars debt. Can’t sail and has basically zero way to make money with earnings report coming. Stock goes up every single day.

Stock dividend. It paid people half of the share in cash. They can all reinvest. Plus the drop makes it tasty for new investors. I copped yesterday a good amount of shares and im gonna buy more at open today. The english pump it every morning for us
It could show squidward when you're red, spongebob when you're green, and partick if you're doing dumb things.
You get an insane level of focus and mental clarity for 6-7 hours, feels like you can complete any task with ease, and you do it all and more. Then the high wears off and you spend the next 3 hours figuring out wtf you wrote.
please go brrrr Mr printer
Seems like it
anyways - just recall I called it in \~3months

If you can sell a CC, you can sell a CSP. You just have to have collateral to cover it in case you are assigned. Collateral is based off the strike price on the CSP sold multiplied by 100. So if you sell a 10p, you will need $1000 in collateral to buy the 100 shares at $10.
I agree, it always does that

Yeah I've been buying on the way down, but shares for now. Too early to say that it won't just go all the way to $5.

*New Jobless Claims decline for first time in 3 weeks despite COVID. *

You fucking dumb dumbs. As people are moved out of the work force, there are less people to lay off. And I sure as hell hope after 9 months of weekly claims averaging over 1M, we are trending down.
Create a shitty Shopify site selling chess sets. Run Google Ads campaign.
it's more a call on the CEO - he's a monster. super aggressive moves... and everything lately is starting to land their way. Based on my view today, wouldn't let my shares go sub 100.
This is what he does when the markets close
Hey man I just wanted to say that, as a new trader, it's really helpful when guys like you post this kind of info for everyone to see and use. I'm not sure what I'm doing yet, but I get a little bit closer from reading after quality posts like these!

I bought atm puts hoping for a pullback from the last big green dildo. No real news I could find justifying the pop, so I gambled.
You better be right or else. Or else what you ask
YYYYOOOOOLLLLOOOOOO
I don’t need it and take it for work/trading at work everyday. Just fucking in the zone and locked in, super alert but the come down is awful
I've already forgot more than you'll ever know, kid. Foh
Ahahahahahgaha
Sounds like you are up more than most people on this sub
This. We already priced in the next 5 recessions and insolvency crises, therefore they will not happen
Hold my nio $50 calls 12/4?
so .. this is exactly how PLTR started .. 1 dude daily PLTR .. and then it took off
Goldman's new calls go up
I think a 200 SPY target  is bold, not necessarily wrong but certainly bold.
Yeah true. I mean NIO will be unaffected by that bill so I expect to see it continue to go up and so far it’s doing good. PLTR on the other hand I’m debating whether I should just hold my shares for 10 years or sell as soon as I make a small gain and just get out of more speculative stocks and start just doing a 3-fund portfolio
im saying this will be a 1k stock easily by 2030.
PLTR reminded me of deal or no deal... being greedy always ended hilariously wrong

Crm shares and calls at open.
Anyone buying BA calls?
You realize you're gonna have to pay taxes on that $300 gain, right?
It’s 50 in a month. 

Buy shares. 

Sell puts on prices you wouldn’t mind picking it up at - collect premium. Buy more shares. Sell covered calls. You can hug this stock so you make money both ways. 

Or. You can own shares and buy puts to hedge those crazy days like yesterday. 

Stay away from FDs on this one. Leaps.

This market can never go down... (a lot of people thought that in August)
Ay man as someone who's had anxiety for most of my life that was actually enlightening. Never heard of that concept before but I think I could apply it to other areas of my life, thanks chief.
It’s almost as if they increased order volume delivery by 100% or something sell though it’s getting a big scary audit and it’s Chinese oOOoOOOoO
Thoughts on LAZR rn? Just out today, should I stand by and wait or go in now?

The price of the delisting vote was built in.   As more info came out, people realized there is no way in hell that NIO or companies like the BABA will not cave into the minimum requirements set by the US GOVT and lose most of their investors.   It simply won't happen.

Plus their sales report for November which was up over 100% YoY helped as well.

I went a bit too balls deep on it, it was my first "big" trade so as you can  imagine I'm learning a lot. $29 average babyyyyyy. 
Going to dump half of what I have at $30 so I have some float to play and not think about the other half til EOY 21.

Bought at 12, sold at 28, just rebought at 23

It’s called “trading” not “hold until worthless”
This is the lack of nuance and perspective I'd expect from a retard in one of the circlejerk libleft subs. Disputed elections in another country, like Turkey or US, does not paper wash the genocide of the Uyghurs.

Okay China man, I made the mistake of selling my shares in NIO and LI. LI was the worst investment that I ever made and my profit from NIO just covered it barely. 

What is your prediction? See a small drop in NIO and XPeng in the first 30 minutes and end in green?
get the one I bought 2 weeks ago. 12/31 $131 callllllls
Hopefully an idiot has my call and diamond hands CRSR... I wasn't expecting these shares to get called away this week!
it went full retard with downies and now it's going full retard with uppies

i bought an april 2021 call strike 11 just to avoid doing what you did.

I'm about to the point where I buy a put everytime it jumps 10 percent but I'm stuck in a covered call I need to roll out and scale back.
If PLTR goes up before 10:30 I’m goin!! if not I’m gonna have to hit McDonald’s for that 1$. Biscuit 😂

Well, you can never know, if it wasn't for that hit-piece I feel like the meme stocks could have gone for a few more days.
Yah how was this not the obvious play?
yes this thread does have a Heath Ledger feel to it. you know everythings going down haha
Oh boy. Can’t wait for ThinkOrSwim to freeze up at market open again and leave me holding my TSLA calls for 4-10 minutes... AGAIN🥵🥵🥵
this says otherwise: https://i.redd.it/4xvlaqwzdts11.jpg
No, I'm talking about using stops and a risk mitigation strategy. Most here just need a risk strategy to stay in the game.
Well shit, sold 565 puts on TSLA exp Friday. Thought I was gonna get some shares yesterday.  Oh well I'll take the cash.
Back at cha...remember market makers like to push the pain point. PRiNT Baby!
Kind of an intimidating chart to go short against.
Maybe FOMO after the delisting decision, seems late for that though.
Good luck to you!

People that think that have no experience. But once they get up and running it’s not too bad
OP is right here. Too early for me though
u/vredditshare
lol, when you buy shares and sell CCs, you ARE locking up your money. But in this case, you are locking up $1000 more per 100 shares. And selling CCs is bearish in nature. If PLTR goes on another huge run and you have a CSP, you can buy your put back for cheaper than you were paid for it. If it moons while you have a CC against your shares, you just have to sit and wait for assignment or spend more to buy your call back.
CRSR please don't dump in the morning and ruin my day again. My butthole is sore

There are various ways to not get caught. MS and the ilk are PR machines. They can downgrade the ratings and ask someone else behind close doors to buy the shares. There is no way they can get caught. There are so many ways to cheat the market.

High net worth individuals can ask MS to just downgrade rating of particular stock, then these individuals can themselves buy the same stock, not keeping any paper trail with MS. After everyone has bought, MS will say, may be in 2,6,8 months. Wow, everything has changed PLTR is 5\* stock now, thus increasing the value of ~~PLTR~~  high net worth individuals they work for.

TBH, I see NIO becoming a major worldwide player sometime in 2023-2024.    I can't even own a Tesla where I live, because the batteries aren't good enough for the cold, and for far distances.   Battery swapping is where it's at,  and as soon as NIO inks a deal with a major oil company to have a swap station at their stations,  this is going to moon so hard.

Or nah
no ive tried this 1000 times and got burned because it most often does not immediately dump (though it does sometimes). After pumps overnight that look like a "sure short"  it will:

1. pump after the open to burn shorts and puts stage 1, then 

2. it'll look like it's going down for like an hour and trade flat to downish beforrree

3. pumping stage two while burning the second round of put buyers who thought they were smart for buying puts at 2. instead of 1.

4. then slight melt-up before falling swiftly at EOD but maintaining a price above open or at least somewhere slightly below it

5. it will either gap down the next day or open higher than the day before's high

&#x200B;

cruel mistress that TSLA. I'd recommend an ATM put at open with at leassst 3 or 4 weeks to exp. Then wait for the additional pumps and buy slightly OTM puts expiring 2 weeks away and average into those.

Although China is now (at least nominally) a communist nation, their way of thinking is still fundamentally Confucian in nature. 

Confucianism is all about respecting tradition and not being disruptive, so copying existing ideas is more acceptable than inventing something new.

The worst thing about being on the GME bandwagon is that you need to buy shares like a boomer to make the most of it.

If it goes down your cost basis still goes down by $0.5 as you receive the full premium immediately when you sell the cc contract. If it goes down the cc offers no risk but you can close it by buying the contract back if you think its gonna rocket.

Most of the risk comes from the stock which you are bagholding

had a load of 2/21 FUBO 15c that I got when it was around 10 that was my big winner, also had some NIO 11/13 30c that banked. Been holding PLUG shares and calls long for awhile that helped too

Just so you know,  DraftKings and FanDuel have already paired with little Indian Casinos in Michigan, so the big casino players won't see any of this revenue.     

Michigan is the 19th state to legalize it,  which in theory would only amount to a small bump in revenue in the sportsbook.   Non Indian casinos in Michigan, except for Soaring Eagle and Firekeepers (not in Detroit) are nasty as hell.    The three in Detroit are not going to draw huge amounts of traffic from out of the City,  especially during the COVAIDS since Michigan's governor is an absolute nut job and has closed the casinos.  

Vegas is also in the shitter.     Not quite sure this is the time to buy Vegas tickers.

Oh. Oh no.
Your exit for NIO? With recent news and uncertainty I'm dialing down my plans and will exit around 60 mark, if at all.
You're taking too much.

Firstly, Vyvanse is what they give to potential ~~high risk patients~~ potential junkies.

If you live in a shit hole part of the country that is experiencing drug abuse problems, more than likely your doc will prescribe Vyvanse because you cant crush it up and snort it or inject it or put it up your asshole.

Adderall XR is what us upper middle class Canadians get.

I'm not talking out my ass here, if you have an understanding of how the drug affects you, you know that too much is worse than too little or none at all. You're wired all day and aren't eating which just fucks with your body & mind even more.

Ask your doctor to taper you down and tell them what side effects you are having. Also ask if you can try and different formulation (i.e. XR).

Please do not take the generic version. This isn't Tylenol, I have no fucking clue why the FDA would allow desoxyn or other pure formulations. Anyone who's ever tried it will tell you that is fucking wild compared to Adderall.

If Adderall is a cup of coffee, then desoxyn is straight caffeine powder.

Don't listen to the low life's on the internet that brag about how much they need take (both adderall & coffee). There's a fucking guy out here on reddit that may very well be dead by now, but they made a post about how they had prescription for ritalin and adderall and it was like 2 times my dose. What the fuck kind of junky life is that to live.

source: 20mg XR for the last 11 years. No side effects, no tolerance issues. I live a normal life. I also have a stonk gambling problem.

Most articles seem to agree. Even though it’s not the Hero’s Act, the fact that there’s new level of cooperation between repubs and dems could be just as positive for markets as the stim itself.

GS trying to put the squeeze on Burry
Well my first 25k I got from my job. I started trading options in March. I made money on my first trade on SPY puts (why is the first one always free?) and then thought it was so easy I promptly went on to lose almost 20k with other 'plays'.

I lost it on a combination of bad timing on certain plays and not understanding options fundamentals completely.
**[Learned helplessness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learned helplessness)**

Learned helplessness is behavior exhibited by a subject after enduring repeated aversive stimuli beyond their control. It was initially thought to be caused from the subject's acceptance of their powerlessness: discontinuing attempts to escape or avoid the aversive stimulus, even when such alternatives are unambiguously presented. Upon exhibiting such behavior, the subject was said to have acquired learned helplessness. Over the past few decades, neuroscience has provided insight into learned helplessness and shown that the original theory actually had it backwards: the brain's default state is to assume that control is not present, and the presence of "helpfulness" is what is actually learned.In humans, learned helplessness is related to the concept of self-efficacy; the individual's belief in their innate ability to achieve goals.

The lower the share price gets, the closer they become! It’s not ogre just yet. Question is why don’t they send the CIA on his ass
Well it might drop at morning...Don't expect them to expire worthless...take those shorts off before close on Fri at least cuz they can still exercise after hours. I had a short call on shares expire out of the money once, and the market makers (or my broker) waiting till mon and took my shares when Tesla popped. Dopn't be greedy, it you get a print, cash it in.

TLRY $8 covered calls hit last Friday, so I sold $8 puts monday. If it hits, I get the shares back. If not, juice that sweet sweet theta.
I admire your wishful thinking but nah your calls are fucked.
Lmfao deja vu
you could also sell an option at a higher strike than the one you purchased (in this example, say $215 call) to lock in profit. if the stock jumped from $100 -> $190 during the time you had a long-dated $200 call, selling a $215 call would almost definitely cover your original premium paid plus some. this way, if the stock ends at say $209 on expiration you would have collected additional premium on the $215 call (and it would not be exercised) and you cash in on the $200 call you originally purchased. if it expires above $215 you collect them premium and $1500 (difference in strikes times shares, $215-$200 * 100). to put it simply you'd be converting your call into a spread.

Thank you so much. That makes sense. In another scenario, if PLTR drops further to $20 and your CC went from $0.5 -> $0.1, can you close it out before it expires? Is it recommended to do that to reduce the risks? Or would it be better to just let it expire. 

Thanks again!

No the trend started in 5 Nov 2020, that was the day the first resistance at 11.20 was broken.  Fibonacci is usually drawn at the lowest point to top in uptrend and top to bottom in downtrends. In this case the lowest was on 6th October. We can see a healthy bounce at the 50% mark in a one hour chart.  The 50% mark bounce is accurate 95% of the time in my exp. If powerful people want this stock to tank to screw the WSB traders then I don't know what to say. They wanted payback on WSB traders for a long time now they got these people where they wanted them at their most vulnerable.

**[Anisette](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anisette)**

Anisette, or Anis, is an anise-flavored liqueur that is consumed in most Mediterranean countries, mainly in Spain, Italy, Portugal, Turkey, Greece, Albania, Lebanon, Cyprus, Israel, Palestine and France. It is colorless, and because it contains sugar, is sweeter than dry anise flavoured spirits (e.g. absinthe). The most traditional style of anisette is that produced by means of distilling aniseed, and is differentiated from those produced by simple maceration by the inclusion of the word distilled on the label.

Buy CRM before it’s too late
If you buy pltr at 30 and it drops to 22, you are down $8.

If you sell a covered call with a $30 strike for $0.5, you effectively reduce the purchase price of the stock by $0.5 no matter what happens to the stock. Worst case scenario the stock jumps to 35 and you miss out on $4.5 on gains as your max profit is at $30.5 before you get assigned. Best case scenario is stock stays same price so you can keep selling them once they expire.
PHUB
True but it has been a rough 3 days for me. no big deal holding on for 30 with more margin than my total account size.

It also depends on the future expectation of the two companies. theres clearly more hope or opportunity for docu to grow because CLDR is in a highly competetive market and has more or less reached its potential
Bless whoever hit back in the day
Here's a tip:

Take this man's post here and the previous one, copy them into a word doc, print that sucker out, turn off your phone, and read it 148 times until you get it.

NNDM next meme stock
I personally don’t have any shares just calls but I’ve been in since around 19. Sometimes shares are the play tho dawg
Imagine being a europoor and being like "yeah mate let me get some of them negative yield bonds, I don't think I can do better than -0.4% growth"
Hahaha how old are you guys actually actually. I grew up in Vegas and your putting weight in the physical casinos. I’m talking betting apps the likes of Robinhood. Just saying this will be a bump for options. Not saying buy the business.
The PM gap ups are gone 🤔 everyone's waiting for their next door neighbor to buy in the morning

Bought at 20$ last week, holding until 38$

Make it back with $ARKW, $NERD, $BOTZ, $LIT, & $ICLN
Yes that’s a great plan to go with from the beginning. Instead we went half and half and now the economy is fucked and people are still dying. Go tell the people in the refrigerator 18 wheelers to stop being pussies.
Because everyone's in TSLA/PLTR

Oh this is easy, we don't even have to actually start the ETF.
Go to the bank, withdraw your deposit for the WSBfund in cash. Go to your backyard and light the money on fire while screaming PLTR to the moon.
Results will be about the same.
Always new blood. 10,000 new retail traders a day, most young white guys. Why do you think weed is back on the menu? The companies aren’t the reason. ACB might be entirely run by manic stoners. 

Either way, the sausage machine needs meat and it keeps getting more.
What news channel do you guys put on in the background?
You’re about 3 years late
This sub has changed too much. Trinity lead me to the forked WSB sub
The only reason weed is getting legalized is because the “legal” distribution businesses are sitting on mountains of cash that the fed wants

When he said it tense
Bought at $30. 80% of my portfolio is PLTR shares and I have a $36c 1/15/21. I still have hope 🚀
My tits have tits with GME written on them.
Anyone have an opinion whether there is any short-term profit left in weed stocks?
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Hoping you held unlike me brother. Godspeed today!
Premarket has tsla at 594 so you tell me.
So I bought in really early to Nio.  Sold at 35 for reasons I can’t quite remember.  Then bought back in. Then sold. Then bought back in. Most recent, I sold out in the 53 ish price when noting the day to day trend downward.  Then bought back in yesterday at 38.9.  

Did the same with PDD.  Noted a day to day downward trend.  Decided to sell out a portion of it.  Then sold off more as the downward trend continued.  Bought back in... etc etc.  

There’s no guarantee of a best time to buy or sell. Hindsight is 20/20. Could I have held NIO this whole time? Sure.  

If you’re looking for truly passive income, you’ll want to look at VERY stable stocks, ETFs, and/or funds.  

Because I got tired of trading in 6 different accounts, I’ve transitioned my Roth  and my HSA to mainly just ETFs and Funds.  This way it will passively grow and dividends being reinvested.  At the same time, I reduce the number of accounts I have to watch on a day to day basis.

I’m by no means an expert or a professional. I’ve just gotten lucky during this whole COVID thing especially with VIXY.

Like you believe anything China says. It always says On thing and does another. There is always a plot twist. It’s like NIO said the other day that they are already compliant and don’t need to worry. Well yeah NIO inc might be, that doesn’t mean NIO China isn’t. Imagine an American company auditing NIO China? “So where do the money for this new headquarters come from? Where did the money for the new products come from? Where are the sales records? Where are the production manifests? No chance is China going to consent to it.

I can't wait to see all the "Why'd I Sell?!" Posts on PLTR next year.

For some reason everytime Rocky comes up I always think of Bill Burr's Philly rant

There's a never ending line. Commissiom free fractional share trading over simplified apps is new. Our kids will be doing it too
Also, I don't trust Dec 18 not to be a drop as is triple witching day. who knows
Hello. Thank you. If i like a stock say AQN but feels it's overpriced don't want to buy but would if it fell 15%. Would I sell a put? A strike price 15% lower? Thus giving me a premium and if strike price the shares of the company at the price I find of fair value? Thanks.
Idk what this means but you sound intelligent so this bull is scared
Profit taking at open is going to drop it back under $22 before it would climb anymore. Prepare the diamond hands.
When people learn how unemployment numbers work it shocks them.  It's such a bullshit number.

Trust me, we will always have millions of new retards.
you should buy them back at the open while they're cheaper than you sold em for and then use the gains to buy 12/18 22p and then roll the gains from that into a block of shares

Yes

Got in yesterday
You need to read the footnotes. This is the difference between a retard and autist. This was a conversion to the class of stock that is publicly traded. He’s going to dump at least some of it after lock up expires after ER. You sir are a retard destined to lose a lot of money.
It was part of the meme stock bubble burst
just JPM at work
Get in on PSTH until it’s too late boys
Palantir has been around since 2001.  I remember seeing something about them 10/15 years ago on a late night news network. The wealthiest company’s you’ve never heard of or something.  The show explained who they were and I always remembered them. When I saw it on WSB I went to my RH account and bought a few. But I’m getting the itch to do some options.
Where’s the daily DD reassuring me of the GME squeeze?
Maybe a dip at open, but overall I think it'll trend upwards.  Maybe finish the day around 208-209.
This is just an opinion, not advice, but here we go:

Don’t.
QE has been mostly bond and MBS purchases. The Fed doesn’t buy stock. The money the banks are getting from the purchase is what they’re putting everywhere including stocks thus leading to inflated asset prices. There’s so much money that they have to put it in every financial product there is. They’ve probably made new products since march too. So indirectly QE does lead to consumer inflation. It just takes a while to work it’s way through the economy and then reflect in the feds indicators.
I wish it were different, but we have to accept reality.
Watch it. If it breaks $600 easy you can hold. It’s tried 3 times now. Third times a charm.
i bet the guy selling naked calls to you is the one sitting in front of you.
you’re gonna regret that
As high as Snoop Dogg
You ever fought someone who’s retarted? The strength and determination is nothing to be fucked with
On top of that there's this thing called a variance ratio test that is used to test whether prices follow random walk (i.e. Weak form market efficiency is true and TA is useless in generating consistent returns). I've tested many securities that failed the variance test, but seen people carrying out TA on those exact securities 🙃
buy the dip
Not just Italians bro, lotta portugese, Irish, polish, etc. maybe the old nyc accent was Italian but now, other types of people live in those neighborhoods and now they sound like that too.
Small position of 500 warrants at 1.79.

Sex before bed lol
Why tho

The fact that the dollar is down a whole HALF A PERCENT and the market is flat should scare the fuck outta you bulls.  That's insane.  Futures should be ripping to Valhalla at this point.
🚀PLTR to sea level!!🚀
aunt Jemima is thicc
Continuing claims down because people been on unemployment for so long they are starting to get kicked off. Initials are down because it's only first time unemployed.

Such a fucking shit show fuck the fed
I plan to hold. Today and tomorrow should be fun.
Have to appease the algos ;)
Whose buying BA at open for a hold
sell
To the moon
Did splunk decide to visit a cave?
it goes to $40 eoy from here
I'm gonna personally downgrade NKLA's 'strong sell' to 'GET THE FUCK OUTTA HERE' with a price target of 'delisted'.
What will it be by Christmas
fuck nikola and fuck trevor milton
Then just wait. Next week it’ll go to 20s
Come on, that not the way
CRM nice PM gains
whats the strike
Should I make my gains post when I hit the five figure club, or when I 10x my account, or when I hit the day trade club?
They gonna lose against C9
Sold a tsla $500c 12/24 a few days ago, and I have a $562.5/$567.5 12/4.  We eatin.

On that note.... should i buy back the short leg of the spread and continue the moon mission, or play it conservative?

Edit: buy back, not sell the short leg
Yes 👍

They can't seal this bad boy up fast enough for me...tying up most of my cash. I figured this has a great upside (up to $25-$30 a share) and minimal downside as shares will always be worth $10 as per SPAC agreement.

I sold a bunch of PLTR puts at the $21 strike set to expire tomorrow. Think I’m getting assigned or nah?

Kinda want those shares ngl.
And my....phone!
PLTR is back time to rebuy those 35c 12/4s u paper handed...
PSTH is the $20 one but I'm not sure about favorable protections. The warrant structure does offer strong incentives to hold for the long term rather than sell on news, if that is what you mean.
added my 1K shares @ $17.50
CRSR be like ‘it do go down’
Jobless claims came in at 712 vs 780 expected
Not if they trade like some here
Depends on if you think Tesla is a car company or a tech company.
Earnings
I was born and raised retard! The NY accent doesn’t even exist in NY anymore! Only old timer italians still talk like that. Looks like YOU gotta stop watching movies and actually come to NY. Like my boy 69 once said “STUUUPIIIDD”
It’s so hard to stop, I have no energy
Throwing 25% of my portfolio on APPL 04DEC calls.🚀🌕
I hope you're right. I'd love to buy a huge dip.
If it drops this morn take off your short calls if in the money, roll them into short puts to make up the loss, take short puts off once loss is made up if ya can't back up taking shares. Short sellers gonna be pissed Goldman just did an upgrade so maybe the moon. but prolly volatility. Nothing new.
That's true, but what I am saying is that there is no way to completely neutralize delta with those explosive moves.
thats a lie and you know it
Tradings gonna get a lot harder once we don’t have a million new retards buying any and everything isn’t it?
What was that guy’s trade?
He is, there are two points on a trend. One point it can’t go lower than and a point it can’t go higher than.
Btw is this your defense for being a salty bitch to me earlier because I was right AGAIN and you were wrong? Hmmm show some class man
10% uppies in PLtR. Probably happen by noon
I mean logically that’s what it should do but we know how logical this market is. PLTR $50 Eod
Don't know how tf you can sleep at night
Nah we've consolidated and built a huge new support at 22.50-23 range. That's our new bottom. I expect a good pop today up but nothing crazy. Hopefully close around 25 today and then 26 tomorrow
We’re all pros until we’re not
Sell my 12/4 PLTR calls at open or hold?
If you’re not filtering by top all-time when you find a new subreddit then idk what to tell you
SPY didn’t you hear everyone has jobs again? You can wake up anytime bud.

Holy balls! How did crsr go from 51 to 35?
It’s on like donkey Kong. Next 2 weeks we big boys.

They wanted pay back 😈
Yes
got 100 at 25.53 plan on getting another 100 if it drops a bit more today. I dont trust that 5% premarket will hold so might wait till mid day to average in.
Nice
Oh man. Is today the day PLTR finally recovers at full blast?
If PLTR can NOT dump at open...I promise i won't be a greedy little fuck boi
Bullish af so we'll inexplicably dump 3% today for no reason.
we holding or selling our TSLA calls @ open? ima listen to u autists
Yeah. Jobs numbers and unemployment are total garbage imo. Underemployment and people who stopped looking should be counted. Make it FT v not FT
Let the news flow on! As long as the market doesn’t shit itself. We in the money. Calls then theta gang if you want to play tsla.
10am I have been told
what news i got a call hope it prints
IV means nothing if you are a share holder
This is the way
How can it not?! being in both new gen consoles ps5 and the Xbox  + the market share its taking from Intel
Lost it at "can't go tits up", the PLTR gang memes were good, but this shit is priceless
Seen this one before 😢
Good for you, I’m up 10 times that and I’m holding till it’s 10 times more because I only pick winners
It will come down with spy whenever that is
saw, profit up. Man I like Kroger but that stock goes nowhere
So uh, don’t be mad, but I might have hedged, bought stock and recouped my losses on the gains.
I don't really have any DD. I just think it's a cool system that I'm too poor to afford. The Green line go up a few days ago, I may be able to buy one soon? Thanks! Rocket Rocket Rocket
'Most day traders lose moeny'....lmao, ok. So do most people that work for 40 years. Atleast with day trading you have a chance of retiring.
Well established and still not cracking 1b revenue and losing money. I guess in this environment that’s what we want.
Let me tell you you will make much more with a 3-fund portfolio than most of us will actively investing so good choice

I haven’t been here in a while since I last got wiped out. A friend suggested I buy pltr, mainly bc of the board and the function of the company. so I got in at $14 when I couldn’t stand to hear him talk about his gains after he got in at $9. I sold half my shares at $19 thinking, “holy cow! That was quick and easy.”

It’s paying off in my sales qouta for sure
This really is retarded.  You can't sell your shares without getting out of the covered call.  That would then be a naked call which unless you have a lot of $$$ most WSB idiots like me don't have the capability.

You can buy it back for a loss or just roll it out further for more credit.

Or just let the shares get called away and wait for a pullback to rebuy in.
It was downgrade by someone
Smart move.... do they have a big segment of their business dedicated to logistics?

Is it realistic for Tesla to crash big time at some point or is a relatively safe stock at this point?

Godspeed retard I’m rooting for you but I’m not liking those first few option dates lol assuming you have some more leapish dates off screen
Why buy? I never sold the ones I had!
I put 50k on TSM yesterday

Ok well we should probably address the bad flu don’t ya think?
You can buy back at a deficit. I don't recommend it though. What is the average price of your shares and what is the strike of your covered call?
Huh?  Is your call ITM?  Just let it get assigned away
Yeah that’s probably healthy bro keep it up!
Nope. 3 days of profit-taking on ended on Monday (my assumption), which is why I bought. Tuesday we went up as I had assumed (profit taking done, etc). Yesterday’s dump was completely unexpected. No idea what’s going on... Way oversold even looking at RSI/W%R.
MIK killed earnings and up 5%. 40% is short and need to cover
I did as well, the name sounds cool
Way to long. I need my money now🤓
My calls were up 6% EOD yesterday, and I’m selling at open. IV can suck my microdick
Guess this is the sign boys, buy!!
Bought a few 600 FDs for Friday gonna roll them out
Well that's why I'm watching AAL, somebody has to fly those things and if they don't, they will go up once travel opens again

For some reason I though PLTR was up Tuesday pre-market, and folks were saying it was gonna make up for Monday. Instead it nosedived.

I didn't follow it yesterday.
You missed by far the most important part where the vice chairman of the Chinese SEC equivalent signalled confidence in being able to reach a compromise and a strong willingness to have Chinese companies retain access to US capital markets. This happened within the last month, in specific reference to this bill.

This feels like the calm before the storm, the dip every fomoing retard out there has been waiting for, the shaking off of all semi retard paper hands from the stock. Now we rally to to 40$ PLTR  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀

The do genome readings. The idea is that a lot of illnesses can be detected early with genome readings. In the future you can minority report illnesses before they happen by finding defective DNA. This company has achieved great things by scaling readings to a point where they are affordable to most consumers. If you can predict illnesses before they happen and your tests are cheap, you have a monster business model.

they stopped scaling down the cost of test and instead went for profits. I think the smart move is make tests even cheaper and unlocked a much larger market. to read a genome your basically run it through a scanner over and over to build a picture of the genome. There is a long version and a short version. to corner the market you want to have the capacity to do both and Illumina is really weak on short reads (or was it long?). they even tried to buy companies that could and got denied.

Honestly Crispr stocks probably have massive potential but they are complex as hell and a dime a dozen. It makes it hard for me because I barely graduated high school (so theres probably a lot wrong in this post). So cant recommend this company personally. probably easier to buy ARKK and let them do the DD.

Ok guys seriously last chance for TSLA sub $600. Sub $600 will be like seeing sub $400. Only possible when the market shits itself. We be trading in the 600-700 band for the next 4 months until we pop off again.

That says Nio is claiming to be in compliance, not that it is in compliance. Compliance would be determined by the SEC/PCOAB.

" Investors might be surprised, given the stock decline, to hear NIO believes it is compliant. That appears to be the situation. NIO’s spokeswoman responded to an emailed statement from *Barron’s* saying NIO was aware of the situation and became compliant over the past few months. "

&#x200B;

As said before, CCP law blocks the PCOAB from confirming the audit. Which is required by law.

&#x200B;

From the PCOAB site :

" The PCAOB spent significant time and resources negotiating a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the Chinese authorities for enforcement cooperation. Unfortunately, since signing the MOU in 2013, **Chinese cooperation has not been sufficient for the PCAOB to obtain timely access to relevant documents and testimony necessary to carry out our mission** consistent with the core principles identified above, nor have consultations undertaken through the MOU resulted in improvements.

Shhh it's up just fine. The last thing we want is a huge jump up quickly again. Let it slowly grind back up to 25 today then 26 end of week and build some support
Nope, on that timeline algos and MM will fleece you. Algos have a hard time short term and long term, medium term they shine and cant be beat.
Hey remember when we told you to buy the once in a life opportunity of a crash level NIO and Xpeng dip, whelp...should bought the dip yet again. Market open is your last chance for huge discount get in or get left behind

That sums up PLTR, we were duped
They're either high on copium or trying to pump and dump because they bought at the top last week

Chill bro. We get it you love daddy T. A little overblown yes, fraudvirus? Take a trip to El Paso they got refrigerated 18 wheelers stacked full of dead body’s.

It’s a health pandemic and needs to be addressed.

Except yesterday, still crashed tho. So yeah, not a sign of anything
Stuck bag holding PLTR too huh?
😂😂😂 PLTR wiped so many people out and people are  so quick to hop back on the wagon
GUH
I think they are just voting on an extension to the amount of time they have to finalize the deal. Still a good sign though since if so that means the deal is in progress and they expect it to go through with a bit more time. I'm up to 600 shares after buying this week's dip, hoping it hits $18-20 when the deal finalizes.

Supply is somewhat limited with the PS5, demand is insanely high. In services and extras PS5 wins, they get too many first releases first and exclusives. Xbox has good games too, PS5 doesn’t have actual racing (fuck gran turismo) but Xbox is a laggard in exclusives and services.
Yay!

pleas answer
PLTR always does good pre-market. Not a sign of anything tbh
Pltr a buy at 23.5 or do not touch?
The NY accent is just italian immigrants speaking English. I don’t even know anyone who talks like that except italians 🙄
bro not you too, i thought you knew better
May the tendie gods smile on you
If PLTR shoots to $30 again what levels of IV are we going to be seeing lmfao?
[removed]
I stopped reading when you said 700 EOD.
Up $5.97 right now baby boy 🥶👅😈😈😈
This is actually really good advice.  
I FOMOed hard on PLTR.
PLTR up 6% pre market
Also, I’d suggest something somewhat longer.. but calls for April-July 2021.  It gives you time to watch how the price reacts to market fluctuations while keeping you protected from any crazy, sharp swings.
There's premarket options on spx you noob
Ban
PLTR
Not slating you or anything, just curious... What is your reasoning behind it not being above $50? I may be completely off my rockers, but a company that has multiple contracts with different governments and expanding into commercial I can't see how this shouldn't be around $150 in the next couple years?
Might just be there for premarket
Famous danish investor (Lars Tvede) says every ~10 years there is a major economic/stock crash, and he’s been right the past 40 years, and he believes this current crash was one, so he thinks the next period starts now; Bull the next ~10 years
Thanks, you're sweet.
I will!

I think a key difference would be that you aren’t under threat of punishment or reprimand for talking openly about them.
Must have finally found that pot of gold.
Are we cashing today bro?
Think its the demand, also the PS5 and Playstation overall has a much higher demand and is more popular around the world.
I threw 70% of money into to YOLO
It’s the same way how you will submit your tax forms annually and the IRS will tell you if you’re stupid or not. Although it could still be faked, an auditor would comb through a lot of documents already and often if there’s a discrepancy they already know it. They’re just looking for you to explain it. Being publicly traded, the IRS will already know the quarterly numbers. They’ll just need proof that any major sale/purchase can be backtracked.

I’m pretty sure China can have a % stake, they just want to make sure that the gov’t aren’t the ones running things. Either way, even if China does end up controlling NIO it can only help us investors unless they get caught.
Soon you will see hell erupt in wsb lol
I feel like being cash for an extended period of time is even worse.
I can’t believe I didn’t buy some TSLA when it was below 400...
GME incoming moon landing 🚀🚀🚀
PS5 has better exclusives and I think the better controller. Xbox is a better value with game pass and better hardware. If you like the PlayStation exclusives, pick ps5. If you just play the games that are cross platform and like the better UI and enjoy gamepass games, Xbox is hard to beat
I made a lot. But gave a huge chunk back buying more. Fools game
Sounds soul crushing
Guess that house vote didn’t kill nio......let’s goooo

Yolo baby
Ah gotcha, thanks
I use $500 every week for weeklies. One of these weeks, I’ll make it. So no, I won’t stop, can’t stop.
The ticker is usually available day of IPO even before open. You put in a limit order in advance and it’ll execute at the best price.
now is the time to buy boomer stocks. this little vaccine will give them just enough life to take flight. all in AAL, UA and DAL
nobody is talking about the XBox, i think the PS5 won
Neither company can keep units in stock.

Simple 

I got in at 17$ 

Not at 30 

U buy because u think the stock will go up 

Due to hype

Nobody on fundamentals

Nobody gives a fuck about numbers of revenue know that shit it’s all about fucking hype OK that’s how you TRADE in 2020 hype hype hype!!!!!!

Now get that mouth ready for this pltr cock

Allright, which of you retards held Tesla puts overnight?
The problem with F or GM is every time they start turning things around and doing well here come the Union negotiators
Isn't that basically what the marker has done all week?

The day is flat but before and after are where the action has been at.
Today has nothing to do with spike imo, target merger is around dec 7th - abril
Thanks for talking sense into me
Ripping this morning!
Since when is gay offensive
I’d say playing with fire
That was me, wasn’t retarded on Monday

Sir this is a long John silvers!
3%!?! What happened? Be’gorrah!
COVID was never a thing, see for example it circulating Oct-Mar in the west with no one noticing until the media created a panic, and Japan not testing, ignoring COVID and having no problems. 50+% of Tokyo was poz and recovered and now has antibodies. It's a fraudvirus and now there are multiple vax, sorry pal we are opening up.
I downvoted cause ur gay
Early dip as usual and then yes
No no pay attention to news as that effects PM heavily and just following regular supports and resistances should work greatly
PS5 has actual trends and hype. Xbox is a millennial console that millennials can no longer afford
...
I forget if it was both sony and msft but sony said they'd have more shipments coming before end of year.
I have never made a dollar buying puts
I’d like to do that, but I believe we will
eventually have a secular equity crash and not recover to current prices for a decade or more.  Because that’s what happened the last 2 times we approached these valuations. I know the central bank conditions are different, but my best guess is that that’s just delaying the inevitable.  And the gamma even on LEAPS feels too high to take the risk, compared to just owning shares.

I think maybe it could make sense for me in some sectors, though. Particularly energy and precious metals.
[deleted]
I’m on
Should I just throw 300 on LAZR shares?
PLTR.....dead 🐈 bounce incoming. Yet another chance to see retards throw good money after bad.
Me too man, me too. Sorry y’all.
GME to Squeeze, loaded it up.

PFE to go up a bit, buying after the initial morning pop.

BB to open up then slowly go down, selling ASAP.

ACB to grow through the day, I have a few thousand in shares so hopefully sell green this afternoon or tomorrow opening.
Well I did step 1.

Great call at 180% IV

When I see shit like this I'm glad I decided to be a pussy and run the wheel
It’s on the schedule for end of year. Not sure if people realize (they probably do) but Boeing was paying out millions of dollars to companies when they were grounded. This takes a significant amount of cash flow issue away.
Holy shit, thanks for explaining why I felt that way. I didn't recognize it, manga fan. Watched the anime and OVA's only once. Wasn't sure where the feelings were coming from.

Let me know how it goes. Love hearing if people make money while using my TA. It makes all the late nights worth it.
Super easy, barely an inconvenience.
How so? Just getting into swings early?
Very daper.
Of course when I switch to puts on PLTR..........fuck
NIO to the MOON🚀🚀🚀
I felt that
I hate how awful I am at times
Pltr kept tanking and sold covered calls yesterday instead of today when I would have got much more value. Guh
$30 by dec 11th you heard it here first
Same here, bought in at $9.80, sold at $18, then bought back in at $22. going to fucking moon on this one boys
Their stuff is held together with toothpicks and duct tape though.
New 10 year bull run starts today?
I bought calls at 37. Did not look like a bull trap to me...
How is DOCU 40b market cap and CLDR 4b? Is DOCU not super overvalued or does it seem right?
Already in with 12/31 125c
I’m not a bollinger band, you are! 

Thank you for reassurance.
🚀🚂🚆PLTR🚀🚂🚆
What price are you targeting to sell?
No
Can you younger folks explain the current console war for me? Like, who's the perceived winner/leader?  PS5 or XBox?

IS the supply low or is it just purely high demand that is causing these shortages?
2001
X2, you’ll hate options starting with Tesla
Next time just send a text to yourself. You're guaranteed a reply. Somebody cares
Thank you will have an eye on the development. Only considering buying shares
Today starts the squeeze
Please be right i cant take these sleepless nights anymore
Thats the wsb way. You belong here
NIO 55 eod.
Lmao this is how you know we’re in a bubble
No
To major banksters have downgraded them.  Always inverse that shit.  They dont put out research to help people like us.  They want to keep it cheap for a while so they can position.
SPCE now and next week. FAA accreditation space flight due from 10th Dec. Looking good
yes
And then sell @ bottom when it crashes
Anybody holding DOCU through earnings or sell and buy back tomorrow after earnings?
125 would be choice 💪💪👌
Apparently AAL is using them domestically now
Grounded possums nipples
Bought at 39.50. you bailing or holding?
They have the wrong people in the movie business. Sign this man up
Not gonna happen. Pipe dreams.
I’m a perms bull, but I feel like we’re going to drop on open and drill through the morning. May recover to green by EOD

So Palantir not going back to $15 huh
Why do you need to decide now? You need to be reactive and not proactive. Literally follow the two options when the time comes. You won’t miss out on anything. It’s not a race friend. Slow down homie. And please read up on basic support and resistance and uptrend and downtrends. Then you’ll start to get my posts. I can’t help you anymore. Like I I said. I’ll pray that you gain some understanding but for the love of GOD do a little work. I love you friend. Just put some effort into it.

I sold my $25P for gains when it wasn't breaking past $17 for hours and bought some $18P yesterday after the bounce. That it is still green is stupid.

Prediction: Pops up above 24, reverses back down to 23.40 where bears declare victory, then it slowly climbs the rest of the day. Gap up tomorrow to end the week at $25

Ahh I see. Whenever I *don't* have CRWD calls for their earnings, they fucking moon...
It was. Absolutely epic in a more real way. I love the Wolf of Wall Street but DBC ain’t a joke.
It will moon, don't worry. The biggest gains killer is checking your portfolio every day. Just let it rest and you will be rewarded. Buy leaps if you're playing with options at all
SQ or TSLA weeklies at open?

I wouldn’t start with TSLA, it’s pricey.  Learn with something cheaper.  Ford?  CCL?
$125.50-126. Would love to say $128+ but it just doesn’t move that much that quickly.

Been a bit tired of all the PLTR talk since i cant get in on it other than stocks. I hope this shit consolidates at 15-20 for 2years so i dont have to see more shit about it.
You are on WSB, so, however long that's been a thing

Oh I play options too. I bought them as a safe spot to drop some of my portfolio but then aapl stayed flat all this time. Now I can exit the position and yolo it some where to chase my losses from my other plays 😎
TESLA. The big short guy pleads with Elon to sell 25 to 50% of Tesla stock to help his shorts. F him.

Goldman comes out this morn and rates a buy, from 445 to 780...hoping for a slight retraction this morn, then let the short squeeze begin.

So wondering if Goldman is doing a 'back at cha" to Barry. Ha!

So I ask you, who is contributing more to the world, Elon? or short shitter Barry.
Every time you guys jinx it, just hit 20 already so we can bounce bak
$125.5
Anyone else down bigly from CRSR? Bought 6k worth at $40
Looks like his shorts got fucked haha
Imagine you did it last month though
Create a stop loss order bro, basic fib retracement will bring PLTR to 12.00 - 14.00$ a share. You bought the top, bubble burst, going to retrace 88% from ATH....

Total return -$158,250 (-57.25%)

Go look at NKLA all time chart, it will look just like that...  Robinhood fractals
[deleted]
Or the smart money knows the part is over, but still have shares left and want these meme stocks to run a bit more so that can continue selling to wsb are the top and selling you options that willl explore worthless. And if you think I’m wrong, ask yourself, why are they called the smart money and why are they in the Bahamas right now...
Same..had a 600 call for 12/18 that I sold for a measly $1100 profit.
tsla calls or nio calls today? Which one are you guys fomoing into?
There would have to be significantly more IVx for you to see IV crush.
PLTR calls
Upvote= Today is a Bullish day
Downvote= Gay bears 

Choose wisely
How low will SNOW go today. Sell puts at open to cover other put losses or hold for the first half hour. I’m afraid of a big bounce.
Iceman to PLTR: You’re everyone’s problem. That’s because every time your price increases, you’re unsafe. I don’t like you because you’re dangerous.

AAPL goes up 30 cents and y’all think it’s going to go up 5 bucks by EOD.
Mate that would be mental
I hope it's gonna break history by being the first company to have a negative sign in front of their stock price
I am going to mortgage the house to buy AAPL LEAPS
Wow that was it.  The last Palintir dip ever.
🚀 P L T R 🚀
That's great man!  I've gotten a little burned a few times selling covered calls (on more meme type stocks when they have huge movement one way), but if you stay on top of it you can really grind out some nice  money.  
Just make sure to save money to pay taxes.

Even if the stock goes up over your strike, you are still making money.  That's the beauty.  And Costco is a blue chip stock to own.
Check out projectoption. He has a playlist with a complete guide iirc

Doesn’t that retard Michael Burry realize that stocks only go up???? Tesla is not a MBS
Getting overly greedy on either side will just lead to tears.

Still going to get IV crushed lmfao.

Those options are priced for like a 8% daily move
As if we bears weren't already quiet. So quiet we can only hear you swear every 2 words and insult people who obviously are not the reason for your repeated loss of money on the stock market
Your friend has a punchable face. Punch him in the face for me.

First time buying calls... what should i do with tesla!?
I think it dips first 30 minutes. Buy then. Don’t buy any crazy FD with short expiry tho
Yesterday made up for Monday and Tuesday losses. I'm hoping for profit today, but of course, I hope for profit everyday.

Palantir bears any comments on it mooning premarket, dump at open then mooning the rest of the day?
That's why I sell 9c dec18 against my shares

AAPL eod predictions?
There's a reason I'm keeping an incredibly close eye on the strength of the dollar as well as treasury yields.

Momentum is weak, insider selling is high, and most experienced fund managers realize what's happening right now.
just got off of a ban for saying a mean word. I had to sit through multiple days of my PLTR collapse without being able to bitch about it on here.
Still holding from $400. Been a fucking RIDE.
Haha. I lotto’ed 367c at close. I need to look at aapl. I might add it to tomorrow’s post. Thanks friend.

I hope so. Been a rough week
Don’t lie to him like that
If a stock dumps by 32% you dont hope for another -3% you greedy fucks. Have fun watching from the sidelines and buying at the top in a week because you hoped for sub 20.
Making money or losing money overall? Where are we at WSB?
610. Check out the volume on those 600,610c + price upgrade. Im not holding anything though.
SWBI up pre market. Earnings after the bell today. Should definitely crush them and jump to $20 or near it.

That's hilarious

100 years is a long time. Also Enron went bust in 2001, Worldcom in 2002. Too even bigger scandals. In the next 80 we will probably see even craszier scandals.
Around 20 is good, gonna go sideaways now imo
Thanks and happy cake day. This should be moved to the top
LOL, somebody mad..
The pressure is monster pandemic, and Canada and Mexico legalized it. Makes the USA look fucking retarded not legalizing it. The laughing stock even UN just said it’s officially safe, I believe full heartedly it passes the house but the senate will be tough but guess what we all know those old fucks wanna make a quick buck, look at prohibition of alcohol for comparison oh and alcohol 30x dangerous as weed
If you’re gonna buy Tesla options, prepare for some fuckery. It’s gonna kangaroo
Why the fuck is NKLA green ?! They don't deserve to be green, they don't even deserve to be there! ERHHHHH MAAAA GAWDDDDDD

You could have said that same thing about a 2000s era Apple. 

But you had Steve Jobs, industry changing tech, and vision that was outside of the norm which piqued interest. 

That is Tesla in a nutshell and that’s why it’s at where it’s at.
Careful 😳 by 2021 they might know how to build the exterior. 2027 they might understand hydrogen tech! NKLA 1000$ soon😈💀
HEY PLTR IS GOING UP !!

You want to look up ['covered calls'](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/coveredcall.asp).

this gives me a warm, fuzzy feeling. wholesome as fuck!
I’d love to see it but $80 (14%) days aren’t typical, even on a good one.
Yep future looking into the year 2030 based on current valuations.
DD is a bra size and means large breasts. People use it here to ask if someone has jerked off to large boobies that day. ie. ask your friend if they've done their DD yet today before trading.
Be sure to wait for ATH

Ah bro that’s how TSLA was from the time i started dating her in 2016 up until last year. Thank god she got that jim cramer lipo and now looks sexy as fuck!
Damn...  high stakes
Just give up on puts.

Ideal cup size
I bought yestersay at 21.70
-5 years old
It’s due diligence of deep dive basically saying do ur research on the stock before buying
People on this sub are retarded but at least accept and understand that shit happens and they are responsible for their own retarded choices gain or loss.
Factor in a falling dollar and very few other “safe” places to put your money. Does that apply to 1999-2000 as well?
The GME squeeze will go down in history as the true [Tragedy of the Commons](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tragedy_of_the_commons).
Apple Tesla & AMD I salute you all ✊🏼
Good sex should be obvious. Both your question and her response are awful.
Same. Paper handed cause of Burrys tweet...I didn't feel comfortable holding too long
CRM makes sense imo in regards to the Slack drop They overpaid for a platform that doesn't do anything special and have not released plans on how they plan to use it or integrate it. Microsoft Teams has a pretty good foothold since it comes with Office. I don't think CRM will go much lower, but the initial concern and stock hit is justified imo. I opened a position yesterday tho with 50 shares
Yes, this this this. Palantir is going to ruin a lot of bears...the same ones who keep burning out on Tesla 😂

OH YEAH PLTR IM GONNA CUM BABY KEEP GOING

Lots of NIO talk, what about LI?
This
I’d sell if it gets above that cuz I think it’s below 600 eow
Gaming hardware or mortgages?
would love another BB spike towards 10 today so I can buy cheap 7.50 strike puts. Should have pulled the trigger on this 2 days ago
Hoping for 610 but we could see a small rally and big pullback to kill options
What do you guys think is $20 a good point to buy PLTR? Havent invested before in PLTR
First ones free, just buy calls on anything.
I think a lot of people stopped in September after that crash cause better things to play have popped up. Back in July/August that’s all I bought really. Buy a call or two next couple days already be up 100% lmao good times
650
I don’t see it above $50 unless WSB decides to spend all month making memes again to help get the boiler room bubbling again.
Plz
Passive income
Dis dick
Buy high, sell low, inverse WSB, not that fucking hard duh
Donkey Dong
I’ll pray for you. It’s two arrows per chart.
Oh, I see the GYNA bill is on mango's desk to sign. So either he will try to use it to get Xi to tell him he's the big boy or else he'll be a vindictive bitch and just sign it to fuk everyone else up.
Likelihood of another 100-200% jump is unreasonable. Likelihood of pullback is enormous.
Diversification is the key boys.

Instead YOLO NIO, spread to XPEV BABA LI AND NIO equally. Get that GENERAL TAO CHICKEN TENDIES!
Pig snort more like pug snot
As I was promised to get rich today buying into thicc boi - when can I call my employer and tell him to fuck off?
If it’s still around by the end it probably won’t be at 0?
Reasonable my dude. I hope you make 1000%
Would of been a gangster move
It'll rocket due to pent up demand for people to get out of the house.
Ogay
Got me all in the Feels with this one Bro. I could smell the Autodialers and Stale Marlboro Lights man. Good times , hope you find a new room to Slay in.
STOP I CAN ONLY GET SO HARD
Double dicks
“My portfolio is too diverse”

Best quote to show off what this sub is all about
Absolutely tanked earnings by almost 300%. 
It dropped by $50 last night and it all got bought up. 


You must be thinking of CRWD. They killed earnings.

No ARK etfs for me, straight up NNDM! Let’s goooo
TSLA another rise possible between now and 21st Dec. Thinking of buying in
SE is gonna push it today. I can feel it in my urethra
Imagine not sitting on a call today
The far right was right. Antifas don't know how to meme
All I see is arrows shooting off in many fucking directions up and down. If it goes up then get ready for it to go up - if it goes down then get ready for it to go down. OK got it bro.
Don’t worry we running out of jobs to lose the numbers should be good.
19,112

I'll take them odds, however close to zero they may be.
Due Diligence. Analysing a company to evaluate if it is worth buying or not.
Good time to buy
All I ask is for another CVS pump day.
CRM FEB 18 $240c got a YUGE gap to fill :) 💸💸💸

Looks like my TSLA Calls gonna print. Should have bought more 🤦🤷🏻‍♂️

Big Short? More like the pig snort am I right

You must be new here.
PENN will have a physical sportsbook inside greektown casino in Detroit.  Also,  their massively successful app is only available in 1 state so far.  They definitely have room to run.
NKLA is going to 0 by end of 2021

Change my mind
Double downs
And this only accounts for the straight up shares. If it squeezes all those cheap OTM call options become shares as MM will be forced to buy the increasing delta. Should make another where we can add our call positions/strikes
Nice
I feel like if it passes the house the weed stocks will boom. I think its possible. Dems have the majority and support by Republicans is much stronger than you think. In fact most of the big weed investors are conservatives and historically conservatives want less laws. Being sandwiched between 2 legal countries (Canada and mexico) is going to supremely complicate enforcement. Also half the states its legal in some way. Hell in the town i live in Texas you can hold up to 4 ounces and only get a ticket. Thats a quarter pound! With Trump rumored to do a "u.s. companies can't deal with anyone using slave labor" order I think thats going to complicate the use of the prisoners in the u.s. more than anything which marijuana laws have been used to fill up the prisons. Also Trump has stated he doesn't think it should be federal law, thinks it should be up to the states so he'll most likely push senate to get rid of the law not necessarily endorse pot. Biden on the other hand is extremely against legalization. Lots of private prison, alcohol, lawyer lobbists also in the mix so who knows. I'd say its 50/50 and not the no brainer its going to fail as most here think. Ending the war on drugs will save a lot of money and state and federal taxes will provide a windfall of revenue. I know a lot of people say "yeah right, the weed guy is really going to pay taxes". No the big guys will come in, take it over. You'll be paying taxes on it just like with cigs.
Still cheaper than check cashing place fees
Do you know how many times I’ve held and got
Burned on this company over past cpl years lol
1 year with calendar spreads the entire time.
Oh no, I absolutely agree with you there. But road transport is one of the biggest (if not biggest?) demand for fossil fuels. But that there still we be demand for other sectors is true. However, losing a large portion of ‘market share’ reduces the demand for the petrodollar (i.e. USD). I’m looking at it from a ‘how can America repay foreign debt with depreciated currency and lower dollar demand’ perspective

Meme status rising
Jobless claims today
I thought it was like 6%
R u retarded
Fuck SQ
FUCK THAT. YOLO
Still up 50%
Crowd strike or BA, free up more cash
Fucking a almost yolod
It’s backed and used by two governments. It’s being bought left right and centre in secret from the same institutions that are downgrading its price. 

It’s signs point to mooning, I like that the noodles are gonna be left behind. Doubled down on shares yesterday, my average is $18
priced in until it isnt
No guidance
Nio
If your theory is correct, as soon as the majority does that, FDs will be more attractive, thus reverting to the current "stable" condition.

615-630. Definitely usurping the ATH.
What sort of volume is this?
Anyone know what DD means?
If 🍏🍏🍏🍏🍏🍏🍏 gets over 124.40, it’s over.
They’re down in after hours 2.65% erasing yesterday’s gain. 
Got some puts qued!
Alright
As long as the smooth brains outnumber the pussies then the pussies won’t win the vote to sell off like they did
I had TSLA 12/4 600c that I sold yesterday for small profit instead of holding overnight. FML
So thats why SPOT pumped
Fuck $SQ, sold 12/4 210c yesterday at 200 to cut losses because of IV being so low.

market is future looking, you missed the rona play back in march
Wow, actually wow
Anybody play SNPS earnings?
PLTR wait until under $20. You are fighting big money shorts
How is that not considered market manipulation? Wtf lol I ain’t complaining but that’s pretty corrupt imo.
Just think about what SPY is composed of so it kinda makes sense
There's really no history that supports fundamentals not mattering in the long term. Peep the weekly charts for markets 1999-2000 and compare them to now. The Buffett indicator is actually higher than it was then
12,345
My local bank charges poor people a $6 monthly fee if their account is below $1500. How is that shit even fucking legal? I’ve been using Schwab checking for half a year while my local bank keeps racking a negative balance. You played yourselves because I’m not paying shit
*J K Simmons laugh from Spider Man*
wsb gal I think is gril but have not been seent lately. Maybe blew up account. 99% dudes here pretty sure
Quad witching?
The way GME is set up today is so juicy

Earnings run up starts today.  The squeeze is just gravy of it happens.  Don’t even need the squeeze with this breakout
Neither does Nancy, can’t believe she said no to 2.2 trillion and is now schilling the 900 billion bill...how is this woman not getting killed
No problem, retard! Ill get back to you and say this didnt age well when pltr hits all time high!

Cunts predicting a DL stock to zero when it has a valuation of 44bn - fuck you guys
No to both of your statements lol.
I am not going to be able to to focus if pltr reaches 25 today...I wrote yesterday that I will donate $200 if it reaches 25 and I will stick by it
Would be happy with 610
No way MM let all those 12/4 600c print

Tesla has ALWAYS moved violently. I can totally see this lol.
LOL
How do you retards plan to lose money today?
Yeah lol so wouldn’t that be bad?
 he's not wrong.   The only reason I can think that GS did this is because they have options expiring and the stock was in a downtrend.    Explain to me, with a straight face, how someone can say Tesla is worth more than Visa and Berkshire Hathaway.    It's unthinkable given their current price, but here we are.  Thanks for tendie town GS I grabbed 12/11 630c yesterday at the low.

Oh my. Aapl has finally broke through my average cost. .22% after holding these shares for months.
Record coronavirus deaths + cases = Record SPY levels

Love this fucking market - who knew a pandemic would be so good for stocks
Agreed from a fundamental standpoint. I mean I could be wrong, hence why I didn’t throw that much money into it
What’s TSLA prediction for EOD
I said “even less demand” literally everything I listed was terrible for oil (aside from more production cuts in a save it from death type good) so naturally this market will pump it off this news. No reason for it to be in the $30s at this point $40s is hilarious.
There's going to probably be a solid rebound to 24/25 and consolidate there is what I'm thinking. But I also have 15 12/14 22.5 calls I bought at 3:59 yesterday so I may or may not be biased :)
Lmfao, better then yesterday
no they are blue, im in desktop chrome and they're fucking blue
Sounds like my ex wife. Like a board with waterballons tacked on.
already loaded up, let's gooooo!
-6% last 3 months 🤔🤔🤔
I just want confirmation that FOMO TESLA calls will print. When are we hitting 700?
You mean they return money to the ones that paid it?
paltards sippin cappuccinos with they pinkies up
What’s pumping AMD? I want to get in but that stock has done me dirty too many times
Yeah, I had 40 CFD shares of Tesla pre-split (200 post-split) with a cost-basis of $50 post-split, $250 pre-split. 

I **could** have had **$120,000 before I left high school**. Instead, I sold out most at around 350 pre-split (+- 70 post-split).
Haha right.

What’s the deal with Luminar Tech (LAZR)? Going public today
Why is everyone shilling Chinese ev? Confused ab the news and seeing bulls
rip my pltr puts i bought yesterday 🤡
You don’t need a tutorial. You are basically looking for options that have a strike price greater than 50% of the current price and with an expiration date within the next week. Then just buy and hold.
Didn’t it blow earnings away
Sounds like julie
I mean if you think something is gonna go up then you're gonna invest money in it. He's probably not thinking of when he'll sell it because that's what us dumbass short time horizon traders think.

Get out of here with your logic and common sense! WSB moto, Yeet it, beat it, repeat it.
It was at about $10 at the beginning of November and it peaked at about $30 before thanksgiving.  That’s 200% increase in 3 weeks,  with that level of gains many investors will sell some or all of their position to take profit.  That large amount of selling will cause the value to stall and drop, when it started to drop, more investors sold as they wanted to take as much profit as possible, and some investors that bought at say $30, panicked as the value dropped and they sold to minimize losses.    And here we are today at $23.  I believe it is a good long term stock, and am going to hold my shares, I have a few options that are still in the money and will hold them until last minute as I believe it will start to climb again today or tomorrow.

Tesla is the only option.
Also if you think about it cheaper dollar means foreign investors can purchase more than before. Same thing as US goods becoming cheaper, works the same for securities.

We have offices in Shanghai, Singapore, Quindong, and surprisingly also in South Korea we need lawyers. Recently an Hyundai affiliated company (edit: i might have to delete this, might be too sensitive) made a patent for a small part of our system available, and it was a true copy to its core.

We're in the marine transport business (to put it broadly), and installments are usually done in China, South Korea, Japan, and sometimes Russia.

We're located in Europe.

Thank Chinese Elon
PENN is less than 5% off its highest price ever. It's now double from where it stood prior to the rumblings of its acquisition of Barstool. And that represents a buying opportunity to you?

MGM might be a good buy since they actually have a casino in Detroit and it's still recovering from the hit it took in March, but if you were going to get in, you've missed your 6-month buy window pretty considerably

DKNG could be good since they just started a sponsorship with the Pistons, but they also bumped their Q4 earnings guidance a few weeks ago, and leagues are beginning to get pretty fucked up thanks to rising Rona cases. The price got a nice 15% bump from that revision, but if they miss that mark, I could see it dropping by easily 1/3 if not more.

Your mom gave me a heads up last week
Dollar tanking means stonks and other assets go up, as well as exports become more attractive. However it makes it more difficult to repay foreign debt. As there’s still demand for petrodollar, it’s I guess ok. But in 10 years.. well...
The “up 0.52%” thing? 😛

you realize the market is generally up this week so far yes?
This actually makes a ton of sense.

If there’s a way to make easy money someone’s gonna do it. I’m skeptical the only reason SoftBank stopped was because investors didn’t like it...

Remeber tho. Goldman knows the Tax payers money will save them. Its a risk free bet.
ughhhhhh
AMZN has break up problem because they're so dominant.  If WMT+ gets even a tiny amount of traction it will only serve to make AMZN's case for themselves to say they don't have a monopoly.  

And WMT a tech play?!!?  I don't see it that way at all.  I think when we're looking back at 2020 a few years from now the phrase, "But no, you don't understand, it's a tech play" will be synonymous with whatever bubble is in the process of setting up to burst.
Lol @globalist scam
Sometimes this place feels like a men’s locker room. I’ve heard of lady autists, but I don’t think they exist.
ok I am holding my balls 

And have my pltr calls 

Lets see

1 more day till expiration
WSB retards Buy call’s in 3,2,1 🤦
Keeping it down for us retards at open - re load boys before it’s too late🚀🚀🚀
A naval blockade is a declaration of war. Against a country with a nuclear triad.
[removed]
Which is why I don't trade any of this trash!
Y’all got anymore of that GME confirmation bias?
Alright boys BA clearly on its way back to mid 300
I sold them last week for finally a small gain. I was thinking about buying some again with a slightly higher strike, I feel like I don't have patience for it and need something with a smaller market cap that has more room to grow MRNA and NVAX were scary this week though.
*they hated him because he told the truth* fuck it 12/18 800c
Who’s ready for some green today and tomorrow?

Thoughts?
It’s cause the 600’s contain potential for 696.9 price so stonk gets PE and blows its load early
His ass
Good for you dude!  I fucked myself this week.  Had GME weekly that I held on too long and only gained $1,200 instead of the $7k I was up for a minute.  Then fucked up TSLA calls.  So I went from $60k to $70k to $38k this week. 😩
Likewise, there are a ton of the US born students at the college I went to that had no idea about some of the atrocities the US government has done too. Kinda sad
Should’ve done it yesterday but they’ll print especially in January with Nio day
The transition to EVs won’t immediately end fossil fuel consumption. Trucks, ships, aircraft, power plants, etc. will still require fossil fuels for the for The foreseeable  future.
Very optimistic but it is a long play. May take a couple months.
ok boomer
Soon. Very soon. Especially if it finds support at 600 IMO.
Nah I'm chillin I ain't fighting Tesla til it cracks with bad market headwinds on top of it.

Gonna be a fun short tho. Below 300 at some point
Is this a sell the news event for TSLA? Holding weeklies
Where's the market going today? Upvote for green, downvote for red.

PS: we could do with a daily poll on this thread.
Sell calls. They have like super sweet premium right now. In 3 days? Maybe less so
When do you think the dollar will hit support?
Holy fuck I knew your mom was free 🅱️ussy but I didn’t think it would be that easy.
Was hoping to buy since I missed yesterday’s drop
USA will likely b fuk in the next decade or so

This was full sarcasm ask your girl over she’ll tell you I wasn’t soft... also maybe delete your comment history before you say sum
Buy a lot today bro please you’ll thank yourself
The hope will keep pltr going.
Now you’ll be excited to hear my PT from charts is 70 next Friday that’s with no news
Shit's funny yo
Lol limited risk
The fuk? Hell no
Oh snap what Twitter
I assume this ETF would only buy call or puts weeklys of itself?
$10k in NIO March calls at open fuck it
🤡
Probably a lot more likely you’re wrong. But ok!
In the example I gave of a hospital they aren't, but there is a substantial moat around their government contracts. They have connections that other companies just don't have, and trust. Other companies that are knee deep in data (like Google) do not have the same kind of relationships that Palantir has with the government, so that's one part of the moat. The new director of national intelligence worked for Palantir... that should tell you they'll have a monopoly on anything like this -- none of the competitors in the gov space have even compare to them.

What they've got going over other government contractors? they have legit talented engineers, which is unfortunately hard to come by in that space!

For new private sector business? I think the talent can play into it too. It's speculative, but I'm willing to bet.

You could've said the same thing about facebook you know... what did they do that myspace and friendster didn't?? It's network effects.
If you can eliminate the "ifs" in your trading, you'll be more forgiving, resulting in more tendies printing. Too many times I succumbed to the "what if" scenario. Slowly realizing this "if" situation can make you a zombie trader as in you become fixated on the perceived outcome that was supposed to be while missing the next opportunity. No more
Getting March or may calls at open
I was in at 14.50 1k stonks. Thanks bruh
I wanna legit yolo
Bullish af, they said they r aware of the new rule and have become compliant over the past few months so they r willing to play ball
$LAZR instead
this sideways Premarket PLTR is scaring me soldiers 😳
They will be forced in I believe the next 20 years probably less look at Venezuela, to put the dollar against magical mag coin and by then it’ll be way over 100,000k etc
Why do you say that
A generation ago this was the norm dude. Millenials are all spoilt with an illusion of choice so you think you always have better options but rather the one in front of you is probably your best bet and you should work on it.

This is why your grandparents have childhood sweethearts and our generation cant fckn decide /swipe right on tinder. They just accept that who they have/what they have is amazing and we're too busy comparing people. Its one of the reasons why people are perpetually single and struggle to find meaningful relationships.
CRSR the next RKT?

alright, high quality meme posted for the boys in celebration of my 2 week ban being over, lets go boys. today gonna be WILD
Opec today. Gonna announce more production cuts, larger inventories, even less demand, no recovery until 2025 and oil will board a rocket to $50. Get your calls.
Holy shit. What is the company doing to combat this?
And people keep buying them up ...
1.4B
IDK man. I really enjoy talking to you and think you are leaps and bounds ahead of me in this game. But I have to ask, do you ever think you may overthink things and look too deep?  Or do you think people like me who are just gambling and going off gut feeling are ruining this market?  Genuine question btw as I really respect your opinions
You think it’s gonna dump today too ?
GM PALTARDS
The majority of CVS's revenue comes from Aetna.. the COVID vaccine would barely give CVS a 10% bump..
TSLA smashing thru 590s right now. Think it might hit 620 today?

Amzn. Phenomenal earnings.  Barely budged.
How are we feeling about NIO rn with this massive green candle?
I'm still laughing about the dude who lost his mom 20K tell her about this stock!!  LMFAO
I always sell in the morning when I’m up and then it continues to moon. I think I’m going to try to hold on for once. I have 4 600c 12/4. Could be great if it hits 610
Lmao 🪦
China doesnt care.
It just got upgraded to pre split 3800 by Goldman Sachs
exactly, there’s mad people into stocks rn anyway so you’ll always find someone

My cost basis per share is $55, elon treats me well
There will be a lot of tears tomorrow, too many people bought 12/4C. Once these expire then we are loading that beast up with some rocket fuel.
The gov't literally has the money machine goes brrrr
or pump so hard at open, the WSB bulls buy the top, again, then sell at the bottom of the dip...as usual
I would be down for that. If not I am just holding through earnings and the inevitable tank..
Good for you!  My brokerage account is down 40% thanks to my TSLA calls going so red. 😬
100 shares of Citibank and sell covered calls weekly
SPY 10:1 split when?
I too enjoy watching the entirety of civilization hinge on the balance of a few big companies with enough money. 

Softbank's actions will be seen as tiny when it's revealed what other players have been doing
SPY either mooning or flat today. Nobody has the desire to sell it seems. There aren't even fake futures dumps anymore. Pure rally all the time.

I can only tell you I've lost a ton of money in the market. I've made so many bad mistakes. And what happens is you get afraid. If you ever watch an old person walk across the street and you're like why are they so careful why do they walk so slow. Because they falling down so many times. Because I've been on my phone walking and falling down. As you get older your body can't handle the stress of falling. So you become a coward. when you're young you're invincible you can fall down everyday 10 times a day and you feel nothing. If I step off the curb it hurts my body if I'm not ready for the shock. That's how brittle people get as they get older. And I'm only 51 years old. I'm not going to live deep into my '70s. It makes you frightened

You only ever hear about how much they won. They’ll never tell you they lost $2k in a slot machine before it paid out a $1200 jackpot. You’ll hear about the $1200 they won though.

Been telling y’all to buy GMHI for a week
the down charts are blue u might be colrblind
Oh come on man the bait was so obvious...
OK now I'm paranoid because she's made a bunch of sells for some stocks I'm holding... But they're not like huge sells, just a few thousand shares here and there.


But what reason would a fund have to sell regularly? I thought ARK would be a long term hold kind of fund? Almost seems like she's daytrading...
No...  I’d buy it while it’s red and sell it later in the day when it barely hits green.  Make a quick, easy 20%.
....
Really thought DG would trade flat. Straddle worked Tuesday and closed yesterday. 
Should have held the puts. 

They plan on opening 1000 more stores. 
There are 11 stores within a 5 mile radius of me today. lmao. 

Dollar General coming to my front yard soon.
Drill at open is a given.
Someone’s buying these bags with high hopes and a smile on their face. I’ll see who it was in a week or two on the loss porn.
I will personally fly to China and Kowtow infront of Mao's picture, if BABA moons today
Where were u monday
it means stocks go up. When the dollar is up, more investors tend to go cash gang since its more valuable. It works the other way around too
Goddammit you’re exactly right
Kirk Cousins nightly routine
Yes but not as green as my 12/4 calls. Hoping for a 200%+ day
I think the clue is in the phrase  over leverage
LIFETIME SUPPLY OF WENDY'S
Where’d you get those numbers I’m curious
Tell her boyfriend to keep doing what hes doing.
People buy the rumor, sell the news. Once vaccines start happening, you don’t the Kramer and the masses will signal a buy on this type of stock?
I have no interest in using Robinhood.  But damn if they didn't change everything.  The ability to buy stocks without fees(that we see at least) totally changed it all.  These days sometimes i just buy a single share or two on a red day to add to my large holdings.
Nice timing. 7% 🆙 in Europe.
>Palantir isn't going anywhere

You're right. $25 end of year. I'll be wheeling to take that IV.
We’re not going to tank until the dollar hits a support that it feels good at like 90.5 or even the three year lows at 89~88
Once the dollar begins to rally the market will see a pretty large tank IMO 
But until then we’ll continue to slowly grind up or stay relatively flat
[try this](https://www.tastytrade.com/tt/learn?locale=en-US)
How you'd respond to any 12 year old, obviously.
Even if it hit $25 I would be overjoyed.
Who gives a fuck we don’t print more brrrrr
Lol. He is such a stooge.
F
I just found out what dd means. Yea I shouldn’t be doing options. Lmao.
Take out $9k and do it again. If you can do it again you know you're doing something right. If you lose it all you still have $9k
You really think NIO is going up to $50 by tomorrow?
They go up because NOWHERE IS SAFE

Fair enough! Makes sense. Growth is certainly doing well.

The company I work for routinely gets patents sent to us that regard our own design. Sometimes the patents include full cutouts of our documentation - with our logo still on it.

We regularly see our clients with our product, but we never remember them ordering/installing. Only when they come in for service do we notice that: *"wait a fucking minute, what are these machine details?"* , and find out we never installed it in the first place.

Not even changing the design - unquestioned, true copy.

It is ridicolous.

PLTR was valued $15-$20 Billion already way back in 2015. Even arm of CIA has invested in it. Retards here who think companies like Deliotte can get PLTR contracts are idiots. Stick to whatever you are doing if you don't understand how relationships work and analytics software by PLTR. In 2020 investing landscape is totally changed.
PLTR is much more than its current market cap.

My crystal ball says $PLTR Run up to 24-25 today.  Drop to 20 by eow.  I'm selling at the top today and buying back in on Friday.
I got nothing against them. Killed it on their merger. My issue is SP drilled to the other side of the planet.
Why it's not zero
CRSR primed to bounce back any time. Numerous analyst price upgrades. Still has a cheap market cap compared to its "competitors". You guys were too blinded by Pltr to see it the first time and your about to miss it again

Yeah I swapped my puts for calls this week. I’m not even a good 🏳️‍🌈🐻
We live in a world that does not care about accounting. Stocks rise and fall for reasons that have nothing to do with actual cash flow. It's called bugs Bunny numbers. That bugs Bunny could hit a thousand home runs in one inning. I tried to do value back in '09 2010 and 2011. Growth has destroyed value. And I do not think value is coming back anytime soon. Because the masses don't buy value stocks. Look at the earnings per share for AIG. It makes way more money than its market capitalization. Something is fishing in the world.  


I passed the CPA exam all four parts in 1992. And I've lost a lot of money in my life. I am at a point where I want to make 10% a year for the next 11 years That's my goal and I'm not going to do it buying value stocks

Everyone is trading companies who are making the vaccines (respect) but nobody is thinking about the companies who will administer them, which will happen soon I imagine.

TSLA hates the 600s. Not sure why. Always blows through them or skips entirely.
Looking into a certain Nugget that's Golden. It's trending number one on a certain Twitter of Stocks. The ticker starts with an L and ends with an A with a C between them.
This is the way for retards like me!  I only acquired,  5 12/4 40C calls, I thought I was going to lose my pension, so I sold!  Now totally bored, watching Netflix, I miss the emotions, the making me feel like I was alive, in this total bullshit situation with this China FLU,  unfortunately with no knowledge, with a more than a six figure salary, I thought that grand I lost was a big deal, they weren't ,  they made me happier than,  when I went to the Louvre in Paris , Or The London Eye, I had more fun in a weekend with PLTR,  than my wife dragging me around the Roman Catacombs!  France and the Countryside was definitely more than this PLTR high!  My PLTE loss, has taught me, how it feels to be alive again!  Thank you PLTR! Don't forget I'm a total Newbie Retard, I just loved being in the in crowd for a change!  I really enjoy all you fukin retards shitpost!

You're going to hear about HEXO and APHA, but the real play is GRWG
I have this note in my phone I must’ve written last weekend when I was high. Says “A lot more YouTube ads lately. ALOT. Google? Options calls”.
Without R support its dead in the water
Tsla is the most stressful calls to play. Yesterday drops to 548 then magically overnight opens over 590. Like a stock falling 30-40 absolutely wrecks options even if it’s A few weeks out. These paper hands can’t handle it :(
What time is the vote?
Never had a flu shot, never had the flu motha fucka
Apple doing that thing
I really wanted to see that guy eat shit
Xi and Don will create a nice joint-checking account and start paying out refunds. You guys lucked out.
As is tradition lol
Getting higher
Not so weird when you think about how it was circulating from Oct or Nov until March and no one noticed or cared until the media freaked out about it and created a panic. We'll see if these politicians are willing to give up control.

Travel stocks pumping with fda approval imminent.

PLTR has this pattern of either going up a little and holding then tanking hard, then recovering a bit. So I’ve been selling calls at the beginning of the day, closing out on the big dip, then re selling calls on the jump. 

I could just hold the cc and not close but I’m sort of daytrading these movements and hoping to not have CC on in the case of a real rip.


Your reasoning makes more sense
In for this
Stock price too high IMO

They 100% had the opportunity to do so. Snowden confirmed they did, with details on targets. Have a look at the links posted in reply. I said they were better at hiding it for a reason....
Could be a multi year hold, looking at 50+ if they can secure a deal with a legacy car company or Tesla

Yes.  Most likely will have to to continue working (healthcare)
Original talks were between House and Mnuchin. The 900b figure is the GOP Senate preferred bill. They explicitly do not want direct checks to Americans.

Really even if Pelosi caved to the exact bill proposed by Mnuchin it probably wasn’t passing the Senate.
No I don't take the flu shot - I'm not a pussy and my healthy body is more than capable of fighting the flu and corona. All those at risk or elderly etc are more than welcome to protect themselves.
Honestly any EV besides Tesla is still potentially the next NKLA. None of them are profitable.
This feels like the paper trading contest

I fucking hate people who ask what to buy in Facebook or Telegram groups. If they make money they won't share gains with you. If they lose money they bitch and moan about the person who gave them the tip. Whenever someone asks for what to buy I either ban them outright, or tell them to buy SPY calls depending on my mood.
Hope amd has 1 more giant pump left
Hell no. Apparently its very painful. Id rather cough for a week then purposely feel like dog shit

Lmao fuckin rekt by a boomer, honestly love to see it, welcome. Also Here’s my millennial 2 cents on PLTR... in 2017 I met a few users of one of Palantirs products at a trade show and they were there to demo other products and prepare for a new software procurement so in the idea of fair competition they demod like 8 or so competing softwares. All Very very large companies except palantir and all 4 of these users were telling me (cause I was the youngest guy at the trade show and we were just vibing at the bar late)  about how much superior palantirs product was than anyone else’s and how it wasn’t “even fucking close”. Light years ahead in analytical capabilities. 

That’s all I needed to know, I was waiting for this ipo for 3 years. 

Positions: 

Holding 3000 shares @ 9.70 and will buy more if this dips below $20! $15 is the true price in the short term IMO. 
Had 12/18 $20 calls sold at $29 and made a killing. after the retards here pumped this thing, once it lost momentum from 30s I knew it was coming back down.
JFC.... dude is probably doing this to cover taxes. Chill the fuck out.
No, I have ZM calls! I need to support them!

JK - I don’t have ZM calls but probably won’t get the vaccine at first because I had coronavirus and it wasn’t too bad. :-)
You can't pump something that's so deflated.

Hold it for another month then get rid of it.
Idk that’s why I put potential. NKLA was or is valued in the billions and has no product, revenue or business to show for it. Seems pretty high on the list of schemes.

Agreed but sometimes the stock you want might moonshot above the put strike price & you miss out on those gains you would have gotten if you just bought the shares

Yes, why wouldn't you?

Why would you not? You take the flu shot, no? The vaccine is fighting a virus IMMENSELY more stable.

The last time I bought SPWH based on DD here I watched the price decline like 40% in 3 months and then took a loss. Good company but fuck this stock.
Dude you called it
Robinhood doesnt even let you trade options accurately.
Example. If i buy a LEAP on PLTR at $15 strike at 1/22..... i should be able to sell calls against this contract. 
But cant. Have to own underlying shares. Even though i could technically execute the call order at anytime and sell against it. 
Robinhood is great but like the real story, they never give you enough info.
It should display a black screen and the message "you died" every time your account hits zero
It’s just funny cus it do in fact be hittin lately ...
If Chinese stocks are delisted, what happens to the shares you hold?
yes
Lol
Do we think this will pass? How are you playing this?

Are you all going to take the vaccine when it comes out?
Well any ticker you want that has options.
Nice.  Weird times
it'll probably work out
If you wanna talk on those terms then what is more important: an internet data mining company or the utility company that powers everything around you?

Right now energy companies left and right are trading at insanely cheap valuations as if natural gas and oil are going out of business next year or something. Yet people are defending a company trading literally 1,000x more expensive than bedrock companies of our society.

And don't even get me started on TSLA. I love papa musk and made some money with them but you have to get a whole PhD thesis on bullshit to justify their current valuation.
Cvs will be a vaccination center tho
RIP anyone who lives in LA these next few weeks
This is bad news. It went up 200% when rated neutral,  40% when rated buy. Go back to neutral!

If my DD and prediction comes true, I will have to trust myself more.
Prediction from last week for PLTR:
Giant sell off from last Friday to this Wednesday.
Thursday: sizeable bump up.
Friday: sell off (smaller).
Monday to Wednesday next week: moon to 40.
Thursday to January: dump to 12.
wonder how jobs will be, not that the market cares anymore

This is just an opinion, not advice, but here we go: 

I theorize that CVS and Walgreens will be two of the major players that distribute COVID vaccines. Although the vaccine will be free to people, similar to flu shot, the stores will probably be paid from the government for the distribution and logistics management aspect of the vaccine. It’s just a thought. But additionally, if we have another lock down, CVS is a store that would remain open (hashtag, essential). It would still ruin the stock price for my calls, but, might have better Q1/Q2 numbers than most if there is indeed another lock down.
26.80c on PLTR 12/11 hold or sell?
You missed a wild ride up and a apocalyptic fall for a meme stock. So the monthly special around here. Dont listen to anyone that's trying to sell you PLTR right now
Your bum doesn't have a hymen.
PFE 42c 12/11 here, you?
This is the answer I was looking for ! Thank you.
The hardest part is holding for longer than you feel comfortable with. Feels like every time I sell something the price dramatically moves in favor of what I just sold.. Looking at you Tesla

Buy TSLA
Chocolate or strawberry
1100 shares at 10.00 on day one what's uppppp
If PLTR is going to go for new highs it’s going to be Monday or early next week.  Weekly options are expiring on Friday which keeps the stock from going up a lot.  Support in PLTR is at 22.
Are you pretending to tell a future that has in fact already happened??? like a fucking loser ?
fortunately we can count on Chinese data protection to be 1000x less competent
PFE anyone?
Sir, this is WSB.
We got few millionaires and maybe around 10k homeless at this point
Sell APHA today and buy after vote dip? Too obvious of a play?
If you have cash ready to buy shares if a stock tanks why not just sell puts. You either get premium or shares like you wanted. Win win

All of us who are still profiting should be thankful because a lot of people are in the negative. Good luck today autists
Just $20K
I’m very, very bullish on TSLA but they make major swings.  If it hits +$25 at 10-11am, you can sure believe it will drop down to +$20 (at a minimum) for a period.

I think its great long term but will probably be awhile before it really moons. I try to grab some shares here and there on dips.
PLTR gang needs to evolve into PLTR co-op: each week, 1/3 buy calls, 1/3 buy puts, 1/3 go theta gang. Contribute earnings into a pot and split evenly

Dems wanted 3.4 trill. Republicans kept saying no we only want 500b maybe we would do 1trill. Then right before election they caved and said okay we would do 1.8t. Nancy thought they could play hard ball and either have gop cave or win the senate in the election and pass a 3.4t. They lost and since then mitch has only offered 500b despite things getting worse. Refusing to even negotiate. This 900b is actually hella misleading too cuz its only 300b of new money and 600 is left over from first stimmy
NO!

No because when you use robinhood they take your 30 bucks and then buys another share from market and they keep the difference.

Got proof? What I've read said the Chinese government outlawed submitting to international regulatory authority. Nio is commonly listed next to Alibaba as being one of the big movers that could get delisted.
If anybodys getting tired of crazy yolos, amazon call spreads for the end of the month are a solid short term play.
This is great work.
Says the one that can’t spell definitely
When I was in grad school ~10 years ago I worked in science research labs and some of the labs were occupied by almost 90% foreign Chinese “students” here on visas. After some time in the graduate program they’d go home to visit China and get “stuck” for months. I never understood at the time why they allowed so many foreigners taking up prestigious limited spots in the graduate class, but now I know why. They pay big bucks to attend our universities here. Years later, we find out that they’d been stealing formulations and IP from the university. I’m glad the government has finally realized this and is cracking down on the “students”.
Holy fuck SIG. I remember some autistic DD on them back in July pitching puts when they were in the $10 range
^
will amount to nothing , and even if it does , your still able to hold it for 3 years...... i own 0 nio and have no interest in it.... just stating the facts
What should I do with my 12/4 40c
I heard the same thing on nio at 25. Good luck with your puts.

The risk of writing a put vs writing a call isn't the same just 'reversed' as you put it. Selling a call has infinite risk, selling a put has clearly defined risk thats lower than infinity. One is way riskier than the other. And you used the term max loss for a scenario that wasn't max loss. Stopped reading after that I'm sure there are plenty more errors. This reads like you just spent 30 minutes reading about these topics and wrote this, rather than actually having an understanding of some of the concepts youre explaining. Am I close?
Michael Burry
Reading that in my head made me LOL.
Yes. I legit had a dream PLTR was going above 33 the day after the massive short announcements. Wasn't worried about my stake. If it doesn't go up by Dec 4 then I will deffinately lose about 6.5k. And if it doesn't go up at all from now til jan 15 2021 ill lose the other 32k. I've heard of good dreams being translated as something bad will happen tho. Like a dream of a family member giving birth meaning someone in the family is actually ded.. so if we can collectively dream about pltr dying then theres a superstitious possibility that it will do the opposite.

When did PLTR ever rise 400%?  That would put it at $40.  

We rose 200% and with the 35% drop we are at a 131% rise since IPO.
Pickup 3 NIO $47 12/04 calls.  It’ll pick back up and possibly see green sometime during the day

My dumb YOLO was I got a bit of FOMO and dropped 1500$ on some 32$ 12/4 calls when it was at like 31.50....seemed like a good idea at the time >\_<

This meme is great. I also can’t believe I sold all my options last Wednesday for like $600% profit at the perfect time... 10 years of experience losing money on options that were once up 500% I guess is starting to pay off.
Price action for PLTR in premarket is the exact same as the previous few days. Down we go
Which ones?
Prob hookers and blow
So if you had bought 2 shares you would still only have one share at $3.54?

Robinhood should embrace its mobile gameyness. Everytime your price goes up there should be little numbers that pop up like “+$23 XP” and when it goes up twice in a row, you get a combo and mad neon colored numbers flashing everywhere. +23 XP COMBO TRIPLE Every time you profit in a day you are awarded 1 day trade and extra health.
Because that is how math works.

If you subscribe to their newsletter you get an email every day.

Yet somehow the stock will see a 3% gain.  If something even remotely close happened to TSLA we’d see a 20% drop. Lol
Ah ok. So it is an art piece?

with you, wayyyy too much cuckoldry going on around here with a lot of talk and claim with no walk to back it up. This place is now literally filled with children who will say anything to look cool.

I think alternative smoking methods is where it's at.  Wax is the best because you can get a consistent quality every time.  If you just buy a bag if weed the potency can be very varied.  I'm looking for the company that is going to establish a recognizable brand where people can buy a product with consistent quality.  No company has established that yet.  The companies you suggested already have brand recognition and could establish them selves in the weed market.  I like your thinking.
I think there are going to be a decent number of active fund managers that BM to the SP at that point who will be desperate for any dip to get in. I don't think it will plunge as hard as people will expect it to, and I think that IV on the put contracts coming into the inclusion date will reflect your and everyone elses expectation of a plunge.
Bought majority of my stocks at 18. Then at 32 peak and when it dipped I bought more again at 26. I plan to hold long since I believe it will be worth a lot of money in the future. I'm not that bothered by the dip since I have stocks (option-trading isn't really a thing in my country). I think we will see greener times ahead.

Yolo your favorite meme. Probably GME calls
i am firing my lazr right at the moon boyos
*smooch*
lol @ wsb affecting ANY of these high volume stocks.
Literally just happened to me. Sold VALE calls up 100%

They're up 600% now
If my PLTR 30c 12/18 print I will post a pic of my sucking my big toe.... *passionately*
At least 10,000$ by monday
Can't beat the feds in this cool, legal market /s.
Aren't you that annoying chess spam guy?
Until like April and that's been the plan for awhile. Idk why everyone is pumping it right now 😂😂 gonna have to hold for a long time
NKLA tried to fuck over Bosch with GM, now they are getting fucked and are losing both partners. Bosch is getting out, as long as there still is a profit:

From the filing:

"On December 1, 2020, Nimbus (Bosch) sold an aggregate of 4,261,155 Common Shares and Nimbus, along with the other Reporting Persons, ceased to be the beneficial owner of more than 5% of the Common Shares Outstanding. "

Getting below 5% as well so that they can sell the rest discretely.
You're a bit behind the times aren't ya fella
He probably got bombarded by annoying people lol
Bought at 15, 16, 18, and 18.5. We holding.
I have no real authority either but I would like to nominate you
You're not alone. PLTR makes up a big part of my portfolio, but only because I have faith in the company and its leaders. I'm down about $8k just in the last week. I don't like being down but I know it's temporary. I'm also still in the green with it. I can already see moves being made on it. Big money just wanted to shake the tree to get a good position.

This got me a downpmt for a house back in September.
LETS GO BABY WE HERE

> bought at $10
Hopefully you dont get too many of the obligatory comments about IV crush on here. Good job buying low. I did the same intraday for a quick 25% return on ATM 23c
God I hope so. I hate that guy. Lol
I made my money in GE yesterday.... don’t fear “boomer stocks”. If your charting says it’s a buy, it doesn’t fucking matter what type of stock it is.
GUH
Does MSFT just suck balls now or am I an idiot for having faith in it?
Stim talks and jobless claims will set the stage today. Yesterday I got into TSLA 600c 12/4, BA 250c 12/18, NET 80c 01/15 and NIO 45c 12/18 💃🏽
Every once in a while I get the urge to do something extremely self destructive and buy BA puts. I should just cut myself a couple times instead
the only correct answer in this thread
I'm a new autist but wouldn't you have lost money? It was a 30 to 1 split. I had one share so I got a single share back since they prob had no fucking clue why someone bought a single. 19 share.
It's gonna do the same shit again. Premarket gains will evaporate in an hour and it'll be drill team 6 causing my chest pain for the rest of the day
Still contemplating. What are you thinking?
Apparently Tesla might go above 690? What gives.
I think Skywise will help guide it there
BABA 270 by end of the week?
Were you the bomber, or did you get blown up?
10497 weeeeee
If I buy 1 share at 30 does that count?
i dont think anyone or anything can sink this market now. May be a literal nuclear war, but otherwise we just gonna keep creeping up.
Got a bunch of 5 dollar calls yesterday.

Let's go!
Like Im holding these bags, baby!
Damn, I came all the way here to see how.
Why? Bought the dip yesterday. Making some money in the AM regardless.
It's going up.
Same nothing worse than panic selling then watching it climb back higher in legit a day
Today will be  a great reward for those that Diamond handed their Tesla Calls these past few days
This shmuck on CNBC just said ideas have been floated for Adobe and Microsoft to consolidate lmao wtf
I need to read the 1st tut first :(
Nukes themselves do not cause a nuclear winter.  The winter is caused by massive forest fires all over the world that are incidentally started when the nukes go off.

The trick still works because there are always new players
Bravo sir, take my upvote
Being a teenager fucking sucks, broke, can't have a job etc
I can't, but I won't bet against TSLA today.

PT upgrade and a deleted tweet.

This is gonna be fun
Looks like it was the right play
Praying for you brother! Hope you hit big
But all things considered it has to have been a great time for put sellers since March.
Because somebody told you it was going to doublep
The fact that we still have that many jobs to cut is the most shocking part about this.
I want to be a mod but my only permissions would be to hold people accountable to their bets, like that guy chugging hot sauce if PLTR hits 30 next week. I wouldn’t do anything else to actually help the sub. People would only tag me when a bet needs to be noticed.

Well that’s my mod application. Thanks for listening

Palantarinos how are we feeling today?
The more we print, the higher the inflation. The higher the inflation, the higher the interest on debts.
VXX is a horrible instrument to long volatility with. It is a naturally decaying ticker, it also has roughly a beta of 0.50 with the VIX, which means if VIX goes up 10%, it's expected to go up 5%, give or take a few %. if you want to long volatility, use VIX calls or VIX bullish spreads.
yeah, anyone who got in late last week, oof.   
i got in @ ipo. enjoying the (bumpy) rollercoaster. :D
Ugh same I’m so mad
The guy helping people get 2000%+ returns on a weekly basis by talking them into buying wedges and rolling into reverse diagonal spreads. This week I’m only up 40% with 10% invested in options. I usually aim for +200% weekly with 10% invested in a 80cash-10stock-10options with a 9:1 or 8:2 self leverage ratio.
Looks like SQ was the right play
michael burry twitter posts kinda cringe tbh
Splunk got dumpstered, holy fuk

50% of Business travel will  never return to pre pandemic level

I'd probably aim for 24-25 but once it gets around 23 I'll sell if it gets to 21.5

Thanks! Didn't know about this, will read up on it.
What are you holding?
Sold my Tsla $455 2/19 2 days ago. Looking at going back in for same expiry around $770.
Cant fix stupid

Bosch sold their stake on Dec 1, because NKLA tried to double cross them with GM. Now they are losin both partners lol. Reduced their stake to 4.9% so that they (thats my guess) are below 5% and can now sell without filing anything (?).
Print yes. Print big...? No.
Seriously i don’t know what to do in this market right now. It’s too expensive to open long positions but shorting this market is impossible since you instantly get bombarded with stimulus and infinite printing
I see, so its important to set an appropriate stop limit order to prevent missing out on those gains. Thanks!

This is my biggest position, primarily stock.  Been in for a year and half. What are your thoughts. Are you still buying at these prices? My average cost is 5.50 a share. Not usually a fan of averaging up. I see that chens fireside chat caused it to sink back down. Thanks chen.

Bear King Michael Burry in the ring, slappin TSLA with a metal chair. His glass eye open wide with rage as he batters TSLA relentlessly.

"The valuation..." *crunch* "makes...." *crunch* "NO.... " *crunch* "SENSE!" he roars with maniacal autistic glee.

TSLA struggles for the edge of the ring, but coughs blood as each hit lands, and eventually stops moving. Bear King Burry drops the chair.

*Bear King Burry turns to the crowd*

"Was this your champion!? Was TSLA supposed to be your *chosen one!?*"

*A child in the crowd turns his face into his mother's side and cries.*

On the side of the ring WSB can barely move. TSLA was supposed to tag them in, but couldn't make it to the side in time.

"Get up TSLA" WSB whimpers hopelessly, a single tear rolling down their cheek. "Get up..."

*Bear King Burry turns to WSB*

"Now it is your portfolio's turn. Get in here you little bitch."

"Excuse me." Someone replies from behind BKB. "I believe I can give you the fight you want."

A robed figure is administering smelling salts to TSLA. The figure puts TSLA on its shoulder and carries TSLA gently out of the ring.

"And just who the fuck do you think you are?" BKB rumbles ominously. 

BKB's fingers squeeze so tightly on the chair that metal bends.

"Who am I?" the robed figure inquires.

*The robed figure stands straight and stretches to their full height. They must be at least 7' tall.*

The crowd stops crying and watches in stunned silence.

"Who am I?" The figure repeats menacingly.

*The figure turns around to face BKB, ripping off his robe. A gleaming light fills the stadium. Before us stands a Golden deity, rippling with muscle. If there is an ounce of body fat it is currently in hiding, only to make way for seemingly endless coiled golden musculature.*

The figure looks directly into Bear King Burry's eyes.

"I'm Goldman Sachs, and i'm here to kill you."

Crm Tsla pltr aapl
Or:

TARD
I lost this amount today and yesterday lol. $2K ain't shit.
How much
to go down like in March
Explain to me how doing puts on TSLA after the print price for S&P inclusion is set does not equate to free money. That shit is going to drop 10% immediately. Short term, obviously.
Goldman Sachs raises Tesla target to $780 a day after Michael Burry announces he’s shorting the shit out of Tesla? 🧐 Revenge?
I think it’s shortsellers closing their Position
Gay.
The way premarket has been moving these past few days, i dont give af what happens bc as soon as the market opens it literally retraces and does a whole ass U turn after what it was doing premarket. No point in losing sleep anymore to watch premarket bc Nio fucking tanks ever morning regardless
Anyone playing MRVL earnings
You will lose your account, family and life attempting to short TSLA. I tried once, got puts right when Elon made famous tweet. Finished the day +150% opened the next day negative. Can’t even short that bastard when he wants you to.
Genius
Retarded
Chad's across the company weep at express missing on eps.
any interesting 1dte play today?
I'm over here praying for 5 but yeah double digits would help me dig out of my 6 digit hole.
Obviously but the chances of me becoming a millionaire at this point are slim to none. I could follow you autists and yolo what money I have on FDs but quite frankly I don't have the balls.
Honestly I bet Elon set up this whole bullshit with the bill just so he could get more people buying. I hate how manipulated the market is so many illegal things happen everyday but the rich can do what they want it’s so annoying
Dont talk to me or my PFE $60 Calls ever again

No foreign nationals are allowed in without a “babysitter” and that’s only for people from countries we are allies with, there’s a list of no go countries whose citizens aren’t allowed in for any reason (china’s on the list). It can get a little ridiculous, currently we have a team of Germans installing some equipment for the next 4 months and they’re not even allowed to go to the bathroom in our building without an escort.

Sell it as soon as you see a profit. I had calls all the way from May when I realized their vaccine would be the top. The stock has barely moved at all on all the hype. Everyone already knows the vaccine is getting approved - FDA has no choice at this point - even if the vaccine caused ppl's dicks to fall off, they will approve it. So, it's all priced in. The stock barely moves on good news but tanks hard on the smallest bad news.

However, PFE is a solid company who just has a bad history of crappy pipeline drugs. They have the same market cap, rev, stats as most other big pharma but their share price is like 1/10 of what it should be. In recent years, with the new CEO's strat, their pipeline is now looking pretty good and the next 5 years should see a nice increase in their share price. If you're the type to invest long-term.
Sorry sir im on the crsr boat

10 years ago planning and researching your drive.
The hype is indeed real, but from my experience analysts (and their PTs) are truely clueless. My worst fear is that TSLA pops (which again seems inevitable) and takes down all the sector with it.
Nobody tell him

If he’s mainly trading options then I don’t really see that as an issue. For me I use day trades as a last resort in case I make a bad decision and if he overtrades options anyway he’ll probably lose most of his money before PDT becomes an issue

I’m with you on this man but the stock got upgraded by some of the most stingy conservative low balling analysts and everything is pointing towards going up. The panic selling was already extreme as all hell so idk how much lower it could really go. I think people want back in knowing it a golden ticket

Facts. I was brand new and extra dumb back then, so I lost out on some money by prematurely selling and buying back in later, but netted a good profit off of them. But sheesh if I knew what I know now I would have made a truckload of money off tandem
I did two days ago. Have a 700c 12/18 Tesla call that has been anywhere from +15% to currently -45%. I’m scared
BOIL feeling the heat
Bought at $16, sold at $23. Bought some more when it fell to $27, looking for long term gain at 35$

Bought 75 shares average 16$, decided to grab an extra 25 at 33$. Learned my lesson on that one. Planning on holding for years though so not too worried about it. Was already looking to expand the position, fomo’d and expanded at the top.

Cost only matters if you're investing a little bit of money
Otherwise you're just looking for percentage gains despite the price of the stock

What year do you plan to be a millionaire? Honestly....I’m eyeing 2024 at the latest
It seems that due to the "special dividend" of $1.94 per share, and Rolls-Royce dropping to $1.50 the day of the dividend issue, and my setting dividends to reinvest automatically, I am now the proud owner of 6699.526 shares or RYCEY instead of the original 3000 I purchased.
I literally got scammed, too. I am waiting for a deadline and then report him and get my money back.

Elon really does want to do an offering but wants Tesla pumped to the max first. So he paid Michael (king gay bear) to announce he’s going short and have his army of gay bears join (fuel for 900->1800 squeeze 2.0) shortly after arranging this he tipped off GS they loaded in and announced the completely realistic and fair PT of $780. Now we have the Alpha Tesla bulls facing off against the dying malnourished down to their last put bears for the 2020 stock market finale.
Way to go. Makes no sense to sell now.

This is the most accurate depiction of how China used to work, and still does but to a lesser degree. Did you know they published more scientific papers than the USA? And while I hate the politics there, as far as authoritarian goes many in the USA want to emulate it's control level, I still think it's the future.
It’s seen as a step in the right direction. One step closer means the companies are more viable and share price should reflect that. Sure they’ll all go up 5000% and then settle down to a modest 10% increase overall, thus burning half this subs money in the process. But a modest bump in share price is reasonable if it gets passed.
This is why you still have a balance on your account. I've lost over $100k doing exactly what you fear. 90% of options traders fail so you're winning. It's all fun and games until you look back and realize you lost a down payment on a house in the span of 6 months.
The problem with this advice is the fact if OP follows it, he’ll no longer have day trading privileges. I would never recommend it, because with those privileges you can limit your risk in a much more controlled way, whereas a regular account (once you exhaust your weekly PDT allowance) has to wait until next day to close. So I say – keep the money there, just limit your exposure to 10k at any one time (or whatever you’re comfortable with).

Why not?
I sold all my shares of PLTR and TSLA yesterday and threw it all into GME. I'm fucking retarded aren't I?
Yeah, I bought willing to take the theta hammer until the 4th. I’ll be selling by midday today, after making sure nothing crazy happens. If it does spike down, maybe I’ll get something out of it. The insurance for yesterday was worth it, regardless.

Still new to options, but I am considering holding shares for covered calls. I just need to make sure I know what I’m doing.
My wife's boyfriend just texted me and said he is coming over to teach me a lesson
I was a junior in college in 2013. Been following Tesla since 2009. Owned 178 shares at $28...YOLO

Sold at $38 when a "journalist" wrote a hit piece about the Model S and being left stranded without a charge. Turns out, Tesla was smart and had remote monitoring capabilities of their reviewed cars and revealed the "journalist" fabricated the whole thing!

Unfortunately, i already sold my shares and didnt rebuy until $200/share in 2019 but sold at $870 in June 2020 after i recovered from the March crash.

Big difference between missing out on money made vs losing money like OP though...
Hope Palantir goes up to 40 quickly. We have a guy that has to post a self-suck video, one that has to leave his girlfriend and one that has to eat his shit.
Over under for 30 days from today is set at $3,500.  Place your bets now.

I’m going with the under.
We're gonna get slaughtered to $20.
If PLTR drops to 15-16 range I'll buy in. I'm not sure that it's going to the moon yet! Maybe a month from now.

And most of those guides are don’t buy otm options, but if you can’t afford atm on something like tsla, what else are you supposed to do other than not play it, which probably isn’t happening here
And my bow
Lol, do the fucking math.  It comes out to a round number because ~~I'm lazy~~ I said it was compounded monthly.  It's also not an APR because of this.
China literally used German diesel engines in the Yuan class submarines, then hired German engineers to copy the design for themselves in 2013. Everyone copies the Germans, it’s just what ya do.

I mean the Americans literally invented industrial espionage in the 1800s during the industrial revolution. Everyone’s doing it!

I'm an odd man out for this. I bought 500 shares of PLTR because I've worked with them THEN found this sub. Now I have an interactive option gambling forum
It basically said he likes Tesla, but he’s going short and they should do an offering (lol the balls on this gay bear) to take advantage of their way over inflated share price.
They probably wanted pay back 😂 I had the same thought don’t mind one bit
So we thinking a 20% day for Tesla? That would be cool....

Definitely sounds good, but once again isnt that just using API's to integrate old softwares? I guess getting the old software's to output info the way you want could be tough. Zapier wouldnt be able to do that. But tbh why is that so unique? I'm not saying the business model is bad, it's definitely good, but I still cant see why it is so so special. It doesnt feel like a revolutionary process. It doesnt feel like it will change the business landscape forever. It does however sound like its gunna help overhaul old glitchy systems and bring them into this generation. But why cant someone else do the same thing? Why is pltr the only one who can do this?
How much in retard currency?
Yeah when you actually do your research but Chinese stocks have always been like this. Just like luckin coffee, but people forget over time and FOMO is one hell of a drug.

If you thought tornadoes and hurricanes were bad now just wait a couple years asshole. Have fun being disintegrated into the abyss.

You need to purchase before the ex-dividend date
Er, but if the stock can be taken at any moment then it's not going to go to $200. Why would someone buy a stock, hoping to make 10% if they can loose all their money? It doesn't make sense.

Imagine not buying PLTR yesterday at 13% off after some jackass downgraded it to get cheap shares.

It's technically limited to one day because all options that matter are running out the same day. However the full-blown nuts rallye that happens on rare occasions is usually just a couple of minutes.

Thank you very little. Just curious with such a large dividend. Stocks probably gonna be a bit volatile. Plus they just dipped because of slowing earnings. I don’t know but might have been a good entry with a $10 cushion

>	leech off our university system

Leech? More like pay full out of state tuition (which universities will and are gobbling up). How is that leeching? 

You don’t seem to understand how university research works. Nobody is handing out intellectual property at lectures, and research labs are required to publish their work if they are funded by federal money unless it would jeopardize national defense. If a foreign student is sniffing around an aerospace engineering lab or something like that, sure, that’s suspicious. In the current political atmosphere people are already alert to that, though. 

>	Most the Chinese kids I saw while at University were extremely well off and were able to afford ridiculous things even though they were already going to school overseas.

I don’t understand why you are surprised the people who can afford to go to school overseas also can afford a luxurious lifestyle. Are you surprised if someone who drives a Mercedes also has a nice set of golf clubs in the trunk? Oh my gosh, even though they already drive a Mercedes?! How?!

>	pretty blatantly obvious China is sending all their rich people’s kids overseas to leech off our universities

More like our universities have a MUCH better reputation than those in China. There are basically two or three there that even hold a candle to an average US university as far as reputation, and good luck getting in to one of those with China’s absolutely cut-throat competitive school system/culture surrounding education. Not surprising at all that those with money (probably more people in China than you want to accept) would rather come here than waste their time at a sub-par Chinese university. But nah, must be a concerted effort to get tens of thousands of spies into our university system, right? Those damned commie professors must be in on it too!

Comparing a lot of hotels to one single company isn’t exactly fair? . Has any hotel company hosted as many people in a night as Airbnb has? Airbnb profits off of other peoples  real estate instead of having to buy the hotel/house/room like the wonderful hotels in piss smelling London...  to me i see reduced liabilities and a user friendly app that allows me to stay in a nice clean home versus a possible smelly rundown room. 
Another thing we havnt mentioned is the cost difference between abnb and a hotel. Good luck sticking 10 guests in a hotel room when I can rent a whole 4+ bedroom house on airbnb for the same price of a single 2 bedroom hotel that has more than a 3/5 star review.
I don’t see the comparison here.

how large is your company and is all of your data neatly organized into cloud services?

consider a hospital: could you integrate all the data of a hospital to find ways to run it more effectively, using zapier?

this is the kind of thing palantir could do, and they don't just stitch together some online services

they send engineers into the organization to embed and learn its processes, then those engineers write the glue to integrate their product with the organization's data -- could be legacy databases, anything you can imagine

when they've finally left the customers end up never leaving, the lock-in rate they have is unreal

btw it's revolutionary because it will  eliminate an entire swath of development work from the tech landscape: in-house development, which is known to be pretty costly and inefficient, is what they prey upon

It's totally random. Fact is, the higher your expectations the less likely they are about to happen. Which means there is a tiny chance but it's totally nuts to play it.
Wow.... this statistic has strayed so far from the actual category it represents. 98% OF OPTIONS   CONTRACTS OPENED EVENTUALLY EXPIRE OTM. What the fuck are you talking about? 

Do you have the IRS records of those categorized as day traders? Pretty sure it requires that you are profitable. I get the whole Autism joke but you’re actually retarded.

Yup, I’m too busy collecting the hefty PLTR premiums.
Extension is neutral. Deals get extended usually for one of two reasons: closing folks are busy, or they need more time for regulatory compliance. Given congress’s vote yesterday, they’re likely building in time to check compliance
Not too upset because I believe PLTR is a solid long term hold, and I got in at 15
She’s hot.. ishh
PLTR up in premarket you know what that means. Prepare for an 8% moon mission in first 30 min then proceed to fall 10% below opening price then fight back to about 4% below opening price then stay flat the rest of the day:)

Bullish
This was the last direct offering. And actually no they’ve raised $200 mill to buy another company.
Corsair is targeted toward a younger demographic who will 100% drop 250-500 dollars to upgrade their rig every 6 months. PC components age fast and if they want to be as good as their favorite streamer, they have to upgrade. Gamers and PC enthusiasts also have the incentive to upgrade regularly because they want to show off their rig to their friends. Corsair also acquired ElGato which is a major player in content creation. Want to start streaming? ElGato has some of the best tools for that. Huge industry with massive room to grow. My 2 cents.
This is not just “someone”. This is u\ControlTheNarrative and put some god damn respect on one of the bravest soldiers in WSB history.

also not the only falsehood in your post:

>Untied states people rent airbnb religously, its more common to rent an AbNB then it is to rent out a room at a skeevy hotel


literally one minute google brought up this:

https://news.airbnb.com/for-the-first-time-since-march-guests-book-1-million-nights-in-one-day/ 

[giving us a maximum of 356 million bookings in a year, as well as the number from their website of 800M+ Airbnb guest arrivals all-time (as of Sept. 30, 2020)


cool.

So ahla says:

> There are more than 1.1 billion guests nights annually in the United States.

so hotels do 28% more bookings in a year than airbnb had guests in forever.
Cool okay so GameStop with 5:1 leverage. Any particular reason?

Again. It is safe as long as you diversify. You are still putting money only in one basket. I'd say do this with 10k/20k, not the whole 100k. There is still a risk that PLTR goes much below 9$. That's why you diversify

My boys let it slip to the dumb bitch about Fridays bonfire. Do I just axe the bonfire all together on what could be a romantic evening? Do I break it to the slut that it’ll never happen between us?

Everyone keeps saying sell off. But we are at ATH or within 1% on all indices. And no one is selling. Deep down we all know this still have a lot more room to run.

It’s a difficult situation. As you said, it’s all about certainty. And there is little certainty when you can suddenly get fired tomorrow but have a family and mortgage. Monetary policy can’t really do much more other than quantitive easing both to firms and the government, and lowering interest rate to 0. Both which they’ve done. Normally, Keynes would say it’s up to fiscal policy to support the economy. During a bad time or demand shocks governments need to take on deficits to stimulate the economy, the problem is, the USA has been in a deficit in good times.

Fuck I completely lost MU out of sight while focusing on these meme stocks and missed the runup
Chug it up your ass or ban
I guess so, the main problem is my position was just too large, after it ran up it was 50% of my portfolio worth at one point. I'm only 4 months into investing so I don't know enough about the market or company valuation to know what is fair value and how newer more volatile companies behave, etc. If it was 10% I probably would have held. Not gonna put that much money in volatile meme stocks for a while untill i'm more confident in what I'm doing.

I learned some lessons though, about setting a trailing stop loss and possibly profit taking a good amount when wsb memes reach their peak lol. And about following citron alerts. And about getting a damn broker that lets me trade pre market because that cost me about 1k yesterday.

I’ve been in this game a long time and many of my colleagues agree on this company. Why are they getting such high price targets from stingy analysts? Do your homework man I’m not trying to argue with you about something so easy to see.

I got out with 80% profit.
Extension, especially to a date close coming such as April is good news, not bad. It means the deal is almost done or else they would have extended longer. Its good to note that just because its extended to April doesn’t mean that’s when they announce that the merger will happen. Could happen a week from now or maybe it will be April. No one knows.
Don’t tease us plebs
The shit talk is warranted but usually there’s not a good reason behind it besides “it just tanked”. Like I said, no negative news on the horizon and we just had a huge correction. I’m open to seeing the other side but no one has given me an actual response in why it could drop today

ELI5: Negative amounts will be shown when the price of the option moves in a bad direction, assuming you were to close your position at that instant. 

Let’s say you sell a covered call for $100 total credit, then the price of the call goes up to $120 total credit. Your account would say -$20. But that doesn’t mean you lost money. If the call expires worthless, you are still up $100. You’re only down -$20 if you buy to close your position (that you sold for $100 and now are buying back at $120). It also means you should have waited longer and would have been able to sell for $120 credit. You missed out on $20 extra.
It is possible for individuals to be up, long term, especially With sports. Just because the house takes a cut doesn’t mean you are inevitably going to lose in the end. If he is playing a skill game then it could be true

You can't think that cruise stocks are already with the vaccine priced in lol CCL trading at 45 before covid, NCLH trading at 55 before covid....
I heard from a friend on thanksgiving that there are a lot of retards here on wsb, but also have you guys heard of pltr?
Thank you
I’m sure the Hanukkah dinners will be fine 😉
Pltr to all time high again
 Clueless
Always take profits and look for re-entry. IMO. If it breaks resistance tomorrow it will retrace to find new support. Once new support is established that will be your entry. Thats my trading style.
lmao cause they’re all in the red
That's not what they think
You better hope it’s legit lol. If they find fraud, like they already did with another company in the sector, NIO will be murdered in broad daylight
> you're mom

I'm all in on SPY calls from the close yesterday - think we pump up to 370 by 10ET and close 373-374
According to /r conspiracy they are alien space tornados
Probably not

#SPY 369
vacc should be catalyst for a decent rally imo however we have been rather sideways in the 48-50 range the past few. Unsure. I usually always buy and roll em if it dips below 50. Then again seeing turd penn/barstool at 71 brings pain.
Not buying Palantir now is like not buying Microsoft in 1999.

It matters if you are buying calls that expire around earnings and not the underlying stock.
is it time to load up on CRM calls yet?
Holding till 610
I work for a defense contractor on the civilian tech side. When we go to trade shows, our business higher ups warn us that if the person asking questions is a Chinese national we keep our answers high level since legally we'll never be allowed to sell our system there anyway

I'm also a cash account on Webull so I day trade it during dips
 on SPY.

Feels similar tbh. I don't pay much theta so there's that
You’re saying a legit stock is going to dump for no reason, but I’m delusional. Wake up man the sell off is over and the bill is literally nothing. I agree some people are stupid and panic sell but it’s over with the stock will be back over 50 next week
Fire
Everyone should own GME imo.
But if it's an option, why would you lose more than the per contract price?
The wind is blowing so hard in San Diego. I think the Coronavirus has evolved.
Preach
I think the pullback on PLTR after that insane rise was to be expected. Obviously the groups that lowered its rating are pulling a citron and trying to devalue it so they can buy the dip.
Wow pre market crew def the worst of all the daily chat crews.
Swap PSTH for GME and you have a point there sir
This guy eventuallys.
I unfortunately don’t know how to do this. :(
Itll hit 40 within 2 years hopefully 😭 im not selling till $100+ baby i got loans to pay off

Apple would definitely try that shit
The face ice masks are a godsend for hangovers. And you can get like 3/$10 on Amazon. Honestly these would make a great stocking stuffer for Becky .. might send some to CNBC HQ

how has that worked for you?

i've read some stuff where people backtested that and even with volatility dropping the puts did not become profitable or only broke even

there are other ways to be short volatility that probably work better than buying VXX puts

but honestly I'd just buy SPY
I figure if I’m just looking for daily gains if I fuck up and the energy company stocks drop that will rise after Covid.  Most will probably double triple after the vaccine is deployed.
PLTR might grow to 100$ per share until 2022. Controversial companies always win. Just sit and watch.
Btw I’m not trapped I know some people are but I got in under 20 so idgaf honestly dude long term this stock wins. 💎 🙌
Yeah I know, but our patience will pay off.
Yes please
Oh I’m not doubting the fact that diversifying your investment in 100 different company’s would yield you better odds of hitting the next Facebook. 

But what if Tesla is going to define a new Facebook price? What if 2021 Tesla sets a new high altogether? Again I’m not investing in just an automotive company or a software company or a renewable energy company. I’m investing in all three. Tesla is a successful automotive company on the cutting edge of renewable design, and Renewable energy is the future. 

You’re entire logic centers around 2020 Facebook setting a proverbial cap for a companies valuation when the potential is there for so much more. Ignoring that potential is the same as ignoring any sort of dd and investing in stocks because the ticker sounds cool.
The Grinch by Dr.Seuss is an allegory about scalpers hoarding all the cool new toys, video games, gadgets etc...

I'm unemployed right now but I gave my cousin in high school some of my older systems because I know how cruel life can be. Fortunately I'm starting a better job in January and once I balance my finances & maybe get some more nice wins on the stock market I'll see if I can get my cousin a PS5 & help a local toys for tots Christmas 2021 even if it isn't tax deductible. Ultimately it is my decision what I do with my earnings & winnings but I'd like to pay it forward and use the power of the free market to make the world a better place.

Chances of AMZN announcing stock split soon? It’s “only” 1.6 trillion market cap. A split announcement would give it an aapl/TSLA like run.
One note: selling naked puts has less risk than naked calls, since naked puts have a fixed amount of loss whereas naked calls have (technically) infinite risk. 

At least that was my understanding of these things.

I’m plenty friendly. It’s just faked interest and enthusiasm 99% of the time.
GME is a pretty long hold though. At least til march. Maybe April. 

We dont know when the squeeze is coming, we're just  hoping earnings will trigger. Or WSB buying will trigger, as it's cheap enough we own 2% now at least.

i've been really split on this recently -- was super worried about inflation and more now since '18  - is inflation the real risk or have we not done enough to save the real economy from deflating?
Have you heard about fucking "Gelsenkirchen" or "Maagdenburg"
Have you seen their software demos? Pretty dope shit tbh
If you only lose the buy in with an option who cares about the loss,  Each contract was $200 or a bit more, I'm learning you don't get obligated to buy the stock at $40, so who cares about the $200x5, that is what you wanted to play with,  am I wrong?  I thought I would get exercised to buy all those contracts.  First trade in Options here.

No rumor no buy. Plenty of shit stocks getting gobbled up by institutions/ make good management moves and never budge (NOVN) needs some juice
No because they don’t give a fuck because they are complying already and don’t fake their numbers. They get audited by the same people that audit Tesla in Shanghai already

Take your profits!!! If you are up even 20% (Which in retrospect is a ton compared to if you bought stock) get out of that shit and wait for your next move. 

Don't say to your self "It'll keep going up or keep going down" Just take your profits and move on to your next one

Also, buy the dip!!!

The bill that gives Chinese companies 3 whole years to cooperate before it takes effect? The bill that NIO spokesperson came out and said they've already known for months and is taking appropriate measures to cooperate with SEC? The bill that focuses on companies with military ties which NIO isn't at all a priority nor interest? The bill that was already priced into NIO these past several weeks? The bill is a non-factor.

‘People are still trying to value companies like Tesla conservatively based on their present value and not the meme power and forward thinking attitude’... bro, this was exactly the mantra in 2000s, saying exactly this about the dotcom companies. You nailed it almost by the word. ‘Ow you can’t value them like before, new era, digital age’... turned out you can. With a 80% correction. History repeats itself.
Is it a shitty choice? Name another company doing what Palantir are doing....
To ignore PLTR or write it off as "overpriced" or something similarly ignorant

is basically being given a second chance by the universe to buy TSLA and saying "no I'll pass" using the same flawed argument as last time

Thanks guys, and fuk you, I need to know more about these Options before I dive in again.  Not on RH though!  They like to cut the power too much!  I thought I would have to buy 500 shares at $40 dollars like a true autist that I am.  5 Contracts x $200 something on each at the time I purchased is about right.  So I could've held on till tomorrow?  Even if it displayed crazy losses.  You live, you learn.  Thanks and blow me a holes.

Go to big companies and give them money to grow faster. If they don't take the money them SB will go fund their competitor.

That's gangsta

So just buy stuff that gaps up AH. GG, you’re so smart, here’s a 💯 on your project
This thread moving so slow that everybody is going to see that I go to furry conventions
Happy I did after buying a few shares at top
Shitting my brains out then going back to sleep
I can do that for most accounts, but one of my accounts is a self-directed IRA and they are not very sophisticated with mobile apps...  so Its just easier to use my laptop.
See ya then!

Meme stocks are great to invest in if you get in early enough and get out in time with tendies. The problem with this sub is people get in way too late or diamond hands themselves into oblivion. People see $1,000 turned into $50,000 and think they should hold past a 100% return like that's a sustainable long term thing.
Well, your definitely in the right sub, that's why i come here, the action.

Imagine being a legacy auto manufacturer and reading Elon high 🔑 make a PSA to merge with the hive or become extinct, but then simultaneously read an internal memo where he's telling his staff to further cut costs because the stonk price is too high.

Elon playing chess in a teseract.

Stonks
MVIS shares, thank me later
this is what happens when a meme stock dips like 40% killing 90% of the subs weeklies
Like buying puts when that company went down 30% in a week? 

Tesla was unprofitable for 17 years, but Elon is a Prophet around here.
Real talk tho I love seeing tsla crm and pltr up but I do be feeling kinda sad when I see other shits up 10% or more pm
TSLA will be between 550 and 615 today
This is the way
This is the peak.
Why are the up charts red and the down charts green?
They have the best pancakes I’ve ever had from a fast food restaurant
Ahhhhh so buy GME because the short squeeze will make us rich?
We get it you bought PLTR at the top
Brilliant replies !!
I like you. Thanks bud.
conversations aren't hard but finding someone worth talking to is
We have a paper trading challenge in college and the system allows you to buy stocks in premarket at yesterdays close price...

I tested neg last night. Puts
THIS\^\^\^ I see TESLA killing it all the way til year-end. Volatile, but killing it regardless. JPMorgan just printed me a ton of tendies, and raised the entry point for S&P funds.
Good luck to us. I think buying $work is good long-term decision
No can do
It’s a problem. I’m so used to tuning in and out of what I want to read/ hear about on the internet it’s created an awkwardness in real life conversations. It’s like being forced to listen to and interact with a YouTube ad.
Drain the coolant.

What’s the actual play today? Continue to flip aapl calls on the dip? Fomo into TSLA (always burns me when I do). PLTR long calls? PUTS??! Help!

OKTA. That shit's going to test 255 today I think and you can prob grab some cheap 255C 0dte at open today depending how hard it gets IV crushed. Prob buy at 6:30 open and sell quick on a gap up candle if there is one around 6:40 for a quick flip. Idk i'm retarded
Which I don't understand, they're a sketchy failing company.
I was just talking with my aunt who's an analyst at Blackrock and telling her I was all in on GME and PLTR. When she asked why I slipped and said "because stocks only go up retard." Thanks degenerates.

People thinking NIO and Xpeng gunna dump lmfao yea the stocks with price targets in the 60s and 70s are gunna dump now that all the paperhands are gone. Best case scenario for the bears is dip at open then moon again like yesterday then it’s all gravy from there
Can’t believe I have to say this but nobody cares that you bought at the top and you’re bagholding trying to justify your shitty choices
nio aint making moeny hate to shrprise you there
Puts on his heterosexuality.
Aren’t most blank check companies?
I propose we pick Rocket Raccoon to lead us all the way
Baba is most likely fine with GAAP reporting, idk if they do it already. It’s a massive, well known company with a history in the market. NIO was a penny stock until China government saved it. A competitor was reported for fraud, doesn’t make the sector look good. We don’t know the effect GAAP would have on NIO. Basically, uncertainty
At this point in time the surgeons scalpel can’t afford to stab you because you’ll die. Can you imagine having high inflation right now whilst in the midst of a pandemic and lockdowns?
Sell uvxy calls. Then you just wait foe crazy theta decay. Doesn’t even have to go down
Seeing a lot of chatter on inflation on Bloomberg. Is it time to jump back into SLV?
On days I have to go in, I have the perfect escape from work to check stonks... We have a VPN set up and sometimes I have to troubleshoot it which requires me to be offsite using a different WiFi.  I just say “it was acting up yesterday” and go to the hotel lobby next door to use their WiFi.

Dear god wtf happened
What fiasco? I made a lot of money.
I am okay since I don't actually buy calls but have some tiny amount of shares in my portfolio.

I press F too pay respect to all those call buying autists who are no longer with us.

I  also pay respect to all those with diamond hands holding shares. 

There will be better times. The gay bears will leave and then we will triumph.

“BIG SHORT GETS SQUEEZED”
Agreed...I wasn’t complaining per say, I was just stating a fact and agreeing with the memelords premise. If one sits and watches CSPAN, reads a newspaper once in a while or listens to select political committees you’ll also hear a dozen of these stories quarterly. 

If you really look closely, you’ll realize our allies do it all well, just not as heavy handed or openly.
Not saying I am smart
Someone was holding in anticipation of the weed news, sold for a decent profit anticipating a dip soon due to everyone realizing the bill will fail. 

I'm still holding all mine tho.

I am pretty sure it’s to federally decriminalize it. States can then decide without federal interference. Even if it  passes it doesn’t seem to change much

Hey goof, it's still under yesterdays high.
I've been there. Usually ends in break, then a few weeks to calm down and reload another 10k.
There was a kid on the discord that had all his student loan, his parent savings and his brothers loan in pltr calls. Think it was around half a million dollars. Idk what happened to him because retard mods banned me for saying I'd suck dick better than everyone else in the server. He also didn't know how options even worked, how to sell them or what exercising them meant.
Slut
Kinda wanna rebuy corsair stocks now, it's a good company with a big upcoming shopping season and  the stock has gotten severly beaten down.
I’ll only say this

>!weed bill has 10% chance of passing and even if it does, it’s for decriminalization, not legalization. So it doesn’t even matter for weed companies but weed tard investors will still pump the stocks!<
hopefully soon. 590 by open im praying
Should have fomo a bit into Palantir yesterday urghsgxhshs
Two weeks away from vaccine and they wanna push hard for one more lockdown? They didn’t capture enough wealth and power already damn!
Just got off the phone with Ivanka, PLTR to $19 today
Dick head.
Someone buy a stick of RAM or something. I need this fucking stock to move up!
Why is BABA up then??
Nah but it will finish the year under $20
>Oh good point. That’s true. Total aside but I also think that America has hit its apex and, as a whole, will slowly begin a gradual decline. The fed will pull out every tool in their tool belt to prevent this for a bit but eventually we will either go to negative interest rates and yield curve control or flat line. I think Michael Burry is also alluding to this. It’s the death of an advancing economic power. But, fortunately, it will be a very slow and gradual decline. Anyway... spy calls 🚀

this is sad but I kind of feel this way as well -- I hope this is not the case but I want to be hedged against it. I just thought that this would happen sooner than later and became a serious gold bug as a hedge (only to lose money contantly). 

ALso if the trend in history is that we're becoming less globalized, does the reserve status matter?
Aint nothin gonna bring this market down, aint nothing gonna hold it down, oh no - its gonna keep on mooning

You can buy shares, that fund the options plays, and pay outs to users are through dividends, dividends would pay like 90% becauseit would be so volatile and no managementcost. All bots. Would that work? I'd drop 130k into it right now if it was real
At this rate, I predict SPY finishes the month at $366.66.
It’s the internet, he is probably 14 years old.
Then the gay cunts shouldn't have sat on it.

By the time my car actually gets warm im already 90% of the way to work. Honda puts.
Am I the only one around here that lost bigly on salesforce dive yesterday? Lost more than 8k on that one.

I sold at 22,5 and obviously I'm regretting it now but it looked like it really would tank to 20 for a while there, still could I guess. But I didn't want my yearly portfolio % to dip into losses lmao. First year of buying stocks, palantir sent me from -1k to +5k then back to 0.
What are you talking about. They are up 15% this month.
OP shitpost
There are much worse things you can do than sell a very unprofitable company when it’s up almost 400% in a month.

Yea when you change jobs and forget about the 401k for a bit that is a good boomer account in mutual funds then reopen it later and realize it was doing just fine without you lol.

Damn straight.
Bought 400 shares of HYLN yesterday. Gonna sell covered calls on this bitch back up to $25
And you can use Tiger Broker if needed.
Ah. Thx for knowledge.

Just hold.
Paypal it to me papa ill put it into gme and give u 2 k back
Thing is it dropped on news of the vote on the weekend. Despite said news also telling us it would be taken to the floor without discussion or amendments. So we already knew exactly the text of the bill.

The only reasonable explanation for not dropping today is a negative result was fully priced in based on the likeliness of the measure passing.

If so I'm a bit of a dumbass for not going in yesterday on NIO and BABA a bit more with my extra change but whatever. Sometimes you miss plays.
Ok I have too much pltr
For winners: the markets open in 3 hours. For degens (95% of WSB), the casino opens in 3 hours.
Yep, seeing Goldman join the target-price leapfrogging gang is just embarrassing. That they need such headline-grabbing guff shows how far their star has fallen
He started at the bottom now he's here (at the top)
Rycey
Ready the weapons soldiers , grab the motorcycles. Pray to your broker, do whatever has to be done. We shall rush into their base and show them how it is done, we shall show that 50% gains are rookie numbers. We shall show them we are ruthless with throwing away our moneys.. WE shall feast on their bones WHILE  we display are massive gains in a matter of minutes, we shall yolo it all on meme stocks, we shall buy every gamestop stock and own it fully, we shall throw money on NIO and PLTR.. TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

AUTISTS STRONG TOGETHER
This autistic (me) would gladly take that 1k and reinvest into some PLTR calls.
lay it on me and I'll see if I like it. 69% sure I already know it when I see it

Ipoh mali, added some calls now. God speed.
Got a TESLA call at the very bottom yesterday and I know it’s gonna be beautiful at open. I really want to hold but I’m scared
In norway leverage is called "giring" which directly translates to gearing
PLTR will never be under $9 again
Ban
I'm boarded
Thanks senpai
How much did he say he had left?
Just post it with spaces or make it part of another word... like egGNOG.
Smart guy located
Don't think there will be much of a dip at open today.  Too much momentum off of the GS upgrade.  We may get a dip *later* in the day, but at a much higher price point.
How could they be more fucked. They got a printer up their ass
Apperantly paper handed pussies have to be reminded daily or they'll sell and start crying in the thread.
Making what now?!

Suspect slow going yeah, it's almost as if it should go down but we just ran out of sellers. Everyone in the stock now wants to hold onto it but we don't have rocket ship momentum.

Sell off to start or buy premarket ?

Yes. Long term. IPO holders will expiry in March.  Then may drop and increase exponentially again. We have a long run. December. January. February. IPO holders want more. They couldn’t sell all shares at the spike last week. Needs to wait their expiration in March. The red balance hurts. Stop looking at. Hold.
That was really 1 day no?

Good morning to everyone except bears. Fuck you bears
Don’t even get me started on the weed bill
Roll TSLA 12/4 to 12/18c at open or will there be a dip? I want to sell at open and wait for one but I'm fucking retarded and don't know what I'm doing

Way cheaper
kinda wanna see some non-govt contracts now
shhhhhhhhhhhhhhh nobody knows yet
Honestly no clue. Really into this lingo though.
It was up premarket yesterday too and dumped at open. Hopefully it doesn’t do the same.
Yes, and I don’t think it passes the senate but it’ll make it through the house
Not all $3.50?
no $TSLA is not a value stock, i thought you wanted value stocks.

i am done with value stocks.

Aye morning.  French press and eggs.
You dont think it drops further if/when mango signs?  Even if that doesnt result in anything real action, I think it still would dip further.
Hilarious how I'll only get fucked by my puts if SPY gains 10% before dropping once 1% from its current levels. And I'm still worried

Can't believe I have to say this, this is a hold long term for several reasons:

1. PLTR is helping with the Colombian Government on their Covid-19 response.

2. PLTR will be assisting the UK Government with Brexit and border control in 2021.

3. The UK Government will begin mass vaccination roll out next week to it's population of 70 million people, who is assisting? PLTR

4. The US Government have operation warpspeed coming to fruition, whose involved heavily, PLTR.

Long term hold, averaging my position down daily

"Yeah, PLTR, that one is headed straight to a $40 price target. It's got solid...ummm....fundamentals: COGS is like 2% of goodwill impairment net of treasury stock-bundled exotic annuity disbursements and when you amortize Thiel's karma over the lifetime of Project Sauron, we're all fucked in the long run, so $40 is an easy month-end target and STRONK BUY from me.

I want to start my "workday" already. Open the markets and get it over with
Sell off to start or buy in at premarket ?
Nothing has changed for BABA though. They already agreed to be compliant with the audit, they were undervalued after the ANT ipo stuff, they were just chilling for a few days. Only thing I can think is maybe people were worried there would be some more serious verbiage in the bill or something?

Can someone with an actual economic background explain to me what he means exactly by economic renters vs economic owners? I would have thought that the relationship was the other way around - that printing $, + Stocks, consumer inflation meh, will make those who profit from rent make more money since growth is greater than real economic gains

I took a loss on that and went into GME. Bagholders will get their money back eventually, but it doesn’t offer the same potential explosion. And it could still fall further. Yolo GME.
 😢
This whole week has been about getting rid of paper hands, not many left I think.
Wtf does that mean? CRSR go down?
it could drop down from paper hands, shit went up $10 in one trading day. its gonna dump a lil.
Nobody knows what this company does other than being a large money-laundering operation.  How the fuck do you think it's going to blow up when you do not even know what it does, you fucking moron?
Because boomers idk? Normal fluctuation to me, it might dip a bit in the beginning but it’s getting bought back up immediately
Mods should create a wiki to collect these bible pages
GS needs to improve their year-end results. Go buy some Tesla call options. Lmao
Is it normal to have dreams about the market and about the rh screen?
Working until 2hours after market open should I set my options to sell at market price at open? Or risk it and hope they keep going down until I’m off work
Do it
Futures flatter than a plate of piss.
Fuck what happened to it
If you believe in NIO long term, yes
Thinking of throwing my life savings into TESLA today thoughts ?
Will drop more
Glad I live in Florida
Is minimum price of an option actually last price of an option or the bid price at the time? 

Option may be traded days before and the price is stuck there but the actual bid at the time of the trade is much higher hence it would be impossible to trade it.

So why is it down AH? If it was price in there should be a less than 1% change
Imagine being a soyboy that scalped enough PS5s to commemorate each time he watched his wife and her boyfriend have sex, & is using the proceeds to provide alimony and child support for his soon to be ex-wifes son and if there is anything left over he MIGHT get a beaten down PS2 for his cuck shed.

Yes let’s tie up our money for a whole year on a 40% otm put. Great idea good sir!
It’s so comfy I’m my big bed with my phone in one hand and my wiener in the other and I have CRM calls. Life is good!
Your problem is not that you missed your chance to pull out, but that you started gambling in the first place. stop deluding yourself. you're just pulling the one armed bandit and getting confused by all the lights and noises while getting sucked dry.
Chinese companies just profit of that progress, they play no part in making it happen. 
If the progress should be shared then the cost of progress should be shared as well, otherwise it's just parasitic.
Reminder that any day that GME doesn't go down is a good day. 1 more day of interest accumulated.
PLTR 30 EOY. Andrew Left, you done fucked up!

PLTR reminds me so much of RKT around the same high, dump super fast to 20

thats the spirit
I can’t believe I even have to say this but you guys have peanut brains and WSB like kindergarten for traders

PLTR is up almost 4% AH, there is no bad news on the horizon. It fell because it was overbought and MS downgraded it. No reason for it to fall more now 

NIO is down more than 2.5% AH. The anti China bill is being sent to daddy and this will no doubt have an affect on NIOs price in the short term. NIO won’t get delisted because they’ll switch to GAAP reporting but their financial results won’t be as hot. NIO is red today.
Okay

So on point of clarity. PLTR is not a "data mining company". They themselves don't operate infrastructure to collect, store and analyse data themselves. They simply write and deploy solutions for customers to do this.

This is such a pervasive misconception for some reason that I don't understand. Somehow PLTR tards think it's Rehoboam when it's more like Splunk with a nicer frontend.

Also it's worth mentioning that my title at $DAY_JOB is "Tech Lead - Data Infrastructure & Data Engineering" for a fairly sizable US startup that -does- collect a lot of data.
These are the same people who buy calls when it’s jumped 200% in a week

Yeah, the big problem with helicopter money is its short time nature.

First, it signals to everyone that things are NOT ok, which makes people save that money instead of spending.  If you're gonna give a fiscal stimulus, you either guarantee to people that they can feel safe, the money isn't going anywhere/

Or you do it like FDR and just give people jobs.  Then they all think they deserve the money and start spending it.

CA issues *stay at home* order and the world will crash.
- Being short is not „for free“ you have to pay premiums and you have to provide necessary margins
- If stock rises you have to provide more margin
- if you run out of margin you have to cover AND if your risk exposure becomes to high someone might force you to cover
- if one big player starts covering a reduced float could (!) lead to a squeeze
- a squeeze means a spike in price as everybody is desperately trying to buy in order to cover as their margins are overextended and/or book losses are too high - combine this with the reduced float and this is the formula for disaster

Historical example: Volkswagen squeeze

Overheard in the deleted scenes after The Big Short:
“He got me,” Burry said of Elon. "That f***ing Musk boomed me."
Burry added, “He’s so good,” repeating it four times.
Burry then said he wanted to add Tesla to the list of stocks he shorts this year
I’m 24 and can’t imagine being married, let alone having a kid. That’s some 30s shit

Edit: not to mention, divorce rates would probably lower because you’re not getting married in your 20s when you’re still developing as a person. 30s you are pretty much going steady. 20s is a rollercoaster for many people

Seriously, again, I am a huge PLTR bull, but this rally was unsustainable and we are not going back to 30 before earnings at the earliest (and that would require a huge overperformance)
So do I sell my PLTR calls at open for an 80% loss instead of a 90% loss?
Don't read this reply either
Next year I can see it easily breaking $100 maybe even 200 but you have to know that this can be taken from you at any moment

Take 1k and do it again next month so you arent risking all your gains. When you have 20k, use 2k for options. Etc. 

And buy GME shares. PSTH and possibly PLTR too, apparently.
To be fair, the Chinese has already been operating the civilian version of the Blackhawk so the US kinda only had itself to blame for that one.

To be frank: you just agree because you are lacking the basic concepts of what a short sell - and the subsequent covering - is.

I am not saying that an epic squeeze will happen - I just want to point out that you are agreeing to confirm your own uneducated opinion.

Having said that: it is obviously a risk/return gamble. How could you possibly expect returns of > 100% without associated risk?

Short: you lack basic education and are basically your own echo chamber
Selling puts = bullish

Buying puts = bearish

>I don’t agree that inflation will help with income equality. In the short term, it wreaks havoc on the middle class because wages are always slow to adjust. In fact, steep inflation has the opposite effect - it causes a larger wealth gap.

The main property a middle class family has is their house. Mortgage are advantageous on a inflationary situation, provided that the economical growth is also happening (wages are also being inflated).
What’s a good one?
Well technically, since there is no moon base..... then yeah.....
is a bit much of a run up for my taste, but surely now the jump will be immense!
Loaded up on calls. They were so fucking cheap how could I not
What about xpeng
I see all the warnings and have a morbid curiosity to click just to see how bad could it possibly be.
Well this comment is all the DD I need to yolo my  life savings: TSLA $800C 12/31

Hey look, it’s the only freedom you got left!
i will sell everything as soon as the hypetrain has started, anything between $20-30 and  my gutfeeling. then i will buy the dip again between the coming bleedout and sell it again, when the mergerhype kicks in next year. so far the warplan.
Bullish.

They just their companies off our exchanges. The companies still trade on their markets, export goods, make trade deals. But no US intervention into a state owned asset. I dunno man, I’m out. It was fun, onto GME.
It's going to be holding huge govt accounts and sucking up tax payer dollars. For those with near date options you're fucked, shareholders you're fine. 

This is a big brother company and its all the rage rn.

I bought stock on Friday, I’ve decided to just create a blind spot in my mind for pltr and check back in 2 years and hope that I’ve atleast gone in the black.
Dude they aren’t having a dip today, it’s a dump. They’re still red AH

Yeah FDX has had such a good run-up, I made a bunch of money a few months ago just buying and selling vertical spreads whenever it dipped. The call side was my only real concern but you're probably right. I just don't like that selling the put uses about the same buying power as making it a strangle instead

Why do people really think NIO and Xpeng are going to have another dip lol y’all are so greedy you missed it already
buddy, we're clinging to anything that confirms our bias. could you maybe no stop the circlejerk?
I spend years to educate myself about the stock market, I have years of experience, and I remember one time a true legend named Warren Buffet told me:

  "Buy the dip F*ggot"
Well ok, yes. The FED takes securities from banks, and gives them money.   


Only issue is, money isn't the only thing that works like money. When the FED assaults the repo market with the excuse of "providing liquidity"  its s actually removing liquidity cause the banks don't need the cash, they need securities to be able to lend more money.   


End result is  security prices inflation.

I had sold to open a put that needed $10K collateral, which I had. I couldn’t buy it without the collateral. I then bought a bunch of SPAC shares and the cash balance in my account went down to around $3K, well below the collateral I supposedly needed for the still open Puts. Is RH just retarded for letting me do that, or was the collateral covered by margin at that point?
yeah....my  portfolio is going to need ackman to announce his spac merger asap. Portfolio has taken a gutshot and slow bleedin' all week
I can relate to the imma high part.
In dec 2018 CRSR had a debt/equity of 260%. In sept 2020 the debt/equity has heavily declined down to 95.2% still a big number, but for the first time CRSR actually had a positive inflow of money. 

 CRSR's debt is well covered by operating cash flow (36.8%). 

 Interest Coverage: CRSR's interest payments on its debt are well covered by EBIT (3.1x coverage). 

Todays valuation around 34 is a fair valuation with the numbers we know today, the thing is I believe CRSR have and will continue to grow in a crazy pace considering the boost Covid-19 has brought and the fact that PC, streaming and everything around that will just continue to grow. 

But the most positive part is that CRSR is making more money than they are spending.
If short term investors sell the news to cash out some of their profits after today's event I would strongly suggest going long (if conference goes well obviously).

I was confused after beating earnings by 175% why CRM had another huge sell off (larger than the first one after the WORK acquisition)

Now I know this isn't uncommon, but they've had a few large volume days now of sell offs in comparison to their average volume, is more to be expected?

A lot of electronics products have fast markets and custom orders so IP theft is unprofitable to pursue in a lot of cases. For example a particular circuit or electronics module that goes into your oven or some industrial machinery doesn't have a huge market, it may be made for only a few customers or even just one. instead of litigation, the players are efficient in copying each other... So one of my first assignments was reverse engineering a Tridonic module that our sales rep promised to a client we were making it cheaper than them... (They lied we didn't even make them, but we did in about two weeks time). After that order has shipped internationally its unlikely there would be many other customers for it so Tridonic likely never found out about it.
Other times we (Panasonic-VS) would check out our competitors and find our IP on their board. It would get noted etc but I was told by higherups they would only act on it if it started being a cashcow. 
Phillips was the biggest player in our niche and absolutely everyone was copying them... But I doubt they cared too much as their market and profit share dwarfed ours.
I’m printing this out and framing it above my monitor to keep myself in check.
What are you even trying to say other than what OP just said?
That’s rough cause white people hate each other, causing world wars and sht. Plus y’all getting bullied by minorities in your own countries lol. 

Asians also really hate each other, but they are mostly pretty damn racist so I guess they have more tolerance for each other. They love fighting each other though.

Africans and middle eastern people struggling. Slavs are drunk. Only one race left to redefine humanity: Furries.
I cannot wait to lose my cash!
I think FDX can hit 305~ before 12/17 then you’ll end up paying $745 to buy back the call alone. I think you should just sell the put and let it expire, all package delivery companies have been killing it revenue wise and as long as FDX gives good guidance it should moon but there’s always the chance they don’t give guidance and it drops like a brick like ups
China owns half the world. That’s a national security law. They haven’t opened up about Covid. They locked down Hong Kong. China don’t fuck around, the state is GOD.
imagine destroying your economy, created millions of lung damaged dependas with 200K dead, and your currency is worth less than toilet paper but your stonks are ATH
What's the point of this? Stocks that move a lot means big gains for options, you're just gonna make people think if they buy lottos on any ticker they'll get rich. Most of the move happens pre-market.

quality post as always. cheers bud!

question: with pltr in premarket at around 23.40, would you consider this as broken the resistance? volume is high for premarket....

of course we will have to see what happens after open, just curious on your TA
Holy shit, that’s essentially my take as well, but you have actual examples. I actually used Looker a lot and recommended it to a tard here who went all in on PLTR because he “works” with data, and joining tables together is apparently too hard for him lol, so he is convinced PLTR has some killer product that that just drag and drop, and it gives him not only the data he needs but also analysis, because “ai and shit”. I told him how hard it is to scale their product so it’s generic enough for any company to integrate easily, but he was not convinced. I actually know a FDE, sounds like a horrid job tbh, especially given how hard their interview is, and the things they actually end up doing. 

Maybe PLTR has some niche markets they can explore, but don’t they get their data mostly from FB, Google anyways? These companies spend more on research and dev more than PLTR’s entire revenue, so I honestly don’t see how they have the magic formula/tool. Thanks for the write up!
At least you have pubes...
I don't think there is much the United States can do directly.  China's biggest weakness remains its government, and how much acceptance it has among the general population.  Currently it is high despite the intensive authoritarianism, primarily because it has lifted hundreds of millions out of abject poverty.  But that's not a sustainable path, especially as the children of those uplifted generation(s) grow up.  They won't look back to their peasant farmer ancestors from the 1960s and think: wow we're so ahead, they look to the US, Europe, and elsewhere and ask: why are we so behind?

Maybe nationalism and continued economic growth will keep that bubbling issue buried.  Perhaps not.  Russia couldn't manage the same issue, even after 80 years of indoctrination.

It’s also timing. Some western universities are same level as Chinese universities but the western ones have can get you undergrad.

My guy, this literally is a full out casino. 80% of DD here is BS and nobody really knows what’s gonna happen.
She ain’t fat bruhhh she just a little thccccc
TLDR basically a consulting company, also their software is behind the times compared to cutting edge stuff from GOOG/FB/MSFT in the same fields.

They masquerade as a software company but really they are basically just a consultancy that happens to have some reusable software they sell on the side.

Their financials are stupidly misleading. Sales and marketing account for like 1/3rd their expenses (R&D and administration making up the rest), HOWEVER they have neither sales people (well they are getting some, currently accounts for 3% of head count) and 0 marketing folk.

So you might ask the question, where is all that fucking money going? Well, that is how they pay the consultants. Usually referred to as Forward Deployed Engineers (FDEs) they are accounted for under sales and marketing despite being compensated like SV engineers and not being counted in COGS (this is why their gross margin of 80% is also stupidly misleading).

Even if you put all of this aside and assume they have some killer product I have some bad news for you. First of all it's not some magic box you just drop in and it just "works out where your data is". That is what the consultants primarily do, write custom integrations for all the bullshit DB2 systems and crap that needs to be ingested.
Then if you assume hey, you need to do that for all competitors too, yes that is true except you can hire -anyone- to do that, you aren't beholden to your vendor + integrator in one (PLTR).

Additionally their competitors just have vastly superior products. GOOG in particular is -FAR- in the lead of everyone, by a literal fucking mile. BigQuery alone dumpsters all things like it (not to mention all things like it are actually copies of it based on the Google Dremel paper). That is without factoring Dataflow, AI Platform, etc. You could argue Data Studio is shit but GOOG doesn't lock you into that, you can go get Looker which is best in class and connect that to BigQuery.

They are a government contractor. If you wouldn't invest in a baby Raytheon or Lockheed then don't invest in PLTR.

Caveats: They could in theory change their product and business model into a more growth friendly package. Eliminate the need for their consultants, preferably make a cloud hosted option of their DB + frontend available, switch to a more traditional sales model that works outside of government etc.

However i am not banking on them doing any of that because if they could have they would have done it 10 years ago.

I don’t see Corsair’s long term ability to capitalize on sales of product correlating with the current growth. What does Corsair sell? Peripherals. If they really lean into selling their pre-builds, maybe. Even then, consoles are going to get some market share back as Covid dials down and TV sports come back. 
Again, I am not saying Corsair will die. I think it’s worthy of a slow and steady growth. My rig is in a Corsair carbide air case. I’ve had it for 5 years and it’s fine. On my list of priority purchases, replacing it is low. Very very low.
Not everything is moon or tank. Corsair looks solid as an investment. It’s in my 401k and doing well enough. However, Im pretty sure it’s going to keep getting pummeled by profit takers until it corrects to a reasonable level. Then it’s a slow move, unless they announce something that every gamer has to have. I have never seen a Corsair product that convinced me to drop the equivalent I had and buy. 
They’ll be relevant, I just think this price valuation has room to fall. If it drops sub 30, I’ll start getting LEAPS.

Are there any meaningful catalysts left for broad market movements before inevitable stimulus news? Seems like we will trade sideways / down a little until we enter the new year?
Those pussies always allocate to the most basic, bitch handed retirement funds with a bunch of bonds and boomer shit for holdings.  I always load mine into the most high risk, large cap fund available (unless I can choose actual companies) and get better returns than any of my coworkers.

You have the wrong chart for PLTR

Edit : OP fixed it
Dammit. Thanks. Will change. You da best friend.
You posted your TMO analysis 7 months ago ill trust you with anything lol
because it’s not on robinhood
Pretty much any contractor working on anything sensitive would require clearance though.
Well it’s going to be worth at least double by this time next year. If another analytics company, that just reported a shitty ER yesterday, can trade at over $280/ share then PLTR should be able to clear $40-50 easy.
I guess we’ll see ;)

I’ll check in with you in a month

Ask me next month, I'm buying the dip.
You should have bought few put options to soften your loss
from daddy bot that had $1,200,000 then lost $400,000 in options in 1 week, but was ok cos he bought commercial real estate for $200,000, which is safe, and gave the remaining $600,000 to bot bot to lose $200,000 in one week leaving $400,000 which is fine because then bot bot can play it safe with the $400,000.
If you have cc debt and you're buying options you're the dumbest person I know. Credit cards have a guaranteed 5-30% interest rate working against you no matter what. If you're gonna "invest" in anything, invest in not having bullshit interest payments on a credit card. Imagine having a stock with *guaranteed* increase in value, you would buy as much as possible. Now imagine the opposite and that's credit cards and I guess debt in general.
Pltr 🚀🚀🚀
You're too eager for this bet.
Very different. AMD could not possibly go totally tits up because of licences, ip, possible Intel monopoly etc. No one would care if GME ceased to exist now.
We're already 4% there
Sir this is a tendies, by calls or leave and go hang with the bears in the dumpster out back selling handies. Tendies or Handies these are your two options sir. Back of the line please
25% of the Moon = 🚀🚀🚀
Who says I’m not doing the same lol
First of all, it's not a new company where you expect more from future than present. Secondly, those "serious analyst" rated Pltr twice as much in 2018 (when they were hoping that Pltr will take an IPO route than direct listing) with less than half of current  revenues. Analyst are just pawns doing the dirty work of big players.
It would be stupid to have your money tied up for one year for measly 23% return when we are going through IPO boom.
Don't take my words for it, go and look up some cnbc clips about Pltr from 2018, and compare them to now

Keep your head up king. Seems like you’re evolving into a greater you.
Genuinely asking though as you seem informed on the topic, how does the us handle the current situation regarding China? Imo, if we just continue doing what we are currently, it is inevitable that China eventually takes over as the global hegemony that currently belongs to the US. Obviously, the US won’t just let that happen and I’d argue that it isn’t necessarily terrible if China does take our place as they will inevitably fail eventually due to population and other related practical reasons imo, but how should the US handle the situation?
So, how are you doing?

It's not a game, man, we're all human beings. 

Not trying to defend oppressive governments that rely on IP theft for important things instead of building a less shitty environment for it to be created in-house, but at the same time... Humans making progress and then trying to restrict other humans from utilizing the knowledge too is just childish and shitty. 

One could make an interesting argument about trying to restrict the technological ability of countries who treat people and the environment poorly both nationally and internationally... But that becomes a double-edged sword pretty quickly, unfortunately.

Gosh, dropping all this intellectual theft without military effort would be real difficult. It would take the cooperation of pretty much every country on the west side of the Pacific and the US. Some sort..
 Transpacific partnership. This is really complicated, so it would probably have to be some unilateral diplomatic and legal agreement. If only we had a president who could produce something like that instead of a trade war.... But who...?

Edit: For people believing the TPP was pro-China... China wasn't in the TPP. It was all the countries surrounding it. Pretty fucking hard to be pro-China.
Negative, the dollar is definitely depreciating like your mothers cooch after a friday night bingo tourney
Those are rookie numbers in your racket, you gotta pump those numbers up.
China is literally using slave labor to make things cheaper, which in turns fucks over the west. We should boycott China as much as possible if you really care about humans and your own country. Build stronger trade with Canada and the EU and Japan. Fuck China.
Fair enough. Gotta be careful anytime I make jokes not at the orange I come back to like -10 and 14 comments.
also your math is retarded as shit. if you sold 25 puts and the stock drops to 14 you actually made no money. On top of that your cash is locked in for a whole year and who knows what can happen.
Try selling options instead of buying them  🤔

Gambling is not investing, and if you are paying any attention at all to the gain/loss porn on here, it is ALL gambling.  And of course you can pay someone to invest for you... That's the whole point of ETFs and mutual funds.  You just will never see thousands of percent return with them (because, once again, that only comes from gambling).

Also, it helps to remember that all the thousands of dollars in gains being posted here came from poor retail schlubs being fleeced.  If you aren't the one doing the fleecing, bro, you're the mark.

The point of the trade is believibg that the company is worth that much ... So investing in it ... Nobody said it can't go lower. And of course you have to diversify.
Their demographic age-shift is definitely an issue for em but they're also very big on automation. Companies everywhere are but it's definitely noticeable in a country so big on manufacturing.

Also the government subsidies mentioned seem to be better targeted at emerging or strategic markets compared to the billions spent in the west on  subsidising the likes of agriculture and fossil fuel industries.        
China's labour is getting more expensive and it needs to diversify its resources intake? Chinese gov starts investing in Africa and shortly after it's private companies overtake it there.     
China sees smog as a growing issue during it's rapid urbanisation as well as climate change for the future whilst also seeing a big emerging market. China starts producing solarpanels en masse.    
Same with it's internal market home appliances demand, it's electric vehicles, etc     

It might be a patronage system of governance that one would think would've gone south long ago but it acts surprisingly smart and coherent in the grand scheme of things.

The reason like <20% of most major universities are Chinese international is because their government hopes they can use and steal our knowledge to benefit themselves. The Chinese international culture at my campus is so odd. They participate not at all in campus life and groups. They stay in their cliques and rarely interact with the general student body unless it is required(projects, study groups, ect). My roommate has been dating a Chinese girl for almost 2 years now and it’s crazy how much she doesn’t know(disillusioned?) about her country and their dealings. She was 23 when she learned about Tiananmen Square. It’s scary how much control the CCP has over its citizens.

I was predicting 12/9 to be the day the record’s broken, this stuffs happening too fast
It takes 3 years once investigated for the SEC to delist a Chinese company. If ya’ll think Tesla coming out with a 25k car in 2 years is too long then I wouldn’t sweat any major Chinese companies (BABA or NIO) getting delisted. Any weakness here is a buying opportunity.
I understand. I am all in.
Tried that with Tesla. Didn't work. It mooned many times. Then bought. Then tanked. Now I bought again. Now I just don't know anymore.
Am both fearful and greedy. What do?

Wow God dammit i held a BlackBerry call $7 strike after reading some DD. Bought it for $6 and was talking to my friend about buying 100 because fuck it why not. He talked me out of it and I sold my one option at market close for $3. 

I had no idea until right now that it reached $9.25 bro I could have fucking mooned I was staring at my screen. If I pushed a couple buttons I would have turned $600 into $30,000 Jesus christ somehow this hurts worse than losing money im nit even gonna sleep tonight 

Guess where I sold

Check out all that traffic around China.  We're talking about hundreds to thousands of ships, spread over thousands of kilometers of water.  How is the US Navy supposed to check each of these ships while staying out of China's missile envelope?  Remember, its large enough the carrier fleets would need to stay several hundred kilometers E/SE of Japan, at the very least.  

How do you deal with ships changing nationalities?  They can do so easily as long as neutral nations allow it, and they always will because they're not signing up for an economic meltdown too.  So now you need a worldwide blockade.

And there is the simple matter of *finding* ships.  Without transponders it requires dedicated orbital searches, or extensive aircraft flights.

And aaaaaall of this is absurd because during all this the Chinese would be using their attack subs to fuck around, putting AA and antiship missiles on cargo ships to bait out carriers, and sticking them on islands further out to surprise adversaries.
Then who did?
First thoughts lol
Do you beg him to put on a magnum XL you bought for him while you watch crying in the corner?
I mean there is a reason why American military secrets keep getting stolen by Russia or China. The NSA is fighting a defensive battle and they're losing. Shit gets stolen all the time from intrusions and the NSA couldn't patch holes fast enough let alone go on the offensive (even though there are in actuality 2 departments that deal with offense/ defence)
Everyone knows the deaths are inflated because the hospitals are making money for them. Most people aren’t even paying attention anymore.

I agree but they are equivalent to 1920s america in many ways and are going to have to adapt. I don’t think they can do so in a productive way without making sacrifices but in paper they should be at the top
AUST for buy ETF, RTRD for short position.
I’m more worried about Xi’s retaliation than anything. Hmmmm what American companies have doubled down on Chinese demand and production that could be easily targeted politically....hmmm...

And you're not autistic, just a dick. Can't even call someone a real asshole because you want to use symbols..
Cool. That’s your perspective. They’re like assholes.
In a long drawn out war where america is forced to invade China, it'll never work out. They have more soldiers and volunteers. Coupled with the fact that anti ship missiles are actually a major threat and could come from any direction in swarms. Sinking a carrier group will probably be as easy as shelling a trench during wwi.

In actuality, the US will probably bomb Chinese infrastructure to the ground. But this won't happen because Russia and China won't back down to this bs. The US has only been facing asymmetrical warfare ever since the 2nd gulf war so don't be too sure about their dominance in a straight out slug fest among actual military powers like China or Russia.

Moonshot Slot Machine: 12/11 CRON 10c or 11c. Senate might surprise us and move the bill a bit or kick it back with some riders on it. Altria been feeding McConnell money lately, and they want that market share before the states have a stronger foothold to prevent getting ratfucked by big tobacco. Plus, it’s a stupid show of “partisanship” that they can spin as a money thing right now to appease the base, then flip the narrative and say “yeah, well, we passed that and the dems are still saying we’re obstructionists.”

Forrest Gump: as many GME shares as you can stomach. Weird shit is happening with their website, and unless guidance is literally “we did better than expected and are keeping the business model,” it’s a catalyst for buying. Earnings call sucks? Cohen calls the meeting on leadership.

(Reverse psychology 😉)
What's more is that the US was once known for this.      
The rise of the US at the turn of the 19th century was essentially a process of rampant IP theft from the UK, notably textile manufacturing tech. The British at the time played this game plenty with the French as well, etc with modern IP protection across the globe being a  n historically recent thing that kinda favours established powers and is also notably broken.      
(See companies like AMD and Intel strategically and timely extending their technology with new patents that become the standard essentially protecting their duopoly into perpetuity.)

There's also a lot of cases of such copies being ordered by Western companies (usually not high tech stuff) with the idea that they can just say they didn't know it was copyrighted and just took it as an offering from a Chinese company. (I remember one such case reaching the frontpage on reddit when it was an American supermarket chain doing it against some inventor that made a tool who then made a video about it.) and then there's amazon notably known for copying plenty that sell using their store and has good margins.

Ah i thought his was cash covered, misread that part. 

So what I meant was, if it was cash covered then in case your acc doesnt have the collateral can’t the broker take it from your other investments? 

Ex: Selling cash covered put for $15 strike on pltr and it actually reaches that, but you have no buying power. However you have 10k on Apple stocks. Would they just take it from that, or just have the acc at negative buy power.

airbnb is garbage. their business model is too easy too copy, just like uber. these type of companies have no potential to dominate their segment, which is how you make money: you go into the market and dominate. airbnb cant do that. they might be doing surprisingly well due to all hotels being closed, but so are all the competitors of alternative bookings.

i live in london. they are considering changing the law on airbnb landlords and tax them equal to hotels. that would over night put them out of business over here, the most visited city in the western hemisphere.

In text released ahead of a lengthy interview to be broadcast on Sunday, ARD TV quoted **Snowden saying the NSA does not limit its espionage to issues of national security and he cited German engineering firm, Siemens as one target.**

**“If there’s information at Siemens that’s beneficial to U.S. national interests - even if it doesn’t have anything to do with national security - then they’ll take that information nevertheless,”** Snowden said, according to ARD, which recorded the interview in Russia where he has claimed asylum.

Look at a lot of IPOs most of them kinda tank in then beginning then rally like crazy.
They think it is literally impossible to make money where any real risk is involved. It's risk/reward ratio not lose/lose like their sex life, and normal life are.
Yes of course ... But as for any other investment, your money is locked up ... The difference here is that it is locked up as collateral and not as shares
what does 11/18 mean?

Spacex wouldn’t really do great as a public company. They don’t have a model of increasing profits quarter on quarter and most their income is just government contracts maybe starlink will provide that but I don’t think Elon wants it. They are so much more agile the way they are. An interesting idea might be to have public voyages like how the Dutch raised money for trips to India back in the day.
Yup, fuck rh
Whatever strike is just outside the money. That way it moves ITM relatively soon most of the time, typically a delta of 0.5. I’ll sell contracts with a delta of 0.2 so it doesn’t get too close to ITM, 0.3 if it’s a green day since odds are it won’t keep gapping up.
Yes, I will not lie, I have spoken ill of the app in the past but I always come crawling back after Robinhood fills my calls 70% down
Why not? That’s only 1.6% an hour.

Oh fuck don’t do this to me 😅
So wel'll just buy more shares? Sounds great !
It's pretty obvious they put a hit on us two days ago when every meme stock tanked, including the ones you haven't heard about. Yet the dow and s&p were basically up all day. I blame pltr and gme especially. They made shit tons of money off us, our calls were an easy target. "They" will always have more money then us. The question is, where do we go from here? The meme stocks are getting dangerous to play with these fuckers on our backs.

TD Ameritrade is so cracked. Interface is amazing, they fill my orders below my limit price. God I just wanna cuddle up next to my little AI broker.
And btw "investing" usually means locking up your money
would it be retarded to buy back into PLTR or is it gonna die before it goes back up again
Are you actually retarded or delusional? He didn’t buy those shares, he’s ready to dump them

After the inclusion and triple witch ? 12/18
What’chall think about ev’s tmr and next week?
It's easy.Write down all the stock tickers in small individual pieces of paper. Put them all in a jar. Everyday shake the jar vigorously and close your eyes and pick a paper from the jar, that is your stock of the day,
This is bullshit, but I believe it.

Picked up another 100 shares for market open.

We're all fucked now.
And if the stocks goes to 12$ because it's overvalued, you lost it all and some.
ORLY?
*owlface*

How much profits to take
*concernedlook*
if its stocks, why not. yolo it. after 10 years 22$ or 24$ won't matter if PLTR will go to 200 lel.
pltr to $30 today
Yeah until US-Market opens and the sell-off begins. Repeat

DUDE the title is misleading. People here are either idiots or just ignoring the pump and dumps.

He did NOT BUY any shares, he is CONVERTING his shares so HE CAN SELL THEM.

Jesus, I know WSB can be retard sometimes but reddit as a whole is a dumpster fire

It'a one thing to say (bad, uninformed) opinions, but to literally say untruths is too much. And people like yoi belive this and gave awards.

HE POSTED THE FREAKING LINK TO AN OFFICIAL FILING. Jesus you guys fell for the 5000th pump and dump this year.

At least download or torrent if you are cheap some Sykes dvds from 2008 so learn the basics Jesus.
The less you know the better. Ride the wave.
no one tell him
Yeah or I could buy shares and sell slightly OTM covered call weeklies and not lock up my money for a fucking year.

Buy 100 shares at 22.50

Sell a Dec 11 25c for $1.17

Go similarly OTM each week, three times, congrats you collected more premium than with your CSP, and it took a month instead of a year.
Unfortunately I only heard of it @ $18 (I was off WSB sick for >2 months... IKR).. then missed out massively (my shitty broker had issues making funds accessible), and it was $25 by the time I got in. Thinking I would have loved to get in then so $21 seems like an ok compromise....
yeah i’m gonna need NIO to reverse a bit of that 25% gain from yesterday please
NIO Inc is not the same as NIO China. We are invested in NIO Inc a holding company that owns nothing but 76% of NIO China. NIO China is 24% STATE OWNED and they have the assets, they make the cars, they have the staff, they have the funding.

If anyone thinks NIO won’t be affected by this bill they are delusional. Memes may push the price higher but you are only feeding the institutions that will back out every time it hits a bullrun. 

There is no way in hell China will allow any of its state owned or part state owned operations be audited by an American company. 

The only thing we can hope for is that the US allows NIO Inc only to be audited, if they demand the subsidiary then you can kiss goodbye to NIO in within 3 years.

Edit: if it wasn’t a big deal then they would of made Chinese companies follow the rules from the beginning. It’s very clear they allowed China to bend the rules just to get access to the market but it’s becoming more of a problem than benefit.

Every single Chinese company has to use a proxy company to list in American exchanges. China sees them as illegal and has stated that it can and will enforce insolvency on illegal companies operating in China. China could kick NIO Inc out of China lol. That 76% then becomes worthless.

Thanks, I was also looking for this.
Was a $9 stock a month ago...why would you all in it when its over doubled so quickly. Risk reward seems pretty shitty.
Just like nothing stays green for too long, nothing stays red for too long either
Vix doubling by Friday ;)
I'll put the whole bottle up my ass if nothing exciting happens
HONK
Simple. Based on your record, next time you yolo your savings just do the opposite of what you wanted to do and you'll be swimming in money.
Lols battery day was epic
That's a good one
Inverse what people are doing here if they are buying NKLA puts then I’ll buy NKLA calls
So I can't tell if you're manipulating me to buy or sell here.... So I just put 10k into pltr
It takes time for this technology to be made, I wouldn’t bet yet that it won’t come to pass. Especially when we’re talking about Elon.
Lol I'm shilling TF out of GME everywhere, I feel like those guys that mess with those online coins with chains
People cant wait 2 weeks for PLTR to recover so they sell their shares at a loss. Some people not fit for patience
Currently 50% of my account ($60K) in PLTR.

Reckon I should sell remaining 50% tech stonks (AMZN, TMC) and go all-in on PLTR?..If it drops further (thinking if it goes to $21-ish...)
Ahhh makes sense. Let me win please😅 down 3k this week

Volatile but rising til 21, puts after
My original target was 40$ by December 31st. I set this when the stock was 32$ on the 17th Nov. If it holds strong and stays less of a meme I think this is still realistic. After 40$ I expect it to start a bigger run up into earnings in January, maybe ATH.
>Listen man, AirBNB consistently lose money in the last couple of years.

Ignore the growing revenue and profitable quarters while you're at it.

>They are a glorified home listing website with a nice design. Completely overvalued and not disruptive, at least not technically.

You called them a glorified booking.com which itself is valued at $85B and only has 3x bookings on rooms compared to AirBNB with 3x revenue.
They are disruptive because they've made hotels take a big hit in the tourism sector that nobody has done before.

>https://www.google.de/amp/s/skift.com/2020/03/12/airbnb-loses-276-million-and-6-other-takeaways-from-its-fourth-quarter/amp/

Literally read the numbers in your own link on how their revenue is blinking upwards compared to their competitors in a fucking pandemic.

>That's before considering the fact that the model is not sustainable and suffered regulation strikes in some places, for example Berlin, Germany.

You mean like UBER? Remember the regulations? 

Also a large part of their losses recently has been their increased upgrades, marketing and acquisitions. AirBNB isn't just staying in its spot, its directly trying to take on both the hotels sector and Booking holdings $85B cap. Enjoy losing money shorting an actual profitable unicorn. Lol
But battery day 🥺
We would have more volatility than QQQ.

Stop that shit, I want my Feb 24c's to print.
You need to read between the lines on this snake oil sales subreddit

90% of this place is memers with less than $1000 invested. Pushing meme stocks 

NIO, LI, XPENG, GME, PLTR = meme stocks

1.These stocks get pumped to insane %’s

2. Mainstream/ normies get onboard - this is when the boat has “sailed” 

3. The stock/ fund price will correct itself - hence the big dip in EV stocks and pltr 

I put my money into them and got out a week ago. Made a few hundred. Thats how you play this reddit.


Heres what you do

1. Remember everyone here is pushing an alternative agenda, lying, knows NOTHING about anything 

2. Wait for the next meme stock (roblox) and keep your eye on the common tickers in the subreddit 

3. If its been 3 weeks and thr stocks up 140% in 3 months (nio) - the ships already sailed 

4. Early bird catches the worm!

Remember any money you put into meme stocks, only do it if you genuinely dont care if it all went!

When a stock is already bad there's no more risk after it already dropped so hard or like these analysts would say "Downside". I genuinely think it might break 20 before it continues to crash best bull case scenario.

For NNOX (NASDAQ:NNOX), we notice a put option trade that happens to be bearish, expiring in 16 day(s) on December 18, 2020. A trader bought 479 contract(s) at a $20.00 strike. The trader or institution spent $31.1K on this trade with a price of $65.0 per contract. There were 1330 open contracts at this strike prior to today, and today 577 contract(s) were bought and sold.

Yeah but I’m even more retarded for buying puts 😎

Some, probably. Look for the ones that start bleeding and then do some DD on chances of that company being a scam. Chinese companies that are ready to be audited will suck up that capital as those fakes slowly begin offloading shares to make money within the time to enforcement. That money is unlikely to come back to the US in a large amount. People want to have diversification, and for all the bullshit China does, it’s still the best alternative to western markets for equities. Covid illustrated this pretty well. As the US gets worse, Chinese companies start seeing a boom, because they don’t give a shit about human rights so their response was scorched earth as fuck. They rebounded more quickly, showing a haven of resilience during uncertain times here.

SPACS are guaranteed at their listing price (NAV) if the merger falls through

I think PSTH is $20 not $22. But they essentially have an actual guaranteed floor.

Quality is whatever companies are willing to pay for. I find it funny that people just assume that Made in China is considered crap, especially when they are reading this comment on their iPhones. China is the country where they can mass produce replica Swiss watches to the point that the Swiss watchmakers can’t tell them apart (looking at you Panerai)

There's a ton of bullshit everywhere. In the workforce and academia. It's basically thin ice for everyone who is right of radical left. I miss pre-2013 (aka pre-Trayvon Martin being killed by clearly hispanic George Zimmerman) because shit was so much relaxed back then. Seems like everything you couldn't joke about today, you can joke about back then. Today, you just get someone getting offended and calling you a racist. I don't get how race went from something that everyone made jokes about to something that everyone got so sensitive about. I wonder what George Carlin would say about this stuff man. He'd probably shit on how everyone's just doing a song and dance so they don't get called racist lmao. Dude always kept it real.

Not at all. It’s a 17 year company, not recent. It was direct listing and not an IPO where 180 day lockup periods are established for true price discovery. Pltr more likely to go uppies!!

Loofa for loss
Who’s suckin stock cock?
Finviz.com is the best for looking up specific stock info. Don't worry about strategies too much in the beginning, learn debit spreads and stick with those. You're learn the most by losing money, so keep your losses small, the lessons are the same. Keep plays small or implement stop losses that trigger automatically and limit your risk. Best tip is buy far out exp dates. I'm talking 150 days or so. Spreads make them affordable, aim for 100% max gain and be willing to close positions at 20% gain if there's any uncertainty. Don't try to get rich just win more than you lose.
oh really, huh will have to go check it out, get on the us options game

Slow bleed. NQ die pls
Truly and honest question here:

How big brained is this?

Loading all of my accounts buying power into PSTH (30k) instead of just having it sit in buying power. 

As I need it I am selling shares to buy what I want, but anything I would otherwise keep in cash I am keeping I PSTH. 

My thinking is this bitch trades sideways so the loss/gain day to day is minimal but is/when PSTH hits big I will be there. 

Thoughts?
tards will buy SPCE
I wacked off so much yesterday trying to get PLTR to go up that I gave myself some sort of ballsack injury. Testy tubes are swol. Oww.

People see a bit of movement and think it’s some mass exodus. This is years of clickbait bullshit and people regurgitate it as fact.
seriously? do people really think just because they have crazy leaders and like to boast that the American empire is somehow actually a bunch of pussies?. It's no lie. America is still the big swinging dick on the world stage and China is not replacing them anytime soon. Also do you think that crossing into the pacific would pose any difficulty for the Yanks? they're already at strategically important locations. I'ts not like they'd just sit there to be fired upon....military tradition, training, superior officers (political climbers get pushed asside when competence is required - same can't be said of china), and the requisit industrial capacity to service and supply combined armed forces. Land, Sea, Air power. strategic alliances to fuck up trade routes, internal political disruption through psy-ops and propaganda, 5-eyes intel network, advanced weaponry research. America could easily destabilise china simply by making the new middle-class fear that they'd be sent back to times of starvation and hardship - political defection (brain drain etc). this is just off the top of my head. there's so much more.  China is vulnerable on too many fronts. Pretty sure Obama secured America hegemony via long-term plans involving Russia and Japan (an educated guess). Turkmenistan is most probably involved on the economic front too. Smart money is on the USA.
Nothing, just like everyday.
yea. I don’t think CRSR is going to just die. They should be poised to grow. However, the growth as of late has been unsustainable and based way too heavily in hype. This is one of those pump and dumps that occurs organically due to high demand influx for shares, with the wsb short bus and algos piling in.

There isn’t a product or service they have that has the profit margin and need to replace to give them a rapid increase in valuation over long term. Will they grow? Yeah. Will they grow like their price was showing? Ehhhh. 
I would be picking up LEAPS if they dropped below 30. If they don’t, well, there’s always another one.

Doesn't matter, they have an internal market now. No one can stop a train with 1.6 billion people in it. China not being the largest economy in the world was the fluke, not the other way around.

Well if it dumps more today I am gonna paperhands to protect gains
Isn't Russia's economy smaller than Texas's economy?
No way, bliat'!
Since you’re already asking, you already know it’s wrong.

But let’s assume they don’t go after you if you lose (big assumption), what can you possibly expect to get out of it, considering you didn’t deposit money. You think they would let you withdraw any of it if you ended up making a profitable trade?  In other words, what’s the best you could get out of all this, other than internet points?
so sold at $10 boutght at $25? great investor
Lol probably.

It intensifies housing shortages in major metropolitans and they deserve the money loss they experience. Fck this company
Those bees are a buzzing 🐝
Managers of companies already knew it wasn’t economical a long ass time ago. Those jobs didn’t just disappear overnight. Nobody gives a shit about manufacturing jobs because why the fuck would people want to pay more for shit. Made in America is a cute slogan but nobody wants to pay extra for mass produced shit.
it was down yesterday in pre market and then dumped even further so i think us PLTR holders are screwed either way lol.
When will CRSR hit >$40? Any guesses?
Count me in as I am certainly an autist 🤯
If you're about money then I get what you mean. I still work in an American company so the money is definitely better than what the average spainard makes. But in terms of people, quality of living I'd pick Europe any day

I'm no lawyer but I'm pretty sure the first thing you didn't want to do is admit your intent to committing fraud in an online forum. If you just yolo'd it and the men in suits came after you, at least you could plead ignorance :D

Agree, average TSLA PT is meaningless
IT manager /engineer here, 11 years. Email will die, instant messaging is the way. Incorporating security components and auditing tools with these messaging systems will encourage adaptation and drive usage for this new(er)way of communicating. Although email may never go away, businesses may find themselves migrating away from legacy solutions as tech giants push and prove messaging solutions.

PLTR, lol
Doesn't mean it will hit 780 instantly. Imo, it has room for another short burst past 600, but I think it will cool for a bit after that before potentially making a move to 700. Find someone who trades the stock tho, I'm just going on what I've been seeing.
It ain’t over until the dead cat bounces fukboy
Idk I've been playing since FIFA 13, I think 21 is one of the best one so far.

I’m gonna guess today will be same as yesterday. sell off at open and slow upward trend towards green
As an outside observer of the whole PLTR fiasco, I gotta say the memes have been 10/10. This one goes above and beyond all the others I've seen too, truly a masterpiece.
But don’t worry they have that Mach 16 engine coming online any day now
Been scrambling around pltr since the moment it IPO'd. Probably broke even compared to just buying shares and holding

I mean, Kentucky has the agriculture capability to pump that production through their hemp industry, and they have a decent inroad to vice product supply chains. Altria donates a lot to McConnell. They’re strategically invested in CRON. Those hillbillies love grass and growing shit on farms, so there’s your workforce, especially since weed isn’t that hard to grow. 
Marijuana is going to be legalized at some point. It’s just a matter of which states will have a stranglehold on supply and which companies will own em. Also, those in first get to make the rules and Monsanto the shit outta competition using seed patents and shit like that.

It is possible that the growth might come from the fact that people stuck indoors they renovated their homes. By this logic I don't think it will increase anymore so it is a COVID stock after all. If it's not this and is something else like an expansion etc then it might grow

>how could someone say something so brave and yet so controversial
Very likely 13, lock-in profits
I was at 27% before pltr fell out of the sky it’s not so bad if you don’t be retarded. You might get +100% one week but you’ll be down 100% the next playing weeklies. [my gains ](https://imgur.com/gallery/ZHbf1gI)

You'd be absolutely wrong then. It's almost double that percent.
The US can manufacture goods at the same pace as China 10 fold. But the question is whether or not it's economical. The US has one of the most qualified and experienced work forces out there but at a premium. If we started giving a shit about manufacturing again jobs would come back.
>  I think that's how you get such low price targets because people are still trying to value companies like Tesla conservatively based on their present value and not the meme power

It’ll be fine 3-6 months long term. Expect sell off this week
Even if you tell each other privately, it’s well
Although Trump's lawsuit will come to the highest federal court, But Trump is likely to fail in the next link, just like every time human beings are destroyed by China in the global Chinese clamor. This time, China would rather abandon Xi Jinping in order to protect Chinese Americans! Chinese Americans are doing not enough, which is equivalent to doing the opposite, They haven’t said how Chinese all over the world killed all Americans. 
So truly rely on open system and Western people that is our principles, we need to do armed struggles. The premise of armed struggle is "the people know the true crime of China."  We can only rely on Western people, not Asians and people of color.
Even if the white people only tell each other privately!


Trump's lawsuit failed in Pennsylvania
This shows that there is no judge this profession in the US, the entire United States has been fully controlled by brain control! Even the rats were scurrying around the street with people wearing rat's heads, this is the Brain-control technology. In fact, the kitchen of the citizens were destroyed by Chinese, not the rats. In order to harm the US, China has new way every day, fire, shooting, "floyd", 737max, coronary virus, gay, climate, feminist ...
Only by eliminating brain control can Americans stop being slaves. 

Iran nuclear scientist was killed
In fact, this murder was done by China, In order to bring the goal of the war to Iran, not China. This was done by Brain Control, Mossad can't go to Iran to attack Iranian scientists, which can not prevent Iran's nuclear research. Trump's reaction to this, because it is beneficial to Trump's re-election, so small Trump's military power. Like ”Soleimani”, it only increase hatred.
This indicates that Biden is a anti-revolution completely, the people can't have any fantasy for him.


After killed Maradona, China took another step toward its goal
Once again, there was a public murder, and only Trumps were still disobedient. HumanHuman only had a few decades when they had image materials and no brain control. Now only relying on brain-controlled cannibalism to become a star, no arts, no civilization in the world. In contemporary technology, human will never have freedom, and be put in “matrix” by China and connected to a computer to live a lifetime in a dream.


Why is Biden wrong?
Not say:he helped China kill all American people; Surrendered to China; changing the world to brain control; exterminating human civilization……
Only say he contact with China: You married a wife. She is wanting to kill you every day, wants to put poison in your bowl, you still eat his food every day yet, She wants to kill you with a knife every night, You are still sleeping on the same bed with her.


Why did the Chinese suddenly become good?
Suddenly U.S. Chinese support Trump, opposes election fraud. Even the Chinese do not know why the Chinese democracy activists have become good people? Because they intend to abandon exaggerating Biden, his crazy fraud is easily exposed! China wants to turn criminals into aristocrats and rulers. All U.S. Chinese killed all western people! China wants to create another victory like the independence of Taiwan, the democratic movement, and East Turkistan.



About me
（Therefore, for 20 years, all world'politics have been led by Tianjin”zhi bu sheng huo”magazine where I worked. Now Zhang Tianying,police Cui,police Zhang Yi and Tianjin police officers are killing Amy Coney Barrett Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court by brand -control! Please inform her.）
  China has ruined me, so ruling the world. For more than 20 years, China has destroyed me and destroyed the bodies of stars, elites and politicians all over the world. China has also controlled brain control personnel around the world, stealing technology, controlling political parties, and ruling the world!
  I have been maimed by China for the rest of my life. I didn't know anything before and didn't know China's brain control technology.
  Among them, all my relatives did a lot of bad things, they destroyed all humanity!
  People of justice all over the world have been helping me, but China’s aggression has made them extremely dangerous. I still want to fight for this world！
  China has cut off my genitals, muscles, organs, bones, and brain. China does not allow me to have work, money, wife, relatives, or friends. Almost all people in China are involved in killing my mother.
  If I return to China, I think I will die soon, in a prison or mental hospital.
  My father and all my relatives are the most direct killers who killed my mother, me, my sister and the people of the world!
  China ruined all my money and health. OnlyOnly after this， China told me some truths. I didn't know about brain control before.
  I knew things lately, Maybe Americans have gone bad！So I should go to the United States earlier, But I am blocked by China.


Only rely on the guns
Election fraud and unfair medias alone indicate that U.S. is undergoing a coup. The coup is not only against the president, but also against the people. Only people and guns can re-put justice into the system!


The upper people can never rely on elections
China has done a lot of bad things in the US by rogues and democratic party, The US has been perished. Now Illiterate housewives lead the country, Traitors are killing the people and became presidential candidates.
For example immigrant population, because of the democratic system, the US has become a Low-level country. In theory, the upper people can never win.
America is no longer America. 


will be only massacre in U.S.
Will be from Pearl Harbor to Auschwitz, Will not just Brain-control wave guns.
Trump will be put into prisons; Artistic theory will be publicly modified; thus, the real athletes will be put into mental hospitals, and the real artists will be killed. All strong people will be negatived, and be killed. All things immediately.
Because China and the US Democratic Party want a Brain-control world, they only need to do one thing----to kill all good people!


The election is completely controlled by the Brain-control
Although some good people are Brain-control player.
Brain-control player:” In order to find and kill the good people, China deliberately made Trump win in 2016.” In a sentence, I understood all things! The names of the states and the results of the votes show that the brain control completely controls the election results. So we got all the correct explanations: Why did Trump announce victory, stoping counting, to sue? Why did U.S. Chinese support Trump? In recent years, all the world things were inorder to lure good people, find and kill them. So Trump has tried to do the biggest effort in limited power, he can't say brain control, can't launch the war, can't tell people the truth ...... Trump is the only good person.
So China made shootings and wanted to prevent people from uprising by banning guns. China doesn’t want the Systems, economy, politics, only needs to dominate brain-controls. All brain controllers are low essence. Just kill all good people, China can rule the world! The people don't know this knowledge.
Only Chinese and Obama do not let me eat, Bidden is not that. So the American people should go to civil war, only need to kill all U.S. Chinese.


The law theory of Sue in the election
Don't require evidence for Brain-control, The judges should strongly agree with Trump’s prosecution. System'Americans have to fully support Sichuan from justice and all areas. People's uprising, system support, judicial in-depth intervention are right way for Brain-control, Brain-control is no evidences, no in the laws, no public opinion.


What’s all of this world
It's brain control. All political, economic, cultural, scientific, social life is directed by brain control, no open systems, only brain-control system.
Every thing in dark is sinful. Changing body properties by particle beam irradiation, then use different waves to activate various pre-made body, then Get the needed flesh, parts or whole. You are easily “possessed" by others with Ubiquitous waves this world. Others can know your thoughts, control your thoughts and behaviors.
Humans only divide into good and bad, the controlled people are good, the controller are bad. No border, no systems, so some questions had answer, China rules the world because it controlled brain controllers all of world.
It is interesting that the West surrendered China, because politicians are just for a little benefit. The western people are extremely miserable, China's hereditary "anthropophagy" system was transplanted to the West, Western flesh, skills, knowledge, ideas, temperament, social status, willpower…… are all “eaten”, brain control technology can get everything of human by waves.


Because this world is a slaughter of the weak people to the strong people
Because of being led by China, the world’s contradiction is between brain control and non-brain control, that’s a contradiction between the weak people and the strong people too. The Russians are strong and will not be very willing to be ruled by China in the future. All Western people have been killed by China, western countries are so willing, because they are the capitalist system.
But Russia is not the capitalist system.

Well Chinese manufacturing is good enough for your phones. The whole “quality” myth is simply that- a myth. Quality in Chinese manufacturing, unsurprisingly for the largest industrial country in the world, varies considerably between factories and sectors.
I think that's already factored as defense spending.

being complied doesn’t mean more transparency in chinese companies. Both Luckin coffee and Kandi were already being complied and they still defrauded investors. And this bill gives chinese companies 3 years to comply. So shady chinese companies will have plenty of time to take fomo money and disappear.
hmm....
pretty sure investors have just been pumping the market over night, waiting for idiots like us to fomo in, and selling. buy the dip, sell at open. there’s enough tendies for all of us.
Was thinking the same. Yesterday biggest red was only In pre market, not in after market. So hopeful it will be the same today.
Because stonks go up retard
Platinum is green every day

Like yeah he's promised he's changed, yeah he's been acting really nice to me today (green pre-market), but I can't help but be huddled in the corner in great fear waiting for him to lash out at me again 😭😭
Sure am I glad I didn't cheat on my beloved NIO with that harlot peanut company ran by a man with crazy hair
I bought puts cause I think yall are retards.

I mean, I'm retarded too, but this time it paid off.

About 50/50, either goes sideways or continues to dump.
Pro tip: buy the CRM dip. Very solid earnings and outlook. Wall Street just skeptical of slack deal.

I don't think 20 year olds have ever been worth more than about 2k. Maybe other than right after the war and the G.I. bill where you could get a free farm or free college after you put your life on the line and go fight a war for us. It has always been about a 0$ net worth the bigger issue is that now there is a huge negative net worth.

That is what we said about the ANT IPO, and then the anti-trust regs, now this vote. None of those times did it hold when more news was released, every time it dumped after already sliding to "priced in".

Not saying I -want- it to dump, I'm balls deep in feb calls. Just if it -does- dump I am going to buy more.

Maybe I am wrong for once doesn't really bother me that much, green is better than red for me.

On top of the facts you’re learning today from other commenters, quality is inconsistent in smaller countries that are winning factories away from China. Made in China ain’t good quality but manufacturers and companies that contract them know what to expect. It’s inconsistency that drives corporations crazy

As a german retard i have only been watching Frankfurt, but i bet that most other exchanges in europe are the same:  


For u.s. stocks like PLTR, the european market does not matter. It just follows whatever NYSE does. What you are seeing is mainly due to different time zones and closing times.  


NYSE trading hours: 09:30 am - 4:00 pm EST  
Frankfurt trading hours: 08:00 am - 08:00 pm CET  


Now CET is 6 hours ahead of EST. That means when Frankfurt closed yesterday at 08:00 pm CET, it was 02:00 pm EST.  
Yesterday at 02:00 pm EST, PLTR was around its lowest point somewhere between $21 - $22.  
$21,82 = 18€ - and that is where PLTR closed in Frankfurt yesterday. Because it, more or less, copies whatever the u.s. market does. Only that Frankfurt closes when it is only 02:00 pm in New York. So the next day Frankfurt opens, it starts trading wherever NYSE ended at 04:00 pm EST, when Frankfurt was already closed. NYSE closed at $22.51 yesterday, and $23.19 after hours. $23.19 = 19.13€. Now look where Frankfurt opened: 19.20€. It is up to 19.40€ now.  
In 2 minutes, at 10:00 CET or 04:00 am EST, when premarket starts, you will see that Frankfurt will adjust to what premarket in the u.s. does.  


The only time where it is interesting to look at european markets for mainly u.s. stocks like PLTR is when there where news, like earnings, announced after NYSE trading hours. Because then europe reacts first.  


That all being said: $PLTR to the fucking MOOOOOOOON! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
LOL you are as paranoid as it gets my man take the tinfoil hat off and instead of being suspicious of some kids you’ve never talked try talking to them

Not always, there's some exceptions. Companies who work on the F-35 don't have to be US Citizens or Green Card Holders to be on facilities. There's just super strict rules on export authorization and control.

right?! and his big data company with infinite tendies from DoD contracts. they have three customers and they chose not to disclose one of them lolll so boss
That’s pretty much as far off as possible lol. People in China rightfully see that the US has the best colleges in the world. And if you’re not getting into a top Chinese university but you’re rich...why not pay extra and send em to some “prestigious” US school? Keep in mind the schools love it because their tuition is so much higher and they don’t get financial aid. Also for Chinese bc of the 1 child policy many kids are spoiled af. So if you’re rich...and your 1 kid wants that Porsche...idk lol
thoughts on nio long term?
10k wall at 43. MM’s know Pfizer’s gonna fucking moon to 60

PLTR and TSLA opening with hulk green dildos. Feels good thank you GS.
They sell the codes for downloading games and most of them are cheaper than buying from the xbox online store. Can’t speak for PS but it’s prob the same
Could dump this morning because of headlines about the vote.
Retail investors are dumb.
Why spend all your own taxpayer money on military inventions when you can just copy the American government wasting their own to build the next dumbass star wars toy. Pretty smart really, they don't need to beat the US in the arms race, they just need to keep up, and that gives them an edge economically because they have to divert less to research and development.

He was on an ad on my YouTube video subscribed for the LULZ and scrolled down for this beauty.
Seems about right. Us autists can start trading in weekly calls instead of dollars.
I let a 3000% option gain (+28000) turn into a 200%.   I also bought 22k worth of monthly expiring options on SPG when I thought they were coming back around in August and lost all but 800 of it.
Next week, December 10th! Although technically evening on December 9th for US folks, 6pm here

Best app to see a stock in real time premarket?
How pissed are you gonna be when bond yields continue going up and boomer stocks outpace tech stocks? Crazy? HSBC(17.90-24), CRS(17.50-26), VRS(7.50-11.00), IMMU(8.90-88.00), GS(197.50-212), LTRPB(3.00-$128.00), and the list could go on.
Ha
Bought at 24 sold at 30 two days later since I tend to have paper hands... of course this was with shares and I only had a 100 dollars so I made like $20...feels good.
I’m holding onto my 300 sell short share cuz this can be a long fight

My guy. That’s what you’re looking for.
lost 48 million in a week its not a lot because i still got 359 million so 48 million really isn't much might invest in some gold bars cause losing 359 million would hurt but 48 million isn't bad. My net worth is 359 million so if you add 48 million it would be 400 million but I lost it so subtract 48 million doesn't bother me pretty stupid move but live and learn. Whats your story? I lost 48 million btw because 359 million is my net worth now.

You didn't know that Europe is getting spoiled by the USA? Look at the 5 eyes reports and the industrial spying and spoiling American secret services have been operating against French and German companies (among many others obviously).
that would mean that BABA is going to open up higher this morning lmao, like what do you mean?
 Mmm, Tootski?
Probably holding PLTR too long and then selling TSLA at its dip. Buying back into tesla, calls and shares, but the premium is going to be a kick in the ass for sure
Hey if you're comfortable with having an extra layer of risk, be my guest lol.

You're right NIO is probably fine..but dont be shocked if people exit this week. If you're long you're most likely gucci. If you have weekles GL baby.
Red futures, destroyed dollar. Just destroy it more so futures can go up more. We strive to be like Zimbabwe.
I'm legit so far left in some ways that I am an actual nutcase. but even I'm irritated by some of this shite. Not wanting illegal immigrants in the country or a hard cap on numbers is totally fair and should be up for discussion. Can't just call someone a racist for wanting to do that.

Weed pumps and dumps all the time (check the 1y and 3y chart of whatever stock you have) this will be no different don’t get caught holding the bag.
maybe
I am autistic but this is what I think - TSLA goes up to $650-$700 by 24th Dec, after that it dumps to $600-$650 maybe less. Who knows after that? Long term I think it’s the way of future and has basically unlimited upside.

Covid19 is a bargaining chip for the left to impose their big government ideals on a free country that they believe needs to be more like europe. Their lack of interest or concern regarding covid 19 whenever their side participates in activities or behavior deemed unsafe due to the virus completely tore down any of my concern of the actual dangers and I’m blackpilled that they want to beat society into submitting to this as normal, and attack your character for not doing so

Ah, interesting. Thanks for clearing that up. 

Definitely a lot more preferential than US STCG rates, but that marginal tax rate on ordinary income more than makes up for it at least personally speaking. 

Enjoy that though, sounds nice to not have to worry too much about the tax man when it comes to high-risk plays.

Well if you are judging a company by who manages it pltr is the one for you it has the best pedigree of founders. Pay pall mafia went on to generate 2 trillion dollars in companies. Peter Theil was an angel in Facebook, Elon, and now Karp is delivering a product that's going to be worth hundreds of billions once they get their platform out to more and more companies.

I haven’t, but will sure read through that as well, there are so many research need to be done on this. Ah, remind me of good old days reading through NKLA sec filings and realize they have zero ip& giving shares to Bosch&iveco like a bitch. But so far pltr seems legit
For all you out there pumping *cough* i mean who did your DD on GME calls and are finally about to move out of your wife's boyfriends basement. You still have a few days to sign up for secret Santa. Who knows maybe you and your wife will match and she'll gift you one of those blowjob things you always hear her giving her boyfriend. 

Maybe this could be your chance to get matched with some new "girl" and you guys can move in together until your wife and boyfriend leave your house. 

If you're crying over your losses on PLTR the past two days this could be your chance to be gifted something valuable you can sell just to lose all that money all over again. 

Either way look at this for those of you that got gainz you're charity for some poor person who doesn't know they should've invested because stonks I mean stocks always go up and make their Christmas awesome. For those of you that posted loss porn this is your last and final YOLO before letting your wife's boyfriend put you on onlyfans

I’m about to go to bed but PM me and I can help answer some questions more in depth in the morning.

But long story short, you’re going to have to file. The IRS needs a record of your transactions and to verify that you actually incurred these losses (proceeds of sales vs basis). Plus, you’ll be able to carry forward these losses to offset future income when you do start generating an income and/or becoming profitable with these trades.

Also, how bad can it be to tell your mom that you’re trading? Chalk it up to you’re learning and the market is volatile, but point out the pros of how much you’re learning and even if you’re considering pursuing a career in the field. Also, this might be a good point to reflect where your trades went wrong and to learn from them. I started pretty young as well and made my fair share of mistakes. It becomes a lot better when you learn not to repeat them. 

Best of luck and hope this helps.
It’s not WSB that’s piling in alone. We are being front run by large money. We move shit I promise you. Our money+big money.

Go with ur instinct tho not mine. I got rid of everything chinese Monday bc shit reminds me of attempting to be optimistic on Boeing. Bad news after bad news, after bad news, after bad news...
honestly, i think its time for the Chinese EV bounceback. Panic selling is over. NIO just got price target upgrade from Goldman Sachs, amongst other good news. Production was up over 100% in November. If you can secure a few january calls for cheap at market prices open you have very high chances of profit.

Stop Price - The quoted price at which the action will be triggered 

Limit Price - The lowest acceptable price at which you're willing to trade the asset

So it's basically two separate actions merged into one for convenience.  The first action is to place an order for you automatically when a certain quoted price is reached ( the stop ).  The second action ( the limit ) is just a regular limit order which tells it what order you want to place.

Ex.  Stop $45 Limit $44

If the quoted price hits $45, a limit order for $44 will be immediately placed on your behalf.  Meaning it won't be sold for anything less than $44, but if the market is very liquid and sell pressure is not insane, you can expect it to be sold at a much better price ( closer to $45 )

With options, this gets trickier since they tend to have a lot less liquidity and wider spreads so keep that in mind.
Hoping to sell off my too-many TSLA calls on the early green dildos.

You really think we moved that much production out of China? No
I'm classically liberal/moderate. I was the guy the democratic party was tried to appeal to in 2008/2012. I was into Obama in 08/12 and was rooting for him to win in 08. Was pretty apathetic in 12. Not anymore... Apparently I'm a conservative nutjob conspiracy theorist. 

I'm just not about riots, violence, and all the liberals trying to coerce you into their frame of mind. Not into cancel culture. Not into being attacked or called racist/bigot because I don't agree with their views. I just want to live my life without them trying to bully me into their crap. Also, I'm especially not keen on paying for fucking Becky's women's studies degree. The ROI on that shit is probably 0%

This klutz is constantly making rules for himself that he will never achieve. Here is a thought: what if the rules you make for yourself are already flawed? Meaning any derivation that comes from within you cannot possibly be right because you are an imbecilic entity that cannot be the prognosticar of right and wrong, good or bad.

You will never know the best version of yourself because you are not equipped with the right mental apparatus to distinguish virtuous characteristics. Your best shot at this is being around someone that is; unfortunately most highly capable and successful people loathe those who give in to self pity. 
I don’t see you ever getting out of your current predicament.

It's still cheaper to manufacture goods in China than any other country thanks to china's labor laws and government subsidies. However China's young labor pool is shrinking so in 20-30 years their going to be fucked up out of this world.

Luckin coffe used a PCAOB-complied auditor, and yet they still committed accounting fraud and didn’t get caught until too late. Everyone was FOMO into luckin coffee thinking it is the next chinese starbuck. At the end, people lost their saving after luckin cofffee delisted.
Now people fomo into chinese ev thinking they found the next chinese tesla, and there is no way they will commit accounting fraud this time. Guess what, look up what happened to Kandi who also used a PCAOB-complied auditor. But Nio, Xpeng, and Li Auto are different, right!?

Wow this is not even retarded in a funny way. This is just pure stupidity. Even for this sub, this gotta be one of the most stupid things I've ever seen. Like the risk/reward ratio is way out of proportion.

Appreciate the input. I’ve used teams professionally for awhile and slack just casually a few times (very limited) for various clubs I’m in and it seems to me that teams has all the features you just described besides maybe some of the zoom integrations and sleek chat integrations. Microsoft has been rapidly updating teams over the past few months and there are a ton a plugins for similar stuff that people don’t bother to explore (they don’t make the obvious). I totally get what you are saying about the UX and UI from a look and feel perspective. Slack is much cleaner, nicer to look at, more user friendly and intuitive. I’ll have to look at some of chat features like the /zoom you mentioned because that sounds like a nice productivity booster. From my perspective the value slack adds has to be significant for them to take any market share away from companies that already use the Microsoft suite for other reasons. With teams or google meet being essentially free a company has to literally elect to take a loss to use slack instead. Microsoft and google have a ridiculous amount of software engineering man-power and they can just clone slack anything slack does. They won’t likely ever be as sexy as slack but they have an inherent ecosystem moat that slack will have to overcome. If slack is now going to be lumped in with saleforces ecosystem for little to no additional cost I could see how it could win, but then I struggle to see the value in the acquisition for salesforce. Again feedback appreciated and i really should probably go use slack more myself if im going to justify my current point of view.
The election of 2000 was top 3 most important event in American history. 9/11 wouldn’t have happened under Gore (Clinton admin was focused on al qaeda which caused bush admin to spitefully ignore), and without 9/11, we wouldn’t have had 2008 collapse, ISIS/Iraq war, Trump, and China ultimately becoming #1. And Gore won 2000. So it’s pretty tragic. But this isn’t a very hot take.

I don’t have a horse in that race, but having worked in IT for a long while, I have to wonder why it would go back up. 
CRSR seems like a Covid stock. Home bound, both for work and for play, you upgrade your system. You get all Corsair shit because it’s the easiest thing to find on the shelf at Best Buy or it’s in Facebook ads. Here’s the thing though: PC parts don’t need to be replaced ultra frequently. Most people look at 80 bucks for a keyboard, take the dive, then have it for years. What market cap is left to capture? 
LOGI has enterprise on lock. Our hardware vendor would ask if I had a fucking stroke if I requestioned a bunch of Corsair gear for end users. Organizational buying is the only area gear gets changed fast enough to generate a decent profit margin. 
Let’s put it like this: what are 2 products or services Corsair offers that will be relevant and profitable post-COVID? 
Isn’t it easier to just take profit at the top? All the purchases for Christmas are wrapping up. Holidays will be over soon. Q4 will probably be a blow out of expectation. Then what? What keeps Corsair relevant in 2021 Q1? 2021 Q3?

Honestly I’ve been doing this for 15 years and I think a lot of research is borderline scam
Yea I'm pretty not about it. Like, my ass is fucking gross, it's a gross place. My girl is pretty damn hot and takes care of her self, got that thick booty and such, but she's a human. I'm a human. We basically, in a biology sense, have the same ass, and NO POSSIBLE amount of cleaning and care and gender differences turns the toxic no-man's land that is my human asshole into a place I want to put my tongue.

I actually don't know if we will get as much of a pop this time.

There was an analyst downgrade last month to sell with a price target of $55. That's probably what's keeping this stock on the downtrend. 

I'm thinking if earnings go well there will be a good small pop, but when an analyst upgrades the price target it will soar. So I'm thinking about buying longer out calls
I drew a lot of lines, looked at rsi’s and shit & sifted through tweets mentioning various tickers all leading me to believe a massive correction is about to happen. So I’m gonna wake up bright an early at 6:30AM and buy SPY 400c 12/31

As someone who has about 2-3k in WMT right now I think the argument for it is less about the product itself and the fact it isn’t valued as a tech stock atm. If WMT+ has extremely strong numbers (high estimates are 20mil households) they become an e-commerce stock, and not just a retail stock. If this happens their valuation is ridiculously low in comparison to others in the same grouping (p/e wise). In turn their valuation should be closer to 250-300 to be comparable, SHOP p/e is 660 AMZN is 93 WMT is 21. Lastly no one is considering breaking up WMT through anti trust unlike AMZN.

At launch meaning getting shares in the IPO or buying on day 1? The day 1 surge is usually the difference between the IPO price and the first trade on the exchange. Take SNOW, which listed in September. It was priced at $120 - that’s what people who got shares in the IPO paid - and the first trade on the exchange was $245. Closing price in day 1 was $254.

Lol I don’t think anyone could have imagine an almost bankrupt ev company go from 2.40 to 57.  But, a 12 dollar JWN stock returning mean in 2021, well kids that’s how grandad made his first million in the crash of 2020
The actual float of CRSR is tiny. If you have 20 million dollars, you can have a very good chance of deciding which direction the stock will trade that day or even week. That's why it's important to buy it because it's a solid company. Id buy limitless amounts around $30 if you are looking for a stable meme stock w good growth in hard figures. They sell physical hardware so...nothing magic about it but they are rapidly growing sales in a rapidly growing marketplace. Should it go below $30, it's an absolute steal. I have been waiting to get back in after selling off @ $47, because, honestly, it's runnup was way to fast to make sense, and with my $50 EOY price target, I decided to take profits early. Now, before anyone says wow what genius, I made some retarded options plays on it too and got greedy, but still has provided most of my major gains for the year.
the 10th I believe.  It would do two things for me that I've been wanting to do:  get a 'recovery' stock, and get in at an IPO.

Because investing in a company (NIO I’m looking at you) that goes from 2.40 to 57 in a span of 9 months has significantly more profit to be made than in a company that is just recovering from covid lows. People dont care about the risk, they want the highest profit possible

You're investing in stock, not a company.  Stock is driven by investor sentiments primarily, and while those sentiments tend to be related to financial results, it's not bound in any way.  If a company is fiscally solid, but they were way overhyped, a tiny bump in the road financially can cause the stock price to plummet.  Planatir probably isn't going anywhere, they may be a good long term hold, but the market was obviously very emotional about them.

For the life of me will never understand the reasoning of you guys going in on meme stocks when the recovery trade was the less risky way to get rich. Fuck exploring new territory, I’m all about return to the mean
Fuck, I went on a date with a 35 yr so I don't feel like an old perv.   Fuck, bitches rot quick after 28 or something

Helpful. Makes you strike out a lot bc you’re so damn aggressive but it’s the law of averages. You want it so bad you try with so many so 20 won’t give you sex but 3 will come over. Lol
Bloomberg Terminal is pretty useless for private investors. We have one at my Uni and it didn't really help me, and I informed myself pretty good on how to use it.
Some jackass was 100% right on FSLY back when most of us had no clue what it was but he wouldn't shut the fuck up about it and got banned. Still worth it because there are 500 legit bans for that one or two legit 100 baggers.

Uhhhh thanks “surgeon Loki” lmao

2. Has anyone made an investment generator? Preferably one that does all this gay shit for me and decides its a "buy"/profitable play? Even if it doesn't, complete random is probably better than what a lot of folks here do, I'd buy a couple things from there as lottos lol. That'd be dope, you could sell a ton of ads, people would use the site. Pay me 2% commission plz for being a genius.

There is a difference between a discretionary buy or sell which is what they report at the end of each trading day and a mechanical one due to the ETF construct. I don't give any weight to the latter
Lmfao what if voting to keep WSB off the board is what triggered the squeeze
meh
Could be dehydration too I do have a nasty headache rn
I wish Robinhood had an option to place a stop loss and a profit limit at the same time? Like sell my option if it hits -30 and sell if it hits +30. Then you’d never have to watch it and you know your max gain and max loss. Does this make sense? Maybe there is an option and I’m not doing it right? Its just like if I’m sleeping or some shit and I set a stop loss the night before. Okay that protects me from losing more than I want, but it doesn’t sell my option when it hits whatever profit I had in mind.
Is being on cycle helpful or hurtful for trying to pull girls?

Usually the ticker changes, IF it is stripe it *might be* something like STRP after the merger. They would announce long before what the new ticker will be. If you hold PSTH when it happens those shares will just become STRP.

You truly belong in this sub. He sold 35% because he literally had to for the DPO. Insiders can’t even sell until 2021 starts because that’s when lockup ends
Are **all** options contracts for 100 shares, or are there exceptions? Like, I can’t imagine somebody doing options for 100 shares of BRK.A ($350k per share) or even for something like GOOGL that is $1800 per share.
There’s a motherfucking pandemic ongoing. Economic growth is going to be glacial, and we’re borrowing against the future to prevent some apocalyptic financial shit now.
But real talk start selling calls like yesterday. Use the premium to average down.

*"I've been pumping this thing telling people it's Stripe to generate hype, but that totally doesn't matter that I'm just lying and it isn't actually Stripe!"*

And it does matter because a lot of hype chasers are going to dump it on the merger announcement when it's finally revealed that it isn't Stripe, which anyone who wasn't blind, deaf and dumb knew already.

Something something GME pump
Make sure you don’t buy the same stock (from which you lost money) within the next 30days after your loss. In other words if you buy TSLA 600 and sell 500 (-100 loss) you can claim as loss, but if you buy Tesla again then the original loss doesn’t count anymore, that’s called a wash sale.

Man who tf knows. Market seems to be changed forever or has evolved into something not recorded yet so we don’t know what we are dealing with rn.
Your brokerage will give you a form after the close of the year with your tax info on it. If you generated a loss, up to $3k can be deducted against current year income, and the rest can be carried forward indefinitely. If you're self-filing with turbotax, just upload the form into the software and it will calculate everything for you. 

If you didn't generate a loss or a gain, you won't be liable for taxes. Also, you won't be liable for taxes if you generated a loss obviously. If you made a gain, it depends on your other income, nature of the capital gains (short-term or long-term), in order to determine your tax liability.
yea but the taste? i feel like as much as i clean my ass it still smells like shit
So I guess we won’t be watching that guy eat shit after all.
You mean Bagholders Anonymous?
OP thanks for sharing this!
One thing I've never quite understood why or when you would ever want to sell ITM and especially deep ITM options. If they're alreayd ITM, a high chance they'd be excercised quickly, right? If not, why not? And what situations are good for selling deep ITM options?
went grill pill
Dude, can someone explain to me why every time GME is mentioned, it’s accompanied by the someone saying it’ll be a *short squeeze*?
I bought EA calls the day Apex released, took it up to 5k profit. Then, Anthem released, and I rode it all the way down to -100. I took a ~4 month break after that. 

You learn a lot about yourself in the stock market.

Please don’t say that, I don’t know shit. Exhibit A. I’m posting in here at 1 AM when I have an extremely important audit tomorrow. 
Exhibit B. I liquidated most of my gambling portfolio to go all in on GME shares and a handful of calls. 

You know what’s going to dick down China way harder in the long run than this bill? The US stepping back on to the national stage in an active capacity. Trump would’ve been rough for their immediate future, but he was great for increasing their soft power on the global stage and speeding up a bunch of trade deals for them. Oh, and the belt & road initiative probably benefitted too. China doesn’t give a shit if a bunch of their peasant class die, so what’s 4 or 8 years of tariffs when your biggest competitor is alienating all of their allies and losing power diplomatically?
average cost?

What i dont get is how the fuck are these dealers hedging all the delta from the calls. With calls dealers need to hedge like 10% of the float from just WSB alone
tastes pretty good tbh
You're kidding right? Your first marginal tax bracket rate is over 30%. That's absurd, close to the highest regular income tax bracket here in the US.
What if PTLR acts like FSLY, they had a huge drop...followed by another slide before rebounding.

Hi
I see people saying PLTR will be $50 by March. If you really believe it drop $1000 on OTM monthlies right now. If you are confident it’ll be an easy 10x for you

Huge stim news tomorrow. Dems and Repubs have nearly signed off on $908 B initial bill written by bipartisan committee. Congress needs to show progress before vacay since it’s now the #1 concern of constituents. About 20% of the bill is for airlines. Spy calls should print tomorrow, too.
PLTR down bigly, GME went down $4 from Monday and is going lower prob. Everyone’s over meme stocks and we’re back to making good plays
I think the point there was just that volatility was insane and it was fun to play with the market. Sleepy grandpa's market probably won't feel like such a casino :(
Up. Bigly.
This post is still up? That's neat. Can't wait for it to be 420.69 a share for the offering and all the post here to be "why iS It So eXPeNsIvE iTs jUsT A dUmB GaMe LoL"

Your down 90% just give it up dude
If you don’t have a long term mindset, your ass will get clapped sooner or later. Even the people that hit it big tend to revert to the mean, because that mentality chooses to ignore the probability of success. 

I lost 15k last year almost exclusively on options trades. Many, many options trades. I’m 10% down on my account, after starting the year down 80%. Almost exclusively stock. Focus on your return percent, not your cash gain. 

There was a post the other day where someone made 40k profit on one play. But, it was a ~50% return on an option play, which means he stood to lost more than 40k on a single option play, which is just foolish. Though the play worked out, it’s almost as if he’s already lost all his money. It’s just a matter of time.
I made my point but you’re too dense to understand it. Your comment history also explains your magnificent critical thinking by going in on every meme stock mentioned in this sub. So right back at you, but with actual reasons, you are seriously dumb as fuck.

It keeps going up in Frankfurt and Munich, so far so good.
It pisses me off when I see people that do dumb shit like that and get rewarded. My friend bought 50k of Kodak at fucking $18 and still made 200% off it. I buy an option on something at the money and a few months out and it’s -90% by the end of the first week lol.
where is SQ up?
S&P p/e10 ratio sitting at 32.4.... Historical average range dating back to 1890 with inflation adjusted is between 14.8 - 17.7

It broke above the range in '93 and the only time we've hit "fair value" since was 08 when it nearly acted as a bottom and we hit 13.3

So are we in a bubble? That's basically been building for 30 years? Or has access to the stock market for the average person become so much easier that valuations are reflecting that? 

I think both, and we'll correct, but closer to the 22 range... And that could take 10+ more years

Don’t buy Palantir until after March. 80% of insiders shares are still locked up and in March they can sell them all.
That's a really good point actually and that's what it all comes down to. I think Palantir's software is technically unmatched. The only problem is how much they can lower costs and how fast they can roll it out. I think PLTR's management made it clear that scalability is a main strategic goal and it just comes down to whether or not they can achieve that. I think they can. If they do their current valuation will look like a joke.

This would put USA in massive risk of runoff inflation due to the unlimited money printing. The currency will depreciate like crazy.

For years I never listened when everyone said “Make sure you get enough fiber.” And I know some of you in here aren’t getting enough fiber either. Wiping and wiping and wiping  💩🚽🧻. Or showing smug superiority at using a bidet (“Oh look how classy I am, spraying off my diarrhea while you heathens wipe it off with pieces of paper”).

It doesn’t have to be that way. You don’t have to constantly take a fire hose to your asshole or wipe until it’s raw. Get fiber. Whether that be through food or Metamucil. No more endlessly wiping a sharpie. No more streaks. Much less stomach pain. Now your asshole will be primed and ready for whatever terrible decisions you make. Like buying JNUG at the top.

**[And you are lynching Negroes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/And you are lynching Negroes)**

"And you are lynching Negroes" (Russian: "А у вас негров линчуют", A u vas negrov linchuyut) (which also means "Yet, in your [country], [they] lynch Negroes") and the later "And you are hanging blacks" are catchphrases that describe or satirize Soviet Union response to United States criticisms of Soviet human rights violations.The Soviet media frequently covered racial discrimination, financial crises, and unemployment in the United States, which were identified as failings of the capitalist system that had been erased by state socialism. Lynchings of African Americans were brought up as an embarrassing skeleton in the closet for the U.S., which the Soviets used as a form of rhetorical ammunition when reproached for their own perceived economic and social failings. After the fall of the Soviet Union in 1991, the phrase became widespread as a reference to Russian information-warfare tactics. Its use subsequently became widespread in Russia to criticize any form of U.S.

But we’re still growing at quite a fast rate and still investing very heavily in future growth...In many regards we’re still growing at startup-like rates and investing at startup-like rates...

It's interesting, but I really do worry about F. It's been on a pretty brutal downtrend for so long. So much depends on their EV strategy.. I forgot which analyst/group did this, but they came out a week ago and said that Ford's EV strategy is trash basically.

Don't know if it was a hit piece or what, but I know very very little about autos and the industry in general. The main reason these have printed was because F was just at a hilariously low price after march. I'm considering selling if it hits $12, just because I don't know what their future holds

Ever hear that phrase "quit while you're ahead"?  Yeah, fuck that.  It's what quitters do.

Here's what I recommend...

If your source of income comes from working, you should be dedicating a portion of your paycheck to your retirement account - and a portion to your YOLO account (...and a portion towards the essentials, like food and internet service on a phone)

As money shows up in your YOLO account, you light that fuse and pray for it to be a bottle rocket. If it explodes in your face, you wait until next payday. If it's a bottle rocket - you send 75% of those profits off to pasture (i.e. lock it up in a retirement account). The other 25% is a bonus bet you get to make, instead of having to wait for another paycheck.

You want to be playing with underlyings that are just stupid, volatile and wild. Super high IV when it's not earnings time. The ones that just make no sense, and they're swinging up and down violently every day. The more drama, the better. If you were betting on a horse, you don't want the big stud horse that everyone is betting on because the payout sucks. You want the horse that stopped in the middle of the last race to eat the shit on the ground from the horses in front of it. The one that has tourette syndrome. You want... the [Becky](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFs9jLN4siQ&ab_channel=dnasewell) version of a horse. You will have no damn clue where it's going, but it's going somewhere - and fast. It's the unexpected move.  You don't actually wait for the race to finish.  As soon as your retarded horse bolts into the lead, you sell your ticket - because it's worth a lot of money at that time.  Don't wait until the end of the race, because your horse is retarded.  He won't make it and your ticket will expire worthless.

When you buy that cheap OTM, and Becky happens to pop off while she's carrying you in Geralds bucket - you're turning that $100 into $10k. Risk $100 to make $10k? Fuck yes, all day long. Except, you can't do it with just any stock. It needs to be a Becky stock. (Can someone make me a meme of this, please?) How do you find Becky stocks? Wait for someone to post one here, and you wait for everyone to start saying "[mine](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-3e0EkvIEM&ab_channel=as0k)". When that happens, it's go time.
Large moves are usually accompanied by heavy volume

Nice logic but then everyone would win. We’re not socialists you fuck
I've been able to make $10 each night this week by flipping a call on futures whenever the RSI is oversold. Could've been $50 tonight but I sold right away. I wanna get more greedy and double down on my next trade but waiting for an entry point is 😴😴😴

Go on the Craps table. Bet on any craps. Best of luck
Don't do it, seriously a true story and literally happened 2 months ago, my marine friend got back with his ex who was with a heroin addict. Got herpes and spread it to him. She's tainted and dirty and not worth the STD she's bringing back with her.
I live in Toronto, basically the NY of Canada 

I could move out like 20 mins and get a nice 2k sq foot house for 1mill.

200k = 20% down payment

porsche cayenne gts. could get a nice 2019-2020 used for probably around 90-100k. Ill throw like 10k down and get the longest loan i can and make my own payments.
Yup. To bring in a bit of economics, the utility of waiting a year for like $100 is way fucking lower to me than just spending it now on some shit I want. Now 50% returns in a month is something I'm willing to tie up my money for
PLTR
I expect an update by end of the week 😤     <- that’s you doing all the coke u can afford
why
Does it work if you crumble it up and put it in someone’s burger? Asking for a friend.
Unfortunately we still are on easy mode. We are recovering from a historic correction, rates are at all time lows, stimulus is likely on the way, and a vaccine. The most important part imo are the rates. You aren’t getting paid to hold bonds or cash, so why not have a heavier indexed equity allocation.

Oh, you’re taking about meme stocks. Never mind, carry on.
Direct cash stimulus is through fiscal policy aka the government, e.g. the stimulus checks. This helicopter money can have risks of inflation but it does give liquidity to everyone. However another issue is the velocity of money, i.e. if people are even spending the money or putting in their bank because they’re afraid of what’s going to happen
Where's all the og wsb bois at? Idk if they roped or if they're buried by the newbies but they used to be all over the threads and now I never see em... And every "what's your moves tomorrow" hits 20k+ comments?? I'm pretty sure like 90% of the comments are hedge fund/whale bots pumping bags
sell coke
Fine, at least 10% how about that?
You know that feeling when you ate way too much fast food and the milkshake is making you naseous and just the sight of the greasy containers make you hate yourself a little bit and you hurry to throw that shit in the trash and feel way better?

Moral of the story- if PLTR green tomorrow I'm dumping it.
buy any tsla calls that expire after 12/21
They’re literally a consulting agency
What kind of corn state do you live in where you can buy a house and a porsche on 300k?

People that weigh 300+ and have cardiac problems / diabetes die. They’re positive for Covid. What killed them, the lifelong neglect of their body or a respiratory virus with a mortality rate of .25%. That estimate is also on the liberal side as well as accounting for the older generations who have a higher mortality rate yet are only ~10% of the population. Literally educate yourself

Some time ago, I stopped thinking of options as this thing that just goes up bigly or loses me money. Seems obvious, but I started reminding myself that I'm essentially paying to rent 100 shares of 'x' stock for whatever period of time. Really helped me to chill out over short movements in the stock or the market.

I’m looking for a 1DTE 4 bagger boys, what’s the move?
Fine. It’s been range bound and it hasn’t been trading with the market in general, so it’s definitely being tied to that ridiculous short interest. Looks like any recent purchases have done nothing to decrease that either. GME could possibly be doing a slow buyback. A significant stealthy buyback could allow them to absolutely gape the shorts. Who knows though. I’m just chillin’ til earnings. Mix of shares and some very stupid 12/11 calls (considering DTC is like 15 days,) but who knows.
This is why I stayed away from PLTR (only started paying attention above $20). The founders need to sell shares to create more liquidity, which can be a good thing, but it's usually perceived negatively by the market. They could also decide to raise the number of shares at any time, although that would dilute their shares as well. They also seem like the kind of company that could hit or miss an earnings estimates because their revenue is incredibly concentrated (about 150 companies are their customers), which can produce very "lumpy earnings." 

Don't think it's a bad investment overall, but the way this has been traded has created a ton of volatility. May sell some puts if I feel like it's hit bottom.
For real though ha. I need that shit quick ha ha I’m in danger (nervous laugh)

Honestly, never buy weeklies or dailies unless you are ONE HUNDRED percent  certain of a runup or have insider knowledge (don't go blurting that out) which will cause a rally. The theta burn is gross and if things go south, you're basically burning money since your options will expire worthless and nobody will buy. My saving grace so far has been that my options are out in January and March and I'm not worried as badly

Not gonna lie, I was looking into that. Buy a shitton of like 2023 leaps, sell covered calls off of them, and then keep rolling up super long term. I’m bullish in the far future (once they start producing EV’s) so it’s tempting to just throw a bunch of capital now for relatively low risk.
why doesn't China just pump PLTR for us? ruin all those shorts for wrecking the EV and now fake accounting. That would teach them all a lesson!

what reading of history makes you think the leaders (by which i assume you mean presidents/chairman) of the country are the ones that decide. Leaders represent the rulling class of their country. Should they feel their interests best served by war, they will do so. War is always good for enriching the ruling elites. United fruits, Lockheed, Haliburton, Blackwater etc.

If you want free fucking money, buy $BABA long calls rn. They’re on sale, and this shit will be irrelevant for the next 2.5 years. They make a fuckton of money. Easy gains, this scare is just shaking out the weak hands. Buy at the bottom and sell on the hype, you’ll never lose.

Ask her if she knows her cycle. If she’s set to ovulate within the next 1 to 5 days, she should take the pill. Generally ovulation occurs about 14 days before the start of the period. It varies from person to person though. If you’re well out of that range (she’s about to start her period, or she just began it) you’re once again much more likely to be in the clear.

Agreed, and likely even more based on the fact that I'm sure many of us have told others around us about this stock. Anecdotally I know a couple people who bought gme recently and have over 1000 shares combined. I'm sure there are many more instances like that

Y’all are just not realizing that these valuations are crazy. Like with NIO.. OK they beat expectations, great, but those expectations were looooowww. NIO was like the 4th highest valued car company in the world.

I just wish I had gotten into stocks sooner than March. I was always interested in the stock market, even when I was a little runt, but I procrastinated because I felt I never had enough capital to actually make any moves. 

Then I find this sub and realize how wrong I was. Spent weeks gorging myself on every bit of knowledge and information I could get my hands on, and have since made some really good trades. But I know I would be doing 100x better if I had gotten started sooner, and knew all this garbage long before March.

The last 8 recessions (since 1970, including this coronavirus recession) has been indicated by the yield curve inverting. Currently, the (2 /10) year yield curve is getting steeper, which means AT LEAST 1-2 years of no crash.
Yes, it's in line with most other developed countries. The defense budget is massive because the US has a fucking insane GDP (it's bigger than all EU nations + Britain combined).

Same age and same position as you. If you can throw any more than 10k on a yolo you have a gambling addiction or you're about to develop one. You'll always reach for that next big yolo play to get you to 100k, then 200k, then 500k, and before you know you're at a nice 99.98% loss. Stop yourself while you're ahead.

I allocate 10% of my portfolio to yolo, individual yolo plays range 1% - 2%. With the yolo's spread out and each winner normally being anywhere from 200%-700% gain (most of the time leap options or 1-3 month otm options) the winners more than cancel out the losers. This has worked well for me for the past 3 months.

This actually makes me more nervous, if the ownership is split into a wall of users, it only requires a chink in the wall for the dam to burst. Hence I'm beginning to feel that there will be an exodus when the share price hits 50, at which point the bid ask spread will narrow and cut the price off. We should create an LLC, put one person in charge, and hand out returns to the members in this sub according to their holdings. That way we can stay strong when the price rises.

No. Those swimmers would not have died. Swimmers can live up to a few days in the reproductive tract under good conditions. Swimmers can live for an hour or two outside the body assuming they don’t dry up, get too cold, or come in contact with harmful chemicals. So if you were careful and wiped down your 🍆 after busting a nut, and took a piss, you’re in the clear. If you didn’t do those things, you left some swimmers up there. Not a ton, and obviously the odds are much lower than if you’d full on came inside of her, but there’s still odds.
I'm just going to take his advice with a grain of salt
Unless you have pre existing health conditions or overweight it’s not bad. Idiot.

Even if that is the case, all of the existing car companies are already producing EVs and will get a portion of the market. TSLA having a larger marketcap then every auto manufacturer combined, and selling the least cars... like how do you argue the company isn’t overvalued, sure it might keep running up cause it’s in a bubble. If you are looking to buy a car company would you pay 500 billion dollars for the TSLA company if you had it, or would you buy every auto manufacturer in the world for like 400b instead?

Plenty of room for tesla and LIDAR in the automation sector. I really like LIDAR because it gives you transportation tech exposure without the ridiculous EV hype bubble price tag.

Can't believe I have to say this, this is a hold long term for several reasons:

1. PLTR is helping with the Colombian Government on their Covid-19 response.

2. PLTR will be assisting the UK Government with Brexit and border control in 2021.

3. The UK Government will begin mass vaccination roll out next week to it's population of 70 million people, who is assisting? PLTR

4. The US Government have operation warpspeed coming to fruition, whose involved heavily, PLTR.

The PDF is titled 2018, dated April 2020.

Their website specifically names companies, with an updated date of July 2020. I think they aren't in clear.

That being said, I believe all of this will work itself out before the 3 years is up. Just a matter of being careful about panic sellers and making sure we all have the right info, and not misunderstood information.

Like I originally said, if I'm wrong, I want to know it, too.
I feel like this is on the opposite end of the spectrum of retard. Sure, they're right you shouldn't take out student loan money so you can yolo it on 0DTE OTM calls on meme stocks that you haven't even googled once. That's retarded. 

You know what else is retarded? Pretending like playing the safe strategies and researching everything to death is going to somehow give you an edge and never lose money.

Q7. May I repay a coronavirus-related distribution?
A7. In general, yes, you may repay all or part of the amount of a coronavirus-related distribution to an eligible retirement plan, provided that you complete the repayment within three years after the date that the distribution was received. If you repay a coronavirus-related distribution, the distribution will be treated as though it were repaid in a direct trustee-to-trustee transfer so that you do not owe federal income tax on the distribution.

(Right now you owe the IRS 30k for the distribution and you owe your 401k 100k. Unwind that. Then you’ll only owe the IRS 30% of your winnings.)
The US spends 3.2% of it's GDP on defense. That is quite reasonable.

Yeah, you don’t really know what you’re talking about. Trump has desperately tried to wag the finger at China for his shitty pandemic response. Originally, he used China to rile up his base with tough talk and 19th century trade theory. All the while, not a peep on real issues like IP theft, uigher concentration camps, or domination of Hong Kong. 

Biden has stated multiple times that there will be a different approach to Chinese diplomacy, but there are many issues that must be addressed before we move out of adversarial positions. Just because joe Biden doesn’t say dumb shit that sounds tough on Twitter doesn’t mean there isn’t a game plan to address real issues.
Over 90 years of experience so far, including a war in there.

aa comeon.. :( Let's be fair.
That is actually excellent advice.
He's also got an incentive for the tariffs to stay. The underling issue of IT theft is still there and if he lifts the tariffs it sends a bad message to US companies that he doesn't give a shit and he just wants daddy Xi to fuck continental US right in the ass.

They still work at a loss but have exclusive partnerships with 8 ish teams and also coronavirus has screwed them over. It’s a 1.5 y/o stock so pretty young, but is up to 50 from ~10. Like weed, it will go up heavily when fully legalized and more profits, like the 10M people that will be legalized to gamble on DKNG by EOY
Their offense is just a paper tiger. The only jets that work are slapped and glue'd together with old soviet tech to flex for propaganda. They can't produce jet engines themselves and their full-Chinese produced jets fall outta the sky. Their military engineering is so behind they even built a freaking ramp on their aircraft carrier, cause they can't design the catapults that we've had for decades. They can't project power with their baby navy either. 

The only thing china has going for them is their hypersonic SAMs, anti-ship missiles and their national underground missile network that houses it all. We need to remember that 100 years ago, while America was gearing up its manufacturing and learning all this tech leading up to and after the WW's, China was getting slaughtered and enslaved by the Japanese. Also, historically and culturally China's always held the idea that a good defense is better than a good offense.
I’m a long term bear on this market and I believe it will crash at some point, but come on. Bears have been getting massacred for the past 9 months, and there is no way the fed is letting this market crash in the near future. Might as well ride momentum
Bounces aren't fake. News cycle is the problem. Once it moves on to bashing something else then BABA goes right back to 300.

Won't contain the beast much longer.
I just hope it goes up in a steady sustainable manner and not 40% in 2 days then tank to oblivion.

FWIW Dish is shit as a customer to sell too. We loaned them gear for their IT solution and were an early company and didn't have all the correct paper work in place. They 1) Didn't pay us. 2) ghosted us and wouldn't return our calls/emails when they were supposed to return the gear 3) Called us for IT help for the gear they stole when they were already out of contract. 4) Finally let us get our gear back, we had to pay shipping. Die Boomer trash die.
You watch that whore mouth of yours before I stick my thang in there. CHINA + BIDEN = ME + YOUR MOM. It’s a dream combo. This is not an opinion, it’s a fact. Biden has stated many times that he wants to work with China and be buddy buddy with them.
I’m sure they’ll be priced in accordance to mooning

Man is she going to be angry when she wakes up.
BABA is free money for the patient retard. We might dump a bit at open if retail investors read about the vote passing, will be excellent buying opportunity. Buy shares or if you want options play go for atleast feb, march if you aren't very risk tolerant.

Emphasis on TIG OLE BITTIES
 Buy more at 10 usd
Someone else said wendy's baconator and I'm tired as fuck and wendies is publicly traded. Hypothetically, WEN is at a market cap of 4.87B and aside from the fact that us buying wendies at a huge volume over a couple of days would absolutely fuck our prospects of owning this thing, I think if we bought and held over a year, that might be more realistic. Just a hypothetical

And these people can't fathom another country being better or on par with somethings in US.
Start saying all sort of things like "proganda", "authoritarianism".. like what does that have to do with tech.
Tell you a secret, morning is the worst time to buy. You get the biggest swings in the morning, therefore the highest volatility, therefore options are more expensive than usual.

Buy shortly before close when you see a nice dip. Morning is the best for selling.

no, im going to guess it was the comment about martial tradition that misled you right? China today, is not the the China of history.

I have the 1/15 and 2/18 50c but u want short term gains so that’s more risk. Reality is 1/15 50c is better value and higher chance for gains. I see 65-70 by EOY. 100 in summer when COVID over and more states legalize. 10M people will be legalized by EOY.

Due diligence would have shown that the companies have ample time to make the required changes so they aren’t delisted. If you’re buying shares then this is perfect because even if they were at risk then once the changes were completed they would skyrocket.

Trickle down was just an excuse for Reagan to lower taxes for his cronies. Corporations will always pay their employees as little as they think they can get away with.
Oh god i hope you’re joking about this
I used to live in NYC (before uber), Chicago, and now(this year) in Bay Area.  When I was living in NYC, I would cab everywhere.  When I was living in Chicago, I would uber everywhere (I have taken maybe around 4-5K uber/lyft rides in 8 years).  Most people don't have cars in cities like NYC/Chicago and public transportation smell like shit which makes uber more necessary.  In California, you kind of just drive your own car everywhere and only use uber to go to airport or to go out to party at night.

yes hands down any day of the week, USA beats China in War. it takes more than tanks and a large population to win a war. Martial tradition is also important. America wasn't all-in on vietnam. vietnam didn't threaten american hegemony over the world, china does. a unified America is unbeatable. Retards may run the military right now because there's relative peace and USA is content with just bullying poor countries and taking their resources, but when it comes time to pull the trigger on China, my money is on USA...hell, all our moneys are on team USA.
Thank you so very for the detailed response!

It's amusing that, other than industry/product, you gave the same exact caveats I used to give people 20+ years ago.

It makes sense though. Salespeople are definitely a type and dangling the carrot has always been the best way to draw them into the grinder. I'm guessing that most of those entry positions also have a ridiculous turnover ratio because it's a meat market and they just churn through the expendable monkeys.

I don't want to bore you with a stream of consciousness but, I love how serendipitous reddit can be. I was randomly scrolling WSB, recognized the Sin Bin and am now contemplating changing careers again.

I sincerely appreciate your input and incite. It gives me a much more focused starting point.

I would like to ask one more question. In my prior experience, I have witnessed companies taking their top sales people and rapidly moving them "up" into management rolls. I've found that it is extremely rare for people who possess strong sales skills also possess managment skills.

Management seems to believe that killer salespeople can just teach others to do what they do. This is rarely the case and what happens is that you end up losing a top producer and gaining a substandard manager. Also, his compensation is now based, not on his drive, ambition and work ethic but, rather on his teams performance.

So, finally my question, does this scenario remain prevalent within the realm of SaaS sales or is career path mobility a bit more linear.
The Illuminati would very much like to be excluded from this narrative
Greed. Is. Good.

Hope is for losers.

Lol, well, I will say I did this because I just can't give a fuck. I'm 23 with no college education and the industry I worked in, live events and production, will be shut down for who-the fuck-knows-how-long. So I said fuck it, let's make these unemployment checks work. You're right though, I need to look to long term, safe investments( and stop looking at this sub) if this is what I'm going to do with this little capital. I'll take the L as a lesson not to be forgotten.

TYPING IN RATIONAL SENTENCES DOESNT MAKE YOU UN-FALL FOR A SHITPOST
I’m not either.  I’m mostly playing sentiment, not fundamentals.  But I am at least confident enough in the sentiment on most of these that I know there will be periods of upside if I have enough time to wait it out.
McArthur wanted to turn Mao's zerg rush into dust but they fired him so it never happened. No matter how much one hates red china, it's good that it never went through since nukes wouldn't be seen as a last resort, which would be preeeeeeety bad for humanity as a whole.

Currency in euros
FREQ
For military equipments I feel like it's justifiable though. It's not like the Chinese can just buy production licenses for F22s and C17s even if they want to. And when it comes down to equipments that matters to national security, who cares if your equipments look like the US's as long as they do their jobs. Plus it's not like China is the only one that reverse engineer military equipments to develop its own.
Hey dumbass. First off let’s try and consider what currency they use over there and how that might translate to freedom bills
People pump and dump before earnings... good or bad. NIO dropped 14% in 48 hours... CRM had done 8%. (Sorry this is the most recent reference I can think of)
Bzzz bzzz time to go to the honey pot
Agreed, both NOC and LMT look appealing. HII does too especially given how much it smashed earnings last quarter, I need to look into why it wasn’t rewarded. LHX if you’re feeling frisky and it’s defense-cut-proof. Love me some defense stocks

The "Buffett indicator" compares the total value of the stock market to quarterly GDP, gauging whether it's overvalued, or undervalued, relative to the size of the economy.

The ratio climbed past 180% on Tuesday, not far off its 187% peak in the second quarter

Buffett praised the gauge as "probably the best single measure of where valuations stand" and called it a "very strong warning signal" of an upcoming market crash.

I’d say it’s probably bad practice to just follow what some guy who got lucky once does. I mean yeah he had a great idea that one time, but it doesn’t necessarily mean he’s right every time.
Already bet my entire account on this.  These are brilliant DD’s.  I will be sending them to my girlfriend’s boyfriend who works at Goldman Sachs.
I'd assume with nearly 40,000 active users during trading hours and probably 10 active mods for the day shift and 10 for night it's probably easier to manage that way
Yeah, but still good luck mate

Me please!!! DADDY THIEL WILL COME THRU FOR YOU!!!
the way I see it, it's a good way to monetize the shares you already own with little risk. if the price of the underlying really does tank in value, it would behoove you to close out your position and try with another stock. like the guy above me said, PLTR would be a good one to try out on. idk how far its gonna tank before settling but i'd like to get back in when it is <$20
VIX / VVIX to SPX correlation is climbing to levels last seen in June,September and October

VIX not breaking 20 is alarming and up 2% on the day. At ATH for SPY, VIX should be close to ATL, but nope. Too much uncertainty

Musk said shares were overvalued at what, $400 presplit? We’re at 3k now, and nothing has fundamentally changed in the company other then more buyers for the stock. It looks like a bubble, It floats like a bubble, only a matter of time before it pops like one.

not sure how i feel about playing oil, tbh. but worth keeping an eye on for learning purposes. ive been watching OEG in the clean energy sector, missed a pop on it and waiting to see if it begins to show signs of life. think they're massively undervalued but not enough good PR lately and then clean energy getting smacked lately is really doing them no favors.

1500 GME shares already since $12 holding long lol
I studied stocks/economics/macro for 3-4 years and read/watched/listened to everything I could on options for 6-12 months before getting a HANG of what is going on, and the more ive learned the more I realize I know jack shit.


I find it hilarious how many dumb kids there are here that think its so easy to make money on options or stocks for that matter.


But its also sad cause all of you are giving away money and providing liquidity for the smart people advertising commission free gambling, stonks go up!!

Tried explaining to Mom that stonks are the best but she said while all of us are losing our money, she'd rather preserve wealth by going mostly cash gang. She sleeps better than us at night!

Stupid strong winds in California again tonight out of nowhere. Gonna knock down trees
Got a couple 1/15/21 30C PLTR today thinking it was the bottom 🤡
Yeah I’m really just speaking to the retards from my own limited experience.  I started in weeklies and monthlies back in July, had a great month or two then got wiped out like 50% down in Sept.  Since then, I buy only 2-3 months out or LEAPS, made up all my losses and it’s been much less stressful on red days.  You bleed out instead of hemorrhaging and when it’s over you still have enough time to expiry to ride the momentum back up and get most/all your money back and then some.
Thoughts on FUBO?

Seriously though PLTR will have one or two 10%+ days soon and people will jump back on thinking its going to moon again but then it will crash even harder than it is now
So I have a lot of shares long term (that and Xpeng are my my biggest long holds) but I’m also swinging it for earnings/this year with Biden and chinas clean energy plan. I have a March 110c call, January 95c call, and have 50 shares. Looking to buy one leap tomorrow too

**Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act**

This bill requires certain issuers of securities to establish that they are not owned or controlled by a foreign government. Specifically, an issuer must make this certification if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is unable to audit specified reports because the issuer has retained a foreign public accounting firm not subject to inspection by the board. Furthermore, if the board is unable to inspect the issuer's public accounting firm for three consecutive years, the issuer's securities are banned from trade on a national exchange or through other methods.

Foreign issuers of securities that use such a firm to prepare an audit report must disclose for each non-inspection year

* the percentage of shares owned by governmental entities where the issuer is incorporated,
* whether these governmental entities have a controlling financial interest,
* information related to any board members who are officials of the Chinese Communist Party, and
* whether the articles of incorporation of the issuer contain any charter of the Chinese Communist Party.

Makes you wonder at the pseudo conspiracy theory that the Occupy Wall Street movement got co-opted by the big banks and mega corporations and twisted into modern social justice.

Instead of people being unified against the rich and corrupt we all fight each other over pronouns and privilege etc instead. Much easier for those companies to wave a rainbow flag than to actually pay for their corruption.

Confused why you’re buying shares? Are you looking for a LT investment or are you trying to make quick tendies like the rest of us?

I see so many posts where people buy shares and I’m confused why they’re even in this community.

Ban
commenting so i can return to this.
Tesla is a technology company miles ahead of the competition, a lot more than cars going on.
VIX and VXX are awfully low but when VIX gets low like this it can stick here for quite a while. It can get frustrating if you use this as an indicator since every week can make it feel like the odds of a volatility spike are increasing, but it can still be many weeks away. I'm selling deep volatility put spreads to avoid timing the spike since I think the odds of a strong volatility dump is low but selling put spreads renders you immune to the general market dump if it ever happens.

Shut the fuck up about PLTR already

So as a noob how did he make such a return ? I looked on their stocks and it never went super super low and it’s not super super high can someone explain?
I think 50% profit is not a bad time to buy back. Sell some OTM weeklies or monthlies instead as the IV is higher than the LEAP
Cuz it’s gonna moon soon cuh

DXY likes to bounce that ass so I’m sure it will spike back up into the $92 but she dead after that.

dont trade options if you dont know your shit.
Why’s no one talking about GME anymore
Dont forget the motor sports industries. The atv go kart and dirt bike industry has been taken over by crappy chineese brands that people keep buying because cheap.
It does say that 97% of the estimate is based solely on auto sales. So your take checks out that fidelity is retarded and doesn’t realize the other things they have like battery tech etc.
Wow this company did 4.5 billion in revenue last year, super low P/S ratio for the industry and really good YOY revenue growth, and the market cap is only 2.8 billion?

How the hell is this thing so cheap lmao

This looks like a really good long term hold.

I'm thinking about buying some options tomorrow. What strikes & dates are you buying?

You also buying shares?
The Chinese are too smart for that. In this day and age nobody gonna win large scale wars, since 300 nukes can send the world into a nuclear winter. Let’s all chill out and keep making tendies and try not to destroy the human race

Keep up the good work sir.
Rimac is an ugly ass car tbh for that class of car. Everything about it is ratchet: it’s a Walmart version of TSLA that looks like a bootleg mclaren

I bought those NIO 48c monday for 4.05
Serious question when was the last time there wasn’t tons of signals suggesting a pullback? I’ve seen them pretty much since we magically started recovering in March.
Lmao the type of ppl to be happy with 1% port growth 🤣
i did not, just read about it tho, seems like a terrible business decision on google’s part
In your

Haven’t bought any PLTR until today. 23c 12/4.

Also, they have to use old soviet jet engines, because the one's they've created don't work. When they do work, they still break mid-flight causing the jet to fall outta the sky. 

Honestly, it's mostly in the chemical/material engineering. The west, USA specifically, is more than a couple decades ahead in this field. They can reverse engineer all the mechanical/electrical (physics-based concepts) but when it gets to the nitty gritty of the specific chemical make-ups and the procedures to make them is where they fail.
So make a good post you lazy fuck.

Now that you put it this way, the current stock price is peanuts compared to what it can be. Calls it is!! PLTR to the moon!

Sell at 64.50$ I bet it jumps Friday.  Then ps5s all around
They barely sell any cars lmfao, what, theyre an Energy company too cause they have solar panels on their website? They talk about a bunch of shit but all they do is sell cars, and not many of them

Anyone else hate PLTR now?
oh my god i just choked on my spit
TSLA roadster ever heard of it?
Pltr is holding the left attacked them as fucking trumpies a pump and dump I've never sucked a butt hole. But I would pay to suck this dumper. It's ours not theirs and that's why they are pissed.  All in at 20 this is our stock the stock for the people and I'm right

I know how it feels though I lost $3000 in October and just got back in the green in November, hoping to stay there from here on out. At one point I was down $6.5k, so I’m just happy to be where i am
knowing what a company does doesnt make buying weeklies any better of a decision
Your soul is gross.

Also, username does not check out.
wow he made 12k, he should take profits
Feel ya. My old acct got permanently banned then new acct couldn't post for 1 month. First day back, posted, then ban for 3 days.

What tax bracket are you in?
Saved! And you had me at Mac Miller and Bourbon
You chose a call with less extrinsic value on it due to it being deeper in the money (lower strike price that the stock has already surpassed) 

A more realistic price would be closer to the intrinsic value the call has: $7.79 - $1.50 = $6.29 

I’d say a realistic price for that call is probably around $6.29-$6.59

Also you need to look at if buying a call is even worth it. Personally in that position if you’re going to spend almost as much as it cost to buy a 100 shares to buy the call then most likely you’d be better off purchasing the shares.

The reason you’re seeing inaccurate pricing is 1. Option pricing doesn’t update or reflect as accurate of a bid/ask in market hours. 2. The option your looking at is much less liquid as there is 0 open interest on it which is something you don’t want to deal with if you aren’t looking to take assignment as the less liquidity means you have more expense in slippage when trying to sell the position.
I think the lesson of not fucking putting all my money into meme stocks has finally sunk in. Back to break-even I go, see y'all after months of theta gang -_-
39,999.
Yea but that 908B didnt even include stimmy checks. Which is super disappointing. We did a program here to give out food that was bought using fed grant money and the car lines were so long we had to get police to help coordinate. The money ran out last month. People missing rent and stuff too

It will make the D’s look really bad if they had a 1.8T offer on the table and then accepted half with no stimmy checks. Even the progressives were saying take that 1.8T deal. I can’t imagine the base staying quiet. Even saying ‘we’ll add more later’ like what’s been hinted at isn’t enough, people needed that money months ago and the damage is permanent
could be 50% or 0% with the context you have provided

Shut up itchy scalp, I was joking.
My best advice is don't play with money you absolutely can't 100 percent lose.  If you go tits up on a play and can't shake it off my next pay day, you shouldn't be investing yet.  That said, going all in on one company with your savings all at once isn't the move.  Find some solid companies in different sectors and add a little every pay check.  Time in market will beat timing the market.
Fine, we \*will\* no longer have that crucial safety net after December

The bulk of CSIQ's manufacturing is based in China. They have a very small manufacturing facility in Canada to take advantage of some local government incentives. The executive team is almost all Chinese origin. That in itself is not a problem at all. But if I have to invest in a Chinese solar company I'd rather pick Jinko Solar than CSIQ
You’re supposed to delete the app after the money goes down. That way it doesn’t count.
I see. Still not sure where the meme name came from other than it literally just having the word Elon in it, but it definitely could hit $600. I’m officially way too scared to keep putting money in it. I put my last little bit in at $400 and even then I was nervous.

This is where some people are speculating things will go with the 'FedCoin' digital asset they're talking about.

Take a look at how massive the company is. Take a look at the history of the stock. That shit stays locked in the 35-42ish range no matter what. Even the quickest glance should have told you this shit wasn’t going to 55
Why do u think so??@
Thanks for the intel 👍🏼

Added to my options watch list.
for sure. I bought a shit ton of SNOW, PLTR, NIO at IPO and they've made mad gainz.
Number 1 misconception. They sold those contracts. Why do they have to “panic and force the price down” when they can simply buy the shares and force it up to earn greater profits? You retards need to stfu with false hope and delusions

There are multiple approval levels for options with all broker. With top most approval you can sell naked calls and puts.  Its risky, so brokers want to know that you know ins and outs of trading before yoh indulge in naked options.

The reason why someone would do naked options? Say you have 10k in your account plus 10k in margin. Now you bought some meme stocks worth 10k because everyone is buying. Now you decided to sell puts on apple with strike $100. 

If you are not allowed to sell naked puts, you are using your margin as collateral and paying interest on that margin. On the other hand, if you are allowed to sell naked puts, you dont have to use your margin until apple falls below 100 and you are assigned those shares.  

There could be multiple such scenarios.
Time doesn’t mean shit though when you only buy at the top. Especially with calls. Then time is your worst enemy lmao

But in general I agree
[deleted]
No. You missed the play. If you buy tomorrow with all the other retards you’ll be posting loss porn next week. It hit $46 in 2018. We are sitting at 52w highs currently. That leaves $4-$6 MAX if this gets pumped to the fkn moon. Just stay on the sidelines for this one chief.

“Read for crying out loud” . I can’t read
I got a feeling tomorrow is the day PLTR bros...the day it goes back under $20 🤑
Nope. It would be about a ~30% tax if the gain was shorter than a year. If it was held longer than a year, it is taxed at about 15%. So he needs to plan for $3K in taxes to Uncle Sam. 

We pay the government to spend our money insanely inefficiently. But our tax bills are just blank checks to fund whatever the government decides to pursue that week. The Democrats insist on government intervention every step of the way which is expensive, but they just pass a tax hike. Biden plans to tax all gains (including holdings of longer than a year) at 30%. It’s easy to pass the bill when the people proposing it are the same people who build their wealth from government salary (our taxes) instead of through stocks like everyone else.
But then he suddenly awoke, saw he was flat broke, and wishes he were dead
There was no digging required to figure this out, Burry himself literally tweeted this a few days ago....(he probably deleted it by now)
It’ll just go up man. The fire has been lit, and the people are dumb enough to follow anyone who speaks their tune and is charismatic about it
HAHAHAH
It’s just weird how much gain porn and loss porn is being posted all of the sudden, not to mention bots in the daily thread upvoting any comment with pltr

Idk this seems bigger than the usual meme stocks
What's valuation? 

People said the same thing about AMD and NVDA, yet they are full of surprises

think you're right.

some other idiots here are suggesting TSLA picks up FCAU. I could see it, honestly. As a jeep owner i'd love to see some innovation come to the jeep brand. trash fuel economy, aging interior design, shoddy engineering under the hood (who the fuck puts an A/C hose above fuel injectors?). Tesla could certainly modernize Jeep, as well as bringing a lot of luxury value to Fiat and Maserati, and even a big Dodge overhaul.
Kinda wish I had that Skyrim feature where I can fast forward in time 15 mins and see what the euros do, these futures are boring
No problem doing it yourself if you want to risk it. I just can't imagine telling others to do it.
I don’t think I could name a well performing stock with a “reasonable valuation”
I love what they've done with the recovery stocks. They buy a shitload of them pre market, retail FOMOs in, then they just dump the very same stocks the following day. Repeat randomly + once per vaccine news pump

CRM is awesome stock. I honestly love it. They are killing it in Europe, literally hairdresser saloons integrate Salesforce.

Yes, they are not going to explode, but it is a stable and reliable stock for mid and long term hold. They will be back to 260 by the end of the month and reach new ATH by next earnings report.
It more than doubled this year.

Yo, I built my PC to play PUBG, then Chinese hackers ruined it by making money selling the loot from the crates they won cheating, and selling the cheats as well.

And I also do stand up comedy, for about 4.5 years now. And guess what, some Chinese guy sucks a bats dick (as well as his entire body, for food purposes) and then gets sick with coronavirus and now I can't do stand up comedy either!

China needs to stop fucking with my shit.

Never mind.. Looked up again. They have 3 yrs to comply to being audited. For the sake of baba and Nio, I hope the algos don't read the news like I did
PLTR Weekly holders are indeed probably fucked. But if you bought shares you’re straight up cruising right now.
Considering how retail brokerages like RH finance their line of credit from financial institutions WITH that yolo/margin -

I will not be the first to say what should or shouldn’t be allowed. But it might be the singularity should we achieve it - the true end game of a free market under capitalism. Wealth in all directions for all parties with only a couple ways it could fail!
**Holding Foreign Companies Accountable Act**

This bill requires certain issuers of securities to establish that they are not owned or controlled by a foreign government. Specifically, an issuer must make this certification if the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board is unable to audit specified reports because the issuer has retained a foreign public accounting firm not subject to inspection by the board. Furthermore, if the board is unable to inspect the issuer's public accounting firm for three consecutive years, the issuer's securities are banned from trade on a national exchange or through other methods.

Foreign issuers of securities that use such a firm to prepare an audit report must disclose for each non-inspection year

* the percentage of shares owned by governmental entities where the issuer is incorporated,
* whether these governmental entities have a controlling financial interest,
* information related to any board members who are officials of the Chinese Communist Party, and
* whether the articles of incorporation of the issuer contain any charter of the Chinese Communist Party.

I thought foreign but one thought of Japan where they already figured hydrogen out but we gave them the finger instead of using it.
It be like that
>Maybe because you call it gambling? That can't help you mindset wise... I would NEVER call it gambling. Options are used for me on every account now. I don't get why you would trade option if you feel it's gambling

I guess it all depends on how you look at it but I very much look at investments as a form of gambling. The more risk involved (and presumedly the bigger the reward) the more of a gamble I feel I am taking. I think most people who invest on a regular basis see it as some sort of form of gambling. Especially something with as many unknown variables and inherent risk as options trading. After all gambling's definition is - *the wagering of money or something of value on an event with an uncertain outcome, with the primary intent of winning money or material goods.* It is hard to argue that investing doesn't fall under that definition (unless of course, you're certain of all the outcomes and have a 100% win rate).

I guess it's all semantics but viewing it as gambling helps me realize that there are very real risks involved, to never get complacent, and to do as much work and research possible to reduce those risks. Again, I guess it all depends on how you look at it but personally, I think looking at investments as something with no gamble and only predictable outcomes is a MUCH more dangerous mindset to have.

BREAKING: GameStop has announced a partnership with Chinese EV producer Nio for a new generation of electric vehicles, with optimized software provided by Palantir. The three are expected to merge as soon as early next year, consolidating into a single holding company with ticker symbol $MOON.
Us hasn’t blocked internet or even TikTok yet, while China has banned most western shit. Fake news and disinformation campaigns (from China) is only rampant because the US doesn’t have only state sponsored propaganda like China. China literally has an authoritarian regime where you can’t even make fun of the president as Winnie the Pooh without being thrown into an execution van, disappeared and re-educated, or put into a concentration camp to have your organs harvested. Lol US presidents aren’t authoritarian when over half the country can openly talk shit on them and it’s encouraged by media...

It can be your best friend when you don’t know what you’re doing.  Time.  It gives you a chance to be right about a strike price.  Time.  It gives you more opportunities to exit your position if things start going badly.  TLDR:  stop buying fucking weeklies retard, set a few long dated expirations and still enjoy 100-300% returns that are far less risky than that PLTR eow spread you just dumped your life savings on hoping for a 1000% that was never going to happen anyway.

Any respectable MM that sold contracts would delta hedge with shares. Price got pumped and dumped, and all those OTM calls with ridiculous IV had to be unwound.

PLTR is a good company, but if you told us at IPO that we would hit $20 within a year, we would've been ecstatic. It stagnated for a month, and then tripled in the next when it became a MEME.

Yes price action on the spreads has been insane. Premiums are high too - not for those of us not willing to take some significant risk for a major print. And if they do print, it will be an all timer. Cheers bud
Too expensive.

Idk why everyone isn’t doing MFA calls
Tell em that you’re COVID negative but you tested positive for vaginitis
Knowing that stock, you might just have to wait 5 days for a turnaround.
Sell OTM calls at your purchase price 3-6 weeks out, if it goes up you can get out, if not you inch your way back up
I think ACB could be at $9 price target if all goes well. (Vote fails) But depending on your time frame and risk tolerance you’d have to pick a strike. wouldnt go lower than $5. Also usually lots of volume on the flat numbers if that makes sense. For example, $5, $10, $15 strikes
Bought calls at 18 and sold at 28 😎

Then I promptly lost my gains by buying NIO calls 😎

PLTR is a trash boomer stock that never had any profit in the 12 years of running. MS Excel can handle all the data manipulation PLTR claim to do.
I see a reversal, but no mooning.

Problem with some retards here is that they think you're supposed to buy calls after something moons and then buy puts after something drills.

Best day to buy a call is when something is flat/red and the best day to buy a put is toward the end of an extended runup.

You're all retarded. Covid is "a cold" for 98.5% of people. The people who need the vaccine will have it within 6 weeks.
Yes I wrote the wrong ticker lol
Excited for Airbnb soon.
Not sure why all the downvotes. They knew this worked several months ago. It is exactly what parts of Asia did. Total lockdown for 14 days. Then take temps, wear masks, get tested. If resurges, 14 more days. It completely stopped the outbreak and now they’re at concerts while we are 6 months from any semblance of normalcy. 

So imagine in May everyone stayed home for 2 weeks. Rona disappears. Comes back in July. 2 more weeks. That’s 4 weeks of nothing and every other day is somewhat normal. We have the worst possible solution happening here.

Hey man, just wanted to let you know this was a very good explanation of more complex options topics. You should look into maybe turning this into a series or website, I think you’re very good at explaining this stuff in a way people unfamiliar with options can understand, I’d assume this translates to other securities topics haha.

I personally went APHA because of the interest. It’s the most profitable and most likely long term stock. Idk why i did that buttt. I’ve had trouble liquidating ACB options before, but if thats not an issue anymore than I would go there. I have APHA $6 puts 1/15/21 exp. Took a couple extra weeks in case stock reacts inversely to bad news.
yes pls
It’s still a attractive buy at this price base on the fact all  common share owner will get warrant post merger

i would never tell my fam to invest in something im personally not invested in............ PLTR 40c baby
How long you been on this sub? I joined it last week and have also definitely learned to never touch anything anyone says here if its suddenly gone up recently. I'll only maybe buy something if its been trading sideways for a while, like I heard about Blackberry here last week so I bought some and that saved me from all my other losses cause of this stupid sub, but gdamn there's some hilarious shit here.
Yep I do exactly the same thing although I've been getting riskier lately moving to 3 months out. What's your system for selecting strike prices? I usually aim for around 4x Extrinsic Value ratio on my long/shorts.
Account > 20K = account ***greater*** than 20K

Account < 20K = account ***less*** than 20K

The real question is, is it worth $2,000 to never see or speak to this guy again?
I feel this. Earlier this year during the Covid crash SQ hit $38. I bought as much as a could, i.e. a few thousand dollars worth, since it is my favorite company, and told my dad about it and told him he should get in on it. My dad knows absolutely nothing about stocks, has never bought one in his life, but he got totally hyped since he has heard me talk about SQ for a fucking year and wanted to borrow ONE MILLION DOLLARS against his house to buy it. He even spoke to his accountant and everything.

I told him that was crazy, he doesn't understand, the stock market is super volatile and anything can happen in a recession, don't fucking borrow huge amounts of money against your house to put it on a meme stock. He wanted me to buy the stock for him (he doesn't know how to do it lol) and I refused, saying it was too risky. 

Anyway now SQ has mooned and I've made like $40k profit on it, which is a lot for me. But all I ever hear about is how I lost my dad millions of dollars by talking him out of buying SQ and how he was such a genius for "recognizing the opportunity" (that I fucking told him about, he had never heard of square in his life) and how he would all be super rich if it wasn't for me....
Ok and why not

Data tracking wasn’t even a thing in 2003 when it was founded. Why do the years in business mean anything in such a rapidly changing industry?
i've seen this kind of trade but i don't understand what the point is of buying call leaps with a strike price well under the current price. Isn't it very expensive? Why not just buy at the current strike price? What's the thought process?
Belly laugh thank you

PLTR mooning boys
That’s fine in India. But in America this is how everyone lives and things work. People have jobs and get paid and that pays for our standard of living. Yes we could all shut down and rough it out for 14 days. The problem is the debt collectors don’t shut down for those 14 days. The food, electricity and water still cost money those 14 days. A ton of the businesses that shut down for lockdowns never even reopened. Look at our unemployment numbers. Things are very bad already. Nobody has money to pay bills or income if you shut down and add to that we are going to collapse. If the government plans a shut down and provides aid to cover for it (the reason we pay taxes is for this situation) we could do it.
Welcome to the club. Glad to have you aboard.

No. Buy one call and sell a higher strike call against it (ex. buy the $10 call, sell the $12 call). You cap your upside but it's way way cheaper and you're not as exposed to change in IV or time value

Share Price vs Market Cap

Why does everyone talk about share price and not market cap when talking about stocks?

I understand that they’re tied together, share price x outstanding shares = market capitalization.

But every stocks share price is different. And don’t companies make up a share price at IPO?

Why is share price the more common number to look at when other companies can have lower or higher share prices and still be more or less valuable companies?

Why don’t people just refer to market cap to put it in a better perspective?

Then instead of having to remember the share price of multiple companies I only have one metric to look at.

I mean I’m intentionally using the term “institution” vaguely, I’m referring any bank, hedge fund, firms that are slowly reducing their positions in these indices due to looming uncertainty from macro trends. The market is trending upward, but in an extremely choppy manner. There’s lots of resistance levels preventing upward movement, but as those that want to offload their positions run out of shares to sell, then buyers will start breaking the resistances more easily. DXY is almost 1 point below the September lows but SPY is barely ten points above September highs. 

And of course not all sellers are institutions, and not all buyers are retailers. But there’s been very little price action in equity indices despite the accelerating drop in the dollar.
Picking up long-term Glu Mobile calls. If you think people in this sub make bad money decisions, imagine the intersection of cringy adult Disney fans and GACHA players.

I'm more inclined to believe the market will go since a blue senate means no more McConnell blocking bills and the dems are clear to possibly spend 3 trillion lets go!!! And maybe just maybe but probably not pass 2000 dollars a month for large groups of people. But that may just be to lofty.

I literally posted what should be down. Hard lockdown for 2-3 weeks with widespread testing. Capital punishment for anybody who travels knowing they can spread the virus... only for a very brief period

You made my night bro. I’m gunna sleep like a baby. This shit could drop to $10 (it never will again) and I just fucking buy more. If it’s not delisted then it’s a 99% chance super massive win.  1% it’s only a massive win

#(っ◔◡◔)っ ♥ PLTR ♥
FIT I might fucking love...It’s at a weird point, because technically it still has some resistances to break before I’d like to get in, but there’s not a ton leading me to believe that they won’t be broken. Looks pretty good to me 

Not a bad time to tell you though, these opinions and charts are not equal. The 1 hour chart where spx won’t close about 3674 or whatever it is is not the same as the 100 year spx chart I showed you yesterday with the bottom line never being broken. 

The latter is something that could genuinely change your life depending on how long it continues to hold. Longing the bottom line of that chart is pretty high on the list of best financial opportunities you’ll have in your life should it present itself 

The 1 hr chart one is an arguable retard trying to justify his biases on reddit. Doesn’t mean I’m wrong necessarily, but they just don’t hold the same weight 

And for riot I’d say you gotta keep an eye on that eth channel. Riots chart alone I’m not incredibly bullish on, but in the context of the rest of the c rypto market there’s no way I’d recommend getting rid of that position, not yet anyways. 

PLTR honestly idk...if it can come down a little and form a more clear channel I’d have a better answer, but as it stands now there’s no way I could say. 

https://m.imgur.com/a/SvN0oik

Assuming this general structure holds I would expect to hit that top line again. But with so little info, it’s hard to be confident in that. Like that’s the perfect example of charts not being equal. This is not the same as that 100 yr chart. 

Fuck man how is it that every chart I look at I’m bullish except for SPX 😑
it won't be high cause they are "seasonally-adjusting" them now. Which means, they take about 200k off the top and tell you it went down.

Thank you so much. The one sentence made every sense to me "Holding the loss on the books >30 days" I recall studying about this many years ago.
That's not how it works with private banks selling their bonds to the Fed through. The money goes into a Fed account and they can't just spend that money however they want, it's more like a collateral account that lets them lend more money out. Which they aren't doing at the moment as they're scared they won't get it back.

This is one huge misconception with QE.

I understand. I don't see a scenario any time soon when I would sell them. I just wonder how, and more so WHY, someone would actually do it.   


I am pretty sure I'd need a few million before I even started to look into it. The concept of losing 10x your "investment", even rarely, seems like a horrible gamble unless it's part of a complicated hedge.   


My understanding is that generally big banks can do it with complicated algorithms to define how to make it a useful part of a much larger strategy. I am pretty sure JPM has done some stuff with naked options on silver.

The appearance of things (at least to me) indicates that every strategy is a loser against Covid. The only thing that would probably work are going to extreme levels of lockdown like China or basically 99.9% adherence to precautions like in places such as Japan or S. Korea. You won't get either of those in western countries, not even in Europe.

Seems like lockdowns work, but delay the next outbreak to whenever you loosen up. So you may just have to sacrifice X% of the population and go about life as close to usual as possible or you mass lockdown and try to stall for a vaccine, but this is probably too damaging.

Probably the best argument for lockdowns though are so you can space out infections to a rate that hospitals can accommodate, because once the infection rate is too high and hospitals are maxed out, death rate surely moons.

Hi,

Resident of San Francisco here. Where can you buy a home for $10k? You're lucky if that affords you a parking spot in this city.
Lmao
No DD except that Target “partnership” that should be rolling out. It’s legitimately a hit or miss. Logically, people have been at home and not going out, thus less need for makeup. But who knows maybe they surprise.
So it is simply pushing contrast that is causing the internal metal of the catheter to unravel inside the patient? 

If it is, you think folks will be OK with something that has resulted in around 15 Maude reports in November alone (my guess is these are highly unreported given the lack of reported device malfunctions since the product was released, and sudden wave of reported deaths) having literally life saving information relegated to fine print? Fine fucking print? 

Penumbra needs to do better. I think they get killed with litigation, but even if they don’t it’s going to get very messy and they will lose massive market share.

You are not being attacked it’s just something I’ve seen on multiple older BMWs that totals the car. lol imagine getting your whip totaled from the windows not rolling down.

BMW is known for not giving a fly fuck about quality assurance. The luxury and brand recognition is top notch though.
Because unless you plan for and provide people with stimulus aid to do it you can’t shut everyone down for 14 days. These half ass shut downs aren’t doing anything to stop Covid, just fucking the economy up even worse and costing people their jobs/ careers/ livelihood.

thinking i might go for those once i cash out on my tsla calls, i cant see CRSR staying this low. Rotation back into tech with lockdowns restarting would be helpful.

Is it time for the second pltr wave yet
Depends. On ACB and HEXO and Sundial yes. On Aphria, GTII, Cresco no
He did but with the gov funding bill I bet he passes it in there for some other concession
Margin is free money
That is correct. It will be the [(strike price - cost basis) x 100].
Yeah it just sucks to have to slow down because I was on a roll. If I sold PLTR at 30 I would have been up like 62% on the month and it was my first month of actually investing.
Maybe someone has the scoop, you never know
Wow good job man!

The company should have emphasized the need to avoid pushing contrast at rollout. The assumption by the IR specialists that they could treat the Jet 7 like any other aspiration catheter clearly points at a training and education gap. There's a good argument to be made that the company was negligent in failing to highlight that difference.

But neurovascular thrombus aspiration catheters ain't Ford Pintos. They're a PTFE-encased slinky that gets threaded up from your femoral artery through your internal carotid while the unfortunate party's cortical neurons are actively dying from ischemia. A lot of these cases end up with significant morbidity regardless of the interventional outcome. The burden is way more on the docs to  have read up on the indications and limitations of the device. The company might share some burden but in no way is this going to be a cratering event. 

The short seller's slide stacks ain't the whole story and the fact that the FDA approved basically the same technology for PEs last month tells me $PEN are gonna be around for a while.

Same was said about the etrade baby and retail investors ability to buy stocks thru a computer. Prior to that, people had to call their broker. On the phone. And talk to someone. Prior to that, a telegraph. And before that, in person usually at a "bucket shop".

Gamifying investing (well its always been a game, but opening it up to the general public via technology) drives fundamental disconnects, which drives value investors crazy and into making investments they normally would not make.

Did you expect them to say “fuck the reporting requirements. Fuck off SEC”?
IMO it's understandable if you're a business owner and getting completely screwed by lockdowns and stressed over it. But no way around it otherwise hospitals are going to be overwhelmed. Most people I know work healthcare related jobs and it's manageable so far but early spring was REALLY BAD for them. I can't imagine how terrible it'll get if nothing is done especially at the rate of new infections.
Like some time next year for the majority of people lol. March, earliest. 2k dying a day, even if it falls off, we chill with another minimum 50-100k dead rather than taking a 14 day time out?

I follow the steel industry very closely. I’ve noticed every time there is a spike in CWT pricing from mills and manufacturers, there is a correlating jump in US Steel stock price (haven’t followed VALE as much, but looks to be similar). 

CWT pricing is in an uptrend at the moment, lots of steel fabrication/ erection companies are putting in mass qty. orders to get material before prices jump even further.

I’d love to invest into solar, actually investing using ahem.. shares. for the long term (5+ yrs outlook) as I really believe it’ll be the thing that everyone then says “ah that’s a no brainer” but they’re all SOOO expensive right now. None of the market valuations are even close to the actual assets or earnings of the companies. As soon as they come back down to earth though I’m taking my entire $4 of liquidity and putting it into solar companies.
Peter Thiel is totally 🌈, people. And 🌈 here is 🐻 therefore puts on PLTR.
puts on boomer shit is my favorite fuck dish im in
no growth potential to support the market cap

also, this company has been around forever; what has changed? Is it because they are public and you know about them that they have more potential? better management?
2500 / 2000 = 1.25 monthly increase.
1.25^12 = (roughly) 14.552

So, it's +1355.2% in a year. If my math is correct.

I mean, it would make more sense for you to explain what you mean, first.

So the institutions, who hold most of the equity in the market, are selling? Even though indexes have been going up?

And when they finish, that will allow who to buy? Retail? And who will they be buying from?

I just legit don't understand your argument.

How long do you plan on holding onto the $240 calls?

Honestly this place was better when their were less autists. We have all sorts of pumpers, terrible shit posters, and dumb asses these days.
You retards worried about this guy converting useless shares from B to A when this cuck holds claas F shares... yeah you heard me right.. F for "fuck your voting rights".. this dude can change his voting rights on class F stocks so he never loses control of the company..

I’m not surprised that there are so many boomer investors who are bearish on Tesla long term.  But here at WSB I thought you young autists would generally understand that this company is like apple 10 years ago.  To my surprise though, a lot of you are still long term bears.  I guess that’s what I get for hanging out with a bunch of retards.

Tesla will be the largest company in the world by market cap by 2030.
> On a stock that dropped 42%, I made a profit of $1,440

Cool looking strategy but isn't the profit stupid low compared to how much time it takes and the needed (locked?) capital. The 3 given examples each show like ~12% profit over 4-8 months.

There is another dude doing quantitative historical analysis who says he has discovered "rules" for how societies rise and collapse, and his projection was the US is in for at least 10 years of severe social turmoil.

Now one of the factors was that society starts producing more elites than there are elite positions, ie people with prestigious college degrees who can't actually get equivalent jobs or really equivalent wealth, and that one of the ways the government tries to postpone unrest is by spending far more than it can sustain. Sound familiar? Asset prices are going to continue skyrocketing because there is literally nothing else the elite class can do to forestall collapse than wave monopoly money in everyone's face.

I figure, may as well ride that gravy train as far as it will go.

Just looked up his name, the guy is Turchin, he had a good podcast on the New Yorker or Atlantic or something.

In basketball, you can actually dominate with 1-2 amazing players. Thinking like Stockton/Malone here. They could have had any bozos on the court with them and still made plays.

At this point, I consider my losses the ticket price I have to pay to truly and fully enjoy the memes here.
Probably none, but maybe CSIQ since it's so undervalued. Solar was overbought af a few days ago with ENPH @ 140 and I'm not interested in it unless below 120 really. Imo, sector overvalued and Biden influence already priced in. Probably sell the news in Jan or when green energy spending fails to meet high expectations

I never thought it would disappear. I thought it would get worse - politicians love fear. That’s why they enjoy war. Fear and money. Bush loved us being afraid of WMDs and Iraqis.

This thing will literally go on for years. Every flu season will now mandate masks. Vaccines for crap we shouldn’t need to vaccinate against. If you are scared - stay inside. If you are compromised - stay inside. If you aren’t, take your own calculated risk.

Yep. Of course my state is supposedly suffering the worst right now and the hospitals my family and friends work at are directly in the hot spots. They are literally no busier than an average flu season. Buy hey, shut it all down, can never be too safe right...
What a way to waste $27 billion dollars. Bunch of losers.
Reddit only added the feature this year I think
I think you know
I agree. Worked in a hospital a few months ago. Nearly overrun most of the time, was always a struggle finding beds for admits. ER had people laying on cots in the halls because they had nowhere to admit them to.
That could work, but if it does, you will never be satisfied until you lose it all, bruh.
asking for a friend
Yes, but that doesn’t mean it won’t pop on news. It’s not in my Roth, it’s in my options play account. I’m here for gains, not to invest in boomer stocks
It doesn't work that way though. 

If you're an interventional radiologist, and you're using a device or product, it's your responsibility to understand the limitations and restrictions on using that device. If it says in the product manual not to push contrast, and you do, it's not the manufacturer's fault - it's yours. 

"But all the other aspiration catheters let me push contrast!" With all due respect, doctor - fuck you, this is the Jet 7, read the package insert. If it's in the fine print, it's on you. 

The fact that they sent out a DHCP letter in June to clarify is pretty much the icing on the case. It's debatable whether or not the company should have done a voluntary recall but you can bet it was discussed in detail with the FDA, the CEO was in on the call and took notes. 

The share price might still dip but it's not going to crater. They'll settle out the class action and have the Jet 8 out by Easter.

🌝 or ☠️
Not gonna out her cause she posts occasionally but it was pretty mid tbh
What a shitty way to lose 50 bucks
Lol
I don’t know where you are getting the Luminar at 10 stuff. That’s not how a SPAC merger works. Whatever the SPAC is on the merge day, is what the target is. So if GMHI is 40, Luminar is 40, if G is 10, LUM will be 10. Your 22.5 calls will just become LUM 22.5 calls.

The 10 stuff everyone talks about is for the SPAC investors if a deal never materialized. So if I invest $5000 into a SPAC xyz at $10 a share. It may go up to $23 and they can target Stripe. But if Stripe says no and a merger never happens after 2 years of the SPAC I’ll get my $10 a share back.
Its funny that the people who sold at 38$ would have saved so much money if they just spent 5 mins doing DD lol
Ups and fedex to the moon
Why not enough? You can start with under $2500 with PLTR right now. I decided I'm not buying options anymore thanks to what I have learned on WSB very recently. Just selling them. Most notably, have a list of stocks I would be ok with owning for a while. Wait for a big down day, like Wednesday on PLTR and sell cash secured put. Can net $165 per contract on a 12/9 call with 22 strike. If it doesn't hit you made 165 on 2200 or 7.5%. In 7 trading days. That rocks. Find similar trades for 1-7% a week (assuming you never get assigned)  and you're looking at 2x to 10x your money in a year. That is almost certainly unrealistic in reality, but it certainly has a better chance of making you rich than buying options. It may take a few years instead of some super risky YOLO that could make you rich or wipe out half your net worth in a few weeks. 


If it falls below 22, your cost basis will be 20.35. So you got a 10% discount on today's closing price. That's way better than just buying the shares outright. 

And if you are forced to buy, you immediately start selling covered calls. 


Just this week I bought 100 GME shares and sold a call a week out. BOTH positions are in the green. I only have 2500 in the account. But compound interest works wonders.

You think the other auto makers are going to release products with the same features for cheaper?  Did you not read the part about Tesla manufacturing advantage?

You really think GM or Ford are capable of catching up to Tesla to produce a car with the same specs for cheaper?!?!  Seriously?  You either don’t understand the situation or are just in serious denial.

They’ll be selling products with inferior specs at much higher prices and be taking a loss on each unit sold for a long time.

Strike price, date, option premium and implied breakeven, in the money vs out of the money, time decay, volatility, et al., All play into whether and how much money someone may gain or lose.  And yes, you only risk the premium.  If your whole brokerage account is used to play options, you could eventually lose it ALL or, in extremely rare cases, retire tremendously wealthly. It is that reckless and greedy pursuit of wealth, rather than a rigorously disciplined strategy, that makes investing in options perhaps the riskiest endeavor a retail investor can engage in.

You could straddle the $23s and it would cost about $6 to do so for the 24th, you could pay $8 and get nearly an extra month.

That said the downside is less lucrative now so maybe a ratio straddle 3 to 2 call side favored with the idea that the puts will try and end break even overall and then free roll the call side (or close to it).

You might be able to lock in enough put side profit quickly to let the call side rise up and make a very decent profit by Jan 15.

I’m so pissed I read some bullshit on this subreddit last minute either last night or this morning about how it’ll pass for certain and become an issue of becoming delisted. 

But up until that moment I was prepared to buy the dip. I even had a limit buy set for $38.70!!!!!!! For 1800 shares!!!!!!!!!

Fuck my life. It really is the truth that you have to digest and go with your own information. It’s so hard to discern what’s right or wrong sometimes. I missed out on a lot of money this week. 


Luckily I still made an extra 90 shares since Monday
Sorry that sounded more trollish than I wanted to be. I literally wish I had 180k right now.
I lost $7K this week. I made $7K last week. Money come money go

Quality DD
gab.com
yep...inferior trading experience!
DD can't "come" from anywhere. DD is a process. 

In the same way security can't come from somewhere. Security too is a process.

Most of what is labeled as "DD" is misinformation on WSB. I hope the story is someday told of the WSB-stock manipulation program where, whoever it is, robbed retail in new ways. Some of the writing (just the writing, not its contents) is just a bit too good to suggest it's not professionals doing it, which certainly makes it criminal. The "DD" often contains a combination of wrong and old market information designed to give the reader the impression that something is a sure thing. If you want to act on news, I suggest you buy Business News Wire from Warren Buffett. For most of retail, acting on news doesn't work, so all you can profitably do is hold for as long as possible in the future, because the market makers can't predict the future either (perhaps they can do it better, but they can't do it with certainty). They can however predict the next 5 minutes much better than you do, because they actually read the news of the past 5 minutes 24/7. 

The complicated part is that some days there are individuals posting that do seem to know what they are talking about, but those are the exception and not the rule and these people can also be wrong. 

Since I don't know the people writing the DD, I can't trust them, so I don't believe a word they say. And, neither should you. You can verify what they say, but if there is even a little bit of exaggeration in it, you should think and perhaps just inverse them instead. It's better to ignore it.

spent 4 days in LA three years ago; saw people fucking on the sidewalk covered by a blanket,  tents and bums everywhere, the smell of fuckin piss everywhere we went (especially downtown which seem to only be inhabited by homeless people), saw a guy throw chairs and smash a table at a 🌮 🛎 cz he paid for extra patato salad? and there’s wasn’t enough in his burrito, saw a guy standing at a street corner holding a gun just chilling, had a bum rush into the hotel lobby and snatch/contaminate the donuts for guests, saw a man almost punch a tranny on the beach cz the tranny was wearing something tranny and it just pissed off the guy, saw a one legged man go at it with the bus driver on that one fuckin bus that goes from Hollywood to Santa Monica ( 1 & 1/2 voyage but only costs a dollar and some change, better than an uber).

Basically, fuck that place, i came , i saw, i dipped my toes in the frigid pacific & i fucked off, but obviously it took 17 hours to get from LA to 🍁 cz fuck American Airlines
I was banking on Trump doing something really crazy and/or Biden triggering Trump to do something. I sold a put that day to recover some of my cost, but yeah did not go well lol

A lot of my boys are Trump supporters, and I personally would agree with some of his policies, I liked his foreign policies and some of his economic decisions but that is a completely false narrative.

The fact of the matter is the whole world is dealing with this thing, not just America, and there plenty of lockdowns in other countries. 

Australia locked down entire states for only a few cases and they barely have an issue. New Zealand took it seriously from the start and now they are in great shape. Several countries have little to no virus because they actually came together as a country, locked down when needed then continued to wear masks and take the virus seriously. 

Trump actually had an amazing opportunity to turn this virus into a slam dunk re-election, and botched it because he couldn’t bare swallowing his pride and say he was wrong. Look at any Presidents approval ratings during times of crisis, they rocket up, and trumps ratings were doing the same in late March early April, until he jumped ship and just said fuck it, basically telling the most active voter base(seniors) he doesn’t really give a fuck about their safety. 

People were also saying it would “disappear” after the election, did it? Of course it didn’t.
Because it’s racist. Obviously.

WSB is funny because we all call each other retarded for our super risky plays. Most of us are not actually retarded and understand how to give investing advice to people close to us, who may not have the same risk profile we do. Older people close to retirement certainly fit that bill. Turns out some of us are *actually* retarded, though. WSB always surprising me.

Ya but some dude here just mentioned her and it got me renminiscing
That's why this question is so silly. It takes a team.

You look at someone like Matt Ryan, and he's fucking amazing and has the stats to back it up. But, his team/coaches have fucking sucked ass, so no one gives a shit.

But, as a standalone QB, there's no reason he shouldn't be up there with the current greats.

This question will always be silly. If you have godly protection and receivers who will catch anything you throw in their general direction, how can you compare to a QB on a shit team?

Tom Brady happened to be an amazing QB for one of the best-coached/managed teams in the history of the NFL, so it's impossible to ever really compare.

If we had just a machine force sell all our shit at +40% Gainz we would be all up like 10K more than what we are now. At minimum.

We aren’t all wrong. We are just almost all retarded and greedy.

Positions?
Simple, buy an option for $100, stock moves in opposite direction or moved in the right direction but didn't hit your strike price by expiration, option is worthless at expiration, -100% return.

How do you get -99%? Stock moves in opposite direction so far away from your strike price, the option you paid $100 for easily becomes worth nothing and buyers will only pay you $1 for it, -99% return. Do this consistently enough and your entire portfolio will reflect -99%. Good luck!

Do tons of research on what your size is. Buy a used of either brand that doesn't have any rust. Take it in to the shop and do EVERYTHING the mechanic says and you'll basically have a brand new bike. I love bike mechanics. You'll go in and they'll be like "omigod, I can't believe you've destroyed this beautiful machine. She was perfect and you've ruined her soul. She needs 17 hours of work and a total overhaul. That will be $54. Also, her name is Eve and she is a Sagitarius."

Outside of wheels and the frame, bikes are amazingly cheap for the time you spend on them. Also, get a carbon fork.

Old news
I bought $4 puts on gme back in March and I profited, which was the first time I made an option play. It never felt so good to profit off of a stock going down.

That experience turned me from a greenhorn noob into a permabear idiot. I constantly thought the whole market was going to drill its way into the center of the earth... I fucked up. I really had no concept of stocks. I was just blown away at the idea of options while the market was crashing. That mentally impaired me. It feels weird buying into GME at $15  when I thought $4 was way too high. I really thought they were going to $0. 

Fucking hell, I've learned so much in this year. Just wish it didn't cost me so much.
If you send it to me, I'll spend it on more PLTR.

This is me on my drive to Wendy’s picking up an extra shift to cover the bills for this month
Naked calls mean they dont own any shares. When their premium hits 0 they also make 0$ on it. If you put your whole balance in one options play and it fails you end with 0$ or if it is an unrealistic pt it might be like .06 cents which is where the 1% comes from
Why is covid still a cause for concern when the economy is in shambles.
It must suck being this stupid. 

Copying wechat. Wow, yeah QR codes are pretty fuckin snazzy. The reason it doesn't work here is the government can't put you in a pork rending plant for fraud.

Crm calls
Timeframe. People buy ITM or Slight OTM options. After market tanks or close to expiry those call options are worth close to nothing. Those options that are worth nothing is what you are looking at in your time. Thats how people lose everything.
spy puts

vxx calls
LOLLL thanks for the laugh
“Hahaha fuck California! Now where’s the next big tech company to invest in from? Love zoom, docu, Apple, salesforce, Cisco....”
Super fake and gay
naw man not all of us want to eat an asshole. sorry.
Im up 500% on some of my pfe calls this week, and there's still a lot of meat on the bone
Oh weird I took my GMAT here. Didn’t realize that the building was significant.

Well you can buy 1 contract for 10% of your portfolio and hope to profit a couple hundred bucks. Or you can YOLO it all for 100% of your portfolio and make a couple thousand. They risk big plays that just don’t work out. Cuz autism
My retarded ass has $1000c 2022 leaps.. up 50% ROFL. Probably will dump on the SP 500 run up that I think will happen after Dec 11
Notice how charles schwab autists have an actual job?
🧠
Some will but it will take at least a year
Best way to lose 10k fast
That’s awesome hahahaha
dude like 85% of wsb can’t even read a chart 😂 theres a difference between being greedy and being a full blown autist
 I'm the same way but with 3 accounts ranging from low to high risk and my outcome has been the exact opposite, lol. Obviously, the accounts that take less risk have more money and longer time horizons. My lowest risk account is only up 9% YTD (a lot of ETF's, Emerging markets holding it back), my long- term equities "mid-risk" account is 74% YTD (mostly big tech names as that is the industry I understand best), and the account I manage the most is my most risky YOLO account (pretty much trade on a daily basis - mostly tech options) is up 142% YTD. Try to keep that account under $8k-$10k by continuously transferring profits to the mid and low-risk accounts because with options in high beta names you can lose 30-50% REAL fast.
i got shit load of PLTR but still, I've heard too much bullshit to trust... hope we all balling tmrw

This has to be your first loss over $1,000. If my dumbass can recuperate so can you. Keep trading you’ll get it back

MW2 chat convinced me to stay offline for a few months tho lmaoooo

I fucking love that shit I wish I could find that comment
it wasnt a full 200k but it was my bonus + maybe 15-20k i had in savings that i said fuck it about
Because I've never felt the need to get involved on this autistic board and this is definitely not where I heard about Palantir nor why I bought it. I honestly think that a bunch of degenerates accidentally stumbled across a gem of stock and now they're getting burned because they think they were scammed. I have a ton of reasons I think this will blow up in the next year or so and I'm just advising people to do some research before dropping shares. As for the 12/4 calls...
Everything is political now. It’s fucking annoying.
Because brain is still in development till ~21 years and alcohol or other substances may prevent that
Ya but the morning is always confusing because:
1. Damn it already ripped up pre market, I missed it!
2. Shit it’s flat, could I be too early?
3. Wow it tanked, am I completely wrong?

Well I have to admit, if the covid hysteria has been good for nothing else, its been great for my portfolio
And those dollars are worth 10-20 percent more if they just slow production...they also have a lot of debt they need to service so they need higher prices like everyone else.
You’re overrated
Chose me and I *will* use it to buy more pltr 100%
Yeah, I have made more in one day with stocks/options then I ever have in a work day. But if I make the $900 a day working and walk with a wad of cash I'm so much happier then when I make $1000+ a day on robinhood. Maybe it's got something to do with the physical cash.

>Even my Biden bro friends agree this thing blew up 10x more then necessary only to drag down Trump.

Just like Bruce Lee said "Empty your mind, be formless
shapeless, like water put water into a cup, becomes the cup, put water into a teapot, becomes the teapot
water can flow or creep or drip or crash, be water my friend" pretty much saying be versatile, be balanced and diversify. Combo of boomer stocks, play it safe while also playing growth stocks, yoloing.
You're right that it wasn't about the government shutdown.

But it wasn't just the trade war either.  It was the trade war/new tariffs + Fed raising interest rates + yield inversions.

Imo Fed raising interest rates was the most significant of the events.
Tl;dr...this is a casino
The internet used to be like main street usa and random towns off the highway or train tracks. Now the internet is like a target superstore. Wsb doesn't really fit in an aisle at target.

This is the real story and most everyone, myself included, has gone through this (at least pre covid, not sure if they do face to face visits as much with social distancing measures in place). If you want to see for yourself, just get above 100 posts.

With a gross state product (GSP) of about $1.4 trillion, if California were a country, its economy would be surpassed only by the economies of the United States, Japan, Germany, the United Kingdom, and France (Figure 1). California accounts for the largest share – about 14% Florida 4%

Exactly. This is an IR physician training issue. These docs need to know that they can't push contrast with these devices. It's in the label, and it was clarified by the company in the June letter. Something like 30,000 thrombus aspirations are done a year with these devices. The company is actively expanding the technology to other indications. 

Trust me, I want to make money too but I don't see $PEN being taken down over this. Plus the premiums on this stock are expensive as fuck. 

PLTR 25c 3/19/21
>So if we lock the entire country down and cases still go up, it’s only because nobody is following the rules?

Why are you asking this as if it's this is what happened? If we locked down, cases *wouldn't* go up. So it's a nonsensical question.

Like I said: countries that truly locked down and contact-traced went back to life as normal like 6 months ago. Korea, Taiwan, New Zealand, etc.

“People may lawfully leave their residences while this order is in effect only to engage in the following activities”

Which then lists 50+ bullet points of things that can be done

Which then lists ESSENTIAL purposes as in-person retail shopping, swimming, golfing, shopping, going to parks, day camps, beaches, outside gyms, wineries, and a shitload of other stuff

Please tell me how you can’t hang outside anymore. The entire order is dedicated to things outside that remain open. Literally anything besides sporting and music events, just at reduced capacity if it’s dealing directly with people

Did you read the order?
I’m from LA and LA is trash, everyone is leaving LA. Only city worth living in Southern California is San Diego

People should know to only take advice from those who have profitably traded for years, not people who started trading during the fastest recovery in market history.

We just sell a call early for 30% gains. See it go to what could’ve been 300% Gainz then diamond hands our next call that was up 70% to a 100% loss and that’s why we all fucking suck at this.

If we had just a machine force sell all our shit at +40% Gainz we would be all up like 10K more than what we are now. At minimum.

We aren’t all wrong. We are just almost all retarded and greedy.

Good question, he's probably waiting for people to cash out to avoid the capital gains tax increase in 2021, this will affect the market as a whole, but TSLA will drill the hardest, or it could force a massive squeeze and go to 1000 since its the most shorted stock in the world
Think anything cool's gonna happen to AAPL tomorrow?
Just remember, even if the number on your account goes down, your shares do not.

Well... unless they go down so hard that they do a reverse split, but your ownership doesn't change. 

Well.... unless they issue a ton of shares for capital, but that just inflates the market cap. 

Well... unless they're doing that because they're fending off bankruptcy. Then you lose your shares. But only if they go bankrupt. 

Well... They could also sell the company at a valuation lower than the market cap that you bought it at and force feed cash into your account. So I guess there's that.
that's pretty cool

I see the company was approved by the FDA to expand its thrombus aspiration technology to the treatment of PEs, like, 10 days ago. Endovascular treatment of PEs is currently an underutilized therapy. That's a huge market opportunity. 

Of course the share price can still fall but the argument could equally be made that this is a buying opportunity.

You end up losing more money. It’s now a significant amount for you.

Hypothetically what’s your next move
Trek
2k shares avg 27.60 means currently a -$4.6 per share loss or -$9,200 (PLTR 23) as of 12/3 premarket. You can sell 20 calls at 25 for about $60 a contract ( gain $1200). if by Friday PLTR doesn't rise above $25, those calls expire and you keep the $1200. Monday you wake up and aim again for a target for that week. Calls should be higher with more time.

IF PLTR rockets and it passes $25 then your contracts will execute and you will sell all your shares at $25 giving you your premium ($1200) + PLTR @ $25 giving you your total loss of -$4000 instead of $9,200. Ideally, you can gain premium week by week by wheeling. It's not exponential gains, but it's measured. good luck

Kind of. Basically they're being tracked because they have a track record of beating the market. The date is an average. And the next numbers are ratio of wins:loses

No way lol. CRM is in DOW now too so that won't happen.

You're fine dude. Sell 2-3 week out covered calls around your average price and you can pull in about 7 grand premium with all those shares.

Yea that’s the opposite how you do it lol. That’s how you get fucked

Supposed to sell 45 days out with 25-30 delta, then close at 21 days and redo the trade (or sooner if it moves more).

Look up Tastytrade videos on YouTube into the science behind it. OTM options lose the most value between 45-21 days, something like 80% if I remember right. So you close it early cause the remaining 3 weeks only net the last 20% while presenting more risk, and you can just redo the trade for more profit. Also gives you time to roll your options in case something goes wrong
Imagine if the Senate pulls a fuck yup and votes yes just to specifically wreck every put holder and paper handed seller on weed stocks ?  It’s me, I’m the paper handed seller.

lancette di diamanti 👌💎
Copper Boom. China Hoarding Copper.  Copper Spot Price ATH.  Had buyout rumors.  Barrick Gold wanted to buy them.  Assuming a world recovery starting Summer 2021.  Supply and Demand issue with Copper.  Copper will probably be above $4.00 a pound. If that happens, FCX will make A LOT of profit.   If FCX dips a bit because of December sell off, it's a great entry point at $20 with $30c leaps.  I recommend watching FCX and if theres a metal's sell off like what happened in October, jump on it.  I think FCX can hit $40+ though in 1 year assuming world economic boom.

Okay I’ve kinda just been shitposting about fuk a lockdown but the amount of people who entirely support any lockdown here is a little concerning, and frankly, not very YOLO of you guys
You know, as utterly ridiculous as you're being since your argument relies on me spending tens of hours finding, formatting, and analyzing data to show a common knowledge (self fulfilling prophetic) trend... I might just do that. 

But first riddle me this: why would an institution post a price target if it had no sway on the market? What would they gain otherwise if there was no discernable effect on price action? Why not just keep their "analysis" to themselves?
Hey you are stealing my stockwits post .lol
Sure but if you came down here and met some of my fine fellow Texans you’d know they’ve been stockpiling guns and ammo since rumors of Obama martial law 8 years ago just waiting to be told get in their house and stay there. It just won’t happen here.

Most people don't fully understand evolution (they can't describe it accurately) and a lot of people don't 'believe' in it at all.

Also it makes little to no difference that they don't understand it, they are mostly cogs in a machine. So let them be blissfully ignorant.

Case in point, that teach was a cog in a horribly inefficient public education machine which was designed for/in the agricultural age not the information age.

Have you tried their underwear? It's fucking cash. Kinda like SAXX but more silky smooth

These questions you're asking, should be typed into Google. Read read read. Watch YouTube videos. There's plenty of instruction. Learn all about options. Calls, puts, spreads, hedges, the greeks, IV, etc. You should know all this stuff before you even think about playing any option.

They basically gave away shares instead of dividend and/or offered shares drastically cheap to shareholders.

I looked a bit earlier today when I noticed it dropped like a stone.
Pull some out at least 1-2k or you’ll kick yourself. Personally I’d pull it all out and invest in a more robust stock but this is WSB. PLTR $40c 12/4

I'm sorry you don't have any friends and your family didn't love you enough to give you attention. Somehow the back and forth and the consistent -2 on your comments is enough to keep you coming back. Maybe your wife will leave Chad and come back but you should probably see a shrink bud 🤡
hey man, that's cool, i love ice road trucking, king crab fishing, lookin for gold, livin below zero, state troopin, etc. All that history channel stuff.
Can someone give me a bull case for why a company would use whatever slack becomes with this merger over Microsoft teams or google meet or some equivalent which they 100% already have for free as package with another service they pay for, is fully integrated with their other productivity tools (think teams with word, excel, outlook, etc) and have already been using for months and have employees used to and trained up on. I get the value of slack for clubs and more informal groups, but i just don’t see what value it adds for salesforces customer base.
Takbir for these calls!
>hello i can't read, what is the $PLTR call strike price suggested as per your model?

I can tell you that PLTR buying decreased on strike price of 30 for this week.

[http://goldensweeps.com/analysis.php?market=PLTR&startDate=12-01-2020&endDate=12-03-2020](http://goldensweeps.com/analysis.php?market=PLTR&startDate=12-01-2020&endDate=12-03-2020)

We can also see that selling increased for 20. The selling volume was greater than the buying volume this week.

  
I definitely wouldn't go all in PLTR this week.

I would need to do some more research for the future weeks though, but thats possible with ALL. 

Anyway, we will be making it very easy for everyone to see the moves in coming week, when we change a few things.
entire market went up from a red open

Sounds like in the majority of the cases the surgeons were using the Xtra flex either with contrast dye or with non-Penumbra parts, both of which the Xtra Flex warns against doing. So there's definitely an element of user error here. Sounds like the company is playing its cards close to determine if it really is defective, probably an internal review first and not wanting to admit possible mistakes unless they know they have one on their hands. 

I guess to me a ceo dumping shares on possible bad news isn't strange since he may be fired if the news is bad enough, or just buy back in for cheaper later. I'd just be shocked to see a decline to your stike price so quickly, especially considering Pen was trading around 140 at the time of this device's release.

This is interesting. I’m confused by the numbers - the market value for gme is correct, but the market value of the call options on wallmine for positions like cvs is completely different than whalewisdom. This obviously is different than what other people on the thread are saying about it being under 5% of his portfolio.

Now we don’t know the strike or the price per contract so I don’t understand the formula for how they arrived at it.

Haha you prob think you have to own the 100 shares don’t you? It’s just the price of the premium. So if it’s $1.80 for the call you’re looking at, It’s actually $180.

Plus Palantir is not a bad company but they’re not exactly the next big thing. Have you seen a demo of their software? Do you know how their pricing works? I used to work in fraud detection in insurance and palantir have a horrible reputation the industry. Very high upfront fixed costs and software not that better than many of their competitors.

Anyone else think it would be ridiculous for opec to do anything other than cut production....the entire world is going to need oil when the vaccine becomes available and the US has sharply cut production .... if ur entire economy was based on the price of oil why would you do anything other than jack up the price right as everyone needs it..

Right I understand that, but since they are covered if it goes above the strike price the increased value of your 100 stocks equals the loss of selling to the call holder, right? So it’s not what you want but you don’t lose money in that scenario?
It was good bat soup which is what makes all of this so surprising really.
 No that’s not what happened at all. There was no change in the valuation or any fundamental metrics at all. It’s the sentiment towards a company that was influenced by one of the largest institutional shareholders. Companies are worth whatever you can buy them or sell them for. Price targets without fundamental changes are just performance art intended to cause a short term change in the stocks price.

Just short the things that are up the most. Big Tech is expected to be hit extremely hard by any crash so short them. Could also short corporate bonds ($HYG). Only short these once you see confirmation that the trend has reversed, otherwise keep on being bullish.

Girlfriend and I started trading around the same time these last couple of months. I made a +$2000 profit off of shares and ended up joining this community.

She's relatively new, so she asks me for advice on what to trade and generally rolls with it because I have been in the green and browse Market Watch like a true autist.

I end up joining this community and seeing all the call contract porn during the last few months, and decide to experiment option contracts through telling her on what positions to get in:

NIO $80c 1/15/2021 😬

GME $27c 12/4 

GME $29c 1/8/2021

Just sold QS shares at a loss too. (Limit sell at under $30 and of course it dropped).

I was influenced by this sub on NIO and GME positions, but really, I am the ultimate retard.   
It's only a matter of time before she leaves me for some Chad PLTR millionaire. So I ask you, WSB, what call options should I tell her to get next?

Okay?
I think going forward if I see a meme stock mooning after already being well over extended on a Friday I might take a stab at 0dte’a after the initial morning buyers run out of fuel. 

I subscribe to spot gamma and I think Pltr had something like 50 percent of its gamma rolling off that Friday due to so much of the call buying expiring so soon due to this sub going hog wild on weeklies. 

My problem is as much as I am interested in the flow analytics from saueezemetrics and spot gamma, I’m an options noob and don’t know how to analyze the Greeks well.

But what about the Sandra bullock?
If you sell covered calls you don’t want the stock to reach the strike of your option contract. If it closes below that price by the exp. then you get to keep the premium.
Lmao 🤡
Was the coke sold separately?
The risk is whatever you spent to purchase them essentially evaporates of it doesn’t reach the strike price by the expiration. You can only lose what the contract cost, but the upside is in theory limitless.

The fact he thought Nikola and GM had "merged" is scary enough.
If you sell covered calls ATM aren’t you nearly guaranteed to break even? If it goes way up you break even, if it goes down you earn the option premium. Only way you lose is if the stock drops more than whatever the premium was, right?

That money isn’t going to be used to finance consumer goods (cars, appliances, etc). It’s going into rent, mortgage, savings accounts, student loans. Just look at the M2 breakdown. More money entering the economy isn’t sufficient to create inflation. For inflation people need to borrow, so that interest is generated. THAT is how money is created; brr is just the government borrowing money from itself. As for your thoughts on the necessity of a relief package and how it’s going to be paid for - I agree.  it’s not gonna be pretty.
In that order exactly

LA was a timebomb even before Corona. This just is speeding up the process.
That's 1.5 years of your life bro
I honestly believe pltr might become the next rkt after the hype and volatility fizzle out, esp after a few more ER and the market realize it isn't some crazy growth story, covid logistics or not.
This hurts because it's true.
Jumbo jet crash that will only kill your senior relatives.
This is the way

If you bought 64k worth of a stock you couldn’t spell 2 weeks ago you deserved that.
I like my socialist health care up here in Canada eh. You should try it. It's better then a beaver tail on a muskeg trail.
Especially when it dumps 😬, “sell the news”
I am not sure if they short shares and/or use options, but if they were clever they would take advantage of 0dte when these situations present. Only really matters what we do..

The play on Friday was PLTR 29P near open and NIO 45P a few Fridays ago (.05/.10 to almost 5.00, and 20-bagger in about an hour). Spreads were good too. 

When the YY report came out (not a Friday) spreads were horrible, but you could have still made bank on weeklies. Shorting shares and covering one hour before close would have been safer there. I didn't touch it. 

I hate to write this because I know someone with limited understanding will go broke chasing and trying to anticipate this. ...may delete this in a few hours...

Yeah fuck that you right
I don't understand how people that stupid can actually exist
Nailed it in your last paragraph there. I don’t care. The bid ask spread is narrow and calls get eaten up when you sell. I also had a 60 bagger on ACB last month, so I know it can pay.
I went to buy and realized I already owned it. Let’s vaporize boomers
Exactly right cheers
Just buy some boomer stocks in short term. They have good upside with the vax news and not as much downside cuz boomers are holding for years and years. Wait for big dips in meme stonks and reload. Boomer stocks > cash
Oh hmm didn't know you could do that I thought they just hit the ol blockbutton and ignored your calls (not /s). Thanks.

edit: let's say I was out of trades and spun $2k into $4k and sold. How much would I need to deposit?
Just buy shares, bish.

You did good here OP; was hesitant on keeping my shares, but decided to commit anyways. Your post confirmed my decision, so thanks for that.

Salesforce lost more in market cap since news of the acquisition broke than what they paid for Slack.  And they should only technically drop by what they overpaid, not the full amount.  They can't possibly be down for that reason.

the price target isn't why stock dropped.

go get an extract of all price targets made and find causality, i dare you.

The stock dropped becuase it ran up 150%, and the market decided a 17yr old company with limited growth potential isn't worth that.
The amount of people who have not heard of pltr till recently was mind blowing to me

They had to basically garbage a bunch if their big facilities that were under construction already, because they couldn't keep the lights on... how tf they supposed to expand into US and Mexico markets lol

CGC APHA and even CRON are way better weed plays than ACB

Yes but check out the support it has been building the past few weeks. Hits all time highs and dumps 3k but quickly recovers and then dumps again but this time only 1600ish. Again, recovers and makes new all time highs and again dumps about 1k and had been quickly building a strong 19k support line as of last few days. 20k is where we see shit get real and hype and fomo start setting in. Calling it now
where is this la lockdown news from? can't find anything
Because a lot of people here are in fact morons.
This may be the smartest thing I've seen in this sub.

You're missing the point. Focus here. When an institution has the power to publish a price target and within minutes the stock moves ~5% in that direction... That's too much influence for one entity to have. It can and will be abused. Abuse of people's trust for personal gain + consistent history of speaking from the rectum = fuck face.

Priced in, it's hard to say anything is with audists like us controling the market. I feel for LEAPS it would need to be baked to the core. Our attention span is to short for that to happen.  Something more shiny will come along.

I understand it will trade on in other markets. But  U.S. might be limited to them buy ETFs and mutual funds.
This.  I deal with this all the time as a teacher.  "I can afford to send my kids to private school" so fuck low SES children and black families who will spread this shit to their already underserved families who have shit access to healthcare because some school board member wants to make sure that rich white kids have access to wrestling scholarships.   Sorry, it's a personal thing.
Alright obviously the bears that are still here weren’t here in March and April

Let’s have a quick history lesson

Cities in Cali started to lockdown on March 17th and then full state on March 19th, which was first in the country

On March 19th SPY closed at $240

We ended up having lockdowns across the country the following two weeks up until Georgia issued stay at home on April 2nd

SPY closed April 2nd at $252. Throughout all the lockdown announcements

Do bears wanna answer what happened even after that
yep I sold 150 at 7.37 thinking it wouldn't even hit my limit sell 7.85 only to pop over 11 two days later

why not brrr? That's the main reason. relief packages are gonna be needed to prevent the "benefits cliff" that's coming. So much so that might not even have spent 50% of what we need to to prevent mass evictions/loan defaults/etc. Also can't increase taxes too much. Why? Because most jobs are remote now. Increase taxes past the 20-30% for most people currently, and many people leave the country. If my effective tax rate ever hits 50% or more, I'm getting the fuck outta America. But where else will america get money to pay our debts?

me too. the first part is like no travel on foot. I was like holy shit this is for real. And then I kept reading and it's like yeah everything's the same.
As real as it gets
Lol np boo. I agreed with you btw about deflation, but I really think it's gonna be bullish for the metals with all the news of Biden wanting to pass stim quickly. Market is forward thinking after all :). DD post coming
A few things, previous earnings blew up, JKS has been testing and pushing mid-high 70s on practically no catalyst. When it dropped after last earnings, it took almost 2 weeks to come down. It tested 76 last Monday. I'm expecting minimum 80 with a high of 100. Exit plan 400 shares at 80-85, and 100 shares to ride. This market is different than last earnings, but I think I might be pleasantly surprised if this keeps running after market open. Tbh, didnt follow ENPH or MAXN, so can't answer that. Also, I'm not an expert.
Username checks out
Your a weirdo
It really does look poised to take off. Much more than something like PLTR that’s already up an insane amount lol.

Anyone who's investing in Chinese stocks when we're the closest we've ever been to a Cold War 2.0 deserves to be cucked.

The pltr bandwagon is retarded. Congrats on yoloing into this stock because of your fomo. The valuations saying the stock is going up are showing 10x’s the actual value of the company. It’s also a super new company with not a ton of traction and which openly relies on their insider connections. But mostly, seeing that people think that snowflake is comparable to Palantir is retarded. Snowflake is a cloud computation and storage IaaS company and pltr and salesforce are actually platforms which collect and serve data. Not all tech stocks are the same or have the same potential. Invest better ppl.
Just uber
new one incoming soon. shhh
The struggle is real bro.
What covered calls are you selling? I’ve got a ton of shares too and looking to take advantage of some retards while trying to lower my cost basis and collecting their premiums

He's barely going to pay any taxes on this if he doesn't have an actual job. Probably \~$1k. And if he does have a job, the withholdings will probably cover some of that tax bill so it won't be too much out of pocket.

Implied Volatility.. stocks like NIO, PLTR have high IV on options right now because they have volatile price action.. which means the options are priced at a very high premium and you need major upside/downside to breakeven on your calls/puts

Any lockdown will probably be trigger by hospital icu teaching full capacity instead of death toll. Soon governors will have to either let health care system collapse under load( those care giver has been working non stop for nearly a year, Ppe and ventilators are not an issue, staffing is) or lockdown for two weeks until Christmas.

Eh...we use both, and Slack is the only one with the integration we use in a certain part of our company. Plus it’s just more polished than teams. Don’t get me wrong- Teams is great in that it’s included in Office365. But man, it still feels so clunky. Trying to search for old threads is still a massive pain, keeping track of the notifications doesn’t reliably work, the desktop app on Macs literally will not detect the aux port earbuds (have to use the browser web app). Not to mention I’ve lost message drafts I’m in the middle of typing, the ability to right click a posted image randomly doesn’t work without restarting the entire Teams application..I’m sure there’s some I’m forgetting. But with Slack, everything makes sense, is organized well, and simply works. Teams is younger, so I’ll give due credit to the ‘time to develop aspect. But neither are certainly going anywhere.
I agree with this heavily

1. VWs do not compete with teslas, they compete on a significantly lower scale. Tesla competition is the Porsche Taycan and that thing shits on the model S. Like so bad I had mo idea it existed a few weeks ago and now I wouldnt even consider a model S because they need an update. 

2. You are discounting manufacturing infrastructure. If they coukd grab ford they would increase TTM on new models exponentially. Worth any price.

Jet7 is 50% of their revenue and was rushed to market in response to competitors like STRYKER putting better devices in the market. $pen is/was the leader in the space, rushed the flexible Jet7 to market to compete, and now refused to pull it because things have gone too far.

[Per Car Gurus](https://www.cargurus.com/Cars/price-trends/), used car prices are up significantly for every single car maker save for five: Alfa, Genesis, McLaren, Scion(RIP), and Tesla. With Tesla dropping the most by a pretty big margin.

Lol this looks identical to the SQ chart
I see tendie potential. Everyday there is an opportunity!
how so?
Lol who cares the only difference here is that insiders could sell immediately. Which they did in large numbers.

Again, keeping a good portion of your shares in a company you founded is not “extremely bullish” especially when you’ve already offloaded some 35%. 

It’s just a normal thing to do. In fact the only thing worse would be completely divesting from the company, when there are tons of things better like keeping your full stake, buying more, or even buying options. The latter of those three would definitely be extremely bullish.

You’re completely off it if you think “selling can even be bullish” lol.

There is a reason it has never mooned. Look up Box earnings earlier this week for a baseline.  
  
That space (cloud storage) is filled with the big boys just giving it away for free. specially Microsoft. They are doing the same to Dropbox with OneDrive like they are doing to Slack with Teams. Bundling large enterprise storage with O365.

Thanks for these man. Top movers based on previous close would be dope. It would also be interesting to see top options expiring in next month/6 month/1-2 years.  IE "Top Dec (or Jan) exp option move" "Top Jan '22 option move" "Top Jan '23 option move". If that makes sense?
nope. it's usually 3-4 sessions
Leadership during a pandemic would’ve been nice I agree. Our leadership shrugged it off as nothing, turned it into a political issue and then made anything that would’ve been beneficial to stopping the spread out to be a personal attack on his administration. Now we are gonna end up with a fucked economy and everyone sick and dying because we 1/2 assed both sides. Don’t like to be pessimistic but next year is looking a lot shittier than this year by a long shot. Covid will still be here and all these massive issues we’ve been delaying by printing will come to surface.
Guys stop buying calls and puts when IV is 200% .. you’re just paying rent for r/thetagang.. just stay the F away from options when IV is peak

LA is a time bomb. It is probably the worst city to lock down in the entire country. I don't even care what this means for the market. Shits going to get nasty.
Yeah. It's the hunger games out there
Do you know about a person called  Peter thiel? If you have ever watched Silicon Valley, “ the autistic billionaire genius” character was based on him. He is a real deal. PayPal, Facebook, SpaceX, Trump(supported in 2016) and won every time.

How much was everyone’s initial investment when they started WSBing? And how much are you up/down? I started at $500 and worked my way up to $25k but deposited another $800 along the way to buy more, then lost it all. Then I deposited ~$2k on separate occasions and lost it all. Back at $2.1k but down $1.7k overall
idk if so, Peter looks like he's about to to sell his shares feelsbad... more dumpage coming :(

I can’t google it or search the ticker on Twitter for you, just like I can’t buy the puts for you fella.
hello i can't read, what is the $PLTR call strike price suggested as per your model?
Gonna just post this here: 

https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-55158060

tl;dr for you retards:

- Palmer Luckey - aka, guy who founded Oculus has founded a surveillance start up called ***Anduril***
- He wants to get into more military contracts
- Signed a contract earlier this year to build a virtual wall between US-Mexico

In case you missed it: Anduril is another LOTR reference, just like Palantir. And just like Karp, Luckey is now advocating for working on behalf of Uncle Sam. 

You know what they say: imitation is the finest form of flattery.

PLTR 40C 12/31
fuck your doritos
I'd give you an award for this, but I spent all my money on 0 DTE 30% OTM calls. Sorry, not sorry
SPY 380 12/31 say hi
Plus I couldn’t take it as seriously once I saw the gay cop from Reno 911 act in it
Im sorry friend but you’re stupid. PLTR is incredibly cheap compared with its long term value. Even short term, Christ. One little correction and peoples conviction turns too jelly. If you’re this weak you shouldn’t buy stock.
Not sure if intentional but that's a very clever Christian Bale joke
Once you hit $10 million, you can live off your assets, invite onlyFans hoes to your yacht and still be in the green. The Fed is the single largest cause of wealth inequality to ever exist.

Dude it isn’t voluntary in MI, we have been partially shutdown for over a week.  Indoor dining got closed.
You think it can fall that quickly by the 18th though? 

Im not saying you're wrong, just that that quick of a fall would be insane. The devices would need to have actively harmed tons of people rather than simply be defective imo. Do you know exactly which product(s) it is? There are many ways to deal non-invasive ways to deal with a clot, so I wonder exactly how widespread the impact could be. Do you know?

So aim it at the Sun then. Problem solved
Actually a ton best education I could get, but the biggest takeaway I learned is don’t get greedy ever there were times when I knew my trade was going south and I kept it in just to maybe get some back need to cut losses or gains quickly to keep fighting
All the good dumps happen overnight and don’t give us a chance to trade it during RTH. F this 💩
Ya I’m in MI buddy totally different cases. I’m talking about the US Supreme Court and constitutional due process, not Gretchens powers under the emergency powers act which was Michigan specific.

Not saying there’s a clear cut answer but I’d like to see what the court does, could be an indication of what we’re in for with ACB. It’s interesting because conservative judges very much favor state sovereignty and not so much individual due process rights but in statements they’ve seemed kinda anti lockdown so it would be kinda like a fight within the conservative faction.
I don’t think you guys are being honest with yourselves. Read the full quote from the article. He says that they don’t want to be public bc they want to focus on revenue growth and expanding. Public companies have a lot of pressure to become profitable. 

If you just read the headline it could be interpreted as maybe a spac, but if you read the article it’s obvious.

“This dude fucks.”
And yet, real wages finally were going up, including in bottom half, at a rate faster than top half, in the last few years prior to COVID... this policy finally worked well when we hit full employment. If we solve college and medical cost inflation it would have not that many drawbacks.

There are also a lot of efficiencies hitting the economy too out of the newest wave of digital industrial revolution. This is not all froth. Most of it I think is actually real (ish). Real wages up with costs of things flat or down is pretty amazing when you think about it.
those were seoarately bought jan calls. Dec 11 calls that far out are too risky so i didnt double down on them instead bought jan calls
Just read the LA order. There’s like 40+ different exemptions lol. All I gleaned from that was close stuff after 10 pm and operate at reduced capacity

TD market sold my ATM BKNG puts 2 weeks ago 15 minutes before market closed on Friday without contacting me. They sold them for $1.50 ($150 each, and I had 5 of them). I was sitting at my desk watching and getting ready to exit anyways. 2 minutes later they were $8 in the money. 10 minutes later (still 5 mins before close) they were $14 in the money. And 2 mins before market close they were $25 in the money. So yea, F TD.

i don't think it's an earnings dip. earnings, outlook were great! i think it's a sell off that was truggered when the slack deal was furst announced and it started plungung yesterday after they announced the 28 billion dollar figure for slack buy out. I think like NVDA, AMD, and TDOC that made huge acquisitions, CRM is going to bounce off soon.

GME is only 11% currently with a reduction in Nov. He's putting more money into other companies as we speak and this is only based on 13Fs so it is definitely inaccurate. 

Considering the market value with appreciating value it is likely that over time GME will become less and less of a favorite since he owned it in 2015 as well (more of it) and that portfolio was the last public record Scion released as far as I know showing it wasn't even in the top 10 holdings.
Actually it slowed down the virus by huge amounts. Also, what place was locked down for 10 months?

That dude wasn't saying it because he cares about people getting COVID he was saying it to make himself feel better and make himself look important in front of his daughter. If he had any brains he would realize that if you are outside and no one is near you your chances of catching any virus, not just COVID are near zero. I am not an anti-masker in the least but there is such a thing as taking precautions too far, and you know, using logic, just saying.

This sub never fails to amaze me
If people could just wear masks and stay away from each other as much as possible, lockdowns wouldn’t be needed. But since like 35% of this country doesn’t understand basic science, here we are.
Lol hating on CA is the dumbest shit. It's like 15% of our economy and a powerhouse of tech/research. It even grows tons of a wide variety of crops. The US would be complete trash without it.
Y’all realize lockdowns didn’t matter in March. It took college and the nba to get cancelled before anyone thought it was serious

Gl dude, they have crazy good retention rates (90%+) and super high growth rates. The more people that sign up, the more people that will stick with the peloton and the more friends they tell, and the faster they grow. 

Personally, I'd wait to see numbers drop YOY before you leap short it, otherwise your fighting an early stage growth business made to make tons of money  and doing extremely well; and the boost with covid isn't a short term stagnation, in my opinion but a catapult. 

Increased assets, increased margins, increased revenue -- everything points to a stronger company for the future.
