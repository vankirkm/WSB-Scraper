Why would there be a sell off?
Cum in it. The fuck kind of dumb question is this.
You’re spending less on the options contract for a specific underlying asset than you would if you bought the stock outright for that same company on the exchange. Since you’re spending less money upfront, you have more money in your pocket for diversification and making additional investments.


You’re limited on how much money you stand to lose. Unlike some other options strategies in which you can potentially lose an unlimited amount of money, the deep in the money call protects your downside.


 You can leverage your options contract against the actual underlying asset’s stock to boost your profits even higher.


 There’s no technical upside cap on how much money you can make, so there’s outstanding profit potential from deep in the money calls.


 The ratio of downside losses to upside profits is weighted in your favor. You stand to earn far more than you would lose should the stock move in an unfavorable direction.

These high-delta calls result in options contracts that act like regular stocks. This makes them substantially less volatile and easier to manage.
Guys I'm forming a search bloc for Baba Ma who's in??
Fuck.
oof.
It seems in your anger... you killed him.

Speculation, but he has been buying a lot of stock and owns 12.9% of the company. If he continues to add to his positio, he will have enough power to force a vote to add him as a board member or start a hostile takeover. The DD above talks more about it. And I meant June not April. We will know around March/April if he wants to bring this up to a vote (board member thing)

I did via Decisive.com. It's a PE company. You can also use EquityZen and ForgeGlobal. I preferred PE as it assured allocation. EquityZen is very good actually as well and you can start by investing as low as 10k usd, but allocations are not guarantee and it is first come first serve. You can sign and confirm interest that doesn't cost you anything. if they inform you, act asap unless someone else will pick.

They outsource. My mom worked on their award points program for years, and before she got let go in August Gamestop renewed their contract w/ my mom's work for another 5 years. If my mom told me that before I would've been balls deep in GME by summer, because I remember hearing about Burry having a stake in it a little before summer. But yea until RC puts his all his people in place, don't expect crazy SV jobs popping up for them, but I thought I did see some posted a month ago, not a lot. There was something about monetization idk there was a DD post about it around Q3 earnings.

You’re both right - 

the moderate dem establishment is edged to the left on social issues, often symbolically, by that otherwise disenfranchised far left base. It’s a concession that guarantees support without sacrificing power for them

And if it appealed to the right base, republicans would do it too. I’m very much of the opinion that on many of the soft-policy issues it’s not a difference in the party’s ideology but a necessary accommodation to a base they underrepresent.

It's not in the CCP's best interest to damage  BABA (nations always act in self interest) and BABA's policies they're challenging *are* anticompetitive.  These are the same retards that believe China is actually a communist country and democrats are scary socialists.

Unless you think BABA's value is tied to a few of their questionable policies and Jack ma then buy the fucking dip retards.

For S&P500 specifically, they have selection criteria. If a company stops being profitable for X quarters, then it can get dropped, right? Don’t you think this means that there are less zombie companies in SP500?

Great write up btw.
Just for the first one: she essentially bet MSFT would be $130 on 3/19/21. More accurately she purchased the option to buy 100 shares of MSFT for $130 a share. She paid $6,020 for this option, but she did it 150 times, paying 6020x150=903500. She can now sell these options for more than $6,020 a piece (approximately 60% more) since the price of MSFT is higher now, and paying $130 a share will be likely even more in the money than now on March 19. Does that make sense?

I would maybe buy more on a pullback. I think it’s still pretty risky and I honestly don’t know enough. As it is now my main risk is leaving tendies on the table. 
I could handle a 30% pullback no problem, but if I bought a lot more and averaged up I may not be as willing to hold through it. Just watching price, if it starts breaking down technically I can get out and still have made a nice gain

Fair point but I am naturally designed to seek out as much experience as possible and place more priority over that than simply being and taking in the present moment unless I'm like lying sunbathing in the beach or a peaceful nature place. I feel a compulsion to do as possible when traveling or going somewhere to maximize my sense of satisfaction. It's more of a mindset ultimately. I suppose my happiness is a lot more conditional and dependent on circumstances and the hedonism or pleasure that comes into account. I see that the ultimate goal is to enjoy that desire while also finding peace in the small things throughout the day as you say but maybe it's just me, but sometimes it doesn't feel like "enough".

Incorrect - range anxiety is only a thing for people looking into EV, it’s not a thing when you switch. People keep trying to quote the supercharger network, but it’s not like gas stations. The benefit to EV is that you charge where you’re parked, so most owners are pulling their “fuel” from the grid at home. Sure, useful for cross country trips and the network is what tips the scale on people purchasing EV because they can then take their car anywhere, but day-to-day? They’re charging at home.

He said in order to get the loan, he had to get one where you pay all the interest up front.

This makes it impossible to refinance at a lower rate cause refinancing at this point is wouldn't make sense since he has only principle to pay off.

He basically got taken advantage of by predatory lenders.

**In honor of our girl Nancy Pelosi being reelected lets check on her option plays:**

At the end of February 2020 she purchased:

>150 MSFT $130 strike calls expiration 3/19/21 at a price of 60.20

>100 MSFT $140 strike calls expiration 3/19/21 at a price of 51.55

Pelosi paid around $1.4 mil for these options and they are worth today around:

#$2,200,000

This is why we call her 💎 Diamond Hands Pelosi around here, she held it through the pandemic after being down 60%.

So what is her latest options move? Heavy bet on PayPal this summer, she got a lot of shares and Purchased 50 call options with a strike of $100 and an expiration date of 01/21/2022

*source: https://disclosures-clerk.house.gov/PublicDisclosure/FinancialDisclosure*

Use the force!
if everybody is expecting q4 ER to be over the estimates then how much of a "surprise" will it actually be? and then this raises the question how much of this "surprise" has already been priced in? 

another question that i've always wanted to ask is given that at the start of the year GME was trading at $4-5 and the current valuation is $18-19 this already represents x4 growth. all the DD is based crazy valuations but what is the baseline for these valuations? from $4 or from $18?

That's fine.  It just makes the puts I'm interested cheaper to buy to add on.

It’s only unethical if I don’t make money.
Thanks for the explanation. I picked for example  a 700 strike expiring March 2023. If these are held to expiration and stock is at say 630 you lose money. I guess it’s the theta burn? Better to play a spread to bring average cost down I guess

Hahahaha

Great point. I guess the next question is, is the stock market "healthy" to invest that saved dough into. Def not going to gamble it all on a unicorn, more likely SP500
Also, with inflation and how little we make compared to what is takes to get by today - with everything being like .01% return you cut really get anywhere locling money in. You have to pick between using what disposable income you have on what you need now or locking it up for Lmlst no return.

Hey buddy,
Let me try to answer with my limited capabilities. If you know NN/PCA/ML/DL then leading to AI is not difficult. In a crude way AI adds a decision criterion and action over you learning. Off course we both know it is more than that in codes.

I feel you when you say you dont feel magic and in my view i felt the same sometime. The task Palantir solving is somthing that is not entirely computer and AI assisted. if you see the demo and what Karp says, their target is to empower the most frontline employees with the similar kind of decision making ability as top PHD and C-suite.

In short, it is helping them to do tasks which are critical and take much longer with better insight and improved consistency with big picture clarity. As i understand that their AI suite has several bespoke portion, this is the reason deploying Palantir is not straightforward in the starting and company don't have domain expertise. So there is a phase where they work with client and both builds the application part and what insights to focus. Based on your nickname, i believe you have fair understanding of upstream oil business and if you see BP example, its very eye opening. SLB,HAL, BHGE who are established player in O&G services and digital space can deliver the same solution. What sets Palantir Unique is their ability to scaleup. Scaling up and speed to market is the Achilles heal of industry. This is why we see so many successful pilots, POC and very limited full scale deployment.

I don't expect Gotham to help me write code. I do expect Gotham to help me build and understand how data is flowing in my decision making analysis

Which mod’s dick do I have to suck for a flair?
It depends on what put you pick! It depends on the strike price and expiration. If you pick a far out-of-the-money put (say, a $550 put when Tesla is currently at $705) then yes, you will need a catastrophic drop to make a profit. If you pick a safer put, say $680 for February, you will only need a small drop to profit. However, the safer puts are much more expensive

What happened to best buy?
Nokia is building 5g for the moon and Europe.  They switch from the more expensive 5g tower builds to the cheaper version that other companies had after realizing the added cost didn’t improve performance.  This change should reverse the downward trending tops from the last two years as they begin to capitalize on their new competitive price points and global fears of Chinese censorship.  With huawei being ditched, they are likely in for a bigger market share in Europe and the West, though they still are competing with Erikson.

Define “wrong in most of his posts” (which doesn’t seem like a lot of posts). Guess what, valuations are completely out of wack. It’s why you have IPOs that take MONTHs by investment banks to find a valuation, popping 100% when they hit the secondary market because retail doesn’t care. So while OP is calling out that valuations are way off, in other posts he’s not necessarily saying they’re going to go down, just saying that the market is displaying irrational exuberance (which it is). I’m guessing that a lot of retail who is trading in taxable accounts doesn’t want to pay short-term capital gains and is trying to hold for at least a year. But many of them are also finding themselves heavily weighted/exposed on TSLA. Once things start to falter, or TSLA misses any targets, they’re gonna get crushed like a soufflé with a sledgehammer.
Whoever is giving all these fucking platinums you better be throwing at least 2x the money you spent on that shit back into GME shares. Do your part and stop wasting money on useless awards.
Same here. Tan and ICLN are my boomer stocks.

The float is atrocious. The price, in this one instance, just doesn't matter towards the potential here. Even if you had everyone squeeze this stock on the planet it wouldn't move a whole $2.

Ryan Cohen is a huge catalyst for this stock, he’s going to make a move within the next 6-8mths and the price will fly before we even find out if his plans can actually turn GME around.

This year, researchers welcomed a raft of world-first barnyard creatures. **Among them are pandemic-proof pigs, whose cells have been edited to remove the molecular lock-and-key mechanism that a variety of respiratory viruses use to infect them, and chickens Crispr’d to make them impervious to a common bird disease caused by the avian leukosis virus**

Why diversify? all you need is a bunch of PLTR calls :)
I have a technical question for you. I know some machine learning, neural nets, machine vision, signals math etc. I don't know the math or algos behind AI. I watched the demo of Gotham led by a PLTR engineer. I get the machine analyst interface and I am sure that this could be powerful for enterprise...

but, I was expecting more voodoo AI stuff in the demo. I get the concept of analyst machine interface and their pitch of the operating system of a business. I get that. It's pretty too. 

What I don't get is where the AI comes in. Is the AI basically a bespoke product of Palantir to scour the clients databases and bring it all together?

Or can it also assist the analyst in writing algos to filter and find patterns like a human analyst would? Is that AI bespoke too or is it done from within the client's company?

Sorry for asking this on fucking WSB like a 'tard.

Hey macareña
And especially don’t forget how fragile our world can be for many. We can’t go back to the way things were before 2020, it be the ultimate failure to just rebuild everything the way it was. 

Even if we beat Covid, nature has plenty of other nasties just waiting to make the jump. If something as Covid can have such dramatic effects on our economic, and social lives we should be terrified of what something even worse could do.

Let’s all try to build something new and better then before and don’t sweep this all into the dust bin of history to be forgotten in a few years. We all have a duty to try and find ways to make things better for ourselves and our descendants.

$APHA is a piece of shit stock. Look at its movement since last 6 weeks. Any good news, this stock tanks like a bitch.
No one knows what will happen yet, the bear or the bull case.  Right now though the bear case has been delayed so the market is reflecting that in the rise in share price - there's enough holes in that simplified bear theory to make investors question it.  I think it could still go either way but I lean towards the Bull case due to gaming being a niche market and Microsoft giving them a line.  Both Microsoft and Sony said that the next generation consoles will still have discs as well.

Bull to your Bear

"GME survives as digital distribution of games becoming the overwhelming majority of all game sells was overstated.  Partners realize a thriving gaming ecosystem is beneficial to all players and have exclusive agreements with GameStop ensuring the company participates in the digital ecosystem.  At the same time, GameStop reduces their physical footprint significantly and focus more on an e-commerce platform"

An engineer with an MBA from a top school -  you mean a fucking idiot?  I agree.
I read the alchemy of finance and it really makes sense, especially in our modern context. The V shaped recovery is exactly what Soros talks about given the amount of debt talked about in the system. I also think it means the free market, to do things like remove zombies from etfs will have massive negative spikes eventually, but they all will level out.

Stocks are always up but let’s take a moment to reflect on last year and the 350,000 people who have died so far.

We might be rolling in tendies some of us, but it hasn’t been a fun year for many. Some people I know lost loved ones, and many more still are. So I say the month of January, we should all do something to make someone’s day a little brighter, especially if they lost someone last year.

And that’s my call out to the soul of WSB; as futile as it might be. Happy new year everyone and stay safe; we ain’t out of the woods yet health wise.

A couple of their recent glassdoor reviews mention that they are focusing on outsourcing/off-shoring development for an upcoming large project. This would seem to validate your hypothesis. 

Scary part is that they're just getting started when their main competitors have been doing ecommerce well for years. There's definitely room for a gamer-targeted online experience better than amazon & walmart provide - but it's going to take at least a year or two to get it right if they go it alone.  If I'm Cohen, I'm looking to partner with (or be aquired by) an existing player who has the technical expertise and/or existing platforms.

Would be interesting to see a merger with Valve or a similarly positioned company.

That said, I've been selling naked calls on this overpriced dumpster fire ;)

So what's the benefit to doing that over simply buying stock? Seems like with stock you'd still make the gains if you're right about the price going up in X months time, but you'd be able to either cash out early if you get cold feet or you can hold it for longer in hopes it recovers

You have to go to the bottom right (or settings, or the icon of a person) and scroll down to "Options." It will then give you a questionnaire asking you how much experience you have with options. In order to be approved, you HAVE to say that you have experience. Otherwise, you will be rejected. Once you answer the questions, you'll be approved, and from then on whenever you view a stock there will be a "Trade Options" button on the bottom right.

But PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE learn more about options before putting large amounts of money into them. I learned this the hard way by fooling around before truly understanding them.

Analysis, accounting, business restructuring. What do you need?
Wouldn't put anything past the CCP but  I think the play is to theaten Jack Ma and make it clear to him that there is no where in this world he and his family can hide. He will have no other option other than to cooperate.  Basically he will be a Puppet and in there back pocket at this point.  Baba will be fine but just expect a lot more China first business decisions in the future.   Making him disappear is only an option if he doesn't play ball.  I don't see that happening, he simply has to much to lose.

My understanding of the Microsoft deal was that Microsoft themselves were going to help with cloud integration and expansion of their web platform(not necessarily improving it or expanding its horizons for real digital integration), and so Microsoft would have them ready for the capability of growth and expansion utilizing their Azure services.
I misread your comment and thought you said "Is the interior triangle." I couldn't figure out what the heck you meant. 

This house was about 20 minutes from Miami proper, which used to be the sticks back then. In the 1980s Miami became big, then in the 1990s, everyone in the world became beach bums. My dad grew up down there, and he will tell you that at one point Miami was just 4 hotels...and they were tiny.

When I was kid in Destin, in the late 1990s, I couldn't believe how a house there was listed for $150,000. I would kill to have a beachfront house in Destin at that price now, since it became the new Panama City. But I can also remember growing up in Destin and there were maybe 5 or 10 beachfront hotels and it was really quiet. Like even spring break week there wasn't much to do for parties. We would drive up to Auburn to party.

Waymo is not safe nor is Tesla’s completely safe either. They make sure to tell you that so you pay attention and help teach it. Lookup the number of Waymo crashes. I think its something like 40 of their 600 cars have crashed? Either way you’re again missing the point. Go do more research—Tesla is vastly outpacing others including Waymo.

Bro, you're getting 80% returns IMMEDIATELY!  

I don't have a 401k match currently, so I'm out here investing in my IRA trying to get 20%, 30% gains.  With a match, some companies will match 100%.  It's literally the best investment in the entire market.  There is nowhere else you can go and get GUARANTEED 80-100% returns.

Bingo! Hence the loss porn you see here where people lose large amounts of money. All options at the end of the day are bets on what a stock will do. What dictates the price of each option contract is simply how safe/risky it is 

However, for example--Tesla is at 705. Say you buy a February call at a $800 strike price. If Tesla goes up to 750, you will still make a profit. If it flatlines, or goes down, then you will progressively lose more money and eventually lose it all as expiration comes. 

Options are all about change. So as long as the stock is moving in the direction you want it to, you should be alright. Its obviously much more complicated, though--i would HIGHLY advise learning more before you put a thousand into options.

DM me if you need more help, or ask here!

PDD is an interesting one. They mainly target the lower tier cities in China and are therefore not a perfect substitute for Taobao by any means. In a sense they're kinda like an amalgamation of Wish and Costco with an emphasis on group purchases. 

I honestly don't know how PDD will turn out, frankly. It depends on their strategy and whether they can actually eat into a bit of BABA's market share. Also, one of their employees just died from overwork so be careful with FD's.

realistically if you want a cool electric car, you buy a tesla.

if you want a dorky ev you buy a leaf or a bmw i3 or some shit.

people don't want dorky ev tho. except for people that are just buying for utility, and that's a tougher market to compete with gas in.

until car makers come out with "cool" electric cars tesla will command a premium.
 
for some retarded reason car makers haven't done so. I think because they are concerned about cannibalism of the existing premium products. 

but they are definitely going to be forced to go electric, because of the increase of legislation, so the question becomes, can they make a cool looking car that has good mileage/charging/cool factor?

imagine if GM produced an electric car that looked like this:

that shit would sell like hotcakes, start off a desirability factor of electric brand.

Genetic testing is a relatively cheap screening step for a ton of new medical procedures, plus the database generated from sequencing many genomes is incredibly valuable.

Yeah I’m bullish on this stock but I’m do think it’ll drop a bit more from this huge run up. That’s why I’m going to load up on puts and then once it’s done dropping I’m going to load up on long calls for it.

Will see 218 before we get back to an uptrend but you’re good, would buy the dip and get a few more contracts if we go below 220.
2020 was 7.4x growth for TSLA which means TSLA will grow 10x in 2021 AT LEAST!!!! 😤

We should be truly scared of the chinese... they got a quarter of the world, a power hungry dictator and enough capital and military presence to make shit happen
More like a flex but ok...
Commented this in another post. 

Palantir has a lot of promise moving forward for a couple of reasons. See below.

Sales team:

Essentially Palantir in the 17 years of existence, only has had a sales team for 1.5 years. The reasoning behind this is because internally, Palantir did not want to go the whole sales route of software but recently, that they needed to if they ever wanted to go public and thus reward their share holders. Since the sales team is so new, one can say that they are essentially a new company in that they are in the early years of growth. Palantir also finally has built out their Foundry Platform and Apollo platforms over the years and are now ready to ramp up a lot of customers quickly.

Efficiency / Apollo:

Palantir as a company has become extremely more efficient the past 1-2 years when it comes to acquiring new customers and ramping them up. The reasoning behind this is their Apollo Platform. It’s an in house platform that uses ML to help get a customer up and going a lot faster than previously. In the past, Palantir would have to send “forward deployed engineers” to customers to get them up and running and that could take weeks / months and is costly. Now With Apollo, Palantir can get a customer up and running in hours without sending anyone. This frees up cash for Palantir the invest back into R&D. Also wanted to mention, during the last Q3 earnings call, an analyst asked the headcount growth for the company. Most high growth companies tend to hire a lot of ppl to keep that growth rate up. A company doing that that comes to mind is Snowflake. Palantir’s CFO said that their headcount is only growing 2-3% and mostly in the sales department. The reasoning of this is directly due to Apollo. Palantir’s employees have become more efficient and that with Apollo, they can onboard a lot of customers without hiring more expensive engineers.

Palantir Modules:

On the Q3 earnings call, Palantir alluded to an ERP type Modules for Foundry that they are working on so that customers can pick and choose which aspects of Foundry they want, instead of getting the whole suite. This is great because it’s way cheaper for a company to get started with Palantir’s software and then slowly ramp up with more options. Palantir has a very high retention rate with their software so by having a company only pick 1-2 modules, it most likely will result in getting more and more modules which in turns create more revenue for PLTR. I suspect they will talk about this come the Demo day.

Final thoughts.

Palantir has great leadership and are very smart people. They are very methodical in their planning. This company is 100% a long term hold. Think 5-10 years at least. They only had a sales team for 1.5 years and already will have over $1B in sales with virtually no sales team. Just be patient.
Don’t worry guys, Jack Ma is in Radiator Springs right now... a happy place

The garage isn't counted as part of the 12k sq feet. Normally, areas outside the living space don't get included. You don't get to include pool houses and other "extras" in the square footage, but when you go to sell, you just increase the dollar per square foot. 

The garage is a second building where the bottom floor has 3 rollup doors and the top floor has recreational space, a gym, an office. That stuff gets counted in square footage.

Lol. I don’t know how many aren’t a part of FINRA because I’m not poor like you are. I don’t go searching for brokers that don’t belong to it, like the poor people have to.  You’re just upset because you don’t know that it’s not an actual law. No one is going to arrest you for it. You can’t be tried criminally for it, and they make it extremely easy to get around by having multiple brokerage accounts.  Additionally, the pdt rule ONLY applies to margin accounts, not cash accounts - but you wouldn’t know that because well, you’re retarded.  Again, you are wrong and instead of shutting the fuck up and admitting your error, you have doubled down on your retardation.  Now, go read some more Karl Marx or play call of duty, I don’t care, just stop talking as if you’re a person with a non-smooth brain

I can definitely see lobbying to knee cap us but I think it's more likely the institutions are going to do what they do best; profit.

They'll find a way to use us so they win and we win small or lose big.
Ya’ll should read about Chinese concentration camps sometimes, shit is crazy, some highlights

They have a torture room they routinely torture people in, report of a woman coming back with no fingernails and her skin flayed

They once brought everyone out, asked a girl to come forward. Made her say “I was bad but I learned Chinese so now I’m a good citizen” and then made her disrobe and took turns raping her. They payed attention to everyone reactions and any inmates who looked away or showed any sympathy towards her or anger towards the guards were taken away and never seen again
This pleas

Yes, but wages have stagnated for the most part.  In the 1970s, your wage was comparable to like 20 to 30$ an hour today.
where you going?
You think it’s going down?
Lmao
"The fact that neither Microsoft nor GameStop is trumpeting the deal, nor revealing the precise size of the revenue share even to investors, also suggests to Chukumba that there's not a significant amount of revenue involved. "If you read the press release, the sort of vague mention of revenue... if that was a big deal, you'd make that the lead. That [they didn't] makes me think it wasn't the lead..."

In Chukumba's view, Microsoft has simply traded a minuscule chunk of some Xbox digital revenue in exchange for a GameStop commitment to use Microsoft's cloud products and tablets in its stores, as announced last week. "It's going to make Microsoft as a company look much better [to shareholders] with cloud revenue from GameStop," he said."

Future headline: u/sambumlicker suspected missing
Margin is calculated daily but billed monthly, it get s added onto your margin. But understand this isn't just like taking a loan. They can say you have to have x percent of a stocks value in your account. I am currently getting screwed as they took a stock i borrowed margin to buy from 45 percent value in my account to 75 percent in a matter of 2 days. This increases the amount of money you have to have in your account in owned stock and if you suddenly don't meet the requirement they give you a few days to get it right or they start selling your shares to cover. If you happen to be underwater at that time, well it can be a big loss. TLDR its not a simple loan you pay interest on.

No, as long as you structure them correctly. Your downside is actually decreased when writing a PMCC so there’s no reason why you would need margin

This is the greatest fucking dip you could ever buy. Most Westerners don't understand jackshit about the CCP.  Yes, Jack 'disappeared'. He might get a slap on the wrist, his head shape might change- but this isn't like North Korea with Kim and his uncle. 

I don't know how institutions might view this, but if it does dip heavily, think of it as the March crash. One helluva opportunity.

They were forced to buy Tesla. And a 30% sell off isn’t massive for a company as volatile as Tesla - a 60% sell off would be considered massive. 30% is normal.
If you’re buying long positions in the stock market in this economy you are a true autist. Take your gains quickly and get out.
If one person’s an asshole, they’re an asshole.

If everyone’s an asshole, you’re an asshole.
Yet Chinese state owned and controlled companies jumped all the way to the top within a short period. It all depends on the execution.

Before or after he touched you?
The Fed will have to choose between extremely low interest rate and the printing of money or unimaginable economic pain (popping the bubble).  The Fed will choose the former because short term, it is easier of the two.  However, low interest rate and the printing of money will eventually cause another chain of reaction - exponentially growth of tech companies and hyperinflation in asset prices like real estate.  Therefore, tech companies will continue to grow and destroy more jobs and homes will become even more unaffordable.  This will lead to social unrest and violent protest.  You think things are bad now? Imagine chronic 30% unemployment, racial tension as people fight for a smaller piece of the pie.  

I do believe the dollar will continue to weaken but will massive printing of money cause the dollar to lose its reserve currency status? This depends on whether or not there is an alternative currency.  If there is one, will this lead to a shooting war? Probably not because it will a nuclear war and no one will win.  

The Fed can prop up zombie companies but it can’t  regulate big tech.  Congress needs to step in and slow them down or they will destroy jobs left and right.  However, tech companies will inevitably take over and jobs will be lost to automation and artificial intelligence not just in the US but worldwide.  

The coronavirus just sped up this eventuality by 5-10 years.
its time for ICLN to break 30.  great way to open the year
I know a couple of paper millionaires who are going to remember fast what it was like before they bought Tesla at $200 when / if the company corrects. 

You're sentiment is close to how I've played Tesla. Shorting or buying puts is ridiculous but staying long is a potential trap and I love my money too much for that. I made a third of my 2020 day and swing trading Tesla.
Right. I’m thinking of a March call. 12k in prob tomorrow. But it could reverse. But 25 looks like a floor.
If you look at the chart over the last decade you will see it traded sideways for about 6 years prior to this meteoric rise.

Stic will be $30 by the end of the year. It’s p/s ratio is 50 percent less than Chewy’s yet its revenue is growing 2x with 3x the profit margins. 

5x revenue for 2021 in a pet sector that’s booming with over 43 percent YOY growth is a fucking steal.

Ah right, of course! Everyone needs a shitty/not shitty builder designation. That would cost way less than what we do now. 

I know it’s difficult to think when you only have two synapses to connect. But without building codes, you wouldn’t be able to get people to come over to your house except at vastly higher prices and with a contract that you are liable for any injuries. So you want that huh? Say goodbye to economic activity, when people don’t go into offices to conduct business because nobody knows if the structure will collapse. To the third world with the US. I guess that’s okay with you. Everyone else be damned. Because you read Ayn Rand in high school and you’re too dumb to follow the teachings through to the inevitable conclusion. But it’s fine. You think liberty is the ability to do whatever the fuck you want. No matter how much it infringes on other people’s liberties.

No I know damn well where mm/institutions are going. They're going straight to the fuck off store to buy some stop signs. Those signs are then going to sit in their penthouse closets until Jan 15th. They're going to dig out those signs and use them to bash the idiots holding the 50,000 $30 calls into the fucking ground and then shoo off the remaining autists holding the other 80,000 OTM contracts. Then they float the price around $30 till the ADHD gets unbearable for retail and in a few months, when the autists get bored and leave, it's going to climb and never stop.

the problem with all the frontpage GME DD posts is like they take like 100 pages to lay out the EXTREMELY COMPLICATED AND CONVOLUTED bull case but the bear case can be presented in basically one paragraph:

"GME is completely fucked as digital distribution of games becomes the overwhelming majority of all game sales. GME has no recourse and is completely frozen out of the consoles, as Sony and MS own those storefronts, and is incredibly late to the game and faces very stiff competition on PC (steam, epic etc.)"

China is lifeline for Tesla from manufacturing as a market standpoint. Any new regulation by XI favoring domastic OEM and hampering Tesla’s growth will send tesla in 200-300 range pretty quick. If you can’t comprehend this fact, then I have nothing more to offer to change your mind.

One thing to note is that Elon doesn’t care about Tesla, he cares about everyone using electric cars, Tesla is only a means to an end. With almost all the major automakers publicly committing to transitioning to EV, his original goal is just about met. As such, moving forward, he is going to focus less and less on Tesla, and more on SpaceX/Mars. Once Tesla is sustainably profitable he will go hands off. He’s not going to attempt to make Tesla super profitable or worry about creating “shareholder value”. So the risk of him continuing to super innovate at Tesla in the long term is small.

Been in corn since 380. Took some profits along the way, now holding for the year or until it starts going down. If China keeps buying US corn and planting remains low, due to higher soybean prices, the corn price can keep going up. Main risk is another US China tariff spat. Let's hope Biden and Xi become good friends.

sigh apple gonna continue tanking.
To get a cheaper price. This happens regularly with big institutions. It's how they manipulate the market. Also they are upset that PLTR didn't go the traditional IPO route and they (MS) missed out on discounted or early stock options.
How many fingers do you think Jack Ma has left at this point

I don't lie:

>With this new agreement, Democratic members of Congress and President  Obama have permanently set tax rates—in the sense that the rates don’t  expire, not that future Congresses can’t change them—at [extraordinarily low levels by historical standards](http://www.taxpolicycenter.org/taxfacts/displayafact.cfm?Docid=543).  Short of major revenue increases, projected general revenue  consequently will grossly underfund government services and investments;  relative to a current law baseline (in which the tax cuts would have  expired), passing the income tax rate cuts will lead to $3.2 trillion in  lost revenue over a decade, [according to Citizens for Tax Justice](http://ctj.org/pdf/bidenmcconnelldeal.pdf).

Yep, at any moment a stock and can lose 10% of its share price and make a heavy green call into red. Depends on the stock but selling after it goes up $5 or 5-10% of the strike price, is a good time to secure profits. And if you have a hunch stock is going to plummet, forcing yourself to cut losses is good too.

China is 95% calorie independent (old-ish statistic...), that means 5% calorie deficit (times 1.4 billion people), and it's hugely protein deficient which is why it buys soy like a madman.

USA is one of the few protein and calorie positive countries, if there's any area besides the military that USA absolutely dominates in, it's agriculture.

China has been trying to get what it needs from SA recently, but la nina is making that difficult as crop yields in SA are going down due to dry weather.

I think in Q3 we're going to see some huge numbers from our brave american farmfolk, especially if Biden uses agri tariffs as a bargaining chip early. I'm long on deere for this reason as well as rocketing lumber prices.

It’s easier to make all kinds of bets today, that’s for sure. Despite that, we’ve had some periods lately when the ratio of bullish bets to bearish bets gets really high. I think the biggest problem is that leverage is way too easy to get your hands on

Thanks for the outstanding write up! One thing I would add that I have been worried about. In the event the shorts manage a closed doors deal with enough institutional share holder to close out their short positions without having to go onto the open market, that would remove the possibility of a squeeze and any holder in GME for that would likely sell to close, sending prices tumbling.. let’s hope it doesn’t come to that! 🍻

I believe the degree to which shorts / bears of all experience and income levels have access to short bets not, vs in 1999, has made the market's pricing machine more effective, aka sustained bubbles are less likely to pop, rather than just uncomfortably inflate and then dampen. 

Given who and how many people are buying stonks / options right now, this bull has some different characteristics than 1999 which actually make it safer, imho.

TIME TO CONQUER
Was seriously wondering when anyone would mention corn
Eh, you’d be surprised how much I’ve spent on my homies weddings. 

We have a rule with my close homies that the groom pays for nothing during bachelor week and weddings are expensive AF. 

But I get it, if they charging you to go it’s lame. I also know anything but an open bar is lame, but everyone has their own budget. 

On the flip, when I got wifed up, we eloped because we thought it was silly to spend the money and instead spent it on real estate.

Republicans will win easily, the news are really wrong as usual.  Georgia went barely blue with lots of split ticket votes against Trump and an historic get out the vote against Trump on the left.  Both Loeffler and Perdue lost votes to third candidates.   Betting on a 53/46 for Perdue and a 51/48 for Loeffler

I'm lib as fuck, I don't want them to win, but this is all so silly

Bed time and closing thoughts. Futes don't matter. AM is dumping into dip buying. Overbought tech n green energy most vulnerable. Senate race hopes might keep solar and shit steady of going up tho.

R Win = Big tech back to mooning and probably a nice jump for XLE stocks, especially if OIL is up. Green energy profit taking

D Win = Green energy moon, and probably steel related shit. Big tech drills NQ weak. Energy sector probably dumps.

Technically, it gets added to your actual income. So they can tax you even more. So if you make 40k at your day job a year, and make 20k from day trading, you get taxed at a 60k bracket. I wish they taxed day trades separate.

Total. If you make $5k on a trade, and lose $3k 15 minutes later, like everyone here does, then you have $2k in gains you need to pay taxes on (until you lose another $2k).
You realize the a very large chunk of the world could say the same about the US right? Every world power violates Human Rights. If I invest in clean energy and EVs in China am I not still helping a greener future? Things are more complicated than surface level patriotism and nationalism.

You’re either stubborn or haven’t done your research to think Waymo or GM (good work they did with NKLA right?) have anything close to competing with Tesla. Waymo’s system has had plenty of accidents and only operates in a sub-sector of one city while Teslas drive and record data from all over the world. I recommend you actually drive each vehicle or at least watch videos of each from 2018, 2019, and 2020. Tesla continues to exponentially improve, Waymo has stagnated and had funding cut...and GM isn’t even a player.

When the BABA news first broke someone here actually made a smart comment; use China's response to BABA to decide how to deal with all Chinese stocks.

If they slap Ma on the wrist and fine the company then China is safe to invest in. If they nationalize the company and Ma is last seen in a re-education camp then it's time to fire sell Chinese holdings. What China will do probably won't fall to either extreme but the point is still there.

Yes, but palantr's software requires a LOT of upkeep to the point that they created a cloud service to manage all of their customers solutions.  This is the big question about are they a product company or a services company.  Seems like a services company and in that case their margins are gonna be slim unless every single security firm, police department, and government in america is connected. 

But then again, no one else is doing palintr's work, so they have first movers advantage.  expect that to get touched over the next decade...

I have an iron condor that profits if Tesla stays between 600 and 800 by 1/15. That is what my money is on. I think you’re missing the point that s&p inclusion brought in forced buyers at a stupidly high level and yet people are still holding shorts and buying more shorts. Now there is even less float (the s&p holders aren’t going to sell nor are the TSLA fanboys for that matter) for shorts to work with. Their next big product gets better every week if you keep up with the FSD videos. It is improving exponentially all while Tesla expands new factories worldwide still while profiting. Not to mention they have enough demand they still have no need to advertise—a large number of people still don’t even know Tesla exists. I talk to people like that all the time and it amazes me the bubbles we all live in.
I'd wear it if it has just the rocket and wsb logo..might broaden your market. Disclaimer. I respect everyone's decision to own GME. 🚀🚀🚀

On what grounds. Because out of all their segments, phone make up the most revenue?

What about macs, tablets, AirPods, ipods, HomePods, services, Apple TV - all those make up the other 50% of revenue. If phone were to go away, Apple still makes $120B from their other products. How much does Tesla make from solar panels?

Another good point. My thought is let’s see how fast the back to work shift happens. Not many people itching to buy new cars or caring about Long range when they are either working from home permanently or a few days a week. I don’t see that changing anytime soon. The question is, how much range do you really need? 

But let’s get away from their cars. Automotive market share will never warrant a big valuation, it’s proven to be a saturated, lower margin business. What else is Tesla doing to justify their current valuation.

You seem to be comparing hedge funds to index mutual funds.  I was simply comparing index mutual funds and ETFs to actively managed counterparts.  
While I am aware of the advantages of a hedge fund, I believe there is a significant minimum investment required which, along with the elevated risk profile of a hedge fund, would make that option unavailable to most of us.

I watched maybe every single interview with Alex karp and Peter thiel that was available. And their focus really is not all out growth. It's been in gestation for almost 2 decades at this point. This is a slow burn stock. Also the nature of their business is hard to scale. One of their main focuses is keeping people employed and using people in the place of programs. But that makes margins thinner. Overall I like the company, I like what it stands for, but I just don't think that this is a company that can scale to be massive anytime soon sadly. It's hard for me to go point by point without this being a few thousand words.

Car companies can switch to making EVs and are doing so in droves. However, TSLA’s biggest competitive advantage is its super charger network. Nothing else comes even close in America and won’t come close until at least 5 years from now.

Range anxiety is a real thing with EVs and people won’t switch over in droves until there is a real solution that problem. Only company offering that is TSLA.

For all those asking the same question:
dem sweep -> more fiscal spending -> higher inflation -> higher interest rates -> lower preference for cash flows produced far into the future (bc not worth as much at higher discount rates) -> non-profitable tech companies sell off -> Nasdaq futes red

Remember when Cramer read that meme comment on CNBC about “Jack Ma please tell Winnie the Pooh you’re sorry” 

Top tier TV moment
That’s basically luxury condos. Shoeboxes.

I doubt it though. As transportation becomes electrified and super cheap and stuff like Hyerloop comes online and WFH becomes more widespread, housing will rise in less dense areas and you’ll get more LAs with lots of sprawl but commuting isn’t as bad. This doesn’t mean city centers will have pricing cuts though, because being at the core still has value compared to commuting 15 mins for 100 km.

>You’re an actual idiot. My first comment was saying that PLTR was a DPO, not an IPO.

I read it. It doesn't matter. SPAC, DPO, IPO or any other way it wouldn't have mattered. I looked at it and thought, "Oh, this guy has no idea what's going on, and is going to be right on some random insignificant point" because what does that have to do with being able to actually invest in private companies? Nothing.

>What the fuck are you on about?

The ability to invest in private companies. The actual topic posed by the OP.

>I could give a shit about whether I bought prior to debut when I’ve made money in the end, thanks for calling me poor.

Well, I can tell that you are both poor and stupid because fundamentally you responded to a technical question with a non-point with the intent to ... well whatever it is you think is worth doing. 

> Let’s see your positions before you start acting like Warren Buffet.

Oh god, here we go again with the troglodyte "show me your dick" thing. Look, I don't want to know your portfolio. I think it's better that we leave the divide the way it is.

>All talk, no profits.

If your profits are stated in percentages it rarely makes them material. In my time I find that people who are actually making a lot of money, esp. if they are poorer, talk in percentiles or in relative sums of money to their earnings. 

> Just another WSB retard from the looks of it.

Easiest way to obtain pre-ipo stocks (this is not buying stocks at IPO, pre-ipo like spacex, stripe etc..)  is to become an accredited investor and SEC recently made a change where you can become one by passing Series 65 exam (fee is $175 and does not require sponsorship unlike Series 7). Also, there no need for $1M in assets or $200k annual salary if you pass the exam.

>And that's not a myth or misconception. 

It's absolutely a misconception. Every major tech company (eg Apple, Samsung, Sony and Microsoft) relies on Chinese manufacturing for some components of their final products, and if they care about the quality they'll do business with plants that actually achieve their desired QA.

Reality is most consumers just care more about something being cheap than being good, and companies just go with the cheapest manufacturing option and get what they pay for.
Love the ending lmao!

In my limited view Yes, but before that they have a massive opportunity. The biggest challenge in AI and big data industry is the scale up of successful pilots. Think in terms of EV prototype vs mass market production.
Palantir scores best when it comes to potential to scale-up and speed to market, no company and i mean no company can beat them. But they are also the most expansive solution in town also, which is OK.
The challenge is we are so used to of working in web of enterprise software, so to decide and leave all of it to move to one dedicated platform for a company is a big commitment. Companies do it when the value is clear and above the competition. This is why acquiring customers is difficult but retaining customer is higher probability
it's a sign of a company that can set on exponential growth

WFH is mainly for tech jobs. You know where most of the tech centres are and their employees live? Urban centres. No one’s coding and taking Zoom calls in rural farmland with dial-up connection...

People are leaving SF and LA to Austin, not rural, Texas. 

If housing goes up in the suburbs or less dense areas, it will be neighboring areas but this won’t drive prices down in the urban centers. If you disagree, please show me one example of a major housing price crash or even downward trend in any major city. I’m not being rhetorical either, I want to be shown wrong.

Sad thing is though, this is a pure equity appreciation play and not income unless you go into REITs, so doesn’t mean much for people wanting to actually live in the city.

You said it yourself, where are people going to go to protect their nest eggs? Real estate. Housing always goes up, this is the law.

China, under President Xi Jinping, has been ruthless against its critics and has unleashed a drive to arrest all the dissidents of the regime. In March a property tycoon had disappeared after he called President Xi Jinping a ‘clown’ for his handling of the coronavirus crisis. Ren Zhiqiang a billionaire financier, was sentenced to 18 years in prison after he ‘voluntarily and truthfully confessed’ to various crimes of corruption.

open??? are you hallucinating again?
lmfao you're delusional
Some do, some don't beat it. It also heavily depends on the measuring points. Usually at the ATH of some particular index it seems that it's so much better than any hedge fund manager. But you could say that about a brick of gold when it's at ATH. Fees, on the other hand, are very much a factor. No ETF will charge you 25% of all profits. Also, it's so much easier to just login to your broker and buy into ETF, compared to investing in non-public managed funds. But actively managed funds have few big advantages: 
1) they can make deals outside of the public market, including negotiating lucrative prices;
2) they can own private companies;
3) they can buy other types of assets, including land, property, bonds etc;
4) they can rearrange capital helping struggling businesses;
5) they can be activist investors, influencing the board and management.

And yeah he is your president unless your not an American citizen.  Unless you give up your citizenship he is your president.  Just like Obama and bush were yours and my presidents, just like Biden is going to be our next president.

Competence is knowing when you actually have a knowledge edge and when you’re out of your depth. Blindly buying PLTR because you see memes is also conscious incompetence...

I’m glad you’re confident that a company that has never received FDA approval for a drug will complete a 5-10 year long process to get their therapy approved, and then have such a superior product to the other companies, who are far ahead in the approval process, for the same therapy that they take market share... This is also a curative therapy, so being first to market is huge. You obviously have tons of experience investing in pharma companies and understand translational medicine, FDA approval processes, and the immense amount of uncertainty in bringing a drug that works in human CELLS to actual human bodies. 

ARKG is run by people who spend their time actually understanding the above and give capital proportionally to those companies they think will be long-term winners. They’re giving much more capital/weight to the direct competitors to EDIT, so you’re betting that you know more than they do... Good luck with your investing! If you’re just planning on sitting on these shares and won’t gauge your eyes out when you see huge volatility in the next few years, then it’s not a totally crazy investment, but you should know that the odds are not on your side...
So you're confirming that 1) you were able to buy it when it went public and you'd have been fine (which is what I said) and 2) that you don't know anything about sophisticated investing? I am not following your point.

I saw Bill Ackman at a grocery store in Los Angeles yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.

If you hold commons for more than a year prior to sale, any gainz you accumulate are taxed at a different (lesser) tax rate and not taxed purely as income.

But you have to hold for a year for your gainz to be considered "long-term" so there is additional risk if your pick tanks.

Hi its me jack ma
Amazon has held up well and continue to flourish. And Tesla was overpriced in June. It went up another $300B from selling EV credits to turn a small profit. That’s why you need to be careful about meme stocks, they can just continue to go up and up (Zoom, OSTK) until they don’t anymore.

Don't let people belittle you, everyone learns the same thing whether it was in their twenties or their thirties, and sometimes never at all. My parents never taught me this stuff either so until semi recently I was actually super stoked to have gotten 50k together into a savings account.

Musk openly criticizes government (for example, calling Covid lockdowns fascist) and his companies continue to thrive, one joining the S&P just months later, and others continuing to secure government contracts.

>I didn’t understand anything you just said...

Which is normal here.

>and PLTR was a DPO not IPO

Which makes you even less likely to be a candidate if they didn't use 506b.

ANYWAY, If you had bought when it hit market you'd have made about the same amount of money for most of these offerings no matter the method. Very few were something you would ever have been approached about to invest in them before going public and this would have had to have happened (lit.) years ago. Like AirBnB would have been over a decade old before you saw this as a possibility.

One way or the other you are definitely too poor and stupid. :(

Could it be that index funds have become popular because active managers do not (in the long run) beat the benchmark indexes and charge higher fees for sub par returns?
That’s not a good thing. This means the companies in indices get propped up like zombies. Sunrise Land has been buying equities for years now with very little to show for it. Purchasing securities is probably the least effective way to stimulate economic activity.

Worst part of buying equities is that they can’t naturally roll off the balance sheet either.

Wait what? I save over $1k every paycheck at 22 years old, as do pretty much all of my college friends.  We all graduated from public universities, in the middle of the pandemic, do not work in high-earning cities (ie LA, SF, NYC), and have all moved out of our (middle-class) parents' houses (except 1).  I am a bottom-half earner among my friend group, mainly because I took a cushier career path with a lower-earning path, and am still able to save 2k a month while having enough leftover money to throw away into OTM option plays.  

This shit is not tough, we are all borderline retarded, but put in some effort at school/networking, thought about the value of our majors for more than 10 minutes, and spent some extra time networking and furthering education beyond school/work.  If you can't put down 60k in 5 years at 29, maybe it's time to re-evaluate some priorities.

So the fed can’t own market stock, bonds commodities whatever they are doing to make money and basically do their part to help make the deficit worse than it already is. 

So like I picture it the fed being the real Robinhood, taking money and giving it to the government to use it. Which seems like a smart play instead of printing the $ as the only thing happening. And this lady wants to stop that so the fed it only printing money and they can’t own stocks or whatever to help reduce the deficit. Am I understanding this correctly?

For real?
The comment was about how there were 13% government secured bonds for everyone a few decades ago but there aren't anymore.

The previous poster who has since deleted their post linked a bond that was 13% decades ago trying to prove the comment wrong. But when you actually went and looked at the bond they were linking it proves the comment right, that the bonds that were 13% decades ago are not any more.

That some overly rich pricks who can't find enough good investments can accept a small loss doesn't matter. I think it's amother good argument for the original comment. Shits fucked.

[Educational Resource.](https://www.accreditedinvestorleads.com/accredited-vs-sophisticated/) No, you need to be a *Sophisticated Investor*. An Accredited Investor is very different and simply based on your income and likelihood of continued income at a certain level by which you can simply "allow" yourself into the door. Accredited Investors are all Sophisticated Investors but not all Sophisticated Investors are Accredited.

Accurate af
If you're planning on staying in the area it might be worth it. Our interest is 2.7%. In 5 years savings accounts will likely be higher than that. We moved in December last year, got reappraised this year and the value went from $305k to 340k. Builder announced the last phase will get upwards of 15 to 20% price increases for this summer.

Sure we could bottom out again like in 08 but I highly doubt it. If your job and life is stable then fuck renting.
You’ll own those calls maybe a week. But the new Sham-wow, years.

What calls should I buy?
Holding onto 50 percent gain during the middle of the pandemic is quite good. My portfolio would be a lot higher if the pandemic was over. QQQ had a history of poor performances and only had a recent rally. A correction is due. Also SPY never went anywhere near 50 percent in the last 3 years, stop lying.

This is my take:

-	Market ETFs are good long-term investments.  They will burst but return to normal over time. 

-	Sectors running hot (EV, Genomics, etc) will burst. While the **sector** benefits long-term from the cash influx and should recover, certain companies (the zombies) will not. But those that do will achieve Amazon like growth.  You might be able to guess at who these companies are to remain by how well management is reinvesting in growth. 

-	Sectors that continue to keep good fundamentals (Retail - WMT/Tgt, etc) will fall during the burst but return to normal. Safe long term. 

How you treat it is up to your risk profile. You can play EV and get massive returns but you need to sell before the bubble pops.

Personally I keep all retirement funds in S&P 500 ETFs, a few “safe” stocks (Ex Amazon), and then my play money is chasing the hot sector growth hoping I can get out in time.  This is also why when I win with play money the profit goes back into safe stocks.
Both same time. Or get you a crazy gen z bitch with half of each.

NIO week
You have to be an accredited investor (net worth of \~1mil or proof of 200k+ yearly income) for any pre-ipo investing sites like equityzen, fundersclub, etc. And the 15-20k minimum investment is typical for most companies on those sites, tho that can vary by company. For example, SpaceX is 50-100k minimum right now.

Stick with it through opening 4 hours. It’s linear until then. Game opens up well. Enjoying it a lot. It’s fire.
I bought a truckload of $AAPL calls and held through split ER and made a year salary. Every other time, if I did not sell right at open, they burned even if it went up.  

Can't do bull spreads, to small of money and fear of assignment.  

SAFE- Shares and sell during the spike on runup. If no spike, hold and sell AH/PM if it spikes. That means you need an account that trades during those hours.  

Risky but MAX GAIN- 1/15 24c, catch the IV during the week, and get out as it runs up, even if it heading into close on Wed. But do not hold past ER. I don't believe shorts will hold into ER.  

Also, paid stock upgrades are starting to drip, leading me to believe it is possible shorts will try to cover tomorrow. Watch volume at open. If it increases and the price still drops to 12-16, you will know there will be no squeeze. They need to be caught off guard and be trapped after open.  

Good luck with whatever you do. Sometimes just a small position is enough to feel like you a part of it too, as the losses can be severe.

Sounds bullish to me. Honestly I have an iron condor set from 600 to 800. You’re nuts if you think its going below 600 anytime soon. The average price paid per share is now ~620 thanks to the S&P tards having to buy in all the way up to 695.

Optionprofitcalculator will help you toy with some spreads. Debit spreads are buying the more expensive call and selling a less expensive call against it. If you have an AAPL debit spread for 134/135 1/08, you might have spent .35 for it. To break even, you need the price of AAPL to reach at least 134.35 by expiry. To receive the entire 1.00 profit per spread, AAPL must finish the week above 135. Buy as many as you want, 3x your money. Hold them through ER without worrying about IV crush.

After i realized what i just said i said wait no no no and she just had a smirk and moved on
I have also been thinking about this.  If there is another crisis, I believe: 

1) Fed will come in and buy stocks in these zombie companies and their debt to stabilize them and thereby, protecting jobs, retirement funds and pension funds.  This will lead to misallocation of resources.  

2) The bubble is too big for the Fed to pop.  The Fed will choose hyperinflation over economic pain.  Low interest rate won’t be enough.  The Fed will need to print more money. 

3) Hyperinflation and record low interest rate means there is going to a rush for hard assets like real estate.  

4) Investors will avoid these zombie companies.  Low interest rate and inflation means they will make jack in bonds.  They will have no choice but to keep on investing in growth companies (tech). 

5) With a flush of cash from investors, low interest rate and high valuation, these tech companies will grow exponentially and invest heavily in automation/AI.  By making the economy more efficient, more jobs will be destroyed (think Amazon).  

6) The Fed will then realize popping these zombie companies won’t work anymore because tech companies have grown exponentially and are destroying jobs left and right.  

7) The Fed will have no choice but to make it rain with helicopter money which will be a precursor to universal basic income.  

My playbook:
- invest in rental properties (hard asset with a nice monthly dividend) 
- buy Chinese stocks 

Have a good new year everyone.  Hope this post won’t become a reality.

You didn't need a pre-IPO for Palantir of most of them actually. Also, to even begin to do that you would have to be a Sophisticated Investor so, cash be damned, you're probably too stupid. Or at least the SEC thinks you are. And they are probably right. No offense.

Rich pay less taxes per dollar then anyone else.

Rich people own more wealth than humanly sizeable, of course even if they paid 1% in taxes you could still say 99% of taxes are paid by the rich.

Doesn't mean poor people don't end up paying more % of their wealth than rich people and that economy is not actively designed to keep rich richer and poor poorer.
I do believe. We will find out in the next 3x years who was right.

I actually don't think PLTR are bad people and I probably wouldn't invest if I did. I don't hold or trade or entertain any positions in defense. Same is true for oil.

PLTR works with both of those industries, likely because they are some of the most historically bloated industries in the world. Decades of no bid contracts, anti competition, govt subsidies, and political protections have enabled wasteful spending & gluttonous dividends. These habits protect complacency within hiring and management hierarchies and created a near perfect entry for papa Thiel and Alex Karp.

PLTR is just an enterprise data OS, but they get a bad wrap because of the aforementioned terry hunting and outspoken usage of big data. MSFT & GOOG & AAPL all do similar stuff with data, but they aren't "mysterious" systems explicitly linked to profiting from killing terrys. They are simply more understood by the average consumer, and create the illusion of data privacy protections between systems.

I think PLTR is a good platform because at the core it's an efficiency platform. Yes it has fancy tech and software but it seems to do three things very well:

\- simplify the software stack

\- create business intelligence analysts from workforces with low technical skills

\- deploy engineers who enable rapid setup and user onboarding
If Washington wins, they get a lower pick than the Cowboys. That would be incentive enough...

Then you’ve got Alex Smith, after all that he went through, how the fuck can you not root for him???

Ron Rivera too....and they don’t even have a team name.

Chinese way of dealing with dissidents is by getting people that are remotely as far off as possible, this is to prevent any sympathy or empathy from forming. Same reason they got a battalion from Guang Zhou PLA(Southern Chinese) to go fuck up Uyghurs in Xinjiang(Northern minorities). Same thing happened in 8964 Tiananmen, because the Beijing PLA refused to kill the students so they had to get the outskirts PLA to do it. I am actually not surprised if they got a Cantonese PLA soldier to torture him

Elon diamond hands all his shares and buys calls to manipulate it up with his buddies. 

48 billion lost by shorts this year, now TSLA has 20 billion on hand.. Don't forget Elon himself admitted Tesla margins are like 1%. Shorts, not revenue, is feeding Tesla ventures.

Not to mention he sold hats, flamethrowers, pants, tequila... all sells out immediately. 

That guy is a financial genius do not fight him.

SEC is asleep. Today's market is rampant manipulation and insider trading.

Not to mention Cathy will buy every time TSLA craters and that lady has more money under her control every day...

Who knows, you can keep buying 25% otm puts every week and see if you hit it this year.

Just saw Jack Ma at a grocery store in Los Angeles. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.

He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?

I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.

The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.

When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly

We are talking about stock options, which are a way to profit off of fluctuations in a stock. You buy calls if you think a stock will go up, and puts if you think itll go down. 

This year, Tesla has been rocketing: and as such, people who bought calls (bulls) profited a ton while put holders  (bears) lost money. Timing the Tesla drop with puts will be very profitable

I agree for the most part. Dunno how those new "luxury" apts popping up in major cities will fare going forward. Anyway, especially with the transition to Everything as a Service, it seems like a safe investment going forward. See these two videos below:

[https://youtu.be/3-saxnxpbWE](https://youtu.be/3-saxnxpbWE)

[https://youtu.be/TPtA38Bcy08](https://youtu.be/TPtA38Bcy08)

tldw: the price and time benefits for employers and employees by remote work will drive further urban sprawl and the repopulation of abandoned towns/cities - but most Americans still won't be able to afford a home, nevermind move to these new emerging towns; thus, the second video is what I imagine the reality will be in most cases.

Totally agree with this and had this exact same thought yesterday (great minds think alike). And it very well could happen, and frankly the market is already pricing in that this is going to happen. So if it doesn’t, or they can’t execute, then the Tesla story doesn’t look so bright. That’s what I’m saying here, the market is pricing Tesla for greatness but all we’ve seen is autonomous software that is just okay (not market leading) and really nice cars with abysmal quality ratings and constant issues. The posibillities make it a $700B company now, but the timing for the possibilities need to come to fruition sooner than later.

Thanks for your detailed answer.
Dem run senate means more money. More money means more pumping of the stock market. I don’t see how this is a negative. 

If republicans win then there’s no more stimulus since Mitch will block it to infinity, renters get evicted, homeowners lose income and can’t pay their mortgage, people lose their jobs and we get fucked. 

Corporate tax increases wouldn’t be great but giving people confidence that their government will actually take care of them in case of disaster will allow them to spend more and drive GDP growth. 

Republican win just means that we’ll forgo long-term sustainable growth for short-term bullshit that will likely blow up in our face. Then, when it does, they can blame Biden and claim Dems are bad for the stock market. Rinse and repeat

(For the record I despise the r/politics crowd sometimes even more than the r/conservative crowd. That shit is an echo-chamber of people jerking themselves off that they are morally perfect. But the solution seems obvious here IMO)

EPS seems to differ from one source to the next. PE of $3 would be tight. Ameritrade shows PE of $466. Marketwatch shows PE of $.56. Finviz shows PE of $259. 

It depends partially on the EPS used (trailing 12 months or forward 12 months).

Apologies for the condescension as I typically assume everything on Robinhood to be incorrect, but it appears to be very different between sources.

Having said that, my options are i) I average down; or ii) sell covered calls above $50.

**None**, of the headlines mention the fact that burning gasoline killed seven people. **None,** of the headlines mentioned a Ford F-150 crashed.

Every time a Tesla battery ignites hours after a wreck, news stories run for days with headlines like "Tesla battery flamethrower burns car in crash." 

Tesla has international pressure trying to cause it to fail at every turn. It went up 700%.

Well if they dominate the market with their EVs then they CAN become like a tech company and just as profitable. Imagine 5-10 years Tesla positions itself to maximize the amount of time people spend in their cars, and they essentially create an eco-system with their cars like apple with their phones. They could take some market share from Amazon by allowing owners to use their cars as a delivery vehicle or taxi, they could also ram up the screen in the car to include bunch of apps that u can use when on park, link it with ur phone (or neural link).. lot of shit can happen, or maybe none of this happens but the fact that idiots like me can speculate about it will probably keep the share price high for years to come

Your probabilities of a streak continuing are definitely wrong. If a stock goes up 8 days in a row, it doesn’t go down on the 9th day 99.7% of the time. It’s pretty much 49-50% and anything else is probably just randomness caused by small sample size.

It's kinda like machine learning and data bases and finding relationships in data in a world that is producing exponential data creation.

So picture the Boston Bomber manhunt, but more like a CIA case. They're feeding all this data into a data base. Annotated photos. People of interest. Money transactions. All sorts of good stuff. It's way too much data for anyone to reasonably go through on their own.

So out of 10,000 pieces of data, you manually connect two of them. Person A is connected to Person B because they're brothers. Person A and B are both from the same country. That's another connection. And so a spider web grows with all these connections.

You feed in a photo to the database. It's Person A and another mystery person with blues eyes.

Someone else loads in an audio transcript where Person A says, "Damn, I can't turn down that blue eyes" 

The program will find that two references about blue eyes and connects them. Maybe you should get more data on Person C? They could give you more info into where Person A and B are.

So it's like a sexy spy cop thriller movie, but way less sexy and not nearly enough red string on the cork board.

Yep, that’s the big question. It’s at 23.72 right now, and I bought at 26. So if I load down another few hundred on stocks, around that price I should get to around $24 overall. Then I guess wait to see for this month and next. If it doesn’t do good by March...we’re gonna be waiting awhile. But it’ll probably dip again regardless in March. Then go up again after. I guess I’ll see in the morning how this thing moves.
And you’ll be the retard when you lose $49K the next day.

> Realistically speaking, do you see tsla dropping 50% or more? 

Yes.

> Tesla may consider licensing its battery and self driving tech.

I don't think car companies are jumping to license tech from Tesla when there are other companies like Mobileye with a better track record of not overpromising and underdelivering but actually just delivering what they have. Also, they don't have the stupid bias against lidar that Elon seems to have just because Mobileye fired them as a client.

Licensing battery tech? I don't think they need to, because sales numbers already speak for themself. They don't need Tesla battery tech because people are already buying the EVs even though the range might be a little bit less. Perfect is not a requirement to beat Tesla.

Market swings.  It lost to 25% to manipulation/EOY sell offs (profit capture)/paper hands the last week.  It wasn't due to anything in particular with the company itself.  Its strong DD is intact.  Frankly, the EOY calls expired and the institutions shouldn't be very interested in selling off their ownership now...  so, up it goes.
You could have literally just bought pure SPY or QQQ and been up FAR more then 50% over three years

Is traditional investing frowned upon here? I have been involved in financial securities for the past 7 years. I started off going the traditional investing route. The profits were good. I figured I tried to make big money by making big bets through short term trading and like all you I lost most of my money. I went back into the traditional investing route, buying undervalued growth stocks with good company financials and low debt. I haven't lost money in three years. My portfolio is up 50 percent in three years. What do you guys think of traditional investing? Would you ever try traditional investing?

If you're not committed to being right in the middle of everything, highly recommend looking around Ellicott City or a little further west. Convenience of shopping all around you, nice scenery, pretty much get anywhere you need to be in under 30 minutes.  (Lived in Maryland for 20 years)

You don't understand how puts get covered when you're short shares, do you? It's the opposite of a covered call. There's no downside risk.
wtf does selling for profits mean?
Well if the S&P500 committee is forward looking they poured hard over those books and made that decision. Lots of companies go way up in a year and then fade and don't get into the S&P500 and it isn't an automatic entry either; in fact Tesla got denied the first time in 2020, so something else is out there that is known.

Just don't get too cocksure. You're betting against a lot of heavy professionals and sure, 2020 was a weird year, and don't take this the wrong way, but it probably won't happen twice. Retail got to ride lightning and it was sweet but...

If you can be a little patient you’ll find that not everyone getting out of their home will take the top bid.   When buying my home I took the time to write a letter to the owners at the time explaining who I was, who my girlfriend was, why we loved the home, what our plans for it were, etc.  I know we weren’t the top bid but we got the house anyway.  

But, this was the 4th time doing that.  The other three still took a bid higher than ours.  

So again, it will still likely take time but you would be surprised how many people feel sentimental about their home and want to know it’s in good hands.

Guess I’m gonna hold my few shares of PLTR for now. Not sure whether to buy more tomorrow at its low, and just hold on till end of year. Seems like a long term thing now, as I bought in at 26. I can only predict it goes up January/February before lock up. Or wait till end of year for the long haul on this. Still have some buying power...maybe buy some dips on other stocks I have my eye on. Or go deep on PLTR while it’s down 🤷🏻‍♂️

7 yrs ago I was pregnant and my husband lived homeless for 4 months while he went through school, with the last of our savings he flew me across the country to stay with family. We are now 28, will pay off our house in 9 months (yes its small but it's nice) and easily put 10k+ a year in savings while having 2 kids. 

There was plenty of days he worked at 6am and wasnt home till 9pm because he had school after work. He grew up with a single mom who died from cancer 6 yrs ago, no dad, and I grew up with parents who live paycheck to paycheck. Not everyone who lives comfortable grew up rich, sometimes it's hard work.

Let's say you set aside a goal to save 60k in 5 years, thats 60 months, you'd have to save and not touch, 1,000 a month.

I dont think many 24 year olds can even make that much money to afford to live on their own and save a grand a month.

Even at 29 I was only making 30k a year pretax, and that was the first year I ever made over 28k.

I remember from 2008-2012 I didnt even get a raise. Think I made 10.50 an hour for three years before I got a .50 raise.  I think at 24 I made 11 an hour, as I went on salary at 25k but had to work a minimum of 50 hours with no overtime.

It all kinda bleeds together. Just too much work, getting taken advantage for years.  

It took years to get out of that poverty mindset.

>It’s genuinely good that companies like Tesla will get allocation of billions and billions which they (frankly) do not quite deserve at current fundamentals. This will accelerate their growth. The bad thing is that such allocations cement big tech monopolies, damaging competition. And it also provides liquidity to zombie companies big enough to make it into indexes.

Forgive me if I misunderstand, but are you under the impression that inflows into index funds are being allocated to these companies? Unless the companies are issuing new shares, the companies are not receiving a dime when fund managers purchase their stock on the open market.

Bruh if you sell to open any options, you're paid money right then and there. There's generally a buying power reduction since you can lose more than the credit you collected. 

That said,  you need to consider assignment risk and after-hours risk. People can decide to exercise for up to 90 minutes after market close on expiry. Could blow up in your face and get even worse over the weekend.

If you ask me, tesla is a car company for now and in the next 5 years since 85% of its revenue is from autosales. I do think tesla may be crushed by VW and BYD. But i also think may grow into its valuation, so really the hype is what that is carrying its current share price. When will be hype stop? When the company posts its first quarterly loss? Maybe. I think at that point, tesla may consider licensing its battery and self driving tech. Realistically speaking, do you see tsla dropping 50% or more? You have every father and mother and grandma buying every dip. Except me.
Correct, he is no way implying options in the post. He is however implying options on indexes in his comment reply to you when he said that FDs on SPY were once common. But I agree this post is kind of pointless and not super enlightening,

You have to call your broker and tell them your contract is terminated, but you have to call exactly at the time of expiration or they charge you 120 percent of the premium

Damn congrats. I bought a 245/240 call spread towards eod on Thursday thinking that might be the bottom. I can’t see why everyone would sell right away especially if it was way higher just a week ago. Just to be safe though I went pretty far itm. Starting to think it might not have been the best decision
Nobody ever got rich spending all their money. Max out your 401k and ira. It’s pre tax and you won’t even notice it missing. Do that for a few years and it really starts to add up.

Selling a call you receive the premium when you open the position.  If the call expires ITM you will be obligated to sell 100 shares of the underlying at the strike price.
Is BABA mooning? Is Jack Ma still alive? 

You know which question matters to me.
You didn’t see the premium in your account?
positions? And what stocks? That’s rlly cool. Stats in UG?

What is that?
I can't tell you how to do better. I can only tell you about the choices I made to get where I'm at, to include the ones that set me back. It's easy to say "oh, just retrace my steps!" without considering your background, beliefs, strengths, disorders, and so on - which is basically what I did (with the assumption that someone reading my post falls into a demographic and mindset that would allow them to consider my approach).  

I joined the military out of high school. I've spent the last ten or so years flying solo, saving up cash and investing it passively into the market. I probably put away half my income - which wasn't a lot for most of the ride - over the years. I could have earned a masters degree at little cost just as I could have gotten out after four years, started up a family, and sacked my net worth.  

I'm not saying that my route is what people should have to go through or that societies' failings could be solved "if only people followed my route" - just that it worked for me, it didn't have a particularly high barrier to entry, and that a redditor reading my post could *most likely* follow or have followed it and ended up in a similar situation.  

I definitely didn't need a loan of a million dollars.  

...but sure, I'll give you some advice - don't neglect yourself.

You are of course looking at this from the lense of a software engineer. This is too narrow minded.

What is needed is structural change, cultural change, and personal change. 

Let me put it in terms you will understand: a DevOps transformation can't be done by getting some dude write an ansible cook book and set up an Aws account.

What is needed is collaboration between development and operational teams, no fault post mortems, a build it own it culture, a fail fast mentality, automated testing.. So much more them just a DevOps engineer who sets up a cicd pipeline

I would suggest not to go against them more than 10% (a normal market swing) and definitely not to go against them with the intent to see it all fall away; this has the look of Apple after it's stock price rocketed when T.

My uncle bought a shit load of land in Grand Forks ND of all places like 50 years ago. He's sold off all that land for millions. It seemed like a wasteland, but because of the college/farming he knew someone would need it eventually.

Honestly I think buying into the republican vs democrat narrative is a lose/lose way of thinking. They agree on 99% of things. No slavery, legal alcohol, drive on the right aide of the road. The real fight is the souless corporations, ie hedgefunds, exxon, ge, and monarchies/dictatorships vs the common human being who lives life pursuing the betterment of their family and friends.

I offer one more tip: If you know you don't have the money *talk to the IRS.* They are human. Set up a plan. Work it out.

For the love of all things holy if you *know* you can't afford your taxes be pre-emptive and talk to them first; they will appreciate it and usually can and do cut you a deal. Taxes can be paid over time and generally based on the bracket you do out-earn the interest rate after deductions. You can even ask them to take a forced deduction from your paychecks if you prefer.

I've done this in the past.

Theater revenue will not recover. People who used to be solely movie goers will have built home systems that fix this problem so the videophiles and audiophiles have already beaten this. The question is then whether enough people went to movies *for the social aspect* and to be honest I don't think that is the case. 

I mean you definitely can double or triple your investment using basic Calls and some vega but I don't think it's a long play.

I was given $100 in bonds at my birth (1994). In three more years I will be able to cash them out, and after the issue price it will be worth $175.

$100 in 1994 has the equivalent value in 2021 of $176. So my bonds lost $1 value. I guess it's better than holding on to a $100 bill for the same period of time...

[deleted]
Remindme!
This is the way
You make a good point and truthfully I think its hard to say without a test reactor. I would say desalination and hydrogen production seem like good uses for SMR's where renewables have not really been peticularly relevant yet. There is also a whole host of new fuels that improve NuScales SMR's efficiency such as Lightbridge fuel. So on paper it looks as though NuScale is being conservative with their power projections. Of course we will have to wait and see if there are any construction cost over runs which would make a NuScale SMR less competitive on a cost basis. But even then it wouldn't suprise me if the DOE foots the bill since the government really wants to export this tech for some odd reason. But my investment thesis does not rely on NuScale's sucess. In my view all Fluor has to do to 2x their stock price is finish their loss contracts (currently projected to be done in 2021). That will dramatically reduce expenses and stablize the buissness. If I ignore NuScale then I belive the mining segment will probably be the main driver of growth long term as it is already something like 30% of revenue. It all depends on battery demand and the speed at which we transition away from oil and natural gas.

I have the opposite problem with my 13 year old son.   He's super annoying  and wants to just mokic memes and shit he's seen on the internet. He wants peoples acceptance, but he doesn't understand personal space or how people view him.  I encourage him to have original thoughts and I'm 100 positive he does, but everything he spews is random words, memes and occasionally facts... Which I like the last part. 
Stay in your room son, the adults are talking.
Tesla is going to $2,000 by 2030 (bear case) so I just buy and buy. Seems too risky to bet against the bull possibilities like autonomous robotaxi. Any major sell offs will be met with a parade of loyal buyers. Short at your own risk. Ask Gordon Johnson how that’s working out for him.

I'd be perfectly fine with enough on dividends to cover property taxes and utilities every month after covering my mortgage so at least 300k to clear the house loan then maybe a milli or 2 to cover the upkeep and leave me a couple hundo every week to play with.

That takes care of expenses and gives me and the wife the ability to focus on things we want to do instead of slaving away at work. Can always find a hobby that turns into a passion when you have all day to get into shit instead of having shit heaped on you.

You're trying to find love in a casino.
Georgia will vote on Tuesday for 2 senate seats in a runoff election . This consequently will determine if the Republicans will keep control of the senate or the Democrats will gain control over the both (house + senate). 
Best for them tendies imo will be for the Republicans to keep control. Biden amongst other things will surely hike taxes on corporations and go after big tech. With a repub majority this will fail to pass in the senate.

Edit: I know Biden is pro defense. Historically markets favor a divided executive and legislative branch. Dems flipping the senate is a big deal and will reflect on the market as a whole. All am
saying is wait a couple of days, godspeed tards
Oh I know it is.  I didn't mean to say it's chump change. But consider what I've done the last two weeks.  I bought ITM weekly calls like on a Tuesday and then a Thursday - I made 2.1k and then 2.5k the next time.  So it's definitely possible making little bits at a time.  I think both of those calls costed something like 1200 and 1600.

Why in the fuck did you idiots down vote this.
gonna cash out some share and pay off my car note 2 years ahead of schedule.

gonna be really frugal with my money until this pandemic is over.
I want to be the laziest richest man alive
Oh indeed
Hoping to be a ballsy retard.
The $1200 will be a credit, the 3k would be a deduction from taxable income, meaning *you don’t pay taxes on that amount*. I’m assuming the $600 will also be able to be credited. Say an effective tax rate of 30%.. $1200 + $600 + (30% * $3k) = $2700. So also assuming you’ve earned at least $3k, and you filed exactly the same as previous years, your refund will be ~ $2700 higher than usual.
It’s not that I’m certain it will, but this creates a buffer in the event that it does. I think it’s more about having confidence that it will atleast be higher than the ITM strike that I would buy on the calls. As long as I’m correct on that, I’ve created some degree of a hedge against missing upside without any real downside. Just thinking out loud I guess and looking for a flaw in the logic.

We have rich and poor theaters too, but it's not a village, it's the suburbs of a major city, just go a few miles in either direction to find both. My niece caught lice at the latter theater twice, but you are right, lots of people yelling at the screen, at least that's what she said. I think a lot of people find that very annoying. Do the village-poor people ever pretend they are city-poor and can't work more or do well in school? Nah, they sit around expecting other people to get them off while the rich people just fellate themselves (doing it for themselves because it needs to be done.) Enjoy the show.

Doesn't matter. The Chinese doesn't have a problem with alibaba either. They are just unhappy about how the big tech companies are not giving them enough due respect. 


So they just picked the most high profile person and the biggest company to set an example. It is just that they have a close association

Wife: "Can you please liquidate the $65k you have in RH so we can use it as down-payment for a house instead of renting when we move to Baltimore?"

Me: " LOL...no. I will turn it into $500k so we buy the house outright."

Wife: "Honey, please. What if you lose it all? Interest rates are historically low and this is a good time to get a mortgage. I heard it on my podcast."

Me: "Do you trust the podcast people more than me?"

Wife: "Yes, this is what they do. They're trained for this."

Me: "I won't sit here and be insulted. We are renting until I hit $500k and that's that."
🤡

P.S.
Anyone has any good tips on renting in Baltimore? Locations and areas to avoid? I'm leaning towards Federal Hill now. I've found one affordable place near Druid Park---is it a good place?
Another response pointed out how they use different clearing houses which leads to different execution prices

It's a fairly simplified description of reality for the smooth  🧠. Good job. But I disagree with the actionable points, shorting lagging/slow industries - most of them are heavily effected by COVID, there is not enough room to fall to correlate with a bubble burst. If your holdings are mostly tech and your hedge is non-tech then this hedge needs to be absolutely massive.

TAN fucks vigorously and without regard.
Not everyone believes a deal is coming this week. Actually only a few investors believe it. Everyone’s doubt holds the stock price down a lot. I can’t blame them for doubting this too much. It has been painful to wait and watch other stocks 10x. Fannie has been stuck under government control for 12 years now and investors are sick and tired of waiting so they let it go. So when the deal gets made this week the price will jump very high instantly, not giving much opportunity to buy on the way up in my opinion.
Hell yea
Guys were down 0.3%. We chillin unless 2k stimmy doesn’t work. 600 stimmy didn’t do absolute shit
I know this is boring, but historically, the average S&P 500 ROI is 7% adjusted for inflation.  So, at 65 that $60K ==> est $685K in today's dollars.

Premiums are so ridiculously high, good luck trying to time that shit. Probably going to have a day where it opens -10%, maybe -15%, and then just melts up all week after that or trades flat for a month. You're much better off daytrading the trend IMO.
Back when, it wasn't clear if inflation wouldn't increase beyond 14% since it had done just that over the prior few years.
I dunno. I think he has no realistic or practical path to remaining in the White House. But god knows what he’ll do as he gets more desperate. 

Meanwhile he’s so distracted trying to get someone to conjure 2 million votes for him that the vaccines aren’t getting distributed. 

He could pull some wild disruptive shit between the 6th and the 20th.
why?
my issue is the cost of this stuff.  It expensive and works well for big organizations.  They need a light version where a smaller business with LOADS of data and get this software and parse through it ASAP and get everything cleaned up.

You are spot on. But their digital transformation is in the beginning. They are dominos in 2008 right now.

But the main thing is: they need to recognise what is broken and visualise what a good solution would look like. Only then can you know what people they need!

The ones after millennials I believe
My guess is that by buying shares and propping price up against the shorts, he is trying to show he is pro-shareholder vs Sherman and trying to get proxy advisors like ISS and Glass Lewis on his side. If they back him, he will have a strong hand when he mounts a proxy vote to take control at the next shareholder meeting. I suspect he only needs to kick out 2-3 board members to gain control. Wolf and Evans will likely back him. Maybe Bill Simon as well. Sherman will be made to resign. This seems to be the Olsham playbook.

While I, as a pltr bull, love the enthusiasm, data insight is currently not the problem that gme faces.its actually delivering on what the modern customer wants: it's the ease of access, the speed of delivery, and the ability to critique.

Their digital transformation has just kick-started, and with Cohen I can see them make the step in the right direction. They will be tackling the ease of access fairly soon, then they need to build a forum like structure or something that allows customers to share their opinions on new developments and trends. Get participation - it's free publicity for them if it happens on their platform.

And then they need to sort out the delivery. If I order a ps5 I want it in the same fucking afternoon, not in two weeks time, having to pop to a shop and pick it up.

They should team up with doordash or something to make sure if I test it in the shop and say I want it, it's delivered to my house before I get home, or if I'm ordering from home, as fast as a drug guy can deliver his stuff.

If they can do those things, they will succeed.

Else they will fail to a competitor who does that

I think it taps into every camera feed and generates videos (real time) through facial recognition.  Then it can track cell phones, credit cards/tolls whatever and based on that trail can spit out a probability where they are hiding.  We are seeing a basic version on this.

The problem is that we’ve missed the big move (April rally) and at this time, everything is just way too overvalued.
So you fucked beaver's wife? Is that what you are saying
If you are confident NIO will be over 60 by 1/29 isn't buying calls a no brainier? Don't know if your question is a question

you gay bears never learn your lesson. if the futures are green , then MAYBE you will get a red day, but if futures are red then green by open

PLTR call $30 exp. 1/17... thoughts?
you think ppl in China even know jack ma is missing? not investors but random person on the street
At this point red futures are actually a good sign

not sure im seeing the point. I only have 2 contracts so 200 shares. sell for 9k now and buy 180 shares (using 50 a share for easy math) or keep holding and execute these for 200 shares for $700 a year from now. explain it to me like I am retarded.

Of course they found it it was their  infrastructure that was hacked, their entire codebase was hacked to put in backdoors. How the hell do you expect their competitors to notice this?

This is like saying volkswagen is an awesome car company because their cars explode but yeah they found it and fixed it so that shows superiority over the rest of the industry which don't have exploding cars.

Also fire eye makes security products while pltr makes data analytics products that can be leveraged for security purposes.

I didn’t actually hold because I am a pussy but I had $2200 on 6/29 earlier this year and the market closed on 7/2 instead of 7/3 because of 4th of July. On Monday(6/29) around 10:15 am I bought 17x 1100c 7/2 on TSLA for an avg cost of 1.25 per contract well if you weren’t following that week I’ll give you and idea of it 🚀🚀🚀 I sold early and mistimed my re-entry for the week and still had a decent week and went from 2k to 10k. Basically what could have happened though if I had just held the 17x calls in the first place is on Thursday(7/2) TSLA jumped up to about $1236 per share for a brief moment and the options at the time were selling for 170.00 something per thats 17x$17000=$289,000 from $2200 in one week. I am still salty over this but happy that I was able to still make 8k that week but to think what could have been :(
Take this shit back to r/investing.

Great post though. My tl;dr: Buy real estate.

You mentioned a real estate bubble, but there’s little evidence of one other than graphs of unprecedented prices. The only crash was due to the financial crisis but the backstops will prevent such a thing from happening again. If you have property in any urban area, housing *always* goes up. People will always live somewhere, but companies will not always make profit.
Hell yeah

Let's not forget the purpose of stock markets: To move money from lenders to borrowers. Passive index funds do that for the lowest cost possible.

And it is unclear by how much an underperforming company might be propped up since the most popular index funds prefer large market caps and/or extreme diversification between a lot of small caps.

GME doens hve the support of hardcore gamers. This will be key for Cohen.

GME is known for the shitty way it treats customers when buying back games for 30% 0f sales price. There's memes about  it. I uderstand they need to lowball to make a profit on "refurbished items".

Hardcore gamers also are peculiar on the packaging when buying used games. repackaging them in a shitty reprinted jewel case package doesnt cut it.

&#x200B;

Here's what they need to build:

They need to build a gamer-to-gamer trading platform.  Allow gmers to sell gamers and collectables online. This will enable them to further develop a commnunity and further the data collection on users by giving them a place to buy sell and discuss games. 

Offer free ship from/ ship to store.  All they need to do is put in a mailing station where the seller scans the QR code forthe shipment to print the shipping label and stuff it in an evelope. This will drive a shit load of foot traffic that will drive far more sales to make up for the lost revenue of used games.

Looking for real advice here. I sold 10 x $60 covered calls on NIO expiring 1/29. Pretty confident that I’ll lose these shares and some upside. Would it be a smart move to buy 10 x ITM calls at open expiring 1 week later? If my covered calls go ITM I’d lose the shares and then re-buy off the calls I bought. If the covered calls aren’t ITM, I keep the shares and sell the calls, hopefully for a profit. Or do I just let it ride and be content with 10k in profit regardless of what the upside ends up being?

Look at the amount of profit per $1 increase in a stock's share value (Delta). ITM costs more, but you invest less money than buying 100 shares of the stock outright. There are a lot more reasons. Less decay, etc. but you can always research the greeks.

Yeah, if we didn’t have kids and pets in haul, we would w/o question sell now and rent for a while. We’re instead considering a super low APR HELOC and put that money for remodeling and parking the rest anywhere we can reasonably get more than 2.5% yield. Still haven’t figured it out, but suffice it to say we’re in a seller’s market and chasing a house right now might end up just like chasing fomo stonks.

dips or no dips
When? It’s that close huh
No it isn't. That bond would pay 7% of its face value in coupons every six months. You would have to reinvest those coupons in the bond every six months at whatever future yield the bond is trading at when the coupon is paid. Since yields have fallen since then, you would have been reinvesting into the bond at a more and more expensive price. You can't lock in the rate you reinvest at unless you open some fancy schmancy derivatives contracts.

I work as a criminal intelligence analyst at an intelligence and anti-terrorism center. Our software looks similar to this, but ours is far more antiquated. It often crashes and we have to save our work frequently to avoid losing everything we have done. I would absolutely love if we had Palantir software, as it would allow us to do our job better and get more work done. I know it’s anecdotal, but I believe Palantir has a lot of room to grow. It isn’t even being used by organizations like mine yet and we are a fairly large center.

I've said it for a while now and glad I didn't short it this year. Who knows WHEN it will decline and to what extent and how much will it gain beforehand. That, and very pricey premiums, will deter me ever buying puts. Maybe weeklies the day it touches 1,000 and retraces back to 900.

GME is possibly the only exception and that's because it's barely 1bil market cap and literally everyone on here owns at least 100 shares.
Only reason they were that high was because the rate of inflation in the late 70s/early 80s was similarly high

100k you literally can’t do shit in any non shithole city. Things you can’t do:

-Have a family

-Travel like a decent human being and not a hobo

-Own good primary residence

-Save & invest enough to retire young 

-Probably a shitload of other things I’m too lazy to list

I suspect that Tesla will be the cause of the next big market selloff. I think Burry's prediction about Tesla's SP being vulnerable to a massive collapse is probably not far off, and if a massive selloff in Tesla happens a panic dump will be triggered in other speculative tech equities as well, indexes will follow. 

This said, I would never bet against Tesla given its track record of absolutely wrecking shorts, so I'm just staying away from it entirely.

You sound like the type that threw a molotov at a courthouse. This is no place for politics.
What is your flair a reference to?
Probably a good 30-40% of the commercial real estate funds I invest with are doing 1031 exchanges on their lower income area shopping centers that are pushing 25-40 years old, and are buying or building storage centers everywhere they can east of the Mississippi. Operating costs are so much lower and it’s literally guaranteed free money because Americans just refuse to part with their piles of shit.
I currently rent an apartment in a major US city and am looking to move to the suburbs. I understand that suburbs of major US cities are some of the most expensive real estate outside of the major cities themselves but even for suburban standards the prices are getting out of control.

They will likely outsource the development of software changes and maintenance as it would be cheaper than having to pay full salaries + benefits. 

Source: (my anecdote) I’m a software developer for systems integrations with 3rd party products, mainly oracle products, for retailers. Our whole business runs on us doing development for retail clients. They know how to sell clothes, shoes, and in this case games. It would be inefficient for a smaller company to pour resources to build this all in house.

Tesla was a green energy company in 2020...last 3 Q earnings profit boosted by selling carbon credits to GM and the like. 2021 shifting to ‘tech’ as revenue from credits drop and AI increases 🤷‍♂️

A combination of good job, low cost of living, good spending habits, and no college debt makes what you’re doing easily achievable. The problem in America is the whole college debt and cost of living situation (our housing market makes it hard to build equity).

The momentum has really flipped in the polls this holiday season, even Trafalgar is saying dem sweep.

Lots of opportunity here since split govt is what's priced in right now, so you can make plays that either won't move or will benefit. Also a lot of downside possible if you aren't prepared for a dip (being big in oil for example).

Keeping inflation low generally means raising interest rates.  At some point it’s likely to happen for that reason alone.

The other reason is that it’s helpful to be able to drop interest rates in a recession.

It’s not a guarantee I just wouldn’t bet against it.

None. Their yield is too small for someone as young and risky as me. I'd rather gain and lose $2k+ in a single day riding the highs and lows of FD trading than tie my money up for years on end.

...and so it begins
This place has literally always been like this.
When are they gonna start buying S&p futures? It's already an hour since the market opened.
In my area of Florida in the 1970's, my dad bought a house for $27,000. He was 19 and worked part-time in the summers driving a combine on a farm. He paid it off in 5 years, and was paying for college with the same job at the same time. That area blew up due to tourism in the 1990s. He sold that house last year for about $1.2M. Their house that they live in now is 12,000 sq. ft. and cost $74,000 to build in 1985. They have a 14 car garage...

When I moved, I was paying $1800 a month for a two bedroom condo. When my dad found out I paid about $500,000 for the house I live in now, he thought that was absolutely crazy. He estimated my house wouldn't cost more than $40,000. I was laughing at how out of touch he was. That's when he got the little house he bought in the 70's appraised. Funny enough, he was only charging the people that lived there $300 a month in rent. They got the deal of a lifetime. No wonder they never ever gave him any trouble at all.
Did they beat the estimates if there were any?

Right. Whan a job desc is written like this it means they literally have no one in the organization who know's how to build the future. They'd need to bring in an experienced tech leader to build and lead the team.  I still don't think existing mgmt would be able to do it though. It wouldnt get past negotiating the salary budgets for higher good designers and engineers.

My math wasn't a guess... 50$ call with a premium around $8.30 is a break even of $58.30 at expiration. God you guys are retarded. If it gets above 54.15 it'll be worth more than they are worth at his current price which will likely be very different at open.

He could also sell covered calls above 50.

You're right about interest rates killing home prices. The thing is though, why would you think interest rates are going to go back up? The whole modern economy is built on cheap money. The federal reserve of the last year has shown they will do ANYTHING to keep the economy growing and inflation low.

About Carl Icahn going big into psth?

Let's just assume they are paying good salaries and hiring the right people to pivot the company from a wrecked ship to an ecommerce giant. Would you agree that it requires more than building software which would take long to develop from absolute scratch? It's management, mid-management, and essentially changing the DNA of a company, something that was successfully done very few times in the past, especially when you are talking about something as radical. 

They are literally hiring 2 people in the ecommerce space and 2 more in technology. This stock may quadruple based on the expectations of other smooth brained retail 14 y/o traders.. or successfully pivot in the long run (unlikely)...  but for fuck's sake are you seriously looking at their current hiring  trying to deduct what's their strategic plans are? GME Cloud WTF man.
What was it, nice 💯
LOL.  GME with it's current mgmt would never pay this salary to a software engineer. It's gonna take a complete overhaul to bring in real tech talent and pay them appropriately.

Yup. As someone else mentioned, at the time they had an inflation rate of 10% meaning it was around a true yield of 4% gain in value annually. But when the rate slowed down it would have been well worth it continuing to pay out until around 2010. One of the reasons boomers are such fans of "time in market beats timing the market" while we YOLO on FDs because we have no choice but to time it since they ruined any other market for us after the markets got saturated

I hope that WSB will recognize the public storage boon and meme some of those stocks. Americans have so much shit in their homes that we have to rent out storage units. Which inevitably get forgotten about leading to reality TV shows about striking gold (or literal shit) in storage units. 

Either way, the parent company gets a 6-8% gross revenue fee from the franchisee, plus advertising fees too. Literally can’t go tits up.
After watching my landlord here in Chicago have a ‘gypsi’ family move in and not pay rent for 8 mos (pandemic eviction moratorium) while stealing me and my roommates shit.

Ever wonder why poor people buy lottery scratchers?  

It's because when you're poor, there is no chance of becoming un-poor by saving your money and spending responsibly.  Something is going to come along and wreck whatever progress you make before long.

So, put $1 in your savings account = 0 % chance of escaping poverty.

Put $1 in a scratcher = .00001% chance of escaping poverty

Agreed, autists can't wait till march, what was I thinking? I believe theater stocks may possibly be higher than their original all time highs sometime in 2022, which is why I'm holding shares long term. However, we are more knowledgable about the virus now and positive vaccine news are almost always a play. We are getting a record number of vaccines out every single day. Even if it won't eradicate the burden until 2022, vaccinations will curb the severity of the pandemic sooner than you think. Public opinion and article headings are all that matter in our business of tendies.

Please tell me how. I want to do better.
Wow. i was thinking about this the other day. i sit here and wonder how im still financially better off than when i was working all the time like a slave. "investing" actually promotes saving which literally almost no regular american does anymore. Its all spend spend spend. pay bills . take out loans. dont ask questions. but if u really try hard and know the system u can basically live for free in this country already. I have no cellphone bill . i cut my own hair. i get foodstamps and live off the college money that they keep sending me even tho ill never get a degree because theres basically no limit and itll just get wiped out someday anyways as part of a "stimulus". Learning to invest helps u understand the value of money better . should i smoke today? well if i smoke that like 70 $ a week. I could buy a bunch of cheap options for 5 dollars and turn that into 700... probably wont. but i COULD . its happened. u start to understand that money makes money and so u stop wasting . U should be using a free texting and calling APP too . works on wifi . free phone number. own ur car if u have one. Liability only bare minimum.. net monthly expenditures are 375 for rent everything included (wifi too). which is paid til april. im literally completely free.
First day of trading 2021 starts tomorrow. I have full faith that this year, the market will better then last year. I see TSLA going to the moon this year🚀🚀🚀🚀

Per my last comment: **An Extension**

Okay, if everyone could follow my ideology of freeway driving would be more efficient.

Right lane: entering and exit lanes should be the only lanes driving 0-5mph under limit, you need to cut your gap in and blend the speed of track. Same with exiting, you want to speed into your exit when merging off so the entering fucks can get on behind you. *think zipper*

The middle lanes are for the actual posted speed limits also trucking lanes... literally you are just traveling hence the fucking name of these lanes retard.

The left lane, clearly this is the I wanna go 15mph above the posted speed limit because I got places to be. If you are driving 15mph over you should be **passing** the retards to the right of you. Good news, if you pretend like are in right lane..... the same principle apply for entering and exiting this lane 🤯

Well, if I look at a literally pile of shit on top of noodles, then Top Ramen is a Michelin star meal. 

Point is, Ireland, like the other EU periphery states, suffer from high debt-to-GDP ratios, low incomes, and a Euro that best serves diversified, service driven high-incone countries like France, Germany, The Netherlands and Austria, while making it difficult for poorer Eurozone countries to compete with equally middle-income countries with independent currency.
At least you’re not in the negative !!

Maybe the reason why Jack Ma’s head is so obscure is because it’s actually a intergalactic space-faring alien wearing a synthetic human suit that’s secretly trying to cripple the CCP.

Reason he’s missing is because they got *it* locked down in a lab.
this should be the first sentence on palantir's wikipedia tbh, great summary.
They are also incentivized to do everything to stay in the index, which might be very bad for the business itself. I'm arguing that once they are in the index, they get advantage over competitors, which benefits the management and existing shareholders while making a stock worse value for new investors. I'm not saying that individual stocks can beat the index, that's too abstract. 

I suggest looking into Japan. The picture is quite dire there: different branches of government (mostly central bank) own huge slices of index funds which resulted in extreme overvaluation and, relatively, cemented indexes. Thus making people who owned indexed stocks almost a new class, which can not be reached by new market participants.

I would imagine that if you didn't have a bot scraping everything coming in on new (or taking screenshots of posts) and seeing what got removed that it would be tough to tell. I'm more skeptical all the time of what goes on in here.

My counter-argument would be that just about everyone has had ample time to put a position on for GME. Either you're just FOMO'ing more money in or it's payday and you're adding to your existing position.

I would assume so. But it’s less so whether or not you are in school but the fact that you file taxes on your own and were claimed by your parents last tax season. Most of the people in this category happen to be students.

If you were claimed last season you didn’t receive the stimulus check. You can file independently this year and claim up to the $1200 that was given out.

There's more daily losers than winners lately so that may be a sign to switch sides even though the 500 gives us the illusion of a roaring market by simply picking a couple of winners everyday to offset the losers.

Yeah don’t fall for the outbid game. Patience will save you bundles. We were in the same boat with our first home, every offer got outbid or rejected for months. The realtor finally recommended us waiting for the market to cool off. 7 months later the real estate collapsed happened and we were able to get a much nicer house for $40k less than asking price. Right now there’s a super bubble because borrowing has never been cheaper, so every one is trying to up size their mortgage and lock 30 year fixed at 3-and-change apr. But new construction keeps going at record pace. Soon will catch up with demand and we’re going to see prices stabilize.

It’s wild, the housing markets in some areas see so many people moving to them, that new housing development can’t keep up even with all the money in them. This on top of the fact investors and ultra wealthy are taking advantage of the lopsided housing market where people are paying hundreds of thousands for 1000-1500 sq ft homes that were built 40-50 years ago and have little in the way of modernization or remodeling done to them. Literally as much as new homes in the area that are so much nicer... but those get bought up within a day or two of being listed and are selling just to fill up the neighborhoods!

And the next time around, everyone will still go, "Ah, maybe \*this\* time it'll be different with China." Like a bunch of abused wives, or people who haven't read The Frog and the Scorpion.

>th the House AND Senate to pass along to the President for a signature. In regards to MJ bills, since the House has been blue (Democratic majority) and Pelosi as majority leader supports reform and therefor allows bills to hit the floor and get a vote. This is where MJ bills shine, in the House of Representatives. However that’s as far as they get because the Senate is Red (Republican Majority) and Mitch McConnell doesn’t support reform. Therefor bills get blocked and aren’t

But Mitch McConnell is scheduled to get COVID in early January and die though.. We should be good. TLRY to the MOON baby\~

Not saying it’s not possible to get a good return, it’s just a lot of fucking work.

This guy is correct. Sherman knows how to run brick and mortar but he doesn’t know or care about hiring SV talent. Honestly now is a great time to hire because people want remote and also want to move out of the Bay Area to other places like Texas (well, not grapevine). 

Outsourcing won’t work either. They’d need to actually start a new development office IMO and that shit takes time. Optimistic scenario for a complete overhaul (from scratch) is like 2 years. Given the time frame and how GameStop is like currently, it makes total sense why Melvin is shorting them. The money on hand, loan repayment etc don’t actually matter on a 4-5 year window unless they really go all in on tech.

You don't know what moves the institutions are making. They might claim to be on the bears side only to fuck the bears over first chance they get. These institutions will be getting into the stock and we don't know when. Part of the point I am kinda making is that we are getting into the institutions real target price range so bears should watch their butt holes.

You've hit the nail. I've been thinking about this exact thing for 3 days now, trying to make a thesis for myself about this. I'm not fully there to give you an answer but currently I would say that there's clearly some irony in Ark's criticism of etfs. But you can see it as an attack on other etfs (broad ones), not an idea of an etf. Which starts to resemble a marketing stunt if you consider that they collect managing fees.

Lol. The issue is different depending where you are. 

In MI, I don’t think this is a consumer level problem. This is a supplier level issue, like telling people to use less gas (1970s) versus mandating pollution and mileage standards for manufacturers of cars. Most of the issue with water here is unequal bargaining power between average people and big entities. Perfect situation for gov to step in and regulate. 

Here, they don’t because Nestle is too big and influential in politics. This isn’t an issue with people watering their lawns too much because we have the water, but more of an issue with corporations using more than their fair share with no benefit to the state. 

On CO river on the other hand, the issue is just too many people in a desert wanting to live not in a desert lol. More of a consumer level problem. Stop watering your damn lawns people! Who tf wants a lawn in the middle of the desert anyways? Cactuses are way cooler.

Gov does have regs on showerhead flow and toilet flow etc unless mango gets rid of them like he’s been talking about (hurts his hairstyle lol)

That's not how it works, the annual coupon of 13.375% is at the par value of the bond (£100). The current market value of this bond is £207.50. Meaning the annual coupon (interest) is actually 6.45%.

Note: par value refers to face value of the bond, or at maturity the principle that will be repaid.

Check out Cineplex CGX in Canada. They have a bank partnership with Canadian Scotiabank to push points cards and credit card partnerships. Very good at diversifying their business while also having a monopoly on theater business. There was a DD I mostly agreed with a little while ago here.

I think they have a February earnings call which will see if they are going to be able to keep afloat. 

I think there are better places for your money than the movie theater play its a while away yet. There will be a better time to get in.

Sorry English is not my first language, so all of my material probably would not help you as it's not in English. But as a very general direction, there are government bonds and corporate bonds. Most have a rating from the different rating companies, and bonds with a decent rating (contrary to so called "junkbonds") have a yield of 0.xx% or even go negative for the most part. It's not the best time to get your money in bonds in my opinion.

nothing, it's not real. the thing he listed is from 30 years ago, todays yield on that same bond is negative. you lose money by investing in that bond today.

the person was like "no you can get 13% today" then as proof he listen a 30 year old bond that used to give 13% but now gives a negative rate.

The wife and I are looking for a home and we both make pretty decent money, about $150,000 combined yet anytime we find a home we are outbid. We've gone as far as to offer 30 or 40 over the asking price and still get outbid every time. Sometimes I'll just search for homes that are outrageously expensive in my area, like $700,000 on up and then I'll do the same search two weeks later and notice that many of the homes that were in that search a week ago are no longer listed and I'm assuming that means that they sold. Who are these people that can afford to pay the better part of a million dollars for a home and how are there so many of them?

If Ma is actually dealt with, what reason does the CCP have to go after BABA? They would've sent the most terrifying sign to all the other billionaires to know their place. Their companies don't matter if they aren't to be found anywhere, dead or alive.

It's really not a "cheaper car" 40% of users use BaaS and it lowers the cost by 20k USD. NIO is rapidly expanding the network of station right now. 100 more coming and probably many more to come. I think they will be able to develop many as these swap and charging stations are heavily subsidized by the government.
For awhile there, government bonds actually had negative interest.
I’m buying the dip (again) on Monday. I have come to the conclusion PLTR is undoubtedly going to become a global powerhouse, but it ain’t gonna happen one night. This is a buy low, wait stock. Will be a fun and interesting ride to the top though.

Shorting stuff is tempting except for the redonkulous amount of free money sloshing around now.

I was thinking last night about hoe selling puts on very high vol stonks is basically helping myself to all that money sloshing around. They chase the price, the iv goes nuts, it corrects a bit and I'm there selling 3 month puts atm for 25-40% of the price of underlying. Thinking about using thr proceeds now to buy the stonk so I dont miss as much on the retard strength moves as i did with palantir and chargepoint.
Movie theaters were already in big trouble (more than the usual decline) once Endgame left theaters. Disney went on an insane 5 year run where they had MCU, Star Wars, and live action remakes all at the same time. In 2019 Disney ran out of all 3 at the same time.

I worked for one of the big 3 chains and they were already looking into serious cost cutting measures because the industry was projected to drop a few billion in 2020.

I will say that if any theater chain comes out of this strong it’s going to be CNK. But things are looking pretty grim for everyone.

>they just need a semi competent dev to come in and force their current favorite frameworks on the company.

This tends to not work. What they need is a strong team of dev leads that can identify the correct software guardrails to invest in + project management/prioritization skills. This is the only way to take subpar dev talent and ship a successful product. It's less about the actual "tech" being used.

The product side of GME is less interesting. You're right, it's just ecommerce.

That depends if big money is willing to trade the extra liquidity for passage of any law that reduces retail volume. Idk enough about retail volume to know if its even significant though.

5-10% OTM typically 5-24 months out, compare every month and you’ll usually find a discrepancy where a strike is much cheaper between months. The goal is to find low delta plays because they have less volume. Finding discounted contracts is really the end game. Once volume picks up, delta will increase. compare the past month of growth, consider that a baseline and find a strike within an area you can tolerate risk for. For me it is 5-10%

And of course consider IV always

Left-Tail / Right Tail is in reference to extreme deflation (Aging Demographics, crippling Debt payments, and ultimately debt restructuring/default) or extreme inflation (Central Banks finally get the inflation they want, but don’t have the political will to fight it once inflation is high enough to destroy productivity). There are few other ways to escape such a high debt load unless AI, Automation, Metaverse tech, and Genomics can dramatically raise productivity like the internet did. The two extremes being opposite tail events that can both destroy an economy.

I disagree here though. The main benefit of using modern tech stacks/practices is increased velocity and the cost of rewriting becomes significantly less. I would be more sympathetic to your argument if their current product was already good.

6 $29 2/19, 11 $27 3/19, 16 $30 8/20, 60 $30 1/21/22. Hopefully, who ever is holding Bidens leash is also a fan of dystopian futures where I'm rich.

McDonald's is a tech company masquerading as real estate company masquerading as a fast food company. They save a shit ton on staffing with their electronic ordering kiosks/uber eats partnership. Their product consistency is way higher than all rivals. Their marketing is insidious, if you checked your mail in the last week you probably got McDonald's coupons because every year people make a resolution to not eat McDonald's, so every year they send out coupons to break you. They counter rival promos with their own promos to build habits, $1 coffee etc..

when are futures open?
It’ll hit 50 before 15th but the much more important point is: what was the IV when you bought it? If it was sky high then you need NIO to post a big move up very quickly to be back in profit. Next important point: how much did you buy, one call? If so then just hold and learn one way or another.

Around here, the movie experience kind of sucks. Not the movie, just the people going to see it. I stopped going after college.
I bought for longterm. I belive NIO will have greater value then 10 dollars yes. But that's when they are selling alot of cars every year. I also still do not belive in their BaaS model. They have to have it manned with people and they only had like 145 stations for know. Imagine them selling 200k cars per year and manned stations everywhere for their battery stations. I dont see how that will work good unless they have several thousands of stations for swapping.   


I belive in their market though. But now when Tesla will sell a cheaper car that litterally no one really can compete with it's very hard to see how they can grow good. Nothing has changed since a few months ago. price is rid. at these levels now.

They’re definitely able to make just as much money as weeklies/quarterlies, usually just takes more patience, but with more patience comes less stress!

I still play the short term options, but having those in your back pocket and watching them make steady gains feels a lot better than having to check something constantly and being let down when shit hits the fan.


You bet.

Idk there’s more but that shit pisses me off. Fuck you.
Gonna call TD tommorow, ask them to find me an extra 11,780 dollars from my FDs that expired worthless. I know TD was taking away parts of stock machines which allowed my calls to go negative.


Tell them The people of WSB are angry and there's nothing wrong with saying, you know, um, that you've recalculated.
What about IV?
Why BABA? They are literally pending bad news from the antitrust investigation. Obviously the CCP ain't gonna nuke BABA, but something not positive is going to happen. Much more potential in BABA competitors in the short term like Pinduoduo and JD. Long term potential in BABA, sure, but they are going to have a negative press day any day now.
US gov has made it pretty clear you can go fuck yourself if you want anything from them.

>Hiring shit devs working with shit tech leads to unmaintainable poorly developed apps.

This is like 90% of all software that has been created, including successful ones.  You don't need a good code base to have decent product most of the time.  And most devs I've interacted with think they are hot shit but shit is exactly what they put out.  Fact is unless you're working on something revolutionary it's not going to need excellent code.  You can always trash it and rewrite it every 5 years without much issue

#BABA TRADING AT 169 IN CHIPPENDALES AFTER CONSECUTIVE LIMIT DOWN SESSIONS
100% agreeing with you, recent example was trading during this winter holiday, where there was no job-related stress but the energy spent during open hours caused me to feel sort of drained at the end of the day.  Would be something I’ll weigh carefully when everything aligns nicely. Have a crazy profitable 2021 brother, appreciate the input 🙏🏻🥂

My parents are the epitome of this. They graduated in the mid-eighties from college with like $800 in debt. They were able to pay for most of their college by working part-time at McDonald's for $4 an hour. They bought a brand new house less than a year after having me for $120,000. That house is worth almost $500,000 now.

If rates go up, nominal prices fall because people are mostly financing home purchases. Purchasing decisions are made based on the monthly rate.

>50% when i think someones dd is too simple and they just cant make money like that it actually ends up working.

As pointed out, "large fees for repair" and "making it difficult/impossible for 3rd party repairs" are both common to automakers in the "luxury" segment.  I remember when getting a nail in my X3 tire cost $500 to fix.

As far as compromising safety, I don't see that.  I see a few incidents that have percolated up through the media hype machine, but no widespread issues that are compromising safety.  In the absence of evidence to the contrary, I tend to believe that Tesla's world-leading crash safety ratings make them the safest consumer vehicles in the world.

We’ll probably see heavy lobbying against retail investors this year, and they’ll probably blame us if the market crashes.
It’s a solid analysis but the thing that’s been irking me is why Ryan has not gone full hostile and keeps driving the price up. It’s not to his advantage. My conclusion is that he wants it to remain public and this is a way to solicit the proxy without buying a control position. I own 157,000 shares. This is not investment advice but my own opinion only. Consult with a finance professional if you want advance.

This post was never intended as a ticker tip. I have those posts too (note that I'm no good in timing the market, even though most of my tips did print). I had some ideas I wanted to express and maybe help someone with hedging and providing tools to look for those sweet tenbaggers.
People in 2015 were talking about waiting to buy in the city I live in until after the "bubble" burst. I bought a house in 2015 and sold it for 44% more than I paid in 2020. Oops. I guess that old bubble will burst some other year

Personally, I want those poor lazy stupid fucks to stop stealing money from all the blue states. But thats not what a just society would do. A just society would give all them their $2000 (that I paid for), public healthcare (cheaper btw), and other assistance so they can have some disposable income to cycle back into the economy. And I want to actually pay for it with the taxes that rich people have been evading for decades.

Republicans just want to take all the welfare and give it to rich people in tax breaks. The whole time they spend like crack addicts, too. All the while they're begging the federal government to funnel money into their third-world states.

Whats the difference between Kentucky and a third world country? Fuckin nothing, and republican politicians can thank dumb suckers like you for that.

PSTH
She needs a RH account.
Its really really tricky. On one hand rates/supply are at historic all time lows so it would be a solid analysis to assume when they go up prices will go down. But to get to that point we'll probably see years more worth of appreciation. So a home today at 100k will probably got to 130k before then "dropping" to 125k four or five years from now. In that time you missed out on a 30% overall appreciation and 5 years of building equity to get a 5% "reduction" on a price point 30% higher than where it is today.
Don’t do it lol

So, basically, Reflexivity is real.
I agree their e-commerce solution is key.

I think they are going to outsource their solution. Why develop new when they can partner with someone? Let's pick a random e-commerce success story, like maybe Chewy?

Why in-house when you can out-house?

I agree with OP and came to this same conclusion. They are hiring like a boomer retail company and will never get any real talent until they have a complete mgmt makeover. Cohen needs to fire half the MBA's and bring in UX designers and SW engineers from real tech companies.  I'm all in on GME leaps though as I believe in RC think he will turn it into the AMZ of gaming once he's in charge.

Intel can’t fight it’s way out a wet paper bag to 9nm while TSM is building 7nm for anyone who can afford it and an exclusive deal with AAPL on the 5nm.

AMD doesn’t make their own chips, they’re paying TSM to make their 7nm line.
They have hundreds of thousands in equity in their homes, no?

Also, I wonder what kind of people respond to a poll from SlickDeals.... My guess is their population skews younger.

Volume and implied volatility tend to drop off after a few hours. Lunch time lull. The underlying’s price and IV are core factors in the option’s value, so ideally you’ll buy the calls when these two are at their lowest.

There are a lot of factors on the upside, and the downside narrative is crumbling, those who spotted this early are absolutely doing well off this play, those late to the party can still jump on board, the door price has gone up in the last 6 months, but the afterparty is going to be worth it.

Netflix’s game is volume yet shit content. Peacock has Universal however not adding the entire library specially not the new movies.  If anything my money is on Disney & AT&T.

May I remind you what happened to tesla?
Sounds great, but I will give a little caution that trading as a sole job is harder than doing it knowing you still have your day job. It ends up being a hell of a lot of pressure and that pressure can cause some dumb and emotional trades. Nothing is worse than a whole day “working” and you LOSE money. Not trying to be a Debbie Downer - I built my portfolio up to where I could try it full time and quit my day job. It didn’t work out too well. 

I ended up getting a job and my trading was far less emotional and the gains came back. Perhaps it is just me though, just keep this all in mind.

Yea it's more memes and repeated and desperate pump on meme stocks than actual stock tips. Especially how it progresed this year. It used to be good, but now it's a shit hole.

This is all bullshit.

1. Predictions work. This entire sub is dedicated to predicting. That's what "due diligence" is. The art of prediction is usually poorly understood; retail (and average people) handle prediction in two distinct ways:

Method 1: "Obviously." This is when something that *was not a given* occurs. For instance the fall of retail; someone obviously predicted and bet correct that retail would lose steam about 30 years ago and 30 years ago the general populace rolled their eyes. On the same turn even the posterchild of this sub at the moment, GME, was predicted some years ago to be worth far less and it turns out that the prediction *did hold* but we are geared up mentally to dismiss correct predictions and discard them as "obvious outcomes" that "anyone could have come up with".

Method 2: "I told you so!" The second mental hang-up occurs here where history proves people wrong. This is where the myth that prediction is a stupid thing comes from; the predictions that are overwhelmingly correct get ignored by and large and the ones that are wrong get pointed out! Again, GME, the prediction that it would head way down was not inaccurate; GME lost well over 90% of it's value at one point, but in this moment, from that approximate low, it is up 500%. Since we discard the "old thesis" no matter how correct for the current bet we of course are saying that the shorts are stupid (even though a short over the past 3 years would have paid handsomely and honestly if it is a 3 year old short they're still well within the green) and that we are right.

These two facts are pernicious. They lead people to make an error in judgment where current circumstances eclipse accurate outlooks and vice versa, dismissal of data that disagrees with personal outlook becomes the norm. In essence anyone who says predictions are shit doesn't know what a prediction is or the anatomy of such.

&#x200B;

1. "Don't lose money" said in way too many words.
2. The 80/20 rule does not apply well to market profits; it is closer to 99/1. In fact if it did this makes no sense because this writer states to "do nothing and be ready" but also states "you don't know when" and it turns out that no one knows when even when it happening. This only makes sense if you're indexing honestly.
3. This shit is stupid. Charts are what cause people to take tremendous risks and lose everything in a day. Discipline equates having a plan before the trade. When do you exit the trade? You decided that before you entered it. Those who don't are sitting staring at worthless day-to-day data which is usually equivalent to throwing away your money in a pit.
4. There are way too many academic papers that disagree.
5. This is a horrible idea unless you have a lot (II-type money) of cash. Most of the profits of any trade are in the initial stages of the trade; that means that your multiple is best at the start rather than towards the end. You are better off defining your risk size before, taking the trade, and letting it run than trying to "time and size" the trade. That's guaranteed to cause FOMO and erratic behavior esp if you're drooling over charts for "discipline".
6. The only true thing.

TLDR: It's all bullshit written for clicks.

Are you aware of such a thing as share recalls? Call it fairy tales all you want, but shorts are really trapped here.

Someone like Melvin might find an out, but the rest will still amount to a substantial number of shorts.
If they’re on the other side of bankruptcy, besides the cost of grid upgrades I don’t see why they wouldn’t be on the way back to at least 40

I wouldn't mind if people spent the money on GME shares instead of platinum or golden fuckboys. But if I got an award, I'll buy the equivalent amount of GME in your honor
And no one knows it’s platinum....other than enthusiasts/retards

awards are why the admins won't purge or quarantine wsb. it keeps the sub safe.

Neither are an investment. Your natural diamond will be worth pennies on the dollar at resale.  If you have the cash and can afford natural go that route. It means something to give her a diamond and the real value is that she can pass it down to the next generation. But if you are looking at it as an investment you are driving down the wrong highway. Do you expect to get it back, and to sell it?
Awards are pointless. Okay I said it, so I get one now. Right?

If you want cheap options which also play on uncertainty look at the UVXY.  Volatility is close to it’s all year low while all the markets are at all time highs and most likely will see some volatility.  Big upside but it’s also a finicky asset class so you have to monitor it closely as it may spike up 20% and then retract the same day. Also need to go deep in the money and give yourself at least 3-6 weeks out.
Oooh I played this RimWorld scenario!

So much high expectation for PLTR from passing of the defense bill, new year, seekmyretardness article, demo day, upcoming earnings, all this is making me hella nervous. The chart is NOT pretty. I've got a massive long position because I have high expectations for this company, but I expect a shitty first couple of weeks of the year at least. I think high teens is a definite possibility.

I’m glad you paid attention to that too, because my analysis on that exact merger gave me insight to the Tilray Aphria merger. I think we could easily see a similar scenario but right now sentiment is simply bearish on the industry, and I think a lot of hit has to do with the regulatory framework surround cannabis laws. Tuesday would provide a major glimmer of hope.

I’ve got A TON of NIO shares (~5,000) and I couldn’t agree more. Love the company, but it’s will be interesting to see how they compete with Tesla moving forward. In 2021 NIO will have justify their valuation and it’ll be interesting to see how their delivery numbers stack up this year (YOY) now that Tesla has the giga factory fully up and running. I hope the new sedan they are going to release has a good price point.

So I’m a democrat.  With that said I also hope they win for several reasons however none of those include the market doing well next week.  Actually if the Dems win both seats I can almost guarantee the market is going to take a huge dump.  An all blue government means bad news for;
-Big Tech
-Big Pharma 
-Health Providers 
-Big Banks
- Fintech 
- US Dollar etc etc... 

The market pumped hard on Nov 3rd after the presidential elections as it calculated for a split Gov’t Democratic President & Republican Senate (maintain status quo).  And that shit is priced in or at least a big chunk of it.   So if you want the market to pump next week keep your fingers crossed for the republicans to keep at least one of those two seats.

PLTR is fairly valued. That is all.
In a year from now, you ll regret not buying BABA
Just for reference: the all stock merger with shares of APHA converting to TLRY at a defined ratio creates an arbitrage opportunity. This happened with VSLR and RUN over the summer and can be partially attributed to an almost 300% increase leading up to the completion of the merger. I am hoping something similar plays out here. It began immediately for VSLR and RUN but has been slow going here, so far.

Don't have time for a full DD but EV adoption means nickel (it's happening whether it's TSLA, old gasoline car companies switching, or, if hell freezes over, NKLA) and VALE is solid, so worst case scenario you still beat the boomers if your timeline is long enough for a LEAP. I just have like 10% in there so I don't feel like PLTR drops so hard. But disclaimer, I bought at $11 which seemed like an extreme safe bet, dunno if I would've bought at $16 or not
No way

Well, I can always roll them out and up. Also could pick up OTM calls expiring a week after my covered calls expire. If I lose my shares on 1/29, I exercise my calls. Or is that retarded?

Not really true.  Unless you're buying real garbage. 

Real estate prices in desirable parts of the country will always outpace inflation in the medium-long run.  If rates do go up, you've locked yourself into historically dirt cheap rates.  Real estate prices aren't falling.  Just make sure to buy stuff in places people actually want to live in, not some shit exburb of Las Vegas or something.  

This entire country's policy is built to favor home ownership.

How many TEN BAGGERS were there in 2018?! This is simply a framework for identyifing   
ten baggers setups over potentially multi-year periods. Also, the one stock mentioned in this post that did trade in 2018 was a ten bagger.

How to test your thesis: 

1. arbitrarily choose single year period (probably your best performing)
2. Look what "skyrocketed": SPY - 6%, DOW -5.6%, Qs -3.5%
3. Dismiss post I didn't read

Quick answer: done and done
Those various articles that you're reading were paid for and funded by someone. Ask yourself: Why would someone spend so much time, money, effort to FUD $PLTR? Eye of Sauron in software form is a valuable thing.

Good luck my dude! I think there will be a small pop just because I’m an idiot but I can’t see it running up passed $26-$27. I so many idiots are about to expire worthless cause they bout crazy calls months ago... dude I road that wave and literally sold the top cause the run up was absolutely absurd I can’t believe people thought it would keep running, mind blowing.

I bought SQ at around 15-20 and had some NIO under $3 and I sold them both when they went up 50% because I am a financial genius.

I'm sorry but the Europe expansion is fraught with failure. I know of no Chinese vehicle companies making it big in Europe. They may do well in poorer countries in eastern Europe, but even then I doubt their infrastructure can handle an influx of EV's.

If someone can splash 30 - 50k on a new tesla or electric Jaguar/land rover or BMW then they will never pick a Chinese car. Even if its say 5k cheaper, I highly doubt people with that much money will care. Not to mention all the other red tape such as crash tests that they need for Europe.

I’ve actually turned bearish in the short term. There’s too many retail holders that don’t “believe” in the company but just want to make a quick buck. They’re the same idiots that paper hand dump when some analyst sets a price target 40% below the Share price currently.

Until we get more institutional buyers this thing isn’t going anywhere other than the odd pump and dump based on a new minnow contract. And guess what? Tutes aren’t buying in until this is hammered down to close to the dpo price.

I blame retail, their chicken shit paper hands and stupid OTM options purchases for the slow, eve it sideways slide. It’s going to get worse before it gets better.

All of the BaaS revenue is pretty much factored in to the price already with this valuation. The only thing that makes them stick out. The price of BaaS is 10 dollars a month. Even if they in the distant future sell a millions cars in a year and every single one chooses BaaS they will only make 120 million a year from those new sales.

AMD will hit $200 end of 2021
Honestly, a Republican senate will be gridlocked by Ol’ Mitch trying to block anything Biden wants. Likely bad for everyone. Ideally leading to a full blown economic meltdown that they can roundly blame on Biden / Dems.

Green energy will get a boost most likely, there’s job and growth in it, so soft energy bills will get passed.

Weed, on Dems non existent majority if they capture both seats won’t happen. Best case is more state legalize in the 4 year period to take a challenge to the feds/ Supreme Court. Likely knocked down by republican majority on court.

Likely risks will be sanctions on China being lifted/relaxed, maybe decrease in saber rattling at Iran and less enthusiasm for weapons manufacturing.

Maybe also banking regulations to be tightened up, less stock buybacks for boomer stocks.

No real idea though, Biden is as corporate / lobbied as they come. Could just be republican lite for 4 years.

I don’t get bulls who say shit like “retard bears who have been short since March” except to convince themselves of their own genius? It’s a total straw man. I mean it was fairly easy to be bearish in February and March and then be bullish in March and April. There were a lot of bullish indicators including three 9-1 up days in like two weeks as well as a massive uptrend where if anybody was extremely bearish at that point you’d be retarded. Also as I recall there were a lot of people who are all bulled up now who were totally convinced we’d “retest the lows” in April. It’s also fairly easy to be bearish again now.

I like it but the IV in all GME options (calls & puts) is too high.  At this point none of the options will reward you on the price direction it’s all based on the IV.   If the volatility in the options goes down (regardless puts or calls) you are gonna bleed out.  The only way to make money on that trade is for the IV to maintain or increase plus the stock also needs to fall a good amount.  Too much can go wrong and think you can find opportunities with better odds.
\*shrug* I thought PLTR was the AirBnB IPO when I bought it. You can only do so much.

Sure I thought the name was weird, but Schwab's PLTR news column clearly said AirBnB in the headline of one of the articles.

Yeah shit is like 110+ PE with overhead of mass manufacturing cars and building out factories. And they haven't lowered the price of their cars to where demand can be a thing beyond millions... like of the richest country on earth who the fuck can YOLO on minimum 35-40k new cars during a recession -- and at what point they think it'll matter to produce M3s in China when the 1% of people who can own them in their life own one? but if economy is alright then they'll do alright.

Rule #4.0 - free stimulus must be used in a manner such as to improve the financial health of a public company. Often referred to as the “tards go hards” rule, one innovator will often already have a bottom tier brokerage account that they use to send mass invites to friends and family. They then throw a dart, and the selected ticker must receive all funds via stock or options within the close of the following business day (barring market holiday, see Rule #4.69)

Was it really red for all stocks last week?  Strange as all 4; Dow, S&P, Nasdaq & Russell 2K set new historical levels last week.  Actually during the last day of trading both the DOW & S&P closed with fresh new annual and historical highs.  So yes we can totally be red and most likely will specially if there is volatility due to the GA runoff election.
Short?
Paycheck? What's that?
Funny, I massage prostates so I can buy PSTH.
Guys be careful this year shiller p/e is at near record all time highs when this happens we get massive corrections we deep down know this is not sustainable I don’t want see people here suffer financial death. It’s been a good year please hedge at least a little this year round.

Timing selloffs is too hard for puts to be consistently profitable (except for March). Thus they are only good for hedging. Hedging is for pussies. Therefore you should never buy puts and bears r fuk.

Diamonds don’t hold value no matter what unless you’re buying literally like 1/1 diamonds. But most likely you will lose money on your ring no matter what. Just go with the lab grown and consider it a loss. 

Also, if you’re ever in a desperate enough position and you’re going to a jeweller to sell your diamond ring... the jeweller literally knows this and will fk you on the deal anyway.

Not quite, friend, but not entirely wrong. I was born with a minor genetic variation in the way my brain handles secondary processing of incoming stimuli, and a few less relevant changes. Growing up, i was responding differently than my peers to similar observations, affecting the course of early dendritic arborization to a degree thatbI was never all that similar to other kids, and now most adults. When I give a ridiculously lengthy gain, it's an expression of effort to share my thoughts clearly. Fear of ostracization, just as you guessed :) Being unable to generate sitting scripts for these situations, i oft find myself stuck in ramblings increasingly shaped by the input from my brain to the speech centers, where wordless thought without pictographic evidence gets showed into a meat grinder and shaped like hamburger into viable language. So, to combat this translation inefficient, I develop scripts for various interactions, do plenty of research to ensure lexical and syntactic accuracy, and practice selfish altruism hedge my social bets.

Overreaction, in this scenario, was a safe bet, even here.
What's the p for???
PLTR is interesting as they operate with the data governance environment created by our elected officials. In theory, as they will routinely state, we have selected this data governance environment as voters and they are playing by the same rules as everyone else. 

PLTR gets a lot more negative attention because they are explicitly profiting from large GOVT players in crisis scenarios and are enabled by the data governance environment in place.  

Therefore $PLTR can be interpreted as evil because their platform helps governments find & subsequently kill terries.

The Mittal wedding seems conservative. Given that 4th Richest means the 60-70mil was probably less than 1% of net worth. 

Average American wedding $30k. Would imply the average American couple has net worth of $3mil

Mittal was conservative. Knew the maximum amount he needed to spend, didn’t hurt his net worth and made headlines for his legacy. Calculated.

The success rate of a yolo like that(turning something like $80K into $800K) is probably \~2% for the average WSB dweller.

Something that low of a success rate should never "feel like the only way out". 98% of people who do it end up way worse off, and would rather have never lost the $80K in the first place.

I mean. The share price for this delivery number should not be higher then it was a few montsh ago. This is way overvalued. They dont build anything themselves or spend money on innovations and factories and stuff. The share price when it was 3-10 dollars is more correct even for todays numbers. This is still only next Tesla FOMO shit in play. I hope it ends well for nio. But when tesla releases a cheaper car and in also in china. Good luck all others that dont build anything themselves. There is no room to compete with their prices. Only if they sell at loss.

Big brain meme... me no understand
Didn't papa musk say that might be in 3 years? And still at $25k the barrier to entry (uber drivers/ genz etc) is much higher than the estimated $600 a month. Every lyft/uber driver could afford to have a new EV vehicle that seats 7... uber has 4 million drivers worldwide... 

Just different. Tesla is cool and all but Canoo is cheaper and more customizable with more potential design options. Both will succeed but the "next tesla" is currently only 13.70 a share and they're about to announce their first big b2b partnership.  Gaps were filled and we're about to take off.
This is the way, but after the news of them getting their dick slapped for exclusivity arrangements. Then OTM calls print a week later.
Better opportunities elsewhere
Prob not but I'm gonna buy calls anyway.

Is fuckn disappointing, so much potential, maybe I should sell so it finally takes off for you guys
You guys have parents??
As amazing as Jack has been for BABA he may be seen as a liability to long term growth because of CCP conflict.  The recent sell off might be equally caused by his anti CCP comments and with him out of the way this stock could moon.  Just a thought either way I'm averaging down until I'm broke.

How utterly unprofessional of them. $GME to the moon 🚀
What more is it? A battery company lmao? More than a car company is such a fucking weak answer. Nio makes almost all of its money from selling cars and that will never change. 

How much money should Nio make to justify being valued higher than another car company that made 172 billion last year? Less than 5 billion according to brainlets like you.
> The argument is that if you burn more oil making an EV car battery than a normal car burns in its life time then the EV didn’t really have a net positive impact. Which used to be the case

This claim is not true, nor was it ever true.  This claim [wasn't true when it was first made against the Prius](https://np.reddit.com/r/teslamotors/comments/2kou6r/does_anyone_know_what_happens_to_the_batteries/clnlkue/) fourteen years ago, and [it's not true now against EVs](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/es903729a) either.

>Ten years ago the greenest vehicle on the planet was not an EV, it was a Ford F-150, because the manufacturing process was simple. Typically the manufacturing process is more harmful to the environment than the driving part

As per the lifecycle analyses in the above link, this is also false.  For any given car, the driving part is far more harmful to the environment than the manufacturing process.  That's why hybrids and EVs, with their significantly higher operational efficiency, are in fact greener than gas cars.

Should buy PLTR a little lower just in case it is boring imho
Lets go Eagles

Lets go Cramer
Actually, I find your question the easy one to answer.  Even if people are buying homes like hotcakes now, that will stop even with added inventory in 6 months due to the fact the folks currently looking to buy will have already bought by late 2021.  They won't need to buy any more.

Now, sure - in the future, there will be potential buyers who will be the primary occupants of the purchased homes out there.  Trouble is - they may be part of the unemployed, and no one may want to loan them money for a home.

&#x200B;

Let's say they have just enough money in a shoebox to actually pay cash for a home, but after that they're wiped out - they're still unemployed, so they don't have money for food, utilities, or taxes.  If they don't get work to pay for these basic things to stay alive and especially the property taxes - once that tax bill goes delinquent, they'll lose the house and all the money they've sunk into it.  Better to keep that cash available to pay for food and rent, instead - until an alternative comes along.

So, potential buyers who will be the primary occupants are out.

&#x200B;

Historically, people/entities who acquire a large number of vacant properties are landlord types who purchased them as an investment.  After the recent debacle with the moratorium on evictions and inability to collect rent - If I had the cash to buy up a block of homes come late 2021 and turn them into rentals, I'd walk away and invest in something else.

Possibly the only way I'd even consider doing this is if I could get guaranteed payment - say, get all of the rent from the tenant up front when they sign the lease, or some guarantee from the government that I'll get some sort of payment/bailout should we have another disaster like COVID.  The likelihood of either of these events happening is slim to none, so again - I'll look at other investments instead.

There will always be speculators in any situation.  Trouble is with the housing situation, the ROI on housing tends to be fixed at whatever the current market will bear.  If a two-bedroom house is renting for $1500 a month in Anywhere, USA - you simply cannot charge $4000 a month for the same type of property in Anywhere, USA to hedge against another COVID event.  The only folks who can approach these sorts of prices are the AirBnB types, and as previously posted, they are not immune from COVID-like events:

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/komxj9/potential\_in\_coming\_real\_estate\_dip\_in\_2021\_are/ghsau01/?utm\_source=reddit&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/komxj9/potential_in_coming_real_estate_dip_in_2021_are/ghsau01/?utm_source=reddit&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

The only group I can think of who would be willing to buy this property are the sorts who buy and hold for long periods of time - 50 to 100 years and up.  Entities who speculate on real estate long term, who are in a position to weather a COVID-like crisis knowing that over time, real estate prices always go up because - the population continues to grow, and no one is making any more real estate.

These entities will want to buy as cheap as possible.  So, they'll wait until the market bottoms out, and then start buying up.  I feel that's where this is headed.

On a final note - if I were into this sort of investment as a speculator, I'd ignore all the empty houses and probably start buying up vacant commercial real estate that's been on the market for too long in places like Manhattan and the downtown L. A. Area.  Eventually, that stuff will come back price-wise due to their locations.

\[If I were looking for a home in these areas, I'd still consider commercial property which I could get rezoned so I could live in it.  Square footage is square footage, and all that...\]
Are they grossly over priced, low volume with big spreads, or actually playable?

If you like RKT, you'll love GHIV. Everybody calls UWM  an RKT clone, but everyone I know in the business despises Quicken but loves UWM. Got in on RKT at 18 and out at 22. In on GHIV for 1100 shares at 10.5. RKT has advertising going for it - that's it. Their process is a convoluted cluster fuck of untrained pleebs. GHIV is a winner.

Do some cocaine you pussy
Yeah I should’ve specified more - I meant if you look at the 1W - 1M chart it’s had a sharp decline back and forth to incline so I was thinking of waiting for the next decline or just buy “top”
Although an outlier, where i live housing is now priced higher than the 08 crash. Im not sure how the bubble didnt pop when lockdown happened
Just saw its down again, buying dem calls if the pre market green dildos don't get there first
you're fine
Isn't the Great Boomer Die-Off supposed to make the value crash when their kids/the state sell their 8 houses and 4 lakeside properties? What gives?
Your wife's boyfriend is supposed to be doing the fucking while you're supposed to be doing the YOLOing.  Get your shit together.
Do you mean weekly calls?  If so, yes we do
Always start low bro. If that works then you can only go up up up (literally)

Earth diamonds are by NO MEANS rare or practical. The diamond industry is quite shady and keeps the supply artificially low to make it seem that they are rare. Marketing has also made it seem that real diamonds are a MUST for engagement and jewelry in general.

It’s probably the biggest scam of any industry in my opinion.
Well now you’re both. 🏳️‍🌈🐻
I was given 500$ to invest and I put every penny in Nio. I have 789$ right now. They are Tesla’s biggest competitor and will have full reign of the biggest EV market (China) as they continue to grow more. Do your own research, but Tesla quintupled this year and I expect their competitor to do great in the stock market too as EV’s are the future. Nio all the way, there’s a lot of catalysts coming up and I don’t think you would be disappointed dumping some money in and seeing how it goes. Cheers

I did but I never know how much to put or risk it never being matched so I just do close to the current last bid/ask ?

my PLTR is a 2.91 limit (it closed at 2.91 so should I do lower?)

Rocket should be trading closer to $40. It was so frustrating holding Rocket through both of its fantastic earnings without any sign of going up. So I sold and will probably get back in in March.

I agree alot of upside in the stock.
Just word of advice. Look at their comment and post history. If they were right on previous analysis then they're probably right again. But if they're just retards that recently joined or made a new account dont listen to them. Too many newcomers think they're smart and give themselves more credit than they deserve. They give out shitty tickers and they need to stop because they're blocking out the actual DDs

Often they loweball the target price at start of the growth, so the street can accumulate at great price.

Fisker is definitely like Nikola in the sense that all they have is design, and want someone to build it for them. Fisker has no engineering competence, no proprietary technology and zero track record of success. After screwing over Lord Musk, he is a pariah in the automotive industry, and starting this company is the only way he can have gainful employment. Also, it’s great that he’s hired his wife as the COO and his daughter in marketing. Definitely not like Trevor Milton hiring his brother for the Director of Hydrogen Production/Infrastructure.

Yeah, Fidelity often gives me a fill that splits the bid/ask even when I put in a limit sell order at the bid price.

They have a useful logo to show when price was improved as well as a cumulative price improvement page. Without that, it would be hard to know that they're getting good fills.

Lastly, one of Fidelity's marketing points is "commitment to execution quality", so they are the only major broker I know of that doesn't engage in Payment for Order Flow.

At this point it's not ideal, but if interest rates were higher (locking in income) or falling (bond gains value and can be sold) it can be a viable strategy.  My grandparents bought 30 year treasuries near the high at either 12 or 14% and made out like bandits for decades.

No, like driving across country with no means of lining up a job first or having money for groceries. I heard of one famous Vietnam war correspondent who had less than 5 bucks when he landed in Saigon only to get a job offer over the phone the next day.

Console refresh will be a dribble because of the supply issues. I think the consoles really just open the gates for the high margin software sales (ie games) on new gen. Gamers have been saving gaming dollars to spend on new gen, and once hardware has saturated more market, we'll see how well the games sell.
No one thinks that. Dems are in the pockets of big corps and big tech helped them steal election

Back in their day 10-years we’re going for 8%, brokers charged $50 a trade, and CAPE was cheap. 

Yields are zero, trading’s been made “free” and gamified, and the mainstream keeps coming up with new metrics to pretend evaluations aren’t beyond the pale by any other standard. All that and a global debt load that will need to be reduced through a left or right tail event? Why wouldn’t we take some risk to win today when tomorrow seems so hopeless?

Honestly I wouldn’t be surprised about a crash they’re pretty common, not for the reason the people around you are talking about though.
I don't want political debates in this sub, but I think the issue with the stimulus payments is that they're not directed properly to the people who truly need them.

I'm a (currently wfh) software engineer that doesn't deserve a stimulus whatsoever. But I got both; YOLO'ed them into penny stocks & $BABA calls and they're gone now.
Need to take that up with OP.  Biden the socialist is completely absurd and only in this country would people think he is left wing in the slightest.  As AOC said shouldn't even be in the same party.  I was just saying OP at least owns his opinion even if don't agree with it in the slightest.

This is an incredibly short-sighted opinion. There is a ton of space in the EV industry and it is the future of land-based travel, which will be around for a long time. As long as they're managed well and continue to innovate and grow with the tech upgrades, the future is limitless for these EV companies. Nio will find their niche.

I'd say if people in Australia or Japan were concerned they may be overdoing it, but I personally know at least 15 people who've died from Covid in Kansas (yes, tiny nowhere land). The US has dropped the ball in the worst way and is still fumbling.

I think the word you're missing is... yet. Although the vaccine is rolling out, with the new strain we're going to get a math lesson in exponents because a lot of American's aren't able to do anything that's mildly inconveniencing like wearing a mask and limiting travel, church, parties, bars, restaurants.

That said, I've burned my bear suit and realized the market doesn't give a fuck about the stacks of dead bodies as long as the printer's full of ink, so I'm balls deep in clean energy and ARK LEAPs.
If you have a tax lawyer or accountant, and you need to do an MTM election past the due date, this case is an example of how and under what circumstances an extension from the IRS can be sought, and they (ie, your tax lawyer and/or accountant) may find it useful: [https://casetext.com/case/vines-v-commr-of-internal-revenue](https://casetext.com/case/vines-v-commr-of-internal-revenue)

Hear hear, great advice. As a general rule, always set the taxman's pound of flesh aside. 

For those who trade with sufficient frequency to be considered "traders" within the meaning of 26 USC 475(f), take a look at this opinion from the Tax Court to get a general idea of how a mark-to-market election can help you, as well as the timeframe for filing the election with your return (and also how to request an extension if you really get into trouble).

It depends on if I think the stock could keep going up.  I had a 300% increase on Carnival options a few weeks ago but I didn't sell because with the vaccine news and optimism it seemed like it could keep going up.

Then England was all "Oi mates ther a new virus straihn" and the options went down.

Still made about 150% on it so not horrible on an investment, but that 300% equaled to about 10% of my portfolio...

DIS OTM leaps has volatility of 35% right now, very low comparing to most techs out there (often in the range of 50-100%). So IV crush is not a concern, and more likely to increase as stock continues to rise.

I personally have no plan to sell any DIS stock / leap til at least 2022, and am continue adding every quarter, bc I think streaming will break into 150M subscriber in a year. 
Assuming Macro situation remains as it is now, my current target price for DIS is 200-300 in 2021, and 300-400 in 2022--2023.

Your wagon only has half a wheel there, buddy. In fact that's not even a wheel, you're just selling covered calls.

A proper wheel has two sides: Cash Secured Puts (short put with cash collateral if made to buy the shares) and Covered Calls (short call with stock collateral if made to sell the shares). It's a wheel because it's a cyclical progression.

CSP -> exercised -> CC -> exercised -> CSP -> etc

The CSP portion saves you from the retardation that is

basically no-brainer BUY,

TSLA - 705.67 - delivered 499550

NIO -   48.74 - delivered 43728

499550 / 43728 = 11.42

So expected NIO price = 705.67/11.42 = 61.79

OR expected TSLA price = 48.74 \*11.42 =  556 , but AS BOTH companies smashed expectation, pretty sure TSLA goes to 800, and nio to 70 in 3 months

Actually fair question, I don't see this asked very often. Chinese car buying is much more cash buy/financed, as opposed to leasing. Additionally unless you're above the upper middle-class, getting a new car is kind of a challenge because the license plate is Lottery-based for non-EV's.

He said he tried appealing but they couldn't care less.

I have enough capital for the premium, but not enough to exercise the contract (to buy the stock).If the option turns out ITM could I instead sell it, basically like a future, and what percentage of its value could i get
Cathie “has been” fucking from a young age
I think NuScale's going to atleast be able to build one reactor there are so many interested parties. As to why its down since October, the* market has been focusing on missed earnings. But if you ask me the fact that they've stopped the asset impairments and are net income positive is a major win. The turnaround is starting to succeed that Plus oil prices are also starting to see some life as the economy reopens I dont expect this to be a long term growth driver but it could be a nice bump. Keep in mind dominos was the 2nd or 3rd best preforming stock of the last 10 years (may have changed since I last looked) and that was a turnaround stock with a good growth story. A sucessful turnaround could yeild big gains.

Another point to mention is the float is very small at 115m, if 70% is shorted and over 15m shares are being bought back, that means if the price moves up, it will move up very quickly since such a small float is available to purchase.

What I was ultimately curious about was, based on your comments was that you seemed to think Tesla is able to continue their high CAGR and meet the 20 million/year target in 2030, right? What are your thoughts about analysts predictions that total worldwide sales for BEVs are going to be something like 15 million per year, and high end estimates for world wide battery production of 2.5 TWh assuming ALL batteries were used for 70 kWh/car would be max of 35 million vehicles total per year (this ignores literally any other use of the batteries).

Like all the idiots say. TESLAS NOT A CAR COMPANY

Neurallink sky net spacex. 

They all ran by Elon

Only public is Tesla

I’m so mad my novel was taken away from me

So I’ll leave you with a TLDR 

Tesla is the first public company that tried to change the world for the better, not just with products but an ideology. 

Tesla will dominate, they are not a car company: they have software, products, data retention. 

Every car sold, has someone driving it which collect an absurd amount of data on driving habits and road conditions WORLDWIDE. 

bruh. This is not a car company but an AI powerhouse.

I don't think you understand what stats arb is. They find two highly correlated instruments and when the correlation breaks down they will buy one and sell the other creating a spread trade expecting the correlation to come back into force and the spread to close.
So in this case they will sell steel futures and buy MT stock.
Bc most are broke on this site and don't know what it means to work.

Idk where else to share this observation but this sub is basically my last bastion on Reddit so I’ll do it here 

I remember some time ago a video got posted on Reddit of Scientologists and how they emotionally manipulate the people who left them or publicly disagreed with their practices.  Videos of Scientology church reps telling these people how they are “unstable” and “need help” and “aren’t fit for society”

Obviously people were like “oh wow, what horrible tactics. Why would you do this to people who simply disagree with you?”

Fast forward to 2020. 

I make a comment on r/coronavirus about how the average age of death is higher than the US life expectancy, how fat people are the vast majority of premature deaths, and how anyone healthy under 50 has a higher likelihood of dying in a car crash than from covid. 

First it rains downvotes. Then come the comments. 

“You sound unstable”

“You need help man”

“People like you aren’t fit for society”

It’s simultaneously poetic and pathetic

Going against meme stock. GL.
1) That's not science. It's an article, mostly opinion.

2) The post doesn't even talk about viral transmission, it mentions droplet aerosols which have dubious (none) causal link to viral spread.

3) International data b/w mask v no mask countries confirm the assertion they do nothing.  Though, it's on mask advocates to prove efficacy.

4) Sources cited at the bottom are a joke.  BLM and protests?  GTFO.  This is political nonsense, not real science.

Here's a real source with real scientific, peer-reviewed, randomized controlled studies...

"In pooled analysis, we found no significant reduction in influenza transmission with the use of face masks (RR 0.78, 95% CI 0.51–1.20; I2 = 30%, p = 0.25)"

what are your entry levels for NIO weeklies tomorrow?
I agree with you. That’s why I followed with the confusion for short squeeze vs bull trend. Timing the sell on a short squeeze is much harder than selling close to the top on a bull trend. Nailing that on a short squeeze is a skill I confidently feel much of this sub including myself lacks that’s pretty much all I was saying.

RT-RPA is not sensitive enough and has serious specificity issues. RPA is also expensive and tricky to handle. Developing this on an industrial level is unlikely. There’s a reason no RPA-CRISPR assays have made it through FDA approval. Even SHERLOCK only had their RT-LAMP assay approved and they never even published it (just published by another group two weeks ago). Besides Doudna’s group developed something similar without RPA involved and just LbuCas13a. That will get approved before this does. Lastly, the companies that will sell this are probably not publicly traded. Should look into who would manufacture it (TMO).

Blown transmission is on a 2006 impala SS which is great because they hold their value like donkey shit, so I’m pretty much at a complete loss on that.

Coolant leak on an 06 WRX which I’m not too worried about, shouldn’t be bad. Still annoying as hell though
Unfortunately it will probably happen

Feels bad for the fools that bought in

It was a good run from 15 to 31
When the CCP can fuck over one of the largest shareholders how is that bullish for other investors?

Not only can they make Jack Ma’s shares go to zero - they can make his life expectancy go to zero

Dysuria (painful urination) can be caused by Chlamydia, Gonorrhoea, or HIV. If it’s one of the first two, they’re both bacterial so you can take antibiotics to fix it. If it’s HIV... well yeah. 

Considering symptoms set in within 72 hours, it’s probably a bacterial issue. Go get that checked out before your urethra is full of mucous discharge and really hurts like hell.

And then Jack Ma comes out the back room with a basket of flowers and tells you to short BABA.
If you have this issue depending on how quickly you absorb information you probably need to spend six months to a year maybe 3 running through Market history one bar at a time, so that you understand how a trend looks and when it ends.

The best way to go about this is set money aside for the IRS at the start of the year, and then YOLO it into PLTR and GME calls. That way, the money you’ve set aside for tax should have at least tripled and that way you’ll effectively pay tax and still have profit. Win - win ???

Usually a week to a month. Stocks too bullish to go further out. Always OTM. The premiums for Tesla for weekly OTM are really high now anyways due to stock price, IV etc.  Depends on how I see the stock going or if there are catalysts like delivery. Judgment calls. Usually pick a strike where I’d be happy to lose the stock to anyways. 

Almost got wrecked on battery day though but the dip afterward saved me, and the battery day dip was the last time I purchased $TSLA stock to my stack. Won’t be buying anymore stock going forward.

BREAKING: Jack Ma off the BABA board of directors as CEO. Xi Jinping reportedly heard yelling JACK MA OFF for 8-10 minutes. His secretary who was in the room for the conversation with the BABA board says it was very intense.

The reason arbitrage analysis doesn't work is because very rarely is an opportunity allowed to exist for long. Steel prices and demand are TEMPORARY. The market is forward looking. It makes no sense to assume that steel will just continue to climb. Therefore MT will go up when steel prices normalize. Institutions understand that steel will not remain this high for long, so it makes no sense to push MT that high yet.
BREAKING🚫 : Jack Ma spotted by TMZ making sweet love to Hilary Clinton. No further comments were made by AliBaba

National treasure is fucking bullshit.

Nick Cage throws away 50 years of 401k and Roth contributions, shares and real estate appreciation and his dads and grandpas inheritance to find the supposedly greatest deposit of gold while browsing /r/conspiracy sprinkled with specks of /r/neckbeard 

They almost die multiple times and end up finding it (what the fuck) but then immediately sell the whole fucking mound of the shit while gold values are at $400 USD an ounce. (Right now hovering $2000)

On top of that they only got to keep 1% instead of the 10% suggested by the feds because Cage wanted the treasure to belong to the people. 

Throw some more horse shit on top, because they sold on the first year it was found, according to the US Supreme Court decision in 1969 (nice), you have to pay Uncle Sam a buried treasure tax.

Afterwards, they use that money to buy a 2005 Ferrari with vanity plates on some /r/wallstreetbets shit and a gigantic house while property values are at an all time high (hello 2008 prime mortgage crash) in a state with one of the highest property taxes. They definitely got fucked in the ass in 2008.

No wonder they had to go on more treasure hunts. What in the Roth IRA fuck did I just watch? Fucking buy some TSLA calls. Fuck.

Its actually one of the healthiest ways to cook things. 

"Whenever you cook food, you’ll have some loss of nutrients,” says registered dietician and certified food scientist Catherine Adams Hutt, RD, Ph.D. "The best cooking method for retaining nutrients is one that cooks quickly, exposes food to heat for the smallest amount of time and uses only a minimal amount of liquid."

Guess what? Microwave cooking does that."

Forward PE is also pretty high lol they need to pull something crazy off to increase their revenue and profits. Also, not to be a doomsayer, but I'm a believer that these valuations especially on tech and EV can't last forever unless they keep printing to maintain inflow of cash into the market to make sure stonks go up. Not gonna say too much here, but unless they're going to abandon the dollar, I don't think they can prop it up forever at least at this rate of increase. I'll just keep dancing to the music, but I'll always keep myself prepared for it to stop lol

Dice onions, and fry them until golden.

Dump in a can of petite diced tomatoes. Add cumin, paprika, and some harissa.

 Make a small space in the sauce so you can crack in an egg. Make as many spaces for as many as you like.

Don’t mix the eggs or anything, throw a lid on it for a while until the eggs are cooked to your preference.

Once done you can sprinkle on some feta or goat cheese with parsley.

This recipe is called Shashuka.

Enjoy.

Honestly GME bulls I hope you get all the tendies you deserve but the opportunity value you lose while all your ducks are tied up in one basket I just won’t get. People are confusing short squeeze with bull trend here. A short squeeze is a blip a bull trend provides for months/ years. Maybe GME is the future but the street knows there is huge retail interest in the stock they will manipulate the fuck out of it shorts or no shorts. Will GME hit $100 a share? Probably. Is there something else out there you could 5x or 10x your money with that stands a better chance with a quicker timeline and in a better sector/ industry that will let you sleep soundly at night? Probably. GLTA may Cohen be with you.

I’d say the closer it gets to the point, the more likely something ballistic will happen (based off past confirmed bull flags) and since this is a “bull flag” my judgement leans towards the underlying stock shooting up, however there is a strong support bar at 23 and another support at 21 although not as strong, with those two observations I have considerable confidence in PLTR staying on the bull run, if you look at most stocks trading on the S&P 500, they all have this bull flag pattern so another theory is year long bull run on SPY; SPY 400c 2/19 VXX 18p 2/19

The skateboard tech allows them to build 1 thing really well and they can partner with any brand for their top hats or build and sell their own. Their 1 skateboard allows them to sell last mile delivery vans, RVs, food trucks, minivans, sedans, pickup trucks and sports cars all on one platform. 

They have several decades of car manufacturing experience. Elon was learning as he goes and he's doing great, but he's facing lawsuits and still only built 500k this year while BMW sold over 2.5 million and Hyundai sold over 7.4 million.

Tesla is the Bently of EV and Canoo will be the Ford/Hyundai of EV. So, yes GOEV will outsell Tesla in the long run.
The problem is it’s not the next TSLA.  They are only going to do well in their home country.

Yeah 😅... Imagine. I mean I took calls but I was bearish at the time and still am.
I only trust DD written by retards. This DD comes off arrogant and smug.
Lol, im not going to do a full write up on a company for some random dude.
I'm going short regardless. NIO looks more like a mitsubishi than anything else. Looks count as well as current popularity.
ah I see, he only learned how to count to 3 so far, well that's good, I'm only at 5 right now, hopefully we'll all get to 1 million soon

Just out of curiosity, I've seen a lot of these but have avoided MT in particular due to their declining financials.

What was MT's P/E and P/S during the previous times when steel was @ 900/1000? How does that compare to current P/E or P/S?

They have divested their American holdings because they were losing money and margins across the rest of the globe won't perform well with the dollar falling.

Just curious about the broader trends that we may need to consider here rather than just, steel goes up, MT goes 🚀🚀.

Nope. Cooks em fast. I can do a single egg in 30 seconds.
Fuck yes, diamond hands on Nio pays off. I was planning on buying more before the weekend but forgot about it being closed friday, kinda bummed about that. Still buying more this week in preparation for Nio day on the 9th! Nio gang wya??

Pull backs Happen and my TSLA stock is a multi bagger that most people here can’t even get with options. I’m making great income on selling covered calls for ages that I’d still be green af if the stock crashed even 70%. 

That being said TSLA is a exponentially growing company and not just automotive focused. I’m still a bull, and I’ll hand it to the bears if they get the “Tesla popping like dotcom bubble “ sort of pullback. 

Only time will tell. Bears may be correct once in two decades but they’ve lost a ton of money and even one of the biggest  stock gains in the past years.

Waiting until marriage is an indicator of solid conviction, but probably a little misplaced with a dash of lack of critical thinking. I just don't see why on earth you would marry someone before you explore your sexual compatibility with someone it makes it seem like you'd value the social perception of marriage more than the marriage itself.

Not saying anything about TSLA. I like what they're trying to do, but the fact that they're overvalued CURRENTLY is pretty much undisputable by any metrics. Who knows? Maybe they'll pull off something crazy and grow their revenue into their valuation in the very near future. 

The only reason I don't want to buy into TSLA is solely because there are better opportunities out there especially in the short term. I swing trade and there are so many other opportunities to make money instead of putting my money in something that's already thousands of %s lol
Watch plenty of Warren Buffet videos/interviews. Read the intelligent investor. Make one option trade. Become addicted. Assume more risk with each trade, until your wife/gf leaves you. Sell your house's equity and use it to buy more options. WARNING, in order for this to work NEVER perform self-assessment. Never think. Just do.

You guys are fucktards.  Your YAS queen, Cathie Wood has been buying up BABA and tencent.  Yet you bash BABA and chinese arovms and say they are POS stock.

BABA is the best value and growth stock in the world right now because of chinese stimulus to increase domestic consumption from their dual circulation economic policy and because AliCloud will be the biggest cloud company in 10 years.

The negative you posted can all be drawn with crayons on a chart
Just don't use robinhood and use limit orders. I have schwab, TD, and tasty works. Price improvement are pretty common if your limit order is at ask on liquid stocks. 

I use tasty works for option plays over robinhood as well. Sure it cost ~1 per contract but they more often than not fill below ask compared to robinhood which will never.

Mindmed. It’s going to change the way these lame boomers look at mental health. 


The current state of mindmed = OMG SHROOM STOCK LOL LOOK AT HOW WELL WEED DID LUL. 

The way I look at mindmed, never really wrote this out before but I’m going to get balls deep: 

- SHROOMS have not been been advertised this heavily ever in history to be used medicinally, besides when Tim Leary killed half of his students and ruined the psychedelic space( I know this is completely inaccurate but you get the gist, and fuck if you don’t do some Google searches on Tim Leary) the simple fact that this company has opened doors and old studies to perfecting the isolation of pscilocibin, lsd and dmt to help mental health ina therapeutic setting is outstanding, I really don’t think people understand shrooms unless you done them or know there history. 

- DNA. DNA. DNA. 

DNA. 

Yeah I said it. DNA. YOU probably thinking wtf is this mans on about. Well James and Watson crick. DISCOVERED the double helix within DNA after they tripped balls on LSD, went back at the cross section and essentially realized that DNA has a double helix. The amount of times I learned this shit in my undergrad for biology was absurd. 

I kept thinking, wait a sec, why is LSD illegal, if one of the most astounding components known to man has been discovered under the influence of lsd. 

The current mental health space is a huge sector and completely overlooked, people that are rich don’t want to solve people’s medical issues( especially when it comes to mental health) psychiatrists , Pharmacists and doctors all benefit from mental health illnesses. However once mindmed is able to administer lsd with a psychiatrist on site I can garuntee people who experimented before will be open to this therapy, and people who haven’t will be more open because of the doctors on site. 

Along with it being federally legislated. 

I am very confident on mindmed and the future of psychedelics on mental health.

Edit: yes I think being able to do lsd shrooms and dmt in a setting with a doctor on site is fucking game changing.
The funny thing is it’s hardly a trap. Black not taking the white pawn is really just beginner level ‘don’t be completely braindead because the reward is clearly not worth the loss’.

Which actually suits WSB extremely well now that I think about it.

Why don't boomers understand forward earnings? The price for Tesla as a multiple of revenue hasn't increased that much since 2014, although some.

By every technical and fundamental metric I think a pullback to 680 is so very reasonable but that doesn’t mean it will happen. People have been saying the same thing since it was 680 pre split. Also Tesla shorts lost more cash than the whole airline industry this past year. That hurts

What's not the point? Everything I said still stands. Analysts have already said they expect numbers to keep going and have priced that into new targets.

I am aware Nio day is coming up. If the company comes out with some solid news/offerings/technology then it will go up. If they disappoint/response is tepid, could see a sell the news event. I am just pointing out previous reactions to sell numbers. I'm not claiming to know exactly what will happen. None of us know - saying numbers are up so stock goes up isn't a guarantee either.

Not everyone YOLOs.

Im in since the 6s. I can't allocate 100% of my portfolio into GME and I was already with too much exposure. 

I sold 20k of 40k shares into strength and rebought 70 5.5c after the last CC because fuck the bears.

I know that when it squeezes REALLY HARD im selling a part of that, but im keeping at least 10k shares.

I hold a stock because I would buy it if it wasn't already in my portfolio.
Damn yo if I invested into the stock market back in 1792 I would be rich

my shares and calls hope so!
Wouldn't the play here to be to invest in theater companies with better financials?
Alexa play Runnin' (Dying to Live)
Probably a more reliable metric, 

I compared the cumulative PnL of the 3 and that solved it.
Please CCP... He's been educated enough 😭😭😭😭😭

Nkla went through a reverse merger, that’s the only reason they are public right now! You got a MBA and you still think nio valuation makes sense? Good luck, i just hope this post will not convince a gullible 2020 newbie trader to invest in this fugazi
You're right stocks are a zero sum game. You buy at the top, fgt who bought early gets rich while you diamond hand a dead zombie stock with no future 🤡 like I said any of them can prove me wrong and make you retards wet with excitement by buying the top but greed is an  interesting thing :)

IPOC is about to print at open tomorrow
For those holding BABA, TME and other Chinese tech stocks keep in mind Chinese execs have been grabbing up property in places like London, Paris, NY (they single handing keeping Manhattan prices from crashing). Most of their families are here so they are definitely planning to cash out and escape from China
Sir, this is a Wendy’s.
Now that I think about it, as everyone is on the iphone dick even though it's grossly overpriced but they do so because it's cool, I don't see NIO eating TESLAs lunch.

Yeah, there’s Apple too. We got lot of mega corps (there is another one I am forgetting) that have recently (and unexpectedly) turned their attention to this intelligent/EV tech. These guys have money and resources and can see things mere mortals can’t. Maybe the cloud, smartphones, social whatever etc are maxed out. They’re looking for a the next thing. The next Big thing.
Already exists. $COKE
Am I the only one expecting a TSLA pullback tomorrow ?

Jack Ma should quit China if he’s still alive. Flee to the west with nothing but the shirt on his back, and build it all back up again like the G he is.
Jack Ma conspiracists - I have personal knowledge of Chinese prisons. The game plan is very simple. Make the prisons as remote as possible so that even escape would mean certain death. Conditions are on the very dire side of livable. This time of year would be bitter cold. They have enough clothes and bedding to survive but not enough to be remotely comfortable. They work all day. Many in hard labor cracking rocks. Many "lucky" ones doing field work growing their own food or peeling potatoes and garlic. Nobody gets a forgiving or understanding look from the guards with steel hearts. Every act is at the end of a barrel or blade. Anyone who questions the government may get "lost" there and never see their family again.

If coke becomes legal and a coke producer ipos jim cramer is gonna be on mad money saying he knows the ceo and hes a money maker and i will be holding calls
I know it seems suspicious he disappeared right when the CCP took issue with him, but just take a real look at a picture of Jack Ma for a moment.

It's obvious he just wrapped up his millenium long ethnographic survey of Earth and has simply returned to his home planet.
No lmfao whatever the cars worth you gotta make double
Same, I added it to my watchlist in October and it's down 11% since but what NuScale are doing is very promising. Small nuclear reactors could see great growth in the next decade. I just haven't pulled the trigger yet.
I think the idea is to catch the run-up and sell before earnings are actually released
Makes sense to me
Of course but maybe buy second hand unless u earn major kank
I always thought they were saying Buy Hoes, Buy Hoes, it's off to work we go.

As in their motivation for working was to buy whores due to being vertically challenged, old and ugly.

Good bot
Yes, that’s the idea

ARKG and AMD 100%. Unless they are retarded OTM
I understand all of that, just seeing now i read your question wrong my bad. I didnt realize you meant they aren’t buying bonds at all, and i also read your prior comment where you asked the question “So they’re buying stocks”. Sincere apologies, well informed friend.
I am skeptical of any Chinese company tbh, you say anything against the emperor and you get taken down no matter how rich you are.
Just because you are merging with them, doesn’t give you the right to steal from them Ackman.

Not any more than any of his other rallies. Those that know the law know that there is a near zero chance of the results being overturned at this point.

I believe in the fundamental re-rating thesis with any squeeze-like price action as an extra dollop of whipped cream. Current management offers upside from here. Ryan Cohen offers much more, IMO. I’ve had a majority of my net worth in GameStop since 2019.
That’s not the point. Entire forecast is good for the coming year and NIO day is next week.

I'm sorry you shorted and lost all you money, or just never bought and missed the ride. I feel bad for you bro.

Oof man I'm just a rando on here but I could see between 60/70. I don't think we are seeing much explosive growth for a few years now based on they needed another equity offering to 'expand research and development'.

With EV being the only player in China by end of decade I see it starting to really explosively grow (all China EVs) by 2025

For me it’s a matter of sometimes I can’t afford it, and lately I get high and go to sleep almost immediately. As in I’m going to bed, not just zonking out cuz I’m high. Doing that is actually kinda helping me, honestly. I don’t get to experience the high, my body gets the fix though and can wean off, I don’t get hooked to the high because I’m unaware of it, and it ultimately becomes a waste. Has been pretty effective thus far.
Oh, Melvin is gonna get his shorts unravelled  alright, to make way for the biggest green dildo in history.

Yep, and what is an ETF made up of?  Already existing debt.  They are not funding the issuance of new debt.  They're buying already existing debt from the debt holders as a way to improve liquidity in financial markets.  That is extremely different from what you think it is.

Is TSLA deliveries a sell the news event? Have they been priced in?
"I'll handle the business side"
Are there any petitions or twitter hashtags about it? #WheresJack a thing? Anyone demanding to know his whereabouts? No. 

And the only reason this is being talked about is because he quit a reality TV show that was filmed back in November.

Jack Ma is practicing the ancient Chinese art of STFU. That's bullish to me.
I can't wait to see Peter Thiel pump a big ass Mithril nut into this stock around lockup expiry.
I need to learn to be more patient with my positions. I exit them too soon, and after I exit they often the direction I wanted them to. 

Happens so much! 

But at the same time, doesn't mean I should diamond hand everything. 

I think I should hold my ARKG calls and my AMD calls, but my BABA leaps? 

Maybe I should hold those too, since they're for June 2022, but I also feel like I could put the money into something that could move up faster...?
Booty Finger Time? Lovely.
Jack ma is alive and chilling on a beach with Tupac, Biggie, and Jeffery Epstein
Market. Open. Now.
There’s such a big difference between missing and keeping a low profile.
Yeah but we’re talking about their recent ER right here as specified in the earlier comment
Pretty sure just speculation... I have a feeling we'll find Ma bright and ready with a "completely different view of the situation"
Ok, just shopping around for tomorrow. Thanks for the input!
It'll melt up until NIO day, I'm exiting my position on the 8th and reloading after since It'll be a sell the news I'm thinking

Lmao thats the Investor Spirit. Jack didnt even say anything bad, just that less regulation would be better, the CCP is really fucking over anyone who doesnt pray to Xi every morning
Good question
Any idea how low $baba can go on the Ma is missing news?!
Bro, you don’t need to lie for internet points.
Lol no buddy wait for it to go to 20 if youre actually serious. Easy to buy this $18 dip but not so easy to buy at 20 if youre actually serious. Lot of yall are "opportunists" not gamblers
Hard to say in the post-S&P world. At this point most of the shares are being held long-term, so it's up in the air.


Delivery numbers good, news cycle about maybe being 450 cars short of 500k deliveries in 2020 bad. If people start talking about China chomping at the bit for the Model Y Black Friday style (sure would be nice if Tesla had a PR team..) and ditching NIO reservations for it, could start a good upswing going into earnings.


Expect a drop to $685, be satisfied if flat, don't hope or pray for $750 so if it happens you'll be psyched.

Rule 5: No mentioning of Jack Ma
Looking ahead 20 years from now, I believe that financial outlooks for many will be dire. However, with lots of ppl investing and getting second jobs, it’s not that difficult to realize that there will be a polarization of the poor and the rich. The middle will split unevenly with most upper middle class becoming rich, while the rest are modern day slaves who won’t be able to afford shit. 

TL:DR - might go all in on Tesla and GME 🤩

Hey clown. It’s his own party blocking it. If he actually wanted it he would have been demanding it this entire time. Instead he played golf every day during the negotiations then made his “demands” after the negotiations were over, and then signed the other bill. The whole thing was political theater to manipulate the very dumbest among us. And it clearly worked, because here you are, confused by the whole thing.
Has anyone, like his family, actually reported a missing person or is this speculation
This baba thing will prob be a non issue , everyone was freaking out last weekend when Baba drilled in HK on Sunday night  (after the big drop 12/24) & it ended up slightly green in our market that Monday

I've got some AMD leaps, what you guys think it'll get to by June next year / Jan of 2022?
The Jack Ma saga is a good exposition of the types of risks you take when you invest in Chinese companies - when the CCP is behind your company/management you can do no wrong and will ride into the sunset on a unicorn...but when your company/management becomes problematic in the eyes of Uncle Xi, your asshole is going to get gaped.
The market data last two weeks showed almost nobody was buying at 20 and 21 which is why it was shorted to shit on a low volume day. These OG guys got money now why cant they throw more at the top to actually force this squeeze? If not then shorts will keep profiting every time it goes up to 20 to then dip again
There is a plethora of words and charts here and for that reason I’m out.
So well written
Everyone talking about Nio beating delivery numbers for December but I just want to temper that with the fact that in November they beat and it didn't move too much. Right now seems like Nio moves on analysts raising the target price. I'm bullish but don't let yourselves get too worked up.

Transparency: I have Nio shares and 50C 1/22

Keep doing it then retard. The squeeze is coming right? If you believe why does it matter if you buy at 20 if its shooting to past 50?

For those who haven't followed Chinese c-suite news, I present to you a story that I remembered from [two years ago](https://www.wsj.com/articles/chairman-of-chinese-conglomerate-hna-dies-in-accident-1530692758) where the HNA Chairman was "sightseeing in France with some associates" when he accidentally fell off a cliff.

USD was lower 5 years ago or so too.
Yeah i was going to say.. literally just pick anything and using the most leverage possible would have delivered the 50 baggers we see here.. i mean i did great too but doesn't sound special anymore after seeing this guy.. 3K-500K for me.. i don't feel special anymore.

How much is they asshole gaping
It is. It is showing higher lows, and recently lower highs. This means there is consolidation happening; this leads to big moves. Given the long term climb I assume it will continue. This will not last forever, but it is not doing some majorly steep climb up so it has room to keep running I think.

Your flair is fitting.
These retards will never share screenshots of them averaging up and buying the top to help. They will make yall do it for them and convince you retards to diamond hand losses so they don't have to
Read number 11 and stopped. This whe syb buys weeklies or monthlies. Gtfo here with that shit 🌈
This is not the right way to look at it. You have to keep a running tally of your bankroll across the whole history since the order of events matters. Losing your ass on the first trade means you have less capital for the second trade. Having your funds tied up in a trade means you can’t make the next trade. 

It’s not enough to look at the average result from a collection of trades, you have to look at how they would perform in sequence over millions of trials

I honestly believe that with AMZN behind them that other auto makers will also look into using IVY in the future. Just as you said, Doesn’t have to be just EV. But for other manufacturers that would be able to just drop this into their platform and have it work with all other platforms is just great interface / integration across the board. Who knows maybe Apple will just buy out BB and own the new IVY program *fingers crossed*

Agreed. If 100%+ of the float bought back in it would go to 40-50 no problem even if the shorts found all the shares they needed to cover. I feel as if the squeeze has a good chance to happen on Monday. After pushing the price lower to make his EOY average look better, Melvin may give up the ghost on monday. Unless he's delusional, he may realize his thesis is dead and try to get out first.

I assumed you shorted near closing.
If anyone he has a cost average below $15 and they aren't buying at 21, youre getting pumped and fucked. Think about why the retards who claim to hold only do so bc they bought cheap. They don't buy at 21 so you retards take the losses for them. If these retards really believed in the squeeze they would be averaging up so GME would have buyers at 21 instead of what happened twice now which is the retards panic sell bc no one is buying
Fucking holidays. I’m gonna take an overdose of aderall and cheering to the futures until markets open.
no, but it is the one we deserve

I have the entire history of a strategy, win rate and expected value. 

Example: 13 years MSFT 14 dte. 5 delta short calls vs. 7 dte 5 delta short calls. 

14 days after testing 3k trades has an expected value of $1.79 on each trade 

7 days has an expected value of $1.77 on each trade 

14 days might have technically a higher EV but if I could trade 2 7DTE in the time I trade 1 14 DTE then I’d technically come out more profitable off of running 7 days.

Yesterday was my first day of actually trying out backtesting so while I’ve been around trading for a good while, using these metrics are a little different.
Honestly, if there is a small amount of proof China actually did kill Jack Ma I will sell all my China Stonks and never buy back. Not supporting that shit, I am sure other people around the world have similar morals. With this said, the hit to China stocks will be minor, but every CEO China kills the stocks lose more and more ground. I don't want to take that risk.

Should I have known China was bad before this? Yes, but I let greed blind me.

Plenty of US companies to buy. Jack Ma opened my eyes, his death will not be for nothing.
Imagine thinking you're doing your part bc you bought at $14 🤡 if youre not buying the top and holding youre nothing but a pumper getting the retards to make you rich by taking the losses themselves. Youre gonna let these retards buy at 21 so you don't have to

I appreciate the lesson you just gave me, congratulations on +800% return. Seeing those numbers are insane. 

I was wondering if you have any thoughts about PLTR and GME, besides what you said. 
I know GME is a huge YOLO, and I don't really believe most of what people are saying, however I truly believe that Ryan Cohen might turn the franchise around. 

Yes, I agree that the business seems to be dying and they are closing alot of unprofitable stores, but I also believe that to be the correct way to go about changing it from a brick and mortar ( hate that phrase) business to a e-commerce / omnichannel. If Ryan is able to create a online pet company that competes with amazone and other huge tycoons I don't really see why he couldn't turnaround Gamestop. It is already a widely known "brand" so it should be somewhat easier than creating Chewy. 
RC buying the stock at 16 $ gives me some hope.

For PLTR I don't really know what to think. It seems to be a very long play, but I feel that the involvement of Alex Karp and Peter Thiel gives it a huge market advantage. The software seems to be very sophisticated and ahead of its time, and it Will be interesting to see how the private sector utilizes it. If the BP success stories are remotely true I would think that others would at least try a demo.

Apple makes phones they don't manufacture. They own an equity stake in their manufacturer and it's one of the most automated factories for automobiles in the world. And this strategy is actually smart, you spend less building the factory early on and focus on customer care and brand building and once you gain significant traction you can build plants. But you're too low IQ.

So some of you guys saying, that SPY is always trading near ATHs. First off if SPY was 375 in January 2020 or December 2020, which one would you feel more comfortable buying in?

No actually it was morons like you that landed Galileo in jail. Denying science that is inconvenient to your agenda. Yes we get it you read the wiki article on scientific method someone linked in your anti vax what’sapp.  Now read the article I linked you to which cited several primary sources about the efficacy of masks. You citing one inconclusive meta study does not mean there is no proof. 

Here’s the difference between me and you, and why you don’t get the scientific method: I am not denying that there is inconclusive studies out there that don’t prove masks work, but you are denying studies you don’t like which suggest masks work. stop ignoring data you don’t like. This is the definition of non-science based conclusion.

Yeah, and their buyers don't have to buy TSLA's tax credits either, they can install solar panels, or do other things generate their own. The system will crumble in 2021 with the major shift to EVs. This will hurt TSLA's ability to invest in themselves, and they will keep diluting. Also note the federal tax credits that consumers got for buying an EV have expired, which is part of the reason TSLA is dropping prices. Prior to their expiration, TSLA basically rolled these credits into the price. This will hurt TSLA's margin. If you remove the tax credits, their margin has been pretty flat.

Back testing question round two for the more intelligent autist out there. 

If you guys have the data from multiple expected values on option write backtest from different days until expiration and wanted to compare optimal positions taken with number of positions executed.

Gotta keep quitting over and over. it gets easier. Know that sounds weird but average former smoker had to attempt quitting like 7-ish times or something close to that. I quit 10 years ago and it took about 8 tries.

This [study](https://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/6/6/e011045) says 30 times on average (just read the conclusions paragraph). 

Maybe get a bat that looks like a cigarette and ditch the bong. Your brain tricks easier than you think.

Try to smoke fewer and fewer cigarettes every time you come back to them. Its easy to give-up when you quit for a couple weeks and slip. If it happens, at least make sure you don't come back as heavy a smoker as you were before. So remember its going to take some tries so you don't have to hate-smoke yourself to death because you gave up after a good 9 day run.

You want your cigarettes smoked chart to look bearish; lower highs and lower lows. But it doesn't have to crash overnight for you to be successful. So don't sell your puts because it went back up one day.

Focus on stuff that gets better after you quit. A week in, you'll be able to smell and taste stuff better. Couple weeks and cilia in your bronchial tubes are starting to turn back on. Run and test-out your refurbished lungs. Get some good food you haven't had in awhile, that shit will taste better, no bullshit. Plus you'll have the $ for it because you won't be spending it on smokes.

Then one time when you quit, you'll cave and smoke one and it'll taste like shit. You'll wonder why the fuck you need this in your life. You won't finish the cigarette because it gross. That won't be your last one ever. But that's the final bear flag. Cigs are going tits up and it'll happen soon.

Godspeed autist. You got this.

Since we're talking about China so much I have a related story. The university I went to had a alot of Chinese students. There were several Chinese restaurants near campus. I worked with a couple Chinese girls (really cute btw) at a campus job. One of them told me I should go to one of the restaurants and order this item, sorry I honestly forget what it was, which was apparently on the Chinese menu, but not the English one. I go there, order that, the waitress had such a funny look on her face. "You like Chinese food???" "Yeah I'll give it a shot." It was actually pretty good. 

Also cheating among the Chinese students was rampant. Chinese TAs sent all the Chinese students answers to exams ahead of time, answers to homework assignments. They also walked SLOW AS FUCK and walked 4 people wide taking up the whole sidewalk. One Chinese guy I knew never cut his fingernails.

Bury a loved one who passed mid 60s due to lung cancer.  Decide that you do not want that fate for yourself.  From that point forward at every urge just remind yourself that you cannot have even a single smoke/vape.  Your body will clear nicotine in 3 days, within 10 days you'll have broken a lot of habits and things get easier and the self reminders get farther apart.  Good luck.
That’s true. No real opposition means one way street and Wall Street doesn’t necessarily like that. But I see Joey B as republican lite really. I don’t see why big corporate favoritism would end, at least short term. If it were Bernie, that would make a significant difference.

No that is not how it works. At your step "sell everything" that is when you owe taxes in the US; either short-term or long-term capital gains taxes. When you sell an equity is when you are taxed. It doesn't matter what you do afterward. Your gains for the year are offset by any losses for the tax year. You only pay taxes on gains.

As long as the recovery story stays intact, the stock will march towards the October highs. I loved what the company is doing so far: divesting the excess and focusing on improving core businesses. Right now they're financially engineering EPS growth for future quarters via buybacks so I'd expect the stock to go up, all else equal. Company clearly won't go bankrupt as they have a net cash position now (iirc) so shorting doesn't make sense unless one believes it's criminally overvalued (it's not) or poorly run (it's not).

Ultimately, leadership still has to execute the turnaround operationally which will take some time, and we don't know how much covid contributed to BBBY sales. If they can maintain/steal market share while streamlining costs and improving the customer's online experience, I don't see how the stock doesn't go up.

That said, I think this is more of a long term play. I think they'll do fine this quarter but that doesn't mean shorts have to cover — and just because there is high short interest doesn't mean the stock has to squeeze. I've got 100 shares I picked up last week (and a Feb 20/25 call debit) and will add a bit more on dips post-ER if the story stays intact.

I’m sayin
He is out of the public eye and he was removed from the show because the cccp is removing him as a cultural icon and he knows it the state media has already started the re-education campaign average Chinese now vilify him instead of glorifying him so no TV show is going to feature him he's being recast as a cultural villain and how not to act and he will be made an example of to all Chinese.

I think the NIO EC6 is roughly $52,000 USD compared to the Model Y $68,000 USD in China. Maybe the Made in China Model Y will drive down prices, but we'll see what NIO does about pricing.

Mr. Wolf? That's all you had to say!
This is false. Must be non-dependent for the credit. No exceptions

“Generally, you are eligible to claim the Recovery Rebate Credit, if you were a U.S. citizen or U.S. resident alien in 2020, are not a dependent of another taxpayer for tax year 2020, and have a social security number valid for employment that is issued before the due date of your 2020 tax return (including extensions).” From your link

True
But here's the thing... the way science works is it's on the person making the assertion to prove it's true.  So, it's on mask advocates to prove they work.  I might as well tell you to wear red socks to stop viral spread.  You say that doesn't do anything and I ask you for a source?  No. That's not how it works.  It's on people who say wear masks to prove they're effective.  Turns out, this has been heavily studied and widely show that they don't work.
Haha asking for real? The best anyone can hope for is $30 by end of month because of earnings run up and they're having a demo day
Just trying to compare to how overvalued big caps got in the 1999 bubble
I think a lot of the selling on the 31st was tax losses from everyone who bought in the high 20s. They’ll buy back in this week since it’s sitting at the decent price. Back to 28$ soon. But getting into the 30s again is another story.

Okay, I buy that argument on trade ins. The only issue is it will take a long time before they see an ROI on trade ins. Like if they pay MSFT $450 per series x (just guessing), and discount the trade in by $150, sell for $500, they lose $150 per console of which a lot of digital would need to be sold to cover that (assuming they don’t resell the Xbox one). This will be good in long term I agree. But Wall Street is very biased towards short term earnings

In this sub the dailymail is considered “news”. Some tabloid sayings Jack Ma has not been seen for two months blah blah
Actually you absolutely compare companies who are in the same area so comparing Tesla and neo makes sense do you compare stock prices no that's retarded and not at all what I said I was comparing revenue and snow and tier arbor tech companies but no you don't just compare companies because they're tech you go another level deeper and they're both software as a service and then you look at things like what are their revenues what are the revenue growths and what are their margins and then you look at their valuations.  who the fuck said look at stock prices and compare companies base solely on stock price that's as idiotic and basic as it gets and you projecting that on to me is a complete fucking insult so go fuck yourself

Hey no simping in this subreddit
wasn't expecting this random Metallica lyric, but nice!
How does stock trading work in the US? Do you immediately owe taxes in every trade you make? Because I'm in Norway, and I have a separate stock account that I can use for trading, and there is 0 tax as long as I don't take out more from there, than I've put in. Eg.:

I put in $100 to the stock account. Taxes owed: 0.  
I buy PLTR for $100. Taxes owed: 0.  
PLTR goes up to $200. Taxes owed: 0.  
I sell everything. I now have $200 in my stock account. Taxes owed: 0.  
I transfer $100 out of my stock account to my regular checking account. Taxes owed: 0.  
I transfer another $100 out of my stock account. Now I owe 100*0.23 = 23$ as tax this year.  

Is this not how it works in the US?

Yes all those things do matter. We’ve had dysfunctional government since 1990. We don’t even pass budgets anymore, we just have continuing resolutions. It’s so weird to me that your argument is if the two republicans seats go to republicans, that everything staying the exact same means a crash. Good luck with your trading.

I am too lazy to look at your comment history considering that’s an idiotic way to post references like this. Link me to a study that affirmatively refutes masks as not working at all. Most I’ve seen is inconclusive which supports mask wearing because the consensus it they don’t hurt anything and it’s better to be safe in the absence of conclusive research.
CCP is already balls deep in NIO, if there is an issue it won’t be them targeting. 60+ eow

If I get rich before the global conflict gets intense enough I might be able to save a lot of the brainwashees by overriding their toxic brainwashing with more useful brainwashing to get them to breed themselves out of existence with no bloodshed. I have the honesty gene and extreme amounts of intelligence so my charisma scales almost directly to how much power I have. Once I get powerful enough for it to start making people like things I say instead of my powerlessness making people hate things I say, I can find out how many of the brainwashed people are really toxic deep down vs how many have potential to get better. Unfortunately I assume most of them are just really toxic deep down and they won't let me override their existing brainwashing because they'd really just rather make me kill them than let me make them give up their delusions and luxuries and conveniences and such in the name of life and liberty. It'll just be nice if I get the chance to save the ones I can by getting rich and powerful before the conflict instead of only having a chance to get powerful during the conflict with blood instead of dollars.

Does it really matter if Jack Ma "disappeared"? In all honesty I'd probably be willing to invest more knowing that he has zero sway in the company...

So you read one study that studied 100 studies? Lol. Yeah that’s the same one I looked at originally. Not to continue to rag on you but meta studies are only so useful, and they’re not useful at all when statistically insignificant. There’s just way too many variables between studies and time periods and stuff. 

Plenty of other research cited in this article to get a view of both sides. I don’t think masks are some great cure but I do think they help. Even if it’s just with reducing viral load.

Climate change isn’t causing the entire globe to heat up, some places get colder some get warmer. The poles are heating up which is why The ice is melting and sea levels rising/ ocean acidifying. 

Other parts of the world will experience more severe swings between seasons and changes to normal weather and climate patterns. 

WSB doesn’t care tho so bring on the downvotes you oil guzzling cucks
Hopefully they will learn, I for one, am getting god damn bored of seeing nothing but flooded posts of PLTR and GME. It’s been months for christ sakes... shit is not happening. Get to posting some good gains and losses.

It's not a needle in a haystack, it's the entire body of scientific research prior to 2020 when everything got political and retarded confirms it.

Did sciencentific research on viral transmission change in the past 6 months?  No.  It did not.  But, mass hysteria sure did.

I don’t understand where tf this PLTR perception of their talent came from. They are nowhere near FAANG/Microsoft or Airbnb type unicorn talent. Maybe capital one.

I still think they’re a solid bet but their future is maybe the next oracle. This isn’t a commentary on their share value price but everyone who thinks they are the most desirable company is wrong. They’re a stepping stone to the next level and can’t hold any talent.

They also signed up Lincoln. How did the market react?

I am specifically talking about how cars are manufactured. Not some in-cabin tech. Or even driving assist. 

More specifically, changing cars so they are moving connected nodes (quoting Herbert Diess here). Sensors are built into the car from day 1. The data is used to exponentially improve the quality of the product, lower cost and introduce new features. Catching up is difficult because the market leader will always move faster due the sheer amount of data. 

That’s the new way things are manufactured. Industry 4.0.

I know the difference, but I don't see why masks would act differenrly on droplets carrying viruses vs bacteria.
You didn’t even read your own study lol. They concluded that it was inconclusive but in theory cloth face masks should work to some extent, and N95 masks work. Scientifically illiterate is saying that because they found no correlation in that study but concluded that it was inconclusive that that means masks don’t work.

Hey do you ever consider holding onto a car for a bit longer than 3-4 years? That seems like too much car buying to me.
Honestly. After this past year I been trading with a tin foil hat on. Nothing makes sense in this market. But the only thing that’s been moving is future ideologies and the potential of the past we all know of returning. 

Currently. We have no clue if 1. The past luxuries of going everywhere care free will EVER be back in place unti they revamp the world system of travel 2. How advanced these tech companies truly are. 

This pandemic allows tech companies to research and thrive more, while allowing the rest of the world to crumble due to there limited resources. 

Considering Canada pension plan along with many other institutions invested into PLTR I think they are just allowing for a sideways trade for a while until the next big volume up. 

Once the vaccines are distributed worldwide, they gotta hand in it, after distribution, they’ll have a hand in contact tracing. 

Tesla is 700 dollars..... after split ?!?! That’s nuts. Not even a year ago it was 400-50” bucks ..... pre split, this is wild

I think more stocks are gonna continue the trajectory of uncommon rise like Tesla. All due to future growth, and people that truly know tech, and truly know Tesla’s, apples and palantir plans know the future value of these companies. 

I have been saying. Appl msft Amazon Google are the monopolies in the tech world, and there’s not much we can do about it, I’m so bullish on these companies that they are going to have an even stronger pull within governments in the future due to how essential there resources are for government bodies.
You're clearly in the scientifically illiterate category.
I'm not going to explain the difference b/w bacteria and viruses.  You're clearly in the scientifically illiterate category.

What is your definition of a “hit piece”? Are you disputing the veracity of the reports which have appeared across multiple news outlets?  “Hit piece” usually translates to: “a truth which I find very inconvenient.”
Ah, I see you’re a man of PLTR as well.
Yeah their number is fake but if you really think they have a worse number than US then Idk what to tell you.
I think it means that from a moral perspective most of us aren't really all that thrilled about what PLTR does (big brother), but it is (was) printing tendies so everybody was willing to look the other way and go balls deep. To a lesser extent oil and companies like LMT who profit on war.

If there’s a lot of trades and especially options, there’s a good chance that turbotax doesn’t get it right. 

Plus there’s a bunch of obscure rules that can impact cost bases along with the deductibility of certain losses. 

For most people this is probably not a huge concern. However, there definitely becomes a point where it would be best to see an accountant. Especially due to the possibility of the IRS or equivalent in other countries getting involved. Once they notice you’re not doing shit right one year, they just keep coming back.

“I know poor people are getting fucked harder than before, but at least fewer of them are!” 

Also

“Hey, at least it’s better than it was in the 1800s!”

That’s what you sound like.
See my comment history for several studies saying exactly that.  Masks have been heavily studied for viral transmission prior to 2020 when it became political.  It's overwhelmingly conclusive that they do nothing.
The stock price traded in the hedge fund sweet spot to render a bunch of calls and puts worthless by Dec 31st.

If these guys bought shares, the options skulduggery by Hedge Funds would mellow out a lot. Weeklies? you guys won a ton on the way up to $20 but now at FV ($27 Market before earnings, I believe its more like $35) your not smart enough to beat algorithms at these levels.
Are you kidding? Jack Ma news is bad for all Chinese stocks. And I own NIO
Accurate
Where you at Ma!!
Interesting. I stand corrected. Thanks.

No. They do not.  This has been widely shown in previous scientific research.
🤔 interesting conclusion, considering none of the studies say that. They can severely limit viral spread however.

Masks social distancing wearing glasses washing and disinfecting - all lower the chances you get it. They don’t eliminate it. Question of practices bro. Eating bacon and red meat daily and not exercising doesn’t mean you’ll have a heart attack but it sure raises the likelihood you have a coronary.

This is exactly what is wrong with it. If your investment account values are below a certain amount, you should not be subject to as high penalties. Also, the day trade limit for under 25K accounts just seems designed to keep poor people poor.
Can yall leave this man be?
yeah I know the TPP was a damn shame to be torn down, but I think keeping tariffs is simply symbolic of keeping a discernable front against china in the least and I think at most it gives rise to hesitation from other countries to do business with china if they wanted to stay in the good graces of the US. There are definitely more affects from them than China would ever show to the world. They're dependent on extracting our wealth. But, in terms of tariffs it's the beginning to how we need to have some fundamental stance that US politicians will be united in fighting against Chinese overreach and the weakening of America. If it has to start with tariffs, so be it, from there we need to build out more aggressive and comprehensive economic policy to play hardball with China. I don't want to just keep China in check, I want to crush it. It is a threat through and through to American life and hegemony, we shouldn't be doing anything else but playing the next cold war with China and Russia in our sights.

If you think masks work to stop viral spread, you might be scientifically illiterate.
i mean in a logical sense, if you're already in a position, it's in your best interest to bring others to it to drive it's value up... but on another note, who are u?
Well one example which is similar (different from OPs put spread strategy in that it uses calls but the outcome is the same) would be this TSLA credit spread. http://opcalc.com/k74 1/08 800/795. Pays out 7% if TSLA ends the week below 795 (it will). That becomes a 5% return if you move to the 840/830 1/08. Or similarly you could choose a deep ITM debit spread for the same week at 600/650, http://opcalc.com/k75 which provides an 8.75% return if TSLA finishes the week above 650, and gives 50 points of insurance. 

TSLA isn't the only candidate, but these are examples of safe 5-10% weekly returns, taking advantage of lotto-call buyers.

But to them they are the “boss” and they don’t realize how small of a pond they are a big fish in. I told them I make in a day what they make in a week and just quit. Not used to how I work. Lazy and incompetent. But it could have just been the bubble I was in as well. I doubt a company that size is congested with retards

Timing this stuff is a bitch - but 80% lockup expiration is huge. Those insider shares have a basis of <$10, so a partial sell off to realize gains will be inevitable. 

I own shares with covered calls that had to be rolled because I got caught on the upswing. Not planning to buy them back until lockup expires because I’m expecting a solid decline to the mid teens, then a gradual reversal back up into April as the patient institutions build their positions.

Most EVs just develop their own (Tesla, VW, etc).

That's what I did last week. I just couldn't find anything I wanted to buy. We are in need of a really nice dip, a lot of people on the sidelines waiting to buy. If the dow can fall to 29k and SPY to 355, dip buyers would propel us to dow 32k and spy 400.

Gotta go down and charge before we can blast off.

Nope, he sold his entire position as of 13F filed 2020-09-30.
OP is bearish on a company that will take on the world, posts a graph that was clearly manipulated for several reasons during choppy December and in the face of the historic January rally, he's bearish lol.
Without the crash there would have been no brrrrr
Nio isn't apple. I mean it's about to be by creating its own ecosystem but nio is just beginning.
That weeeknd Dow tho
I have shares. 80 shares. Just wanted a nice small profit off of paper hands when it dipped Dec 30. I was up $900 but fucking held the call until Dec 31 and got annihilated. Bought Dec 31 24 Calls to try to stop the bleeding and it made it worse.
Truth
Look at the amount of awards this thread has! That's clear sign people are well off and why you shouldn't be bearish

With options it’s different. I bought a 30 call on PLTR right as it was about to hit 30 that same day. I shit you not was down 10k on my investment lol and it only dropped to like 25 bucks.
Nah he's getting waterboarded by pooh bear so he will admit a crime he didn't committ

Not big on confirmation bias, as it can be an echo chamber, but it's make me feel a little better knowing you stated that. I don't have classical TA understanding and went in pretty huge at 251 shares to my account.

TY for the analysis. Keep them coming when you have time.
😁😁😁
Don’t feel bad. I bought 1/15 $50c on the 28th when Nio was trading at $44. Got scared with the baba news and sold then next day for a 5% loss.
He’s done a solid job. If he wants a chance to do more he should convey competency and a strategic vision.

Nah ill ha e to give them a listen tho thx dude
nah man, be careful, such numbers were already known by big MMs, so it is already in the price - after spike they gonna fix their profits = dip, so need to wait...

You own $3k of PLTR and you’re telling people to get in or gtfo? $3k is shit. Tell us when you have $300k in.
You know how there’s the time when you’re super high and then for some reason you take another hit and then you blast off into a level of being high that you didn’t even know was possible and it’s great but you’re also concerned that you may have broken something in your brain? That’s what this market feels like right now.

My uncle is the captain of the ccp and he said that the Chinese love the US and they only want to make the world a better place. Also told me Nio will be buying out Tsla by 2023 and will be valued at $8,000 per share after a 4-1 split. He didn’t die yet but since he’s so popular he started a guest list now. So far he has 12000 rsvp. Remember this when you decide to pass up on Chinese stocks US bros

I believe it was far more to do with the latter. Obviously the sparrow plays a more positive role in the maintenance of the ecosystem than what it takes away when it eats crops. This led to greater starvation due to crop failures as a effect due to locust plagues. Its no secret that Xi wants to pivot back to Maoism, so it should be taken into account in a modern context

Haha it’s all good man. It’s confusing, sorry if I come off a little harsh, wouldn’t be the first time I’ve been told that... gotta work on that shit, esp cuz old shit about Canadian politics except that your leader is called the Prime Minister and our definitions of veto are the exact opposite lol

Bills have to pass both the House AND Senate to pass along to the President for a signature. In regards to MJ bills, since the House has been blue (Democratic majority) and Pelosi as majority leader supports reform and therefor allows bills to hit the floor and get a vote. This is where MJ bills shine, in the House of Representatives. However that’s as far as they get because the Senate is Red (Republican Majority) and Mitch McConnell doesn’t support reform. Therefor bills get blocked and aren’t even allowed to hit the floor for a vote! Which is totally ridiculous that one man decides the fate of the bill, but that’s the way it works. MJ bills have been fine when it comes to a vote in the House but none get a chance to receive a signature from the president because they all die in the Senate because of one man and one man only, Mitch McConnell. That’s why this election on Tuesday is so important for the industry. If Dems win both seats Kamala will cast the tie breaking vote and Schumer should become majority leader and he supports reform. Bills will then be allowed to at least get a vote and most likely a few will pass and get sent to Biden for a signature, where he will have the final say.
was it a wet dream?
Everything in me told me not too. I wanted Nio calls  originally. I went with quantity over quality since pltr calls were cheaper.
Bundles nobody wanted, but boght nevertheless. Had they bundled it with 5 lbs of horseshit fot 20% higher price, those packages would have been sold just as fast

Good job man, I've only been trading for about 2 years now and I don't trust the market at all.  It's like everyone's playing a game of financial chicken.  I'm up about 35% for 2020 (it'd be about 150% if I hadn't missed out on like 70k because I sold covered calls on ZS and PTON that got exercised) but I'm 32 now and I really hope I can retire by 40.  I'm making about 80k/year and living very comfortably but I think I'm just kind of mentally checked out of my job now.

Paying $2.10 for a $20 strike that 40% OTM and 8 months to expiry doesn’t seem that galaxy-brained.

Hoping for a pullback but as I said not sure it will happen with the steel prices as they are. There is massive OI call volume at $30. Its going to struggle to get through that unless the market makers detect lots of buying activity they are then going to need to buy the stock to hedge themselves and you could see the stock explode through that point.

tbh never heard of it happening. From previous experience I learned never to buy a stock based on acquisition theories but this will just be a very small lotto play.

No different that Chipotle/E-Coli outbreak scandal inducing completely predictable teardown/build-up SP cycle.

China took over Hong Kong, ruining the special financial rules they had that allowed them access to the world markets. Not sure why you think they give a shit about BABA's stock.
No luck!!! You have to do fundamental research. I learned about the companies I bought by reading SEC filings and making phone calls before I bought anything!

Yall PLTR whinning girls losing money on stupid calls..... stfu!!! You all were late!!! While it was booming you jumped in late, bought calls you thought were going to pay and many are now down. This is a long hold stock. I get it you want quick profit but damn. I bought this at $9 and change knowing it was a no brainer hold for several years. I am not selling a single share till years down the road. Understand when you should of bought. You want a tip of what calls to buy...... BUY LEAPS!!! An easy for sure win!!! Thank me later.

The argument is that if you burn more oil making an EV car battery than a normal car burns in its life time then the EV didn’t really have a net positive impact. Which used to be the case. Ten years ago the greenest vehicle on the planet was not an EV, it was a Ford F-150, because the manufacturing process was simple. Typically the manufacturing process is more harmful to the environment than the driving part. Let’s be honest, there’s not a strong argument that a a “gigafactory” is great for the environment. I’m not sure how much improvements have been made now days, it’s been a long time since I did any research, but that used to be the crux of the “EV is not green” argument.
I think I’d definitely choose Florida over Texas tho. You can’t drive your yacht up to your crib in DFW.

You can't buy them once they go up. There are some momentum trades available but you have to do proper fundamental research (not the autistic DD on this sub that only looks at one side of things). Really dig in and see if you love the management and make absolutely certain you're not overpaying for the security. Always get stuff at a discount. Never FOMO.
BABA boys have been on a roller coaster. ANT IPO cancelled -12%, CCP investigation another -12%, finally a +7% reversal, immediate shit talking to people who didn’t buy the obvious dip, then Jack Ma vanishes during a Talent show. Baba is a weekly affair.
Will NIO IV rise tomorrow?
I think the solution is to stop financially incentivizing single mothers based on number of children.

Some couples stay unmarried to maximize their subsidy.

Something is wrong when the poorest are having more children than the middle class.

Lmao credit spreads on a high IV ticker. Absolutely not full of shit, you just need to choose meme stocks. AAPL isn't going to get you there- TSLA/PLTR/GME/Selective ER trades will absolutely get you a relatively safe and consistent 8% return. Do your research.

Yeah fair enough but take it for what it is. We were just talking about the news earlier over fb and he said that. Before ya ask no I'm not a shorter I hold stocks on revolut ahaha I wouldn't even know how to short. Hope it moons for baba owners tho.

That's it. That's the move.

But your dik is probably a mile long so I don’t want to hear any complaining
If I were you I'd drop it all into some high yield closed end funds, should give you over 200k per year to never lift a finger again.
Jack isn’t even dead
I hate that they are rebooting it instead of literally thawing the characters out and restarting the school in 2021.  No cliff-hanger ending ever provided a more plausible setup for a return from a decades-long hiatus.

High premium tickers TSLA, NVDA, ZM, PTON, SNOW. High IV and Decent price per share is what I like.

Entry point for PLTR is through my anal cavity lads 🍩 Have at it 👌😎👌
I thought so too. Was looking into selling ATM puts of AAPL for 2/3k each week starting tomorrow. If I get assigned, so be it, I sell CC’s that week. 

Just wondering if this would be more work than just buying the shares outright and then constantly selling CC’s at 10% OTM each week.
I don’t know if you know this but the internet allows you to shop online. It’s wild I know.

What are your predictions for price target in the next 3-6 months for GME?
5-10% return per week? You're risking too much bro. As soon as you go over 5% return, your chances of fucking up are much higher. I've been there multiple times. I keep a spreadsheet and I've found that 1-3% are much more consistent winners over time
In this age, why does the market even closer on weekends? Pretty insane.

Your problem is that you’re so busy defending democrats that you assume anyone who doesn’t bow to them is republican. Fuck them too. I don’t want a hand out from either. And I definitely don’t need them telling me how to build something.

I had every intention of buying an RDX yesterday. Went into the local dealer and said I can only find one RDX on the west coast with the color and interior color I want but it’s all the way in Oakland and I’d rather give my business to a local dealer. They could have had an easy sale but they came back and quoted me $57,000 like I’m a fucking retard. I pointed out that their base price before accessories was $6k more than the exact same car in Oakland. On top of that they were marking up all the accessories like sleezeballs. Gonna charge me $800 to install the upgraded wheels and $600 to put on the black chrome emblems. They even had a $44 installation for the fucking floor mats. I just crunched the numbers in front of the guy and then left. I’m not doing business with people like that.

I liked the Q5 more than the RDX from the start. We were going with the RDX because it has more cargo room and we thought it was going to be $10k cheaper.  The salesman at Audi was super transparent and gave us a kick ass deal up front. He got his 5% and I didn’t have to haggle for hours.

Hard agree that it could go either way.

Might buy exactly one ATM weekly just for the hell of it?
Yes, those are word.
Yeah like 2-4 console per store on release date. Walmart for example on the other hand had like 20+ per store. Then there's target, best buy, meijer, Costco and a whole bunch of other online retailers that did like 4-5 additional drops over the holiday season. GameStop did only 1 additional drop and it was again like 2-4 consoles per store again. Yeah bundles were eventually sold out, but also returned. But anyway point is, GameStop is absolute shit of a retail store (currently). Which we already know and don't need to convince ourselves otherwise. Let's just hope the earnings expectations are so low they will be beat and the stock will moon on retard strength anyway 🚀🚀

Noob here so maybe I'm looking at this wrong but isn't what PLTR is doing with all the constant up and down and so much interest in the stock just perfect for selling covered calls? (Buy a long dated call for a bit of insurance on a down day, sell covered calls on an up day, rinse and repeat). I hope it goes on like this for a while.

Lol they barely do.  Big 3 will crash 100 plus cars, more for higher volume programs.  They do the bare minimum testing for any of their stuff- look at their control arms or their approach to “testing” FSD.
i think they only get a cut if they are the ones who sold the thing, which they aren't doing a lot of.  a cut of microtransactions yikes i guess those nano-profits better add up quick
No wonder I got a boner when I saw Sid from the ice age
Ok we’re not talking about a bill though, we’re talking about a flip in the senate. As long as Republicans keep the senate, Mitch is the majority leader. And as long as Mitch is majority leader, marijuana bills will not hit the senate floor. He has stated several times that he does not support the legalization of marijuana. The reason marijuana reform bills hit and pass on the floor of the house is because it’s blue and pelosi supports reform. The senate turning blue would be monumental. For marijuana, it didn’t matter if Biden or Trump became president; what mattered is a blue congress; not red and not purple.
You had me at "I don't know."

They are currently trying to disrupt the healthcare industry. That’s huge. Whatever division that is will likely become the most valuable company on earth all by itself.

No he wouldn't. He would get to offset his entire 500k and would pay gains on 100k. Read the rules you dummy.
Realistically with like 120—200k, you can get like around 10k a week just by doing put credit spreads far OTM. The only issue is getting to that amt of money first

Edit: example trade NVDA 490/480p 1/8 x150. Spreads net $61 each, and requires $1k collateral each. $150k of em = 150 spreads  for $9k credit. Weeklies at these  OTM strikes  have enough volume too

They only liquidate if you are poor and trade on margin. Otherwise you can just bend over and take you anal fucking like a good little sissy and become a bag holder for life.
Putting aside NuScale I belive they still have alot of room for growth in their Mining & industrial buisness. Also the turn around alone can make the stock double from current levels. even with the problems I belive that should be achievable.
Love you
Get in now. Nio is going to continue to grow. I got in at $5 and then sold at $5 only to realize my mistake and get back in at $30. In a couple years people will be saying they wish they got in at $40, $50, $60 etc.

That depends on when it was acquired. But in theory yes. I used student loan debt that I refinanced during the marriage as a bargaining chip. Since the law is the law they tried to say it was “all before the marriage” but to shuffle assets and bring more funds into the marriage it had to be done. It also depends on what she’s trying to go after as to how dirty you have to play. Also... fuck child support.
It seems with TSLA earnings, it can be a sell the news deal, but usually with the vehicle numbers, if they are good stock goes up. Already went up about 6% in anticipation, so guess about another 10% Monday.

Pump has happened, if you’re buying now you’re holding longer term for some Paysafe earnings or announcements.

Yall really don't get it, GME will get a cut of every Fortnight skin, Rocket League goal explosion, Xbox live or gamepass renewal..

They've already expanded into the best games marketplace outside of Steam and are the only ones getting cuts of Microtransactions. 

M$ manages all of this, it's low effort maximum reward. Gamestops are about to be the new Microsoft stores. 

The Elder Scrolls 6 is a M$ exclusive.. really missing the picture here but keep being 10 years late to every play.
Hahahahaha! 😂😂😂 

“That’s the murder house!”
How? How have you been losing on this POS stock? It seriously keeps rising.
That's the whole point.  sheesh. smoothbrains.
So a serious question...
I own jan8 47 calls.  I typically do not hold my calls this close to expiry but i had intended to buy the rumor with NIO day approaching and see if i can get a bump this week... but i was not expecting this type of catalyst.

Looks like there may be a bump tomorrow with this news... ques is when do i sell?  Tomorrow when i think its topping or should i wait to Tue or Wed?  Theta will be on the clock all week.  
You you think vega will build throughout the week with this news and 9jan approaching just as it does as earnings day approaches?  I guess the trick is to find the balance between theta and vega?  
If i start getting too fancy the bukkake will miss its target.
Tks for any input.

Haha jump horsey go brrrr
I would agree the scenario that Dems sweep the GA, but strongly disagree with Republican holding one seat, which only means that nothing in Congress will be completed given all the political fiasco that Republicans are attempting to accept the democratic election results. GA counted 3 times, 2 of which are hand counts, and they still keep saying some frauds without providing any credible evidences. 

Republican holding one seat in Senate only means that market crash is coming sooner or later when they are attempting to chastitize FED (Remember when PA Senator trying to limit FED before this stimulus?) Perhaps, if that occurs, it's wise to move to safer stocks with high dividends. 

As we are witnessing now that Republican Senators are challenging the election results, they are leaning toward uncertainty, which is the last thing the capitalists like to see. No body wants to invest money to a country, where some lawmakers can deny the election results, and America isn't exceptional in this case. It's fair to say Republican members love this kind of uncertainty, let alone the current President. Probably because Republicans have really nothing to lose in political capital anyway.

I have a feeling that house vote was more so to gain voters in Georgia and turn the state blue, not to actually decriminalize weed.  Politicians, blue or red, are politicians.  If they haven't cared about the billions in tax revenue, they wont all of the sudden.  They want to ensure their lobbyist are getting there's, otherwise whats the point, politician wont be in office next election cycle.  

Don't get me wrong, im long in APHA, and until recently had positions in TLRY.  I still hold many weed stocks, and have many positions waiting to be filled next week.  I do believe within the next four years weed will be decriminalized and subsequently legalized, however, I don't think this particular bill is the catalyst that will send us over the hump.

That’s not even remotely true. It’s called an end game and it happens at the highest levels.
Extra caution is warranted when it comes to Chinese companies; they simply don’t have the same transparency laws and disclosure regulations you find in other markets (like the US). Hell, the CCP routinely lies about even *independently verifiable* figures like national GDP.

Why the fuck would it be seized by ICE
That's right, it's not about fee collection. It's to keep you and other people safe on your property. Building codes are the collective wisdom of building professionals on how to build safe structures. They're not written by politicians intent on infringing on your personal liberties as you moronically seem to think. And of course, to you, it's all those damn Dems, because you're too uninformed to understand that politicians don't have anything to do with writing building code. And it's enforced locally, by both Rs and Ds.

But by all means, build something that's not up to code. When some kid comes over to visit and kills himself on your not up to code structure, you're going to get sued for all you're worth and your insurance company is going to refuse to pay.  This shit happens all the time. And the dopes like you who are always crying about government are the first in line asking for handouts when your own stupidity gets you in trouble.

That's because you're not the one trying to mind your own business, as terrorists attack you and your family for not being in their same religion.

The CCP being reactive before clearly didn't work; that's why so many of these happened in the first place.  Notice the reportings of these attacks slow down or stop after 2014 or so.

So what the hell would you propose if 20+ Ft. Hood shootings/Boston Marathon bombings/Pulse nightclub shootings happened on your soil?  Just let more innocent people be stabbed, shot, and bombed?
Why would this be the year?
January is the most depressing month of the year according to studies. We should start seeing swarms of evictions this month. Bullish if you ask me.

No beef with doctors particularly. They think they are smarter than they actually are in reality which makes them think they can understand the group dynamics of the markets and they're often wrong. But they're a great source of income for me. Also they don't realize how easy they are to manipulate. Same with engineers if that helps.

Answer my retarded question to help other retards:

If I bought 100 shares with some margin, let’s say, 70 shares my own money and 30 with some margin, will I still be able to write options on those shares?
Last year I realized if I had just bought and held I would have made like $100,000. Buy and hold is so boring. But it works.

Yeah, I try to manage the money like a hedge fund manager (but as an amateur with limited funds and tools). As the market hits new highs and entering over-bought territory I start to sell stuff that is getting frothy, then as the market keeps going higher I start buying puts while still holding onto my long-term longs. Never use margin unless the market is at the bottom of its upward channel, and when I do it is only 15% of total portfolio. No YOLO’s for me, I had that kind of fun in my 20’s - now I need to hold onto to this money to grow and get out of the Rat Race.

As a note to OP lump sum projects are not billed at the end of projects. You submit progress invoices based on percentage complete against the lump sum price over the duration of the project.   5-10% would be held as retainage until project completion.
Flush twice after shitting and flush once after pissing. Works 100% of the time. Worse possible case, after flushing lift the lid to check. It's not that difficult
Yeah it’s gonna be a while to rise but nows the time to get in. Moore’s law is dead. AMD while a better chip maker right now isn’t going to suddenly jump in tech level. Intel at least as something they can fix and match AMD once they get their head out of their asses.

Honestly those points are weak analysis and justification for you to be holding puts. I can't believe you would put your money down based on those points. A 12 year old could come up with a better thesis to buy puts.

Don't go short on a stock making 52wk highs. You're fighting a strong technical trend here and GME has all the tailwinds to keep the price rising for the next little while. Good luck.

Short term Palantir outlook? Do you think there will be another run to $30 before lockup ends? Just don’t know what caused such a massive selloff last week. Every day was pretty painful.

Yes I know they have issues but the stock was at a point where I feel it couldn’t go lower. That’s the only reason I bought not because they’re better then AMD and figured out their shit but just because it’s the right time.

You should learn the ticker for Apple, and leave the counting to people that aren't retarded.
All institutions are greedy fxxxxks. So when a stock goes in a a single day 20percent up for no good reason, they will certainly not pass off on the squeeze opportunity to help a fellow hedge fund and settle for 10 percent above market. This stock will fly to the moon as the FED can print money, but no GME shares and it comes all back to supply and demand. Here the demand ( shares short) is much higher than supply ( shares outstanding). In conclusion 🚀🚀🚀🛸🛸🛸🛸🛸🚀🚀
Red or green tomorrow guys. What do you think?

Holy crap, the awards this thread has is insane.
NIO gonna be parobolic
Bill Ackman and Herbalife might be an example. It's literally an MLM, but because it's cult of morons Ackman's efforts of showing it is an actual scam fell flat and he ended up closing his position with a loss. Sounds awfully like what's happening with GME here.

Well it didn’t, anyway I’m no paper hand so I’m holding my a$$ at 27.00
I think you can do it that way yes. But I wasn’t going to get one without the financing so I made sure I had that in place first. This is why I said that their sales is great. I called, asked for the financing, and that same day they had sent the paperwork to my bank for their approval. After it was approved, I went ahead and made the reservation.

I would suggest to just call your local Tesla and ask them about their financing. As I said, I think this was an end of year thing. It could have also been only for the Norwegian market.
I like it now when companies moon the whole month before reports and then go back a bit after lol

If they could produce enough of the product for distributors to sell at retail and not premium they would be on track.

Supply constraints introduce secondary and tertiary headwinds in addition the the primary issue of just not being able to meet demand.

Still, a bit of a gold plated problem. I expect both AMD and NVDA to take off again post-CES. Right behind MU and TSMC, which are already beginning to pop off.

It was not uncommon to see a guy lose 3-4k in a couple of hours. 

These guys all made six figures tax free but the way they treated it was retarded. 

Even the janitors made six figures because they had to hold a clearance to work in the embassy.

Yep the NKLA $50 was a situationally thing where if investors didn’t sell it could easily have happened. I said it was highly unlikely. AAPL will explode, love how you ignore my MGNI calls and others. Do what you want.. this isn’t a call but rather from charts and I’m telling you it’s coming.

Say hi to Joe.
I read somewhere that institutional buyers will look to get in at around $20. Cant remember what was the analysis behind it, but im retarded so there's that. 

I wonder if it does go down to 20, will we see some slow bleed out until the lock-up expiry, and then a buy-up from the big boys, or if it goes below 20 it'll automatically trigger a buy-up
Anyone also a proponent of one-SPAC-at-a-time trading? I feel that it's not your duty to catch them all, but rather to pick one with a high level of conviction and wait how it plays out... then reinvest your earnings into a new opportunity. And with SPACs having a limited downside, I can't see why not. Noone has time to follow and DD dozens of stocks.
Oh, I know. It’s all iTrade.

never forget that ppl in the market are trying to take your money. like actively trying to take it from you.

Expc😤🚀🚀
GameStop claims that it can "optimize" its core business by improving its operating efficiencies, optimizing its inventories, growing higher-margin product categories, and "rationalizing" its global store base. In other words, it wants to cut costs and reduce its global base of over 5,700 stores.

During the conference call, CFO Jim Bell stated that GameStop already closed 195 stores over the past year, that it was "on track to close between 180 and 200 underperforming stores globally by the end of this fiscal year," and that a "much larger tranche of closures" would occur over the next two years.

That's not a turnaround strategy -- it's what desperate brick-and-mortar retailers do to boost their earnings as their revenues fall off a cliff.
I’m with you dawg. The Big Kahuna is coming this year post-Jan 20.

Not sure if or where that information is available. All we know is the float is going to expand. It depends on how much profit insiders want to take.

lol you guys are insane
This was me after a big win last week on AMZN, up $12,000 and was chasing $20,000 only to cash out at $8,000.

Still gainz but that $4,000 I lost chasing is a big chunk.

Definitely wished I would have sat out for a week or two and just been happy with that hit.  Good advice and sound like it comes from experience!
still know long term OPEN will print
Yeah. Read your post history. Nikola to $50 was a great call. Or the AAPL $150 by EOY?

You made a couple good calls. Couple shit calls. Calm down.
Not a chance dude
Pussies 😂😂😂
excellent
Nothing needs to be "backed up" with shorts. An argument about valuation isn't mathematically different based on what positions you hold on a stock. 

Asking someone to short something if they're sure it's overvalued is the refuge of a moron who can't disprove the argument itself, basically an ad hominem.

Clone High. Was big ca. 2002-2003 (hard to believe that was about 18 years ago now).
The position was overweight. That’s why they’re selling.
I'm going to need to see insolvency result in bankruptcies and discharged debts... and I'm going to need to see it on a large scale.

...and I just don't see that happening in the next six months.

What I do see is the FedResInk buying more and more and more US debt to make bond auction failures disappear.   I see rates going negative (they're already effectively negative after inflation) with Yellen at the Treasury and Gerome departing in a year.  I see the FedResInk+Treasury doubling down on return-free-risk displacing "risk free return".  I see a continuing and accelerating rush into asset classes that are still vaguely accretive (including ones that are strictly driven by short term supply and demand like equities and bitcon).  I don't see a weak dollar helping American exports and I see continued erosion of central bank credibility world wide, leading to a sea change in the world wide settlement unit of account.  All of this will be good for US equities, possibly resulting in sideways movement at ATHs until the world finally realizes (yes, Virginia, the majority investor in US equities markets are ex-US) that the US equities market will not have a growth return for them.... and then, when that realization sinks in, there will be a move to another asset class that does.

Nah, that argument is the retort of a child who has no factual counter to the value argument, so they want to compare ~~dick~~ position sizes instead.  Often something can be overvalued but still not a smart idea to short.  

TSLA is a fantastic example. Absolutely garbage valuation that only a brain damaged fanboy can even think of defending, but you'd be an idiot to short that momentum until it reverses.

Thank god I lost so much money and don’t have to worry about this...
Dude they’ve had declining YOY quarterly sales. YEARS.
I agree with you, shorts have plenty of ammo left but imo the catalyst is 1st the fact that the bankrupt thesis is gone and 2nd that GME successfully pivots to an ecommerce / esports / gaming powerhouse. GME really is the only dominant specialty retailer in the sector. It’s a thousands times harder for any competitor to build the customer base and reach of GameStop than it is to GME to pivot to an ecommerce “omnichannel” centric business.

Then it will be a matter of valuation and 0.3x sales (even 1x sales!) should be undervalued. Personally, I think this shift is not a matter of if will happen but how long it will take and how well executed it will be. The fact that RC is in play seriously speeds this transition. 

I’m holding shares (5.500) since 8-9$ and playing FDs and leaps. The MOASS is fun but I’m not selling below a ~4x sales valuation or until I see this thesis go bust.

Edit: spelling
10,000 long PLTR. Average cost 23. Don’t care what the Monday morning quarterbacks say. Imma hold on to this stock, till it makes me a millionaire. The so called doomsday experts said the same about TSLA, a year ago. PLTR finna make us rich within 5 years.
Remember TSLA had it’s IPO 10 years ago!!!!! Chill the fuck out and hold on to your PLTR.

I've started a new social media platform. It takes the best parts of My Space and Facebook and combined them. I call it "Myface"... how'd you like to be on it?
Not in GME but honestly that's probably a good thing if you are losing money on keeping them open
Cooking the books? Perhaps. That’s just how companies do accounting. Even in the us, companies can manipulate their financial statements with fifo and lifo for example 

But nio is a solid company. If you actually did some research, you would know.

Anyway, you do you.

Well you need more tools beside that, the phone only substitutes a fancy fluorescent reader AFAIK. If they get to mass produce this, however, it could be like a DIY pregnancy test but for covid. This might take a long time though. What is interesting and makes it worth to long is that the target virus can be substituted so it is potentially useful for future epidemics or pandemics.

I bought some retarded NIO lotto tickets at close on Thursday. Looks like I'm maybe not as retarded as I thought.

So how many Americans even know about the mass stabbing committed by the Uyghurs, hmm?

Or is it thanks to our media that they only hear about CCP doing wrong and never about the Uyghurs committing terrorism (going all the way back to the '90s), against many of whom were NOT part of the CCP?

Why don't most of us know about this and why weren't these all over our mainstream media, if we're supposedly so "fair" and "unbiased"?

If Tesla is only the value of cars and solar, there is no more upside left. 

Annual new car sales in the U.S. is about $545B and annual solar is $19B. 

Tesla is priced for owning 100% market share of both industries plus about 20% on top of that?

Lag is absolutely terrible with Google Stadia and shit like that, not worth suffering through that just to save a buck in the short term, as a consumer. It's a niche market that won't catch mainstream popularity at least for another 15-20 years. It's just not worth it.

Most casual and hardcore gamers these days have their own consoles, PCs... I built my own PC, mid-tier, can run all modern games at low/mid settings. There's multiple ways for GME to pivot into a profitable, growing company. I am not a full-blown believer, but I can see how this stock hits $30+ in the next few months, easily.

At the end of the day it will be the same. Honestly it may be even more with EVs given the lifespan of the batteries. I would never buy a used EV. So I'm not sure why you would buy one new. Lifespan of the batteries just doesn't do it for me. Having to replace the most expensive component of a car every 10 years or less sounds unreasonable. It will be interesting to watch it all unfold.

Sometimes on fridays I would gather a few co-workers I like to hang-out with, we’d go to a restaurant nearby get a fat royal couscous and some wine. Productivity level would decrease 65% in the aftermath of the afternoon but who cares, friday is your window to the week-end. Good times.

Best part? Employer pays 50% of the bill, by law.
Pretty sure we crash when every news outlet marks the 100 year anniversary of the Great Depression.

I was going to hit every Target and Walmart and buy the Bounty double roll packs. They only allow you to buy one of each. They’re like $9. Them resell them on Amazon in the dead of winter covid.

Lol look man. GME was a rare gem and it was pure hilarity that retards were profiting more off of a broken down retailer facing extinction than many stocks the so called "experts" were pitching us. But a lot of us got in GME when it was in the single digits and we've made our money.

I'm sorry for anyone who missed out on this, but it's being held together purely by memes and idiots FOMOing in to it. It has a habit of crashing after the new console cycle hype is gone.. and that time is coming. It's gonna be the same fuckin story as the bagholders who got in PLTR at the top and refuse to accept defeat. Move on or hold the bags. Your call
For the lads that are looking to buy certain SPAC’s that are still relatively cheap. I recommend Big Fuckin Tendies. TH BR and G I K. Fintech is huge and Foley is headlining it so it’s a pretty well full proof. Other one is semiconductors which has a huge market in EV’s and they’re really the first Spac to do so. And then the third is lightning motors which of course any EV is gonna blow up but they actually have a good product just a bit behind with regards to production.

538 is okay, but it's been a trend now for over 4 years that polls have underestimated Republican voters, for whatever reason. In that timespan, prediction/betting markets have been more accurate.

In my experience, nobody posts their actual high value secrets until they're played out. There may be room to run but the market is already way overvalued so why risk getting into SPAC warrants like TDACW now? Okay so it can run to $4.50 after the business combination. There is a reason I still own some, after all. But I like to capture the easy first 50% of appreciation and hopefully scrape out a few percent more as I scale out. If the market doesn't go down, you'll make a ton of money on SPAC warrants. But why risk it? You can short the next drop by buying VX futures even with a small account.
Sir this is not /r/investing. Take your common sense elsewhere.

This is a very important distinction. When people talk about a company being valued as a "tech company", that doesn't simply mean a company that works on technology. Yes, software is technology, but so is literally everything from agriculture to manufacturing. When people talk about being valued "as a tech company", they're talking about unexpected disruptive innovation like Apple getting into Smartphones, Netflix getting into streaming, or Amazon doing cloud computing. These are all completely unrelated to their company's original intended purpose, started at a time when their core business was profitable, and yet managed to become the most profitable part of their business. A business must be willing to take risk and avoid getting siloed into a specific domain space for this type of growth to be possible. This is reflected much more by methadology and leadership than domain.

This is why, for example, Dell is not valued the same way as Apple. Not only do you need to price in the potential for Apple to grow into tangential industries or completely reimagine their core product, but you also need to factor in Dell getting put out of business due to complacency. So always make sure when valuing a "tech company" that you actually understand if it's an Apple or a Dell before going balls deep on tech hype.

Good for you man! I bought at $5 but then sold at $5 only to realize how stupid I was in November and buy back at $30. Only could afford 1200 at that price but I think within the coming years Nio will be the next major EV company and the only one to really rival tsla

I researched every single company and called the leadership in every SPAC and tried to build relationships with them so I could get a feel for what's going on in their minds. Currently, I wouldn't be putting money in SPACs unless you have good information about them and almost all of these guys raising money now are not competent. In addition to that, there are just so many entities that there's no way even 80% of the capital will be allocable to target companies. It's a massive bubble and unfortunately a lot of founding teams are going to get burned. I wanted to open my own SPAC as a career goal and was just invited into my first one as a founder. Anyone who wants 50% discounted newSPAC common stock can talk to me in private I guess. But I don't love the risk reward even with a massive margin of safety and an amazing team, because it could be a year before I get my money back and in that time I could do a lot better than +100%.

Stuff like this really gives me blue balls when the markets closed on weekends.
watch the elon and jack ma vid on YouTube and you'll see how retarded Jack is.  He let it get to his head and probably ran his mouth too often.  

The last incident was probably not the only incident and likely was the straw that broke the camel's back and the ccp had to show him who's boss.
Oh Yeah? But does he lits up a fat blunt with Joey Rogan and tweets about existential dilemmas while on lsd? No? I thought so...

The risk of owning equity is that it goes to zero, and you have no liquidation preference. 

In Palantir's case, due to their deep roots in alphabet agencies, there is no risk of going to zero.

I don’t understand why you’re choosing to argue and call me a troll instead of just admitting that COVID-19 is not, as you said, “tracking Spanish flu almost exactly”

I gave you the numbers. You then googled them yourself.

Even taking the lowest estimate of Spanish Flu deaths, less than 1/10th of that have died of COVID in 1/2 the time. That’s it. If you continue to debate on this you’re obviously the one who is trolling.

There is actually some truth to this. Despite some donkeys here that spout liberal progressive communist gay fuckery they are really greedy capitalists and entrepreneurs at heart and really don’t want to give THEIR money to comrade AOC and the like. They want to make money, fuck whores, smoke weed, order DoorDash, and enjoy watching broke bitch wage slaves, who never took a risk in their life, burn while they sleep in everyday, and only wake up to a blowjob by some skeezy with big tits.

Tards together strong. I sold back when B T C was back at 19k but got around 2000 shares of GME at an average price $16.5. A little sad I’ve missed this weeks gains but the potential opportunity to take part in an infinity squeeze was too good to pass up. also hoping I can increase my position in B T C with my GME gains once this is done. God speed fellow tard.

My friend T-bone (fake nickname, but he'll know I'm talking about him if he's on here) told me about WSB back in 2018. I was so overly conservative and found it difficult to hold onto positions. Reading all your crazy posts actually helped me build up a little self-confidence to hold positions. So thank you guys. Appreciate the lessons a lot.

You youngins should appreciate free trades these days.

Back until what like 4 years ago it was expensive to trade. $7 a pop added up at year end. I'm saving atleast 6k a year from fees now vs before. 

Anyways carry on
The extra 7 is only so that the 7000 doesn’t look suspicious.
Assuming MOASS does happen (I doubt it, but whatever...), I think $100 is a "reasonable" price where you can start pulling out some of your cash.

Nobody knows how high it can go, mostly because a lot of paperhands are gonna be selling as soon as it goes 2x for them ($30, $40, $50...)
Very nice graphic.

How did you choose to only bet on a few SPACs?
What was the criteria?

For me, I'm throwing 5 to 10k into warrants at < 1.50 in "good" SPACs.

But it looks like you were in warrants at like $0.2ish.
Maybe the warrant market it to hot to replicate your returns now.

I've been researching the SPAC market since 2017, right when they were taking off. I DD'd every single company out there and read all new SPAC SEC filings. I am only posting about it now because I think the market is at a peak. Don't get into it and chase me. I do think my remaining TDACW position still has room to run well into the 3s and 4s after they formally announce the business combination and de-SPAC in Q1 2021. But I have too many shares and I'd rather sacrifice some upside for an offensive cash position if the market gets a Q1 tummy ache. I'll be selling a probably 200k TDACW every day for the rest of the week if you guys wanna buy some from me. Once my selling pressure keeping a cap on the price is gone, it should have an easier time going up (if it is going to do so). But that's just a simple trading tactic, not anything fundamental.
I don’t think the selloff when the shares come available is priced in at the moment. It will probably get in the teens. I’m DCA’ing and I’ll buy calls after lockup-expiry. 300 shares now, aiming to get 3000 shares

Weekend at Xi's
In reality, not much. I was invited into some private placements but I don't trust the market nor do I trust any SPAC players in it. There are too many blank check companies chasing too few targets. Currently cashing out of everything slowly so as to not upset the market.

Then, going to do theta-gang index option income trades until I see index volume evaporate to buy /VX e-mini futures right at the cusp of a correction (or if I miss that, short /VX on the way back down because it just won't be elevated for more than a week and I can take the pain).

Will be buying OTM puts with a small percentage of the account if I see some good shorting opportunities. We could still go up a lot more this year. But my YOLO days are over because I can no longer replace this chunk of change in a single year like I could have back when I was going balls to the wall in 2017-2019 turning $3K into the $44K you see at the beginning of 2020.

TSLA is such a shit of piece company.  They put bad parts in their Chinese factory and sell these cars to China and ship these cars to Europe for regulatory EV credit

**Note:**  Event though TSLA sold 500K vehicle.  The biggest sales this quarter was in China. But China regulartory EV credits pay far less than US and Europe, so even though they sold alot more TSLA cars, operating profits will be only marginally up because China share of EV credit has gone up.

.... It's a gamble that depends on their ability to make an actual profit,  growing revenue without growing their operating expenses. Since for now their operating expenses seems to be just growing on par with revenue, it's a no for me ATM. They are investing a lot, I get it .... but there is no free cashflow at the moment, so I'd wait another quarter or two. But thanks for the contribution of actual DD and good luck with your YOLO

Very much this. 

Gaybears frightened me into selling in September after the earnings report. I took a very, very small loss, but the much bigger loss I took is not locking in my $7.73 average buy price. I would've already more than 2x-ed my money since then. Now it's "only" a 55% gain. Still good, and I still think this can easily go 3x, but man, talk about a missed opportunity.
Idk why you were downvoted, China knew about corona since late 2019 and actively hid it from the international community while gradually buying up PPP. They allegedly got the virus under control (don't belive what China says) but they did this by literally welding people into buildings. Not to mention those pesky concentration camps.

Where the fuck are you getting data on Spanish flu deaths tracked over time? There isn't even an agreed upon death count for the Spanish flu. It varies from 17 to 50 million.

The most glaring point is that people were buying feverishly over crumbs of news about chump change contracts. It’s still going on today. Every time Palantir breaths an article gets pumped on wsb. They post articles that are six months old. 

That’s the danger of every meme stock. Companies who deserve the valuation (eventually) get overbought way too early. It’s normal to price in the future but Palantir never offered additional shares on the direct listing, it’s all company owned in the float so I can see how retail grabbed such a high percentage. The long term share and leap holders are going to win with PLTR.

GME is going to suffer from the same issue as well. It gets hardcore pumped so retail assumes the sentiment means the stock price is going to continue moving up in the near term. When that doesn’t immediately pan out they get skittish during pullbacks, sell and resent the stock. Then over time the stock continues to rise. Similar to how everyone wrote off NIO but it’s wasn’t done climbing.
This is the way

meh. Considering the unusually explosive nature of the crash, one could argue that the battery damage contribution was surprisingly light. Looks like a tire caused most of the damage.

> The damage from the collision caused the batteries from the Tesla to enter two different residences by breaking through the windows, one landing on a person’s lap and the second landing on a bed, catching the bedding on fire," wrote the City of Corvallis Police Department in a statement. "A tire was ripped from the car during the collision and struck the second story siding of a nearby apartment complex with such force that it ruptured the water pipes within the wall, destroying the bathroom to the apartment and flooding the downstairs portion of the apartment as well.

Just read about the Matewan Massacre shootout. They gotta make a movie about the battle of Blair Mountain. This shit would be incredible: 

> As the agents walked to the train station to leave town, Police Chief Sid Hatfield and a group of deputized miners confronted them and told them they were under arrest. Albert Felts replied that in fact he had a warrant for Hatfield's arrest.[15] Testerman was alerted, and he ran out into the street after a miner shouted that Sid had been arrested. Hatfield backed into the store and Testerman asked to see the warrant. After reviewing it, Mayor Testerman exclaimed, "This is a bogus warrant." With these words, a gunfight erupted and Chief Hatfield shot the agent Albert Felts. Testerman and Albert and Lee Felts were among the ten men killed


Just that standoff, then “This is a bogus warrant.” And gunfire erupts. Shit would be amazing.

Apple has a way of giving people what they want before they even know they want it. They get hate every single time for it, then a couple years down the line the product is everywhere. Just keep that in mind.

Just a few random examples:
-No typing on iPod, just a wheel?
-We need keys, typing on a touch screen is too hard
-iPads are big phones, useless
- headphones with no wire? Gonna get lost or fall out I won’t buy them 
- I don’t need texts on my wrist, smart watches useless

The list goes on.... and while I tend to agree with you, the history of apple getting hate and then proving their idea was just what we needed happens over and over

Yes. This is my strategy. Hear some buzz? -Do some research. If it passes the sniff test? -invest what you can and go back about your business. 

I totally ignore my ROTH & 401K, and take great joy in seeing those bi-annual reviews that show 8.9%-11.6% growth figures. It’s the long game. I just remind myself that I’ve still got ~25 years to go, so in essence, it’s not worth much focus. The habit is more important now. Stocks I will pay a little more attention to, but lightly. I’m still driving the 19 year old truck I bought new when I was stupid with money, so I’m used to buying and holding. 

Man I really appreciate your help. This has been a breath of fresh air compared to most of the shit I see on wsb. I’m grateful you took the time. Thank you.

NIO 7007 deliveries in December! To the moon this week
I never know whuch one to buy until it's too late
I think you would be wrong.   Also vetoing the defense bill with military raises didn't do him any favors.
nobody buys sedans anymore :(
The board would oust you before you could make a decision that reduces the product margins by so much. Now you're no longer CEO and your company still sources from China.

I personally think NIO has another red/flat week. 

43K deliveries in all of 2020 VS. 100k Model Y orders in China in just one week

So.. I turned on a thing where you can't repost images anymore. If your meme gets stopped by a bot or something *do not just repost it over and over with different flairs and titles and expect something to change.* Just a fair warning so your excellent meme doesn't fall into the cracks.

Just message us. pls.

I worked as a contractor for Palantir for a couple of years (pre-IPO) and they struggled with their service model to support the platform. Palantir’s bread and butter is their team of devs and engineers who build out the customized components of the platform but at that time it seemed difficult (read: bleeding out shares) to produce a realistic M&O transition to the client. Their previous business model relied heavily on hiring contractors to providing ongoing technical/help desk support with a heavy emphasis on training users, however they are a software company and not a service company so they canned a lot of their professional services when the board realized they were losing too much on the services aspect. 

It’s like a graph database on roids with some geospatial pumps. The current industry/use cases is more focused on finding/connecting people through exposed data. Where they’ve always struggled is with managing data quality as you essentially share the content on your network with everyone else on that network and people are constantly fucking things up like entity resolution (I.e. Dude 1  merges an entity with another entity with a similar name, Dude 2 is posed because this is NOT the same dude and now they need to unfuck the dude cluster. It’s like a graph database on roids with some geospatial capabilities. 

Curious as to what you mean by functioning more like Oracle and less like an up and comer?

It seems like the platform could be changed to tackle different industries such as healthcare (provider/care management), insurance (claims management), and maybe logistics/operations (route optimization). There are other much more established organizations already owning these industries but it still seems scalable for them if they wanted to go that route.

Worth embellishing... 

Before having a computer and around the 80s, people typed on a typewriter. Any kind of bookkeeping or data entry was done in a ledger book. To add up those numbers, a business would use a calculator or for most, you did it in your head or worked it out on paper. Printing... pre-computer era, they also had xerox machines (few and slower) and crappy ditto machines.

Please for the love of god is there a dictionary somewhere I knew I wasn’t the only one who is lost literally all I know is Bull is up and Bear is down please
I know everyone is saying fuck China, and I agree from a technical standpoint, but I hope everyone realize the ultra gay bear position that is. China is the “unicorn” that has been pumping tech stocks. The treasury and federal reserve couldn’t pump up the stock market as much as China pumped it up. When they decide to sell out there will be a crash like none other. Instead of halting trading of those companies, we should halt the Chinese institutions from investing in American stocks.       

TL;DR the only way to make sure China doesn’t hurt the market is to suspend Chinese institutional trading on American/European markets.

Gambling is always a zero sum game. No additional value can be created by gambling in slots/cards except for personal entertainment. Investing in stocks/real estate is not supposed to be like gambling. It is supposed to be a way to provide financing at a fair price for businesses. It creates a competitive environment for investors/businesses alike. 

In a country without a developed financial system it can be difficult to find financing for businesses so a lot of potential wealth is not created. That's why if you look at the poorest nations in the world almost all of them suffer from a poorly defined or corrupt financial system. If you can't trust that your investment is legitimate then you are less likely to invest.

Now does me buying a share of AAPL from someone else create wealth? Not really but being in a public market has absolutely created wealth for AAPL holders and the company itself which can now generate more capital by selling more stock. They've expanded the number of potential shareholders from a few billionaires to everyone. As a whole the stock market is a good thing for society as ordinary people can own a slice of large businesses and profit when they do well. Now that being said, what we are seeing now in the stock market is rapidly approaching speculation and gambling levels. What people are doing on WSB is 100% gambling.
That sounds pretty gay tbh but yeah they're cool creatures. I appreciate how if I get shot my horse will take me to the hospital if it's smart enough but unlike a Tesla the government can't just hack in and command it to drown me in a river. People would definitely still have horses as the typical thing instead of cars if the government didn't make having a horse and a car at the same time unaffordable and then make choosing a horse over a car unaffordable by building infrastructure that requires cars for the sake of the oil industry -_-

I think $NIO will have a good year this year. I could see it hitting $100+ by the end of 2021. NIO Day should be good. I am hoping they have some awesome announcements. Don't believe the people that say everything is priced in. If that was true, we would never see a stock rise in the first place. Sometimes stocks just moon to moon. Good luck with your holdings. I  for one am holding August calls. NIO has helped me out a lot and I believe it will continue to do so.

Even in the paragraph that mentioned insolvency you clearly read and were unable to grasp:

>When their balance sheets are impaired, banks have incentives to roll over loans to non-viable firms rather than writing them off. Formal evidence suggests that weak banks indeed played a role in the wake of the GFC (Storz et al (2017), Schivardi et al (2017)). By inhibiting corporate restructuring, poorly designed insolvency regimes were also at work (Andrews and Petroulakis (2017)).

Poorly designed insolvency regimes meaning policies in place that prevented insolvent firms from going through a normal process of bankruptcy when they should have, were instead given loans, effectively borrowing out of insolvency. Although the cause in this case was not attributed to ZIRP.

Well you are wrong about that because I've picked up more than 20 followers in past few days and in the past I've been posting lots of different topics but I'm getting the most followers posting about UAO.  

 Also the data is different. 

Noone else is providing the data we have because:

1. We're not doing individual sweeps, but contracts at a given strike point.
2. Low money sweeps are being filtered out
3. They are being added together per expiry and also now total of all expiry dates. 

You will not find any other location with the same data I'm providing you. 

Thats ok, keep hating.

>Another potential, more general factor is the downward trend in interest rates. Mechanically, lower rates should reduce our measure of zombie firms as they improve ICRs by reducing interest expenses, all else equal. However, low rates can also reduce the pressure on creditors to clean up their balance sheets and encourage them to “evergreen” loans to zombies (Borio and Hofmann (2017)).

Point being you don’t know what evergreen loans are and you’re a fucking douchebag as well.

The firms they selected as zombie firms also don’t have expectations for things to turn around. Says it elsewhere in the paper that was a particular key aspect of their methodology in picking them.

These are non viable firms that would be insolvent if not for continued low interest loans.

It seems hard for you to understand lots of text though, I get it. All good.

I would, but the puts I would bet are too expensive for me because so many people are buying them, because the company is garbage.
Made 600k on Nordstrom, at one point the company was trading at 1/4 of its precovid value. It was a no brainer, it has since doubled. People often forget that with an ample margin do safety(buy cheap enough) 
, you’re able to go balls to the wall on leverage or options. Essentially going Yolo on a company that is currently trading at 1/4 of its pre pandemic valuation is less risky than going yolo on the latest meme stock. Things to generally return to the mean, especially now with the vaccine distribution underway.

Okay good idea. I just searched on google and glassdoor and found they get pretty average reviews for a tech company. Rating on glassdoor is 3.9/5 and difficulty of interview a 3.2/5.

Authoritarian states have dramatically increased their regional and global influence since the advent of the internet, whereas liberal regimes have devolved into more fractious societies with increasingly ossified political leadership classes 

China isn't communist, it's a state capitalist system

a society in which billionaires exist, own the means of production and profit off of working class labour is by definition not communist 

but believe whatever you want I don't care
Honestly, I don't even know if he is a real doctor at this point.
I would agree, my own analysis points to a continuation of the sell but will probably come back up after about $22

I kinda think that trump and xi are both standing on the same side for this matter, see, trump wants to delist China companies in US market and Xi wants jack ma to dump in more money into China rather that having them all flown out to invest in foreign countries such as US


short term: baba is most likely to be moving sideways 

Long term: jack ma is forced to sell most of his baba shares to the CCP. Ants will be forced to liquidate some of its foreign investments but still bullish though considering that baba is then being backed by the entire China


In short, jack ma is fucked and will be fucked even harder, but that’s just him alone , it wouldn’t affect baba much and baba will continue its course to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Do you think inventory is low solely because of the millions (numbers are all over the place) of pending evictions, unable to be enacted due to the moratoriums? That's my current thesis, I see a big sell off and market flood when the moratoriums end.
But then consumers will pay $500 every 10 years instead of $1200 every 12 months.
Actually yes. Off with their heads comrades!

It took some hit year-end but now is a good time to be bullish on ARK
It is simply expressing the idea that working in absolute thinking is bad. Devil is a more general form of bad than Sith. The devil doesn’t have to be biblical as it has become a common notion of bad.

From google:

> A devil is the personification of evil as it is conceived in various cultures and religious traditions. It is seen as the objectification of a hostile and destructive force.
Maybe but a wise trader once said to look for consensus that the market isn’t confirming. Seems like everyone is bullish on this stock, loving the slack buy and yet all the stock does is go down. If a stock can’t act at least as well as the market you should assume something is wrong imo, especially when consensus is the opposite

Stock looked like it had bottomed at $220, quickly rose to $233 or so a couple weeks ago and then went straight back to $220 this past week. Just acting terribly
$56.90 you retarded peanut.
Made me feel better about my 5,500 @26.49
No, you’re off there. It’s at least 9%
I have this is exact same sentiment as well. I think there's a lot of backlash on this idea because so many new homeowners bought their first house due to low interest rates, and don't want to believe they bought at the peak. Especially ITT. 

I think after the eviction moratorium, landlords will evict, and try to sell immediately to recoup losses from missed rent payments and pay off the forbearance. That's exactly what I would do if I was in that situation since housing prices are so damn high and it's a seller's market. Tsunami of inventory and nobody to buy. 

The only question I can't answer is, if people are buying homes like hotcakes now, why would that stop even with added inventory in 6 months?
The price target when this unaudited ADR hype fade away and you end up with shitty fundamentals,    Cook the book, adrs are for crooks

This isn’t a philosophical debate: “Only the Devil deals in absolutes” makes zero sense. 

There are *dozens* of instances when God, the *opposite* of the Devil, speaks in absolutes. Canonically. In the Bible. There’s nothing anti-Christian or Abrahamic about speaking in absolutes. That’s specifically a Jedi thing. 

It doesn’t work, it’s not deep.

I've been writing weeklies for the last month.   Write on Tues,  slightly OTM because we've been going sideways and I've been getting good premiums.    I'm not writing any going into NIO day..  

 If there is a pop on Monday, I will drop 1/2 of those contracts and take profit.  I'll use that money to increase my Xpeng holdings.    I'm starting to have too many eggs in the NIO basket, even though I fully expect them to grow at a much faster pace than Tesla.    I'm not touching my shares..
I'm balls deep in BABA 1/15 270c. Ride till I die or redeem for 12 bucks? Cost was $1200. Only down two 0's.

It's not a "shell company" that's how ADR's work either they are deposited into a bank and the bank holds these ADR's and enjoys the equity rights while shareholders of ADR'S do not. Or the company directly deals the ADR's and the shareholders enjoy the same rights of the equity holder. Every company has offshores to aid in currency risk hedging and tax reductions. Don't see you complaining about apples complex network of tax evasion do I?

one last non-meme comment before bed:

A few weeks ago, an institutional vol [trader](https://twitter.com/Ksidiii/status/1337413651947524098) was mentioning 1-month smile differences among ARKK, ARKW, and ARKG (really note this one) and vol arb opportunities among them and their constituents. There's too many combinations to run through.

A few days later, Bloomberg ran an article about a JPM-concocted “structured YOLO” product in those exact funds, probably not a coincidence. The same trader is quoted in the [article.](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-14/jpmorgan-offers-you-only-live-once-trade-to-bet-on-ark-etfs)

recent non-vol-arb trades: re-added to ARKK, ARKG and SQ Tuesday out to 2022 (Dec 21 in ARKG) after heavy profit-taking, mostly spreads. Getting good ARKG fills is rough, also sold some ITM puts. Once you go past Feb, ITM ARKG puts are not so liquid. Will add more next week if there are good opportunities.

NIO's founder has successfully created and sold two multi billion dollar firms. One being China's pretty much only used car sales app. He's a genius and academically way smarter than Elon is tbh, just look at his background, he did 3 undergrads at once at Peking (which is harder to get into compared to Harvard). While doing this he also worked many part time jobs as well and was instrumental during the first tech boom in China.

I'm surprised we aren't all apart of the pltr singularity yet.
So where do you draw the line? Founding fathers were wrong to have a revolution because it incurred losses for rich people? Protesters were wrong to deface Mitch's house because it incurred losses for rich people? Mitch shouldn't have defaced his own house because he's too rich to have to sacrifice anything? Just curious which type of retard you are, because there are the "poor people should pretend to stand up for themselves without actually going past x threshold to make it real, I wish they didn't care so much about their lives and would just focus on the theatrics for me" and then there are also the "I wish poor people would just magically stop standing up for themselves at all" type

Insolvency is mentioned just once in that document. A zombie company doesn't have to be an insolvent company.

>  defined as firms that are unable to cover debt
servicing costs from current profits over an extended period

It says it right in the first sentence. 'over a longer period of time'. So they're not insolvent yet, but they will be if things don't get better.
And close to insolvency isn't insolvent.

6400 shares averaged@ $18.10,  40 5/21 $35C averaged@ $4.10

I might experience one of those days on Monday that I read about here from TSLA owners on a weekly basis.  I was hoping for NIO to come close to their target,  not smashing the estimate.  

A huge fuck-you to the "Nio is limited to 5,000 because of chip issues" guy.   I won't even bother searching for his name here.

**What is even more important than these numbers you ask?** 

 *"With the 100kWh battery pack offered as an option, the penetration of BaaS has reached over 40% among new orders in December"*

Gamer culture will keep GameStop alive. I really like Ryan Cohen's vision for the physical locations. He wants to make it into a real experience to walk into a gamestop. I can imagine them just turning over to a model where the physical stores sell tons of gamer merch and collectibles while also having really good subscription models for actual games. Also breaking out into PC gaming parts/accessories/games could be big. And just making the experience of walking into gamestop feel like you're stepping into fucking donkey Kong country or some shit. Gamers would love it, kids would love it, and parents would love the prices on subscription models as opposed to putting their credit card information in the PS5 and letting little Billy rack up $1000 bill every month on fortnite skins

Why waste your time with Fluor? These big boomer dynasties never pump because they never offer anything new. These engineering/construction companies obtain meager government contracts that they’ll never lose (until they sell to the next corporation in tow Bechtel, GE Etc.). Most of the white collar work force is doing Dilbert-esque paperwork stuff and the blue collar work force is unionized out the ass. The NuScale bullshit is local to me and it’s looking like it might not even happen at this point. This company has no incentives to actually grow and is at the whims of whatever congress wants to do at the time.

>Just not loans directly from the FED, of course. 

Right, fair that’s all I needed to say.

>Just loans to buy stocks in the hope the greater fool will buy them later for more. Or of course, what stocks should be, to get a profit from the company. However, it seems like we're in la la land again and claiming profits don't matter.

Personally I look at it like this: it’s not buying with hopes that there’s a greater fool who will buy stocks from me at a higher price in the future per say, rather it’s simply foolish to hold cash under the fed’s infinite money printing regime, and it’s marginally more prudent to lock in low interest cash obligations to purchase risky assets in that world. In a way, it’s offloading the dollar to the greater fool tbh. Like to that guy in the thread lol. He’s in la la land claiming cash is a haven under the current fed.

>However, it seems like we're in la la land again and claiming profits don't matter.

Evidently they matter significantly less with a fed that prints infinite cash to prop up markets. Companies are still going bankrupt so all is not completely crazy, but way more would’ve gone bankrupt had the fed not done what they did.

"Western Europe, where Xiaomi sales soared 107% over the previous year, contributed significantly to revenue growth. According to the company, Xiaomi is now the third best-selling brand in the region, occupying 13.3% of the market.

Xiaomi says it is the second-most popular brand in Italy, third in France, fourth in Germany, and has been Spain’s preferred smartphone brand for three quarters. "

I found something interesting: 

NIO delivered ***17,353*** vehicles this quarter, which is close to Tesla's 2017 quarters in absolute numbers. Tesla had a market cap of around 50B at that time. This means that, if NIO can 10x their deliveries in the upcoming years, their market cap (60B) could 10x if they reach Tesla's market cap (660B). The sales/deliveries numbers are highly correlated to Tesla's, and the market cap as well.
I don't know in which part of Eu are you living, or what's your "status" but at least in Italy and Spain a lot of people between 20-35 years have the Xiaomi red mi note 9 or 8. It's usual for people in the same table to switch phone, because everyone have a Xiaomi.

Good question. I expect that refinance I can get a bit cheaper by bundling it with my mortgage. I think it’s a bit irrelevant in my case because in 3 years we will probably be ready for something else. 

More likely we sell and pay off the loan. As you state, we would take a depreciation hit. I have estimated this to be 25% in 3 years. 130 000 nok (roughly 15.000) usd. So that’s essentially the cost we pay for 3 years. 

I compared these factors and other costs vs buying a cheap used Audi A3 and came to the conclusion that the costs were actually pretty similar. The analysis may not be the same though in the US where gas cars are much cheaper than here

> Lower interest rates incentivizes yield chasers to take out loans and place cash in financial assets, including risky endeavors, like Tesla or junk bonds or subprime auto loans. Or to take out loans and binge on stock buybacks.

Just not loans directly from the FED, of course. Just loans to buy stocks in the hope the greater fool will buy them later for more. Or of course, what stocks should be, to get a profit from the company. However, it seems like we're in la la land again and claiming profits don't matter.

Hoping to overwhelm the listener with the sheer volume of your stupidity.

None of the things you say here are even interesting, even if one extracts from them the kernel of truth.  It's like in a relationship where the narcissist starts trying to insult someone for bizarre reasons that are, at best, orthogonal to the actual weaknesses of the person they're attacking.

Tesla's "problem" is that their valuation has a lot of exponential growth priced in, and their absolute growth is limited by the size of the global economy.  Like its $trillion cap peers, it's simply impossible to grow by another factor of 100.  The world doesn't have that much utility to give right now.  That makes its valuation tricky because there are a lot of execution risks going forward, and those are no longer compensated by corresponding rewards.  When Tesla was $200 pre-split, investors could factor in scenarios with a 50x upside; that is no longer possible.

But you screaming that, I don't know, "Tesla's market share in the Netherlands is plummeting!" when it's because Tesla has decided to stop shipping cars to EU for a given quarter is... laughable.  Or really sad.  And I'm sorry for the cognitive dissonance you impose on yourself every day.

7000 cars with a 62 billion dollar valuation. Do you really think mooning is in order? 

Even if we pretend their cars sold for $50,000 and each car sold was 100% profit then their income this year is only 350 million. 

I understand Tesla because Tesla is literally trying to change the world with cutting edge technology so they're not only a car company. NIO on the other hand is a joke Chinese bootleg company riding on Tesla's back.

If anything those appalling numbers should make this stock crash tomorrow. I hope you all get out of it before it's too late.

Warren B striking out on R4s. My man has been taking many Ls lately.
Who said anything about lizard people, Rothschilds or anything of that nature? Again, I am heavily against conspiracy theories. However, there is no denying the fact that there is one oversight committee. There is also no denying the fact that we have no way to *truly* verify, other than posting information the Fed themselves put online. 

This topic was brought up back in later March/early April here on WSB. Many people in the banking industry shared stories of their bank's management telling employees to enter in select digits into large corporate accounts back in 2008. No questions asked. These didn't come directly from management either. Again, I'm no conspiracy theorist but I would not be surprised, at all, if that were true. These posts/comments didn't come from one Reddit account either. Dozens of people in the financial sector had similar stories.

The fact that you believe that something like this *can't* happen is shocking.

Just wait, ez.
Better lower that income immediately since support is always tied to that. It's always easier to negotiate from a low point than getting it lowered later after you have actual bad income outcomes. Right now the system will just think you're a brokeass. Trying to lower it later after you get fired, they'll think you're trying to cheat the system and the mother and take you to admistrative hell.

We sound like we'd be buddies. Float studios are fucking awesome but they don't hold a candle to psychedelics imo. Those things help me with depression so much, and help me realize how useless being depressed is. There's no reason to feel bad for yourself you are meant to enjoy this life, seize it with whatevert he fuck you have before it goes away. Those experiences teach me to hunt down more novel experiences and are powerful medicine for people if not jsut a great time.

Big calls on Mind Meedicine that's forsure.
And they are ranked #1 in customer satisfaction.

What does that tell you?  The "quality" metrics being used by auto publications are a \*cheap proxy\* for build quality, something they can evaluate quickly and without expending many resources.  Thorough evaluation is hard (ideally, it should take years), but spinning a narrative around a few benchmarks is relatively cheap.  And these things end up being of lesser importance to the consumer in the long run.

I was just as annoyed and pissed off about a couple of cosmetic flaws in my Model 3 as anyone else.  I insisted they fix them, and reimburse me for every cost I incurred in the process.  But in the end, I love my car.  Far more than I ever loved the parade of BMWs I owned before.  The driving dynamics and tech are revolutionary.

If I couldn't have a Tesla, I would get a used Honda Accord.  Something bland and utilitarian.  It's hard for me to really appreciate any other car.

I think there's a misunderstanding here, I didn't get into PLTR because it went up. I got into it because I saw some key components that gave me reason to invest. I would have seen those same key components at $10, $15, even $33. Had I known about it sooner, I would have invested sooner, and my profits would be a lot prettier right now, and even more pretty when PLTR eventually moons.
So you think my 1/8 $50 call won't print?

Nio... I was worried... but you fucking did it. I love this fuckin stonk 💎🖐
Final thought for the night.  There is something profoundly humbling knowing that holding through March AND randomly picking stocks pretty much anytime last year was profitable. That means if you lost money in 2020 it is all your fault. Sir this truly is a Casino.

That $600 is like a hidden tax.
I have a sick fascination with tracking bots, spammers, and certain people when they talk about selling naked calls on meme stocks. seen that story play out too many times. 

One recent interesting case is someone who bragged about selling some TSLA Jul 800c for \~40 to "fucking morons here." This was around the time of S&P inclusion news and the "Moar Theta" boat [posts.](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/jyj0c2/moar_theta_this_must_be_the_guy_who_all_you/)

Hope he adjusted the trade or didn't sell too many because he never saw one profitable day afterward and would have already been at 100%+ loss in half a month with many months to go. 

One more correlated price run and IV expansion in the next few months will trash him.
Who is that?
This is the way
How many here are regularly using psychedelics? I am 100% sure this shit makes me smarter and has changed my life for the better. I can't bring myself to get depressed anymore after realizing how useless a feeling it is. LSD changed my life. Ketamine too. I miss being able to take some paper and go to a float tank place and fucking trance out. I used to trade the owner of the float place some weed and paper and he would let me and my boys come in after he closed shop and we'd all eat some and be there til 3-4 in the morning. We'd start fucking talking freemasonry and aliens and evolution and then go back to basics like business and broads.

I ran the numbers on how much money he was making off the float tanks and it seemed pretty good if you could keep it at least 50%-75% booked. **Anybody got some psychedelic investments?** I think the field is likely to have exponential growth going into the future and want to build a position betting on that. Barrier to entry on making the drugs/growing drugs is low, but there's gotta be a company like GRWG that will capitalize on something fundamental like grow equipment. 

With psychedelics I think VR is actually going to be the tech, along with some companies that offer catered curated experiences.

He's missing the key point of the stimulus.  You print USD and dilute the poors, so that the money goes to assets and the rich.  Then you give the poors $600 so they can go buy a bunch of Chick-Fil-A.  Which is soon to be acquired by PSTH.

+65% for the year. By far the best year I've ever had. Was up another near 10% but got clobbered the last two weeks on Palantir, Cloudflare and Corsair. I'm happy with my positions but it's gonna take some nice action on all three to get back to where I was. In the meantime, selling covered calls and collecting bucks. 

Anyone that didn't invest this year missed out. This is the kind of year dreams are made of. I didn't even do *that* well compared to some people on here who played riskier shit.

Government deals? That’s not an exclusive club. They’re worth 60X **revenue**. The scenario where this valuation pays off is an edge case.

Jack Ma's disappearance and what's happening to BABA is eerily similar to what happened to Anbang Insurance a few years ago. Anbang was a huge Chinese company with more than US$300 billion in assets and 30,000 employees at one point.  Some of you might know them as the company that acquired the Waldorf Astoria New York hotel from Blackstone for nearly US$2 billion in 2014. In 2017, the Chinese government decided that the company was "taking on too much risks" and decided to go after them. Anbang's Chairman [suddenly disappeared in June 2017](https://youtu.be/gtitzuo5-LE) and was found later to have been detained by Chinese government authorities.  He later pled guilty to "fraud and embezzlement charges" and was sentenced to 18 years in prison. The Chinese government then completely took over the company. 


Many Westerners make the mistake that doing business in Asia is the same as doing business in the West because Asia is mostly "capitalist" when it comes to their economy.  That's a bad assumption.  First, the media in most of Asia is controlled by the government.. so free press information is non-existent and western media are hesitant to challenge it for fear that they will be kicked out of those markets.  Second, in the Chinese government's view, everything is theirs to begin with and people like Ma are hired to help.  There is nothing special about capitalism in their view.  Third, there are no checks and balances in their laws - i.e., people who create the laws are the people who enforce it.  Plus the laws are purposely written to be incredibly vague, so the government will interpret them to their benefit as they see fit.
Thanks for the heads up bro

Sir this is a casino
Yes it does. We have no idea how much the Fed is really printing (both actual bills and digitally). There is **one** oversight committee. Do you really believe this committee will shed light on how much was actually printed? That would destroy the USD, far worse than what it's at now. For the record - I am not a conspiracy theorist. I despise them. However, in this specific regard, the facts stand. Every country can print what they'd like. Who's going to verify and at a time like this, why would they? Ultimately, only verification will have an impact on a currency. And do you trust these committes to verify publicly if it means the effective end of their currencies?

The Fed prints whatever is necessary (and more) to keep the economy in tact. "Whatever is necessary" is what's shown to the general public. The "more" is what keeps the economy (read: corporate/capital markets) in tact.

Eh started at the end of 2017, trust me I got wrecked in 2018’s downtrend. I’ve gone through many boomer companies and done years of analysis including the dot com bubble and it’s repercussions (just for example). I have strategic game plans ready for a bear market too. Close to half the money I make is from shorting stocks so you assuming I’m profitable due to a bull market is a fallacy. Do I think it’ll be this sustainable for the rest of my life? Absolutely not. Do I know I’ll bust my ass and find a way to learn and make it work. Absolutely. It’s easy to hate from the sidelines, just remember you’ll always be on the sidelines.

Yes my dude, but you would have to be a special kind of retard to buy from wish more than once. Recurring sales are probably low, and  I am assuming that their profit margin is so high due to them jacking up their prices for wealthier countries.

It's all a big scam,  they lower targets when stock is low,  increase targets when stocks are high. Look at the absolute bullshit of TSLA targets over the past 2 years.  Going from 50 to 600+ when the growth rate has been fairly flat the whole time... 70 IQ.

"China does not have a systemic financial risk problem," Ma said at the Bund Summit. "Chinese finance basically does not carry risk; rather, the risk comes from lacking a system.”

The Fed 'printing money' is just a simplistic statement that describes a more complex process that creates 'reserves that sit in bank vaults' that ultimately depress the interest rate - https://preview.redd.it/gc1uehxq5qv51.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=c247dcf0587444893384c00da32371078eb7242a

It doesn't mean that the Fed is literally sending millions of fresh dollar bills out into the market that can pay Norma who works at the DMV.

I’m afraid to click the link after you said that
Depends on momentum and what I hear in the earnings call. Even with 100% year over year growth for 2021, which I expect to hear as guidance, TSLA will still have a PE over 500 at it's current share price at the end of 2021- that should tell you what to expect. This will be one of those situations in which TSLA posts great earnings and drops for "no reason". Also, all the other auto manufacturers will be releasing their EV lines late 2021 and into 2022, so competition increases, which increases TSLA's dependence on their need to develop their AI and green energy markets. Keep in mind, TSLA still didn't have a positive EPS in q3 from car sales alone, they needed the sale of $397M in regulatory tax credits in q3 to post their $313M positive earnings. Not being able to get into the black on the sale of 500K vehicles at a ~$50K average sale price without the sale of over $1B in regulatory tax credits is worrisome. They are already cutting prices in the Chinese market to compete with NIO, which is good for the number of cars sold, but not good if selling cars can't keep them afloat.
Whaaat!!! HOW?!  
Would love to learn. Congratulations.

A lot of people on this sub will say stupid things in response to this, but honestly thank you for this post. You could potentially save people their asses.
I’d stay away from BABA. This is not a dip you wanna buy when Jack Ma managed to piss off the real Winnie bear 🐻.

As long as the Fed rate stays near zero,  people have to chase low-risk yield outside of bonds and such. REITs are looking much less safe than usual especially with eviction moratoriums and millions of renters months behind. 

SPACs have a floor of 10 for the most part. Hit the lottery and that might turn to 15 or 20. Average gain,  should get to 11-13 pretty easily with a merger announced,  and just rinse repeat.

Aight so, here's my DD. I get that the Stonk is going up. Technicals are good for gme in the short run. I believe the Microsoft partnerships and lord Cohen giving us the opportunity is only gonna make the Stonk go up probably to about 35.

However in 6months to a year. They need to change a lot of shit. Especially to make it more related with esports, build a community, have tournaments, and do something more then just brick and mortar. Possibly a subscription service to really back it up. There not doing Jackshit rn. The new generation of kids are also not gonna give a fck. They wanna buy stuff online. They just buy there games from steam, the PS store, etc. 

Yes we including me likes to go to GameStop to buy stuff. But in the long-run it's not gonna be viable. It's a trebd right now. And news and hype are keeping it going up. But eventually it will fall. 

Not gonna buy puts. And still gonna buy calls. I'm a bull in the short but a bear in the long

Teach me.  I'm good with money, but terrible at trading.  I'm 8 months in, and it'll be a long time until I come close to breaking even.  I try to only limit 20 percent of my portfolio to options, and yet, over this epic bull run much more often than not, I got the horns.  Am I missing a chromosome, how long until you became consistent?  I think I have finally stopped losing money consistently, so it's a start, but it has been absolutely exhausting trying to keep up.
the thing is u have institutions fomoing right now
Thanks for trying and better luck next time. Gotta give credit for trying cause even I'm too lazy for that

Based on you saying that, I can 100% tell you don't know what you're talking about, in regards to "national security" and "substance."

It turns out companies that actually deal with national security, and various levels of classification, know how to put together an unclassified brief to advertise a dumbed down version for retard eyes to check out.

Except ANT going bankrupt is basically priced in at this point. The shares were trading in the 300s not to long ago. Like the post said the companies numbers look great and unless the government decides to break up BABA the latest drop seems like an overreaction.

it's about the mentality that it creates. if you believe that you can make your own luck then it can provide more motivation.
But he has nothing to do with the day to day operations of BABA. BABA going to late 200’s at the end of the month once earnings comes out
This. 

But I think January 11th with the conference and the possibility of the holiday earnings. That may be a catalyst just on the amount of information all at once. Combine that with the growing interest on WSB... it could trigger something, or at least move up Cohen’s schedule where his moves trigger something.

Lost 10k my sophomore year of college day trading and almost quit trading because I was so discouraged. It was my next semesters tuition. Kept learning and practicing pretending mentally to go into a trade at the price I would buy and sell while charting. I graduated college in august and started building up my account. Now I make that 10K consistently every 2 weeks. Moral of the story: don’t give up cuz shit sucks, push through and learn from your mistakes. Everything is a learning curve and persistence is all that’s needed. Or you know YOLO on weeklies cuz fuck the work might as well gamble.
Almost like... it’s a rigged unregulated market?

Up .31%. Yes, "POINT 31%." Still ecstatic.

Got caught long at the crash. Mistimed my puts, lost more. Late to Tanker Gang, lost more. 

Clawed my way back slowly with swings, made a little on Tanker Gang II. Mostly cash all year so I was taking positions that were too small. After a second crash I gained $80K in 6 weeks. Finished up a couple grand for the year from that hole, and completely relieved.

I learned to play big early when you feel right, and only FOMO tiny amounts late. If your FOMO loses, no biggie; if it wins, you get a little emotional high.

Wanna see a magic trick?

I can make a platinum award apear.
I see nothing that shows steady contraction for months. I only see a drop in the week from Dec 02 to Dec 09, and it rose again the following week.

>You say this as if QE has ever done anything to fight disinflationary pressures.

First of all, once again, QE is child’s play in comparison to what the fed did in response to covid and is clearly willing to continue doing.

Second of all, yes, QE did have an impact on markets and you are delusional to think not. QE just didn’t translate into real economic growth, it translated to rising asset prices. Also evidenced by Japan’s asset bubble funny you mention that.

>QE has literally NEVER resulted in inflation

And I have repeatedly agreed with this.

Edit: I respect your lack of faith in the fed though.

I thought the same as you for years, and sat on cash for years, and bought puts in March thinking the fed wouldn’t be able to keep deflation in check. I think it’s become evident they can basically do whatever they want to keep markets afloat.

Unfortunate you’re caught up in your semantics to see it.

I bought two 1/15 M🅰️RA $14c  when it was $12.80 on December 30. Hoping those absolutely moon Monday.
Anyone else remember Zyzz?
It’s too risky now as it’s on a warpath with CCP. Sure, BABA is the roaring lion in the East but at the end of the day, CCP is the Ringmaster. 

I’ve made some profits trading BABA and actually dodged a bullet - my buy order didn’t go through due to daylight savings when Ant IPO was blocked. 

Maybe after the pissing contest blows over.
So I was talking to a girl and she had a habit of never wanting to take responsibility when she was wrong about something, or if she was wrong you were also wrong. And that shit is dumb. Dropped her faster then a paper handed bear holding a spy put on a green dildo opened Monday. Moral of the story, don't put up with a girl's shity personally because you are lonely....get a anime girl body pillow instead .

What happened to homie?
China is extremely capitalist. It’s arguably more state-capitalist (i.e. a state directed capitalist economy) than communist for a lot of reasons I will not spend time writing on. The major difference between Chinese capitalism and American capitalism is that the CCP essentially has control and influence over corporations. This is why the CCP can force incredibly wealthy and powerful companies to bend over backwards and force Jack Ma to report for political remediation. Imagine the US doing that to Bezos and Amazon. It wouldn’t happen, because Amazon would bribe the congressmen they need. China is communist only in name at this point. When people say China is communist, they don’t misunderstand the difference and mean to say that China is authoritarian. It’s important to keep in mind how capitalist China is, and how their particular brand of capitalism will influence their decision-making (and thus affect your plays).

Toyota has been growing. They sold close to 9 million vehicles this year and have less than 1/2 Tesla's market cap. What does Tesla have to do to sustain enough growth to justify their share price? What do other automakers etc. need to fail to do? I believe they could absolutely be a dominant company someday, but its bizarre that its priced now like that's a sure thing.

Last one from me as I was watching one of my favorite youtubers, Graham Stephen: https://youtu.be/1gVZcsJRK1w?t=497

The entire video is great in explaining a long term investing/saving mindset, but I thought of our conversation when watching the part around 8:20 onwards. Give it a watch - you won't regret it!
When Wish sells stuff like [this](https://www.wish.com/product/5e1c7c12973a96562874eea3?from_ad=goog_shopping&_display_country_code=CA&_force_currency_code=CAD&pid=googleadwords_int&c=%7BcampaignId%7D&ad_cid=5e1c7c12973a96562874eea3&ad_cc=CA&ad_curr=CAD&ad_price=5.00&campaign_id=1643927883&exclude_install=true&gclid=Cj0KCQiA0MD_BRCTARIsADXoopa2HwuO-4QROm8137VKUScfzusd6pS15nTOdO3wnMremOpW1Wqi-EUaAo2DEALw_wcB&hide_login_modal=true&share=mobileweb), clearly it’s undervalued no matter what the price is.
It's not that it won't be beneficial, but that is a sign that all is not well. Closing 20% of your stores is never a good thing. Yes it's better to close them than to continue to keep them open and losing money, but the fact that they must be closed at all is not good.

That's not really true. I get what you're saying but it's a bad comparison. Way more companies were able to get a return from investing in a computer than the return that companies would get buying a robot dog. 

It's not like computers were useless before the internet was made.

This is discounting for the FED backstoping bond yields so you have a cyclical risk on move for 2021. And in that scenario when rates stay near 0 and FED holds policy as is, I think that's actually a fair valuation. We have a few monte carlos which puts the infinity price forecast on a conservative 25th percentile. And ofc the devaluation of the dollar reay nails the head on this thesis.

No offense, but are you crazy?? Charges will undoubtedly be brought against Trevor at some point this year. Can you imagine what that will do to the stock price

Everything TSLA does is slipshod and shady yet people think somehow they'll deliver everytime and take papa Elon's word for shit.  Fucking dumb as shit, but I ain't gonna get in the ring with a fully embued retard.
I can see that given I’m a contractor, engineer, teacher, philanthropist with my own fitness studio that has recently (last 6month) decided none of it was worth it since I’ve made more on dipshit stock moves than I have in 12 years.

The usual... bureaucratic state... hired 3X too many bureaucrats, no clean streets or real work, just higher taxes, rich dont care, poor don’t care, place goes to shit.  

Give you an historic example:  GH bridge completed in 1930’s in a year or so, $35 mill.   

Needs a maintenance crew of course of 16 people for constant round-the-clock maintenance.  Old timey manual painting, labor intensive.

But now, with modern equipment and automation technology?  guess how many crew it requires?

75 !!!!!

And that 35 million price tag has been paid over many times over but do they decrease the toll? No they’ve increased it 20X

Lol look at the time frame on the chart you shared my dude. Read the weekly H8 data.  Bank credit has been contracting steadily for months.... [https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h8/current/default.htm)

>  
>  
>As soon as it appears deflation is actually setting in, which we'll all know here via a stock market correction, the Fed will ramp up the printing press again

You say this as if QE has ever done anything to fight disinflationary pressures.  QE has literally NEVER resulted in inflation, yet you and everyone else keep believing it will this time around.  It's genuinely absurd how u can just ignore data for over a decade (longer if you consider Japan's QE) and continue believing a lie that the fed wants you to believe.

Everyone was like ehhh they bought PLTR to balance blablabla... oh well they didn’t have to or just sell all of it or they could have just bought C3.AI, SNOW, any Palantir’s AI competitor. Glad y’all sold cause they will finally let it go up.

Because stocks move on news so if there's no news and they want it to move they do an upgrade or downgrade and make the news themselves. You ever notice that those articles only ever come from some sketch ass outlet where just about the only thing youll ever read from that site is "oh analyst jack mehoff downgraded pton to underweight omg"

Boss wants price to go down so he can buy at a cheaper price. Analyst, get out while you still can! This company will go bankrupt soon! 

I recall some analysts saying TSLA was going under as it dropped below 300, then 200 pre-split before going back up and making history.
Wait, you're serious....

However, Tesla is also very important in China's goal to reduce pollution in their cities and drive the EV revolution.

Just remember, they buys shares and play the long game. They sat on TSLA for many years waiting for this run, and they will do the same for PLTR. Your weeklies will still prob make you broke.
I'm sorry is that a real thing
Nothing to see here folks. It's literally just a supply chain software nicely packaged together. Normally companies use separate systems because of legacy or blah blah blah. The only thing you need to know is that it's' not "revolutionary". It's good but no PLTR.

As for the forecast capabilities you are freaking joking? IT'S SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT. All they literally do is forecast shit. Nerds have been doing it before computers were invented. Give me 2 months, access to their backend data bases and about three fifty and I can build you something similar.

The selling point here is that they'll manage the software instead of you having to hire a bunch of retards like me to maintain it. Since it's SAAS they can spread the cost out to every customer so it's cheaper to use them than run your own custom solution. 100 companies need 1 team of coding monkeys. 1 company needs 1 team of coding monkeys.

TLDR: It's not that bad but don't believe the AI/Prediction thing. It's literally shit easy. Selling point here is low maintenance, easy to use, and scale(which makes the cost lower than running your own). This will not outgrow Palantir. If you buy this you belong in /investing.
I literally have not been able to make it a month without getting gilded in this shithole.  When Reddit goes public WSB should get 49% for all the fucking awards thrown out here.

This is a play stock for me. I’m balls deep in AMD stock and just entered large position in ARKG. I see value in their product but this valuation doesn’t make any sense. I think insiders will dump shares after lockup’s over.
Bro honestly, I 100% believe stocks only go up but something is fucked when it comes to TSLA and I won’t be there when it pops. I’m buying a TESLA M3P so at least I’m helping the cause
ye I know they seem very nice, but can they ramp up their productions fast enough as well tho? it won't be easy. I think they'll all survive, but Tesla will definitely have an edge by 2030
This ticker so silly, it makes part of my brain say “well all these people are shorting so I could just sell some in the morning and try to get back in at around 20” while simultaneously on the other side of my head I’m diving into scroodge mcducks pool if I just hold and on and on

I totally buy that. I refuse to believe RC is reacting. I think he is playing 3D chess with all his moves planned. He has contingencies planned. He may adjust scheduling due to events, but I don’t believe he’s making this up as he goes. I also don’t necessarily believe RC and Sherman are enemies. May not be friends, but their interests have plenty of overlap. Melvin is a common enemy.

You can buy options at night and on weekends? This game is rigged
> Okay I get what your saying but its literally impossible for them to make and sell that many even by 2030.  

I mean I get your point, but this is Musk tho. Like, I thought the iPhones were stupid and no one would pay for such overpriced garbage right? but then even the broke rather buy iPhones than eat and pay their bills...

I'm just saying you could be surprised...

I agree that Toyota will be an interesting competitor, but crushing tesla at this point just seems too far off.

Sure, Toyota's cars are of great quality, but in terms of understanding the technology and especially marketing well they do lack a front there. Honestly I'd be much more worried about Apple as their brand power is very strong as well and well their capabilities for innovation is quite impressive.

I think autonomous driving will make a huge difference. I don't think Toyota will be able to compete on that front unless they acquire some startups,, but apple tho sure can.

Also, the quality issue well it can get fixed over time. and the price point, well they've already lowered it so much, they could come up with a 25k sedan at some point...

I don't think Toyota will die either, but I don't think there's any chance for Toyota to crush Tesla at this point. Innovators will out pace the followers. Apple became great only because of Jobs...
OMG :D

No help,

How to avoid the pump: stop buying at the fucking peak. If the Dd looks pretty, it’s probably because the other person has a better education than you and will make the educated decision to sell while you are buying. Take MT for example. The first day it got posted is the first day it flat lined. Theta has been killing everyone, so anyone selling covered calls has been slaying it(likely the original poster).         

How to buy the dip: literally buy it when it is streaking down, but based around previous support and resistance lines. Look for consolidation points as buy in areas, and don’t sell when it breaks resistance because fake outs are real and can be extremely volatile going the other way.
Damn it. You crazy son of a bitch, I’m in.

Okay I get what your saying but its literally impossible for them to make and sell that many even by 2030. Their biggest problems will be supply chains, competition (huge competitors), and price point. They are too expensive of a car for what it is. Simply put, they won’t be able to sell that many cars because the car only gets bought by a certain demographic ....aka people with a good amount of money. There is only so much room to grow and big manufacturers won’t be willing to just step aside and give up market share to an inferior company. Toyota and honda will crush them. Just wait until they actually decide to make a real electric car. Not some car that the door handle doesn’t work on for $70k

Yes, it's too late for the MTM election to take effect for this year's filing. It has to be made in a timely manner (by the unextended due date) the prior year, and, in legal cases challenging that (e.g.), there are almost no exceptions. The smallest exception occurred this year since the unextended tax day was delayed to July 15.

But beware(!) NEVER trust tax advice/info you see here, including mine.

After every big run TSLA dips & has a consolidation period where it trades flat for a while, eating up theta. Buying leaps is one thing, but tons of people here have lost money on TSLA weeklies. 

Especially FDs where the stock does go up, but IV starts cooling off so you still lose money.

Yes, but most people didn't have or needed one. The internet didn't really exist either. It's kind of like buying the Boston Dynamics robot today.
It’s actually explained by the demand in ARKW itself, not because they made any bulk purchases of PLTR, so this argument is pretty weak. There’s a list of trades and there’s a link that literally says “why does the share count go up even if no trades are reported”. Also, you can subscribe to ARK’s trades and see what’s bought on a daily basis.

You're basically implying that because a group of extremists participated in these acts, then that **all** Uyghurs were involved in terrorism attacking China? That's the same as saying all muslims were involved in the 9-11 attack. So should all muslims be persecuted for the acts of a few extremists? This is so ridiculous.

You also realize that you're referencing a North American "whitewashed" source? Note how it still explains the truth of what happened in these situations? Not "whitewashed" to support an American agenda? Can the same be said of "facts" released by the ccp?

Man, your point makes no sense. If money wasnt created monetary supply would remain constant and dollar would have not lost 99% of its purchasing power since the 1970s. As simple as that. 


Us treasury creates debt which Fed buys with new fresh money. You just have to see this video:[ money printing](https://youtu.be/DUrlNHTxuJM)

Stop messing with useless semantics and pretending to be a monetary policy guru because you saw some youtube videos which clearly you misunderstood.

Edit: in fact March 2020 crash was a liquidity event crash. Not enough dollars in the market due to derivatives and shadow banking system. I thought this was the one event that would make the whole financial system implode. 

That was why I was a gay bear, and that was the reason 2 trillion of usd were injected into the system, so that it can work until a new monetary system comes to replace the us dollar as the world’s reserve currency.

Just search Triffins dilemma and you will understand why monetary supply will keep expanding as long as US dollar is the worlds reserve currency

The media sometimes just needs things to talk about. At a very high level PLTR does have exposure to oil and gas industry but one needs to ask if Oil revenue is falling is PLTR the first in line to get the axe? It's usually long term projects that don't have any ROI in the next 12 months that gets the cut. Now one could argue that companies that don't use PLTR may pause any new spending on partnerships etc. That would be a fair statement.  

That being said with the Vaccine out and the economy expected to open up by summer, think this would be a buying opportunity. Also remember PLTR is Industry agnostic. Oil Industry down? no problem contracts related to virus distribution are booming. oh cold war heating up? no problem defense contracts may boom. PLTR consultant is now Bidens new National Security Advisor. you dont think she is going to expand US spending with PLTR in the next 4 years?

A large drink has been 1 dollar since 1995
forward PE is 185, basically there would be only about max 5 years priced in. It's a lot but not as much as you make it to be.

Also, if you just think about it. If they produce 20m vehicles in 2030. Average revenue per vehicle of 40k and let's say margin of 26% and then use a PE ratio of 15. You'd already get 3 trillion dollars of a valuation.

Now, they don't really need to sell 20m vehicles by 2030. With robotaxis, revenues could be even higher.

Maybe you think it's too insane and it's impossible. Well, first consider, is it possible that they produce 20 million cars by 2030? I think it is yes. 

Can they sell that many? well that depends on them, however, the one person I wouldn't bet against on this sort of things would probably be Musk. You just know he'll find a way to make it happen.

Unless there is some sort of big news catalyst I’d say 2 months at the minimum. Jan/Feb are also kind of shit months for the market. If Father Powell doesn’t unleash the money printer I’d say even longer

Bottom of the channel is 14, it'll probably touch and bounce back. Might be stuck around 14.

But it breaks below 14, you're fucked. Not as likely but breakouts above the top of channel or breakdowns below and it's going parabolic or crashing respectively.

Doesn't always work that way with legit companies, but with penny stocks like GME the patterns typically hold more often.

Guys I’m not gonna make it to market open.... go on without me😭

*ejaculates*
I talked with Janet Yellen outside of a BB&T once about dirt.   This is what she told me.   

&#x200B;

"The funny thing is, depending on the brand of dirt, there *can* be a big difference- though that’s probably not always reflected in the price. Try to study the ingredients list, and see what all is there. Peat moss, composted bark (both coarse and fine), perlite, vermiculite, dairy compost, several different types of fertilizers (some of which are extended release and really cool), dolomitic lime, and occasionally other random additives to get desired effects can all go into it. Also, if you ever see styrofoam bits in your soil, that’s a heads up it’s cheap crap. I should stress here, good companies don’t use styrofoam, they use perlite instead, which, while it looks roughly the same- white bits in the soil; and it does the same job- it, according to her sources, helps break up/aerate the soil, perlite doesn’t have the same environment impact, since perlite is basically volcanic rock "

&#x200B;

Turns out she loved getting her hands dirty .
You're right, looks like I was the dumbass here. I was thinking of a cash secured put, my bad.

TSLA will just invent and innovate new things and patent more IP. That's why China can never truly win in a technological race, they are always waiting behind the scenes to steal other's work rather than come up with their own. They're always going to be at least a step behind if not more.

**Valuable post! Everyone please read OP's post carefully. Even if this doesn't apply to you this year, it might help you in future years.**

Talk to your accountant now. Or check from your account, you can estimate how much you made by trading stocks in 2020. If you owe IRS money for 2020, write a big check to them now. Don't use that money to play short term fire. You may lose them all yet still have to pay the IRS. This happened to a lot of people in the past.

>We're on the brink of a massive deflationary spiral, NOT inflation.

I never argued we're on the brink of inflation.

We pretty much entered a strongly deflationary period in March, and then the Fed stepped in flushing the market with cash. We are not in a deflationary period today mainly because of the Fed's actions, though sure I'd agree it's possible for deflation to set in again.

As soon as it appears deflation is actually setting in, which we'll all know here via a stock market correction, the Fed will ramp up the printing press again -- and a correction would only come in the event the Fed doesn't ramp it up again proactively and avoids it entirely, which seems plausible to me. And stocks will go up again.

Here are other metrics that support the fact that yield chasers are being incentivized to chase:

- [Falling high yield rate](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLH0A0HYM2EY)
- [Rising margin at broker dealers](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL663067003Q)

Fair enough so they do have some potential customers. 

I do remain doubtful, adding an extra motor and a battery pack makes the truck heavier. Fuel savings have to pay them both off in addition to compensating the added weight. Here's the kicker, one of the measures of a good driver is to see how long their brake pads last.  We're trained to avoid using the brakes, using the brakes outside of stop signs and emergencies is inefficient driving.

Be careful about that Chris Bloomstran guy. He doesn't know what he is talking about. I don't argue with him because I don't like to educate bears. 

Those who already invested in TSLA years ago, probably will gain another 10 fold by just sitting. 

Those who have never invested in TSLA, don't jump all-in now because of FOMO. Follow sound investment rules. Proper allocation in good companies. I think Tesla is one of the good companies.

Those who have been shorting or plan to short, nobody can help you. You are on your own. Bears have never been right on Tesla in the past 10 years. Chances are they will be wrong in the next 10 years.

At one point I was down 30% for the year. This was due to being a gay bear outside of March. I will not be a gay bear no longer and buy puts on SPY. 

Since that low point, I have clawed back to less than 20% down with bullish positions in AAPL, PLUG and FCEL. Currently doing Poor Man Covered call on FCEL, 100 shares of Plug, and looking to get into AAPL leaps later this month.

Current price is 5x their Feb run-rate. YTD Sep non COVID sales were $180M... 400M doses are contracted thru June, should net $6-7B. So, if sales are 40x... Maybe their newfound earnings and name recognition can propel some opportunities, acquisitions, increased R&D... We'll see, I grabbed 100 shares Thursday at 103, like that price point better than 178. Will cost in some more if the drop continues, should be at least some bounce by next earnings.

Appreciate you posting here, I'm too retarded to make my own graphs. I'm even more bullish as all the gay bear postings here are all backwards looking. The fact that they don't consider that the price itself is at an all time low is insane. The revenue that they're making in the absolute worst case scenario, 7 year decline due to end of console cycle + pandemic shut down of their stores yet still positive FCF and priced for bankruptcy with the biggest short interest % in the entire market.

This stock reminds me of cigarettes stocks, years ago everyone was smoking left n right, now not anymore. Everyone thought they were going to go out of business yet they pivoted and are still making insane profits despite this. Everyone screaming digital only no one going to gamestop never bothered to even look at the gaming subreddit to see how people are still going there for their gaming fixes.

Just look at posts a few months back, people said 20$ was impossible, they're wrong there and they're going to keep screaming 0 when this is sitting at 60$ with the SI still at +100%.

And no one is talking about it at all after desperately pumping not only this stock but entire sector for what seems like weeks... even days... Even!

The squeeze started closer to 6.

It's trading in a channel \*currently\*, floor is 14 ceiling is around 22. If it breaks the channel down, these NPCs will get wiped because there's really no long-term support, no value that people will 100% for sure buy the dip at until you get to 4.

There were rumors of negotiations which are failing because the selling institutions cannot really pass up the opportunity to be part of the squeeze. 

Extra 10% is pittance.

I am more worried about them silently covering in the dark pools and not moving the price much.

Your thesis is assuming that the accounting numbers from BABA are real and I think we can all agree that they are most likely inaccurate and if we want to test this look no further than Luckin Coffee.

Still new to options and tryna understand some things. How does the guy that made 1 mil from 400$ worth of TSLA options cash out? Does he exercise the contract and buy the TSLA shares at the cheaper price and then sell them for the profit, or does he just sell the options contracts? If he does sell them, what happens if the purchaser decides to exercise the contract, does he have to provide the shares to that guy? Thanks for any help

There's no way it won't get to 200 by 2022. if they keep shorting it like this, this stock will shoot straight to the stars.

Great time to buy warrants because they're announcing the merge date any moment.

I agree but the government couldn't even finish building the nuclear waste storage facility in the southern US due to NIMBY, so that makes it a little difficult.  I can't imagine how long it will take to get one of the new reactors that can reprocess spent fuel built.  China will have 20 before the US gets 1.

It took this board that long to discover the wheel? Buncha retards. Wheel= buy 100 shares, sell covered call with strike higher then cost, if option expires sell it again, if exercised, rebuy 100 shares maybe of a different company if share price mooned in original chosen stock.
No. When the Fed buys treasuries as part of QE, there is an indirect link that causes excess money to flow into financial assets; in other words, there is a causal link that starts with QE and ends with additional money flowing into financial assets than otherwise would. I'll explain this at the end of this comment.

The fed also straight up purchases mortgage backed securities when doing QE, not just treasuries. This is the more obvious link to financial assets, but spelled out even clearer: buying mortgage backed securities on the open market with dollars that didn't exist prior provides support for mortgage backed securities, which makes it easier for banks to create mortgages, which makes it easier for people to buy real estate, which supports the price of real estate. Thus dollars the fed prints out of thin air to purchase MBS puts upward pressure on the price of real estate, [which we have also observed in real terms since QE began](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/QUSR628BIS).

Now, with treasuries. This has a more pronounced effect of lowering interest rates (which purchasing MBS does too so the argument applies, but treasuries have a stronger effect on interest rates in the US as it's considered the risk-free rate, and loans are often priced in terms relative to treasuries). The fed uses dollars printed out of thin air to purchase treasuries on the open market, which provides upward support on the value of treasuries (benefiting the treasury holders, i.e. the banks), and has a downward effect on interest rates. [We have also observed that interest rates have declined since QE began](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10). Lower interest rates incentivizes yield chasers to take out loans and place cash in financial assets, including risky endeavors, like Tesla or junk bonds or subprime auto loans. Or to take out loans and binge on [stock buybacks](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-global-markets-outlook-buybacks-qe/qe-fueled-share-buybacks-may-lose-luster-idUKKCN0T928820151120).

i disagree on the being able to use the door part, its incredibly easy to jam a door and its not always obvious but even a slightly bent body frame would pinch doors shut. but your right about media hype, i still remember how a huge fuss got started up around un intended acceleration with Teslas do to a short seller bringing up 50 reported cases but Tesla had security measures to make that impossible, Toyota had a similar media storm but nothing was ever actually wrong, just drivers who thought they were hitting the brakes.

That's not a very good critique tbh. The benzo thing, yeah sure that's a little ridiculous she'd be withdrawling for months but it's a TV show so you can let that slide. And chess is a tight knit community and she was a USA player going against russians during the cold war...that's a huge rivalry to show USA strength of course they're going to come together to help her. And I don't think it was ever said he was explicitly gay and even if he was implied to be gay he could just be bi. Overall it's a pretty good show, every show has flaws but none of the flaws in the show were enough to take away from the high quality

It just feels different from modern warfare. A lot of people hating on it are use to camping in mw. I think the spawns are typical and it does feel like you die faster, the aiming is different and aim assist is a lot different if you’re in controller. They took out a lot of the mechanics seen in mw, recoil and shooting feels different too but I honestly think it’s a good game. But also I pull gun ships and stuff in the game pretty easily so I might be bias

1 min candles are awesome. Get financials one click away. Can set it up so all the data you need is in one screen. Super customizable. 10 different watch lists mine are like Restaurants, Retail, Autos, etc. can highlight metrics, such as 52 week high or 50 day average volume.

Cons: It's Bank of America. Like once every two months Merrill is down but apparently that's all brokers.

It sounds like you're talking about something like the Walking Dead games where it's a choose your own adventure on rails. 

Try something like the Deus Ex games - they're a more open world and do story well - I'd recommend trying Human Revolution first.  The original Deus Ex is even better, but the graphics quality is pretty low compared to modern games, although you can get some mods that upgrade it a little.  

If you're really adverse to story you can try Just Cause 2 (don't do 3 -- 2 is better, I haven't tried 4), even the story missions in that game are just blowing things up. Bulletstorm is another one that has a story but it's just a framework for you to shoot things with cool guns.

If you want a co-op shooter you can try Killing Floor 2 or Payday 2

And if you want open world mayhem try Saints Row 3 and 4 - I would play 3 first because the upgraded movement in 4 will make 3 feel super slow if you play it first. 

All of those are a little older so I would imagine many or all of them are on sale right now with the Steam holiday sale going on

Ok I have $100,000 I really need. Tell me why I should go all in on whatever weeklies are reporting next week.
he does not, guys like this ignore contradicting evidence to build a case that sounds convincing until unproven by basic information.

when he says "Unit demand for Tesla’s cars is only increasing via continual price cutting", it makes him look foolish when Elon Musk has repeatedly said thats the goal and essential to increasing adoption of electric cars. Tesla does not want to sell 40k cars forever, they want to come out with a 25k car and they can do this because they already have a 21% gross automotive profit margin which is better than most of these "experienced" automakers. emission credits are used to fund the 3 multi billion dollar giga factories currently being built around the world. elon would not announce a 25k car unless they were sure they could make money on it.

It's like shorting the market. Very hard to do and can end up being very expensive (GME to the 🌝).
Capital preservation is not age-dependent. Everyone should hold cash regardless of age because 1) cash itself has option value (think of it as a universal call option with no expiry) and 2) equity price appreciation is not a law of nature. Only ever own stocks if you also own cash and/or insurance (long put options). The former is what I would advise our boy here to do.

Haven't been able to look at a cake the same way for 25 years.  The morning after my sister went to a bachelorette party I woke up at 6am for some Saturday morning toons.  I opened the fridge and immediately slammed the door.  I couldn't make sense of what I saw.  I shook my head, was I in a dream.  I cracked the door open a little and spied a cock as tall as the 2 liter coke bottle standing straight up out of the center of a cake.  Something like "to a life full of hap-penis" written on it...a corner of the cake eaten.

So many feelings that morning: fear, curiosity, anger, ...betrayal

That thing was made of sugar (don't ask) with detailed bulging alien veins. This was before we had internet and I hadn't seen anything like that before.  I was so embarrassed to mention this to my parents I just hid in my bedroom playing nintendo.

It still haunts me and every bday since, when the whole family is staring at me to blow the candles out, I got that fake smile on and am picturing that two foot dick sticking out of the cake.

She gets congratulated by her favorite chess player for beating him, he even calls her the best chess player ever, all her jilted lovers not only help her out but come together in a tunnel buddy sleepover, the gay guy she liked not only shows up but is now straight and into her, she becomes the world champion with an over the top bit from the current one.  She took em all and the ending is a fucking fever dream.
Better to just replace him and control his replacement. There's at least one guy that looks exactly like him.

I dont know if GME can do what needs to be done, but I do know *something* needs to be done. The gaming industry right now is not healthy or customer friendly -- perfect for Cohen to step in. How much GME will actually be able to accomplish, thats a crapshoot; but there is room for it.

How people feel about Tesla is how I feel about corsair. 🚀🚀🚀

I mean if say a waymo car can't detect a black person as easily as a white person and a black person gets hit that's going to justify the extra investment in dealing with "racial bias" of ai sensors. In other areas it's tough to find a balance sometimes for sure though. SJW and cancel culture folks are over the top these days.
I put my money on RC, he is the key.  I cannot imagine RC investing the amount of effort and money into gme if he has not already planned out everything and is tactically making his every move.  WeWantCohen

It seems like they’re trying to turn in to an all in one digital sports casino where you watch, bet, and rage when you lose your bets. Could be bullish, or I could be an idiot

Let me do some research on that. I think implied volatility is directly linked to premiums so might as well just show the most expensive options.
I would be glad to give you more depth on why I am bullish these companies soon (on vacation but no less happy to provide confirmation bias soon when I get back) In the meantime I will tell you simply that if everything you say can be found in a simple stock screener it *is* shitty DD. Don’t be ashamed it is what this sub is all about and we both belong here. Personally I consider the metrics you mentioned to be a reason that one would conduct due diligence, but alone they are simply common knowledge. Common knowledge is not due diligence. Couple with the fact that in your discussions you also failed to convert currencies which is a major oversight and a bad look (though a good look on wsb). Nobody following these tickers for any amount of time would make that mistake.

Don’t get me wrong, I am not big brain; however I still don’t want my prediction to be associated with your DD (it only relates to the topic and ticker). Godspeed I wish you the best as we should both get tendies in the end. 🚀 

P.S. I upvoted the post anyways since $ is $ regardless and we here to get paper

> Sherman himself owns over 1 million shares and has not sold them as far as I know.

No insider has sold a single share in the last 3 month reporting period, not one single share.

All personal finance advice I've every received is to sell company shares as soon as possible, and diversify away so your fate isn't tied to your employment, the fact that nobody, and board members are shareholders, the fact that nobody is doing this is bullish.
This is really good OP.  Can I request one more feature? Can you also add  "High IV Option"

Waiting for Ivanhoe Capital Acquisition to become tradable. They filed for IPO in December, it's a SPAC focusing on clean energy. IPO looking to raise $200m by offering 20m units at $10. No dates yet but keep an eye out for it.
Yes, the people above don't seem to understand this.
From the outside google seems pretty legit. Ive had a pixel 2 for a while now and think it's probably one of the best phones out there. Squeeze it and google assistant is very accurate i use it all the time. My wife got a samsung s9 from at&t and we both laugh how bad her 'bixby' assistant is and she has all this at&t bloatware. So from the outside there are people like me who like google products. certainly not like apples following but perhaps potential to grow market share. But obviously if you see the inside there are a lot of issues. It's probably fair to say amazon and facebook are going to be more disruptive tech wise though. They definitely seem to push new developments out faster.

IT help desk sort of work is pretty easy, decent pay. Always money in finance - consumer subprime/near prime credit is basically recession-proof. Really I wouldn't worry about the money as long as you enjoy the work.
Assuming you’re ownership make sure you Facebook blast that you are taking extra precautions and shutting down until everyone tests negative, it’s actually solid sympathy press from what I’ve seen

Where in this list of regulations does it say your original claim that "illegal immigrants prevent tourist visas" because this is just a brief about how many immigrants the United States will allow and the various numbers of visas to be given out. Including employment visas. How does this prove your point? 

Don't start that pearl clutching shit with me. My language usage has nothing to do with my education level. You have no idea how dirty the mouths of professors can be. I already am well educated, I want my doctorate so I can be taken seriously in my field. And in my field does not mean you, I could not give a single fuck about your opinion of me or my language. 

And I was not listing my qualifications for you to judge where I lived, just letting you know that you are looking down on the wrong person. 

If anything I'm probably more cultured and experienced than your boomer ass.

Bitch, I’m a retired infantryman. I’ll be the first to tell you 99% of what happens downrange is jerking off in a guard shack. All I got from my 16 years in service was a few injuries, a debilitating need to spit or stand still on my phone every time I step outside, and a medical retirement+CRSC. In other words, all it gave me was to the ability to display real courage on a fuck ton of PLTR calls.
Had my model S since 2012, service was fantastic in the beginning then fell off a cliff these past two years. I’ve purchased 2 non-Teslas since and will buy another one once they get their build quality together. Seeing the new 3s and Ys that came out of Fremont with still dogshit paint is a little sad. I can walk into a Toyota dealer and get a hybrid Corolla that will have a lower TCO and build quality

Hey even fatties gotta get some luv
Most Americans are obese.
no, its because they have different issues they get recalled fore like corroding bolts on the steering wheel. but other companies like Hyundai just recalled 77,000 kona Ev's over 14 battery fires over the last 2 years, tesla with its fleet of over 1 million cars has never had fire rates this bad and in such spontaneous circumstances. GM also had a recall of 70,000 of its EV's over battery fire risk when fully charged, they dont send over the air updates so they just advised customers not to charge to full.

my jeep has issues with leaking roof too and wet carpets, so do many of the models in different years but their was never a recall for that. or really addressed for half a decade.
Could’ve stopped at girls
Yep, and Exxon for decades publicly denied climate change and its role in it. 

The last sentence is the operative one. Every single client they have is almost guaranteed to have data sharing agreements.

Got it, so you are just here to project your semantics surrounding the term "money printing"

>So if QE is money printing, why isn't there inflation?

I already answered this. [The money has flowed into equity markets](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kp0tcw/you_all_know_the_paradigm/ghvjumu/) (and debt markets). And you continue to dodge any questions about QE's actual, on-the-ground impact on the economy, and instead choose to stick to the comfort of your semantics.

I'm over this.
