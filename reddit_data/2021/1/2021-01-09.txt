No, I don't have to admit that. Trump is just gonna be a regular person in 11 days. Regular people get banned on platforms for saying far less ridiculous things all the time. 

Freedom of speech does not free you from the consequences of your speech. There have been (and continue to be) so many dark years in our country's history where some people didn't even have the freedom to safely EXIST, let alone spout inane hateful babble for evil people to eat up.

The dealers that sell you options are buying/selling stock to hedge the price movement. They achieve a non-directional position and collect premium. Like bookies, they don’t care who wins the game.

Definitely not! It all depends on your portfolio composition.

If this guy can make a mil with math like that how hard can it be amirite?
BA will be down big pre-market on Monday, you can't fill your order until the option market opens, when it does BA will be down significant already, thus to buy a put option when market opens will already be price adjusted so you aren't going to 2-3x a put order at market open.

Anyone else get tipsy and then just fully send it?
Ahh, gotcha. Yeah I want to make a bit of it as income, so I was doing weeklies but my AMD got called away at one point which really sucked tbh, I still need to get a few more to be able to write. I might do bi-weeklies real OTM to just collect some. Even 1-2% profit per month is a bit more, see if I can't reinvest those and continue.
Did you post here to get advice or just to try and justify being a bag holder for Twitter?
No no no you have to suck at least three dicks to be gay

Yeah actually I think I’m wrong https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/how-do-you-calculate-percentage-gain-or-loss-investment/ I think since I was fudging the price paid and price sold I was getting it wrong. I think it is actually 1000% because my principal was lower than 100K.

Yep people have no vision of the future pretty typical
Not correct. He can offset his losses with gains next year. 

Eg. If he lost 54k this year. Takes 3k deduction this year and carries over 51k. Next year he makes 60k. He can offset his losses and pay tax on 9k only. Or say he makes only 40k next year, then he offsets his losses. Balance of 11k losses. Take 3k deduction and carries over 8k to following year.

Basically any profit you make can be offset by carryover losses accumulated in past years.
I’m telling you, I’m usually wrong about this shit so you’re 10/10 making money.
Yeah they will but I would go April
That is one outcome, but another outcome is a sudden overreaction and then return to normal a la March 2020.

The last crash wasn't a bubble popping. It was coronavirus that shut down global trade for the first time since global trade started. Which led to panic.

Mass hysteria sell offs, which resulted in the government stepping in and over delivering by pumping in 4 trillion dollars. Twice what we pumped in last time after the housing crash.

We are now forced to have a bull market.

Then puts?
And that's the issue, it's an if. It's an if based on numerous assumptions, some of which do not hold water in reality. Like musk actually consolidating his companies, or that somehow bringing in enough money or getting him enough credit or investors or whatever magic to fund a colony to Mars.

Like I said, it just skips way too many steps. Deciding the outcome and then finding a way to reach it. These are rather small possibilities, to the point where if it happened it would likely be caused by far more variables than just what you have suggested. I don't think the factors you suggest contribute any where near enough of a degree to accomplish what you say they will.
They share same manufacturer. Nio isn’t the only car company that works with CATL it’s only a matter of time before other car comps use the same tech.

Ah sorry, I was speaking in terms of TSLA but just check the markets to see what options on yours would be worth. Basically figure out a strike price where it's quite unlikely to hit but you're still receiving a premium that's a worthwhile percentage in that timeframe. 1-2% probably not really worth it, 4-5% over a few weeks or a month might be possible depending on volatility.

I've been doing it with NIO, bought shares at $54, wrote a $57.50 Jan29th call for $2.50ish, it's gonna get hit but I still make just over 10% profit overall.

The way it can go 'wrong' is the shares fall and you close the calls but then if you write a new one it's got to be a bit lower to actually get much premium and then the share recovers above that and you get exercised so end up with only a small profit or break even.

Lmao. Idk why McDonald's isn't a meme. Since October (Besides its recent slump) has consistently oscillated in price. Goes up quickly, come down, sometimes too much and then quickly within the day or week is adjusted. 

This past week I yolo'd my last 4k into McDonald's as it was 208 and thats the lowest its been in a minute. NOT GOING BELOW 206. I made about 2k only cause I chickened out. 

But if I had held till Friday I would have trippled my position. Off of fucking McDonald's. 150k worth of cheese burgers holy fuck. 

Whatever, another day another yolo.

Can you tell me why TSLA will be 1,200 besides stonks only go up? Papa Elon, etc?
Go back to reddit
Didn't read all that, but heres some useful info:

China sold about 25m cars in 2020, about 1m (4%) were EVs.  China has a mandate where 20% of cars sold have to be EVs by 2025.  China is projected to sell 30m cars by 2025, about 6m (20%) will be EVs.

That is 6x more EVs than sold this year...within 5 years.

US sold about 400k EVs in 2020.  There is no mandate though maybe Biden admin may push something.

In any event, China is where it is at and will be for EV sales over the next decade.  Their population is more than 2x that of US and Western Europe combined.

Beside 60+ years old demographics who uses Facebook?
Well, some government agencies around me are preparing for a total loss of communications networks in our area.  Twitter also very publicly published the probable date of the next capitol-style protest/ attack when they shut trumps page down.  Silencing and censoring Trump’s social media pages, in my opinion, will draw a significant backlash from the more crazy of his supporters.  Twitter also made the inauguration more of a potential issue when they posted their thoughts on Trump’s inauguration tweet, calling it a ‘safe’ event (aka trump won’t be there so it’s safe to do something to it).  

This thing has spiraled out of control and I don’t think it’s going to be stopped, not within the next 2 weeks anyhow.

Well there are different definitions of retirement. Some people take a stricter view than yours. 

What you describe still sounds like a job. Overseeing a store and managing property are real jobs. Working part time is still a job. Yes you retired from another job but if you're working elsewhere by definition some would say you are no longer retired.

Semantic distinction that doesn't change my statement.
Cant you roll it over to subsequent years though?

I believe in Elon but this is fucking retarded, but there is a shitload of liquidity.

We can't play with monopoly money forever without repercussions. There is still a shitload of money to make though, just make sure you find a bigger sucker to hold the bag...
If so, buy the dip

Hell to the no
It still paid out .18 at it's 52 week low of 17.22 because the Div/Yield is 11%

They didn't change the dividend.

You can get loans based on previous properties you own providing income. I don’t think banks will count the full income of a property you don’t own yet? I think sometimes you can get them to count 50-75% of future income with a good lender?

Do you have different experience personally?

Following their progress closely and I’m a huge fan! What I mean is working colonies with thousands of people. Elon’s timeframe is 3-5 years for a manned mission to Mars if I remember correctly, but Elon is known for his extremely optimistic time estimates. That said, I’m 100% sure we will see a (if not several) manned missions to Mars this decade. But the real value of SpaceX will kick in once businesses see a value in providing services on Mars, which imo will happen after we established a working colony with a few hundred or thousands of people. The space craze will be absolutely crazy and astronomical (lol), but we are still a few years/decades out imo. But the time to place our bets is now/coming soon. The space industry will start growing exponentially with a working Starship. I’m absolutely HYPED for this!
Reading the book Chaos Monkeys now and I feel like everyone here would love it. It's a memoir by a derivatives trader that became the first product manager for Facebook ads and he basically spends the whole book talking shit about everyone on Wall Street and at Facebook including Zuck and everyone else and explains how Facebook changed from a site with status updates to the all seeing eye of spyware.
Every single god damn time I’ve done an option on spy it expires worthless. Even calls and if they’re ITM. Spy is an imposter to me

You do realize that SpaceX and Google are entirely incomparable, right? Google is in a precarious position as basically a monopoly. They can’t just break into anything and everything without lots of possible issues legally. Saying Google hasn’t changed itself or anything else is pretty ignorant as well.

These people who got seriously lucky with their dot com boom companies back in 99-00 think they’re God’s gift to mankind. I think he deserves plenty of respect but he’s not some demigod with special insight into these things.

How much of your holdings are bought on margin? You said you had an aggressive use of margin. RH recently dropped interest from 5% to 2.5% on margin, which has to be a huge windfall for you.

Ya its like people forget how probabilities work.

The higher the probability of a return the lower the gains are and vise versa. Who sets the probabilities? You do based on your research and biases. 

Just retrace all those probabilities you calculated in your head throughout 2019/2020 and see how improbable this price increase was.

Sell OTM covered calls until you get exercised.  You can sell 30 calls per week which is easily 30-50k per week just riding this money.
I was in plug, and while good, I’m all in ICLN now. I’m fearful of the hydrogen bubble - once folks realize it’s not really a play for consumer vehicles, it will drop, and plug will fall hard. Or if tsla falls, it’ll fall, too. ICLN is much safer and cheaper at this point too.

Fcel is literally just riding coattails. No reason to even look at them.
What strike price?
Not sure what you mean but if a software has rest webservices api then it can integrate with any systems in the world.

Salesforce however is partially rest service, and SOAP (which is a fucking retarded outdated way to integrate with other systems).

If you have some technical expertise, try making a Salesforce sandbox, open up postman and try to create an Account record. You will see what I mean.
Because I’m trying to buy calls before all these retards spike the price up. This is obviously ARCT 2.0. Investor overreaction followed by 100% increase in 2 weeks.
Exactly.

Autists 80 dollar leap calls expiring in 2023 are insanely cheap at 20$. Stop listening to these overly analyzed posts.  Nio is the chinese tesla  2 year i'm sure nio will surpass 100 🌕🌕🌕🌕🌕.

Everyone is 40 with wives that have let themselves go
For all the people in here saying "i want to try spreads how do??" know this:

cuck spreads allow you to get in cheaper, do risk management etc, but in return:

1) your gains are capped

2) if you have a smaller account of less buying power you are cucked into holding the short leg of the spread until expiry most of the time. so imagine you have a call debit spread, and the underlying gaps up tomorrow. great! right? nah, your short leg still has a lot of theta left in it, so you often want the underlying to gap up AND STAY THERE until expiry. if you have a lot of capital and no options restrictions, you can simply close the long or short leg of the spread and let the other leg run. So lets say underlying gaps up, you close the long call as it's pretty valuable. Now you have a naked short call position. Underlying crashes back down, suddenly your short calls are worth money again too. i call it the dooble dip
What?! I gotta check that out!
I already have a wife. And she already has a boyfriend.

I haven’t been to China, but don’t know if I would consider 4 months over 5 years extensive. That said if If China goes to even 30% ev that’s a huge increase in one of the biggest markets in the world. If you believe Tesla is fairly valued and think NiO could be  worth half, that’s like 8x from current price. Also you didn’t mention the new nio model as 620 mile range. Partnered with Qualcomm for 5g and Nividia for chips. Enough said.

I own both Nio and Tesla.
I agree with this guy, I even read some of his words, not all of them of course, it on accident I swear and this DD is very tasty. Good use of emoji and everything hmmm.

Grant me thy wisdom oh great ENT. 🙏🌴🤑🌲🙏🥦🙏👍
You turned 100k into 2.6 mil and you’re asking when to get out? The answer is now. Right tf now. Buy some leaps with some of it, and diversify the rest. Unless you’re already loaded and 2.6 mil is peanuts to you, in which case you can fuck right off. Also, don’t ever ask this sub for advice on what to do with $2.6 million. Smdh.

It's best to buy them back at a cheap price if you can just in case there's some black (white?) swan event that makes them recover. Basically removes any risk at that point even if you're giving back say 30% of the the premium.

Genuine question. Who is actually on the spectrum? Are the non spectrum gang more retarded than you? Feel like autism is way less retarded then 90% of us tbh.
If you have time and a steady source of income, one good strategy is to just buy ARK shares every paycheck. ARKK and ARKG in particular. It should pay off in a few years.
Mods have made this sub borderline unbearable, specifically the front page. 70% satirical DD, 30% baby gains & if they don’t find your meme funny they just assume nobody else will so they don’t put it though
And miss out on free money??
I will never recover financially from this.

i quit with 479k on tesla and been selling calls and puts since best move i ever made lmao
ehhh i'm balls deep in NIO right now, but a 70k car isn't middle class. closer to 40-50k
There's a rollercoaster down by the pier where Joe Ted operates it after he comes back from the bar down the road.

The rollercoaster is not huge. Built in 1914, wooden. You can see many screws on the floor. Maybe they were important at some point, maybe not. There's one cart with yellow tape on it that can't be used. I swear, I've seen the tape on different sections of the coaster from time to time. I think the hooligans from the corner like to play pranks on Joe from time to time.

Anyway, you can trust the trendline about as much as you can trust that Joe won't run the coaster off the fucking cliff one night, with you sitting in the broken car.
Dad? Please pick up your phone. We've been calling.

What platform is this
My thoughts exactly, I have quite a bit of my portfolio on Amazon but not close to the 320k for selling premium on shares. I could bang with a 10:1
Some bastard thinks March 2.0 is gonna happen with their SPY 200 poot 😂
Guess it's not going to the moon anytime soon.
HATS OFF TO MOTHERFUCKING HEINICKE
Weeklies have less chance of being hit, but you get less premium. Personally I'd do out of the money weeklies say $50 above current price and if they do hit then it doesn't matter cos you still get exercised at a profit, and if they don't get hit you're still getting thousands of dollars per contract.

Any option decays quicker/exponentially towards the expiry date.
Hop off when it drops back down to $5. Biiiiig tendies

AMZN will not split. Bezos doesn't want poors trading his shit.
China is literally the biggest EV market in the world and 96% of EVs the purchase are produced domestically in China.
I really feel like this is going to happen within the next week or two and then have a nice run out at earnings
Thats what people said to me when plug was at 6.00 and fake internet currency was at 11k. Give your reasoning
Switch back. 

Nvidia is in all the EVs and there is a shift in data centers and big tech as a whole from X86 (intel and amd) to ARM (custom design by company through ARM and made by TSM). 

Nvidia is trying to acquire ARM. if that happens, nvidia will have the entire big tech ecosystem in its hand.
It'll still go down. But maybe good opportunity to buy?
hahaha you win, congrats and fuck you

Not necessarily. Some are running new estimates with new data added and trusting theiur judgment that they will overcome and continue to hold. When I see multiple red flags is when I'll reconsider my position. Those that continue to think that Tesla is still only a car manufacturer isn't making the correct conclusion. Stock will contract before April but will continue upward trend year over year.

I chose to take the riskier trade and bought CLNE solely because it has the word "clean energy" in its name. I've seen sub penny stocks spike just for being in the clean energy business even though they're probably a scam company.

Yes
Fine by me. I'll buy more

Many of the traditional automakers are a bit lagged on EV, but that's also because the EV market is still small.

The big auto companies will have no problem switching over and offering a decent product when EV actually makes up a sizeable portion of the market. Toyota, VW, Kia, GM, etc. aren't being arrogant. They know it's coming

If it drops that far i'm loading up some thiccc-ass LEAPS. I chickened out during that 2-3 day selloff in early September when it went from 500 to 320. The uptick rule came into play and a week later it was already back to 460.
Forgot a 0
OP has owned the stock for years, and in the scenario you're describing, he's paying less taxes because he's holding onto to for the threshold, not because it's dropping in value.

It could be that it drops in value and he net profits more anyway despite the drop, but he's not profiting more *because* of the drop, but because of the tax change due to how long he held the stocks.

You’re right. I was confusing valuation and market cap. Which seem extricably unlinked.
QE = Fed prints money, uses money to buy bonds, government gives away free money through low interest, and subsidies.

In 2008, we did that. $2 Trillion worth. Trickled down economics is real. It just doesn't trickle down to the poor. It trickles down to wealth - stock, real estate, business, gold, and now coins. Once trickle down began, we pumped for 6 years straight. Literally clean 6 year pump.

We pumped double that $4 Trillion from March-June 2020. If Biden passes his Green Deal, that's 6 Trillion we are pumping. Trickle down all over my face. People think 1 Trillion dollar market cap for TSLA is high, but in 5 years, Apple will be 10 Trillion, TSLA will be 3 Trillion.
Just keep it... Tesla got plans man.

THROBBING
I could give you another DD on micro and macroeconomics and explain exactly why we are not even near a crash. For a crash to happen, there would need to be a nuclear bomb to take us all off the map. Then in a billion years when whoever is rebuilding the world, I’d be bullish on steel. Long story, short - when the MULTI-TRILLION US infrastructure drops and the rest of the world follows (and some already have - like China) anyone that is making steel will be printing faster than J-Powell. I haven’t even gotten into the LUCRATIVE nature of government contracts some of these US steel manufacturers will get. Remember in the 80’s when the US government was building and paying $400 for toilet seats?  They will come up with projects and contracts with mills to supply steel. There will be a short supply and US businesses will be looking for import material that will come from the largest steel maker in the world - $MT.  Well positioned in Canada and Mexico. Oh, and I’m just giving you the US situation. Imagine the same around the globe in all developed nations. Not a lot of people realize that government is big business - the biggest when they want to be.  Throw all the global tension in there as well with all major country’s expanding their military’s - do you know how much steel goes into building naval vessels?  Tanks?  This is why there was a section 232 enacted - steel production is necessary for our safety and self-defense.  Lastly, I once sold steel as part of a nuclear reactor project.  Do you know how many truckloads of steel alone went into the building of one nuclear reactor?  1,600 - 24 ton trucks. 40,000T. To build one aircraft carrier?  60,000T.

Twitter sucks. I don’t know how it will do money wise but not good enough to overcome the opportunity cost. People are constantly limiting their personal exposure because it provides nothing and it has pretty real mental cost, and if it becomes a less profitable Facebook with no marketplace integration and no presidential tweets to lend even partial legitimacy to the wholly vapid political posturing taking place there, why would it increase in value? What makes it more appealing?  I’m not saying the bottom will fall out, I just don’t see a reason to be bullish.

Tsla is already valued on par with 2020 Amazon. Another 2X and they'll become the most valuable company by market cap.

You can't price in potential as if it's a foregone conclusion.  A ton of things need to go right just for tesla to be the market leader in EV in 50 years, let alone dominate other new industries.

50 years ago, the most exciting tech company was IBM. I'm sure plenty of people thought they would take over the world by now too.

Workhorse is the only full EV option with Oshkosh being a hybrid truck. Deal should be for about 300 million but it can be split up, not a winner take all. So I'm betting on workhorse to get at least a piece of the deal. Was supposed to be announced last year but got delayed.

And assuming a VERY VERY slight amount of more risk selling 20 1100c would get him 7500 bucks. Where the fuck is your logic here?

Right there with you. 

Here's a tip, though: commit to investing a couple hundreds $ here and there into a index fund based portfolio. For example, I'm 27. I put $600 into my RRSP every month (450 of which is my own money, $150 from my company - if your company offers a match program, take it, it's free money). When I retire in 30 years, with a typical 7% return, it'll be worth close to $1m. People on this sub, 99% of the time, *get lucky*. You don't have to be lucky to be set for retirement.

edit: $600 is a lot of money to some people but it doesn't have to be $600. It could be $100 - anything - just start putting money away. Compounding interest is an amazing thing.

Bullshit.  You want to know how we know you're lying.  Because every investor would have sold sometime in Feb-March when TSLA started dropping.  Nobody would have held thru that.

If you wanted to make this believable, should have pretended like you bought in March

nothing new from nio and the one thing they have wont even be delivered until the end of the year and ONLY in china.  Yes, china is a large market but TSLA is word wide AND ramping up in china.  China could shit all over TSLA in china and that might then cause a bit of a drop in the stock... but pretty much only that.

2020 wasnt a normal year for the stock market, and its better to undersell and overdeliver rather than vice versa. Still outpacing an indices normal year by a good percent and if you buy leaps it’ll be a lot more than 20% (if shes keeps being right that is).

Now that this is low enough in the comment chain:

DISCA isn’t covered highly, but lots of bullish option activity. I knew discovery+ would be a huge catalyst and made around $15k on options this week. I bought lots of feb $40, July 45 and jan 2022 45

Covid wave 2 will get analyst eyes on streaming services, discovery+ is actually a banger. 

If next 2 weeks are macro and the play gets overlooked, earnings end of feb will be the catalyst. 

But I track the Twitter impressions and news for discovery+. There’s still so much upside and the IV is low since people don’t play DISCA cause they simply don’t know about it. 

Only bearish thing is they cover Olympics in some countries, which will likely be cancelled. 

That said, last time Japan pushed back Olympics was April, so the earnings run up is likely safe.
Great comment

i'm in a similar boat, but don't discount that TSLA stock price doesn't make any sense.

If you're a trader, it doesn't make sense to keep money in for the long term. It's more, make your money and cash out.

What we have here is fanatical investing, how can a rational person rationalize that? you can't. You either believed in the company before it was profitable or you didn't, and the ones that believed it would be are sleeping in tendies.

It's weird you keep separating the two like they aren't already combined. Cronos already has a deal to acquire Acreage holdings as soon as federal legalization is approved. Marlboro already has a deal to aquire Cronos once federal leaglization. 

A bet in Cronos is a bet in an existing US player (Acreage) and one of the most dominant smokeable brands ever to exist(Marlboro). In one stock.

Canopy is backed by a little known company called Constellation Brands. I'm not sure why you think there's such a massive barrier of entry for CA players, but constellation already has contacts in the right places across the United States and internationally to distribute large amounts of product. Simply just first round of sales sticking shelves will be eye opening. 

In my opinion you're betting too much on the people prepared to grow the weed rather than betting on the people prepared to most efficiently distribute and brand the weed. It doesn't matter if the weed is grown in Canada, US, or any of the other numerous countries that CA players have already invested into: it can all be sold for around the same price. 

Companies focused on growing weed in the US will have a very high cost of goods vs basically any other country beside Canada, which the CA players are already investing in lower cost areas such as Lesotho.

Long weekend are miserable, but let regular weekend be a time to strategize.
NIO day was so underwhelming...620 miles on a 150 kWH battery...in Q4 2022?? Tesla will be so far ahead of those specs by that point that it's not even worth taking seriously.

NIO has been the biggest benefactor of Tesla's meteoric rise.  So much FOMO driving up NIO stock price. There can certainly be multiple winners but this announcement was a dud in my books.

Anyways, Tesla > Nio

Champion is trendy in europe these days. But you shouldnt compare them to adidas/nike. They are different beasts. They have their hands in all kinds of things like sportswear, atheltic wear, celebrity collabs, footwear, merchandising money from selling their football products etc and they also dabble in almost all sports imaginable. All these things didnt come overnight as these brands have been building it all over their lifespan.

Champion to me is just a brand that changed its image to be fashion relevant to younger crowds. Unless they go to sports or branch out to other sources of revenue like nike/adidas then there definitely wont be a big climb.

If you went all in with that 20k on a 1/8 tesla 860c on Thursday before close, it would have been worth 500k at its peak on Friday, or about 400k at close. But could you yolo all of it on one play, and hold it through the ups and downs of the day or week? I sold mine at 500% and thought I did good until I watched it keep running up after a pullback.

I don’t know why this sub thinks because you’re not yoloing you’re not making money. I’m up 27% in 4 months just chillen. And I made some money on Tesla I’m just not willing to risk anymore than I did.
I threw 500 bucks in when it was already full moon, i've still made like 30%! lol I've got a stop on it just the same and even with a volatility buffer I'm still in profit if that stop triggers

Big moves are still bad. Selling options would have fucked you on Tesla. It also won’t protect you if Tesla halves in a day.
Fuckin wild man. I've been happy with my few shares of it. Wish I would have bought more back in the summer time... or just bought some of these insane options people are raking in money with.

I saw a comment earlier mentioning them and it changed my world view. I knew about roomba vacuums but I never really looked cause my house is all wood floors. This would save me lots of time if it's actually effective
Are you being serious or is this some sort of idiotic humblebrag? Sell 65 shares, buy a jan 2022 atm LEAPS. Do as much as you like. What does this do for you? You are buying a 65 Delta option for 27k, and selling 65 shares for 54k. You just locked in 24k profit, more gross, without reducing your overall leverage in TSLA, reduced your maximum risk exposure, and the option you buy is on next year's taxes as well and lt cap gains if you let it run all the way out.

Up
What are your thoughts about this stock now? It has run up past $200. I'm looking to invest long term as I truly believe in what they set out to do but am afraid of a pullback due to this insane run up. Would like for a pull back to happen so I can pick up more shares. Do you think it will pullback soon? if so what range?

I don’t know what I did... I’m 100% serious... Tesla 2000 EOY. There’s 0 way you lose your initial investment so I don’t really see a reason to sell unless you need money. Assuming you had 100k to drop into a single stock in assuming you don’t.

It seems like you’re talking about a covered call.  If you seek a put on a position you’re in, it’s like betting it’ll go up in two positions.

The US MSO's will stand to benefit more than the Canadian LP's from potential future de-scheduling, decriminalization, MORE Act, States Act, etc. in my opinion. Currently the largest US MSO's have a large head start and and entrenched position compared to any LP's that may eventually be allowed to enter the US market and try to compete. Additionally, the US MSO's are currently conducting business with one hand tied firmly behind their backs due to current banking regulations, IRS 280E tax code, and OTC listing. With upcoming legislation, all of these barriers will likely go away allowing for up-listing to NASDAQ or NYSE, better banking terms and loan structures, and repeal of 280E, increasing their growth and profitability even further. In the US MSO space I like the largest players (CURLF, GTBIF, TCNNF, CRLBF, HRVSF) or just buy MSOS (an ETF of US MSO's that contains all of these companies).

Yeah what ever you need to tell yourself so you can hold bags during TSLA’s 66% drawdown when we have the next market correction.

Never selling? So you gunna execute all these? Got the 300-400k to buy all these shares?
just looked that up, does not look becky approved, but man i will try. thanks for the recomend
This definitely is so close to the GOP elephant
What are you getting?
I'll upvote you for $50
What’s your forecast for the stock this week? I have calls expiring 1/15
This will boost revenue numbers. Bullish.
Same here man I just past 12k started at 4K and it feels good, it’s nice to see others on here with similar gains as it can be disheartening to see the people making 1m everyday
Nothing like august yet imo
that scene made me want to buy more stocks to be honest.
You guys get tired of reposting this yet?

You don't even gotta hate Trump but how you gonna perma ban the potus personal account when millions of people literally have a Twitter so they just retweet whatever he says?

WAREHOUSES, fuck all that other shit.
Holy shit you're pathetic... Some of your political bs has nothing to do with the market. You just like to be edgy and stir the pot. Stfu and fuck you.
I own CRSP, NVTA, BEAM, and PACB. I saw news on TD Ameritrade about it, ARK mentioned it in their email today and said it’s a big catalyst, and I follow these companies pretty closely.

Very excited to see what they have to say!
nah... a lot of people will buy it just to support them. i will.
Keep dreaming, ya big gay bear
Anyone else go look at Tesla gain porn to just put yourself through torture you don’t need

Alrighty.

What app is this and how can I invest and get returns and are we edging him to sell or buy? ELI5?
Life was okay, but The Stock Market Game (Avalon Hill) made me the degenerate gambler I am today.

Cash it all out and throw it on TSLA Feb 1200 calls
Anyone know how hard it is to go from pension fund to PE?
That’s funny. Why does my tesla still try to fly through red lights and constantly updating its maps?
Twitter puts Monday
So I have four positions here.

PACB, NVTA, BEAM, and CRSP

They’re all over-extended and could collapse. I will BTFD, though. 

I have thought they’ve been crazy for a while but have just held and been richly rewarded.

Out of all of them, NVTA is probably the one that is most likely to breakout. NVTA has revenue and has been trading in the 40-60 range for a while.

Yes but they can produce hydrogen with their plants which can be used to fuel said vehicles

"This renewable vehicle fueling solution was demonstrated for three years at the Orange County Wastewater Treatment Plant in Fountain Valley, California"
Why would anyone downvote me for asking a question?  This place is strange.

Thanks for the tip though.  Just looking at MT's chart historically, it went berserk in that year range.  Nuts.
You’re delusional. Waymo drives around downtown SF just fine. My tesla needs to be disengaged constantly
Make it so
Yo let me get a share at least
Do it with a percentage of it. Hold some of it... whatever you’re comfortable with “losing”. Maybe cut $2m set aside some for mister tax man. Buy a house with cash and put $500k into equities of choice, leave $600k in TSLA.

I have a 2 year old Xiaomi Roborock with no mechanical problems.  They are smart, they scan the area before cleaning.

I also had an iRobot before that.  They're dumb as fuck, they are like bumper cars hitting walls.  About a year in, the sensors started to fail.  I gave up on it.

I agree.  Even though it's a Chinese company, and things aren't good right now over there, but I think their stock is going to start taking off in just a matter of time.
Depending how much money you have aside from this and your age I would take 15-35% out and put it into some lower risk shit so you can better guarantee retirement. 15% stop loss on the rest. 

If you’re set outside of this leave it with a stop loss I guess
a tie

How much NIO are you holding?

1. You don’t know anything about me. 2. This is a Reddit to discuss stocks you douchebag. 

If you’re up 1,000% on a postion and not taking profits - you’re fucking retarted, don’t care how much you think you know or how little you’re looking to adhere to anyone else’s advice. 

Getting lucky doesn’t make you a fucking genius. Nor does success equate to being any safer from the market than you or anyone else was the day before. 

Even hedge funds lose money, nobody is safe, except politicians and their friends, CEOs, insiders... ok so quite a bit but you get my point. 

No go buy some $JUUL calls
it's my apartment
go fuck yourself
Looking at  buying June calls - which is better play, FCEL or PLUG?
BartComs are a good reason to buy XLE. All that  energy consumption is building top line energy demand. As prices go up, demand for mining goes up, and so does energy consumption

And that assumes not only "X" has been created, but "X" has successfully started some mars city. So you have assumed Musk has consolidated all his companies under one holding company, successfully colonized mars, and is now on his way to being one of if not the most influential man in the history of earth. 

You're sort of missing a few steps here, basically creating science fiction and acting as though it's the logical outcome.

Stocks going down is just a mindset.  If you think stocks will go down, you will sell-> they will go down.

Personally I would cash out the 2.6 million, that amount of money lets me know I don't have to worry about retirement at all. I'd pay off my house and all other debt and then stick most of it on the S&P 500 and then I am set for retirement.

Drink up
Why did it drop from $55 a few days ago?
okay, I know I sound like a broken record here but guys please please consider moving from naked calls to opening up spreads, you're probability of profit can be pretty high debating what your strikes are, but here's an example of how to make some $$

Do your DD on a ticker that has strong history and fundamentals, this includes basic TA and figure out support and resistance. So take a company like AMZN, I doubt this company will ever tank and it's currently trading around 3180 with 3500 being it's all time high. Analysts have price targets around 4k which is hopefull but not foolish. So how do you get in on this action? Say AMZN goes down 2% on a pretty red day with everything else? Open up a bull put spread and set your strikes down to 3080/3075 respectively and stretch out your exp to atleast two weeks, collect roughly 105$ in credit and when AMZN goes back up close out, free up your collateral and make another trade.

\-What happens when it keeps dipping even after I open the spread and my contracts have more extrinsic value? Simple, average down. 

\-Don't have money to Average down? well that's when Theta works in your favor and you can wait it out.

\-What if Armageddon happens and the underlying takes a huge dump and exp is close? then fucking roll out your exp and hopefully you didn't go full retard and overleverage your entire account into this one trade and if you did then you deserve to be here.
Look I like Elon...for the most part. It just makes me uncomfortable.
Yeah man. Some of these former presidents were actually smart
if the stock pops off early morning, and I don't have time to buy an option until midday, think its still free money?
And then 2000
Yes, but at the same time the last 3 months have been a lot crazier than the previous 9 months.

> But the transition to electeicic cars will not happen overnight

How long did the transition from horses to cars take, in years?

> If Tesla sold 2.5 million cars next year, maybe their share price would make sense, but that level of production is years away.

Two. That level of production is two years away. Maybe three.

> It's not an opinion, it's a fact that their office is outpacing their FUTURE earning potential. 

CAGR says differently.

> Btw, the ice vehicles aren't a negative, they're a cash cow in the end of their life cycle. 

Boy are you wrong. They are an anchor weighing companies down with expenses for a dead product line. Plus the companies have to transition and that's more costs there.

Getting MARA calls
Selling Covered calls doesn’t scratch the same itch as winning big on a call, but you’ll make money. If you’re looking for an income stream, theta gang, and if you want a thrill, then buy some calls with the premium and let the bull market make you a genius.

You could put all of it in something short term and risky like Tesla puts. If it hits you’re golden.
buy otm airline calls. Anything left over should go into otm cruise ship calls.
I may be hammered but with the markets rn I say Tesla will hit 10k this year without split, and spy to at least 420.

Nothing makes sense but go with the 🌊
I’d say soon. The chart is looking choppy now that Musk took the “Richest Man on Earth” title.

Feel like a lot of people may be realizing their money is in a stock with a terrible P/E ratio because of it. But who the fuck knows right? It may rally up to 1k and start dropping from there

Tesla is 20 times more expensive than Amazon at the time this video was made.   I get the analogy, but much more future growth is priced in to Tesla already, leaving much more mundane expected future returns.  The easy money on Tesla has been made.  I wouldn’t feel bad about selling here even if I missed out on some upside.  There are going to be better entries at some point when sentiment changes.

All the ARKs are really appealing . I think thy all have an ER of 0.75% and ARKQ and ARKW I believe all have 10% or more of Tesla in their holding ARKF tip holding is square I believe. The also have roughly $2 in yearly div per stock.

ARKK seems to be the all in one ETF the others are just more focused in finace, internet, EV, genomics to my knowledge.

They all have under 50 companies activly manged in all the ETFs.

I currently do not own any ARK but my plan is to fill my IRA with ARKQ ARKF and ARKW with profits from my RH. genomics could be huge but not my thing, anything medical has too many regulatory/social hoops to get through for my taste.

I am dumb and started investing before maxing ira.

I plan to hold ARK etfs till I retire 

Please go on the ark invest website and learn about each of the ETFs they have pdfs on the side of their holdings.

I just did stop loss at $750 - but that being said I already sold half my shares to lock in that insane profit.  If it dips to $600 next week I got the rest of my profit out. If it goes to 1k or $1,500 again and splits then I ride it out.

He also risks having his wealth implode from a margin call, which I believe was the short thesis a while ago, and why he hated short sellers so much. Had he not leveraged his personal income he wouldn't have a large reason to care about temporary dips in the stock price.

How do you price the bid to get it filled?  I’m still new to this.  1/22 180p for example has an ask of 0.55.  What is as good bid to get it filled?  Assume premarket -10%(-$20).  Current delta -.56.

Not sure that’s the overcorrection but the whole “take trump cameo out of home alone 2” is an overcorrection for sure.
Been watching it climb steadily for months never buying in. Feels like I’ve missed the opportunity now.
As a short term trader I would sell at an extension such as the one we had on Friday. Maybe collect half of your profits and leave the rest in there with that trailing stop loss. No point giving back 20% of your full amount.

Why would you buy any of that shit? That's how you fuck yourself. 2.5m is the point where you can just spread it between a few ETFs and sit comfortably on the returns.

The returns will allow you to say fuck you to whoever because you'll have a legit salary coming in from your investments. Buying fucking boats and prop planes? Are you the guys that win the lottery then file for bankruptcy within a year?

People here are dealing with thousands of dollars when TSLA holders dealing with millions, totally different mentality.
They changed the laws so you now need double the signatures and it has to be within a certain window it is officially started, and then on top of all that they probably throw them in the shredder. Basically impossible.

Serious question: do you honestly think this will be reality in your lifetime? Because I don't believe that will be possible unless driving yourself is made illegal, and therefore I just can't envision what you described happening, at least to any large degree. Maybe very localized areas of high population in progressive cities, like downtown San Fransisco, or planned communities in countries where the government can do whatever the fuck they want such as China.

Just use an options value calculator you can put in strike , price of underlying and expiry as well as the date you wanna know the value of and you can compare the returns there

Nah dude. Very bullish. Morgan stanley and argus analysts have targets around 4k, however their earnings are on the 22nd so be careful.

Excuse my ignorance, but wouldn’t a spread limit your up side? Like if you bought $25c and sold $45c, isn’t the ideal price at expiry $44.99? (You keep the premium for the $45c and cash in on the $25c intrinsic?)

Not necessarily true.
They reported better-than-expected Q3 results, but weak user growth. Twitter ended the quarter with 187 million daily active users, well below estimates of 195 million. It added just 1 million new users, vs. 20 million in the previous quarter and 6 million in the year-ago period.

there was a rebound in advertising demand, revenue climbed 14% to $936 million, above consensus of $777 million. Adjusted earnings of 19 cents per share topped views of 14 cents.

Yeah, I don't get it.

Math says 90c = 9k capital to cover exercise and if it goes to 100 in price, then the diff is only 1k in revenue.

Vs 70c = 7k capital to cover, and 100 in price = 3k revenue.

I don't see how the 90c gets you a higher return. I'm just not familiar with this.

It all depends on your risk tolerance. Is 100k a lot of money for you? If your 100k went to 1k would your life still be the same?
It just never dips enough after reaching ATH... it should but it never does. I hope you’re lucky and we dip to 790 and I can buy a cheap $1000 call.
I'm still confused by what criteria people use for these trendlines? Sure  you traced the lines up for a bit, but it could easily keep going down past the line like it did halfway through the chart.

The red line may as well be a twizzler.
where does water go straight down the toilet when you flush instead of clockwise or counterclockwise?
Reminds me of an interview with a famous investor (can’t remember who rn) basically saying his one regret is not allocating more risk/capital to bubbles saying how they’re very profitable because of the strength of the trend. 

Trending markets are a traders dream, direction doesn’t matter. It’s the sideways markets that kills options. 

Be grateful for periods like this when they come along.
Yea it's weird
How am I a bear if I have pure calls, 2 Tesla ones for this Friday also lol
Sir, this is a casino.
Of course you won’t, they only use them in their products. However, I do see Apple getting back a lot of their customers with their upcoming iMacs and the large MBP’s with their new chips. The M1 chip was a huge success that received a lot of praise even from well known Apple haters. They will only improve going forward.

I know this is /r/wallstreetbets, but dude, sell some of that stock and lock in the gains.  Let the rest ride.

I wouldn't have the balls to to ride it this long.  But If this is legit, I'd sell 1/2 my position immediately and let the rest run.  (In fact, I'd have sold 1/2 my shares in 2020 and had the room (tax wise) to sell the rest this year if things start to go sideways.)

For 99% of people, selling 1500 shares of Tesla is a life changing event.  If that's you too, then let that set in.
Of course, and they should...  but there’s no way more ads are the catalyst that makes them a 2-10bagger.

You can say that about any social networking platform but from a financial perspective, does it have any future?
If you study how Apple, Microsoft, Google, Berkshire Hathaway bought back their stocks, you will notice the pattern.

For example, Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway never bought back shares when the stock was at $7, $15, $500, $5000, 80,000 .... In stead, he started to buy back shares at $250,000. Still buying now at $320,000 per share.

Google recently bought back 25% of their shares around $1200. They didn't buy at $180. Same for Apple. 

They don't buy when it's low. They buy when it's high for a reason. Because they get so much cashflow, they can't find a better way to use the cash. Share buyback is a way to give dividend, without tax impact to the shareholders.

I think in a few years, Tesla will start to buy back shares around $3000 per share. Eventually they will buy back 30~50% of shares.

Short term dilution doesn't mean much. They could get $8B by issuing just 1% shares. They can easily buy those back later at a higher price.

I had a purchase order for 100 calls @ 1/16/2021 strike of 1,000 in Feb 2020. It was literally my last 100 dollars to my name. I thought for half a hour what kind of person i was if literally gambled the last money to my name on a 3x OTM call LEAP. They were .01 a contract.

I chose to use that 100 bucks to get a job at a ski resort with a girlfriend and be the "responsible guy"

Second worst fucking decision of my life. Fuck her and there better be another dimension where im sailing on a yacht around my private island...

That same 100 would be worth 30 million ish today

You could always put a mil into a quarterly div paying ETF like VTI or something.  Pretty safe bet.  They rise pretty consistently throughout their lifetimes.  You get the div + ETF growth.  Easily more than 4%.

Realistically?  Covered calls with an amount of shares you're okay losing.  Lowers cost basis, and gives you some sick money depending on the calls you sell.

Even if you only did half of your shares on 20-25%% out of the money calls, you'd be able to sell 15 covered calls at 540 apiece (1-21 1050C)  8100 bucks.

Do that twice a month and you're set my dude.  After a few round a bouts doing this you'll have the ability(IE Free capital) to buy to close your own calls if you feel it's getting to risky for your shares.  Hell, even if your calls expire in the money you still get the money at which the shares sold for.  It's a solid game plan, and a huge reason why Theta gang trounces alot of the tards here.

Either way, good for you man, you've done well.  Make that money work for you now.

All these TSLA gainz posts. If TSLA does happen to plummet suddenly, shit is going to get wild in here.
Lose the house in June?
No doubt about it

Honestly, looks like shit. But I'm hoping that's because much of the design was an afterthought and you wanted to get the data and functionality right first. Has potential if you formatted it better. Some of the functionality is broken though. You zoom in then out and you can't zoom in again. The UI needs some major improvements as well.

But maybe I'm just salty because I've been working on something similar and have been just cURL'ing CBOE's Options JSON data per stock.
next week let the girls locked in your basement pick the FDs, fuckin serial killer

P D A C is worth doing some DD on if you're looking for the next PLUG. It's a SPAC targeting a clean tech company and Jonathan Silver (Director of PLUG) is on the board.

Sadly, no options available (yet).
double black is honestly based, but fuck it's so expensive
CES is this week. From what I’ve read looks like there will be emphasis on EV. TSLA may test 900, but with CES being 100% virtual who knows how the market will react. Also keeping an eye on AMD as well.

Twitter is a useful global utility. Everyone uses it. They can’t find a way to make money.

I don’t see it ever becoming a golden goose that’ll give you epic gains.

It’s kinda just.... there 🤷🏼‍♂️
Even worse is when it feels like it's dry so you take it out and start folding and then you feel a wet spot
Thanks homie

EOW
I hate seeing shit like this.  I mean, good for you, for real man.  It just makes me think that I can do it.
Just watch Cathy Wood on YouTube. Better IMO
The guy started with close to a million though, so it’s not nearly as impressive as most of the gains you see on here.

Because one dogshit day and you lose all of you stock when it will most likely recover. Even with a trailing stop loss, if you planned on holding, a bad red day ruins your plans, probably needlessly. But if you started with a profit goal and you’ve already passed it, a trailing stop loss is probably the best way to ride the stock.

Obviously depends on where and what your plans are with regards to family and whatnot, so there's no point in arguing. But I'd say your figure is low-balling it slightly (unless that's after taxes).

I personally think it's unlikely that you'd want to not work at all, I think most people would get bored/restless pretty soon, so this extra income would turn any job you actually want to do into a cushy position. If you *do* want to not work and "enjoy life", 40k a year lets you travel in comfort in the vast majority of countries, indefinitely. Mix and match as you prefer.

Would deffo agree with them being the Apple of the EV world considering they have the same desirability factor as the iPhone. But would also maybe look at them as the hoover/vacuum cleaner effect where the  brand is associated as the product
Could happen, good reason. I think we have at least 6 months before this could potentially happen tho.
problem is i dont have anything close to enough collateral to hedge with a put or something. I can sell shares if I want though
Hell yeah play smart dont fomo. Take gains on some calls and let the rest ride. There are people on here that will teach you a lot but some people only try to pump bullshit so you gotta try to weed out those people. Weekend gang normally pretty knowledgeable.

Wrong idiot, TSLA has peaked and will soon reach the end of it's journey and become a boomer stock that moves 1% each day, whilst NIO's journey has just begun.

"Be healthy. Be real. This is discretionary spending, so be sure to use your discretion and not overspend this account. For my house, this is $1,200 per month, or about $25 a day."

I literally can’t find any news about $MT being delisted off Robinhood.
I'm not super experienced in technicals, I hardly use them but sometimes they can stand out and point out the obvious. Whenever tesla goes above 80 rsi it sells off soon after. It works like that for any stock but tesla is more volatile and the same for 30-40 rsi range to go back up. Humans like simple patterns and this is as easy as it gets. I might sell some shares since I can't buy a put to hedge lol. I'm pretty sure reddit banned seeking alpha but you can look up rsi tesla seeking alpha to get the prettiest graph
It's decent
Flow of money is all that matters
the moment i started making real income, i got into it. what else was i gonna do? just stack 10k in my savings account?
More stimmy, problem fixed.
also gotta say i really don’t wanna fuck my self playing with margin but i think i am addicted to gambling. I’ve made quite a few good plays and quite a few shitty ones and the shitty ones seem to be outweighing the good. down -3000 in margin. maybe i’ll just yolo some tesla calls at this point. my account was 5k->12k then went back to 5k. yes i know i’m fucking retarded and new and need some advice. only been trying options for 3 months now
Excuse me?
I don’t think it’ll affect it directly but indirectly. The news could bring FB and TWTR down which could bring down tech in general.

Why not tesla?

So tired of seeing sports, politics, video games, marvel and movie shit in here. This place has literally turned into mainstream Reddit. Fucking man-children. So many fucking basic questions and small positions too. The whole point of this sub is lost
🥲 ..this could have been me but i cashed out at 150%.. 

I wish i had cojones like yours sir. Good show and good luck! 🚀
Self half and let the rest ride into the sunset.

Even those who bought at the peaks only need to wait 4-6 weeks for the next peak, if people want to buy high, panic, and sell low and lock in those losses then they're truly retarded and would lose money on any other winning play.

And back to what you're saying, they'd still have 80% of their life savings, with that 20% spent on a very important lesson in not being a paper handed pussy.
I’m a fan. I love TSLA but a cheaper option? Don’t know enough about the FSD prospects yet to make a determination if I would buy if available. But huge China market
For sure. I don’t love it either, the real problem is the Internet is run by the 40 and 50 year olds that created it, and the government is run by 80 year olds that can’t send their own emails. Tech has way too much power right now
You could be the dude I sold my shares to
Well, she has said ARKG is where she expects the most growth
Yeah I guess it's possible if you discovered them early and got lucky, I didn't know shit about stocks when I was younger and neither did anyone around me, always thought it was for rich boomer to make small percentage gains on until I discovered this place.

Being institutionally held does help, but all it takes is for the hype to wear out and the % of sellers to be > than the % of buyers. Elon is going to keep taking advantage of the inflated share price via equity offerings for as long as he can; he doesn't care about dilution.

All I'm saying is, do you. If you want to risk 100% of your worth on the small chance of doubling your money, that's your prerogative. Before you do though, [please read this](https://static.fmgsuite.com/media/documents/e0b44881-0a53-4bc0-8630-3a4e70b27c1a.pdf) (if anything because it's a great read). It's a client letter about a similar situation

It was written in 2000 and predicts how events will unfold over the next 15 years. One of the author's predictions was that Microsoft ($600bn market cap at the time) was grossly overvalued, despite being a great business, and that it would take 15 years for the underlying business to catch up to the estimates baked into the price.

After the Dotcom bubble burst, MSFT didn't reach $600bn in market cap again until 2016.

Like I said before, I just think you should consider the risks: you can either cash out now and keep **60%** of your money (taxes will suck) OR you can keep it in Tesla to capture potential upside, but risk **90%**. If you cashed out now and saw the share price double, would you beat yourself up? If you held onto your position and lost 90%, would you have regrets? Those are the questions that I'm asking.

Despite my original comment, this isn't financial advice. Just factors that you should consider before committing to put 100% of your worth on the line. WSB doesn't like to talk about risk management, but most of us aren't playing with 7+ figures. You're risking life-changing money.
Starting with 10k for the new year, let’s see how far I can take this!

There's still chance of 20- 30% drop with institution correction base on this spike as they adjust portfolio size. It's just when and you'll have to quickly get out because I suspect lots of people going to go back in.

If you hold out for too long and Tesla decided to do another round of stock split... then it's going to be scary.

best of luck.

Monday right? If so, I think we can expect an amazing day for steel stocks to start the week.
I had 40 shares at one point... it’s okay though. Bought 12 shares a week ago and will buy more once cash settles on Tuesday. I can ride the NIO train, I’ll just be in the back 🥺
So was that initial $100k investment like a shit ton to you or are you quite well of where that 6 figure investment is more like a decent sized throw of the dice?
As a consumer behavior specialist who trades purely on retail market sentiment, I just learned about Elliot Wave from this post and it aligns with how I trade calls. 

Ive never set up these charts, but I do watch stock and option prices for pop opportunities based around consumer (retail trader) sentiment and predictions. 

TA based on company financials is actually for boomers, which is why boomers are obsessed with the dot com bubble. In a volatile market, especially ones that feels paradigm shifting and completely disconnected from reality, sentiment trading is the way to go. 

Tesla has had 12 up days in a row, EVERYONE is excited, confident, but nervous AF. Friday afternoon we had a minor pullback and quick recovery. But that's a sign of the shakeyness of the short term price. 

I am confident TSLA will be $1200 by end of year. But it won't go up every day. There will be a retail market panic sell within the next 4 weeks that will CRUSH options. 

If Tesla even trades sideways for two weeks, that will crush options for to IV dying. 

S&P matching funds have been buying retail sell-off dips and supporting the price so far. But that won't last much longer as they complete their acquisitions.

Does that mean you wouldn't consider investing in HUYA? I already have a big position in BILI and was thinking about taking a position in HUYA, expecting/hoping for it get some traction this year.
Yup. And not for options but on the 24hr indexes make sure you gtc_exto to cover share orders round the clock.

What does goev actually do/did I fuck up?
You’re right that it’s traded sideways. 

I am long term bullish because I believe interest rates will stay low for awhile, and refi business is booming. I believe the company, and it’s meme potential, is incredibly undervalued.
Ok guys I have a plan. I think we're in a bubble so I'm going to inverse conventional wisdom and go half retard (never go full retard) I'm gonna sell all my stocks, which are all up like over 100% the past few years. Then I'm gonna take like 10 grand and buy all the high flyer fomo calls I can for like 4-12 months out. That way I can scrape some cash out of the rest of the bubble and still have cash to deploy on longs at the bottom. It's not bearish its not bullish its only half retarded
Not good, pretty fucked up actually. They'll come for you next.

Yeah don't get me wrong, I feel like some of it is priced in, but some of the news is a surprise. One way or another, NIO is gonna be a gem in the coming years I think.
Man. I made my first $100 in a day on Friday and have been excited ever since. This is inspiration and also depressing at the same time. Congratulations bro.
Already pre-ordered 🤗
Yea at current price I feel like the market has already priced in for a great earnings. After the earnings people might sell on the news

Through this volatility and catalysts, fundementals and TA will cease to matter. GME to 694.20$.
It really is. Politically im torn, but thats not the question. Realistically the pipeline will be completed very soon. Until that point there is some uncertainty putting pressure on the stock.
Tesla is still cheap
December is safer if you can afford, June will be cheaper. Now is not the time to buy though unless there’s an announcement. Otherwise this will come back down to 25-28 and recharge for the LOI. This is straight up a “mystery box” investment right now - I just really like Bill and got in as soon as my broker eventually added PSTH.

Maybe sell and diversefy 🤔

50% Tsla calls
50% nio calls

Should do the trick
My FD’s hope so.
Dude sell the 25 strike 47 times for an easy 2k next week, and you would also make $5 per share if they get called away, that's a 20% gain, outperforming the yearly S&P500 performance three times over.

The decision not to do this is just plain greed and if the stock continues to fluctuate or even go down from here you're going to be worrying about this when you should be enjoying your life.

Just sell the covered calls. Max loss would be a GAIN of 20% in one week, forfeiting any gains ABOVE 20%. If the stock fucks around the same range, free money. Stock goes down, free money plus lowers your cost basis since you are long anyway (lord knows why). Again dude, 20% return in a week, or even a month, or even three months is amazing, dont get greedy from being desensitized by this sub

Dude, just want to know how can you resist the temptation of not selling after 2x, 4x, 10x, 20x?
NIO just announced solid state batteries that makes Tesla look like they are pandering cassettes while the CD just came out. Where's Tesla's solid state battery tech? They have none, they invested all of their resources making 30 year old lithium ion technology better but if this was Civilization they have been leapfrogged on the tech tree. That's just NIO; Toyota is also announcing their own, and Samsung has their own stuff.

Tesla vehicles are still, IMO, very vanilla, and built for nerds who value specs. I couldn't get my wife to even look at them even though they were in our price range. I see a lot of cool cars and they aren't Teslas. How many colors do they come in again? Black and white? I hardly see something that deviates.

Get off the ride. Let Cathy Wood  💎✋ those shares. The fact that she's invested in no other automakers should give your an idea of the tunnel vision Tesla longs have at this point. You can be smarter. Go get a vacation home once you figure out a place you like.

Devil’s advocate: shutting down accounts simply forces these groups underground, where you can’t track the ridiculous things they say on social.
what’s a good long dated call for low cost ie less than $200 for the contract?
Unless there's another historic run-up for ARKG this year, and Cathie decides another round of special dividends, I think LEAPS is the play here.
You only really lose when it drops big, and kind of if it goes up big.

If you haven't noticed, every hot EV stock follows similar trends, with Tesla as the big daddy.  Anything Tesla bullish pulls the entire sector up.  NIO  🚀  🚀  🚀
im pretty sure that is the reason i have over 100% gains last year and 12% so far this year

Possibly, but I’m not sure censorship applies to a private company banning the account of an individual who is actively using their platform to incite violence across the country. It’s Twitter, it’s not like the White House press corp or CIA burning books or some shit

Either way up to you!! Theta going to start creeping in, but this is daddy fucking Musk so who fucking knows... I'd say it's had a good run these last cpl months , but its a beast... if you diamond hand and make it to 20-30k a contract send me 5$ so I can grab some tendies at wendys. Goodluck!

Dude. Hold. You already suffered the loss.
Tesla 10% volatility now would be redic.  Personally I'd gamble sell 10% buy calls.  With a 10% stop loss on 70%  let 20% ride and will it to your wife's boyfriend.

Yeah true that’s why I also said he can buy whatever feels comfortable, $100 was just an example.
A Youtube-like business has more growth potential and is more profitable than a pure Twitch-like business. With that said, Bili has already been successfully encroaching on Huya's segment.  There's a reason why Tencent, which has stakes in BILI, Huya, and DouYu are forcing a merger between Huya-Douyu (which is now undergoing an anti-monopoly investigation by Chinese regulators).

With all brokerages going commission-free, I'm still shocked that people are still using RobinHood. It uses a 3rd party market maker so that trades are not real time. I made one trade with it just to try it out and set a limit order. Watch the price drop below my limit price and still not execute. It finally dropped more and then bought at my limit price. Using the Fidelity app, I have had it buy below and sell above my limit prices depending on jump. And I think the Fidelity app is much easier to read/use.

If you're going to be dissident to the system in a capitalist society you cannot RELY on that system to be dissident. How hard is that to understand? The people who want to go on parler and say whatever the fuck they want also don't think people should get to go do or say whatever the fuck they want. Big tech will appease Democrats because American politics is money bottom line. Get in line or have the power to self subsist.
Why never selling? I think it would be wise to sell with these gains
Ride it until it goes red!
people dont realize what 2000$ stimi could do to the markets.

I bought it when it was 1k a contract now its with over 10k a contract
ah yeah, thats a fair point. Also when "good" rates like CDs, Bank Accounts, bonds, etc are high, so are "bad" rates, like Mortgages, car loans, credit cards, etc. So yeah, there's always a counterbalance.

Like right now? Hah, good luck even finding a 1% CD. But man are mortgage and auto loan rates awesome right now.
Not even close. We just got done pricing in civil war 2
That's actually the definition because the number of shares is a constant, so if the stock goes up 5% then the market cap goes up 5%

I'm kind of an inbetweener. I was too young and had no money when these stonks were cheap, but I was totally aware that they would be a long term good investment. Not necessarily TSLA, but Amazon, Microsoft, Apple, etc.

But now that I have money, the stonks are too expensive. I do have some nice HSA investments and Vanguard funds that are doing well. But I'll never touch any gains like this.

Except Biden is pretty explicitly soft on China, and there is serious evidence that he is even financially beholden to them. In addition to the evidence from Biden's side of these deals, a lecture from a Chinese professor leaked recently. In the lecture, he brags about how China has infiltrated high level US offices. Iirc he even name drops the Biden family, but it's possible he just heavily implied Biden was involved, I can't remember.

Parler is French for “to speak,” and it originally used the French name “Parl-Lay.” 

But the user base was too fucking dumb to understand it, so the name became Par-Lur.
MT has almost no US exposure now.  The choice for steel is between CLF and X, CLF popped a bit more than X and I think there is more upside potential in X.  Nucor & SDI will be impacted much greater than CLF & X because they are exposed to the scrap market that is on fire right now for almost all of their input cost, X and CLF use their own iron ore for 80% of their liquid steel.  They also have HUGE volume and at these margins will absolutely look great on paper.  Long term they suck but if this commodity super cycle happens AND an infrastructure bill gets passed?  Huge!

a tesla is a nice luxury car, but it’s relatively low price point for a luxury car doesn’t scream “i got buku bucks”.  a tesla model 3 costs about the same as a BMW 3 series.  

i’m in roughly the same position as OP, pre-diamond hands, and NO FUCKING WAY do i have the balls to put up $100k on a single stock.  

and this is also why OP has $2.6 mil+ and i don’t.  he or she took a big fucking risk and it paid off.

The sad part is that Uncle Sam share you the profit like this guy if he is a single then you pay an average of 33% around 330k but when you lose money you only claim the maximum deduction of $3,000 per year up to 8 years that means 24k.

i don't know why and how people agreed on such rule. any idea .. i don't understand the reason behind such thing and i totally see it  illogical?
He wants to buy a call with a $61 strike price that expires on 1/15 and another call that has a $80 strike price that also expires on 1/15.  The 61c will probably cost a pretty good chunk ($400-500) so the stock price will need to be 65 or 66/share to profit ( unless he sells the calls later.
The man has 3000, just try not to be greedy and sell like $100 away from whatever current price it’s at or whatever price feels comfortable to him to where he won’t lose his shares.

It’s a basic truth of human psychology in sales.  You tell someone the product is $1000 and they complain that’s expensive. You tell them it’s $500 and they say that expensive. Tell them it’s $1000 but it’s on sale for $500 and they love it. That point doesn’t directly translate here, but the moral is not matter the price there will be people saying it’s too expensive.
Ebay
It's a fucking scam and I know it. We spend $9k/year in premiums and we get nothing back for it. 4 people in the family we go to the doctor once per year each. Those visits would cost about $250-300 each time without insurance. $1200 vs $9000. 

My wife is concerned if we have something bad happen we'd be fucked, but I keep telling her we can just get on a payment plan with the hospital(which are interest free btw) and pay it off over time OR just declare bankruptcy and wipe the slate clean. We already have a house so our credit doesn't actually matter.

Somewhat of a side story, but somewhat related..

Boston dynamics developed spot. Spot is a robotic dog that is like a really versatile robot that can move about in most human environments. It costs $74k. 
Unitree is a Chinese company run by an ex-dji guy who now makes robo dogs.
The unitree a1 costs $10k. It looks very similar. It does the same thing as spot, but at the end of the day it acts like a $10k dog, not a $74k one. Its the massive gulf of software that China can't cross. They can't possibly release a copy cat with similar function, just form.

I agree electric cars are the future. But the transition to electeicic cars will not happen overnight, and the 2.5 million cars gm did last year earned them cash, and made 2.5 million people a LOT less likely to buy electeicic in the next 3 years, more likely 5. Competitors will join Tesla in ramping, legacies will limp into the market, and it won't be a cakewalk for Tesla to just own everything. 

If Tesla sold 2.5 million cars next year, maybe their share price would make sense, but that level of production is years away. If you think 1600 PE is worth what they have now, you're missing the point. Look at it this way - even if you quintupled Tesla revenue next year and assumed 50% margin, their pe is still 76. It's not an opinion, it's a fact that their office is outpacing their FUTURE earning potential. They need to do about 100x better than this year by 2023 for this year's price to make any sense. 

I'm not saying Tesla sucks - in fact their mission is awesome, their product is killer (almost bought one but they are too small), and I'm very jealous of the tendies. But when their actual production and value become known, it is possible the shares sink to the seafloor or trade sideways for 10 years. Will they be a 2T company in 5 years? Maybe, but there are just better risk-adjusted options, the stock market is big. 

Btw, the ice vehicles aren't a negative, they're a cash cow in the end of their life cycle. They are the highest and best use of the production assets they have. Despitr that, I'm not long any automakers, it's a shit show out there. Ford and gm could be bankrupt in 5 years there so far behind.

The other thing I say to friends who absolutely loath him and compare him to Hitler is, “tell me one good thing he’s done because he has done some good things.” And they usually can’t say anything, but that’s on them, you know? That shows me the depth of their intellect. Because you just named the main good thing he did not do: get us into a pointless, senseless war

Why sell long term. Sell earlier expiry far OTM and not on all the shares. If it hits then let the shares get called away. 

1000 in 2023 is a joke. It will be 9000 by then.

Then again you can always cover the 2023 calls on a dip though but I sure wouldn’t short them and leave it.

I thought a lot about this. Yes because I don't have people constantly bugging me asking stupid af questions - other people are the question askers so less productive for them. A little bit no, because I only have 1 monitor to work off of at home vs 2 at work. I don't want to set a second one up in my living room.
It could be my lack of understanding, but even with disastrous results, is it really possible for Tesla to have a 90%  downswing when it’s part of the S&P 500 and so strongly institutionally held?  We would be talking Musk being arrested, financials faked, the discovery of greenhouse gas emissions being good for the planet. Am I missing something?

Totally agree. I have 10 245c. I wish I had the capital for more.

You aren’t entirely wrong. But the sector is only so large, granted they are easily expanding globally, which does justify its valuation
$2,200 for a NIO LEAP expiring Jan. 2023 (strike of 80) seems really cheap. What are the chances NIO doubles within a year...

No but only bc I dont fuck with chinese stocks, other than that I would buy call debit spreads because the bull flow and call purchases on this stock is ridiculously bullish.

Out of principle I dont touch china, got burned by LK.

My tip, dont sell covered calls yet, the flow shows more upwards movement and you'll get them called away

Some say NIO day was priced in, but I feel like all the reveals and news were good, just hoping no major sell off. But most people I talk to are more of LT investors and are holding thru no matter what.

I believe they primarily sell ATM CCs?  Not a fan of that.  I remember contemplating about buying a decent amount in my Roth back in Sep. 2018, but it hasn’t even returned to its price at the time.  Although it’s returned 25% dividends since then, I think holding QQQ and selling your own monthly OTM covered calls is preferable.
You’re less than 3.5% down on shares of the most traded large cap stock and you’re freaking out? I think even r/investing would have a good laugh.

Dumped PLTR. When every other stock and ETF in my portfolio posted gains over the last month and quarter and this didn't it means its time to cut the stock. Great company. No love for it market wise right now. Big data is taking a back seat to Solar, EV and genomics. Even my Oil future ETFS are doing better and are set to boom

My price target for TSLA is 45000, anything under that is undervalued. Logic: total market cap of the stock market/number of TSLA shares. Nothing else in the US matters, even if the country becomes a shell of itself with most of the population living under freeways, TSLA will drive the market.
Margin call
i want to see if anyone is even willing to buy that call when you try and sell it

Nobody was saying buy otm short date calls on GME, the play was always buy and diamond hand shares, or buy leaps.

Read Zero to One by Peter Thiel (PayPal Mafia and coincidentally PLTR co-founder) and you can actually identify what differentiates Amazon, Tesla and Netflix from GoPro and .......rofl, GME. 

PLTR is not a platform company. Gamestock is not a platform company. Tesla is a once in a century energy platform company, and that will be clear in 10 years if it's not already.

I leveraged my condo to buy TSLA in 2013 cause everyone knows when Musky (PayPal Mafia) starts building cars, it's not because cars are the end game. That's two moves ahead, tops. Papa Elon is 15 moves ahead at any given time.

She said she expects one sometime this year but literally the whole interview is bullish. It had more to do with blue policy tax increases. Which she states she already misjudged a pullback of the impact of a blue wave. Btw I a huge cathie and ARK fan.

Keep in mind if you sell a strike of a stock at $20, and the premium is high, like $5, don't get the $25 stuck in your head as your make or break for you getting to keep your shares. If the shares are $20.50 or over the strike at $20 the day they expire, they will probably get assigned. Some MM will swoop in and get them, as there will be a few pennies on the dollar to be made.

Don’t get me wrong, I don’t like Trump. But the fever pitch of the hate was intense. Like he started withdrawing troops from the Middle East  and people called him a traitor. All of a sudden the liberals became hawks and the conservatives were doves? Weird times.

What are the plays
Not a problem. Unfortunately I attribute the problem to the two party system. Currently there are like 5+ subsets of Republicans in varying degrees of radicalism. 

Trump or die white supremacists. 
QAnon.
Single issue Republicans (think pro life or gun control) who tend to be lifelong conservatives that won't break party even though they don't agree. 
Neoconservatives.
Lincoln Project Republicans who will turn on the Dems Jan 20th. 

That's just the Republican side 🙄 the Democrats encompass just as many. 

Ideally though, a minimum of 5 parties should be in power as that would save each side from being held hostage by a fringe group within the party. Think the Tea Party Republicans dragging the Republicans towards White Nationalism.

Not sure what SLV charts your looking at, but it's only ever had two points where it's been higher than the $16-$18 average in the past 12 years, and that's between 2010-2012, and the past few months

Obviously I'm not saying it's a good play, everyone is entitled to their opinions. I'm not replying because I think your wrong, but your comment stood out since what you were referencing doesn't exist. It's not a "up up up", it's never been. Hell, excluding 2010-2012, SLV hasn't had any real significant changes to their average price since 2008. 2008's $19 price for the etf is higher than anything from 2012-2019.

I think Vale has potential with Nickel, as Nickel is heavily in demand for EVs, and they are the largest producers in the world right now. Overall, MT follows steel prices closely and has alot of upside if you look at price charts. According to several people in the business, steel orders are backlogged for a few months at least. Basically I dont think now is a good time to short as i think steel companies are just starting their runup.
You better sell at some point, otherwise, you're just down the money you paid for the shares. Hold it long-term, sure, but hope all investors have some kind of goal they're going after.

You from stl area? Shout out.
This. For example, one of the main and most commonly used 'funds' federal employees can select to invest their federal employee 401ks in (known as the TSP) is nearly 7% TSLA. When some GS-15 sees his TSP lose thousands of dollars a day when TSLA turns south, they will pull their investment and put it in the bond fund or similar, which means they are pulling all their shares from other companies in those funds.

This is a small tiny sliver of the pie, but just replace the who and the what they are pulling from with investment vehicles all over the country, and it's bad news.

There are primarily two kinds. Calls and puts. With calls you’re buying the right to a stock at a certain price on a certain date and then hoping it is worth more than that on that date. You can then buy the stock at the price you agreed on and it’s worth the price on that date. It’s kind of like gambling because it is pretty much gambling. A put is the opposite. It’s the right to sell at a certain price on a certain date. In essence. If you buy a call you want the price to go up. If you buy a put you want it to go down.

Why can’t it make $900 and and still end the week lower than this weeks close?
... what's NIO's PE again????

Have u considered selling call options at stupid high strikes, and then buying puts? If the stock trades sideways u win big. U win as long as the call options are not exercised against you..
But I have SNAP and TLRY .. am I **really** in trouble ?

Will fuck! It’s one year out, you set up the trade at 5$ premium and if it fills, great! If it doesn’t fuck it... try again next day, what’s the rush!! And this is a trade for buy and forget it. fuck it if it doesn’t fill! (Ps it will when it gets closer to expiration)
true. but the cccp fuckery always makes me cautious.. but this has costed me lots of money before.

I hear 45 days is best but honestly I like selling weeklies even though it's more stressful
Huh. I've noticed those big volumes right near the close and I've heard people say that's all you need to see to know how the next day will go. How reliable is it in predicting direction of the next day? Isn't it a bit too obvious/easy?
Should I sell my ARKF and move into a diff ARK?

There is a $50k cut off...so xpeng and Tesla get them...not Li.  This is partially why Tesla has had to cut prices of M3 in the past to get under the threshold.

A few months after the new policy with cutoff, CCP changed the policy to exempt cars with battery swapping from the cutoff.  So just Nio.

Supreme Court decides the fate of this investment in June. Not selling a single share until that
Yeah but him telling you to cash out at say $100 is different, because your cash out then was a big profit, but not 'do what ever you want the rest of your life' money. Once you have enough that you can live off interest in upper-middle class comfort, and then pass on the same amount to your kids so they don't have to work, etc, that is a pretty good time to tap out.

Im going to blow everyones’ mind with this one. Every child you have after this one, it will reduce how much you pay this babbys momma.

☝
With margins, you pay interest and go the risk of getting squeezed in the event that Fubo fluctuates (which likely will do!!) vs, opening a spread and leveraging your money
What are we looking at here?  You bought 600+ contracts of GME at the $30 strike?  So you put 60k into a call?  

I assume you understood the risks going in and you fell on the losing side of that trade, that’s how the market works.  Better luck next time.

I bought some MT calls on the dip on friday but i heard biden say he was planning on focusing stimulus that direction. Ill take a look though thank you sir
Guess you can't read
It depends on what you want out of this OP. I have some TSLA too- thought not nearly as many shares, and nowhere near as nice of an entry price. The stock has been volatile. A 20% stop loss if it triggered would mean you lose about 500k from here and walk away with 2.1M if it triggers Monday. [press X to doubt] 

So I think 20% is a good bet, it would cost you 500k if it hits Monday, which is unlikely, but it leaves you with downside protection but isn't so close to the current price it risks being triggered by Tesla's usual volatility. At 20% you'll likely walk away with more than the 2.5M you have now as I dont think it's gonna hit for a while, especially with earnings right around the corner- we may continue to run up to earnings.

Set your stop, let everyone say Congratulations, then spend some tendies on some lube and go fuck yourself. :) 

Hope to hear people tell me to go fuck myself in a couple of years.

I sell SPY 3 times a week.(Monday expiring Monday, Tuesday expiring Wednesday, Thursday expiring Friday.). 
  
 I sell at whatever strike currently gives me .15-.25 a share.  
  
So I'm making roughly .15% a week on something I was holding anyway.  
  
I also do weeklies for AAPL but it is much more volatile.
Average cost per share 32.66 I'd say hop off at 33.69

But that's how I've made my dozens of dollars.
I have ICLN leaps, even Friday when it dipped still went up.

If u sell calls at 1,000 and it hits 1,000 then u can have a buy stop order that buys more shares. So even though ur shares will be called away, you are buying again and wont miss the run to 2,000.

They are already running battery swap in China. Check out some of the YouTube videos. I also thought it was a dumb idea but it is a subscription model so you don't have to own the battery. Works for all of those apartment dwellers in China too.

I will note I bought and sold on the way up. Last lot was sold for a profit leaving the one lonely share as a watch list because how volatile that stock was. Straight lines up and bleed down. Loved playing it for a while.

yeah definitely. Even if you only got 2.5% per year that’s like 65k a year. Basically put yourself on a salary to do nothing for the rest of your life. 

Say he only does 1.3 on super low risk stuff for 2.5% and does SPY for the other 1.3 on SPY for the average 9.96% annually, that’s a total of 150-160k per year he’d be living off of. Pretty sweet life
Gotta stick the ruler through your body and measure from your back.
I agree with you. The chart looks absolutely ridiculous and the fundamentals do not in any way justify the price.

Amazing Satire. This is the kind of stuff people should inverse.

NIO has some things going for them, but they have a long road ahead. The battery swap you mention isn't new batteries it includes batteries that can't hold a max charge. It's also capital intensive to swap junk batteries so I'd be interested to hear if they're making a profit off of batteries as a service. I'm not bearish on NIO, but some people have their head in the clouds.

This my friend is true.
The biggest thing that changes is your daily routine. Babies are 24/7,needing to eat or get changed and then screaming if they're not. This might be 3 am or it might be right before you leave for work, you never know but it's round the clock. Second thing that changes is your environment. No more ashtrays and empties laying out in your living room. All your shit has to be put away yet your house has never been dirtier. Third thing is financial. Babies are cheap but it changes the way you think about your money. Suddenly you're longing the Gerber Life Grow-Up plan and buying bullion at spot price to hide away. Yolos will be much less intense when your money is needed for diapers, bottle liners, and onsies. All in all it's well fucking worth it, and anything you can't do anymore with a baby was probably not that good for you anyway. Congrats old man!

nevermind. If you're over the income limit you cannot contribute to a ROTH. I know about backdooring an IRA to a ROTH but not vice-versa. Your contribution of $6K means that you must have at least $6K of income from a "job." You cannot fund a IRA or ROTH with proceeds from investing, unless that is your job ("professional trader"). If then you are talking about a IRA to ROTH backdoor, realize that when you convert IRA to ROTH you will be taxed, seeing as your future ROTH withdrawals are tax free. hope it helps. Google knows all about this, as her/him.

I think the best play available at the moment is 1/1/2022 calls for CRON. They are cheap and the upside is tremendous. Plus they are Marlboro's play on Cannabis. I'll be dumping as much as I can into these before the banking bill boom then sell them into the news to get shares during a dip to ride out with until legalization. Play the Theta gang life for a bit with your shares while you ride it out. Next Senate election is in 2 years so we should be safe from an all out crash until then, as any news should be positive considering those with power are in favor of movement in the right direction. 

If senate flips red before meaningful change is made, then it's ka put. I feel confident in saying we will get baking reform quickly with this government, but beyond that is within reach: I just don't know how far they are willing to go in 2 years.

Broke up with my girl of 7 years back in july. I feel you brother. It’ll get better.
I mean it depends.  But if you have high enough conviction in the stock then why sell?  This is like amazon or apple for some people.  

If its a trade then you would sell.  I have a few companies I dont have strong near as conviction in yet.  Those I might take of the table on a quick jump.   

But tsla and arkg are good ones to hold IMO.  You just for to know your stance and keep reviewing why you have it and where you see the position going.

Dude, I have zero TSLA anything. But there is no way it crashes now. Getting into the S&P means that institutions and mutual funds own so much that it literally can't go down significantly for a long time. Like 1-2 years. The only tsla crash at this point means the whole market crashed
The massive amount of shorts could squeeze if the run up to earnings pushes the stock high enough. But a lot do that depends on if there's good news between now and the q4 earnings reports.

If GME blows past the earnings consensus then that will almost certainly start a squeeze. Earnings is March 24th.

Edit: at any point they could announce a stock dilution and destroy everyone but the shorts. It's a huge gamble that I wouldn't be comfortable putting all my eggs in. I think I'm around 15% or so of my play money in GME. Plug and workhorse are my rockets. One has paid off. Just waiting for USPS to sign that deal with workhorse this quarter to start the next one.
No, I have a vanguard account that is super boomer. This is my fun money. My husband and I decided I could have $5k to play and when I was doing well, we invested a bit more in stock.

You’re basically riding short term trends and you would use trend following indicators to look for the trend turning like MACD or OBV going down. Or a day that volume exceeds 100M shares.

Also, position sizing limits risk
Nice plan but , have safety net just incase Tesla won't pull up

I expected NIO day to be like Battery day. I was wrong about battery day, meaning I’m assuming I’m wrong about NIO day. So calls. But then I should always reverse myself. So puts. But stocks only go up, so calls. But WSB is 90% bullish, which besides TSLA almost always means it’ll fall. So puts. I bought puts. I’m always wrong. I hope you bought calls.

43% revenue growth rate, and SoFi is a huge brand for fintech. People will get priced out of SQ fairly soon, could be $300, 400, 500. SoFi is the next-in-line fintech to chase.

Toss it into ARKF, even more hype. And right now? It's trading like a $1.5B company. Pumping this to a $7.5B equivalent will be like it's nothing. Doesn't need to get there before merger but there are multiple paths to an absurd valuation.

Right, but how high is too fucking high? Sure, if I made 100k on TSLA so far risking 10k is easy. But us fucks with small accounts can easily be wiped out in a single week of correction. Hell everyone here can be wiped out with a true correction. 

Everyone knows it’s overvalued. But how much is TOO much overvalued? That’s one scary stock right there.

But think, up until the late 80’s most companies had a pension plan AND healthcare was provided by your company free of charge.

Don't do SPY options in a taxable account (unless you're a RobinHood retard cos it doesn't have SPX). Do SPX options (1 SPX = 10 SPY) instead to get 60% long-term /  40% short-term tax treatment no matter how long you hold the options for.

Otherwise you're paying 100% ass raping short-term taxes on SPY option gains.  Could have saved yourself well over $30K in taxes with SPX instead of SPY.

Well done, you now reached one third of either VW or Toyota!

The market cap then should be around 40 to 60 bil. About the size of BMW.
Sentiment is pretty fearful i might sell at market open and wait for a correction.. If you sold tesla now, theres really only so many more times it could double this year and youre already so far ahead, i think youd be cozier in your new house and car and wife after you cash out. Then reinvest half in NIO or something.

I'm thinking it'll be $200 by end of 2022.
Well if OP had actually read why GME could moon he'd have clearly seen there was no fucking way a 1/15C OTM would pay off. Which is why all the DD posts said you need to buy shares and if you're absolutely going to buy options they needed to be yearly or April leaps.

If you're so stupid to buy options without knowing how quickly they can burn you then I don't have much remorse.
You could end up with overvalued NIO shares and worthless leaps, that’s the down side.

It's hard to know how to fight mania.

Nothing is certain, but Tesla's stock price has completely dislocated from its underlying fundamentals. Even before when folks were saying this, the company wasn't actually "overpriced" - e.g., it was still trading within a reasonable range for a high growth company, and if you re-capitalized R&D, it wasn't *too* insane. I was personally long then.

Now, we're looking at a company that is pricing 10+ years of optimistic growth. Sure it could go up, but if it does it's **entirely** due to multiple expansion (i.e., convincing a greater fool to pay a higher price).

Anybody who honestly believes Tesla should be worth $1tn right now is a bullshitter. Elon doesn't believe it, which is why they've been equity financing for the past year; I don't actually buy that Cathie believes it - she's too smart and has already made her money, but ARKK is locked in.

Tesla is about to pull a Microsoft circa 2000 and all of these "never sellers" are going to end up as the bagholders.
Nobody knows who you are.
Never bet against Papa Elon
Forget GME buy  Ford
Never meeeee
Cause it ran 80% in less than a month and up 20% from last resistance  so it’s obviously due for another 80% gap up. Agree with the options but timing is late AF and too early now. I bet it cools a week then goes vertical after Biden puts his hand on the good book
6 living right?
This is the way.
The bubble is far from over. If people get 2k, those who have been working remotely, hearing about the market mooning will tell themselves "well I don't NEED this 2k so I'll invest it" new ATHs.

Another cool one would be Zeolite heat storage. Basically a material that stores 4x more heat energy than water, and somehow store the energy chemically, so the Zeolite itself isn't hot. Then when it interacts with water, it releases the energy back as heat, on demand. Could use mirrors to heat the zeolite during the day, and release the heat to spin turbines at night.

Could be wrong but I doubt it didn't play some sort of impact in revenues simply because I know a few windows only people that finally bought macbooks for battery life.

This is all hindsight 20/20. Just because something didn't work out doesn't mean you made the wrong decision, at the time you made the decision. The converse is also true. 

Sell covered calls at the strike you feel comfortable. If it busts through, so be it. At least you made money. I have "lost out" on sizeable gains selling covered calls, but a vast majority of the time the options expire worthless. Being greedy works for a lucky few, but seldom for the rest of us.

40% taxes on 100k income (with full 401k contribution) is quite too high.  [Here's](https://i.imgur.com/9xLN5j2.png) the output from an income tax calculator, showing a low 20s tax rate. Without the contribution it'll be a high 20s. Far from 40%. I also reject that a 2K/month apartment will be that bad, looking at what's available on the market right now in SF. If you live further out towards the west side, you can get even better deals than that.

hahaha, have you ever checked 5min TSLA charts? every fucking dip bought immediately, to go down from 880 to 850 - it took almost whole day with ridiculous volumes, all BERs ARE FUK, you playing against the trend here, so probability to win is lower, so this is more likely gonna be loosing play, dunno, don't be stupid, don't try to tell the market what to do

Futures prices slide off after February FYI. Iron ore prices are high due to China-Australia geopolitical tensions, scrap metal is hitting markets at record amounts. I don’t think iron ore is the way to go unless you were on vale a couple months ago. If you’re going to go steel, maybe NUE for finished steel products and X for steel pricing(not my jam after thursday). I sold out of X on Thursday, and I’m holding onto my steel put leaps because my X calls made up the price of the puts +10%(profited 10% off the full wedge and have an empty play that can provide another 20x profit).

BETZ Calls are way cheaper premiums and heavily undervalued IV imo 

Low volume though, just like ICLN when I bought my leaps, so you want to get them as far out as you can. It’ll be easier to exit the position when it’s time to.

Using a chicken to predict tendies is bullish af.
With long-term holds you end up with extra tax problems if you have high earned income and a 7-figure investment account that is 100% holds all with LTCGs.  If your AGI + investment income is over $250k ($200k if single), you get hit with the 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax on the capital gains appreciation overage.
Paying 15% is always better than 18.8% but you have to structure every year to make it happen.

it'll hurt, but not that badly. People don't understand our progressive tax system. The "multiply by .63" people are the ones who think every dime you sell is in the 37% tax bracket when a huge chunk will be lower.

Also, if he holds the shares >1yr it moves into long-cap stocks, and the rate drops to 15-20% or something.
Yes, unless you buy a crap load and the stock moons like crazy and you get a call from your broker and they think your name is Marge.

Is a covered calendar spread a thing?

Like say I want to increase my leverage by going in deep otm long calls but I think IV is high. To pay for some volatility I sell a near month option at the same strike (~.30 delta). I’m extremely bullish and am worried the ul will explode and my calendar spread ends up getting crushed. I buy lots so the near month contract covers all my shares. Now I basically just have cc and long calls or am i not thinking of the pros / cons correctly? Do I achieve my desired trade with this setup (fund / hedge IV while still profitting off explosive upward move)?
rookie numbers,, made more than this in an hour
Doesnt add up. Buying 3k shares at 36 a share in 2019 was presplit, that would be worth over $12M now, not 2M.
That is when you buy. IV is really low.

It has been consolidating for months. Might pop next week due to NIO and CES news
Dude could easily be making 10k a week and his only risk would be selling 1/3 of his shares for a million dollars.

IMO this position should now be more on preservation rather than growth, covered calls is one way of doing so
I sold SLV options the week before it blasted off in July after holding them for four months. Made $1800 on them. Two weeks later would’ve been $80,000. I fkn killed it this year.

900c checking in
The year is 2033. Tesla stock has consistently continued to rise at 8% daily for 13 years. There are two classes if people, Tesla shock holders and slaves. The world is in shambles, nobody can afford anything except for soylent green purchased with the weekly $600 stimulus checks. The stock market has collapsed because Tesla market share increases more in 20 minutes than the entire rest of the economy has gone up in the history of the world. The dollar bill is meaningless paper, and dodgecoin is the only way to buy Tesla. Too bad Tesla owners never sell so they have no ability to buy anything, but they get all of the internet points and suck each other off looking at how low their price per shares purchased are.

why does it scare you?  

I hold only shares (less than 100) and see stop loss as the only safety net
Just been riding around the galaxy with Elon, Rick & Morty. We just passed by a floating Tesla a couple hours ago.
I bought TSLA around 180 pre split but sold around 220 to rebuy lower but didn't pull back much. Watched it fly and wish I held.

Then I bought around 360 during the March crash and sold around 420 again to rebuy a bit lower only to see it fly.

My whole body is made of paper.

They're comparing how their future product is better than competitors current product which doesn't make any sense. Also their "solid state batteries" are shared between multiple other car manufacturers including XPENG. I'm bullish about NIO but I think I'll look towards buying some TESLA for the first time.
I see that the viewing of this meme increases at the same rate as TSLA. Ok, then...

I also can't believe I watched this 300 times.

One day a kid will say my grandpa bought me a 100 dollars of tesla at ipo and now I'm a billionaire.  Tesla will soon own apple, microsoft and Google after becoming the first quadrillion market cap.  They will buy Amazon and give the company away on a contest just for fun.

Can't say how many times I've seen the same statement of waiting for tesla to go down since the past year. The only way I can see it going significantly "down" would be a split soon which makes the price seem affordable but the company still overvalued.

yeah you will then have 30 days to redeem them for 1 share. If its cash (most of them are) you will pay 11.50 and get a share, if its cashless, then the warrants will redeem at a ratio to shares depending on the price of each at no cost to you. Most are cash though as companies want more money, but cashless is less dilution. If you don't redeem them, or sell them in the open market within 30 days, then they will expire worthless. Let them expire worthless = goodbye money.

You buy 100 shares for $1 each. You have $100 of shares that you spent $100 on. You sell a covered call for $0.01, and in a week the stock hasn't moved and the option expires worthless. Now you have $100 of shares that you spent $100 on, and $1 cash. Another way to look at it is that you have $100 of shares that you spent $99 on.
Your first mistake was expecting things to make any sense..
Hey man... I pretty much only do TA with patterns, levels, and fibs... if you’re good at it, you don’t need much.
Wouldn't it be better to buy the $40 strike when selling the $45 strike?

I assume you are expecting it to rise above $45 by that time, and you would get 500% return rather than the 300% when buying the $25 strike.

I mean of course they look great. Generally they are gonna benefit from opening of small businesses all the way to rapid expansion of the big guys. It is a good play in the marijuana industry in my opinion. 

However, I don't think an international market opening would be stellar for them as they would be selling to a much smaller % of the growers selling marijuana in the US.

Quick explanation on who the fuck this guy is?  I'm not that young.
Logarithmic scale FTW
Et7 is $70,000 for 311 miles of range. Model 3 is $43,000 for 353 miles of range. 

$78,000 to get a 435 miles of range Nio. 

Nio's FSD plan is crap because it will rely on lidar, which is fundamentally incapable of reaching true autonomy. 

Nio stock will probably go up on the coattails of Tesla, for at least a little while longer. Long-term though expect major corrections.
This is what scares me. I’m not in Tesla, but a bunch of others in the sector. I feel like Tesla is the benchmark for all of them.
It will get eaten up like nothing happened and make the company even stronger

You are right. Sell calls at a level I’d be happy selling at and if they don’t sell rake in some money. I was afraid of them hitting when I’ve done this in the past but if I sell at $1,000 I shouldn’t really complain. Unless it goes to $2,000....  lol

OK how about this. We know Cathie bought this at $82ish. Anything Cathie buys tends to go up fast. So you sell your long puts and bank the 10 k profits. You hold the short puts hoping the stock ramps up. If you can afford it you get assigned the stock and keep holding for a couple more weeks and hope that the selloff was overdone and you just need it to go back up to around 105 to break even.

I know what you mean the batteries are the game changers and all the self driving computer tech but  my point is that bearings will be one of the few precision made machined/ ground items in the EV car assembly. A lot of the parts and housings and terminals and wires will be mass produced parts with wide open tolerances. But the bearing engineering   will move in sync with the motor and transmission drivetrain tech and become very specialized and the manufacturing process will be very demanding and they will be expensive.

Oh we’ll pick up NIO & ICLN On the way 

🚀🏝🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
So they design them... as Elon has said, making the machine that make the product is 10000% harder than design. Which is why Nio is no competition to Tesla
Why is it that Nio's cars have so much more of a significant range? You would think Tesla's batteries would be better or on par, right?

I try brother. It’s like every time I diamond hand it just gets worse and worse lol. Doing it now with all my silver/ gold/ miner positions. They were finally green after holding for months until Friday.

I've been wrong many times in the past, as I thought for sure Trump would have crashed the economy with the trade war with China.
And then what? Force us to exchange each warrant for a share or?
We’ve all fallen victim to this. Don’t worry. Happened to me in September. I made 2000% (115k) on SPY calls in one day when it tanked then bounced off its 100 day MA. I then felt like I was a trading God and gave most of it back within a week.

alright update on my uncle:

After hearing about his bad experiences with LSD I asked him about it and he said "they're going up I think? I'm kinda removed from that" HOWEVER his office is right next to the GM of the factory and says he hears him on conference calls discussing steel prices all the time - he told me he'll ask him what he thinks about it. He'll probably text me an update sometime next week.

Wanna here something sad.  I YOLOed into PRPL for the month of August and missed out on the tech run.  Finally bailed after a huge loss and bought tech shares late August.  FOMO kicked in for me Sept 1st.  Sold all my tech shares for tech leaps.  THEN Sept 3rd, happened.   I have been crawling back but I was in a pretty dark place early Sept.
Honestly, cash out and invest it all in dividend stock and live off the free money each month.

1000KM MY ASS! LMAO
That's definitely true for some, but I feel others don't understand that they can pin their risk by selling a short position against a long position they own. Sure it caps the upside, but many would be alright with that for the reduced risk. You still need to be right but not nearly as right to still make money.
That’s how I found this place
Uh, to be honest with you, I wouldn't touch them. They are only valuable because of the restrictions on advertisement. Remove those and you remove a lot of their value. They are a search engine? Let me show you google. They have online menus? Yeah, so does Baker. With loyalty program software to go with it. 

Same principle as Industrial Innovative Properties. They are a REIT directed at the cannabis industry. They are essentially filling a gap that's only there because of current laws. If you change the laws, you change their value too. I'm sure big banks can offer better terms on real state than IIP. Plus, who wants to compete with the big banks? 

Aphria speaking at the JP Morgan Conference on the same day as a US President wasn't a choice made lightly. So I'd expect big changes or news soon, and what's good for the industry isn't always what's good for 3rd party companies. But do you boo boo.

Agreed. I own puts right now and plan to open more next week. $TSLA <$200 by next year is entirely plausible (and arguably likely).
So invest in Tesla? Is that what 🍉 means

As a fellow Belgian who has been using Bux Zero for about a month now (and has  €400 profit on my 4k investment, thx Tesla) I'm quite fond of Bux. It has the potential to be an European Robin Hood and they're doing constant updates to offer as much as possible. the graphs are quite lackluster tho but there's enough info to be gained on the internet to circumvent that.

Coca-cola and Tesla are both red. Growth since IPO is a perfect measure. Makes sense
China is going to fuck you
True, high volume options are much easier to get a good fill. RH doesn't give the best fills compared to other brokers based on how they make money. So getting good fills on RH could still be difficult for Tesla spreads sometimes

I don't want to attack you over this, I'm just curious if you have anything else to add since this has passed.
Imagine being a retard who has no idea about the market or the product they are buying. You put $150K into TSLA most likely around March when this company was a fucking meme. Not a single person believed it was going to moon x10 but you yoloed $150k anyways. Imagine knowing such a retard in real life LOL. No amount of returns or money is going to change how retarded you must be in life and people around you or the people you meet probably notice that from a mile away.
How do you do fellow autists...
\#4 difficult because the structure of the data or wot?

also would be nice when entering a ticker if the available strikes are returned for a selected date. even if you return a dictionary where the key is the expiration and each expiration contains a list of strikes. basically if the intent is to see option activity it isn't time efficient to have to enter each strike manually. what i'm getting at is make an api and lemme bypass the ui while reaping all the benefits and sending your bank account to oblivion!

I'm dealing with this myself but let's not forget there were multiple instances of finance issues, near bankruptcy, and general goofishness from Musk himself.

That's not a bad strategy. No one ever went broke taking profits. You could also roll your position out and up to reclaim a portion (or all) of your cost basis but still be connected to the upside for your original play

one more question....  $100k would be a lot for me to invest on one stock, especially during the risky stages when you did.  when i speculate i’m only throwing down $5k (here’s looking at your hyliion, you piece of shit stock).

is $100k not a large sum of money for you?  or are you a true degenerate?  jk
So you’re the fkin retard that’s buying up the dip while I’m trying to short this retarded ass company. Lmfao.

I can't wait for tesla to go down, it very over priced for its position. P.S I like tesla a company but stock price is not justified
Yeah, this is dumb post. I swear you guys know nothing about market penatration. Tesla IS EV's right now and probably will be for a while. Doesn't matter if there is a superior product currently (and there isn't IMO).

Remember betamax tapes? Surprieor to VHS is pretty much every way, and yet was never more then a niche thing. Until something changes, that's how I view every other EV company

Nah, but I spent a year there back in 07. Great year. One of the better times in my life.

Very few rotating parts within a ev drivetrain compared to a combustion engine. Battery cases and plastic components can be 3d printed or plastic injection molded which is awesome and does not require extreme precision, but bearings will be central to performance and the demand for the bestest most strongest highest tech will increase.

Anyone who has made a play for cannabis before the Democrats took the senate were basically pissing in the wind. Marijuana is now in the best position it has ever been since becoming illegal.

If someone is mad marijuana didn't jump well before any clear path to real reform, I have no idea what to tell them. Lol imagine buying weed stocks in 2018 and not expecting to hold a bag for 5-10 years. Boomer shit.

Just hold it. Tesla has just begun and no one is even close. Fuck NIO and Rivian and the others. A serious competitor has yet to enter the game. The only way it could go south is if Musk goes to Mars and is never heard from again.

Dude if you used margin you should probably sell and take the win tbh
Pay off or buy a house, buy in cash a cheap duplex to diversify. Then let the rest ride, figure that is about 300-600k all together. Considering my house and a duplex ran me just about 320k. Its pretty great to have two people give you a 1/3 of your yearly wage income just out of laziness. So really with that I could work 2/3 less and still be where I was two years ago far as total income.
People act like Twitter has never banned someone before

Stripe CEO said “there is no such deal.” I’m betting it is stripe and that we will soon look back and say that he forgot to say, “yet” at the end.
That guy has the balls. What re u going to do, sell or hold untill what day or price ?
Honestly this is smart.  2k shares is right around 1.8 mil.  Put that in some boring ETF or dividend stocks and you could pull 70k per year with the 4% rule and never run out.  Plus you'll have another 1000 shares of tesla which is more than enough and will probably be worth another 3 mil in 5 years
Want 600 or so more?
You know you don’t have to sell it all at once right? Set price targets and sell when it hits them. Like you could sell 50% now, then 5% every time it goes up $100 (or whatever increment you chose) then stop selling when you reach a certain % and let it ride. 

Remember, these are just paper gains until you actually sell.

SPACs are my savings. Anything in the $10-11 range with decent management, you can't go wrong just selling before the merger is completed. Might take a year for 5-10%, still better than 0.5% from savings.

Another thing to consider - you can sell covered calls on some SPACs, just keep them like 5-10% OTM, sell it monthly. Minimally boosts your yield by another 5%.

VYM (S&P 500 High Dividend ETF) is close. It still gives you stock appreciation, but less than SPY, so you can collect dividends as income and still enjoy some capital gains. And its tied to the S&P 500 so you can close your eyes and never look again.

This is either a joke or the sad reflection of WSB. Looks like I’ve found a good short. Timing will be key.
Earnings or lead-up could get dicey, especially since it'll be soon after this wave of enthusiasm tapers some.
Yup, when you don't know something usually you look for people who knows a little more about the subject than you. At some point you stumble across WSB and you come to realisation that their is a running gag about the subreddit. Nevertheless you're not useful, so instead of bothering me, what do you suggest at this moment ? Like I said, started yesterday.
You still have another week
Your boyfriend is going to love  it! Congrats.
Do people think it will actually STAY crashed? If I see a TSLA dip you can bet I’m loading up for the inevitable bounce. This is the biggest argument against a crash right now. Dips are bought up IMMEDIATELY.
I mean, if this squeezes, I could make millions
That could have been my parents IRA, but I sold it at 90 thinking I did very well. 🤦🏽‍♂️😂
Interesting 🤔 Are you Chinese? This seems like a very particular stock to buy, and I'm assuming you're familiar with the product.

Don’t worry man - same boat. Sold for a slight LOSS even, then saw $1200 left on my table. You’re not the only retard ❤️
Are they really gains if you don’t sell though?
I would say most of us in the US are politically homeless. We’re disenfranchised because each side has to move further and further in opposition to one another. The right goes further right and the left more left. Leaving - what? - probably 75% of us who just kind of go “meh” and vote for the lesser of two evils. I really don’t think either party represents the will of most people. We’re all just looking for a shred of happiness every single day and don’t want to be bothered by the constant bickering and arguing between the two sides. And by the way, the arguments and the outrage seem to be becoming... more... what would you call it?... boutique? Like my story on Instagram was littered with people freaking out over “trans violence” - like does anyone even know a trans person? I sure don’t. Most Americans aren’t concerned with these boutique issues. And why should they be? Life sucks for everybody most of the time lol

I remember when TSLA hit 350 pre split and I though I'd missed the boat.  Then at 500 I thought I was an idiot.  Finally started buying at 800 (pre split). Thankfully kept buying and averaging up and down.  Current cost basis is 200 (split adjusted).  But but I should've been loading up with everything under 1k

I am literally opening a “dispensary” in one of the biggest tourist towns in GA. Selling delta 8 and cbd flower/carts/salves etc. if weed becomes federally legal I will b bank rollin
I think that's probably where it belongs. In the 15 - 20 range. Which is why I put the stop loss in when it ran up briefly. Didn't have much faith in it. 

I still don't because 1)Hydrogen is a ways from prime time and given its challenges it may never be prime time. 2)PLUG in particular is focused on small industrial. It's forklifts and go carts in the warehouse not EVs or large generation or anything like that. The deal with SK seems to aim to change this, but it's probably significant investment of both resources and time away and assuming (1) pans out. 

Not believing in it though won't stop me from buying calls to take advantage of the hype train so I may open a small position on a pull back.
Fucking wish I was able to buy more NIO calls. Bought a bunch of shares, but damn I wish I got calls for next week...

Thoughts on fucking autists that can’t communicate or look people in the eyes?
How would there not be pent up demand when the majority of the nation still does not have access to recreational marijuana? Uness I'm mistaken as of the most recent election only about 50% have access to medical marijuana of some form? 

I understand your point by stoners are smoking in illegal states, but a store with hundreds if not thousands of choices is going to generate much more revenue than the local drug guy with 3 choices and some brownies he made a month ago. I wouldn't be interested in investing in retail stores, as those will over time just be corner liquor store equivalent but the growers will always be selling into growing demand, regardless where it's coming from. 

Also, I'm not telling you this is the path to your retirement. I'm saying there are a series of catalysts coming that will absolutely increase the value of marijuana companies and I think people would want to know. 


Also, this is gonna feel good when everything I've said comes true and I can point right back to this post and say "I tried to tell you" when I'm taking all my profits and going to the next thing.
How the fuck do I get into investing I’m sick of seeing this shit I want to be an autist too

Lmao I remember that comment
Haha same man. Love this
Partly sour grapes for missing the boom, but mostly because it is obscenely valued.  

It barely makes money right now, primarily selling renewable energy credits to legacy automakers.  As said legacies expand their EV offerings, they won't need to buy as much/if at all, taking both market share from sales, as well as revenue.  

It's worth more than Facebook, which has an operating margin of 35%.  Legacy luxury automakers have a margin approaching 10% (BMW, market leader).  Tesla's is supposed to approach BMW's this year.  BMW's market cap is ~$60 billion.  TSLA is $860 billion.  

Insane run, and congrats if you made bank.  But take some profits and put money into something else.  Reality is going to catch up with TSLA eventually.

What position did you take in Pltr? I’ve got shares and done a bit of theta on it and done well so far. 

But I know some people bought in at 30 and are hurting rn.

When you have issues, you can email their CEO. That link actually works and he gets things done quickly.
That’s ok... we can be friends again
I like pictures.
Exactly, every other company will simply sit back and let TESLA take all the market share, hence the 800B market cap for TESLA. So it will simply happen again for NIO in China, exactly the reason why it can ONLY go up to Pluto

It got added back and then it was modified in 2010. I’m not 100% about what it constitutes anymore (I personally don’t short/use margin) - but there is plenty of reading about it out there if you want to figure out what counts and when.
Are we too late? It mooned like crazy this week.

What’s happening Thursday?
Not typically who I surround myself with
My issue with production misses is the drive up from the 615ish post-inclusion drop up into the 700s was driven seemingly on Wedbush hyping delivery numbers over 500k. Deliveries came under 500 and it kept running anyway into the 800s. Feels like it needs to be a pretty significant macro factor or prolonged bottoming as you say @ this point.
sounds like my kind of guy

IMO if you’re not getting margin called at least a couple times a year, you’re not truly living

Shouldn’t have a portfolio of more than 10 tickers. 5 or less if you want hyper growth (what I’m doing).
I got 20c 2023 calls at $15, I feel pretty good about those in any spot
Sorry about your boyfriend.
Bears must be plumb retarded to buy puts on TSLA rn. RSI alone is showing maximum retard strength. 

Fun fact: It’s actually a myth that RSI measures overbought oversold. It’s a more a measure of price weakness/strength.
Thanks. I know some people on here seem to FU money, so I wasn’t sure.
What big money?
Really??? Lmfao 🤣  🤣
Huawei is the biggest phone brand in China, not Apple. There’s a chance that NIO, will be the biggest car brand in China, not TESLA. But, NIO + TESLA 🚀🚀🚀

Just checked Redfin, majority of the listings for under $250k in Boston are literally parking spaces and in Boulder they’re for the city’s affordable housing program. Zillow says the typical home value in Boston is $600k and in Boulder it is $800k. For reference, Houston’s is $200k and you can get a nice property essentially anywhere in the city.
Haha congrats and fuck you, I understand tax implications but if you aren’t gonna sell now you are not gonna realize that gain, clock is ticking on the bubble, you better keep one eye on the door, set a stop loss at least
Congratulations, hope it fills in everything you can ever want in life.

And also, fuck you
That’s true but I think with strict regulations and more research into cheaper ways of recycling the waste, it’s not too big of a problem.

I strongly recommend selling lol - remember the WSB way, if it’s good enough to screenshot its good enough to sell. Which is why I never post screenshots 😂
Yes and you don't lose, you just miss potential gains if they expire ITM. if they don't, you repeat. Lowers your cost basis each time they expire worthless.

It's all assumptions, all a hypothetical scenario.

10 million cars a year is 35% CAGR from here. Doable.. maybe, maybe not. They'll need to keep building more factories to keep up with it and growth could fall off a cliff with increased competition.

Gross profit was around 20%, net profit will likely be low single-digits but let's suppose it's 5% net, average sale price around $60k, then we have $30B profit. $600B revenue. For scale - Toyota has around $250B of revenue.

See how this is really, really stretching? Is there a market for 10M luxury cars, can they really hit much larger net profit margin than other automakers? One slow year can throw this all off.

Even with these outlandish assumptions (10M cars, $3k profit/car), I'd put net present value at $300B, and you get a measly 8% return from that. Kind of shit, really. 

To be fair at $800B today, they need to sell about 20M annually in 10 years. If margins are cut ($25k car they're planning).. that might be more like 30M cars.
If I had tits they'd go up for this
That's what I was thinking, the price difference between 2022 and 2023 LEAPs is pretty small.   Thinking of picking up some 2023 LEAPs at the highest strike available.   If they pull off the solid state battery and improve production without sacrificing quality and get into expansion outside of China, they could be a serious contender in the auto market and potentially beyond.
Is this still something people believe?

As of friday information is out that BABA wont get delisted
if it loses 10-20% pretty rapidly, I could see a snowball effect where it doesn't bottom out for a while. also if it misses on production or revenue any time soon, it will be absolutely fucking blasted.
Awesome. Thank you!

I was a little greedy but I really didnt expect it to go up over 100$ in the last week.

anything over 20% is a crash

20% wouldn't be 20%. People are so overextended on TSLA that if it dropped 20%, it would be an avalanche all the way to like $250

In my area I could not buy a house and retire on that unfortunately.  I’m in a high cost of living area. But it could get me a house paid for.
I mean just think about. Would you have dumped your life savings into a then meme stock? Imagine dumping 100k into PLTR right now. And then, after it doubled, or even tripled, would you still have held instead of selling?
Genuinely curious, do you actually need this money or was it for shits and giggles?

The “bullet train” is nothing more than a regular speed choo choo designed to feed money to the unions that bribe the legislature.
If you go deep deep deep in the money, the spread will kill you. Otherwise there is very little extrinsic value.
However, considering that the price might correct over the next few months, selling a deep itm call option will secure profits.
Let's say the $750 call 2/26. Extrinsic will be about $40 per call, however if the shares were to drop to 755 in the next 6 weeks, he'd still be holding the same value. Like an insurance policy. If it drops below 750, then he gets to keep the shares + mitigated his losses. 
Depends all on his strategy, regardless I'm sure he will start selling otm call options at some point to generate extra income. Could make an easy $55k per week with a.30 delta
Damn, I'm a bit jealous 🤣

Well when I only had $3000 I was way too much of a pussy to invest half of what I had in anything, but regardless your average cost suggests you’ve had way more than I had at the time to invest.

Well if you're hoping TSLA will drop back to below 330....  you might be MORE insane than the people that think It'll cross 1000.

Yeah, other drugs have much better margins than competing with legal businesses. Does it happen? Sure. Are those markets expanding in legal states? I doubt it.

Unfortunately cartels are notorious for lying on their earnings reports, and people think they know it's booming because some other person said so. Who also actually knows nothing.

If you want to keep your shares, sell at a strike price that is semi-unrealistic. If you are in it for a short term jump sell the calls 3-4% above the current price and you either get maximum profit or you get premium to cover any losses. If you have any questions you can DM me. I just figured it all out a few months ago.

There are two Americas and we will make it or die trying
You don't want to hear this, but please sell. The probability of you losing everything at this point is significantly greater than the probability of you making more. You're already at the tail-end of returns: take the win.

If I told you that the probability of Tesla losing 90% of its value is greater than the probability of it doubling, would you sell? If your position fell back to $100k and took a decade to recover, would you be content? Like I said above, the probability $TSLA depreciating is significantly higher than the probability of it appreciating (this isn't to say it **won't** increase, just that it is unlikely). But you have a 100% chance of making $2M.

Take the win, for your own sake.
There’s 4 divisions in the AFC and It used to be that only the top 2 teams get byes and the bottom two division winners play the two wild card teams. They announced (I think before covid happened?) that now only the top 1 team will get the bye and there are now 3 division winners that play against 3 wild cards. Either way the Steelers would’ve been playing vs. a wild card team this year because they were not a top 2 team in the AFC (chiefs and bills would have gotten the byes)
If you’re scared of a crash just put all your money in CCL. What’s it gonna do, go back to $9 again?

Let's say they hit 10 million cars in 10 years, $3,000 profit per car. $30 billion profit, ok not bad.

20x P/E would put them around $600 billion... IN 10 YEARS. Closer to $800B right now. Discounting 8% annually you're overvalued by $500B.

Any hiccup along the way and it's tanking. Margin gets cut, flat sales in the US, VW kills it in the EV space.

I wish I could share a photo but I don’t know how. But I used what’s called a Fibonacci retracement (it’s a tool in probably any charting software). I don’t know how familiar you guys are with this but basically “Fibonacci” is a phenomena, mathematical formula that appears in nature. And it also appears in the financial markets. Most charting software should have a “Fibonacci retracement” tool. You use it to draw a line from bottom to top on a continuous move up and it reveals certain levels below and above the top point. And then when the stock “pulls back” or retraces, the tools will tell you at what level the stock retraced to. And the stock land usually right on the money on one of the retracement levels. And the tool also has an extension level at the top that tells you because the stock retraces to THIS level the next move UP is to THIS level. PLTR did a big move up before what it’s doing now which is kind of dancing around. But it has also pulled back from the old high. And it retraced right down to the .618 retracement level. And therefore the next move up is to the 1.618 extension on the fib tool. And the price at that extension level is $44.20. But guys you should know that anything could happen. There could be a slew of bad news that takes the market down next week and the trade becomes “broken”. All these levels tell you that if everything goes as usual, it will get to the next level over time. I have no idea how long. It could take much longer than we think. But odds are it will get to that level. I made $600 on a trade on TLRY this past week from getting in at a Fibonacci pull back. And the next move up hit my target perfectly at the extension of the fib. This is just one strategy though. There are others. And it doesn’t always fulfill. But it USUALLY does. So don’t take it as an absolute. But it’s definitely one I use.

Nah, it'll go like the tariffs. Biden wouldn't delist BABA in the first place, but won't let them back in unless they meet the normal reporting and audit requirements for foreign listed companies.

It's not a principled stance on whether there should be tariffs depending on reporting practices, it's negotiating from an anchor of the status quo, and basically the same "what can I get" strategy of Trump minus the bull-in-a-China-shop (sorry) tactics.

I won't post details of my thesis because we shouldn't help the shorts in anyway. They need to stay short.

Share price and market cap is not a direct link. They might issue shares or buy back shares down the road. I think in the end the total shares will reduce.

U still got a lot of fucking left to do. About ~5k left to get fucked.

Much, props on your investment. That took a lot of balls to put in that much cash. 

So wouldn't take any profits at all?
Truly Shakespearian
Anyone who has lost their life savings in GME bought FD's, in which case they wouldve lost it all anyways on some other stock because they're making retarded plays. The stock hasn't dipped enough to delete savings either unless you're selling every dip and buying every peak

Im here trying to figure out what this trade is. Then I remembered its not just options.
Lol no way man. It’d be the second or third most valuable car company in the WORLD with only like 44k cars sold last year? No fucking way.
also wouldn't 15k x 4 = 60k? x2 for mom = 120k ..

Watched an abbreviated version of Nio Day. Not completely impressed. 

The biggest takeaway: lengthy timeframe to execute their technologies 

It will be approx 2 years until the new battery comes out. The battery technology is on steroid mode, industry wide. By then, Tesla and the EV industry will be on par at minimum or ahead. It appears Nio is leveraging "time" (years) to make their narrative appear more robust. 

Also, the Nio sedan is available in 1 year and still pricey even with subsidiaries.

Lidar is a questionable technology in autonomous driving and Nio going this route is maybe risky? The good news: Nio will be partnering with NVDA. And the CCP, an even better partner, will not let them fail.

But don't take it from me. Here's another recap

first of all congrats and fuck you.

i would sell 1M + enough to cover taxes so you can fuck around with a clean 1M and ride the rest. You'd still have enough to be a multimillionaire if TSLA continues to moon and potentially a lot of capital (assuming you don't spend half in hookers) to re-enter if it dips.

No question, in my opinion. But February is an interesting choice. My calls are 1/15 and 1/2022.

 I made bets on the Senate race first for 1/15 in case the results were dragged out. I maybe should of let those go the day following the election, but I 💎🙏 that bitch and let me just say: so far that was retarded. I still feel really really good about my $10 CRON calls, but my $35 CGC calls are gonna need a rally like only seen in south. I feel like a lot of people were closing their positions ITM for their 1/8 calls, which is why we didn't see much growth Thursday and Friday. I'm hoping to growth M-W and will probably close my positions before market close on Wednesday and purchase shares with whatever I take in on the calls. 

Then Thursday comes around and Biden completely ignored marijuana at JP Morgan, or he says literally anything and stocks go 🔥🔥🔥. My calls for 1/2022 will look great, but I'm holding those until 48-72hrs after the banking bill passes to also convert those into shares to ride out the wave into decriminalization, national medical marijuana, and finally full legalization. 

I can't wait to make a 💎🙏 post in 2025 when the industry is ROARING.

It is pricey, but overpriced? Nah. I'd need some assurance that you are more qualified to analyze TSLA price than Cathie Wood or Chalmath Palihapitiya, those closer to the EV gods perhaps than us mere mortals. I'm waiting to see if any short term event (like today's NIO day) has any material impact but I'm not losing any sleep. TSLA is capable of competing. Elon Musk no longer tweets out opinions on price or ownership (thank God) so I think in the near term we'll see Tesla sell some more shares and then another split, possibly split before shares are sold.

The better looking cars are heavier and the battery, which is the most expensive part, would have to be beefier. 

The cheap EVs look like crap because they need to be small and extra aerodynamic. They use a relatively cheap battery set $15,000 to $20,000. 

Tesla makes luxury mid and large cars. They have a good range. They have expensive batteries and that’s why they cost a pretty penny.

Great that it's announced, but realistically how much will a sedan like this cost. I would think that if something gets this much range than it should cost a lot with it too? With high price would come low sales right?

Not sure of the magnitude of the pullback oh but it’s coming.  On Friday it not only set a new all time high but if you also count the deep in the outstanding deep in the money warrens they are just a few percentage points away from the $1T market cap & on top of that also set a new consecutive daily winning streak of 11 days.  Last record was in April 10 days followed by 2 down days adding to just over 10% in the red.

I'd totally take some of that and running to live a nice life.  Even if it's just cashing out 200k of it.  I'd be able to live the next 10 years off that without even breaking a sweat.  Granted if you bought 157k in tesla before you clearly aren't poor or part of the "common folk" anyways.

Agreed. WSB promotes extreme risk. There’s nothing wrong with diversifying and buying solid dividend payers to offset the incredibly low yields bonds kick off. Plenty of great companies out there, like McDonalds, Pepsi, J and J, et al., that have great financials and pay a steady, above average dividend.

As an owner of their cars back when the share price was $50 (accounting for stock split) who never jumped in because I knew it would tank the second I did, I have to say all these posts are tempting me.
All hail...
Canada’s shithole
I saw that too and thought the same thing. You cant forget that earning are at the end of the month and earnings are going to be massive with huge profits. Which will be the catalyst to knock them out of patter and allow them to continue on. Got share bought on margin and might grab some yolo calls. 

Also watch Microsoft. Same case for them, ascending triangle with huge earnings at eom that could knock them up and out.
It's like I went back to August 2020 with TSLA in every post.
This bubble won't be popping until they slow delivery growth. That could be 4-5 years down the line.
Look up clayton valley project and find all the dicks associated with that shit and whatever batterie place is next to tesla. Microvast is it?

But for those who can: iron phosphate are already the bulk of production and nickel is reserved for high capacity use cases (semis, higher-end vehicles, etc.)
okay thanks for the insights... lets see how it plays out by then, I will keep holding because its shares and i dont might holding it for years
It's a way of life.
We all get our feet wet, somehow...Have some fun...
Most IPO’d companies will fail. Any kind of economic uncertainty will send the stock to sub $8 levels. Considering that it IPO’d during a holiday season and while markets were inflated, I would say good luck... Another thing worth considering is how the greater majority of the population will use the money to pay for rent, insurance, and food. The smarter covid play would be to buy into insurance companies like AIG, Geico, or State Farm.
WHAT IF

I’m higher than bat pussy right now.

What if Tesla is rising and amazon is dumping because this is the GREEN stock of choice for the sharks and we’re watching the sectors being shifted into the future?
Exactly. Preparing my body and my bank account.

Who the fuck is going to buy an car that they need to drive to a garage to get their battery swapped? Is it really expected that nio will build this clunky and expensive infrastructure? What happens if you go to the nio garage for battery swap and some asshole who came in before you just got the last one?.. like some giant vending machine

I don’t get the viability that nio has.

Also,  I was able to catch the news of Manchin saying that using TD ameritrade news flow. But I wasn't able to catch the news that it might have been overblown. What did you use to find that piece of news right way?
You didn't watch it. 

He was hired as a Tesla analyst by Jim Cramer. Wouldn't call him random, and he called it on Tesla long before these institutions did. 

If you don't get how lowering already the cheapest batteries by 56% + the most advanced auto manufacturing + excellent software can all equal $1 trillion, well, you don't deserve to make money on the stock.
Take a shit on a blank canvas and allow to dry. Call an art appraiser and offer him $5K to appraise the piece at $2M. Donate the masterpiece by "unknown artist" to a gallery. Bingo Blamo, welcome to the upper middle class.
This is how you know the market has gone full retard. Making a Chinese EV company that sells 17k cars the second biggest car company in the world cause why not 250 pt.

Wtf is FSD? I'm all in btw

Might be a bubble but if I get an EV it'll be a Tesla.  Not bc I want an EV so bad or to suck Elon's dick, but bc of the self driving feature.

Automakers can make all the EVs they want but people get sold big time on the self driving feature.  If you live in a traffic heavy city it's a godsend.
Yes
I am happy to take the gf off your hands given she’s already looking bruh

Post your puts
Tesla holders, are you going to get neuralink implanted in your brains ?
If you think that, it would make a lot more sense to just buy puts on SPY (longer dated will benefit more from vol spike if it does happen)... VXX is not the same thing as VIX (read up on how it functions differently before pissing your money away) and the market can go down without volatility spiking enough to get you ITM.
I've only got 2 calls. If Monday is as sweet as we all hope, I may sell 1 call for profit and keep the other till exp. and see what happens.
It's not bad this year even
Put it on a margin account. Buy blue chips.  Use the gains from those to pay the capital gains tax.  

Or just pony up and sell it and pay the taxes.   If it dropped to about $705 or a 20% correction, that is the same as selling now and paying the 20% tax. 

Or don’t take my advice and if it hits $705, you now have $1,380,000 in stock with a $157,000 cost basis and $1,223,000 of unrealized gains and still have taxes  of $250,000 still to pay.  You will wish you sold high and pay the taxes. 

Don’t be greedy, Unless you have fuck you type money.  Shit happened like this in 1999.  

Even Mark Cuban sold for a lot of gains if you look at his story 20 years ago. You don’t get many shots in life like this year with Tesla.

Not too much you can do for options outside of that. Profit is profit. If you want to be cheeky you can hedge your long-term stuff with the short term account to write off hedges that expire worthless
Sadly not. When there is a big surge in supply, the stock goes down, and it gives a bearish vibe (especially if the stock has a good run up before). The bearish vibe causes more people to sell and further drag down the stock.
Look at the history of new IPO, most of them trade below opening price after 180 days. Exception for this are companies who already went down a lot post IPO (all 🐻 already sold so the bearish vibe isn’t as powerful)

I think this is different. Maybe the market won’t react. We’ll see Monday.
With the market above pre-pandemic levels, that's slim pickings. 

Energy could be an interesting option, ET is well below March levels and has done a lot to clean up their balance sheet. Oil is on the way up in the short term, and ET has more exposure to natural gas which is much less at risk from green energy.

I've been holding shares for a long time - their value has been sideways, but the dividends are so fat I don't mind.
Market makers will buy it back to create liquidity or close initial short position. They don’t care about loosing that much since they’re balancing their Greeks

You basically need the stock price to double in a week to profit. I would say 50-50 chance. Good luck!
Once in a lifetime opp.  I was thetaganged in positions and didn't want to close them prematurely.  But maybe this year congress will extend the provisions.
I can't believe the local airport is going bankrupt. It's kinda ridiculous that a city of 300k will have to drive 4 hours to the closest airport. Fuck Covid.

What Tesla call did you buy for $600
the data itself is 1k yearly. AWS and heroku fees eat me monthly too. I like to plot IV to see how it effects the price, but you can play around with it however you want!
"dividends"
No, just delete the app.
TSLA opened on Monday at $719. A 20% drop from here would be about $705. Close enough

I would double down on, “inverse anything this guy says.” Better pick up leverage for the unforeseen circumstances. There are a lot of events between now and December that makes it ripe for a bear market even with inflation.
But then didn’t say a month before earnings that they were going to release it early. They did release it early but didn’t signal it.
Relax bro you seem on edge
Meh we’ll see.

Do you really see icln going to $50-60 by next year?
You should backtest that with last quarter's earnings and save yourself some money

YouTube isn't too bad of a starting place. Trading SPX has some tax efficiencies for short term options but the majority of the tax benefits are going to be routing trades through tax-sheltered accounts. Best to keep your long term long and your short term in separate accounts
Put buyers lost money, call sellers didn't make as much money. No one went broke taking profits. You also get stock movement up to your strike.

You can if your brokerage allows for OTC trading. The companies are legit and filed with the SEC, but are generally more risky and may require slight premiums through your broker.

Even on 0DTE, out of the money contracts increase in price with the underlying. So yes at exp, they’ll be worthless but during the day they’ll be up.

Look at TSLA on Friday. Massive IV and outperformed the expected move every day of the week. If you bought $900c on Thursday and sold Friday at noon, you’d have a multi bagger. Six hours later they’re worthless. It’s an expensive game of hot potato essentially.

What would you recommend feb or jab
That's one way to look at it. Another way is that they're looking to temper expectations for some reason. They might try to mitigate the damage of poor sales by focusing on...wait for it...omnichannel or whatever buzzword they learned this week.


Really doesn't matter. If it's a good report and they're on track to blow us all away, great. Fire up the rockets and let's go. If it sucks, fine, fire the CEO and bring in the dog whisperer.

Serious question. What is the best resource to learn about strategies to pay the least possible amount in taxes on gains from options? I’ve seen many strategies discussed. But I don’t see them all compared very often. I will definitely seek out a professional when the time comes. But I’d like to gain some knowledge on the subject.

He still holds the title of president. Why do you think they want to impeach him ... again... days before his term is done? To strip him of the protection presidency and ensure he never runs again. The list of illegal shyt this man has done while in office is long ... and documented. If you think he will continue  on as if nothing has happened you are ..... probably  ot that bright.

You have a point... but Amazon is literally everywhere in people’s life. Understandable the valuation and potential. The reach of Tesla into peoples life’s is only so much.
Very cool.  How much does that run you for the data feed?  How do you personally use it to place bets?

They can only sell 15% on Day 1. Second expiration is after Q4 earning (another 15%). Last expiration is 180 days, employees can sell the rest and early investors, executives can sell too. This will contribute to the most drop since early investors hold lots of shares and they usually exit so they can chase the next unicorn. Even though there are some exceptions, most stocks go down around lockup expiration because of the sudden surge in supply.
ICLN is good. Possibly Steel as well.
Holy fuck. A $5K call for Amazon in July has a $2200 price on it. What a lovely CC scenario

How the fuck should I know? It will go up if the market stays irrational but the point is that there’s plenty of other plays that will go up WAY more in an irrational market. Once the nonexistent bubble pops AAPL is coming down with everything else
Yeah until it goes up 1% and all you fools jump all over it like a crack head whore!!

If the average joe can afford a 25-30k Camry days, they will be able to get Tesla and will pick that over other cars. The government giving a 5k tax credit to EV cars will help get more Tesla's sold than any car GM or Ford will ever make

Hello brother. It's tough, not much liquidity in the leaps so I'm having to pay close to ask on those
GM, Tesla and VW are all tech companies. So is Siemens and GE and Maersk and BP and UPS and Nike and whatever company you want to name. Almost every company is a technology company these days, because they need to be.

Unless you sell milk from a corner shop you need to be a technology company, because your competition is.


What most of those companies *not* are however, is software companies!

And what do you need for a self driving car? 

Of course you need sensors and mqtt based edge computing and all that jazz, but mainly, you need the software that can understands reality and can drive a car.

And that is where Tesla falls short: they just dog have the talent.
I think it’s both a stimulus play and a covid play. Wish has had increasing revenue year over year prior to covid, so I don’t think it’s correct to say they’re only profiting off of Amazon’s ability to meet increased demands caused by covid. Additionally, wish had its own supply chain issues when covid first started due to most of its merchants being located in China. Obviously, this isn’t a good thing, I’m just disputing your point on Amazon. 

In terms of the current volatility, Wish is a long term play for me as I said, but I think last week provided good entries, and I think next week will as well as it is still well below IPO price.
Personally? I'd do only ARKG. Throw 150k into shares and throw the other 50k on deep itm leaps

I turned 4k to 14k with PLTR, then 14k to 30k with APXTW, then 30k to 58k with ICLN options. 
Yeah shares are quite possible but I find that unless if you're planning to hold a stock for more than a year it's quite pointless to buy the shares than to just leverage on options

In that same scenario $13000 in options would give $12,800 @ $6.40 premium = 20 contracts of 100 shares  


If the price made $140 it would be $1.60 x 20 x 100 = $3200.  


For the sake of my understanding if earnings was next week hypothetically looking at apple calls 137c 1.55 premium 22nd Jan for the same amount of money $12,800, I'd have 82 contracts, if the price reaches $140 I'd make £145 per contract = $11,890.  


What would be my options here in terms of playing this, if it gets to $140 I obvs take the shares at 137 and sell them, what happens if it's not looking like it will reach $137 or more, am I just fucked?  


Say the price is $136 on 21st Jan, can I sell the option again and make money or would I just get cucked?

What are you on about? Tesla did what literally every other car company also can do. I had in Audi in 2007 that had active lane assistent, and obviously speed control.

It's just not other company was greedy enough to sell this as a *NEW* feature.. Because it is not enough to develop into a fully self driving car or robo cabs.

And every company was so scared of going out of business if being caught lying to their customers like that that they didn't do that.

Tesla will find out the hard way that. They won't be able to offer robo cabs with this technology. And what then?

Its been said to death, but sell weekly or monthly calls. If u get called, u can buy in again. If u r itm u can roll up and out This way u protect downside, generate cash gains, and u can set a trailing stop to lock in your returns. If u have margin enabled, this will allow u to double ur position with a buy stop at or near ur call option strike so u dont have to worry about missing a run.
This is kind of like crucifying heretics on the road to Rome as a message to the others.

Yeah I agree but a major issue of going green is mass adoption of EVs. Tesla's are simply too expensive for the average Joe to afford. How many AVERAGE people drive a luxury car like the ones you mentioned? Buying a $1000 phone is much different than buying a $30-50k car. 

I'm not say GM cars are superior in any way, because they are not. But thinking everyone can afford a Tesla is extremely unrealistic. I see the government supporting EV companies that can produce an affordable EVs more than luxury ones.

50% to off planet exploration and 50% to Earth rehab.

What does Musk think about a holding company?

He's stated that he thinks that an "X" holding company is a "good idea."

Not sure if I can dumb it down any further than that.
yup, I have 3000 shares in the high 17's DCA, only down about $400 overall, overall cost about the same as yours

Thanks for playing though

Funny you say that because that’s exactly what I was wondering Friday. Never tried it before.

which other plays are you thinking?
I'd buy your point when talking about habitual users, and specifically smokers. 

However you're over looking the market of people wanting to try THC without inhaling smoke. If I say "hey drink this" and hand you a branded bottle from a brand you know (Corona) you're much more likely to give it a shot than to rip a bong. Or eat whatever travesty the local drug dealer has cooked up with butter made from trim.

Fuck me dude. That's bad. I think your only hope to recoup some of that is to play the Buy the rumor, sell the news. They're gonna pump it before that ICR event on the 11th. Ride it up til about 3pm on the 11th, then sell before market close on that day as it will likely dump the following morning. You did not lose everything and there is hope for you to rebuild. Next time don't invest in a company that's going the way of blockbuster and remember these forums are full of scammers. Be careful man.

Wish isn’t a stimulus play. Wish is a covid play related to Amazon’s inability to supply 100% of people’s needs. The thing that has been driving up Wish’s price is bond yields. 10yr basis points reached 1.15 on Friday and dropped below 1.08 for a few minutes. The price volatility you saw is what happens when bond rates and yields change so dramatically. 10yr bond yields went from .9-1.1 in 2 weeks. Check your 2 week charts.

Decades ago the local ISP/phone company discovered some legal loophole to not being deemed a monopoly (while effectively being a monopoly).  

Prices for Cable Inet have been expensive.  Around 60 dollars a month for a 15 Mpbs connection.  And the only option in town.

Last year the Power company decided to run their own fiber and startup their own ISP.  Low and behold now the Cable company has suddenly decided to remove the data caps from our accounts and double our bandwidth at no additional charge.

Funny how that works...

Apologies I've not written that well, what I meant is that given that Stan had announced towards the end of Dec that results were a couple of weeks away, saying that results are expected in early Feb would imply a delay.

fucking eh I thought my 4.5k on Friday was sick, can't imaging 100\* that
Yes. If you own 100 shares you sell to open. Value of covered calls is you make the premium whenever you strike isn't hit at close.  The only downside is you 'miss' out on some upside.

Morons will keep buying TSLA shares, but it will drop and drop.

People will say fuck it and pull out and jump on NIO / NVDA.

JNJ gets you 2.5% at the current price with its dividend. If they default it means the USA has already burned to the ground.
The dot com bubble was caused by a lot of companies with no profit and even not business plan. Money was poured on anyone with a domain.

The proper companies from back then are still around and many dominate.

We may be in a bubble but it's absolutely not the same thing. At all.
Yeah I agree 100% but what's stopping them from converting their better looking models to EVs? I know they already half-stepped towards that direction by offering hybrid options of their popular cars, and I think even a few truck models.

Tesla just simply doesn't have the right priced car that your average Joe can afford nor does it have the capacity to manufacture a shit ton of cars.

Not that I'm a Tesla bear though because they're dope as fuck.

Problem with weed is the black market. Most of the dudes who were doing it before it was semi legal didn't stop. They can undercut the legal market with cheaper weed since they don't pay taxes.

Batteries can be modularized into chunks. When a battery manufacturer sells you (1000kW) for an ev its not exactly that amount. So they can have 10/20/30kWh chunks they add up to make the right one. A battery swapping station only needs to know in advance. Don’t get me wrong, its not something that has been done before but scalability is not a issue. I think its more about how easily can the consumer use it like gas stations (petrol pumps) which are available easily.
It’s a tech mobility brand company. Pretty revolutionary honestly. No one knows how it ends but it sure is different approach to things. Institutions have been buying it steadily up into the 45-48 range not sure how much buying they’re willing to do up here. Wait for pullback and buy the dip with confidence anything in the 40’s

I agree with most of what you're saying in principle, and honestly, at the end of the day, how can we measure a nuclear meltdown once every 50 years versus thr daily contamination (that most people are blissfully unaware of) that results from coal production?  I dont know.  But I do want to counter that nuclear waste from accidents isnt always safely contained forever.  Japan, for instance, wants to dump theirs from Fukushima into the ocean, now - to the ire of ecologists, obviously.
You just need to actually do some planning this time for your next 10 bagger.
Hmmm
I would probably put 200k in FDs and then lose it and then 200k more lose that too, and repeat until I had 100k and I would just withdraw it

"Envious", of course. What man wouldn't like 1.9milly to spend on the kids and missus.

1 of 2 things is the case here.

1 - this is utter BS and you're full of shit.

2 - this is legit, and you're bragging to strangers on the Internet about it... 😂 and you're being a right cunt about it... sad mate.

Good luck with your stock trading, quit whilst you're ahead lad.
Why not 3500? Would make an equal amount of sense.

SWBI might be the worst possible popular company to buy options on. Close competition between it and RKT.
Bad idea. why fight the printer when you could be riding the weed and clean energy train to tendietown?
I hit 1.5 and still going, though mostly in SPAC warrants including OAC and DM YD
You’re desperate
OP just wants to persuade others to sell or short TSLA. He won't take a large short position.

I'm very bearish on NIO for longer term, but I won't post anything. Why ruin other people's party? I noticed some long term TSLA bears recently are going long NIO. I think they will lose big time again if they keep holding.

I'm super long TSLA and wouldn't lose sleep if I move my entire portfolio into TSLA at the current price. Stocks can have pullbacks from time to time. My long term view is TSLA has another 5\~15 fold gain coming. It could come fast.
I shit you not I had Tesla calls and sold them for 2k profit instead of 214k profit
Here take my upvote

Depends on the energy company. Every company has a strategy group that keep up to date with the trends and we are already in the renewable business. It is smaller than the rest of our pipelines business but we are competitively large enough enough that we have funds to grow and transition the green energy business.

A lot of posters on Reddit and social media sites will post and have bots give themself tons of awards to make it more marketable. The video was made 2+ years ago and it’s almost like the creator was calling Reddit out directly.      

I’ve always been skeptical of anything posted on Reddit, especially when someone has skin in the game after a long run up as that can mean they are trying to pump their position as they dump. Go back into my comment history and you will see me consistently correctly calling out people with skin in the game.

Very nice
I was looking at it too, until I saw 800b market cap
Yeah.

At least recoup your starting investment plus some.

If you withdraw 200k now. You can at least say “I made 100% on 100k in 1 year”, even if Elon gets arrested for fraud on Tuesday
Delete and reinstall. Seems to work.

Edit: Pleas fly again.
This is mostly true
Well, on a positive note you won’t have to pay taxes for a long time.
Is this in a 401k? 

I'd def sell out around 1/2 of it and let the rest ride. Even if this is like one of those old 1990's Amazon or Microsoft tech bubble highs, in 20 years when you actually need to money for your wet nurse it will have recovered. 

The arc of Elon is slow and steady progress towards the his company's goals. I don't doubt they will be the largest auto manufacture, eventually. Look at how bad Toyota is fucking up their EV transition by starting so late, and they have billions to burn. Then look at how many other brands are straight screwed with their late to the party goals of 2025-2030 for more EVs not even 50% EVs, just "more EVs" (FCA-Stellantis, Subaru, Honda, Mazda, JLR).
Idk sounds bullish
Thanks and fuck you too.  What if it goes to $1000??
People are just excited by the fact that everyone is making money. Can you blame them? Heck just believe in Musk and all will be provided for

This is the most retarded thing I have read here in forever.  Best of luck to you.

You give no reason for being bearish.  In the very short term this might work out. dems control everything the money printer is going to go brrrrrrr.  Most likley slv will be flat for a while, your zsl will decay, and your puts won't print. Then after your puts expire, slv will finally fall, but zsl will spike but not even enough to make it back to breakeven.

Why not sell put spreads on SLV and use the premium to buy calls on ZSL?
I only want to buy companies that lose money
I don't see why people think the market is going down gotta reduce my lossess hurr and not just wait a week or two let them bounce back or at least correct in a good manner.

It’s not what they say it’s what they do.. I think you’re slightly overestimating the governments ability to work efficiently for the greater good.. I’m calling immediate term agenda directed at things like pursuing criminal charges and putting out fires relating to oncoming social unrest from economic conditions worsening through winter months.. eventually we’re getting universal basic income and money will print but we still need to be brought down to our knees one last time.. reality hasn’t hit, and when it does, it will provide justification of $3T packages but I don’t see make up budging in the same manner media and market, career interested figures propagate.. it’s almost they know just saying it keeps it propped up a bit.. BD came on Friday right when things were actually kind of starting to slide a bit.. I sold off winners and went short and he got on the TV.. this isn’t a free market we’re playing in.. whenever I think I’m about to catch a short mnuchin or some other pawn gets on the tv and spews out some BS and bids come in..

I've talked about this before but I think we are few years from it being forced by the Supreme Court as it has ruled very close to this in the past.

> ... noting that ownership "does not always mean absolute dominion." The court pointed out that the more an owner opens his property up to the public in general, the more his rights are circumscribed by the statutory and constitutional rights of those who are invited in.

No, everyone knew a flash crash would happen back in the latter half of 2019, and a lot of extremely wealthy people sold out prior to the Jan-February squeeze before the collapse. Go back to the news articles prior to the release of covid.

Also, send me your transcript for your prestigious business school. I’d love to see it.
Lots of people bought call options this week. With the full population slowly getting their $600 stimulus checks in, the expected price the shares will hit is $1400 (per this user, I don't know if that's actually accurate).
Just turn your phone on and off, that usually fixes it

Each stock is different and the really bad ones often try to lure investors in with really high dividends.  Coca-Cola yields a little over 3% in dividends a year, and it's a pretty safe and stable stock, but they get up over 10% I think, for the really risky ones.

except they won't come out with a 25k car soooo

The gain is not even 100%, this mofo put 2.5M on tesla at 482... retarded.
compelling argument.

you probably thought TSLA would gap up on battery day and cybertruck day too.
Gotcha. Top is in then
200k, want to put it in maybe ARKK, ARKG or 50/50. Don't want to look at it. Shares or Leaps?
I did when it hit 882
I will as soon as it has a -5% day

I would say 75-80 anything more is overvalued. Every time it hits 80 I sell and reload when it goes to 75. Ez $$
You did what I couldn't i literally had 150k in cash in March and the wife wouldn't let me put it all in TSLA.  On my calculation I'd have 1.5million today. At an avg cost of 84.00.  If I bought on the day i wasnt allowed to buy.

Because $13000 of shares can return maybe $1000. $13000 in options can return $130000 on an OTM weekly. This isn’t an r/investing play. It’s high risk high reward.
With Dem controlled government, this will be one of their first priorities. I expect Biden to say something about this as soon as he’s sworn in and things passed in the next month or so.

LMFAOO I KNEW I WAS GONNA GET SOME BULLSHIT. At least my flair has Cathie in it 😏
If tesla comes out with a 25k car, I think they're market cap will be over 2-3T. Everyone can afford a 25k car. And it will be so much better than any honda or toyota in that price range. EV's have really nice acceleration, better driver experience and lower maintainance costs. Pretty soon, everyone will be on a 300/month Tesla payment plan just like how everyone is able to buy an iphone 12 pro max for 50 per month. My price target is 3k.
Just killed someone on WARZONE named Elon, puts on my portfolio

You do realize China is well known to bring people in and then straight up copy their designs and make a factory in a different region and start pumping the same model as quickly as they can build the plant.

GM learned the hard way. China did it to them in the city over.

I disagree, NIO will gap up. And I don’t have any skin in the game
Your argument is to protect against the 1% chance of something happening that has a less than 1:1000 payout ratio. My argument is that it’s more profitable to be right more often with a higher ceiling. I’m not insulting you, and I would like to point out that if you have a specific type of trading license, you have to tell people who your initial broker is when asked. I believe refusal can mean a revocation of licensing even on an anonymous social media account. Based on how you took my last comment, I’m going to assume you do have a job in the finance industry screwing people over. In which case, good luck and I hope your company sells me naked options(highly unlikely but I would love for you to bet against me).

Congrats man. But you really should take action. Stating the obvious, as stocks grow your up potential decreases and the risk of dropping increases. Nevertheless, this is especially true for Tesla right  now. You’re practically having a huge position for smaller and smaller gains with increasing risks. I would sell 40% and hedge 30% by selling calls.

Best of luck!
The shitposts that will come out of the $RBLX listing next month will be legendary

what makes you think NIO moons?
Prob too late for tsla so id go amzn for earnings run up
who’s Janet? I need to expand on it clearly all the comment criticisms are just saying they want more lol
Too many people yelling top for it to actually be a top.  Feels a lot like 2018.
Ahh yes, taxing capital gains slightly higher will cause grandma to starve. You're fucking retarded.
not really, no

just based on him probably not having much time to spend with them
Noooo
I teach 6th grade, it really is a fascinating age. They change pretty rapidly, I like being a part of the positive change and getting them on a good track
I think you're playing it right, I don't see TSLA going down (I think rather than a correction it'll have longer periods of trading sideways to compensate) and I own NIO over TSLA because I don't have the kind of cash to buy or feel comfortable buying TSLA until it at least slows down. Not to say that I'm not genuinely bullish on NIO, I think they'll be the top of chinese EV makers, but I want as much as I can get of both when I can afford it.

Someone at work has covid, working at home is back on the menu
When is he gonna pump it ?
Market has already looked past the point where ZM was relevant dude.

We're literally setting covid records every day while ZM dumps. Back in the spring they would drop the CA/TX covid numbers every day; the market would tank and ZM would pump. Now the CA numbers are like 3x as bad as the spring and market keeps selling ZM. Narrative has just changed. Can something change and the market suddenly start caring about Covid again? Sure. But until that happens, IF EVER, ZM is a losing bet.

You gotta just keep focused on price, not what you think will happen or what you want to happen. Right now price is saying ZM isn't a buy.
That's an 80% loss

I think lumping Tech into 1 basket is too broad. Big Tech (Google, FB, etc) are facing monopoly pushback recently. Tesla and other EV companies are looking pretty overvalued. But, AI is still underdeveloped, as well as other emerging tech.

So there are multiple catalysts in tech that can swing individual stock wildly in 2021 and 2022 (depending on how much money the FED brrrrrrs, and for how long), but there's still growth in some tech. 

TLDR: Buy GME and PLTR

Lmao Godspeed brother
lol that there is sub for the ticker
I only own shares at the moment so the bit I am a noob, but why buy call options when the premium is so high is why not just buy shares?

Perhaps a stupid question but if I think Apple will reach say $140 in Feb after earnings if I buy 100 shares at spot which is $132 then it costs me $13,200 dollars. If it then rises to $140 I'd make $800 profit when I sold the shares.

If I purchased 1 contract $132.00c Feb 12, 2021 and the premium is $6.40 (that's per share right unless I am mistaken) so it would cost $640 for the option to purchase 100 Apple shares at $132 on 12th feb.

If the price on 12 Feb is $140 the profit per share on that contract is $140 - ($132 + $6.40) = $1.60 per share. Profit on the option contact is therefore $160?

Am I missing something?  


Also thanks for the help!

Totally agree. I recently reached $500k in Tesla gains by diamond handing it. Been in since March 2019 with original investment of $40k. I decided early on that my strategy was to simply hold until 2025 and not sell. Wouldn’t have anywhere near this level of gains if I took profits.

Remember back in September the correction started with Tesla not being included in S&P 500 and Etsy being included instead? I kinda feel the same way about the next correction. Again, the cue would be a massive rug pull in Tesla 🤮

I thought Q4 ER wasn't until March? 

I definitely agree about the conference since it will take a much more tech savvy CEO with credibility in that space to turn GME into what it needs to be to survive. 

I probably was a bit quick to get in since people think GME is a March to April play. I lost out on $$$ from everything popping this week because I'm stuck bag holding GME.  There's better money elsewhere right now honestly. 

Thanks for your take on everything. GME gang is full of bag holders that are trying to pump it to make their money back. We'll see what happens next week.

Never too late. These prices will look dirt cheap in 2023 just like TSLA shares look cheap from a couple years ago when compared to current price.
I don’t feel worse at all, you just sound naive when you claim, ‘all wealth does this’ in regards to borrowing against your in-realized assets. You don’t seem to understand how south that can go, and how quickly. If you’re operating successfully when leveraged, it’s luck.

You wouldn't believe how many people regret for leaving 5 million, 10 million, 15 million on the table. Several of my friends run into this situation. Last year when the stock was at $600 (pre-split), they thought selling $1500 Call was free money. Then the stock went to $4400 as of Friday. Last year the virus thing led to some unnecessary actions and regrets. Selling covered Calls is one of those things. It's an expensive lesson for myself too.

If I have to bet on 2023 Calls, I would be a buyer instead of a seller. At this time I just hold shares. Both call buyers and sellers have risks.

Have you guys heard of the new EV coming to the NYSE via SPAC. It’s called LION currently trading under NGA. Headquartered in Quebec, Canada 8 hours from where I live they’re making Electric School Busses and Trucks for goods. They recently signed a deal with Amazon. Might end up being the “LION” of the jungle.

Honestly I agree. Worked at a place selling phones and we were constantly out of stock. And like not just the base 12. You would be amazed the number of people buying iphone 12 pro max 256GB or pro 256GB. Then when we ran out of stock of some people would just buy whatever else we had. If they didn't get their favourite colour because it was out they bought a case. Factor in a lot of them were needing to buy chargers (even all the xr and 11s need chargers now too) and the fact air pods are just a huge thing now I think this will be a wild ER. Oh yeah and the m1 chip. People went nucking futs for those computers.
That give me hope. I tend to smoke hash (legally, canada yay, I get it in the mail lol) and trade whenever I get a day off.

I like NIO long term, but the hype vs what they presented doesnt match up. They dont own the battery they hyped up. CATL does. CATL also sells to every other company out there including tesla. The car is sexy as hell, but will be delivered without the new battery for the first year or two. Some of the metrics they used to take shots at tesla were from old specs as well. The battery swap station upgrades are nice as well, but irrelevant until an individual stations needs to do those 300 swaps possible a day. All fluff and little substance. Monday is going to be blood red.

But which ones
[deleted]
My first potential selling of an option,, may I ask a question?  If I own 100 shares, to do what you said, I just STO a call? I collect premium and only lose if the call expires ITM. Only difference from selling the shares direcltly would be the price change if it falls, right? I'd be stuck with the 100 shares at a lower price (which for tsla, I couldn't really care less). Thanks for pointers anyone :)
Remember when wsb thought weekend dow was a thing?
Might be so cool to see dad only 5 min a week...
Honestly, I really only like using technicals for buy signals. NIO if it hits higher than Friday's close on Monday will have confirmed a buy signal on a breakout pattern. A rise up to $70-75 is very reasonable.

That said, I expect it to gap up pretty good for Monday's open so fo what you will.

Position: Long shares
Well...no, we want it to go up now.

The way I see it, nio jumps monday. After that, depending on the % boost there will be a sell-off sometime next week and then another jump.  When the 2nd jump happens is a mystery.
I’m curious, how did you find out about Tesla when it was that small, and what compelled you to invest in it at that time?

I’m curious about your method cause maybe I can use it to identify other trades in the future

Ford reached a peak market cap of $80 billion back in 99, and that was just maintaining the status quo of traditional automaking, which realistically has been stagnant forever. Toyota is over $200 billion market cap, and they shook up the market back in their day but are the status quo now. Now there's a potential automobile revolution going on with companies in some grey area between a tech company and an automobile company.

When I say decades of growth, I don't mean growth decades from now. Huge growth potential within the next 2-3 years, with consistent strong growth for decades to come. Their valuation is high, but it's not unreasonable, and I don't expect their valuation to drop substantially unless if there's an economic crash.
Congratulations and fuck you

Price predictions for sell off?
I’m a long term TSLA shareholder and I consider NIO a potential threat.  That’s why I also bought a bunch of NIO a few months ago as well partly to hedge my Tesla risk.  NIO has a real potential to dominate the Chinese market, making Tesla merely the Apple version of cars.

Among all the EV makers so far.. NIO and tsla seem like the only ones who know what they’re doing and actually have pioneering technologies.  That may change in the future, especially with Apple entering the race (i also happen to own some Apple but for completely different reasons).

You could sell 21 CC’s on a doubling ($1600 strike, 2022) of the stock price for a quarter of a million and get that premium regardless and reduce your cost basis down to $-51.73. So you’ll be making money on the stock even if it somehow went down to $0. 

Then if it somehow hit that amount before 2022 and you were assigned, you’ll double your money from the current market value and keep the premium. So 4.03 million.

To help OP, nio has no cell to body. You think swapping is smart? Tesla discarded that idea 5+ years ago. Google gigapress + 4680 cell to body if you don't get it. I swear tsla bears are the dumbest 🤡 fuckers.
You don't need income if you have the cash to cover a mortgage.
Where my GigaCHADS at
you know what hit me today (don't mind me, i'm slow). I was thinking - since i am already 80% in on GMe of all my savings so far. Why not add another salary for LEAPS? here me out (and that's because i don't have a wife or her bf to talk to). JAN21 50C ? Crazy? i don't know. Probably, since i'm asking this question online (honestly so far been dealing only max 2month calls, so a full leap, i don't even know what makes sense for the strike price)
Imagine worshipping Jesus Christ and not Elon Musk. One can make you rich and develop technology making the world better. The other turns water into wine, I don't even fucking like wine

Why did GM rip off the Goodwill logo?
The way I figure it. If he really cares that we humans recognise him. Then there would be no vagueness or ambiguity to it, he wouldn't just whisper his existence into the ear of some dude hundreds or thousands of years before your birth. You would know with absolute certainty who/what god is and what (if any religion) was right. His presence would be known without question.

TLDR; God is way above our level to even think about. He's not some narcissist who needs constant praise.

It's not government policy driving this though. To make forums the new public square (regulating it as a utility), would require government regulation to make it so.
nio is far from where tesla is and tesla will win over the chinese market , I'd invest in tesla over nio at those current price. Nio won't even have the batteries ready before their new car is released...

“What is the meaning of life?” The genie asked, stroking his long blue beard. “It used to be to hunt, gather, reproduce, and multiply,” he pondered, “but now, what is valued most instead, seems to be to rapidly move your elbows on camera for 15-30 second videos.” 

Timmy, aged 7, recognized what the genie was trying to convey. “Tik tok!” Timmy spoke. 

“Yes, that,” The genie sighed, “is that really what you wish for?”

“Yes”

“Very well, kazam.”

Just then, Timmy’s hips expanded and his chest turned to miniature breasts. Timmy stood up and bursted into what some would describe as, dance. Timmy seemed to be singing, as he moved his elbows back and forth and shook his hips, but no sounds were coming out of his mouth. He didn’t stop. He couldn’t stop. And he was happy.

If you want to keep holding, consider cap gains harvesting now. You sell and immediately rebuy just to increase your cost basis, thus lowering cap gains in the future when you eventually want to sell.

at that price i would load up with my house on Tesla...
Just had to look FDs up LOL wsb’s makes me die haha.

As I said new to options sorry if I am being thick, with your 132c is your goal to profit from the contract premium change by selling the option after earnings?
For those of you who think big Chinese stocks like baba and nio are risky because they are chinese...you're missing out.  China isn't going anywhere, they have a huge growing population with money, they manufacture everything, and the CCP will do whatever it takes to make their winners win.  Yes, they cheat and violate human rights which is horrible, but as far as stocks go, don't sleep on them.
EU is a hard market to capture for sure. EU car makers should dominate majority here and I think any outsiders will have a hard time such as Tesla and NIO more so.

Biggest demand for EV : China , EU, then USA
But did you get your 4 free stocks? 🤮

Didn’t really watch but I do like NIO. Few things:

1) it’s still based on China and Trump is still in office. Past indicators have shown any whiff of Chinese news sells this off super hard. So short term id take gains and load up on dips. 

2) it’s branding itself as more than vehicles like Tesla does with energy. 

3) I’m not sure how Li is perceived in China but Musk is akin to Steve Jobs and is the richest man on earth. Unlike Steve Jobs literally everyone likes Musk and he lives in fuvking 2121. 

4) Their deliveries have been growing exponentially since last year. Be wary of some shit like a Hidenberg piece about their numbers. Not saying it’s another LK but again it’s current Chinese nature could bite you in the ass. 

Would I buy LEAPS? Probably not. But I would play 2-4 weeks out for the next few months starting February.

Don't know your tax situation but you probably should have sold a little before year end. You will also want to keep a very close eye on changes to the tax laws this year. There is talk of making cap gains rate equal to earned income rates and showing $2 million of normal income is going to be very expensive.

You may want to explore some of the more esoteric tax advantaged exchanges and diversification techniques for people with that much concentrated cap gains.

Tesla is already being outsold by GM in China EV market...
More big tech censorship
´cause it doesn’t break after 2 weeks.
My advanced analysis tells me that the market cap is only 90B right now for NIO. Considering the Chinese EV market is huge, even if they get to half of a TSLA at 400B, we looking at a conservative pricing of $240 a share. So, easy play is gonna be 300C for NIO this year
Just trying to educate myself, but can shares form one broker be transferred to another? Is there a cost? Also I see fidelity, schawb, TD, vanguard being mentioned. Is there a way to figure out and rank these from best to good in term of service, features ease of use? Or its just preference?
I'm pretty deep in them because I like the potential of their multiple revenue streams. 

Everyone seems fixated on the LV (bangbus), but they have food/delivery/utility trucks too, and they're getting paid by major car manufacturers to help with EV design which I'm guessing will eventually morph into a licensing play for their core tech.

Plus there's always the long-shot of a partnership with Uber or Lyft for their bangbus which is perfect for rideshare, or something like the Hyundai/Apple partnership news that came out last week - since their skateboard platform would allow Apple to spin out a car in less than a year, rather than 5-7 like everyone was projecting. 

Apple would just have to design the tophat (shell) - the user experience part they're good at, and not have to worry about the car guts getting in the way since those are all in the skateboard (wheelbase).
Anyone know why tho?
The DD we all needed 🙏🏼🙏🏼
i mean you're right to some extent, but you proved your stupidity by not realizing you have to look at it on a case-by-case basis.

sure on average, because doctors, hedge fund managers (this one especially), are smarter, and that helps them picking stocks to long and get mad gains.

but to say there aren't people with jobs like that losing tons of money? ridiculous. its really just extremely intelligent, PLANNing people.

you dont be successful, you plan for success. You want to be a millionare day trader? or retires in 5 years because you know you can pick a stock and beat the S&P? go for it!

but make sure you get a hospital job, stay single, and dedicate a large part of time to the hobby.

but i agree, you have to be smart, and some people are just naturally smarter than others. so honestly, a lot of people who try options or day trading are never going to get anywhere besides being in the right place at the right time, ie. luck.

To those speculating NIO will use CATL for 150kWh solid state battery and so other companies that partner with CATL will automatically get the tech (Tesla, VW, etc)...that's wrong.  It was leaked even before NIO day that NIO will not use CATL for the solid state technology.

I don’t think Tesla is partnered with anyone. Nio partnering with a company sort of adds to their legitimacy. It’s like having a workout partner vs doing it solo. When you get other parties involved on something it should add to your investment on the endeavor since you no longer can think as selfishly.

Yeah but BFT could hit $40 for all you know in 9 months and you would lose out on $20 per a share which would be $2000 assuming you only sell 1 covered call. Covered calls are bearish or neutral strategies. Don’t use them on a stock that will obviously moon because you will lose a lot of profits. You’re better off selling OTM short calls because you’ll actually keep your shares.

additional thing, I was just informed by a family member they came across someone who said "Tesla must be great because Elon just became richest in the world."  So there we go, we know there are these types of people who will, tomorrow go try to buy TSLA stock because of 1 headline but will then go -60% in a year and panic sell and wonder why the stonk pick didn't work out after Elon has cashed in on those billions of floating $'s.  

Elon himself could tank the company valuation if he sold his 30% stake and then rebought the same amount or even just 25% of the company shares just a few months later.  There's literally nothing preventing this from being a reality and therefore also a very real risk to buying TSLA.

I think it will eventually drop to some degree, but too many people pumping this company regardless means it might never really drop long term.

I wonder, even if this does go kablooey, if zoomers will pick THE stonk for them and ride it to space next?

\-20% every week for 4 weeks straight , back to $400
A man with a disconcerting taste.
In the US market 50-70% is used for transportation. I've seen that 20% global figure, but believe it's only for cars. It doesn't make sense otherwise, what is the other 80% used for?

Developing countries is where EV will have a rocket under it, as they need the cheapest available options - EVs are expensive but set to drop in price rapidly.
It’s been insane every day for every week for every month for nearly a year. I’m not saying that’ll continue but there’s NO reason why it’ll also just stop either.
Fuck dem tiddies
Bought leaps - will buy more if it dips Monday. BABA - go fight the thieves stealing our tendies!!

Listen to this man. Please acknowledge how much luck has gone your way to date, crystallise some of those gains.
I've never seen single person that poor (small cave and/or little pebble job) but making shit tons of berry in the rock market. That never happen actually.

See every single person hauling big wagon are Hunter, tribe chief, spear engineer in big village making 200k berry/year regularly.

Only extremely intelligent, successful people making berry in rock market. That's the reality.
If it got SpaceX to Mars faster he’d probably do it.

someone short it
Why doesn’t Parler go public so we can trade it?
I dont disagree, but Its going to take really bad news.  

At this point ride OTM calls and hedge appropriately
Nah dude, trust me, i swar its got another 10x in it, tesla will be worth $7.5T, thats not unrealistic at all
Probably the day StarLink IPOs
Set a stop loss and let it go!

True but no one has ever complained after getting gains like those... Even if it goes to $4k if he's not a retard he won't be angry with himself

Hope it dosen't gapdown thru the stop losses...
Like he said on a red day IV will drop but this was probably more than $100 otm when he bought. 99% of the time you just lit that on fire
Tight stops, don't lose your gains cause this is a long term dog.

In this situation you’re a retard not an autist. However yes there are tendies to be had. There’s risk but that’s how Casinos work
Max loss write off is like 3k, right?  Just carry over the whole loss into 2021 taxes.  You may need to file an amended return if you want your refund now though.

Your username suggests you're 1 year older than me, and I'm 28.

What hole in your life is there that $1.8 million would not fill? You invested $150k, and held on for a while, so I'm guessing you're not exactly poor...You probably have a steady job with decent income, or inherited some money that you were comfortable enough to YOLO a while ago. 

$1.8 million, even if you just kept pace at inflation in a conservative investing account, is enough for $45k/year (equivalent) for forty years. You'd be almost 70, and have a lifetime of earning and investing elsewhere to become rich beyond your wildest dreams... But that $1.8 million would guarantee you and your family would never starve.

You could take risks, start a business, move to a foreign country without much of a plan, or even play video games and travel for the rest of your life and relax. You could pay for generations to go to college, or to have family visit you every Christmas. You could be the kindly uncle or neighbor who pays for the braces of a kid down the street. That money can make your life, and the lives of those around you better, but only if you're willing to spend it.

You're already a millionaire. Will the chance of maybe becoming a billionaire fill the hole in your heart? You won't become the world's first trillionaire by holding a small amount of one stock. Money is not its own good, and the nihilistic collection of it independent of its ability to do good is the same vampiric mindset that justifies gambling away a great gift for the possibility of *maybe* someday having more. Ask yourself what good $1.8 million can do, and what harm would come if you lost it.
Capitalism is the most fun game anyone has ever invented.

If it’s any consolation, ARKG bought 850,000 shares on 1/8. Cathie Wood is buying the dip.
ok
10,000% gain implies a 7.5T market cap, Elon musk says its overvalued, and every autist just got their $600 stim check and thought to put it in Tesla. Sell 10% of you holdings, recoup principal, and then watch the rest melt away to nothing so at least you wont lose money

I kind of hate you
Just couple thoughts on these 

3) This is what I mean by my 2nd point. Competiton stepping up and people buying 

4) Fair point . However TSLA is included in S&P500 now. Everyone "buys" it with 401Ks etc etc

5) I do believe there will be some notable dips like 100 points or even more but I believe dips will be bought very aggressively. Hence it won't truly burst until 1) or 2)
TSLA to the moon!!! 🚀🚀🚀

Why do you think we ended green in froday
They’re called FDs for a reason.

Secondly even if you’re OTM, if the underlying increases the derivative can 10x anyways. Say I buy a 145c for $0.15 each 3DTE, if AAPL gaps up $3, that contract still has 0 intrinsic value (OTM) but could be priced at 1.5 instead. If you don’t hold to expiration all those tenders are yours

Scared money don’t make money
There’s a point when you question if the market is actually reflecting reality - whether that’s now or what it’s gonna be worth in 2030. Selling a bit at that gain wouldn’t hurt at all. You could buy a nice place in the Caribbean if you sell a few hundred shares

I think it’s more about the mentality. The less you care about money the more likely you’ll make money. Works because you won’t paper hand when things go south. Poor people get mad tight when they lose $10. Whereas for rich people, they invest to make money work for them.

Any platform marketing itself as an alternative to a popular social media app/site but with a focus on free speech and no moderation inevitably attracts nazis, as that's the only place where they're not immediately banned or laughed out the door.

You have to have money to make money, if a person cannot pay their bills for basic needs why would they invest. What we should do is start a fund based on our gains, donate 2% of our gains to address wealth inequality

NIO day was meh. Tesla 1000c 1/29
it's fine. it's a nice product but still luxury segment (7-series/model S competitor) so it really doesn't expand the NIO product line which is all luxury, aside from the fact that it's a sedan.

didn't announce anything surprising besides MAYBE the NVDA thing which is probably more bullish for NVDA than anything (they already have a similar deal with LI)

considering the price action on friday it's safe to assume it's been priced in

People have constantly said, Tesla has been overinflated since at $60 . It’s going to keep going up.
You'll owe interest from the time it was earned, plus the penalty, figure like 5-6%.  Enough to make hiring someone to figure it out worthwhile, plus they can help you avoid this in the future.

They also may find a way to avoid it, I'm not an expert, but given the unusual circumstances you may be eligible for a waiver.

Yes I understand the accidents are tragic. But Fukushima and the other accidents are usually due to poor management and equipment. Fission reactors have also evolved to be more safe as well. If you are just looking at the cold truth, nuclear reactors beats all other energy sources in almost every way right now. Only problem with them would be the chance for an accident and the production of nuclear waste(which is safely contained so it’s not a big problem). 

I think the real solution would be finding and implementing fusion reactors. I don’t get why we’re trying to invest so much in solar panels and wind turbines when they clearly aren’t the long term solutions.

I’m in no position to really criticize, but politicians, media, and even some scientists take  stupidity and misinformation to another level.

Honestly I’m feeling really shitty right now, I just started the process of opening my td Ameritrade account a week ago on Friday. It still isn’t open yet. Anyway I wanted to buy 740c 1/8 calls for $7.50, but I couldn’t since my account wasn’t opened yet. Would have turned $750 into $14k. So yeah I’m feeling shitty.

Oh well. There’s always next week. Nothing I can do now.
i’m hoping on monday there’s a panic sale because of this parler app thing (or whatever that is). i’ve never even heard of or quite know what the drama is. but i want in.  my 200 shares aren’t close to enough.
Yeah bc EV has such a problem raising capital

Hey I’m new to options so bear with me I am retarded, I also think AAPL is going to kill earnings. I looked at some call options and the premium for 132c is almost $6, why would I buy these options instead of just shares doesn’t that mean to make money I’d need the price to be above 138 dollars (plus transaction fees) for these to be profitable?
So it is secure? Lol

Buy the dip
I saw you post something similar when somebody said weary when they meant wary... Do you just go around condemning random people on reddit for their spelling mistakes? You need to find some better things to do with your life man
fuck, i wanna buy some april spy 400c's but when the fuck do i enter with all this green
I'll update everyone that replies when I get around to it. It's not gonna be hard, just gotta ease into things cause I see this guy every 2-4y and there's a 35y age gap

Should I buy 4 tsla 1200c 1/22 Monday at open?
He Lost. It's 💎 Time!
My schooling, my money, my family, everything
Thanks. With a covered call, you get the premium up front when you sell the option and don't have to give to it back. So I would keep the 4.75 premium for the option (it's already in my account), then be obligated to sell the shares that I bought for a little under $15 for $20 and pocket the $5 difference as well.
I got those 1100 1/15's too. No fear.
I bought mine at $9 and sold at $6.12 in 2018 😭

Here’s the deal. I lost like $4k on the stock market last year. But because my income was only $23-4k, and I’m in college(tax credits) I don’t owe any income tax. Should I even wait until the middle of February when Robinhood and TD  gives out the 1099’s to claim that shit? It literally won’t change the amount of taxes I owe/refund. I like to file my taxes on the first day. I would hate to have to wait another 3-4 weeks for my money. I don’t feel like $4000 is enough for them to really care, but what do you think?
I’ll message you everyday for a year saying that you are  the mother fucking wolf of wallstreetbets for a $1000 upfront.

Make a free account on thinkorswim and you can paper trade options. You can go crazy on the fake $100k you start with and learn as you try different things.
Yeah, hydrogen is abundant but not commercialized at the scale necessary for mass transportation at this time.

Personally I am not a huge fan of hydrogen but it's one of the only ways to build an all-electric airliner in the next decade.
Good looks, and I’d love thoughts on NIO if you feel so obliged ❤️❤️
Wtf xD
Yeah really looking forward to the end of lock up. Should be in a week or six.
For my guys who are deep into NIO and Tesla what are we going to do on Monday when it crashes
Same. We’ll have to start insulting ppl like ppl do in gtao. Like:

Fxck you you piece of shxt bxtch @ss rxtard
As retarded as op is, the ones saying “we’ll be back where we were last week” are doubly super retarded because a 20% drop from ~ 880 is much larger than a 20% rise from 720. 

Plus everybody here is buying weeklies with their ramen noodle money, so a drop that big would wipe out a lot of wsb
I was honestly too scared to even list my 600 shares for 80 strike for covered calls 1/15 but maybe you will be alright
I see we're doing leveraged ETFs again on WSB lmao
I wanna do my first Tesla call next week but scared once I buy it will finally have a small correction
The moon is 10000 miles away so no. I’ll stick with tsla thanks. 🖕🏻🤓👍🏼
APPL got 2 price upgrades before earnings. Are you holding through after earning?

XPEV and Li won't compare to NIO. Long-term NIO is a clear winner.

Ok think I’m f’ed 😩. How much is the penalty?
You should of when it hit $39. Why do I keep seeing posts like this every time, why can't you guys just buy and hold? Why is that so hard. Watch it go to $100 in 2 months and another guy comes in and asks,  "Did I miss out guys"
So buy put leaps
Elon is smart enough to never go near a girl with eyes like that
There's more than enough growth for both companies. If only 5% of china's population is able to afford a Nio or Tesla, that's a market of 70 million people. With the fastest growing middle class in the world, there's going to be alot of EV sale ls potential in the coming decades.
Maybe I shouldn’t have sold my Nio shares 😐

Nio day wasnt for the market, it was for CONSUMERS AND FANS why do you think they didnt announce europe expansion? Which would have been announced today if Nio day was really for investors

They could do many things. You are praising twitter for being dumb but not going full retard. This is like calling someone prudent for jumping from 5 stories instead of 10.  

Notice how no one is advocating shorting Facebook for similar approaches. Because mango accounts for 0.0001% of their business. Twitter is uniquely reliant on mango for traffic from both sides. The mango haters as well as the base. Regardless of politics and the legality of things, this was very dumb from Twitter. Which is why I believe they are doing this for ideological reasons despite it potentially irreparably damaging their business.

I'm doing as much reading as I can to make more sense of this. But I surmise just based on emotions alone, the stock will be on a downward spiral to the low 30s starting Monday market open. Under different circumstances I might just sideline, but I already think the market is close to a large correction anyways.

I'm glad there are many on WSB on the other side of this. If we are in unanimous agreement then the trade is already done.

Canoo uses nvidia for their self-driving platform too, this isn't unique or special to Nio lol.
Depends your patience and risk level.

Low risk / medium - long wait: 
ICLN calls for July or January 2022
 • Democrats control the house, senate, and presidency. $2 trillion+ green energy bill can come out very soon.
 • No brained easy money and a massive position in my portfolio

High risk / short wait: 
Option 1. MSFT $222.5 Jan 15 calls
 • Very weird bullish flow targeting for next week that’s been happening
 • Blue chips typically do really well when there is a lot of uncertainty. At the moment, we shot up very high and very fast. We could see a quick rotation back into blue chips
 • There’s been a lot of consolidation and MSFT could explode up any moment
 • Very tiny position for my account and almost a gamble

Option 2. Tesla $1000 calls for Jan 22
 • I mean why the fuck not
 • I’m holding 1 of these for fun. NIO is also a good option
No mortgage at first. Buy the house on margin then refinance if I decide
$69.420
Always fresh bro
That's not very cash money of them :(
Toyota is overvalued?

The first amendment is there to protect you from government. That's why private companies can make thier own rules. I'm just saying that there needs to be a change. This shit is anti american and anti freedom.
I left a130k on the table with tesla shares, so I am biased in thinking that it's overvalued, but I have yet to find a coherent justification for even half of it's current valuation.

Europe and China use different standards for determining range compared to the US. I think China is using NEDC (I forget) while the US is EPA. Our EPA ranges are generally closer, but even those range numbers are near impossible to achieve.
Are any of you holding Jan 15? I have a 210/230 call spread play going. 

Then feb 195c and Jan 2023 270c

im basing traping $20 to $30 price range.

I have 1500 shares right now , sold 2 CC at $24, sold 2 CSP $24 , Sold 5 CC $27 and 5 $30 CC, sold 1 $26. I also have CSP puts exp in 1/15, 1/22 and 1/29.

my plan is to keep selling call and put in 20 to 30 range while keeping 200 shares until $50 minimum, any extra profit use to buy more shares for free,
I’m thinking mid 70s but I’ll take 80!

By the rule of 72, it seems like you’re looking for something that would provide around a 14.4% annual return. I don’t know off the top of my head but maybe this helps others on thread give advice.
Think about it guys. Our kids are gonna thank us one day for investing in $NIO. This is a 30 year play.

You would need your withholding this tax year (2020) to be at least the amount of total tax paid in tax year 2019 to avoid the penalty.
Yeah but does that include Herzegovina?
I was too scared to sell that call cuz I think it will print honestly. Good luck to you bud
Easy, scrape the ticker data from the stats panel and set up trades according daily to maintain equal weight.
This is one way, another would be to recharacterize the Roth into a traditional IRA. If you made the contribution in ‘21, then you don’t have to worry about that until tax time of ‘22, so it’s not necessarily the most pressing issue rn

Don't know anything about it but maybe it is. Learning through doing helps reinforce concepts so once you start trading, mental gains should accelerate.

Too many numbers. From someone that's actually studying green energy and just ecology in general, tesla will beat anyone for the next 5 years atleast. Atleast until solid state batteries come out, which by then will be just competition, not the revolution.
ICLN only
Shut up retard.
Nobody who's serious about GME ever said that we expectint anything before the ICR on Monday. And if that doesn't do anything, it's waiting for RC his move. So no need to make up shit like u do
Super smart to never sell
You better show up, i shaved my beaver for you
No, it's not. Just because a system is turned on doesn't mean it has any particular level. Just because a company makes a statement, doesn't mean it is true. 

It's not even legal to turn it on in some countries.

All I have seen is that Teslas can drive well on easy roads and were struggling a year ago in more complicated areas. I have not seen people drive again in those areas, announcing that it now is great. I have seen people say with the latest software version that it was still dangerous. 

The level of safety they should be aiming for is *complete* silence from tens of thousands of Tesla YouTubers and that's just not going to happen, because of design flaws.

If I would be the German legislator, I'd never allow this piece of shit to go on the roads with FSD in the firmware of the car.
*WE TOLD YOU SO!*

TSLA bears in July when TSLA has a -10% week because Elon openly disclosed he has a cold and posted about Gone in 60 Seconds being his guilty pleasure movie.

thanks i need to look into this. i do have a real job but i didn't get 'they withheld at least as much as he paid in taxes last year'? Is last year 2019 or 2020?
What's the point then?
I gained 15 lbs during this pandemic
Pretty much all of that was already known before nio day. I don’t think anything big will happen to Tesla. Big momentum going for tesla
There’s a bunch of different ways to get a 4% return in the market. S&P on average returns 6% annually so if u do that you only take out the 4-6% every year and always keep your principal. There’s also specific dividend yield etfs with only S&P companies. If you like real estate you could invest into REITs (the good ones always pay good dividends and they’re relatively safe if you believe in the real estate market). Your best friend here is google. Just search up “safe high dividend yield etfs/stocks” and preferably pick what you know/understand don’t just invest in a company because their yield is really high
Trump is this u?
20% would put us back 1 week. Lmao such a downfall

Robinhood is a huge company now, they're going to go public pretty soon and their valuation is likely to be over 20 billion, possibly over 40. They don't have the same level of sophisticated features that other brokerages have because their market is different, but I don't think them folding and losing people's money is at all likely at this point.
1/2 to 5/8 isn't a big difference. Smaller the pipe the higher the gas pressure just need to check if it matters for a dryer. Never had a dryer that wasn't electric

The link may be, however what op said was not. He classified “trump supporters” as domestic terrorist.. And by the looks of some of the pictures from capitol there are many well known Antifa and BLM members as well as some far right wingers there.
The media is funny. CNBC could not believe the market didn’t crash with the Capitol insurrection. It’s almost as if all those investors were licking their chops eager to buy the dip. When it didn’t happen, they were left staring at empty hands.

Even today the news outlets seem to want to drag down America. Things are hopeful (vaccines, new administration), but they want to keep dwelling in the past.

Can we stay positive and keep the money flowing in?

I’d focus more on getting quality material over a brand name if you’re on a budget. 

Ever watch a movie and they comment on a cheap suit? It’s the material. 

Lookup like super 180 and read about materials. 

Some of the designers use cheap ass materials and charge $1000+ for it cuz of the label. Nothing against brands, but I’d rather have a nice brand less suit that looks sick over a name brand that looks cheap. 

If you can afford name brands and the nice material. Just go to Neiman Marcus, Bergforf Goodman or Saks 5th. They’ll have it all.

Seriously, considering it 1) would encroach going against their CoNStiTutiOnal rigHTs belief and 2) they are overwhelming benefiting from continued aggressive rhetoric (data shows the far right overwhelming has more echo chamber postings/pages).
Ask the staff when sales are coming up, they’ll usually tell you. The cheapest I think I’ve seen for the 1818 (what you should get) is like $695 for 2 piece. But I think the average sale ends up being like 1k~

But you do get that this is about violent extremists?
That's a fair point, I guess we'll see come earnings. Twitter in my opinion was never the social media stock to own. SNAP and FB were the only two I ever want to be involved with and alot of other investors feel the same. So I think if something does happen it'll be subject to more selling pressure. That all remains to be seen tho, I just see the point this guy is making and think he could be on to something. But thanks for your counter and  best of luck out there!

First, there are not as many Trump loyalists as you think. Majority of people don’t give a shit about politics (half of people don’t vote). Second, Twtr users are all over the world, not just in the US. Yes some may leave TWTR but it won’t make a dent in their fundamentals.

Goes without saying but go talk to an excellent tax accountant. Not the walk in places. Well done!
Probably not, it can be avoided this year if he has a real job and they withheld at least as much as he paid in taxes last year.  Next year will be a different story though, start paying now.

" The IRS says you need to pay estimated quarterly taxes if you expect:

You’ll owe at least $1,000 in federal income taxes this year, even after accounting for your withholding and refundable credits (such as the earned income tax credit), and
Your withholding and refundable credits will cover less than 90% of your tax liability for this year or 100% of your liability last year, whichever is smaller. (The threshold is 110% if your adjusted gross income last year was more than $150,000 for married couples filing jointly or $75,000 for singles.)"

Don’t be a degenerate get some coochie
Right but we could look at the book value of Tesla which is $16.91/share. How does that compare to the current share price? Assuming there was some fraud, the share price could collapse effectively to $0. By thst I mean the bottom is effectively a 99% loss if they needed to shut the doors...

They don’t have to and they have a concrete product, plus batteries, plus the charging infrastructure but their Price to Book value is absurd. 

So it’s not that far off. The P/B multiple is based on “faith they will revolutionize energy, the auto industry...etc”

Because to a Tesla fanboy, Tesla is better than everything, so it ***should*** be a higher enterprise value than the entire auto industry... therefore, room to grow!

Excellent DD but I’d be a bit worried since many retail locations are and remain closed. Of course people can buy from the website, but the whole deal with testing/touching a product before purchasing makes me concerned about new purchase. Replacement purchase being strong by comparison. Not sure what portion of overall sales comes from in store “impulse purchases” also, but that too must be way down.

That being said I am currently long $AAPL.

I see your point. But I think enough die hard trump loyalists will leave twitter to effect daily active user counts  by at least a couple percent. I also think that will have a material impact on the stock in the coming earnings report. Social media companies are already in a rough spot, a small miss in daily active users could have big consequences for the stock price. This isn't fb, it's twitter, and everyone know twitter isn't the best ran buisness.

My thoughts also.  Definitely gonna inverse all the magatards that say they're gonna quit their accounts that only used to follow the orange menace anyway.  Buyden + stimmy + loan forgiveness etc etc hype shit will be trending on social media for the next full year.

Michael Burry’s the type of guy to short TSLA..... oh wait!
Wife’s boyfriend is in a similar situation but an order of magnitude less. Although I’ve been a firm believer in Tsla and Elon, the only thing driving stocks right now is not based on reality. The valuation and P/E of tsla just doesn’t make sense. How much cash was aapl generating when it reached a trillion. Well, tsla ain’t nowhere there, and fundamentally they’re very similar things: tech companies, but tsla has worse margins. At the same time, it’s hard to know when the retards will stop pumping tsla. IMO we’re in a huge bubble. Gonna try and lock some gains, cause until then it’s just porn.
How's that different from me now?

Idk, I think we’ve got 4-6 months to soak this up some more, but after the next massive covid stimulus gets approved and things start opening up, I wouldn’t be surprised to see stuff start pulling back.

Trump left the incoming with a disastrous grenade ready to explode when looking at an inflated stock market and floundering economy.

They’ll need to pass immediate infrastructure and green jobs packages quickly to stem the coming housing and unemployment debacle.
When is Apple going to MOOOON
We don't feel sorry for 🏳️‍🌈🐻s here
He has 100 contracts on PLTR. 100 contracts on TSLA that have any chance of doing anything, even “cheap” weeklies, would be far higher than $7k in total cost (or $9.3k I guess with the current unrealized loss on his current shares. The cheapest ones are 1/15 $1260 calls at $1.77, so 100 of those would cost $17,700 and have a roughly 3% chance of being in the money by close next Friday. The stock would have to be gaining like 10% every day to outrun theta at that strike, maybe slightly less, but still the odds are absurd. It would be like a 69% gain from close Friday to $1260 by Next Friday. Lol 69%. Nice. Watch it happen now goddamnit.
Wsb had me banned until recent. I did 66%. How’d you do?
Not as much retention I would’ve wanted on this.
Yeah, 1160 1/22, first time ever, really hoping this pays off lol
Hope you’re all having an amazing weekend!
I may be autistic but that's a retarded take.

🚀🚀🚀
Can’t bring myself to buy 100 shares of Tesla at 800/share
I think this is the last week imma be a permabull until we get another pullback
Instead of risking potential bankruptcy from any individual oil company, I suggest buying and oil ETF like GUSH. Not only are you protected from bankruptcy, but this ETF is also leveraged, meaning multiplied gains if oil comes back.
wait bro let me apply my logic fundamentals and some macro-economical models bro compare it to other bubbels in the past man same scenario  total crash incoming man totally overvalued 🤡🤡🤡
Hypothetically, what if Trump decided to come onto this sub and tell us to send Twitter to oblivion? I'm curious to see the general consensus.
Sell CCs at a strike you'd like to sell at. If your shares get called away you reached your goal even if you left some money on the table.
Yup! Most people love drama. Free speech is the hottest drama right now. TWTR is more active than ever

what do you think has been happening for the last year retard
⚠ TENDIES ALERT ⚠  
$GOEV will present at CES 2021 alongside many other new EV brands this week!  
They will introduce their new consumer-model which might be groundbreaking (it's fairly new, cant say if it will catch on but they want to rent the cars without a contract with a single monthly fee that includes everything from charging to insurance).  
 
Additionally, $GOEV is rumored to be the skateboard used for the Apple Car (via Hyundai's & Canoo's partnership).
nvda calls goev shares baba leaps
This is the way
In a few months youll still be a wagecuck at your 9-5 and still chasing chinese scams
Traditional Republicans, yes. The Trumpian America First "We're not the world's police" government of the past four years? Not so much.

Say what you like about Trump, but he was clearly anti-war with his focus on negotiating for peace in the Middle East and Korean Peninsula.
And the platform is so so so slow. Every day when market opens, it’s impossible to load options price. Im not sure why they try to make it overly complicated to the point it’s not use friendly anymore. They should make a “light” version replicating RH interface.
Except for Disney, which falls in the 00.01%.
They found it chill
You assume that most people follow Trump. Not true. Most people follow drama. Free speech is the hottest drama right now and TWTR is more active than ever.
What if it went down though?
Wonder if the fed will shut down the markets until the transfer of power?
same bro, etfs are not worth unless you have a huge portfolio. my new plan is make yolo calls until i have 10k and then do etfs again
Psth
Yea ICLN made me like 15k last week so I might try that again
Elon is the new Steve Jobs, he will innovate and make money in whatever he does.
Hot
You didn't actually make any money until you actually sell your stock though.
You can go to some place that sells suits like Macy’s and try some on to find your size and then order one online once you know your sizing. 

Then just take the pants to a dry cleaner to be hemmed. Like $10. 

To get the entire suit tailored will run $50-few hundred depending on where you go. Not always necessary. But it looks way better. For interviews go with blue or greys and relaxed tie colors. Black suits and reds or bright colors in ties give off a since of dominance to some interviewers that could work against you.
everything's just melting up
That’s what I told myself selling TSLA $400s pre-split. That was high back then.
Their biggest hype was the battery...

Which they aren’t the manufacturer of and which everyone including Tesla will be trying to get their hand in the cookie jar for.
You’re right it literally can’t go down.

Autonation - would fit with the infrastructure plan.
Thats what people don’t understand. Enron was cooking the books and straight up lying about contract values and did some shady and corrupt shit with Californias energy spending as well. Tesla most likely isn’t doing anything illegal. Overpriced could be yes but being overpriced wasn’t what brought Enron to Zero. And it won’t with Tesla either
You can bet it’s gonna gap high before coming back down a bit, so maybe buy around 11am
Until we've cleared lockup, it's gonna be bumpy.  I've been meaning to sell cc's on it, but just can't pull the trigger.

Fair enough, if your break even is that low it's a good trade.

Technically, costs were 1M, for returns of 2M, but that's misleading as I used profits to fuel future winning trades. My initial stake was 100K, which I turned into 1M, so that's 1000% gain.

No they don't. Ark's 22k PT pre split presumes TSLA keeps their market share of EVs as it is today. As if today Ford and GM still can't even make an EV profitably.

Look at Apple, they sell a minority of cell phones yet owns the majority of the profits.

>"Ceramic bearings have major advantage over traditional steel bearings in  EVs because the electric current can flow over steel bearings and cause  micro welds/ premature failure."

So are current vehicle manufacturers oblivious to their wiring, allowing electrical current to make its way through bearings and other parts regularly....? 

&#x200B;

>"Bearings will be the high performance high precision components driving performance advantages in the industry."

Yeah, definitely not battery/energy storage, or raw material cost, or any other thing related to overall production. Tiny little bearings are surely the game changer here.

What is your point of this post anyway? You think the company is going to take off because you had to order an expensive, application-specific bearing for a milling machine? Or that their new bearing tech is THE answer for next-gen upgrades and cost reductions?

Also, ban.

Dude for your fucking safety do not be in here if you don't know the answer to that. But, exercising an option is only profitable if you WANT to own the stop. You lose the extrinsic value you paid when you exercise, it's why the break even price isn't the same as the strike price.
Using the internet as some kind of an electric.... vehicle for their platform.... a sustainable source of... big dick energy

Me, about TSLA in the last year, every time it pumps:

"Damn, this thing is pumping, but probably too late to get in on."

"Oh shit, should've bought.  Now it's too late for sure."

"Fuck.  Ok, NOW surely it's too late."

"GODDAMMIT.  How can it keep going up?  I'm not gonna be stupid and buy at the top though."

"Fuck! That wasn't the top... But surely THIS is."

"Oh fuck off"

"Really?"

"Sigh"

"End me."

............................................

But really though, now is probably actually the top... right?
no it isn't I have the money, I just kept it instead of buying the car in full
It's hyped because it's shorted to hell and in order to cover, will cause mass price squeeze.

Look up Porche and the Volkswagen squeeze.

Martin Shkreli KBIO squeeze.
I'd say $1k is a significant psychological barrier and I'd sell just below that. Maybe you should hedge a potential big drop with a Stop order. Let it continue to go up, but walk that Stop limit up as it increases.
you have to stay in the game somehow
Tiktok and instagram stock traders are the same thing, its like trading gurus on youtube. They all make money but the followers don't exactly post gains in the youtube comments as much.

WSB usually likes to go all-in on tops (aside from TSLA which only goes up)
WSB going full bulltard as usual.
The euphoria just started because of the endless pumping on social media, and from guys like Chamath & Jim Cramer. Any dips will be bought quickly.

No don’t listen to WSB hold some dividend stocks for DRIP.. it’s anti WSB but it is the way to go for a long term portfolio I promise. Try to keep a percentage of the portfolio in these Dividend Aristocrat stocks
Suits?! I'm in basketball shorts and a hoodie
250 for a large/xl suit and then get it tailored for something quick. if you want one for long term use, get a 95%+ wool blend (important imo) and get it tailored. i spent about 50\~100 for tailoring at a local spot.

You know how gambling works, right? Eventually you rake in your chips. There’s nothing wrong with taking half off the table, selling covered calls on 25% and holding the other 25% if you’re a degenerate.

NIO has never pumped TSLA. Doesn't work that way. Everything follows TSLA not the other way around.
Normal stonks it’s safe to sell weeklies outside of its 1 week expected move with a decent success rate. This week TSLA move 3x its expected move which is very rare. That’s why shorts die on this thing
I like this, but you could get shafted by after hours or pre market. Your rich enough now to be with a broker though that operates in them

Such an Apple move to put a fancy picture at the top.

I bought calls on Thursday looking at the dip and earnings coming up.

Nope other than my art and stocks I don’t have anything nice
Depends on what OP earned during last year. I'm still a working student and don't make enough to pass the standard deductions. But OP should definitely set aside \~40% of that amount to prepare between now and filing time. I do not know what state you live in, but do not let this become a burden from the IRS.

Ive been selling so many covered calls and puts for the past 2 months that my average cost for 350 shares of PLTR is = -7k , its like getting paid 7k to own 250 shares of PLTR, the question is should I sell or should I hold to $40 or $50 ? will it ever go to $100? if yes then why
Happy Cake Day retard, may your candle sticks be green and your portfolio fund your wildest dream.

What % gain is that?
Boo hoo.

Yes they could have. Twitter has been criticized for not applying their own Terms of service to trump due to how popular he was. At the end of the day they’re a private business that can deny service. The recent move was a calculated decision given he’s on his way out

How much do you degenerates spend on suits?
The first ones probably won't be battery powered but hydrogen.
Though this does depend a lot on how battery density changes in the next couple of years.

An airliner takes a stupidly long time to go from design to maiden flight and during that time the tech choices are effectively locked even though improvements are happening. (see here Boeing Dreamliner battery fiasco with pack design that was just outdated)

So if there is going to be a design started soon my bet would be on hydrogen + electric motors.

If no design starts soon then once battery tech is available, which is probably 5-10 years away, design can then start and we could see airplanes another 5-10 years after that.

Exxon is interesting, as it used to have cheap call options back in September, due to the market pricing in a dividend cut. This fire-sale might have disappeared by now, as things are looking better. 

I'd need to check historical options data on it, which I won't/can't due to having to pay a bunch of cash for this privilege. 

Exxon has a ton of problems right now, and that's why its still pretty low, but it does have a few bright spots. Even though some people list Exxon focusing only on oil as a downside, I see it as a huge upside over its competitors. This current Green/EV bubble is gonna pop in the next few years, and all the companies either wasting money or time trying to attract this capital are going to suffer. Meanwhile, Exxon continues to spend heavily on proven cheap reserves, such as Guyanna, which is one of the best oil field finds in the last decade or so.

Eventually, money has to talk. Exxon generates money like very few non-tech companies, and they only spend money in order to make more of it. Green energy is not lucrative yet, and my opinion is the doubling down on oil for the 2020s is the right move. Maybe by 2030s it wont be, but I dont think we are as far along as the world wants to pretend right now.

Exxon if you like a bit of risk, Chevron for a more secure but less lucrative option.
Blue wave son who's gonna stop it now, maybe Kamala? But then she'd kill her political career immediately.

If you haven't looked at the data or testing methodology for yourself it is no different than putting your faith in a religion. If your going to believe "science" especially politically motivated science you are no better than the religious people you shit all over. 

I need to end this conversation for now, but if you'd like to blindly tell me about more science that youbhavent researched or dont understand later maybe we can do that. Btw pcr tests are invalid after 20 cycles or so and they run the covid ones 30 or more thats why the gigantic amount of false positives and inflated numbers of non symptomatic positives. You can look that one up but I'm sure all the scientists would gladly tell you how the pcr covid test is flaud and the stats are a lie. Right. Fauci would say that I'm sure.

Nice job! What are you gonna spend the 30k (don't forget about uncle Sam) on?
Depends, are you in the green or the red?
What are you on?! You realize Republicans spend way more on defense?!
You’re trying to swim upstream here. Even if you’re logical, the market is not. It’s ways easier to make $ on an upward momentum than a downward trend.
Pump n dump, in n out, then get out of there bro.

Only way to catch TSLA is if Tesla stops everything now and wait
She got no ass
Atleast self half bro. You have it made. You’re a millionaire
That’s how positive I am. And not just for reasons listed in OP. I actually don’t think these companies will exist in the same capacity they are in just under two weeks.
Do you get the ass or the mouth?

Yes, absolutely you are right. Oil majors are moving into green energy. Google says
"Shell’s restructuring drive mirrors moves in recent months by European rivals BP and Eni which both plan to reduce their focus on oil and gas in the coming decade and build new low-carbon businesses."
However, I don't believe that these Oil companies are transitioning to Green energy fast enough. They're going to get caught"flat-footed" like some of the car manufacturers.
I got off Twtr a few weeks ago and after ten years on FB deleted that account after downloading all my pictures.

Alright boys let’s pump NIO all week
They won’t release Q4 sales just holiday sales. It’s a 9 week period that ends the first week of January. This is the one from 2020 https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2020/01/13/1969887/0/en/GameStop-Reports-2019-Holiday-Sales-Results.html

Tesla caring your whole portfolio, like everybody else on this sub Reddit
APHA’s fine too, depending on how far out you’re going. It’s gonna be rolled into TLRY soon so I’d say either short term options or just shares.
I really hope OP does listens to this

This is what my dad was doing. Ran the wheel on TSLA successfully for all of a month before it went off the rails. His last shares got called away at 660 on S&P day and I told him it was prob for the best because it was likely done going up for a while 🤡
Imagine if you bought calls..

Actually maybe there was a Bubble before. At Castilia (part of actual Spain) you could buy the right to work for the state. The salary was seen as a stable income opposed to the 99% of other incomes at that time (war, farming, commerce) some nobles started to be more and more interested in buying them and finally they were seen more as a status symbol. Finally the priced skyrocket so you needed houndreds or thousands of years of the salary to recover the investment. Equivalent of what happens now to TSLA ratios.
Nice one mate, I hope I can do the same in the next years 💪🏻
It’s not the same model. Same class, different model. This one is like 25 years old, and they’re still investigating if it’s the planes fault

Fanduel has crashed like 3 weeks straight, I agree, it's actually my favorite, and they will probably give more bonus this week because of this, but promotions are everywhere, you'll get free money anywhere, but if you can't use your money what's the point? Draftkings is one of it directive competitors, at least in similarity to it.

Looking at PLTR's one month chart makes me kinda sad

lol dude, even options spreads were so hard to gain tendies on short legs last week, and you are telling about naked PUTs? lol, not with TSLA
what put would you buy? 850?
I agree. This is a slippery slope and I hope we all don’t eventually regret this.

Long term implications are probably not good. They are taking the responsibility of the content on their site which I think will end up dropping their liability shield eventually.
How many hours a week they make her work though?   
like if I worked 60 hours a week I would also make 5k a week because of the overtime
asking yourself when  does TSLA crash is like asking when PLTR makes gains lmao
Stop being so dramatic. All they did was finally hold Trump to the same terms of service everybody else has to follow. They've let him get away with breaking the rules for so long and are finally enforcing them.
Most insane number you can think of,  longest time to expiry.

I’m not saying to ask your accountant for stock advice.
It wasn’t a 737. 

But it will be their stock.
Ah well i have a fuck ton of 1/15 20c. Like 88 contracts deep. Hoping it runs to 17-18 monday
Weird way to say you suck dick behind the Wendy's dumpster.
TWTR is forcing an exodus of at least 50 million people away from Twitter (guessing, it might be more). This from a company who can’t turn a profit. This from a company who was interfering in the election, preventing Hunter Biden news, putting warnings on Trump tweets, but not Joe’s, not on Chinese officials. 

Do you not see the writing on the wall? Trump is going to use EO13848 to seize TWTR, FB, GOOG...whatever it takes. In case you haven’t noticed, congress has been FREAKING OUT the last couple of days. Why do they need to impeach him? Why did Nancy call Gen. Milley to make sure that Trump wasn’t going to do anything? Why do they want the 25th amendment? Because Trump won, and every member of congress who certified the fraudulent slates, every corporation that helped hurt Trump, they’re all going to be charged with Sedition. 

Don’t believe me? I don’t give a shit. I bought my positions on Thursday. Do you not see the writing on the wall? Trump is going nowhere.
Don't be jelly my guy. Use it as something to shoot for.
I agree. Here’s just a few more observations:

1. We aren’t having this discussion on TWTR. I’ve seen the numbers swell here on Reddit. 

2. Twitter was instrumental in fomenting the Arab Spring revolutions. Pepperidge Farm remembers Twitter’s active role in inciting violence, civil wars, and millions of deaths across several countries. Even as a Progressive, I can see the obvious biases they have against conservatives in the US.

3. Trump gave Twitter a huge pump. How many times did he almost started armageddon via Twitter. He dispensed insults against world leaders via Twitter. He was the candid loose cannon, unscripted, must-see, turnt up train-wreck that raised platform engagement. He has 80 mil followers compared to Biden’s 8 mil. You had to watch Trump tweet with the Statesmanship level of a mimosa drunk Real Housewife. Who cares what measured, PC, bland, focus group approved tweet Biden’s people will craft?
🚀🚀🚀🚀
Yes Tesla is a good example. last Monday you could have bought 1/8 800c for 60 dollars a contract. That’s 1200 bucks for 20 contracts. You could have proceeded to sell those on 1/8 prior to close for upwards of 166K Fuckin Tendies. Fuckin Euphoria. Fuckin 🍉
One of these days the Tesla stock will crash.

Aaanny day now.

Yup. It’s gonna be soon. We just have to wait.

Uh huh. Sure is good not buying on speculation.
ok i’ll fuck your mom
The best part is that it makes the people who don’t even know what day it is think they know what they’re doing, and makes the people who know what they’re doing question if they even know what day it is

Do you actually believe any of the things they said in today's propaganda presentation?

Fanduel is pretty slick and responsive, they gave me a bunch of bonus money so im still there, whats so great about draft kings? Havent used it.
Damn I hope they enter the USA market, those cars look sick
I think so. Priced in a tad bit.  I’m still pretty confident it can raise another 100 bil or so in market cap in the next couple months.
To the moooooooooon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Why are you selling. Do you need the money? Is Tesla future prospects affected? They are still in the beginning stages as a company and in five years 2000$ a share is going to be reasonable.
May drop after but definitely not before.

That’s what I was thinking, battery weight as the primary issue.
It sounds like you have a better background in this than I do. So everything I say you should take perhaps only as a fresh perspective. For further context, I haven't had resounding success in the market, but have spent (wasted? lol) a lot of time experimenting with lots of different methods and strategies on a small account. No real investing, just learning. As of this week, I am now positive again. So again, don't take anything I say with the weight you would someone more experienced (like your FIL) but here's what I've learned so far:

&#x200B;

* Never stop looking for plays.
* Keep a good bit of money in cash or convertible sources to take advantage of plays.
* Anticipate pullbacks even on your best picks and average-in (even with options).
* Never commit to expiration. Average out when the stock meets your goals.
* Consistency is key. If all else is equal all you need is a 51% win rate to be profitable.

&#x200B;

For your particular portfolio, you might consider holding a couple long-dated, ITM calls on ARK to give you the leverage of your shares while freeing up the rest of the money. When there's a fundamental pullback ARK is probably going down fast. Better to lose $1000s on an option than be a bagholder for 10 years. And, like you said the money could be better elsewhere.

Maybe instead of YOLOing into SPY OTMs you should project your price target out further and do a rolling entry into your OTM calls. What do you think it will be at in December? With OTMs you have the same risk from the market trading sideways as dropping, and we just did a significant leg-up and we might kiss $390 or $400 next week, but what if it stays there and spends another month accumulating. You'll make money near-term but have to roll them out and have this conversation again, lol. That .25-.75 gamma is where all the calls make their money the fastest, but if the market is doing a melt-up then it's worth it to hold ITM with the high delta and less stress.

Again, take it with a massive grain of salt, but this is my main thought process when using options on index vs elsewhere.
Position or ban. And tldr
This is why you need a specialised retail store 🚀🚀🚀. Saying I'm going to buy everything at Walmart or BestBuy but only the gaming section sounds retarded.
Yes.  Some random guy on CNBC said so.

While I'm not super sure about federal regulation of twitter (could definitely be a possibility) cause that's a real slippery slope. I think they're going to hit fb and twitter with lawsuits that won't succeed in breaking up or bringing down the business but to moreso regulate future business actions like aquisitions and such. 

However! I 100 percent agree that this trump buisness going to drop their user count like a stone. With bad fundamentals, bad press and a much less effective platform to advertise on than other social media platforms, I think you make a strong case for twitter puts.

Great analysis!

The world’s largest contract chipmaker said Friday that December sales totaled NT$117.4 billion ($4.2 billion). Revenue in the quarter reached a record NT$361.5 billion, according to Bloomberg News’s calculations based on previously released monthly sales figures. That came in slightly below the average estimate of NT$364 billion, which had risen in past months as expectations around the iPhone grew.” Think this was the news that caused the slight dip?
It's about personal risk tolerance. You've made 26x. Trying to extract more seems the height of greed. How pissed would you be if Tesla dips at any point? Not saying sell all by any stretch, but the saying that nobody ever went broke taking profit rings true here. There's so much positivity being priced into Tesla that I'd be comfortable paring down the position, letting half ride, book over a million in gains and think about how to invest the rest. Just my $.02.
tsm gonna gap up or what?
Mr Beast just posted a video about buying everything at a GameStop shop. Time to go back into GME? 🤡

I'll start:

* SE
* CRM (pullback from Slack but Slack will only help its enterprise suite)
* GME
* PLTR (enterprise data integration and analytics is poised to be the next big opportunity for them outside of govt)
* ICLN (biden admin likes green energy)
* CVS (dont understand this one but I dont want to be too heavy in tech and ARK has been buying CVS)
Never sell 🚀

They’re partially right. Banking profit is extremely valuable mechanism for building wealth. You should use all of your tools.
Or even how far it crashes if it does. A 10% correction from 880 and from 1500 are wildly different numbers.

Fuck it and buy NIO monday morning
benchpress PR?
EV accounted for 2% of car sales in 2020 and a fraction of 1% of cars on the road. Plus there's lots of stuff made from oil than gas. Plus even if EV took over 100% of the car market it would still be wildly overvalued. Plus that anticipates technological breakthroughs that haven't happened yet. Plus gas engine tech has advanced alongside EV.

You were saying?
If you sell, it’s going to moon. If you hold, it’s going to continue to tank. I’d sell.

#Private Equity broker legitimacy

There are multiple small brokers offering allocation in the current round of SpaceX, ending 1/15-1/31.

I have a group of private investors willing to invest, but need a way to validate the legitimacy of these companies, as well as the pricing we are getting.

Can anyone please respond if you can help guide us through this process.
It will go up... I’m not going to panic sell :)

Do you think Monday will be red because they didn’t announce big European moves at NIO day ?
Problem is, how far does it go up before it crashes down...
I suppose i should jump in again and lose my monies

Why would you hold these during the trending upwards movement? Swing trade puts if you have to do this.
Sell before the pop
🤑
sometime next week, my bet is monday or more likely tuesday will be start of pullback. If market is red, tesla will sell off. Will also depend on whether nio moons too since they had nio day today.
thats exactly what i did, turned 7k into 39k in 9 months. But the charts lookin a bit too pointy, i cashed out

Silver going up next week?
Had Trump won the election fairly? No they wouldn't. 
No matter how upset and angry they would have been, an attack on democracy would have furthered Trumps power. It would have proven him "right" and he would have done anything to make democracy his dictatorship. There would have been protests, yes. There would have been calls for the abolition of the electoral college in favor of a popular vote, and calls for more voting rights and access. But there would not have been an armed coup attempt. 
I also assume that had Trump won the election fairly he would not have lost GA and would have been much closer to control of the House as well.

Had he "stolen" the election by forcing legally cast votes to be thrown out, through a packed Supreme Court or one of his BS legal challenges that have almost all been universally thrown out? I can't say. I would like to believe not, but with all of the hurt and anger and the fear that has been instilled in the POC and LGBTQ+ communities 
Fear is a powerful motivation. I honestly think part of the reason so many people were let out of the Capitol without being arrested has to do with the fact that that last thing you want to do with a scared dangerous animal is back it into a corner. 

I try to ask myself how I would react if complete government control stolen by a group of people who want me dead or locked up or driven into a camp to be forced to convert my religion or sexual orientation. 
How would I react if I had been peacefully protesting and was still shot with rubber bullets and maced and then to top it all off, the only thing I could to to invoke change was stolen from me? 

I don't agree with the Coup attempt, but empathize with where their sentiment came from. If I apply that to the Democrats, I can't disregard the probability. 

The country is on the edge of a knife and I personally believe that there is a real possibility of a second civil war in the next 20 years.
You don’t like the 10 speed? I love it.

You're not alone...

It seemed like the market had to come to it's senses eventually with TSLA, but so far it's a big dicked NOPE.
Last time I was there I was snow boarding and hit my head so hard I don’t even remember the trip I remember taos mercy was an amazing hospital but everyone outside of it looked like an African village
I know we all love Tesla and we all know it will probably be a 5 trillion dollar company this decade. But cmon, puts make sense short term like this thing has to correct within 3 months pretty significantly. 

TSLA 850p 3/19

Exactly. Here I am with my student loan interest at 0 for 9 months so far, sitting on 170% investment gains for the year. If I followed their advice I’d have less debt but also lower net worth—the only number that actually matters in the equation, duh.
Please dont make the dumb mistake of thinking the stock is just gonna go up forever lul.
I’m worried that since they didn’t announce new European partnership that it will tank despite all the new announcements of their tech and services
You’ll get downvoted from the Tesla holders
Yes, vegas controls the offense and defense. That was just Pedersons ego brah. Buy the hook or tease it down

Classic pump and dump
It's not about maximizing your money, it's about having enough money to live the life you want. You could buy a pretty nice house and retire on this money if you're OK living on 50-100K a year. If that's enough to make you happy (which it should be), you can just sell now. Sure it might be worth more later, but would more money really make you more happy? Only a little. But retiring literally today could make you very happy.
Apologies to Maya Rudolph, but it look like Maya Rudolph
Sorry i do not know about it. Just a warning though, sometimes people buy into what buffet has for namesake alone, and end up losing because he often gets special shares and deals with better dividends etc.

If TSLA goes to $4000 before March 2023, which is a valid scenario, he would kick himself for leaving 8 million dollars on the table.

Selling covered Calls is not a simple money making move. Those call buyers also have a chance to make a lot. 

Those who actually sold TSLA covered Calls last year know how painful it was.

Thanks, makes sense. Sorry I am retarded. It will cost me around $1,500 to close the current spread, but then I get paid around $1200 to open the next spread- however of course I have to close the next spread again if the stock remains at its current price, which means I'll have an even bigger loss compared to if I just closed my spread now. Of course if the stock jumps back up then I will win big.
I cringe when I see threads celebrating hitting $50 a month in dividend income.

You’re not the first to short an overvalued Tesla and you won’t be the last
Think it will move at least +5 a month into the low hundreds and that’s being very conservative. The way this market is right now, it could recover 5 bucks in a week. They’re also holding an investor meeting sometime this upcoming week to sooth all the butt hurt away.

ok. Now for one of your stock tips since you are good at it!!! help a brother out
I missed the March runup on stocks that now trade at 100-200+ (Sq, Zm, Fvrr, etc). I'm up 198% since Sep 1 since I switched tactics and continue to mine for 10x'ers and extend the portfolio. Maybe GME will get there one day and prove me wrong...I hope it does since I have a few Jan '22 calls, but I'm not willing to stand around and wait while everything passes me by.
The premium is worth it. Theta burn means shit and if it reverts to any of its moving averages its an easy 100-200% play even with some IV crush
[removed]
Oh for sure. To act like there's one side whose extremists are worse than the other is ignorant as all get out
what do you guys think about investing in nio while shorting tesla? is this is a good hedge or are both similarly overvalued?
I know right
Exclusive? No? Then out of line.

Everytime some ANALysts make an assumption the opposite happens. So this is good news for GME. I think GME will dip after the ICR but bounce back.
Unban me on discord so I can type fuck you in the chat, please.
Circling back. Not sure your 17c will payout but i think your 15c will do well. How goes?

Exactly. And that is what Tesla hasn't even begun to figure out yet, but Waymo and GM are working on it.
No i think its a mini movie he paid to make he fights a bunch of guys
If you’re betting the spread, never bet the favorite
lol
This guy is so weird
The only correct response
TSLA is heading to 2,000 sorry buddy not sorry
Are you though? If Musk wants to get a trillion dollars to do a massive global company to do carbon recapture (and earn massive money from the credits) then he can do that by creating the "X" holding company for Tesla, SpaceX, Neurolink, Starlink, Boring Company, etc.

And at that point not only will he be reducing global CO2 but each share will be worth whatever a Mars city is worth. $10,000? $100,000? Remember how the holding company Berkshire Hathaway had (has?) $100,000 shares.
Meh I only had trouble for like a year cause I just got a super low limit card from my credit union and built up credit but idk I guess me and my friend and our parents assumed that having a 6 figure income could get you at least a average credit card or loan, shit they give credit cards to anyone with a pulse that makes 1/3 what I do. I mean multiple times I tried to finance things just to build credit and they said no so I just paid for it out of pocket which is retarded.

Doubt it will have an “infinity squeeze”, but there will be some sort of a short squeeze in around March if Cohen makes nominations. Share recalls to vote in June. Happened last year and it 2x’d in a week but those were at much much lower prices, happened at around $2.80

All the replies by OP have just confirmed he is indeed retarded. If you were actually smart OP you would sell some and diversify. There are other companies like Microstrategy that are returning 500% just by holding shares. But you’re too much of an idiot to see those opportunities. Hope it doesn’t crash while you’re bagholding.
That’s my only one for old oil. In energy in general, you probably’ve already seen people shilling ICLN. There is pdac-ws, spac from ceo of PLUG, under the radar play i have a position in. Also a few other new green energy spacs that will likely explode in a few months.
???? Debit spreads and credit spreads are super simple to learn lol
depends on the age. If X is the age in years, then I'd say you're "rich" with

(50.000•X + 500.000)$


This corresponds to $1.5m for someone that is 20 years old and to $3.5m for someone that is 60 years old.


Below that I'd call you "wealthy" but not "rich".
Big plays for Monday and the next week? Tesla? Clean Energy? Nio? Looking to throw a lot of money in
Open up your calculator and figure out what 20% of 2.6 mil is and then ask yourself if you wanna potentially lose that. Yeah, you can for sure keep gaining but we all know there’s more down than upside in the short term.

Besides, Odds are any limit under 50% is gonna be hit eventually anyway. Now is as good a time as any to take a little off the table. Sell covered calls on it at varying levels on the next Green Day. Don’t roll it.
Stocks didn't even give a shit about the capitol getting stormed in an attempted coup
Yeah but that play calling at the end is what really put the colts in the coffin. That was the most retarded shit ive seen. Happy for you though my old manager used to be a cheerleader for the bills back in the 90’s she is hot as hell still at like 40 i want to bone
No
So retard is still safe?
Chargers....??
Eventually, it will go up but we know all tech stocks are heavily inflated. Maybe money rotation will give tech stocks some breathing space and entry points.
That's assuming people want others in their cars. For those that already use uber to do as such I agree with that perspective. That doesn't change the fact that there is only so much market share you can have. TSLA will have to have Amazon levels of market share.
Someone has to
It’s not that we’re conditioned to hate our country or ourselves; it’s that we are conditioned to question all authority and not settle for the answers we are given. This breeds an environment where a natural pursuit towards accountability and consequence that largely benefit the greater population.
What do you do?
That 700 will not print.  03/19 maybe.

Love it. Only thing I will probably add is the year so it's clear what we're referencing by easiest bull ever hahahahaha.
I learned my lesson about betting the spread when the Eagles were down 14 vs Seattle on a -6.5 line. They score a go ahead TD with 12 seconds left, go for 2 FOR NO REASON, and lose by 6. 80%+ of money was on Seattle -6.5. Vegas is more corrupt than any Market Maker.
which is the place to learn spreads?
It has for the most part thankfully, definitely not back to 100% though

If a squeeze is happening best time to get in is when there is still skepticism about the squeeze happening. It’s still going to happen. Just like NIO day people were like”its priced in” lmao.  I think the squeeze will happen eventually especially with Cohen being involved but its not priced in yet because of too many people trying to time it and getting burnt.
Inclined to agree with this.  I have $1.9M including my paid off house, but with 3 kids headed to college I do not feel rich.  $1.1M more?  Probably...

Yeah because they aren't actually "left" as in 95% of democratic politicians are capitalists and everyone who doesn't have brain worms understands that lmao. Do you think dozens of billionaires who care about literally nothing but maintaining and expanding their fortune would be donating tons of money to democrats if they were actually a left party who wanted to give power to workers?
Put 100 down on the game against me then
Minus the devastation it caused, the story of Enron is pretty hilarious. They literally just created money out of thin air and everyone just believed them or helped them with the scam.


My personal favorite is that they booked all potential future earnings the day they signed a deal, so they'd say a 10 year deal worth a billion dollars was revenue they took in on day one. Oh, and they took down one of the Big 5 accounting firms. Seriously impressive.
Retard

I think so too. ARCT bounced back within a few days. I did further out calls just in case it takes them longer.

You should edit that to shameful, because you’re spouting nonsense. The 150 kWh version makes perfect sense and in no way indicates inefficiency. This is telling in the first place because electric motors are hard to purposefully make inefficient—electromagnetic fields are susceptible to far fewer external forces than chemical reactions. 

Here are the details:
TSLA = Model 3 75 kWh; NIO = ET7 150 kWh (double capacity)

Range: TSLA = 353mi/568km; NIO = 650mi/1000km (expected)
You don’t need to be an engineer (though I am) to recognize this is justification alone. But let’s go further. 

Power: TSLA = 450 hp; NIO = 650 hp
More power equals bigger motor and requires more capacity to compensate for any loss of range at the expense of bigger motor.

Load: TSLA = 4072lb; NIO = ?? (presumably heavier, but unless it’s much lighter, not important)
Honestly, it’s impressive that they are able to get this much out of the 150 kWh battery compared to Tesla’s usage of a 75 kWh.

While this may be a community of autistic retards, it’s not conducive to imbeciles. Sit down and shut the fuck up.

Well, my puts are only for two months, to be fair (and one week), but I think you're underestimating the regulatory risk here from intervening and basically showing that they're more powerful than POTUS in some regards.

So I buy at Open or nah
3/19 $120
By "not parroting the party line" they probably just mean "being a huge cunt to a lot of people and not having the self awareness to realize it". I've seen people say even super racist/homophobic shit and not get banned, most people people who get banned (especially more than once) are people who are consistently being assholes or trolls. I mean sure you can get report brigaded but like that doesn't happen that often really

true but Tesla has been "strong" as can be since  March so there have been plenty of times she could have "sell on strength" - I think her sell means she expects a dip. She knows stuff and she is very often right. There might be a Tesla dip coming or maybe a miss with earnings season coming up. She is still bullish long term and I think she has a 7k target for a few years or something for Tesla.
Looks like they made it in MS Word

From Chris Sacca’s twitter: Let’s be clear, the employees made this happen. Stock markets don’t care and pundits don’t move the needle. The biggest risk facing tech giants is losing talent. Their armchair-libertarian faux-intellectualism is all well and good until engineers don’t want to work there anymore.

The fact the everyone is saying we are in a bubble, means we aren’t in a bubble. Bubbles sneak up on you. Sure there’s some overpriced securities and asset prices are generally high, but rightly so: there is no alternative. When everyone turns a blind eye is when a bubble forms and pops, we aren’t there yet. Still room to run.

Honestly, you’re very delusional. As someone with a lot of money, you’re making a very stupid decision not selling here. Tesla will not remain this high this year under a democratic president. Please open your eyes and sell the shares. Invest in dividend paying stocks and literally retire.....

There’s a reason the funds are selling tesla.....
And even if Twitter is part of the public sphere it doesn’t mean your views are required to be allowed in the public square.

Trump doesn’t have the right to say what he wants on Twitter. 99.99999% of people don’t have this issue. The irony of this is that the less Trump talks and says the more electable he is. Funny how Twitter banning him saves him from his dumbass self

I know this guy; he means it literally. Just ignore him. No one has that much endurance. It’s like 4 trillion people.
You are correct. I just think that’s exceedingly unlikely. I’m guessing TSLA will be either under $500/share or over $1500/share by then. Which way, I honestly couldn’t tell you.

not sure but she has been selling Tesla daily. Sure, you may be right that it could be a % of her position but I think Tesla hit the target that she had predicted for Jan 2021 so maybe she is expecting a dip and then will get back in.  I think she has a target of $7000 in a few years or something.

No, you have to be more specific as to what you mean:

I was thinking 10% OTM in a year or more ? Too conservative?
The 3 year chart is pure retardation.  It will have a big drop.  I expect it will hit 1000 and sell off around 30 to 60%.
I mean, id say the catch is no wheeling for poors unless you got a high risk tolerance. Maybe less so this year with retard pump, but eventually you're gonna be bagholding shares far below what you paid, if you want to make any money then you got to have enough to diversify and average down so you're not bagholding the whole portfolio.

But yea, past that wheeling is the shit

That means there no longer any restrictions in day trading (for ibkr in europe)
a) If you have a margin account with less than 25kUSD your day trades were restricted with the PDT rule. Now you can day trade as much as you want - doesnt matter how much money you have.
b) If you had a cash account you had to wait for your funds to settle (2 days). you couldn't just buy stocks immediatly after you sold them. Now you can day trade to your hearts content!!!!

If you believe in chart patterns, support, resistance, astrology, etc... There's big resistance at $33, but if the squeeze pushes past that it could move into the low $40 range pretty easily without heavy resistance until low $60 (ATH).

$100+ only possible if Cohen truly redefines GMEs income stream and captures a unique market position. That's more likely a 3-5 year scenario, not a short squeeze target.

1. House Republicans are moving on from Trump fast, ain't gonna wallow and draw attention to it.

The move was an attempt at self regulation to stave off government regulation. It probably means less likelihood of government intervention.

2. Yes, lots of companies are like this.

Honestly didn’t know Elon had a son named Saxon. What an Anglo Saxon thing to do.
Ya it was good. Even buying the dip Friday was good too.
Anything’s possible, but the company reeks of steady, consistent sales to boomers, non-fashionable gen x’ers, and poors. The type of thing that has some old guy yelling “we sell underwear, not hip hop shoes dammit!”

Some influencers might be shilling, but that means they’re getting paid. If that doesn’t pan out into growth, they’re going away. I just don’t see it happening. I might just be stuck with my perspective from 15 years ago, but without serious rebranding all the cool gen Z’ers are going to be hearing about how grandpa used to buy that brand to play squash and it only cost a nickel.
Tesla for one.

No problem. I bet with the NIO/NVDA news, TSMC is only going to become more valuable going forward. Apple earnings are definitely going to help TSMC going forward. I can see TSM hitting 130 by March/April. Maybe even further. 

Also, unusual call volume for 1/15 130 and 135Cs that were picked up at this dip.
There are no March calls.

Father in law is a retired CPA with a 7 figure portfolio. He's one of my best buds so we actively discuss markets and potential moves on a daily basis. He is pretty risk adverse for someone his age,100% equities. All money from my account belongs to me and my wife.

&#x200B;

Seriously appreciate the time put into your response. Hadn't really considered ITM calls. I bought into arkk last year, averaged to $90. That's where this money comes from. Considering selling my arkk to do something like this with the proceeds. My goal for the year is to hit 150k, currently built up to 68k. ARKK and ICLN have been my best friends this past year, but I'm not sure if Keeping 78 shares of ARKK will allow me to reach my goal this year. It feels like the 11k could be utilized better on something else.

&#x200B;

At the same time though I'm not sure how necessary it is to take on this risk. 11k loss would be a substantial setback being 20% of my holdings. But I don't want to be a pussy either, bull market must be taken advantage of. Then again, it's only 4-5% of networth if I look at our assets as a whole.
Congrats you saved 1/2 people. 

Some need to have their accounts blown up to learn. Those who don't will go straight to tendie town thanks to people like you.
Trying to determine how close we are to the top. You have meek mill Tweeting about learning the stock market and I’ve been getting hit up more and more by friends who want to learn “how stocks work”

Lol I don’t know. The answer is probably a lot more nuanced than the simplistic question you asked so the answer is probably a little over your head. Maybe we should find a group of people who are really passionate about this, have them dedicate their entire education to follow a strict and testable methodology for determining this. Oh wait that’s science, but since the orange man said it’s “bad” it can’t be trusted!!!!

Already got in positions at this week`s Dip for AAPL as well. Still a lot of time left, maybe another dip to add more.
I was always under the impression that this was a long hold. I can wait patiently on my messily 20 or so shares. I believe in the technology they are pushing. Plus that Albert Einstein hair gives me confidence in his brain power!
Yep
Call volume on TSLA was huge this week.  $600 Stim checks coming... new price target is around $1400.

Was in that position myself for years (but no pain) and can say, in my experience, it's only going to get worse. There will come a time when it doesn't make you feel better and/or you're always chasing that feeling, like any drug. If you're questioning your habits now, there's a reason for it. And I completely understand, I can personally rationalize any decision I make (what's the point of not drinking if I'm miserable when I'm sober (in your case, in pain), how is drinking any different than being on a pharmaceutical, etc.). I've gone without for over a year now and can definitely say it's one of the best decisions I've made. In any case, hope you find some peace about it, just remember the longer you go, the harder it's going to be to make a change.

Honestly sell right as it goes at 1 trillion dollars of value. As absurd of a valuation that would be, I think it will the last milestone that the stock will reach before no more investor will want to pour more money into it.

I don't know from a data standpoint, but am betting on retail investors continuing to come in. Then it's just a numbers game where a big grouping of small accounts, influenced by sites like WSB, will influence movement when they all make similar moves. And some of those will survive and take an interest in learning how to not lose it all. But with "influencers" talking about it, I think people will routinely put more of their available money into the market until enough people fail and new regulations are pushed through by lobbyists to "protect the people." The house will always win, but I think it will be shaken up a little.
Only regret I have with arbkf is that I'm too poor to buy more shares

So Tesla's are cool and all, but the interior is so bland compared to Mercedes especially.

I really hope they step their game up because once there is competition, who is going to chose a basic Ikea style interior over the traditional German luxury cars??

Oh I read your comment, but just because your organization is shitty and your boss pressures you to fake activity doesn’t mean that happens everywhere. Sounds like you work for dickheads.

Good god you aren’t lying. I’ve never looked in there before your comment and honestly depressing. “Where to invest $100 and not touch for 40 years” paraphrasing but shit, insanely depressing over there.
I work in oil and gas  my company is already starting to transition to renewable sources. This is a part of their 20 year plan and they are trying to get ahead of the pack. Power infrastructure, LNG, power recs, wind power and solar power plants are all part of the plan. Energy companies are recognizing what is needed to survive so its not like they are going to site their and let these new startups put them out of business.
Or maybe we just realize that some social policies are actually good for the economy and instead of getting all butthurt about it we like making money?
Visiting this sub today is bringing back memories of what it was like here end of January 2018.  I don’t enjoy reading sob stories of newbies getting wiped out.  Mebbe just mebbe you might want to not be all in right here when we are at peak optimism while market breadth continues to deteriorate.  You will make way more money and make your year shortly by buying meme stocks after a 50% haircut.

If you’re looking for actual advice, then if you’re confident in your positions and buying shares then just buy and don’t try to time it for short term gains. I own ICLN and all of the ARKs in my rollover IRA that is for longterm holds, so I would buy whenever. Options, if you think its going up then yolo. Don’t be a bear.

2.5 million cars sold in 2020. i like to remind myself how far tesla is from traditional auto makers, and from time to time these numbers put it in perspective.

batteries and that stuff are great, but the only real value the operation can deliver to support current prices is solving AI-driving. even if solved tomorrow, is probably a couple years from legislatively being permitted. 

in fairness, i wouldn't buy GM either, they appear to be way behind the curve and to have a long uphill battle to stand in the future with EV's.

Yeah not with a single stock portfolio, banks won't consider that stable collateral. If you had a well diversified and stable portfolio then sure, but this isn't that, this is betting on a bubble. A bubble which will burst eventually, tesla isn't successful to the level of their stock price and people will realise that. Maybe it goes a little higher, maybe it doesn't drop of that much, but dude sell and have almost $2 million.
I did a bit of "research" and found a few things to check out for yourself of you are interested in GOEV, I only skimmed a bunch of random articles without checking sources

Hyundai Motors (and Kia) double down to invest $87 billion into GOEV over a span of 5 years to develop smart electric vehicles, with an ambitious goal of over 25% of total auto sales being electric vehicles by 2025

Hyundai Motors just acquired an 80% controlling stake in the creepy robot company Boston Dynamics

Hyundai is working with Apple on "Project Titan", an electric vehicle project. Will GOEV be involved with Apple's smart car?

Apple's smart car is projected to hit consumers in 2027, and be sold as an "experience" that changes our perception of auto travel. Think if Steve Jobs achieved ipod level creativity and success with electric vehicles

BlackBerry has entered a deal with GOEV to produce for their cars the ADAS (Advanced Driver Assistance System) aka the computer/software of the car

Now imagine it's 2027, and the first fleet of autonomous, electric smart cars hits the streets. Branding by Apple, sold by Hyundai, designed by GOEV, programmed and secured by BlackBerry.

Subscription based smart electric vehicles.

Personally, I’d sell 30 $1,000 3/19/2023 calls at $340 a pop, pocket just over 1mm, and keep holding them. This way, best case you walk away with just over 4mm in 26 months, worst case you walk away with 1mm even if TSLA goes bankrupt.
I've found a majority of the time when lefties accuse others of doing something they are the ones actually doing it. You can call supporting Trump a cult all you want, but your on a side that punishes the slightest dissent from your narrative like someone commited heresy.

Good liquidity, less risk

Your broker *should* exercise both if you bought them as a spread in the same transaction. Sometimes there can be a delay in that actually showing up. You can call and ask if you’re concerned. I know there are issues with Robin Hood (I don’t use it, I use Fidelity) on proper execution of spreads. 

Yes, I was referring to the possibility of an execution and assignment on the short leg because it is so far ITM with not a lot of time before expiration. It’s not guaranteed of course but it is a possibility. If it were assigned then your fate would be sealed on this particular play, but shit happens. 

Regarding the long leg helping, it was in regards to rolling. You have a profit on that part of your spread and both legs are ITM. So I was referencing the fact that you at least have the credit from that leg if you roll. 

A $300 loss is far better than a $1,500 loss! It’s theoretically possible to roll things out long enough to potentially turn a profit eventually but the market would have to cooperate. But even a $300 loss is so much better.

Meanwhile, companies like SpaceX went from testing little rockets to building the largest rocket ever.

And to say hes just a VC is such an narrow view of things. Theres a reason why it was him up there with Schmidt, and not some random VC. Hes well respect and for good reasons.

No it isn't. It is needed to compensate energy overloads on some, and not enough produced energy on other days, which is a product of a fully on renewable energy based economy. Its not that efficient currently, but new electrolysis methods which also use the generated heat, already bring somewhat more.

yeah pretty much. its how i make money while still being able to sleep at night and focus on my job during the day. I entered this ARKG trade around a month ago and up 65% so far on the options part. I also bought shares and up like 10% on those lol.
I appreciate you actually answering. I realize I'm dumb lol
Well. It’s not OPEN profit/loss anymore, is it?
What’s a circle jerk?
2/19 $30C x 25 here.
I would expect volatility to be pretty high still on Monday
They censored iran now too. Anti Iranian bastards!

Safer. But I’m all in on O.E.G for my solar play. Gonna make it my NIO that takes me out of poorville
NIO calls retarded this week or is there still time to ride that 🚀

Leaps are fine too, just higher risk - I’m not a big fan of NIO’s fundamentals, so I would buy shares to be safe

You doing okay man? Lotta anger here...
Really?? Alright that’s the one. I love movies but started that one a few years ago and got distracted so I stopped watching. Excited to see if I have a different opinion on it now
I’m balls deep in these too so no I don’t think it will because I don’t want it to
agree
Crash is confirmed.. But how much and when ?
Thanks for this, I just looked them up. I think I actually saw a documentary once about this company before the name change. It was a smear piece, but tasers are not the controversy that they used to be. The new segments sound cool. I may just pick it up.
Really annoying how when you sell on the ToS app it takes away from my total P/L open. Or am I wrong?
QS?
Then why do you go on it?
Bro just illegally move to the us.  Republicans say that you can move and also get free healthcare and even vote in elections.  /s
The data ist completely wrong. Volkswagen and Daimler have never been over 100 bn. marketcap. I don‘t know where you got that from, but thats complete BS and misleading
Roku up 23% this week because they acquired a failed company. Ok makes sense.
FAKE
Ya I would get puts on a Silicon Valley company that moved to texas
I panic sell my NIO call🤡🤡🤡🤡why am I that dumb
The market doesn't care about reality.
Would it be foolish to add to my ICLN and ARK positions on Monday? Or should I wait for a dip?
market crashes so bad on monday like really bad sell everything!
Ya ruint it.

I actually got a good deal. I let it grow in because I read online that once it goes past the gum line it's a lot easier to take out. If you need an oral surgeon it's $800+. Because mine grew in past the gum line they just numbed me and yanked it out. Total cost was $345. Fucking gain dude.

Edit: I also knew mine would grow in properly, but I didn't have space so I let them grow in. There are risks if they don't grow in the right direction - in which case the $800 could save you from having a health emergency. Just FYI.
Even if TSLA pulls back this week, won't money start rotating into FANG stocks because earnings at the end of the month? Thus, preventing a dump.

True, but a lot of companies have seen their debt numbers skyrocket over the last ~10 years, and have pursued foolish policies like stock buybacks when presented with the opportunity to pay some of that down. At some point, the Fed is going to turn the easy money music off, and a lot of folks are going to be left with out a chair to sit in.

$NIO Jan 2023 $85 Leaps.. or just shares? What’s a better play?
420, again, you will never see my friend. If it drops(which i think it will im gonna take the money and run too) it gonna go to low sixes or maybe fives, but realistically Tesla is now at the brink of truly scaling their business with the introduction of the 25000 car, increased battery performance, Drastically scaling down of the size of manufacting equipment, Biden spending likely hundreds of billions of dollars to build EV charge stations nationwide, and California banning the sale of ICE vehicles, you are going to start seeing Teslas growth become parabolic and  narrow the grand canyon size P/E ratio.Im only selling because WSB finally seems shook.
If it drops, im buying more
I stopped over for a visit there in November
What can a few conservatives do to shake the market?  Are they going to storm the NYSE and CBOE and stuxnet NASDAQ?  Biden cancelled his live inauguration. Civil War only happens if you have two elite cabals opposing each other and the uniparty is strong in the USA.
Also, you can move brokers without selling by transferring the shares directly. Will save a ton on capital gains tax for now

Can’t help but notice that sentiment regarding all this has been shifting recently.

I’d say connected internet changed the world in early 2000s and led to companies like apple becoming the behemoths they are.  What will be the next event like that 5-15 years from now? I’m thinking it will be full automated driving that lets you sit in your car worry free and it will take you to your destination while you nap/work/etc in the car. Like a connected system that has fully autonomous vehicles dropping people off at their destination and then coming back to pick them up.  This isn’t about EV or battery tech, it’s about the software that runs it all without a glitch.  Thoughts on this? What companies out there could lead that space to develop that software? I know tsla is probably going to be in the middle of all this. But what else.
NVTA leaps yes or no
Totally get your comment about big plays. But yeah, that’s the goal
Lol except u can't buy it on RH
That is not true because the tax rates themselves are different for long term and short term capital gains. 

If these gains are less than 1 year old then he will pay out the ass to realize them.

If the decrease in value plus the long term tax rate is lower than the short term tax rate alone, then you come out ahead by holding even though the stock value has dropped.

Got kind of a funny dilemma. I like going for walks around the downtown of the city I live in. I don’t like going for walks during the day because it’s too active. Too many people and a lot of noise. The city is a lot prettier to walk around at night, but I always get hassled by homeless people. Never gotten mugged and get to occasionally see a street fight so it’s not too bad but still pretty annoying.

Little advice on rolling? So I’ve got Feb $23c on MT that I picked up last month.. Think I should roll this up to a higher OTM Feb strike or maybe March? I’m thinking Feb $26ish as I’m expecting an earnings run up. Also holding Jun $30c and VALE March $21c.

I buy OTM calls that are a few weeks out and then hope the movement up is enough to overcome theta decay. I only see about 10-30% gains, though on that strategy. I'm also not so fucking autistic that I blow my whole wad on TSLA calls. 

Then again, I was comparing notes with a guy who I would consider to be a professional gambler, and he sent me a screenshot of his 29,000% increase. He made $2,000,000+ off a single call, so maybe I'm the dumb one.

I sold some cc's too about a month ago, higher strike, but I think you will be good...no factory announcement and no talk of expansion may cause a bit of sell the news. I'm long on nio,,very bullish, but we just went from low 40 to about 60 in 2 weeks, bound to be some profit taking imo. 
Also, it would have to above 67 for you to lose anything on your cc's...i don't see it.
I can sympathize with this post. I'm not sure if this is your  🌈🐻 father in law's money since you bring him into it, or what his background is in the markets. Most people are never taught any real economic relativity principles and aren't equipped for being comfortable with risking 1000's in that market. 

Here's a chart I found in tradingview that explains some of the rationale: 

[https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPY/9630q53N-Why-the-Storming-of-the-Capitol-doesn-t-matter-to-the-markets/](https://www.tradingview.com/chart/SPY/9630q53N-Why-the-Storming-of-the-Capitol-doesn-t-matter-to-the-markets/)

Most people have this mistaken view that they can't lose if they don't play, but just by holding cash, they're gambling (except they never win, only lose). Everything is linked together and the asset price inflation that has made wsb tards rich has had an effect on the market. Most people think that because milk isn't $10 a gallon and gas is cheap that there's no inflation. But according to $dxy the dollar has lost 8.5% since March. It's amazing how when you look at the correlation between the market and the dollar the numbers start falling into place. The dollar value is inverse to the market in many ways. Are you really going to go to the store this and notice that groceries are 8% more expensive than it was in March? No.

Anyhow, if you're going to be investing in options doing OTM stuff is tempting, but YOLOing is called YOLOing for a reason. You might only get to do it once.

Using options might not have to be that risky. You get highly leveraged gains by spending the extra money on back-dated ITM calls. A deep ITM call and you get near the leverage of 100 shares for 2% of the cost. Something to consider. 

Take a look back at the dips in SEPT OCT. You can really see the money supply at work pushing the market higher despite troubling economic news. Compare that to the swings into the 350s and 360s, post-vaccine. We've been running about a $10 accumulation channel on the SPY and then this past week we got our leg up. 

I want to mention how volatile things are with this much money in the market. The mere reminder that the FED will have to mess with the Bond market and the 10 years breaching 1% caused a selloff. This is a bubble that everyone is aware of and they are ready to overract to any financial news.

Also, look at plays on some other ETFs like the ARK family. I don't know if you're familiar with Sven Carlin. [Watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-9cakgSIKTg) to understand why actively managed etfs can do so well when money is cheap. Essentially they can bid up their own prices. ARK is the best example of this because they specialize in small-cap stocks and literally own 5-15% of dozens of companies. They acquire shares in new ones but a lot of the capital goes right into their existing picks driving their value up further. This isn't shady, it's just the way it works and it's exaggerated because of the small-cap strategy that ARK uses. Of course, the reverse is true and when they have an outflow they're stocks will drop.

Hard to say. I had 1/8 3225c that obviously expired worthless. Seems like there would need to be some type of catalyst for it to gap up. Does look like it found some support around 3145 so it’ll be interesting to see if that is tested again

 I side with Burry here, why? because no 1 has dared to really F with tesla... Yet.

It's coming, you won't know how/when but it will happen because there's too many gaping holes in the company and it's attitude/performance to actually be stable as a company. I certainly expect there will come a time where other billionaires/corporations are willing to open the flood gates and pay to access/find D0 exploits/hacks and tank the living hell out of the company.

Maybe it's bias, but openly advertising you can access and update software on your entire fleet of vehicles also means it's entire fleet of vehicles could be dead in the water/cause wrecks from 1 hacker group on the fly.

Tesla openly flaunting this indefensible risk while hedge funds/tech companies ignore it is a huge admission of irrational exuberance. In my opinion, to continue to hold TSLA on their balance sheets is reckless and idiotic at best.

For the record I hold Zero in TSLA and have considered buying puts on them several times before. To believe there are not major threat's posed to people of the world via AI/automated products used blindly because of hype and FOMO is reckless.

Are you implying there will be a supply / demand issue? that’s not good.  They are ramping up production i believe.

Get as much tail as you possibly can. It’s natural to miss your ex, hit that too if you can. Money and bitches. Live it.
U seen one?
Lol this is how it goes lol
I looked at the prices this morning. It seems I can roll out one week to the same strike price, such that the original credit and this credit is about $1200. I'm really hoping it remains like that on Monday- then I could have about a $300 loss instead of of a $1500 loss per contract. I'm a fool for not clearly examining this on Friday before the market closed. Hopefully I don't get early exercised this weekend.

> Your long leg could help on that front

Could you elaborate on that?

> I’d imagine this could be a big assignment risk and that would lock in the losses.

Do you mean that you think because the current contract is so deep itm that someone might want to exercise and thus lock in my $1500 per-contract loss, before I get the chance to roll it out to lower my losses?

Another question I had, what exactly happens if I get assigned? I'm hoping my broker is smart enough to automatically exercise my long leg and then cancel out the assignment from my short leg, as opposed to giving me a bunch of short stock at $115 and then making me manually exercise my long leg later in the day. Do you happen to know? If it matters, I did purchase the long and short leg in the same trade (Schwab has a "spreads, straddles, etc" user interface where you can put in two legs at once that get exercised at the same time), so I imagine my broker knows that the two legs are related to each other...

I know someone who is retired and wants to put thousands into SCON because "it's so cheap and might be worth $100/share one day."

It closed yesterday at $0.84....
I would argue that those outlets are not more powerful than twitter.  Many people dont watch the news or even care about it, twitter is many people's primary news source. Why go watch some dude on CNN tell you what happened when you can go directly to the source?

The convenience alone makes twitter a more powerful platform

Just saw that NIO uses NEDC which was last updated in 1997. TSLA uses WLTP which was introduced in 2017 and is the modern EV range standard. Suppose NIO delivers 680miles using NEDC, one can divide it by 1.4 to convert to WLTP criteria. This gives me only 485miles. I mean whatever!!!

Why would they stop posting about it then?
They probably come from a period where they have solid pensions and never had to invest. My in-laws are the same way, cash is king, but they have checks rolling in every month.
I said I would buy in when it split. I didn't and that's a 60% bumped on that since then. People keep buying it triggering the bots to buy more driving the price. I wouldn't be surprised it goes back to 2k again and get split.
Certainly since Enron and most certainly since Dodd-Frank it is impossible to commit corporate fraud nowadays because every member of the C Suite, the Board, the auditing firm and the law firm would get punished by the SEC.

Suits was on “Network” tv, like what you just see on regular cable. Channels like USA, TNT, TBS, etc. Those have stricter rules for language and other content. 

Mr. Robot is from Amazon I think? Or Hulu? Either way, streaming services and premium channels like HBO, Showtime, etc. Have much less content restrictions.

When do you sell?
I recommend you do a lot of research before you start trading options. 

Start with the basics, what's a call what's a put, volatility, at least learn delta and theta for the Greeks. 

This will help you out tremendously and save you from taking losses that are just rookie mistakes.

I wish you the best of luck!

Wow.

oh fuck
Good opportunity to buy more
Should I sell 12k worth of ICLN calls to go all in NIO calls at market open? Feel like I can make way more in the short term with this, then hop back into ICLN
what did your inlaws say was a better idea?
I got suspended for using a naughty word thats rhymes with bags.

I'm so far in to $GME that all I have left is $ROPE. I want revenge on the cucks at Melvin and not selling a share until it fucking moons. GME pleas fly again
Not worried until premarket on Monday
Watch Southpark if you want to really see the extreme side of this.

2180 shares... theres me with half a share. Damn.
Indeed. Well I already bought them, and they’re sitting quite nice especially since I bought on hella red days. So yeah they expire this week, but I got them about a month or so out. My plan is to ride any momentum in the AM, take profits and bounce.

The average person knowledge of the stock market is absurd. I just got shat on by my inlaws because I conveiced my wife to put some money in index funds for her retirement. If you look at the graphs, it literally only go up.

No, it would not. Not even close

Obvious answer. Stay home and cry over your ex.

I was joking lol I feel like a million is plenty to cash out on though. Seems like a common theme here, people amount to getting huge sums of money but it’s still not enough for them then they get hit with a huge percentage in loss. Hope it works out for you though

Dont listen to them. 27th is earnings pump. You'll probably see 3 million. Hold then sell 1 hour b4 market close
Looks back last year when the entire country shut down and the market was in shambles. I was 100% thinking we would see another violent leg down, now I'm not so sure. Tsla dips get eaten up so fucking fast it's just ridiculous. On top of this, there are a shitload of people like you waiting on the sidelines for this inevitable crash. I just see no fucking way (aside from Elon dying or tsla completely fucking their company up) that buyers allow this to dip sub $500. Personally I'll be loading the fuck up if we see $600 again, or when we see it again.
Should I sell all my shares and buy $3000 2022 calls
$60 1/15s bought a while back.

just because you use an example from a company that committed fraud doesnt mean you are saying the company being compared is committing fraud.

Mr Robot is a USA show and they use the word "fuck" without censoring it (when streaming on amazon prime)

Suits is also a USA show and they use the word "fuck" but each time they do the dialogue goes silent (and also sometimes an extra will hilariously walk right in front of the camera to block the speaker's mouth from view) and it's kind of weird (also when streaming on amazon prime).

was thinking about that.. at the very least TSLA's moat isn't as extreme as the market cap differential indicates
Sales for GME have only gotten worse over time, I know it’s a meme stock but the only thing they have over other companies is that you can trade them a brand new $60 game for $12.99 store credit.
I have 6/18 $35 strikes on QQQJ. So not a bad play at all to grab those $31 or $33 calls either.
Part 2 was so fucking good, that world design is top tier. And the story is second to none.

Twitter is run by woke leftists who thinks mango is H*tler. This wasn't a calculated risk. This was a move based on ideology. The decision makers did this to "do the right thing". They would go through with it even if financial advisors advised against it. 

Stocks do only go up, but if you also hold the opinion that stocks are close to correcting, this isn't such a bad play especially if you think Trump's ban is a negative catalyst unique to Twitter.

I say this is a 50/50 play. But the downside is low (can TWTR go past 50?) and upside is high (stock correction + financial impact of Trump's ban).

Going to monitor how the market react ofc, but I'll buy some puts starting on Monday to hedge my much bigger long position.

You already know. Got in at 99
NVAX sure likes taking their time with these results. I played thetagang + shares on this one and it seems to be paying off since they are taking longer than anyone expected. I would love to nail a weekly right before the results are released but I'm losing faith in my ability to time it. I really thought they would've released results by now. 

Current positions are 2 credit put spreads + 47 shares. Strikes are 115/95 for February expiration and 105/85 for March expiration.

Premiums for put spreads are great - you can almost get a 1:1 risk/reward on spreads.
Why so?
Did u just do that on 2k

Buy ARKG leaps for as far out as you can. Buy them 50% OTM. THat is 20% of your money. Wait for the price of ARKG to come down because it fluctuates. When it comes down by 5% at least, buy another contract or two, one the same as the other one, and the other for 6 months out and 30% OTM. Take the rest of your money and do the same thing over the next couple of weeks. Spreading your bets over time means you can average in to positions so you dont all in at the top. Buying leaps gives you time to get out and it still goes way faster than stonks. Mixing it up between different strikes and expirys allows you to take on more risk in some of your positions to juice returns when you think you're at a good dip to buy on. 

Thats it. Then don't worry as much.

I just hope NIO day wasn’t a sell the news type of thing. I see it 80+ before summer though.
I agree. I was bullish on NIO last week and am bullish on NIO long term but I don’t see how holding calls over the weekend could be profitable come Monday. IV was insane and just had a pretty good run up last week into the event.  Definitely will be loading up on some calls Monday/Tuesday when those who held over the weekend dump when it opens flat or just slightly up/down.

Don't know to be honest. But I find degiro really expensive for options, when it even has them.

I haven't found IB expensive at all, and it gives me all the US options and ARK etc. No complaints at all.

Never had a fever, and never lost my sense of taste. Thank goodness for that as well considering I’m a chef.

8% utilization overall
Don't you mean a "relevation"?

Not straight up enough
My friend who works at tesla, immediately sells 50% of his stock when it vests at this level because he wants to realize the gains. He foresees a moderate to large correction. I’d do something similar even if its 50, 40, 30, 20% that you convert to something else to spread out your risk.

Yep. I bought my 2002 S2000 with the factory hardtop for $19,000 back in 2017(69K miles). I thought that was crazy money but it continues to go up in value. They're a blast to drive. Keep in mind, they do consume oil so check it regularly.

Maybe you subconsciously inverses yourself and it will end up being the right play all along.
Length if credit history gets averaged in. Since the new card  is at 0 it gets averaged with the other. 

If you closed the other CC— then that history gets ‘deleted’
Good bot
Yeah but shouldn’t be *that* much... I thought maybe like a 10 point drop or something not 85
He might have sold because he knows a crash is coming and he's taking his gains now. He isn't selling tesla though so that seems good. P/E ratiod are getting to dot.com bubble level rn, it's gotta burst sometime.
I've got 2k to YOLO, how do I get my tendies? I was thinking TSLA puts but I'm kinda retarded.
At least you guys have a long history of winning. I wouldn’t worry too much Steelers seem to find a way
100 USD till mid 2020. Here we go !
What’s a good stop loss amount?
I think Tesla will go back to sub $100 in the next 5 years. When FSD becomes regulated it will also become mandatory it won't be a service it will be a mandatory safety feature like a seatbelt. No way they will get to charge $50-200 per month at best they will get a few bucks from every vehicle sale and they won't be the only ones with self driving software in 5 years.
It's a 30 yr old plane not MAX.

Only idiots would sell on this...or retards. 🤔

How much does your credit typically dip with a new card? I went from 790 to 705 over 3 months with under 30% utilization....only thing that changed was the new card...

I always roll some amount of my YOLO gains into something tangible that I never sell. On dips, I add to these positions. I am 32. When I am 65, I will not be making YOLO plays anymore. I will be selling OTM calls on companies that will have split multiple times. Imagine being retired, looking at your portfolio maybe once a month, and generating passive income while you do whatever the fuck you want. Then imagine making one stupid mistake after another 5 years from now, and being back to square one with nothing to show for it, having paid taxes for years on gains that are lubing someone else's cock now.

If you got assigned on a covered call, start selling cash-covered puts.  

This way, you make money on your cash. And if you get assigned, you got shares at a lower price than buying them at market. Win-win for you

I think you’re pretty wrong on this one. The backlash from conservatives might last for a month, but they met a ton of their conservative friends on Twitter. They’re not just gonna leave those friends and that community.

Buy the dip.

If you wanna go short on a stock long term it should be something like Roku, Zoom, Docusign and other stocks that are painfully clearly bubbled. Twitter really isn’t that far up from pre-covid in comparison.

"99% of scientists believe" science isn't fucking beliefs shit. Its not 4 out ofn5 dentists reccomend colgate. Actual science has been completely perverted by the leftist cult. Where you cant even question it. Thats the entire point is questioning things and attempting to disprove them.
You guys are so delusional. Like listening to an 11 year old
Most plans prohibit you from contributing if you rollover to an IRA
It will weaken temporarily but it won’t even matter. You think banks and the fucking Fed are going to allow wealth to just diminish? Do you even understand the correlation between USD strength and the interest rate raise/lower cycle on top of annual population rises vs available currency? Or did you not learn about that while pursuing your degree in becoming a professional YouTube watcher?

The trump coalition without Trump is a whole different animal, something that might actually be something worthwhile. 

What it is, with Trump, is a steaming pile of double-speaking, bullying, cronyist, corrupt "swamp-people". 

Without Trump, it will be the conservative version of the Bernie movement. He inspired millions and is the antithesis of Trump, but him and his kind are not necessarily the antithesis of the "Trump coalition minus Trump". Trump will be another talking head, a big one at that, but nothing more. Others with conservative populist stances will be, hopefully, more rational and issue oriented. If you think Trump gives a shit about the issues he ran on, you're mistaken. How's the trade deficit with China going? How's that wall along mexico going? How's the coal jobs doing? How's American manufacturing doing? How's the world's opinion on the state of America doing?

Its means that on April the 16th, for 19 Consecutive hours there will be a Going to the Moon Event.
yeah im both but looking at the comparison on returns its just stupid. Like I put 10k into shares of ARKG and around the same time put 10k into OTMs quarterlies and leaps of ARKG. The stock play is up like 10% and the option play is up 65%. so I made 1k from stocks and 6.5k from options. If it was all in options I wouldve made much mroe.

I had the same thought after the crash this spring. Nothing is really safe. The reason why they want the average person to just be invested is because that’s what makes the markets and that’s what provides the money for the funds to invest.
Tesla sold 500,000 cars in 2020 for approx 30B.
It is safe to say to that soon enough it is going to sell 5M cars for 300B.
Do you know of any other company that is about to grow it’s revenue 10 times in the next 5 years?

Even if they just sold in gyna it’s probably still worth more than it’s current price.
i never said i think its going to 1k, and i don't know where it's going

what i said is, that for me to assume there might finally be a top in, i'd need to see a huge day over day move + ginormous volume jump

i'm trying to find a setup, where payout on options is at least 20 to 1, so even if i end up being right 1 out of 10 times i'd do well overall

obviously i missed everything on the upside due to being too old and pessimistic, but i ask myself, in tesla case specifically, what happened to volume when the stock did retreat a bit

look at beginning of feb 2020 volume jump, beginning/mid july 2020 volume jump, end of sept (battery day jump)  and the most recent sp500 inclusion volume jump. The best opportunity to make money on puts was actually the end of sept, which i did only on the minimum size because i wasn't confident, hoping for more volume

so you can see from this limited sample size, that signs of (even if temporary) top would be greatly increased volume, possibly a failed re-test of the high, and huge intraday volatility

TLDR: i don't think tesla is going to 1,000, for me unleash my gayness i'm going to wait for a big day over day price jump (over 1,000 if preparing today, this might become 2,000 if tesla climbs up to 1,600, etc.), if I'm wrong and the top is in, no harm, if i'm right and stars line up i would make enough to buy a tesla y which i promise to post here after getting GAY8345 license plate

Maybe for aircraft but with batteries where they are now I don't think it makes sense for cars. I built a hydrogen fuel cell powered UAV almost 10 years ago now so I fully expect it to take off in that space eventually.

For cars you don't care about the weight as much as long as you can get the density high enough for 1000km on a charge you don't care a whole lot about hydrogens other strengths.

The real problem with hydrogen is the pipeline vs battery EVs. You still need to collect and/or generate hydrogen. Store and transport it (a bitch btw) and then distribute it (keeps gas stations in business I guess?). This is likely to be massively less efficient then just transmitting electricity and using batteries.

For planes though it's a no brainer. Hydrogen has insane potential for aircraft because of it's energy density. If there is ever electric airliners my bet is the first ones will be hydrogen until we invent insane batteries one day.

EDIT: Fuel cells also have applications outside of vehicles too. They can be very useful as an alternative to traditional natural gas plants for smaller static installations etc. Check out Bloom Energy (BE) and others for this sort of usecase.

It was crazy. And super rare for such a dramatic drop on a non-penny stock. That sucks, dude. You could try to maybe do a roll or something, there could be a decent increase in price in response. At least you limited some of the downside... naked puts would have really really been painful. Maybe do the math on rolling if you want to try to salvage the position? Your long leg could help on that front and you haven’t been assigned yet, right? I’d imagine this could be a big assignment risk and that would lock in the losses.

So, when you make "enough" profit for your time, cash out. But this isn't the kind of company that ER should move your decision to sell/hold. Even Disney is the same. Their quarterly reports are a good insight, but they're too much dinosaur-long to use the report to judge buy/sell

Yeah pretty much this. Also some brokerages get extremely asspissed if you buy OTC shares and charge fees up the wazoo.

Looks like we’re getting a bunch of stimi money, poor people buy IPhones whenever they get handouts. With dems in control minimum wage is going to $15 nationally, once again poor people will have money to buy more iPhones.

Not at all when you’re looking at ratio  between SPAC Ownership vs PIPE ownership. The SPAC to PIPE ratio is very favorable for OAC. The majority of the shares are still being held by current HIMS shareholders, which means they think there is more upside and less reluctant to cash out a greater % of their shares

Whatched Chamath last night talking about how he sold his SPCE position just to be liquid for this year with plans to inject billions into his projects.

I think like this year the market is going to seperate farther then the economy it represents.

Like how many more unemployed got posted and the S&P rallied , I think the party is got another 3 maybe 6 months.

2. Content is designed for smart phones & ROKU can only be streamed on shitty TV sets 

3. It will be incorporated into the ROKU channel I don’t know of any one who watches the ROKU channel 

4. If that’s their entry into the content wars good luck going after all the giant media conglomerates. 

5. Did I mention it Quibi’s business model failed in an epic proportion? 

As per ROKU, increasingly people watch content on their phones, laptops, tablets etc. Also do have to give them credit for adding the ROKU app on shitty TV’s Vizzio and all of those.  However that’s no longer the case as other streamers have out budded them.

Saleforce is mediocre. Business people automatically assume that if its cloud saas that its light, easy, and affordable.

For small business with very basic features of a CRM need its OK. For large organizations that require integration and various features its not intuitive or cost effective. 

Ive also not been impressed with Salesforce sales teams account managers or support. Their licensing while simple on paper is another issue along woth their non transparent pricing (forget what you see online).
its ok, i could only afford 6 LMAO. this is my first ever stock purchase tho
It's going to be funny when people want to sell shares and there's no buyers. People always assume you can just "sell" whenever you want.

You may not be in the right place for those particular questions. Don’t get me wrong, they’re great questions. People will largely be hesitant to discuss it here because they will likely get flamed by other members of the sub. This particular sub is generally concerned with very high risk trades made primarily via options (sometimes with shares in conjunction), which can sometimes yield extremely high profits but are extremely easy to mismanage and very volatile in nature. It’s essentially a Wall Street casino without attractive servers bringing you drinks while you lose money. But the memes are good. 

If you’re seriously interested in learning to invest, check out r/investing for better guidance. While there are investors who are here, this isn’t where they discuss serious investment strategies. This is for trading. Trading and investing are not the same.

No. Even if it drops 50% it'd be the same as a couple weeks ago when several ARKG holdings went down 50%- you get a nice buying opportunity followed by things roaring back up.

We were ahead of the curb again boys. WSB banned the mango man long before Twitter 🥭
Look for the previous lows across 1 month, and 3 months, usually you can tell using hollow candles where the buying resumes pretty easily. Let the stock recover to a previous top wick from a few days prior, if the price itself hits above that previous tick, that’s where you watch for breakouts, the stock will usually test another resistance point pretty quick after exceeding a previously touched top wick from a few days-weeks prior
Nah
Gap up 30 pre market and the moon to 1000 next week. Then 1300-1400 before 10% correction.

Bought more Enphase and ATI (planning to sell all around $23 for over %150 gain). 

Holding off on QS before going back in. Hold all Vax stocks for while longer. 

Might sell AMD (Up 15%) soon- not sure yet.
Not sure what to do with Nikola (up 3%) and NIO (up 23%) yet.

Looking for next YOLO.

I was thinking along the same lines about how big a bubble the S&P already was and they just added the mother of all bubbles to it. It can take forever to crash however, some bubbles take ages to pop.

And that's why I only invest in anywhere from $25-500 investments, typically either $100 or 250 at a time, other than Tesla and apple where I have about 4000 between those two. Ik that idk shit about the market and I'd rather have a bunch of small winners than the possibility of losing everything bc I'm a retard
Cars like that aren't worth it until you have millions. Maintenance cost will drown you. Just rent one when you want to have some fun.
Teacher but I'm tutoring while job hunting.
What if the real play behind the scenes was to bring TSLA into the S&P500 knowing it will go parabolic then crash, bringing the entire market down with it. That way they can blame Tesla and not the actual problems in the world

Trevor is gone, they have a billion dollars in cash on hand, actual working prototypes now that don’t just roll downhill, deliveries scheduled for end of year and a factory that will be finished in 2023. As much as you may hate it, they aren’t going anywhere. Short it at your own risk. The price was beat down almost to nav and it’s now starting to come back up. The bottom has already been reached.

Has the beta of ARKG ever been higher than TSLA?
I personally don't try to predict which way the market moves. I find stocks that have high IV and sell puts or calls at random. I suppose I tend to sell more puts than calls - perhaps because it is a bull market so I figure stocks will typically go up, but I sell calls as well.

But this was just so stupid. On this stock there was a binary event where they happened to release some bad pharmaceutical data a few hours after I sold the puts. The worst part is I actually spent time googling "is there a binary event for this stock", because I don't like to sell options around binary events, but found nothing in the news, yet it still happened.

I'm not talking about the makeup of the current political situation in the US.  I'm talking about the failure of you to recognize that Donald Trump caused and supported the illegal siege of the capitol.

At this point just assume these retards will fall for anything
Do you think it's better to buy protective puts or sell covered calls? And why?

I'm thinking the puts are better for options and covered calls are better for stocks because you don't mind being called away for a stock, but you don't want to buy to close ATM/ITM CCs since that will cost money.
Gimme that fukkin truck. And one for my brother.
The original sample is "whores" but I also say hoes because it flows better.

I will say, I do not understand how they will manage 3 different battery size options (70kwh 100kwh and 150kwh) using the battery swap locations. I guess they will have at least 1 of each battery size at each location? Seems difficult to manage auto swapping batteries with multiple battery size options.

Although op is a tard, Hydrogen is not in competition with pure electric. It is in competition with fossil fuels. So it just has to beat Oil and Coal on price. You have to realize that the energy industry is absolutely gargantuan, and making batteries at break neck speed will still take decades to replace the entire market. There is room for both technologies for the foreseeable future. It would be like saying wood is cheaper than bricks, so houses will only be made of wood. Well the construction industry and massive and both materials are cheaper than steel, and bricks have some benefits over wood, and vice versa.

It did last year by 11%, but this year is obviously different. If not, than it just means Sherman’s one step closer to the exit doors. Note, build a bear went up 23% last year after presenting at the ICR conference. If GME has “unexpected” good news to share, it could make the stock run.

Edit: correction build a bear went up more than 40% after the conference.

Oh, I'm not complaining and yes, still better than working for someone else! Just saying that someone that expects to work less as self-employed might be disappointed.
It's real, coming to a market near you "early 2021". 

First prototype in June 21, estimated income 1bn by 2030.
I've never had that much money so I'm not sure of any specific broker that's better for that much money.  I do know that if you have multiple accounts in a Vanguard, Fidelity, etc you would be good.  Each account itself is usually SIPC protected up to around $500000, so with your amount you could transfer your shares to Fidelity, for example, and split up those shares among an IRA, Roth, Individual account, joint account, etc.  So you would still have all your same shares but fully SIPC protected. 

Never know what will happen with account security, companies crashing, banks closing, etc.  Better to be safe since you're a millionaire.  I hope to be one too someday.

Edit: please anyone correct me or help rockdog out, don't wanna be giving someone bad advice

I was looking for this kind of reaction, it felt like the past months very little was said about Nvidia, while it was hot in August. I agree with your thesis: I doubt they would’ve made the move if there wasn’t a 100% done deal and tbh most of tech is overbought, but you’re probably still right.
Its a clear case of selective enforcement, you got professors posting step-by-steps on destroying the Washington monument while prominent conservatives are banned for ticky tacky nonsense.

There are literally zero fund managers that are worth billions that somehow find themselves plotting on how to “prove a point” to some degenerate gambler who made a few thousand on TSLA. “Proving a point” implies a conscious effort to impact someone else to convince them of the truth of a point asserted.

I cited 2 years ago but 2010-13 GM recalls is the discussion start?

Anyway, I already know Tesla lovers are delusional so I won't beat a dead horse. Like I said, I generally think GM makes pretty shitty vehicles so I'm not defending their quality at all. I own a 2016 GM. The value/lifecycle engineering is amazing actually...shit starts breaking as soon as the warranty expires. It also had a seat belt recall and had to go back to the dealership for an oil pan leak. That being said, until Tesla figures out how to build cars that meet base level (general) consumer expectations I'll be buying elsewhere. Aside from the many issues, their products just dont intrigue me. 

Share holders and bullish brothers: Ride your bubble but carefully plan your exit. Once the novelty wears off share price will normalize quickly.
Hi /u/ComputerTE1996 do you tend to get in on SPACs after there are rumour talks or before Letter of Intent or after Letter of Intent to potentially merge (but before merger announcement) - after good DD.

* Already knew about upgrading their autonomous driving.
* Already knew about how the sedan will look with the preview.

They would've needed new tech to do these things so things as well so it's hard to say priced in. There will be a good run for around 2 weeks if it's like the last NIO day.

Do you understand how insanely expensive our processes are for producing Hydrogen? Sure its energy density and weight make it great for certain applications e.g. disposable rockets. For cars it's almost a non starter due to distribution issues. Hydrogen will eat the gas tanks and need to be replaced every few years. In situ production requires a lot of capital.

Lithium batteries for cars isn't great either but there are a lot less hurdles and the electric networks are already built out - a charger parking lot is a lot less expensive than Hydrogen production facility.

Hydrogen might be great for aircraft in the future but again, the hurdles to get there are very high with our tech.
so you think you'll live forever?

That's right. Tesla's stock price can increase infinitely, thereby creating infinite amounts of wealth for its shareholders who can buy infinite numbers of Tesla's, which further infinitely increases Tesla's stock price. What could go wrong?

That is why you do a hedge. Long put on Tesla and calls on Nio.  This going to be my play anyways.
Throw 1M into a dividend fund like JEPI, you get 1% cash dividend a month. That's 120K a year on top of the 11-15% YOY growth on your principal, pretty comfortable life. That's generational wealth dude, you're past the point of a nice little nest egg
If I had 5 grand I would yolo into TSLA.
Time to hop in spacex pre IPO
No sir but wish.  I was in at $7 back in December and watched it moon to like $17 then crash back to $8 then slow climb up then crash back to $9 and I was buying the dip.  Wednesday when it went to about $18 I sold the 250 shares I had then not wanting to get caught in the same cycle.

As is the effect that I seem to have (I know I don't have any influence on the markets but damn if it doesn't seem like it) it continues to climb another $10.  Dammit, why now.  No news and Riot and BTBT were mooning, MARA just went sideways...then woke up a week later.  No idea and even if I did hold I think I'd be taking my profits.  It will be at $18 end of next week I bet.  If I buy it will probably drop to $10 if I don't it will go to $30.  True story
He’s the perfect balance of true autist and wsb autist.

Once you’re old like me, working on weekends doesn’t matter. I thought that would be comforting, but actually is probably even more depressing as it underscores just how fleeting your youth is (when you’re old, there’s no difference between a Saturday and a Tuesday except the market being closed).

I don't think I can't take much more of this wage slavery.  Every non necessary purchase I make, every dollar I spend.

Pretty sure I should just live in a box and take the bus to work if it means I can retire sooner.

\- New battery station 2.0 can service more vehicles faster

\- New computing system powered by NVIDIA is 7 times more powerful than Tesla's? Did i hear that right?

\- LiDAR sensor takes the safety of autonomous driving two levels higher

\- Price is under 60k with BaaS?

Yo, you should sell JUST to move it to a brokerage that supports that much money.  That money can be lost because it's above the amount they insure on every account, remember that if it's just up and gone they won't help you but other brokers will.  Keep on holding though for sure, you can probably get a transfer actually instead of selling also!

Also this exact same thing happened in 1999-2000.

There were shit tons of “investment email” services that popped up over night. This isn’t a new phenomenon.

You need to diversify your bonds, nigga.
when it was 680, it was nowhere as overbought on the daily RSI. A stock can always keep going up (look at how bullish the channel square has been trading in all year), but every stock will have pullbacks and consolidation periods. Tesla has not reached these overbought levels since August 31 (not even during their s&p inclusion run-up). Trust me, as someone who understands the stock’s behaviour well, a pullback is imminent. The only thing driving is it retail fomo (no news) and i expect them to at least fill the $820 gap, more likely down to 730, before making the next push higher!

Long-term bullish, short-term bearish right now.
This makes me sad

Investors DO prove points to other investors. Have you not read a fucking a book? Shut the fuck up now

I’ve heard the term “retail investors” for years. Just because the larger public now has a greater awareness doesn’t impact institutions or those who run them. There’s no “we have to prove a point” going on. That’s absurd. The ones directly benefiting from retail investors are the brokerages. Robin Hood has profited insanely by unethically front running their customers’ orders and screwing them out of their full potential profit (or magnifying their losses). That’s not some big institutional firm. The ways that retail investors have had impacts on big firms is primarily through the options market, and only on a few securities. Will their computer algorithms adjust to increased volume and volatility? Of course. They’re programmed to do exactly that. It’s not because they’re trying to “prove a point.” It’s because the computers will absolutely capitalize on increased volatility opportunities and they are far better at it than some idiot sitting on a toilet with their smart phone. But the biggest impact even to the options market wasn’t from retail traders, it was from large institutions like SoftBank buying up $4 billion in calls on big tech last summer, massively spiking volume, volatility, and option price. That resulted in major market makers, who have to aim to be beta neutral, having to respond with purchasing massive amounts of shares of those stocks, spiking the prices continually upwards. This same trend has been continuing, by the way.

Aight I mean you do you. But consider it like this. Let’s say you have a 3M NW. you decide to stick 2/3 of it in TSLA, which is up 800% in 1 year. Seems like a bad idea, right? that’s just what you’re doing taking the emotional holding we part out of it. 

Can’t really be sad by taking 1mil out after taxes.

It’s only profit when you sell
then that’s on me for not being engaging

Bro.. it’s an old running joke here. 1. The markets aren’t open and 2. East Germany doesn’t exist anymore.
Trading 212 is better and cheaper.
Hmm  is quite a repudiation of CLOV as a true growth company. 

Like he and you say it is pivoting from Medicare Advantage as it has struggled to grow outside its core markets. MA is a economies of scale business so its hard for them to compete vs. UNH and other established payers in their new markets. And the 3 star rating is bad. So its AI is not working or not being followed or not engaging members well so in the end its not working to improve outcomes. 

Thanks for this. I might quietly sell my shares and calls next week and buy NIO leaps or something.

Not much from what I understand. There’s a metric they use called “bounce rate” to account for people like us. They can see us enter and then leave almost immediately. We don’t add much value.
I’ve been making noise about how shitty some of these expensive EV companies are and understandably have been dicked on a bit...but BLNK is really the worst of the worst and makes FCEL, PLUG, etc. look like BRK. If you are going long BLNK for the long term you deserve to lose money.

Let's be honest that adpbe art is what makes the valuation. Tesla had to do magic with numbers for 10 years.

Steel Daddy! I've been meaning to ask you. Robinhood announced that they're changing "certain types of securities on Robinhood". 

Link: [https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-securities-robinhood-2021/](https://robinhood.com/us/en/support/articles/changes-securities-robinhood-2021/)

MT is included in this announcement in the New York registry shares. If I'm reading this right, does this mean autists are no longer able to buy calls on MT??? 

I've literally been injecting my paychecks into these calls. Plz don't tell me I can't keep doing that.

So true. We’re all Burry on this one, and while I initially enjoyed seeing NKLA tank after T Milton was caught out, I had to take it off my watch list. It hurt seeing how far HYLN had fallen, and how other other amazing stocks had yet to take off, while NKLA remained steady and sometimes trending to the upside. Who are these idiot NKLA bulls?
I expect some massive gains and selloffs throughout the day. I would say around $80.
$72???? How? ✌🏿🔥🔥🔥🔥
Can’t be giving away the secrets man!

Good, he won’t mind then.

You can sell a call against every 100 shares you own and keep the full premium if the stock remains below the strike price at expiration.

TSLA has inflated premiums particularly in extremely out of the money calls. Against his 2,180 shares he can write 21 1/15 1200c at $2.16 for a total of $4,536 as long as TSLA doesn’t gain more than 35% in the next week. And if it did that he’d either buy back the calls and sell a different contract or let them exercise and he sells his shares at $1200.

The premiums won’t be this good when the stock isn’t running but still awesome.
How much did you have to fork out up front got this?

banks make money by investing, if theyre holding tesla stocks theyre not going to publish something telling their readers to sell tesla or not buy tesla.  if they're not holding tesla stocks and tesla is undervalued by their analysis, theyre going to keep their mouth shut and buy the stocks up and then tell people to buy in.

There’s a huge range of income potential in both fields. Ultimately they are still vocations. Highly paid vocations but vocations nonetheless. Once you get to the point of scaling a business the marginal value you get out of a JD or MD degree is very minimal
Oh yeah. The worst part is when you do their job for them and they still have the audacity to say what you're doing isn't good enough. Oh well - I like to think that our generation won't be so resistant to change when the time comes given how much change is constantly happening around us now. They entered the workforce during a time of stagnation and "this is how it is", we entered with a "keep up or die" atmosphere and I think the future will be brighter because of it.

Full TSLA retard here. What short memory you have, wasn't it just 2ish years ago Tesla was recalling cars for sporadic battery fires not caused by a collision?

How many models does GM make? TSLA? How many vehicles does GM sell? TSLA? Percentage wise GM has a lot less recalls.

Tesla also ranks last on initial quality. 250 problems per 100 vehicles sold. No person I know that bought a Tesla didn't have to take it back. One person I know literally had their roof panel delaminate and peel off like a sardine can on the highway, as I alluded to.

GM makes pretty shitty vehicles overall, but Tesla's faux luxury status is hilariously ignored by their bulls and the market. That's fine, I don't really care. But facts is facts.

Can anyone decipher that Elon musk tweet. Pretty cheeky that he had to mention his son was 14 🤔
Or short.
Okay, maybe I downplayed his technical contributions. I’ll be open to changing my mind on some of that. 

My comment about women was not he abuses them- it was that he’s no playboy, in response to the original comment. So idk what your point is. Read his rolling stone interview- he’s a total dork with women.

Yea fr tho that gives you the desire to fuck her even harder and reclaim her. However i think a marriage where this is a frequent happening is doomed to fail due to an imbalance in the power dynamics between you and your wife. Id say get over the fact other men are better endowed and make yourself valuable in other ways to women sexually, mentally and financially

> There's gotta be a number tsla could drop to and it would be better owning the shares at less value then selling and paying the taxes on them though, right?

There's no circumstance where tesla drops in value such that the taxes he owes makes it so he ends up with more money by holding onto a dropping stock.  That doesnt work for anything.  It always better to have more before taxes and to pay more in taxes, because ur always only paying a % of the additional money.  Taxes are a % not a flat fee.

You will definitely lose brain cells.
yes i know this and have said as much in my post history. 

But when "retail" (esp. wsb) starts getting talked about way too much in the mainstream people do things, especially investors, to prove a point - which is what i am suggesting in my post. 

Up until recently you never heard of "retail investors" outside of the financial sector. Now you have every youtuber and tiktoker hawking stocks like bazooka gum. 

So while i say the same things you have said, the proliferation of social media has made the impact of retail a little more than before.

Are you dumb? Porsche is a huge company. Besides that, they're owned by volkswagen. Porsche is not in the business of building cheap cars to devalue their brand. They know their niche, and they stick to it and are the absolute leader in that space. The mass market cheap cars is what other brands are for who are also under the volkswagen umbrella. Volkswagen has a brand for every market segment.

No man, think of it another way, the more retail investors that flood the market, the better. Until regulations kick in because dumb asses don't make the slightest effort to learn anything, then cry like a wittle baby when they lose all their money, I think it will have a substantial impact.
Nope

And the spread between bid/ask, which is important (if a contract was selling for 2.00, I could put in a bid for 10,000 contracts at 1.25, but that probably will never get filled. But it will still count as "open interest," but create a big spread between the bid/ask. Volume is important because they're completed transactions; it's easy to get excited about a huge number when it relates to interest, but that's not indicative of anything happening and can be used as a manipulative tool).

You realize that the big institutions don’t give a fuck about retail investors and aren’t trying to strategize on how to ruin them, right? You’re an ant to them. Their algorithms are making the trades and the only objective is to maximize gain while hedging against losses. When a correction occurs their algorithms switch their focus. There is no grand conspiracy against retail investors, they’re just retarded and it’s easier for them to believe in some sort of conspiracy against them rather than face their own ignorance and stupidity. This is true in other areas in life because it’s the way humans operate (see, for example, the current U.S. political situation). Computers, the actual things making the trades for the institutions, don’t have that issue.

I’m glad you asked. It’s merging with HIMS. Here is their investors presentation: https://res.cloudinary.com/forhims/image/upload/v1601546466/documents/investors/HH-Investor_Presentation.pdf

One thing to keep note of is that the PIPE investment is only $75million, which is the smallest I’ve seen in a while. What this means is that there will be less of a sell off once the merger is complete and the pipe lock up period expires. For comparison, CLOV’s pipe investment is $400m, HYLN has a $325m PIPE and had a major sell off from $60 to $15 after lock up. Got to remember that PIPE investors got in at $10 and are going to want to take profit.

RobinHood is the app of choice around here. It's incredibly easy to use. So much so that novices can use it - and they do. 


I have TD Ameritrade for my serious investments and RobinHood for my "fun" account. There's lots of videos on YouTube on puts vs. calls and basic options trading. Even the first time you trade on RobinHood they offer explanatory prompts and little tutorials. 


My advice is start small until you get the hang of it.

With Chinas growing middle class this car is not nearly as expensive as it may seem. Still cheaper than the model S with far more in luxury and utility. I don’t think people are properly understanding the importance of this in the Chinese market. Most of the growing middle to upper class are newly rich Chinese who place a lot of emphasis on luxury, and while I bet Tesla will always be the leader in autopilot tech, the inside of a Tesla has pretty much nothing
Open interest is the amount of contracts out there and volume is the amount of trades
Can someone fill me in a lil til I have time to check out whatever news is out on Nio?

Well there are ETF's that try to track how volatility is.

Some of those are UVXY, And SPXS..

They spike up when things get too volatile and you have a chance to make really good profit on the spike up and then you can even buy puts after a spike as they decay back down pretty fast which is why you see they are at the levels they are at..
I’m down
Yeah PLTR grew so fast it priced in years of growth. Most people aren’t getting that. It could be stuck in this channel for quite some time. Glad you made it all back.

Yea that's CME's future contract for West Texas Intermediate crude, you can go to to their website for the full contract spec. Dunno whether the bots go nuts if I posted the direct link here. As a note, be aware that the date  you'll see for the contract on most platforms is for the delivery date. So a March contract stops trading mid Feb. Can be a bit confusing. IBKR at least on their options on the future use the last trading date for the underlying future for their options naming scheme.
And thus begins the end of r/wallstreetbets.   Do mods have a backup plan?

 I joined this subreddit early 2018 shortly after I started investing and was searching for advice. Thanks to you autists, this mofo got me on the fast track to options. I nuked my account in the first year of trading by -50%. It. Was. Great. Such a rush. And thank baby Jesus for the March crash because that's when everything turned around. Since then I have rode calls into Valhalla and my account has doubled, even weeds stocks which comprised of 90% of my portfolio in 2018/2019 have been revived (haven't sold, still holding until the shit is green in my state).

But there comes a time in a man's life when he must make a decision. I remember in 2018 it wasn't so bad and gay to be a bear...it was just part of the cycle it seemed. I think the year of the bear is upon us. Michael Burry, from the big short, who got in too early to the shortage of the housing market was eventually right. Granted, he entered the short too soon and he could have saved \~20% by timing it better. I figure he's learned from this and got his timing down much better over the decade. He is short TSLA, he didn't say it when we hit $420 , $1000, post 5:1 split $690...he's chosen to do it now, and since then it has risen nearly +30% more since he first said he is short TSLA. When TSLA falls, I think it is what starts the 'correction' mode on SPY and the rest of the market.

I think the new prez and related c0ngress are worried coming into a market that is at all time highs, for fear that it'll most likely have to crash during their term in power and people might want to blame them. I think they try to crash it with the changing of the guards when J-Pow is replaced with J-Yellen; they'll try to crash it 1st few weeks in office saying that 'it was like this before we got here, blame the orange man' rather than giving it a year or few months into their term.

Conspiracy numbers to do math with:  
(a) Burry Housing Short gain = **489%**  
(b) Since Burry started shorting TSLA = **up by 30%**  
(c) $420.69 reversed = **$960.24**  
(d) Year of the last time the capitol was breached = **1814**  
(e) Papa Elon's Net Worth = **$195B**  
(f) TSLA market cap = **$834B**  
(g) Year Elon became CEO of TSLA & the year Burry's short paid off = **2008**

\*Positions pending\* eyeing $420 puts to March

TL;DR  
Burry is off with the TSLA short as was his housing short. $960.24 is the TSLA top.
This is the state of the market. These are the same rabid tards that sent a penny stock to the moon because Elon tweeted about an unrelated company

Let me say they she didn't leave my side after turning her down. Got a lap dance before I left.

True. I totally get it. But this airline has a bad reputation as it is. The plane is pretty old. Indonesia in general doesn’t have the greatest track record with airplane crashes so maybe boeing could use that to their defense, but I agree, monday is prob gonna be brutal for Boeing.

Exactly. Tesla has solved driving down a highway. Great job! That is very easy, hence even a company as illiterate in software engineering as Tesla could do that.

BMW had a similar feature ten years ago.

Hats off to the marketing to pushing this front and centre, but this is nothing new.


Now how does that help with robo cabs?

It doesn't! Because the trips they mostly would do are from random start to destination within same metropolitan area, and not from the center of one metropolitan to another.

So yes. Well done Tesla: you solves the wrong problem, one that every one else also solved.

Well lithium is being ramped up everywhere, and new  recycling technologies are being works on as well. Check out Neometals in Australia, they are working on a test plant now, and plan to scale up the following year.

There are also many storage technologies being worked on outside of lithium batteries for utilities type energy storage. Things like mechanical storage. Excess solar energy pumps water up towers during the day, and uses gravity at night. Or like giant blocks getting lifted...etc. also as you said hydrogen, through electrolysis is a big area of research. Some new materials are being worked on to help with the rapid decay problems the electrodes have.

The future of clean energy and storage is going to be a large mix of solutions, imo.

Nice work Elon. What should I invest in oh wise one?
yes, nuclear is the cheapest form to produce but no one knows how to deal with the waste. So it's really hard to get communities to buy into nuclear.  Also SMR are 15 years away from being commericalized.

 I own CCJ for a bet on Small Modular Reactors, but the EU is pushing for hydrogen not nuclear.  China seems to favor nuclear because of their advanced SMR, so uranium prices will go higher.

But the US/Europe will go hydrogen.  China/Japan will likely be nuclear.  South Korea will be hydrogen.

I'm long NIO and LI simply as long term investments (I'm far from all in but sunk like 5k into NIO six months ago and a couple thousand into LI this week) . To me, they're like what Hyundai was in the 1980s.
When is the best time to roll? Closer to expiration date or as soon as it is ITM?
It’s a good stock for a boomer portfolio.

Good deal 😎 In case you hadn’t seen the Nio x Nvidia announcement, they may be worth watching too. Best of luck sir!
If you lost that 5K would you be devastated? If so, just throw it into some VTI. Don’t chase YOLO’s just to have crippling depression later on. Maybe play with 5%?

“Fear of missing out” so you yolo in. FOTM too “flavor of the month” for hot shit that’s pumping.
Agree once 99% realize they’re not actually being censored and no one cares that they’re a conservative with opinions, they’ll just stay on twitter and freely complain about free speech freely. Change and action are hard, and it’s easier to just talk without doing.

Everything else about twitter is true, they’ll probably drop. A bubble burst would probably collapse them. Who the fuck would hold Twitter? Not a bad idea overall.

Nasdaq is a mere 35% higher than it's previous high of Feb 2020 and people in /r/investing think it's the next 1999. 

I swear most people instantly jump to 1999 when looking at bubbles without taking into account the context. 

1999 most tech companies had a dozen employers, a .com address and an office... Now we have hundreds of tech companies that are fundamentally engrained in every aspect of our lives and business to the point where we literally couldn't function properly even 1 day without them.

In my opinion the Nasdaq is simply a reflection of the sheer importance of tech in a world that is basically driven by tech.

EVs don’t exist where I live. If congress pushes bs green crap, you don’t think big manufacturers have the upper edge with brand recognition? Seriously Tesla=silicon valley= liberal elite in many communities even mid sized cities.
So what do you think is he answer here? Is the hope that this company gets an insane amount of contracts under Biden and pays off that debt? Or is that the stock turns into a meme like Enphase and pays off the debt that way? Wouldn’t that force them to dilute the shares to pay off debt? I like this company but this bear is pretty convincing.

Yes, SVFAU are the units, commons and warrants will be listed in 50 days or so. Units are kind of expensive right now, but i’m just going to slowly keep buying them over the next few months to average down. I’m expecting a pretty quick deal compared to other SPACs. Hopefully around May for a target.
Haha it’s a ba plane but if u look into Indonesia’s history with plane crashes and why it makes u reconsider the outlook. That airline was banned from 2001 til 2017 in the eu for safety issues.

Your confusing revenue and valuation. Obviously the connection is very tenuous between those two things. 

Look at toyota. Been making about 60B a quarter for about the last eon. Yet their valuation has been climbing steadily. If valuation was a function of revenue, toyota would be flat. Or maybe grow at exactly the rate of inflation. But nope.

My question is: Is options trading cross platform? Like if I sell, can only someone from Robin Hood purchase them or can people from other brokerages buy them as well? I wasn't planning on loading anymore, and if the price is still going to go up, all I need to know is if I am fucked or will I need to transfer brokerages.
Show us your account then.
Calls i imagine
Lol, I know it seems far fetched, but it’s me thinking out loud and adding another topic for consideration.

OP is gonna need TSLA to have another monster week, going up 10 percent week just to get to breakeven. Theta is gonna wreck those gains pretty damn quick if TSLA starts to lose steam 

To be fair there was some dude asking how he should put his last 300 in TSLA after JPM gave the price upgrade earlier in the week. I told him spreads would be his best bet but also told him that he more than likely missed the boat. Oops

I’m in same boat. Not quite as much as you, but up there. Half of my shares are 2000% I, shoulda bought more! One thing I did on Thursday was sell 1 covered call. Now I’m freaking out and I feel like I need to eat the extra premium and buy it back. I don’t want to sell either. It doesn’t matter to me what it’s worth any more, I’m just going to try and pretend it doesn’t exist.
Yeah, its a great car. I owe a KIA proceed which in its price range is IMO one of the best looking cars and i cant say a bad word about KIA itself. 

Build quality, steering, handling - very European. 

Service amazing. Not expensive to service even after warranty. 

What KIA did in the last years is truly amazing. I shaped from a BMW and... I honestly like KIA equally if not more in some aspects.
Or sell OTM covered weekly calls and roll them when they go into the money. So with Tesla roll every day lol
If I could put my 401k into ARKK, I would.

I am studying in the energy field and tbh, I don't feel it is true at all.

Do you know what is the cheapest energy in the world?

\- Nuclear energy, imagine if we can have a small nuclear reactor inside every car. But it is impossible due to how dangerous it is. Lithium-ion is temporary. Technology will invent and improve it. Hydrogen cells will be ok in the future, but nothing more...

This is my opinion, go if you want to waste your money...
Who else thinks that “hip hop” culture is ruining kids minds these days
Serious question and not trying to start shit. If Trump does decide to get into options trading would he even be able to? I've read very little on the subject but I remember a couple lines from Rich Dad Poor Dad and some Buffet talks about the Uber rich having to invest differently. Just like how we are banned from discussing certain tickers. 

The buffet line was, "I know quite a few people who can turn 100k to 200k but I don't know hardly anyone who can turn 1 mil into 2 mil."

Something to that effect.

Fuck off, this isn't r/investing
It's not an actual Earnings Report, they're just previewing holiday sales numbers.  Looks like something they do every year in mid-January. Q4 Earnings are likely toward the end of March. 

Uberkikz's model has them underperforming on holiday sales due to a few factors, but a big one is they didn't have a full supply of next gen consoles because manufacturing was hindered by covid. Since everyone is using the console cycle as a catalyst (second to RC obviously), if it comes out that sales are in any way lackluster or even just slightly above average, I'm worried people will lose enthusiasm and shorts will have an opening to trigger a sell off. Regardless, none of the underlying factors will change so at worst we'll have another dip to buy.

(FWIW DOMO capital responded on Twitter that they disagree with his analysis and their model shows holiday sales numbers will be strong)

yes lmao no need for primary schooling here.

> Tesla has a 129.12 fucking PE ratio. 

you need to double check your numbers man. it's 1743.58 not 129. forward PE is 190.

also why you so worried about this. certainly not because of missing out?

just remember people have been saying that for ages. I wouldn't short it now, but you can try if you want.

bubbles don't pop because you say so. bubbles pop because support doesn't hold anymore. rn it's holding tight as fuck. and with current growth. PE will be cut to 1/8 wit the same prices by next year.

I work in the clothing industry and we used to work with champion for a few years. Unfortunately there is no way for Champion to ever become like Nike. They won’t even be able to reach Adidas or even Puma level. 

Adidas can’t even touch Nike right now. The only time Adidas had a chance was in 2016 when they had the NMDs and Nike just took it over with Virgil Abloh the 10s.

The design and marketing team are not even on par at Champion. They probably had more market share a few years ago when Vetements and Supreme did those collaborations with them but every brand has pretty much stayed away from them except Rick Ownes this last season and all that shit went on sale. 

Lack of innovation, same shit every season, Hanes is a staple brand, can’t rely on champion. They also don’t make sneakers and the ones they do are completely garbage.

>It will buy and sell as required to maintain the balance

Changes in the value of the shares they already have will automatically maintain the balance. Maybe I don't know how to word this correctly, but I'll try again:

Its market cap is 659 billion which is 1.6%, so the total market cap of S&P500 is 41.187 trillion. If Telsa's market cap drops in half, that means that the value of shares the index already had also drops in half. Now Tesla's market cap is 330 billion out of 40.858 trillion, so it's 0.8% of the S&P. The shares the index had lost half their value, bringing the Tesla share down from 1.6% of the index to 0.8% of the index. They didn't sell any shares in this scenario.

Edit: Obviously, if Tesla is completely removed from the S&P500, that's a different story and they have to sell all the shares.

The growth of the tontine warrant structure isn’t based on the number of people who sell after the LOI is announced. It is based on the number of people who don’t like the merger target and opt to redeem their shares for NAV ($20) and forgo tontine warrant. I originally thought the same as your point above, but after I re-read the s1 it’s actually based on the number of holders who opt to redeem for NAV which won’t be very many given it’s trading at 30% premium

Waymo has the city mapped into its car to a much higher degree than normal GPS and they need to do this for all streets in the world if they are to scale up.

Tesla does self driving based on regular GPS and its onboard sensors. It doesn't need anything extra info other than what is already avaliable.

Waymo may beat Tesla in a "fenced" city, but cannot leave that area. Tesla's can do self driving anywhere. They have much more room to grow.

So yes the basic physics do change. They do not operate on the same principal.

Why would you get a loan for 25% of your TSLA value instead of just selling 25% of your TSLA? You realize TSLA has never paid a dividend, and has no plans to anytime soon. That means the only way you get money out of your shares is by selling them. Or writing covered calls against them I guess, which wouldn’t be a bad move at all.
According to market cap, every car TSLA sold per year is worth $1.25M. GM is worth $9000 per car.

I don’t care how benign you argue their intent was, their effected goal was sedition and success would’ve been treason. We punish these crimes with a much more stringent standard under the law because they’re much more serious offenses. Again, y’all can sit here and argue that they’re the same, and I guess it’s all violence, but the details are pretty massively different.
I think there's going to be a sell off soon. I'm noticing an increasing number of people saying that now stock price is a bit too high. Plus the big guys can intentionally trigger a sell off and make some money off that.
The cap test is regarding the LKA. It's about how well they can drive in the middle of the road and keep a lane and switch lanes.

On clearly marked highways. 

This will not help you one bit when driving through suburbs and you have to step behind a lane of parked cars and let another car pass. No automated system can do that and won't for the next 20 years.

That is what you and your buddies don't understand: a robo cabs best use is for suburban home to destinations, usually a restaurant, pub, work or shop, somewhere central. The issues are the obstacles and unpredictable road layout.

It's not straight down the highway. The obstacles are range and lane keeping.

I mean if you google it you’ll find dozens of articles from highly respected independent consumer product analysts/journalists/magazines. It’s an incredibly well-known issue. But also worth noting that VERY few Teslas have been sold so far, relative to any other type of car. The vast majority of owners are currently hardcore Elon/Tesla fanboys (overwhelmingly young white “geeky” men, and very rarely women or nonwhites; but that’s a discussion for another time).  Any reasonable person would expect them to overlook obvious defects or quality control issues, because they so desperately want to love the car and believe in the company and it’s CEO. Part breaks and car has to sit in driveway for 5 weeks waiting for a replacement? No biggie, at least I get to drive this super cool futuristic car!! That’s just the price of being an *early adopter* like me. Etc.

Oh. I guess it's in the same spirit as this. Kratom can be very subtle though, and you can just slam a spoonful in the morning and go about your day with some pep in your step and a little euphoria. No one's going to suck peepees for this stuff. I take it in the morning and with my pre-workout. Good stuff.

Don't know why their "good news" in any way justifies the hype, they missed their Q4 delivery targets and literally increase their market cap by a Toyota most weeks nowadays. It's running on nothing but pure speculation right now, anyone getting in at this stage is not buying for the business, they're buying for the higher share price.
GM Cruise is a handful of weeks away from FSD taxis taking public passenger money without a safety driver in the car.  In other words, the L5 taxi dreamworld.

So, there's a couple of things I would like to dispute. Firstly the  person speaking on the panel wasn't the CEO Stanley, it was John Trizzino, CEO is speaking Monday morning at JP Morgans conference, Pre-Market (8:20).

At no point in the chat does he mention a delay, he does state something like "the public guidance we've given is that...." and then said bout SA results end of Jan, and UK results shortly after.

Now, I'm not saying it won't play out like that, but ultimately that's the guidance they've put in PRs for weeks/months now. Stan (CEO) did a TV interview around xmas time and said results would be out in a couple of weeks.

Obviously, with the market closed it's not like there's any play that can be made before Monday, but I don't think the comment Trizzino made is of such significant value as people have taken it.

Plus, that webcast was out far earlier in the day, had that been the cause of the dip, it would have started much earlier. I think MM led to a drop in price so options were avoided, and ultimately people are blaming it on this comment in hindsight.

We will see Monday!

Currently only holding boomer stocks til Biden is inaugurated and will likely continue holding off on anything ludicrous through his first 100 days in office. Chances are, given he now has control of the legislative branch, if he’s going to seriously do anything which will kill major industries and highly regulate certain corporations, it’ll happen within that time frame and I’ll be able to buy into some major dips.
I think the warrants unlock when the new ticker closes at or above $36 for 10 consecutive days.  It's definitely two per nine shares.

I meant no disrespect. I apologize if that sounded condescending. I just didn’t want people to discount your opinion due to a clerical error. 

Let me ask you, since we’re on the subject: why would you consider it a bad thing if a manufacturer used a part that was “overkill” to perform a job? From a customer standpoint, I would take that as a greater value, and as a hotrodder? That shows potential for improvement. 

For example: Honda built a reputation in the 80’s and 90’s as a company overflowing with both performance and reliability. One of the reasons they achieved both those things was to use a forging process in the manufacturing of their crankshafts. The engines were built to sustain a long term power rating of around 140hp to 180hp depending on the model, and yet the crankshafts were rated to withstand over 400hp. In fact, even top tier drag race engine manufacturers (Dart) still call for the use of OEM Honda cranks for their race builds. 

I just fail to see how this can be construed as a negative. I’d like your thoughts on how the same practice could be an “inefficiency” in this instance. 

Let me balance all that with 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌖💎✋

As someone who’s been bullish Tesla longer than most of the new buyers today, I hope it crashes like 30% just to teach you guys a lesson. Actually technically it only needs to not go up 10% for most of you OTM call holders to lose.
Planes are routinely upgraded when bulletins come out from Boeing. FAA rules dictate that it has to happen. I know because I used to work at Boeing.

its killing ppl for sure
I am arguing in good faith, but it is difficult with cultists who take elons word as gospel.

What you clearly don't understand is that Tesla is equally far away from the robo cab as GM is, and even further than Argo or Waymo.

That is the reality!

The sf to la trip does not matter. It's PR and does not get them any closer to putting uber out of business.
Yes GM is a pile of debt and mismanagement, has the worst brand rec there is and even worse designers, but they have cash flow and a currently working product, better than Tesla.

And Argo and Waymo will beat Tesla on the robo cab if it is ever possible to build at all.

The future you and your friends describe does not exist and neither will it ever. Elon will sooner land humans on Mars than get level 5 self driving cars!

You’re only seeing it from GME & PLTR gang. Tesla has way more to rip. Don’t pay attention to those poor idiots that got sucked into buying that trash.
Oh, myne I'm misinformed then. Well, although that could be true I dont think I could justify investing in Tesla at its current level. $880 a share after its stock split is absurd.
This picture has just made me realize that in addition to "Forrest Whittaker eye," there is also "Jeff Bezos eye."
Institutions are going to HAZE you new fucks so bad by violently pulling their money from companies, temporarily, that it will ruin the avg. investor to the point of they will never invest again. 

Its a lesson that the arrogant have to learn every so often. "Why do we (institutions) have to be consistent but you can make our money in one trade" is their thinking. 

LMFAO, cant wait to see the blood bath. Although the real implications are sad because of the avg person who will be ruined and not have anything in life. Catch 22, but those shark institutions DGAF.

Is that bad?
Not everyone has a quarter million dollars that can just pretend doesn't exist and hide it in a stock. If you made that in one year you'd be a complete fool not to sell. 

Tesla doesn't even make $1 billion a year. They are not a $1 trillion company. Would you pay $1 million for a company that profits $1,000 a year? That is the exact math here. 

There are likely 1000s of companies that make way beyond $1 billion (in a quarter not an entire year) and they have nowhere near that kind of valuation. 

GM/Ford combined (just for the last quarter) profited $5 to $6 billion on $70 billion in sales in 3 months. Their combined valuation is $95 billion. 

Tesla squeaked by with $300 million in quarterly profit on $9 billion in sales (likely 125k rich people buying 70k cars). Their valuation is $830 billion. 

$300 million profit (TSLA) vs. $6 billion profit (GM+F).
$9 billion sales (TSLA) vs. $70 billion sales (GM+F).
$1 trillion valuation (TSLA) vs. $90 billion valuation (GM+F).

Something doesn't add up but feel free to go hunt for a company that makes $1,000 profit in a year and offer to buy them out for $1,000,000. That's what is going on with Tesla right now. 

It could be that, "but, but, but, they'll change the world, everyone will worship Tesla and buy one, and but, but, everything will be Tesla, so the valuation makes sense....cause years from now everything will be Tesla". 

Yes, it could be, but right now the reality is you are walking up to a lemonade stand on a hot summer day and offering an 8 year old 1 million dollars to own the lemonade stand. (I know not the best analogy but profits to valuation it is actually quite accurate).
Only softbank can sell shares to you

Im not gonna buy tesla because its volatile.  Just because i know it's going down doesn't mean I think i can make money on it lol.  Gladly, keep holding but this is like every stock bubble in history.  Its gonna pop and lots of people are gonna be sad lol.

The market cap of GME in its current state is still undervalued. Most investors who got in within the last few months are forward looking and expect a transformation. GME has shut out and continues to several locations that are not seen as profitable and/or have too much redundancy based on locations. I for one am not a customer myself but have walked by and viewed several locations in my area (with just over a mil in pop) and surrounding towns and can tell you that there are always people inside the stores. Just recently in a mall on a Monday and there were only 3 stores that had lines outside for people waiting to get in: 1.Lululemon 2.EB games 3. Lululemon (new spot opening).
Long term if GME doesn’t change there revs will continue to fall, but that’s not what I nor most other investors are expecting. The business is changing and if the executive’s don’t pivot the new console releases as part of this change there’s several people waiting to get in and make the necessary changes to make GME a thriving business.

Hijacking top comment because I'm an ass like that. TSLA keeps rising due to supply and demand of shares.

Insiders like Musk own 30% of shares.  Institutions and actively traded ETFs own another 20%. The S&P inclusion took 20-30% of float off the market.

Those groups are basically not going to sell.

Then there is another 10% held by retails in 401k/IRA that bought a long time ago and won't sell until retirement.

So today there is maybe 10% of float being actively traded (just changing hands a lot), and there are a lot of FOMOs who are trying to snatch up the little bit that remains.

Constricting supply always leads to higher prices.

Other car makes don't have that issue, they have plenty of shares being traded and no one is FOMOing in.

Unless, ya know, it’s removed in the index or weighted less in the index. It’s not like spy goes “I’m gonna hold a million Tesla shares no matter what”

It will buy and sell as required to maintain the balance (and it’s not just tesla, it’s sectors). 

> Tesla stock (TSLA) had a market capitalization of $659 billion based on shares available to trade, which translates to about a 1.6% weight in the S&P 500.

So I saw someone’s post on here. Last year couldn’t get a $200k mortgage. Now has $1.8 in Tesla profits. Said he will never sell a single share. People in the comments saying “there will never be a pullback.”

If I had to guess I don’t think this story will end well.
Thank you TSRA

Someone's calls aren't doing well... Lol which considering the obvious political leaning, that's surprising. Lol y'all took 2 back to back blindside wins that no one expected. If you believe in your party half as much as you hate the other, you should be in a much better mood holding some OTMs on green energy, EV, and weed stonks which would be deep ITM if you made those bets end of Oct. Maybe even some 🐻🌈 action on oil companies if you're feeling extra liberal with your cash. (Get it? Liberal with your cash...😂😂)

TL;DR talk stonks or pure ignorance/retardation. We have no room or time for anything else.

No worries. Well “buying back a call” really means you’re just closing the position. When you sell a covered call you’re selling to open a position. In RH you’ll see under the call it shows -1. When you want to buy it back/close the position, you would buy the same call to cancel out the one you’ve already sold. This is called buying to close the position. Once you do this the call will disappear from your RH account because it’s been closed out. 

When someone says the “same call”, they don’t mean the exact call you sold, they just mean the same strike price and date. Which for all intents and purposes is the same call. This then cancels out the one you sold.

On RH it isn’t really super easy to see what’s happening when you’re doing it. But in other platforms  like TOS it is much more clear what’s going on.

There are many reasons to buy that covered call back, especially if you think the shares are going to be called away. But the most common seems to be so you have that immediate buying power.

So tired of only seeing Tesla in this sub since months. Gonna celebrate when the bubble finally pops.
It’s fake, he fucked up faking it because the overall % gain doesn’t use 6.95 as his cost basis per share, it uses that as his entire initial investment of the 10 shares (50 post split).

Do the math yourself. Calculate the gains of 6.95 to 821 per share, calculate the gains of 6.95 initial investment to 41.5k current market value. That implies initial share price of well under a dollar. Even look at Tesla’s history and calculate the % gain if you bought at the all time low and held. He fucked up and people here just blindly upvote him like wsbgod.
In this particular case, I was better off selling a credit spread compared to selling a naked put. SRPT crashed from about $160 to $80 after hours on Thursday, so the loss on a naked put would have been about 115-80 == $3500 per contract, instead of the 115-110 == $1500 per contract loss I had with a $115-$110 credit spread. This is true even after taking premium into account.

Trump is objectively a poor president 

The only manufacturer of that measure is himself

People want him in jail because he commits crimes on a daily basis

The supporters killed five people yesterday while storming the capital , and planned many more

That half of the country also thinks there are Kid Kaverns under Central Park, that Tom Hanks is clone, that a 50 year old man who has years of social media praising trump is an antifa plant, that Trump is an agent literally sent by Jesus 

I'm not sure how I can break it down simpler for you

3. You’re gonna lose $300, but its a cheap price to pay. Think of it like tuition.

That’s where you’d be wrong and misinformed. Tesla has a BILLIONS of road miles lead on the second closest competitor in that space (google) the lead is insurmountable. That’s why Tesla is so far ahead. The lead expands every day with every car they put on the road that instantly begins feeding them data. And they have hundreds of thousands doing this in China alone.
Diversity is the key. IMO put 20% in emerging markets
Understandable. Have a great day.
You get at least 2 warrants per 9 shares if you keep holding. The people that sell after a certain date, those warrants are later redistributed to the holders. So if 50% of holders sell, you get 4/9 per share.

I think TSLA should merge with another Car company with positive cash flows and use them to finance the company until TSLA become profitable It shelfs. The dilution would not be that Big since the market cap of TSLA is more than enought. Also It Will prevent the need of future offerings.

So I say there might be a "lucky few" and you bring out ONE example. You literally just proved my point. Also, that fund is closed to investors for almost two decades now and has a relatively low amount of AUM. It is well known that large AUM negatively impact a funds returns. So yes, they may be lucky or they might be geniuses, but betting that YOU can outperform the market because they have is misguided.

Also... ARK literally threw shit at the wall, it struck TSLA and fortunately for them it stuck. You will say that they predicted the price target a few years ago for 2025 and it already hit it now. Well... They also predicted a fleet of robotaxis and full autonomous self-driving that go with that price. How did that go? People are literally licking ARKs ass just because they got uber lucky.

Finally, I bought bítčöín in 2017 at 4k USD. It is now 40k. My annualised return is 122 % which I am pretty sure qulifies as alpha. Am I a genius then? Maybe I should start a fund.

I bought and sold TSLA in 2020 treating it like a regular stock. Sold at 420 on a couple of occasions. On the 4th quarter, I adopted a strategy like yours. If it dips, I just buy more. If it goes up, it’s all good. It’s definitely not going to stagnate like AAPL.

Maybe sometimes. I was just stating that the car is badass. But from an investing approach, I'd put my money on NIO. If Autonomous driving is a goal, safety is the #1 priority. And if you're in China, the most populated area in the world, you cannot have even the slightest margin for error. I think that factor and many others gives NIO an edge long term.

Someone else posted this Medium analysis of CLOV a few days ago and it really changed my view of IPOC... 
[Medium post on CLOV](https://medium.com/@olearykm/a-review-of-the-clover-spac-6a22d000afdb)

TLDR:
CLOV has a shit Medicare Advantage plan

Numbers in the investor presentation are highly misleading and misstate growth/market presentation through sins of omission/outright confusing undefined metrics

CLOV has failed to execute its strategy of growing the Medicare plan

The CEO is a bit shady

The company’s valuation appears to be based on vaporware AI physician assistant tool (Clover Assistant) which everyone and their grandmother has a version of

Future growth might come from Medicare Direct Contracting, but do you trust a guy who failed to expand MA plans to get this next thing right?

“Clover sounds an awful lot like a regional provider-sponsored Medicare Advantage plan that raised a bunch of VC money to build a cool tech platform to support the providers and scale the approach nationally. Unfortunately while Clover was building out the tech it has screwed up on the MA plan and tanked its quality ratings. The MA plan hasn’t demonstrated it can scale anywhere beyond New Jersey — where its friendly providers are — and Clover appears to be shifting its focus to drive future growth by becoming a tech platform / MSO for primary care docs in the nascent Medicare Direct Contracting space. That move certainly may work out well and Clover could take off in that space, but the concept seems more belief-driven than fact-driven at this point based on whats shared in the investor deck. The investor deck as a whole seems at best misleading as to current state of the business.”

Yup
because BE has SOFC (Solid Oxide Fuel Cell) that are likely cheaper to produce than PLUG. 

Also, PLUG is 20B in market cap while BE is $5B in market cap.

This is an extremely oversimplified and uneducated perspective. Lots of things have happened in the past year that drove the stock price up including the split, apple announcing their own chips, apple car news, etc.
I’m done holding NIO. I’ll take the profit before they delisted and all-in in TSLA.
Just a coincidence that average redditor’s current favorite countries like Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, etc. are all homogeneous.

how far do u think it runs? maybe worth selling some otm calls given iv?
I have realized that there is literally no point betting against tesla. If I buy on Monday and it goes up, I win. If I buy on Monday and it goes down, then I buy the dip.

If there is one thing I learnt since early 2020 is DO NOT bet against Elon.

>Reddit has a new paid team called Anti-Evil Operations which goes around permanently banning accounts for saying bad words. We made automod block them so you don't lose your account for saying a word and getting reported. It's not our rule, it's the entire website now, we're just trying to look out for our people. Sorry.

I assume this is for using c*uk. Can we please get a list of words that reddit doesn't like anymore pinned to the top of the sub or in the wiki or something? Thanks pals!
Basically converting some profits into money market which you can use to dollar cost average later on. If you don’t want to take profits, that’s fine as well. Just start saving some more in cash. A crash is inevitable, but it could take years. The most millionaires come out of recessions. Use that time to plan accordingly. Emergency fund in a HYSA, DCA fund in something that can transfer immediately. There’s also a method in which whatever you buy, only buy 50% of it and just hold the rest in cash to DCA. For example, I purchased $5000 worth of KO shares Friday at $49. I could’ve bought $10K worth of shares but I’ll just use the rest as “insurance”. Boring but I haven’t lost money in the long run.
They knew it of course, just they didn't know when it would burst.
Did she suck your cock?
This is the type of news that sells itself. NIO is gonna be so pumped like Tesla. Right this bitch up to $100 and hop off the rocket

The last time the sub was so bullish on TSLA like this it was battery day. Look how that turned out.. not saying it’ll happen again but what has changed in the last 3-4 months? Not much other than the stock price being up another 100%.. remember pigs get slaughtered
My TA says we are up too much.
When you sell a put, you're supposed to buy another put say a lower strike price, to limit your potential downside.
Keep going living your sad pathetic life thinking you will feel better but continuing to feel empty. Keep going you waste of space & oxygen. Keep wasting away you piece of human trash. 😂😂😂
NIO
1. TSLA 1000 1.15 🚀🚀🚀

2. That's because institutional money doesn't care about bubbles.  They are constantly hedging their trades and the % loss they will suffer when it does pop won't compare to the months of gains they've made. It will be retard yolo retail who holds the bag and  smaller money managers who aren't as quick that will suffer the worst.  Especially now since TSLA is in the S&P 500 etfs and other funds will be holding holding bag as well due to the rules.

On the one side you had arson, looting, vandalism, targeted assaults, and murder for months. Many livelihoods destroyed, and all of it was condoned and encouraged by democrats and the media (“where does it say protests have to be peaceful?”, etc.)

I think we can give recognition without always comparing. I believe that's an unhealthy mindset in general.

If 6.95 is the share price of his initial purchase, yes, but the % gain is calculating it as if it’s his entire initial position cost which implies an impossible share price if we break it down based on how many shares his market value number implies he has. Also his daily % gain is impossible no matter what.

I could start a business “painting houses” with that pistol to make money and buy Tesla shares.
ARKK and ARKG very good
I know about a dozen people who own Teslas and they all love them so much, and absolutely rave about their quality (also worth noting this is at a ski resort of all places), so I'm just looking for a more concrete counter example.
The over confidence is just so clear in his comments it’s painful to read, I hope if I hit paydirt like that it doesn’t cloud my judgement so bad. He’s holding fucking shares haha, where’s the upside? Maybe it doubles and Tesla hits 1.5T market cap? Unlikely, and just so much downside risk and so many better risk reward opportunities now if you’re just holding shares
Best thing to do is build what I like to call a “DCA fund”. It’s like an emergency fund, but for market crashes.
Unironically though SPY, QQQ, QQQJ, VOO and maybe a bit of the ARK funds like ARKK or ARKG or ARKF.
Yes, but I hope they finally let the Bills win after making them job to everyone for 20 years.
I dont know what Tesla runs in their car but processing 8GBs of data per second, a 1000w stereo system, heated and massage seats i dont think that whole battery is for the motors lol
He literally told elon to capitalize of it and issue even more shares. I think everyone knows Tesla is going to pop sometime soon it’s just now they want to create as much bag holders as possible
why would you post such a claim and not provide a link for a source????
ARKG. That’s it. That’s the way

hmm, never short TSLA, never....
? Did I do something wrong, I can add what I bought to this. Sorry I have the iq of a turtle.
Nope, Europe first. China cars have never been popular in the US, and now it probly a bad time....
TSLA, PLTR and some GME just to be safe. Also I am not a registered financial adviser, so not use my views as investment advise.

Right, riots are wrong. I have no qualms with peacefully protesting, but trying to paint the BLM protests as the riots but not the 🥭 protests as the riots is disingenuous
Could be like TSLA battery day where there was no way it could ever live up to the hype and then dips a little for a good buying opp.
They are going to make a movie called The Big Gain about this guy, because Burry only got like 500% or so, which are rookie numbers these days.

Fuck ya NIO! I got calls too bro
Elon keeps tweeting about Beetcorn. It’s the same move he did with TSLA 2 years ago when he called it overpriced (at $200 before split) and now TSLA is worth ($880x5). What is he trying to tell us? Pretty sure he’s been using Beetcorn gains to pump TSLA
there's something called volume rate of change, which is used by some to confirm the continuation of a trend (this is from investopedia, but i'm sure you can find in other places):

"To calculate this (volume rate of change, you need to divide the volume change over the last n-periods (days, weeks or months) by the volume n-periods ago. The answer is a percentage change of the volume over the last n-periods. "

But what I'm looking for is a bit different, increasing volume when a stock is going up (like now with tesla) is actually bullish, i'm looking for a capitulation, which should come not at just some volume increase, but at a great volume increase

if you want a visual example, check out MRNA candlestick chart, I think Tesla might be in the same spot is MRNA was on Nov 25, 27, I'm hoping we see volume jump like MRNA on Dec 1, with the same intraday volatility. If this happens, unless the all time high gets breached, the trend would likely to reverse. MRNA dropped from high of 178 to recent low of 104 or so, I hope to catch similar % drop in Tesla.

Even the current gas cars look and feel like cheap plastic toys right now.  It's just the style right now.  EVs need a place to stash the big battery plus they are probably trying to squeeze every efficiency out of them aerodynamically.
Still 42 without TSLA on Friday, which is middle of the road to bullish
Nah priced in
This might stave off GM's bankruptcy, but would have a much greater positive impact on TSLA than GM, because GM's Operating Expense to pay TSLA would fall on their books as recurring software revenue.

In case you are discussing this in good faith:

The difference between Tesla self-driving and Cruise self-driving is that Cruise is sandboxed to small, premapped areas and, because it relies on LIDAR, can only work in perfect weather.  So the future where people no longer own a car and just spend $1 to get an autonomous taxi ride to work is completely and utterly impossible under Cruise.  When it rains, Cruise shuts down, and you can't operate an infrastructure replacement that way.  It would require everyone to own a backup car.

Tesla, on the other hand, was designed to operate in any conditions and anywhere on the map.

So yes, Cruise may be able to perform better in a small pre-defined area under ideal conditions. *If it couldn't, that would be embarrassing.* But Tesla can drive from downtown SF to downtown LA without driver interaction and can do it today, and it can do that anywhere.

Then there are all of Tesla's financial advantages. GM has $120B debt and has to pay high interest rates to raise more, Tesla can raise $10B instantly and debt-free through offerings. Cruise needs to buy and operate their own fleet, at massive capital costs, as well as pay to maintain, charge, and clean them.  Tesla taxi would operate under the Uber model of just taking a cut off the top and use the roughly $100B in customer-paid cars on the road.  Cruise has to pay employees to generate each mile of FSD data to analyze, Tesla just pulls it off cars driving around today for free.  Tesla has a multi-billion mile head start on FSD data, which is how you train AIs.

I'm bullish on Cruise short term, but they can't compete with Tesla long term.
You’re really comparing the first car of the most valuable car company in the world to a Chinese EV? Do you hear yourself?
Well it's mostly due to my younger partying days. When I finished grad school I had something like 16-17 credit cards that were all maxed out or damn near maxed out. I just paid off that last card this past summer. Since then I've managed to save up about 9-10k in liquid cash plus a few K in equities, all while maxing out my 401K and HSA. I still drive my truck that I bought 11 years ago but I'm buried under a lot of student loan debt. Even though I'm on an income based repayment plan, my monthly payments aren't enough to cover interest (before the 0% number kicked in).
After getting dicked by the pooh i aint touch no chyness shit
its insulting to zaxbys to even say theres a comparison to be made
Funny retarded DD. Have an upvote sir!
Internet was wild pre-social media including reddit.

It's sad because people replace reality with the internet. Was better when real life and internet was not connected. 

Upvote/downvote system trains people to behave the same way i.e. joining a hive-mind. 

Social media was one of the worst developments in 21st century. It created siloes of echo chambers - and people spend too much time in these siloes are most at risk. If your silo says vaccines are bad then that's your reality. You'll get downvotes in your silo if you believe otherwise.

All people copy their peers. Unfortunately there's no "good" silo, the only solution is to delete the silos, the upvote/downvotes and let everyone talk to each other. 

Because whatever the silo is, any view gets reinforced and people become more invested into those views.

What's your cost basis? I wouldn't mind waiting a few more weeks to see if this initial pop fades off a bit into the lower teens. I think there is more downside than up in the very short term. Never gotten into any SPACs but I like the fintech sector, valuation seems fair. Growing customer base/revenue. Rare for a startup to be profitable. I like them being a disruptor. Haven't had a chance to look at the dilution potential yet. Need to find that 60-page slide deck and go through it thoroughly this weekend.

She creates her own alpha by getting retail traders to follow her moves, even updating daily. It’s genius, no one has done it before like that. With the advent of pocket trading devices and low/no-cost trades, retail is here to stay, and functionally she’s an Elon Musk visionary in exploiting this sea-change in the markets. 

By the way ARK doesn’t just buy meme stocks at the top, they buy into blood (SRPT -50% down day) and they buy solid value stocks with new-economy upside (MGA).
I think the overall joke of the sub is high risk high reward retarded plays. Hence "Sir, this is a casino." And like I said even casinos can teach you something.

Does anyone else find it amusing that it bounced off 4,420 on friday?
Of the whole automarket. Turned out the industry was undervalued by half, and that half was Tesla. Who knew. (besides this guy, ofc)

Look i know you have to keep telling yourself that so you don't live with crushing guilt the rest of your life, but chopping a baby up inside the womb and sucking them out with a vaccum is not normal and humane. Its sick and evil. Killing our potential offspring is not normal. It disingenuous to make out dismemberment of a fetus to be humane.

Pretty hot. I would.
Don't be retarded and hold this shit forever. Realize how lucky you are that the fed fukked up the financial system this year and caused it to go haywire. Remember in March when TSLA fell 70% when the fed lost control of the market, thats whats waiting for you when the fed lets off the gas.

Sell this shit if the fed ever mentions hiking rates or ending QE, don't be an idiot and lose it all. This was not an investment, it was a lottery ticket that got lucky thanks to the feds stupidity, don't get emotionally stuck with it since it made you a lot of money. I can literally pinpoint exactly on the TSLA chart when the fed began its repo operations in late 2019.
Investment? Ban.
20k on calls reporting for duty
Can't wait to watch tsla crash

Why do you bet against something that's actually working?
Yeah sold 1/15 70c definitely think I'll hit that eow
Literally any Tesla share below PE ratio of 2000 is free money
Tesla being added inflates it so you can't compare it to before it was included

I don't give a damn about the logo.

I do give a damn about GM getting a re-rating on its earnings multiple.  The company is cranking out high margin product as fast as they can make them, and have reduced incentives across the board.  

I'm hoping their keynote at CES will continue to spark some life into what GM will be, so the stock price will reflect that instead of who they were/are, which is a company that would give a damn about logos.

Idk if they are good now.  I got those CMC when they were at the rock bottom Friday.  Someone suggested it and I jumped.  They are up 60% so if CMC pops at all we are in good shape.
So if you banking on a blowoff top to be the catalyst for a prolonged TSLA 🐻 market wouldn't it be wise you know... *to wait for the blow off top to enter your position?*

Standard MBA shit. Focus on the bottom line and the bonuses. No engineers on the board? The second sensor on the MAX was an upsell add on. Shame.

Booking a 1000% gain on a company with a ridiculous PE of 129x is a once in a lifetime opportunity. You can be bullish on Tesla and still realize that. 

Yeah I’m an idiot. A wealthy idiot who rarely loses money.
I got mine through the solar city merger. I sold about half my holdings two days ago. Over 1000% gain. Blind squirrel finding a nut is how I describe it.

Planes are routinely upgraded, parts replaced etc under the guidance of Boeing. Even a 26 yr old plane. Who knows what happened here since they can't even find the plane yet. Just pointing out Boeing planes have been falling out the sky more frequently since they cheaped out on labor.

I agree it was a little dramatic and I don’t think all nvidia chips suck but when someone can make something better and cheaper, yeah it does mean your product sucks. The new nvidia self driving chips are supposed to be pretty good though now that I’ve read some more on them

You underestimate the power of a stupid high stock price my man. He can basically print his own money at this point by selling stock at these valuations. He can use the stock to get infinite loans, etc. Look at Elon's compensation, its all related to the stock, he ain't retarded, he knows where the real money is at which is why hes now the richest man in the world.

The money isn't in selling cars, or batteries, or whatever the fuk you guys think it is. Its in selling stock.
Yes
Okay, let’s look at that. The 4/16/2021 10% OTM ARKG puts are selling for $5.20. In order to make that equivalent to 1 TSLA $780 put, you’d need to sell 8.75 of them, let’s go ahead and round that up to 9. So if you sold 9 of these, you’d get a credit of $46.80. There is no April contract on TSLA, so let’s look at the March contract. The 3/19/2021 $780 put closed at $73.40. 

TLDR: you are incorrect.
If they tasted good

You’re connecting two different things lol. Globalization of a company is one thing, and flying an outdated plane because of lack of regulations and funding is another thing. “Granted it was 26 years old” bro granted? The plane was almost fucking older than me. When’s the last time you think it was brought up to eu/usa/asia flying regulations?

I wonder what’s the oldest Boeing plane in service in the us rn, and when the last time it was brought up to modern safety specs.

Can't do that legally. You'd effectively have state run businesses in that case. Free enterprise is the linchpin of capitalism

Potentially social media. They might dip due to recent events, but the amount of press and outrage is convincing me that people consider social media a truly central part of their lives. If you’re that deep into it, I think it’s more likely you’ll cry on the platform than move off it. 

In order of decreasing risk: TWTR, FB, GOOG, AAPL.
There are safe ways of doing it.. there are 3 in my state and no one even notices them quietly operating.. do some research.

Because the government would need to pass legislation for that. Unless the business violated some law at the time, the government can't just step in and upend that business' model. It would destroy the fabric of capitalism and turn us into China with their state run companies
Naturally. Price just popped.  Who sells that close in?   I was looking when it was 90.  90 to 120 days out.  Premiums get better on a down trend.  

Tesla is more volatile, better premiums close in.  You should notice everything doesn’t trade the same.

I consider myself a libertarian but vote republican. The problem is that since W republicans have spent like drunken sailors. There are very few fiscal conservatives who stand for what they believe in. The problem with the ones that are fiscally conservative also want to push their moral beliefs on others I.e weed legalization. Rand is probably one of the closest to a libertarian/doesn’t just go with the flow.

He was holding a metal tub and eating out of it with a spoon. “What did you call this? Tooter-fish?”

Bill licked the spoon then dumped the whole thing on the floor, stood up and brushed himself off, and said “Nah it’s STRIPE”. Then he walked out without paying

Thanks. I don't recall saying Tesla was producing more Energy than the 4 Major's in Oil. I was pointing out the Comparison that Tesla's Market Cap was NOT 4 times bigger than the top 4 Oil Companies combined. I work in Oil &Gas so I am familiar with all the uses of fossil fuels and their byproducts. If you watch the CNBC interview with Kevin O'leary he discussed how Big Pensions, Funds etc are treating Oil&Gas stocks as TOXIC. IMO this will only expedite the demise of fossil fuels.

How do you know I’m not a millionaire? Is our wealth only judged off stocks?
Let’s go baby
So usually it's based on the equity you hold. If you hold a very volatile stock they would loan out less. For example, I believe if you request a security backed loan on very stable stock such as apple or cocacola, they would loan you maybe up to 95% of the stock value. OTOH, from what I understand TSLA wouldn't receive much % at the moment because it's considered extremely volatile as it's gone up 800% in the past year. Maybe as low as 50% of its current value.
Fellas what’s the next stock to buy? I’m bored of watching PLTR on the daily looking for some extra dopamine

That's really interesting, TIL. And that's the primary criticism I've heard from people in countries with universal care, wait times can be atrocious and there's no incentive to be thorough.

Well if you never sell you will never be a millionaire. So no fuck yous needed.
Yes, if it's outside of an investment savings account then it's 30% capital tax of all my gains. The upside though would be that I could write off my losses.

With investment savings account we pay tax on the total value of the account. Meaning, no matter if you made profit or not you still pay a tax for the total value. So as a quick simple example, if my investment savings account is worth a total of $100k I'd be paying roughly $93.75 in tax.

Agree that public opinion is largely manufactured top down. 

In this case it’s striking that the media is cutting off its own head by attacking the most powerful person in a country where the media has been synonymous with wealth and power since WW2. 

Politicians and media companies are playing similar games appealing to broad audiences to win support and money, they’ve often worked synergistically. 

I don’t agree with you that this reaction isn’t proportional to Trump’s behavior. And its Always Trumpers who are scorching earth and are prepared to tear down the nation for him so I don’t buy the “not applying logical criticism” thing either. People want people who commit crimes to go to jail. They found how many bombs and guns in backpacks and trucks around the Capitol this week?

Expensive, yes. Tired, hardly. It's much more than a CRM — Pardot is one of the best marketing automation tools you can get. With Slack integration, communication between marketing and sales teams will all live inside Salesforce making it easy to collaborate. If you don't like logging your activities, you're just lazy and likely trying to hide the real way you spend your time — browsing reddit and facebook.

The Slack acquisition looks like a larger play at enterprise. Slack and Tableau are adds that directly compete with Microsoft in Teams and Power BI. They’re working their way upstream on the value chain. CRM has bigger goals than expanding their sales footprint.

What I want to know is, who do we view like /r/investing views us? 🤔
Does anyone know when HFT really took a hold? Early 2000's?

Specifically I set up 5 credit spreads with a 20% weekly yield. It went off so I then did 6 spreads with a 17% yield (20% to principle investment), then 7, etc, until the spreads are so deep they're resistant to any initial drop and keep spitting out 20%/wk
I love how when a loser analyst say a stock is a sell, he’s an idiot. 

But when he says buy, you take his advice
Because I stopped going all in after the first few times. I have a strategy built up now that I take some profits and buy shares, and take some profits to build a bigger bankroll to invest. I’ll invest a portion of the bankroll on calls, and leave a portion behind to buy more calls incase that call ends up losing. At this point I’ve rode the wave long enough that I can take several losses with this strategy and still come out ahead. Once TSLA has red days 3-4 times in a row I’ll just be done and take my profits.

It’s not without its benefits but also think about when people talk about cutting the DOD budget 1/3 of that is personnel costs with a significant portion being for healthcare. Also, you know why we do PT across the DOD? Not combat readiness because my ability to run 1.5 miles has no bearing on my ability to fly. It’s to reduce healthcare costs from diabetes and heart disease. Literally that was the sole reason the AF had a waist measurement as part of its PT tests.

I’ll give you a hint, they make less than 80k a year. The lack of self awareness is astounding.
Also this
"One of the issues we have to deal with is, with the proliferation of these algorithmic, high-frequency traders, some of these algorithms don’t take into account the fundamentals of the instrument, the economic value, the dividends, the status of the municipality issuing them. They are simply saying, ‘if enough of these are sold then we start selling, and then if we start selling another algorithm kicks in.’ To the extent that we get further away from the economic values here, does that not only cause concern, but is that something that’s good for the economy? 

This is why I despise HFT.

Yes. was cool. There is a discusson post on wsb.
It's never a bad thing to have long plays in your pocket. Tesla was a long play a few years ago.
Nice gain, but all of your comments on never selling I don't understand. Tesla valuation is quite clearly a bubble and it may take a few months or a few years but it's damn well going to come back to reality. Tesla doesn't even have room to double in the short term w/ out becoming the size of Amazon.

Why not find "the next Tesla", an up and coming company that is poised for growth, or if you want to play it safer with such a large position, at least a company with a more sane P/E ratio.

A smart man told me commodities are the play with all this new stim. So I bought more PLTR calls
Twitter can. But I would also argue the government also needs to step up scrutiny on buyouts. Facebook/twitter are the big players. If someone creates a new platform they will buy them out. Restrict their ability to stifle competition and then let them moderate as they see fit.

I don't agree with twitter banning right wing people. I don't like those people but I don't think as many people who get influenced by their tweets would be otherwise safe from that same line of group think. If it doesn't happen online it will happen in person-- like at community meetings etc.

How so
The current problem with EV planes is the amount of batteries you need to power the thing add to the weight of the plane, which in turn requires more batteries. Basically an equation that cannot be solved yet. If anyone can do it though, it's our lord and savior Elon Musk.
I agree with this, and want to add: one of the big draws to social media is to be able to talk shit to "the other side" and get a reaction. The people who leave will get board without that kind of satisfaction.
For the autists in here.

Morality exists at the very least as a social construct, if nothing else.

It seems humans are capable of hypercooperation in the form of accepting socially-held normative rules and this cooperation (such as the widespread indoctrination of how property rights work) itself has market value.

In other words, even the nihilists know that morality is useful.

But, for a less autistic argument -- if you have any notion that it is good to avoid cognitive dissonance and you also have will to act, then you can conceive of rules for your behavior in the form of establishing self-consistency. Then, unless you seriously believe solipsism, this implies morality. And you probably shouldn't believe other people don't exist if you believe in buying stocks.

In other words, other people exist and you probably like for them to treat your tendies the way you'd want your tendies to be treated.

There are only two places the market can end up -- dead or the moon. A critical mass of solipsists are how it ends up dead.

What the fuck am I doing here?

.During the last five trading days, volume in put options has lagged volume in call options by 63.29% as investors make bullish bets in their portfolios. This is among the lowest levels of put buying seen during the last two years, indicating extreme greed on the part of investors.

I've definitely heard both sides; countries with socialized healthcare seem like the best model, to me, to pay attention to with regards to its efficacy. The current state of the average American's health doesn't seem to point to taking better care of yourself because healthcare is poor. I don't think there's any reason to believe people will "let themselves go" just because healthcare is readily available, I think the opposite is possible - more people won't put off (or skip) routine care and preventative measures are a lot cheaper than treating a full blown illness. And I honestly don't know anything about the average enlistee, but assume they're generally treated like shit; seduced by "patriotism," treated like second class citizens.

Age of the plane honestly means nothing. It’s the maintenance practices. If you have a 26 year old plane and you’re throwing in all the new tech, throwing on better engines to save money on gas, changing shit out in general. That can easily throw of the CG (center of gravity) which can cause the auto pilot features and other stuff to not calculate correctly, or, if it’s true about the fuel valve not working correct or whatever exactly it was. That could be a old part that can’t handle the new stuff. If the aircraft sat there for awhile due to covid then they just hopped on it and tried to fly, that can cause problems as well. So many different factors.
I have no clue, just almost never worth it to hold through earnings unless they’re just a few lottos or something

I’m thinking in broader terms. Obviously NIO will have a large customer base in China but the American market is very important for any car manufacturer. Tesla still outsells NIO in China. Every car manufacturer (that sell well in the US) will also bring EVs to the table. Where will that leave NIO? You’re betting that patriotism alone will sell cars?

And finally, would you drop 70,000 dlls on a Chinese car?

Yeah, buying at ATH is tough. My stop limit order is still pending for additional shares. I don't have a problem buying at ATH but need some extra confirmation. Basically if we cross Friday's high on Monday, my order will execute getting me in at the high, hopefully with a slightly more likely chance that we continue to make new highs.
The market has taken all of the market cap skepticism and focused it singularly on PLTR.

[If you read this extremely long article, you would realise why inflation is certainly coming and why 2008-2009 crisis response was completely different than this time around.](https://www.lynalden.com/fraying-petrodollar-system/)
Deflation won't be an issue. Government is doing a shit ton of deficit financing(modern monetary theorists are winning) and deflation would wreak havoc on our capability to pay down our debt.

The scale of this deficit financing would almost certainly lead to inflation. Velocity of money has also risen slightly. Fed itself is warning of inflation and has taken the stance that they are ready to accept inflation higher than 2% if the mean is 2%.

People are expecting even more stimulus==more deficit financing.

Also, we are having historic supply shortages in almost all products(unbelievable to think, but it is what it is).

2.

Also, the fed or the government is not really directly propping up the stock market. This is just the result of their actions. They are not directly buying stocks. People are.

Fed action to stabilise the bond market, government spending, low interest rate etc are creating excess liquidity and is indirectly leading to stocks being more attractive than any other investment source. 

Numerous fancy investment vehicles(that must not be named) are crossing one after another record. This points to the possibility that institutional and retail investors are running out of places to invest their money.
direct list you make no money. you need IPO

Salesforce is an expensive, tired product. Nobody who uses it loves it. They are an incumbent ripe for displacement as soon as somebody figures out how to eliminate all the non-revenue generating, redundant, wasted, time we all spend in salesforce.

Salesforce sells mgmt on “if it’s not in salesforce, it didn’t happen”

In practice this looks like an entire sales team spending a day daily/monthly/quarterly entering in fake “no answer - vm left” calls in order to bring their activities up. Most people don’t feel like going through  5-10 clicks for every call that the client didn’t pick up the phone.

Yeah in my area a sizable amount of people stopped caring a long time ago.  

Most still wear masks in the grocery store, but I've seen a few that are not.  Some events still happen, dining still happens, etc.  After around August a lot of people here just sort of gave up on it.  

I should also mention covid cases began soar around that time too (and continue to stay high)... but I think mentally most people here would rather risk it than stay stuck inside or even wear a simple mask.  For good or bad.

I think it's going to be awhile before we go back to 'normal' nationally though.  Office jobs won't force people back into the office until more (all?) people are vaccinated.  That's going to take time.  Mine has approved remote work until June or July already.

Another big issue is a lot of these people (skirting mask and distancing rules) don't trust the vaccine yet.  So it remains to be seen how deep and widespread the coronas will linger due to this. 

I suspect the first half of this year will look a lot like last year and the latter half will slowly transition into a more 'normal' view.  This is mostly just a transitory year.  2022 is the real prize.

Honestly pickup trucks are a booming market. The cyber truck and model y sales are going to be high and even though it’s “priced” in they are gonna cause the price to soar.

Regarding Bidens $10,000 student loan forgiveness...Does this mean, the gov. will give lump sum payments to these student loan lenders for each student in debt? The reason I ask...

If student loan issuers / companies are getting $10,000 per student that they normally would not be getting (i.e. individual cannot pay back), we are talking about a very large windfall for these companies. It might be worth identifying the companies, and investing in them.

Old plane model and an airline that has poor history of aircraft maintance.   
In 2019, its own director of safety recommended grounding the airline.  
Could be boeing but most likely not...

On the flip side of the universal healthcare talk, talk to any military member who is basically on single payer healthcare and listen to their horror stories... take Motrin is basically a veteran meme. My biggest problem beyond the bureaucracy of single payer is the fact that there is no economic incentive to be healthy, I’m not talking about preexisting conditions I’m talking obesity, smoking, alcohol consumption. Heck even something as simple as brushing your teeth has less incentive. Now I’m not a policy wonk so I don’t know what the proper answer is. I do think trump made some good policies in health care.  Americans should not be subsidizing European single payer systems by charging us higher prices than the Europeans and there should be price transparency of what something costs when you go to the doctor.

They are, but they get special treatment (section 230) that removes copyright and other risk from them because they are an open platform. If they are now choosing who gets to use their services they need to have their special treatment reevaluated and be open to being sued for what they host like a private company.

Howd you afford that many shares in the first place?
Helpful, thanks! I somewhat agree, and have a $64c that expires EOW so I'm wondering when I should sell and think you're right that it may likely end up being earlier than later.
Its just disappointing to see these people who think they're being conservative not actually realize gains. There is definitely a lot of risk being long tsla. If tslas share price decided to be based in reality next week, this guy will lose a million dollars.

It all depends on the details that come out before Monday. Seems like it wasn't a 737, but that could be worse. It was an older plane, if they blame it on them using an old plane that was collecting dust for a year that could actually help Boeing. Details matter a lot with this play.
This sub is depressing. The thrill of gambling all your money is worth way more than the 10$ a month these dudes are earning.

I’m shocked how many people don’t understand market cap. Millions of “investors” really think that if a stock is $2 it’s bound to go up. If Tesla or apple split to go back to $2 it would triple in a month. We are reaching levels of RETARDISM that shouldn’t be possible.
It's not the age of the plane. It's the airline standards in Indonesia that suck.
Idk what the airlines guidance is,so this is purely speculation. But for the Boeing AC I fly (rotary not fixed wing) for maintenance purposes they have to be started every 14 days. First question would be If there is something like that in their maintenance manual. Second, were they doing it? Regardless of the maintenance, sad thing that happened.

If I remember right, the $600 is based off your tax filing status from last year. If you were a dependent then, you won’t get the $600. If the Recovery Rebate Credit Remains, then theoretically you could claim the $600 that was given out on next years taxes.

Its twitters right to mod their platform how they wish. There shouldn’t be laws forcing Twitter to change their website terms and conditions. That said, we have the right to our opinion. And if you disagree with Twitter’s rules then you go create or use a different platform. If enough people agree with you, then Twitter won’t be popular anymore and everyone else would go to the other website.

Looking to pull the same feat this year but with $250k. I will follow your plays. I just don't trust PLTR so that one's out for me. I'm checking NIO, CRSR, GME, AMD and others but I would rather sell LEAP puts way above stock price if I expect a strong rise this year. This generates a much higher ROI.
Yea should be smooth sailing for now
so calls on ba!!
Ohh I agree that censorship is stupid, but I also don’t agree with anyone forcing a company to act/work a certain way because one side or the other got their feels all hurt cause they were targeted and banned. 

It’s unhealthy to create an echo chamber where everyone all thinks the same and regurgitates confirmation bias. But we as a society have already mostly split to do that exact thing so healthy debate is lost and most people can’t see/hear an opposing idea without losing their shit. 

Companies trying to silence one side of a political spectrum aren’t helping matters but it’s their right to shit on their own plate at the same time.

The specific plane model in the BA accident is an old one that is mostly retired in US but used in some other countries because it is cheaper to buy them but probably more risky to operate. This may be a wake up call for some airlines to renew their planes. Sad day...
We get to leave institutions holding the bag? Okay.

What ever happened to the RBLX ipo?
If a model 3 that is leased to say a ride sharing company and it crashes, you think consumers and investors dont give a shit?
Because you're only pushing the problem further down the road. I get what you're saying, open up the faucet and let the $$$ flow. But that relies on people giving up their goods and services for said cash and the assumption that what they're receiving in return has good value today and tommorow.

The food problem can be solved overnight if the government actually cared. Eviction and foreclosure can't because of the complex web woven over the last few decades. 

The economy isn't as easy as people think it is. Even small measures can backfire. People who worked their whole lives and saved as opposed to reckless spending and voting got killed by the fed. They might have cash on hand now but why would they spend. There isn't any motivation. What can they get by buying a new car, a house or spending on other discretionary items today that adds value to their lives
the problem is that there is literally 0 volume for the options. the calls  that looks hte most juicy, are the 10$ march or june ones. guess what hte volume is though. 0 . and OI is 1 and 5.  so if you get into options on this its looks like ur only option with volume is the 8$ call. they are still relatively cheap. might throw a few down for a lotto play

Let me get this straight.  Both Chamath Palihapitiya and Peter Thiel are backing IPOE?!?!

If you aren’t in IPOE then it’s a cold hard fact that you hate money.  You might as well liquidate all your assets for cash, withdraw all your money from the bank, put it in a big pile in your backyard and pour gasoline on it and light it on fire.

If you aren’t in IPOE then show yourselves so the mods can flair you accordingly
If you’re not pumping money into TSLA, idk what else to tell ya. This is like my 8th comment in the last month saying this and it continues to grow. I’m right till I’m wrong, but you’re gonna regret in your 70s why you didn’t take more risks when you were younger. All it takes is a few wins, and your gains will more than cover your losses when (if) the bubble pops. Look at me now. I’ve set aside so much TSLA gains that TSLA could tank for a week straight and I’ll still be up a ton and I would just stop there.

That's totally fine, it's a nice rocket. I just don't agree that there's much reason why tesla couldn't quite easily be overtaken by other manufacturers, making the hype the only driver of price.

Why not direct list? Sec has made is easier and they can capture the sentiment and raise a ton of capital as opposed to going the SPAC route
>money needs to be taken from rich folks and given to poor folks

That's not the solution. If it was, then lottery winners and pro athletes wouldn't be filing for bankruptcy like it's going out of style. If it was the solution, welfare would get people back on their feet.

Something about giving a man a fish versus teaching a man to fish, or whatever.
If PLTR has a 20% week I may become rich
Lmao.

You guys ran PSTH to 50% of NAV.  

Also, be careful of the SPAC bubble going foward.  Companies may direct list rather SPAC.

So all those rich NAV premiums may go 0 (10 per share) if targets aren't found.

I played the spac bubble before the direct listing change.

I own IPO D/E/F, GSAH, AJAX and PSTH. The other spacs have garbage management team.

Same, this would be first. Fomo v. Cucked, take your pick.
fuck you are dumb. 

what do you classify as poor? the working poor or those currently non employable as a result of skill or behavior? 

what i just offered is the working poor to  receive stock options and dividends fuck face. 

if the majority of the market is owned by x and x is forced to sell y% of their assets there physically isn't enough money or buyers to buy the assets at the current price which results in the price dropping.

things you don't fucking grasp.

Only thing PLTR is good for is selling options to dumb fucks, since the spread is so thin it's like  trading shares.

You may as well have wasted your time on boomer stocks.
It’s crazy how that shit happens.. 26 years no issues and then suddenly it crashes leaving dozens of people dead. I would’ve thought it was a new plane or something idk
You have to go to the bank to buy physical stock for the more obscure tickers, like BRK or MA
would have only taken 1-2 days for the shitty result then.

Another way of looking at market cap for Tesla, is the- Market Cap Per Car sold each year. 

Tesla sold/delivered 499,550 cars in 2020, and Tesla's market cap was 834 billion as of today giving it a $1,669,502 per car metric.

Comparatively speaking, Volkswagon's market cap is around 105 billion with around 11 million cars sold/delivered each year-giving it a $9,550 per car metric.

They have to sell to keep their weighting down because it’s gone up so much. I believe they try to stay under 10%. Ark is still TSLA’s #1 bull.

they weren't over extended in the 08 crisis and didnt need a bailout, if they played the game like wallstreet or hollywood, theyd be at 100.

Ark auto buy and sells a lot of their stocks in their different ETFs based on weight. Tesla stock keeps rising and if the total weight becomes greater than say 5% of the total, then they sell.

ARK is selling off some Tesla to keep it under 10% of the portfolio, which has already happened before. 

Thank god I didn't listen to any of the fucking retards who have been saying to sell. 

If you're holding, man up and ride the fucking wave.
I’ve peeled 60K off my February calls I bought a couple of weeks ago, still holding 40K

Considered dumping it completely on the ER pop yesterday, but there are too many positive stock and sector tailwinds/catalysts on the horizon not to keep some skin in the game 

For the sector I’m also holding an additional $500K in NVDA AMD TSM calls.

Bullish

This gets posted every other day.. ARK aims to have Tesla 10% of their fund. If it goes up 20%, they trim it back to keep it at 10%. They have been selling forever now

NIO, NVIDIA team up to develop self-driving EVs
NIO Inc. announced on Saturday it formed a partnership with NVIDIA Corp. with the aim of developing a new generation of electric vehicles with advanced automated driving capabilities.

The Chinese electric vehicle maker said that NVIDIA's Orin system-on-a-chip, dubbed Adam, will first appear in its flagship ET7 sedan starting 2022. The car itself was launched today at an event in Chengdu.

"Autonomy and electrification are the key forces transforming the automotive industry. We are delighted to partner with NIO, a leader in the new energy vehicle revolution-leveraging the power of AI to create the software-defined EV fleets of the future," Jensen Huang stated in the press release.

The problem is free speech is not guaranteed on a businesses platform, one that mind you is free to use. 

They have rules set, can change rules at will and can do whatever they like. That’s them practicing their freedoms. 

You don’t have a right to do whatever you want when you’re using someone else’s platform. It’s theirs to do with and moderate as they see fit. 

I say all of the above and I’ll close with this, I’m not siding with Twitter or FB or any of them on their chosen targets. I am however siding with them as to it’s their prerogative to do so. 

Freedom either works both ways or not at all, it can’t be selective.

The way developing countries train, qualify, and advance their pilots is incredibly different than how we do it. For example, the co-pilot in the Ethiopian crash had a mere 200 hours of flying, which is nothing. In the United States you need 250 hours (not part 141) to receive money for flying, and 1500 to get your airline transport pilot rating. Then type ratings, etc. I'm afraid as travel booms back internationally over the next few years we will see a lot more airplane crashes due to an increase in developing country airlines and complete lack of experience in their pilots.

Correct me if I’m wrong, but if Tesla crashes 50/60/70% wouldn’t it just rise up faster than ever before? Personally I own 2 shares as of yesterday (stupid, I know...) but if it crashed, I would buy 20 without doubt. And so would the other people who keeps saying it’s expensive and didn’t jump on the FOMO train?

On the other hand, if they reveal a big new contract. This could immediately create a violent move to the upside.
I agree. They're buying up corporate bonds, etc. but this money is mostly not going to make it to employees. Companies should take this money to R&D, and try to raise their revenue to raise their stock prices and increase wages, but most of them are too busy raising their ticker prices through buybacks which do nothing for fundamentals and paying the management. I'm thinking the bottom up approach is better also, but with a lot of money spending avenues stopped due to lock up, maybe they aren't sure how effective it will be?

Only way I'm seeing to survive financially in the looming inflation is like everyone on this sub. Yolo everything to hit it big so I can raise my net worth before this mega inflation hits. If my dollar is going to be worth less, I need to have way more of it and fast lol

That's technically true, but all that downward trend had that retard stressing out for ultimately like $300 of profit after over half a year. Lmao

Hope some of you lurkers do some actual math on your bets and the value of your time.

Tesla will make more profits than any of these manufacturers with 1/10th the the cars. 

But besides that Tesla will sell/own 20 million Robotaxis a year around 2030. Those cars that are as a service will generate approximately 100k in revenues per year. Let's say only 50k of that is pure yearly profits. Each $25k taxi would generate 200% additional profit margin per year.

Re: Faking YOLO screenshots

Or did you just change the html source to the values you wanted?

500 to 100K in 50 days is highly probable.  It would be more probable that you just change the html source so it renders the values you want.

This goes for many YOLO screenshots that look impossible.

You can just set up a local web server to display  what you want or changed RH html code and connect to it with your phone and take a screenshot.

 Easy hack for karma whores and pumpers.

Does $MSFT report first? It’d sure as hell try to discern if Microsoft CRM took any market share from Salesforce.

Also scan social media to see if you can find anecdotal stories of people at firms going from Salesforce to MS CRM, or vice versa.

Why would index funds have to rebalance? I thought index funds have shares proportional to the value of each company. So if TSLA is 1% of the S&P, 1% of the index fund is Tesla shares. If Tesla’s value gets cut in half, the value of their shares automatically drops to .5% of the fund without them selling any shares.

Hate to break it to you but apple has only dumped 1 time on earnings in the last 2 years, Tesla is a result of quite the opposite, people love to short it but then quickly realize they fucked up and cover, almost like a reverse bubble, were the doubters are the ones pumping the stock in a never ending feed back loop.
Don’t sell them now when Tesla is still going to have bull run until interest rates go back to normal and inflation kicks in. Hedge funds wouldn’t crash it now since too many retirement money is in Tesla and that it would bring the rest of the market down with it. So they would need a good reason to crash it. I hope you’re at least selling OTM covered calls though... you just need 20 more shares to sell another cc. Also, if you keep reinvesting your cc, I am sure you’ll double your money by EOY.

I’ve learned from this thread that many on WSB aren’t actually joking or trying to be ironic when they call people “worthless”. Yikes. I don’t want to live in a world where that’s the default way to view other people. 

Some of you are right fucked in the head.
Bro there's no way he goes from 300-100k without having sold some positions along the way. Its damn near impossible to get that high in a single position. I know its been done but OP said in a different place in the thread that he actively traded. If he didn't, or only sold in 2021, then you're  right and he doesn't need to worry about it for a while. However i doubt that's the case
No clue.

Yeah dude I know the anxiety over the weekend would have out weighted the Friday gain. I mean fuck, 70% portfolio in a single day!? That is far and away the biggest single day gain I have ever seen. 40%? Good chance I would be a greedy pig. I did buy a $58 1/29 NIO call at close to scratch that “let it ride” itch but outside that and some steel/weed I’m sitting on a mountain of cash.
Holy fuck that looks awful.  How fucking stupid.

Might as well buy calls, because somehow this is bullish

Can you explain this “like” I’m retarded?
Being someone who used to think libertarianism was about the only place I fit in ideal wise. After enough time spent talking to libertarians I realized I don’t fit with them either, sure we align similarly 

But fuck too many of them are just as blindly following an ideology as liberals and conservatives, except they’re way more annoying about their feelings of ideological superiority

Now when I end up in a discussion of political ideologies and someone says “well what are you?” I just say “none of them, they’re all assholes vying for power and I only align with shared ideals but I don’t fit into any of their spectrums” 

I just want to make money and keep as much of it as I can to do whatever I feel like doing with it

I forget what it’s called, but there’s a clone of Reddit that got some attention when some of the MAGA and incel subs were banned and people were worried about freedom from censorship and all that. Last I checked it’s basically still those two groups amplified a bit, with some non-English posts. Not the healthiest base for a social media platform. I’m sure their mods are trying to keep down the federal crimes, but it did seem to be an issue for a bit. I haven’t checked it out on a good while.

Because tesla is not just a car company, it creates batteries, solar panels, owns charging stations and has alot more potential. Im not going to say that the current valuation is rational but it's valued as a tech company and it is one. Also 'every' engineer wants to work at Tesla, the same cannot be said about Ford or BMW...

I fully agree with you. But at the same time the world keeps going and going. If you're on this subreddit you're probably looking for ways to make money off of buying and selling stocks without considering the impact that you yourself may have on the industry. If you're commenting on this subreddit you're probably doing so on a device made in china and therefore support massive mistreatment of underpaid individuals in a second world nation and possible sweat shops or child labor. Long story short, we're all shit.
Literally 100s of ways to make money every week and you're bagholding for something that might happen.
Or did you just change the html source to the values you wanted?

Covid deflationary pressure is due to dollar velocity faceplanting, see [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M2V). The FED “printed” I think like $4T end of Q2 2020 and their balance sheet ballooned. The liquidity programs calmed down, but the unwinding of the FEDs gigantic balance sheet never really happened after 2008. See FED balance sheet over time. So when the world opens again, if they don’t front run increases in interest rates (they won’t) we get $4T of inflation straight to the face, assuming velocity recovers quickly and to bear pre pandemic levels. Propping up the stock market is doing essentially nothing for the economy, except maybe realtors whose clients work at Tesla. That’s because giving money to the rich indirectly by lowering rates and via bank liquidity means they invest it. Stimulus checks are spent immediately and that money has real velocity. Hypothetical bottom up stimulus approach: you buy tendies, grocery store pays suppliers and employees, employees buy shit, suppliers buy shit and pay employees, they buy more shit. That’s some proper monetary velocity right there. You should trust me too, I failed CFA Level II.

I think I would have slept better if I sold my Tsla 850C 15jan21. Limit order was 50c away from a fill when market closed.
It’s cheaper than TSLA
But this is not 737 max.
Yup coming down to 99 dollars again. I will jump on it this week. If it comes down  by 15-20% down.
Problem is the retirement fun and unions. They legit cant switch up fast enough to compete with agile TSLA and the Chinese. Even VW was having a union crisis due to unions not wanting to make EVs
If they are ITM theta wont eat as way as much because of the options intrinsic value
EZ decision
asking myself the same question. gonna get rid of 500 shares on Monday morning
If it were me, I'd ban everyone at the drop of a hat to bring exposure/liability to 0.
maybe that’s it but i think it’s production as well. So many Fords are just Mazadas with Ford shit on them. They’re poorly built and lack so many features which would be basic on a Toyota.
Did you listen to it, or are you just stating an opinion with an agenda?

Great trade, but you haven't made a penny. You don't make a profit till you book it.

You have to stop trying to apply any logic other than pure FOMO to the price of this stock. I say this as someone with $70k tied up in a CSP on it.
[removed]
the thing is , why not selling at this all time high , and inject this money into a safe stock or even on a tracker ?

You can still borrow large amount with your trade account but it will be way way safer.
It was the same case as BABA and JD, until they were recently listed on HKEX
giving the government more money wont fix the issue. have the companies give dividends and stock to their employees will. 

giving more money to the government only makes it more attractive option for corrupt people.

put rules in place for a person to sell off assets after x results in price deflation of assets making it so more things are owned by more people and the high wealth generation is spread among more people. 

should be high enough only .1% ever actually hit x to avoid a full on deflation spiral.
“Investigating”
Yeah, pretty sure I've seen this whole "win the executive and legislative branches and squander all political capital" cycle play out again and again over the last 16 years. Same folk been at the wheel.
I talked to Santander about it but am doing my research to find the best option. Robinhood offers it too essentially with the loans they offer via robinhood gold. Much more enticing at 2.5% now too
What did you end up getting?
Mark my words, 1 year from now GOEV at $30+. If I'm wrong, I will do no nut November again even though I really like almonds and walnuts.
So to confirm, ITM calls aren’t as affected by theta as much? I sold some 1/15 calls last week because I was afraid theta would eat away
When where link?
If it drops below $200 I'm buying.
People died and you're worried about corny jokes. You "Praying for your joke that your making fun of, imagine if you were on that plane, you wouldn't have been able to even make this corny ass post. Smd
If he didn’t sell in 2020 he doesn’t owe any taxes for 2020. You only owe taxes if you sell and realize the gain. If something you own goes up 500% in 2020(and you don’t sell) and then drops down to the same price you purchased it at some time in 2021 and then you sell, you don’t pay any taxes for either year because in neither of those years did you make any gains.
Comments like this make me believe the top is in.

I’m a noob, what’s good about QYLD?
Never bet against Tesla. But what about Volkswagen for a long term hold? Share price is still accessible to us poorer people, have major brands in every segment, and have committed to r&d in electric cars/platforms that can be used in all of the companies they own.

Do Tesla cars have an incredible margin? I don’t get how they are so much more valuable than most car companies by multiple magnitudes. Even if they capture like 70% of the car market (unrealistic and ridiculous) how much would their profit be?

It’s not much but I was going down a small rabbit hole and found a lot of spacs that he was interested were on the 2020 CNBC disruptor list ( https://www.cnbc.com/2020/06/16/meet-the-2020-cnbc-disruptor-50-companies.html ) stripe number 1 coupang number 2 also Airbnb sofi dash and several others were targeted by spacs  recently. Anyway I just randomly googled coupang and Bill Ackman and it turns out he was an early investor in them. Now coupang is the Amazon of South Korea and we saw the hype btwn got when they tried for tokopedia and that’s Indonesia. S Korea is a developed country so this is even better imo.

no. No more splits. Elon is looking rougher and rougher the higher the price goes. Think he knows a crash will fuck him like the model 3 delivery in 2018
Nope, im almost 100% invested in the market with a little bit aside in cash for daily expenses. But if i was up 100k in short term gains you better believe ill take off the table what i need to pay in taxes in a few months.
Good morning fellas, proud to say that BA crash is most likely priced in. See, they have statistics that for every 1 million flying hours of the specific plane, theres a X% chance of having a crash and this is it. It's already bound to happen. All in all, bullish cuz this news is just a publicity stunt and u know what they say, there aint no such thing as bad publicity.

Yeah they make the expedition EL I mean Max way better
Don't do this. You'll end up getting it for whatever premium you set. So if it opens Monday red, you're automatically down because you put a buy in for a higher initial price
Kinda hope so, just to load up on shares. Literally can never lose on shares.
The first minute of opening is wild. Depends on the order book. Sometimes options sold by retailers won't be priced properly but these tend to get picked up by institutional options sellers so they make an immediate profit.
Congrats chief but I have no idea if that is like 10 freedom dollars or 10,000

Of course my opinion is that of an amateur- I have 85% of my portfolio in Tesla 😂

There's tickers other than TSLA, BA, PSTH, PLTR, GME?

How TF do you guys find these tickers?
Agreed. I think F’s electric vehicles and automation division is trying and they have a good CEO who wants to innovate but the bean counters are so fucking stingy for that stuff in legacy auto

That’s how you kill a company
You think Tesla will be less than $1,000 2 years from now? Nah. Unlikely.
Fair enough, I was a bit over the top. I don’t like him as a person, but can respect SOME of his business acumen.
Aren't they getting thrown off of App Store?
Do you think Tesla will split at 1000
Thoughts on buying crispr now? Been waiting for a dip but haven’t seen shit
I think that, like taxes, it could be a tiered program subsidised by the government, eg a business only pays a percentage of their gross, something like that. I'm all for universal healthcare since it accomplishes two things: small businesses don't need to worry about those details and healthcare is no longer attached to employment. I'm paying for healthcare through the Marketplace and it's pretty crap, over 300a month and it didn't even cover my flu shot at Walgreens (but it has a decent yearly deductible to protect against catastrophe).

I disagree with your third point actually, them taking a stance and banning accounts that go against their TOS is going to paint them in a more positive light I think. In fact, pretty much everything I’ve seen saying short twitter gives Twitter not banning far right people violating TOS as a reason to short them because it makes dems in Congress think they allow violence to happen.
If you’re trading on weekly basis with options Tesla probably has room to run. I’m talking about next few years. NIO leaps are a good idea.

I’d rather buy puts when vol is low. Historically stocks don’t drop out when volatility is high. Buying long puts when volatility is low is the smart decision.

That NIO news was a pleasant surprise this morning. Market can still fuck me, but I think there's a good chance I get a multi-bagger by Thursday.
Ah yes, spending money on vacation, drugs, booze, fast food really help with advancing technology and science.

As a literal gay autistic 1.5gen immigrant, I roomed with an "median" American couple in their 50s to save money and I know what it is like. They are decent people but their life simply doesn't produce much of material value beyond what they consume.

I also lived in the ghetto when I was really poor, and many there will be barely attached to the workforce because they will not be useful than cashierless checkout.

You are just another useful idiot who can't bare the fact that stuff like IQ is real, unequal between people, and about half genetics. Have a review paper.

http://europepmc.org/article/MED/26817721

>1. All psychological traits show significant and substantial genetic influence

>Psychological domains that have traditionally focused on individual differences are those that have been studied most using genetically sensitive designs, primarily the twin method that compares resemblance in pairs of identical and fraternal twins: cognitive abilities and disabilities, psychopathology, personality, substance use and abuse, and health psychology. Traits in these domains have consistently shown significant genetic influence in adequately powered studies (Plomin et al., 2013),

Thank you Papa Elon. 

1. Gained some on a shitload of SPXU shares at the beginning of the pandemic. I thought $1k was a lot of money then.
2. Recovery started, I was sure we hadn’t found the bottom yet so I held a bunch of SPXU and lost a shitload of money.
3. Figured out options, bought NKLA calls before the merger but was out of day trades so I lost most of the gains the next day. 
4. Continued to buy stupid options. Eventually gave up for a little bit. I was down around $8K at this point.
5. Had one TSLA option worth $100 at one point, it popped and I started getting interested again.
6. Started buying TSLA calls, didn’t take gains when I had them.
7. TSLA calls in the last week made me break even and more.

Define soared.. If you bought in March, I suppose it has.  If you bought in October - December when everyone began peddling it here, it's up maybe 15%.
I was looking for a 100% ROI (annual). With those $80 puts expiring worthless in 12 months I calculated 111% ROI. Now that dropped to 83%. Still ridiculous if it would work out but I'm aiming for 100% so I will wait for the next drop or I'm going to search for other plays.

Infrastructure plays, green energy plays, EV plays, and tech plays are probably the best bets right now. Infrastructure and green energy because Biden wants to pass a multi trillion dollar infrastructure and green energy Bill. EV because a lot of states are trying to switch to only allowing EV to be sold. Tech because tech historically has done well under democrat presidents.

Honestly censorship of Trump’s Twitter while I see the benefit given what has happened, I think could be a dangerous slippery slope moving forward. I hate Trump and all of his antics, but what worries me is that slippery slope that CAN happen not what WILL happen. They could start this censorship now as Trumps twitter allows a path given that it’s already started on Facebook and now Twitter. I get the idea is “violence” but the terms and conditions could seriously change to censor speech. 

Also, I just watched a bunch of people storm the capital building, and the government couldn’t even protect themselves, YET they want to confiscate guns and they will “protect” us. No thanks. I will be in charge of protecting myself because clearly you can’t rely on an outside source. 

One other thing... MASKS AREN’T A PARTISAN ISSUE. I’d rather have one and not need it, than need it and not have it just like my Glock :-)

I was before but as I get older I realize how reckless I was. I made 6 figures during the green rush so I'm glad I did but... yeah.. those big balls of mine are gone now haha

If there’s an article on it you’re already too late fucking retard get your small cap bullshit out of here
Sadly, I am not. I even attempted to explain to him by using Berkshire Hathaway A as an exemple, but pretty sure he will just buy back tesla now in hope they catch to Berkshire Hathaway. (Also he didn't know who Warren Buffet was)
Yeah I’m definitely talking to professionals before making any major moves. I don’t plan on borrowing anymore than 25% of my total portfolio tho

So when do you guys think Tesla bubble gonna pop?
Do people expect Tesla to take over the world?  
But why would Europe, Japan and China not form their own protectionism version of subsidized joint force EV company, "Airbus" style?
Before this he had trouble getting approved for a $200k mortgage. So he’s prolly living like a wanker.
Prayer circle , same lol
If he bought a single contract for 300 and its worth 103k then well yeah he doesn't have any realized gains. But he commented elsewhere in the thread that he traded his way up to 100k so he definitely owes something on 2020 gains. OP also said he's not from the US so everything i said goes out the window as i don't know tax laws for any other country. I would still heavily encourage OP to figure out what he owes for these gains and to take it off the table
F
Yeah I don’t think this is too bearish tbh. Either pilot error or not keeping up on maintenance. Doubt the 737500 is defective all the sudden. More likely it’s rinky dink airlines trying to cut corners.
# **when**
Not if you calculate the cash needed for the each put. I calculated based on cash tied up versus premium generated.  2 contracts of Tesla ties up mucho dinero. 

I’m not saying it’s a bad play. I just like finding better ones if I can.
as bearish as i am on tesla as well as the chinese ev companies, i don't suggest selling calls (neither naked, nor covered) on stocks that look to be in a parabolic move, you are taking limited upside, all the downside, and this things will very likely move big in either direction, i wouldn't argue against buying the stock, shorting the stock, buying a put, buying a call, but selling options (even covered ones), just doesn't seem right at this spot
options near the all time highs like a true retard..

i might assign one and start selling a covered call. currently i am selling covered calls on Att to help pay off my att calls and att internet.

So how did NIO day go? Can someone tldr me?
I think you should talk to a tax adviser immediately rather than listen to anyone here on Reddit. You’re sitting on too much money. This can all go to shit very quickly if you make the wrong move.

Same. I pinched every penny possible & just threw it all at tesla when I had the chance. It wasn’t a whole lot, but its been enough to change my life. Gotta be a good person and stay positive.
Considering investment markets flush with cash, wouldn't raising capital gains taxes be a fiscally smart thing to do as long as interest rates cup the balls of 0%?

NIO DAY !!! That was amazing.

I think you’re really speaking in hyperbole a little. I don’t work for Elon directly... but many of the people I work with do. Yes, it’s obviously true he has very high expectations but to act like he goes around firing anyone who slightly disagrees with his is outrageous. That’s just disrespectful to Gwynne, Mark, or the like who I can guarantee you, do not agree with him on everything. 

As for the job, all I can tell you is that I have been a cadet at West Point, a professional baseball player and coach for MLB, and worked for some large tech companies, and this is by far the happiest and most proud I have been in any of the jobs that I have had. Yes the work is hard. Yes it’s a lot of time. But we all joined because we believe in the mission, and to be honest, it’s a thrill. It’s not for everyone but I have been incredibly happy.

It wasn’t too long ago that I legit didn’t have $200 saved up and was living day to day. When I started being honest as much as possible, keeping a positive outlook on life, and prioritized helping others without looking for anything in return, almost magically everything in my life lined up for me.
Great thing is that I'm sure Elon loves seeing these
> However anyone with half a brain knows...

No they don't, because there are enough companies you could also say 'anyone with half a brain knows' bla bla that are not up. Like Intel.

And it's just revisionist history. Might as well have been another company that came out ahead.
First rule of time travel is.

Until it isn’t.
Some of what you said earlier gave me some pause. That's more clear, but now I'm reading what I already know -mostly, I'm not clear on the repo market stuff. Is there any reading you recommend? 

Yeah, if China sells their US debt to whomever, the fed will have to do something about the new rates. I think the keystone of this whole conversation is the concept of 'risk free rate', I never see it discussed in WSB, but we all know should it change suddenly there will be major damage. 

With QE, now the fed is squashing risk premium too in order to get money moving again. Now expected earnings are discounted with these squashed rates, it no wonder why the money is flowing into Tesla and big tech.
You still don’t get it lmao their evaluation is only going to continue up. They will be selling 1 million cars a year and that software revenue will just growwww

Yeah 50% retracement area is an important area. Buyers will come out to either to defend or reaccumulate. Algos are also programed with this area.

He ran a real estate business where chads would go work for in the 80s. These are the types of guys that would have a house in Long Island and a nice wife to take care of it. After work these guys would leave trump offices to pick up some tranny hookers fall in love and put them up in an apartment so long as the tranny never goes through with the surgery. The guy would go back to his wife after a long day of work. He would grow increasingly irritable, he hated his wife and his children. He could only think about the tranny day in and day out. He’s rush over to his tranny’s apartment and one day the tranny reveals to them, they got the surgery. They can now be a real woman, disgruntled the guys beats her leaves and decides to go home. He walks in on his wife banging the pool boy or something or another.

I doubt it bc it went up to 30 yesterday and tanked down the rest of the day, it just went up like that bc it was getting short squeezed and the short volume on Friday was 60% and it almost finished red yesterday, Monday will probably be a big sell off of people holding over the weekend to sell at open to lock in their profits

God its good to be back to Murica hours. The whole night was Nio shilling to the extreme.
The downside risk seems way larger than the upside. Maybe tesla doubles, which would be great for longs, but maybe it nosedives and people turn 700% gains into 100%.

The amount of upside people have, hundreds of %, at this point doesn't justify holding for, maybe, another 100% gain.
So my prediction is a miss .. I won’t see 35 Monday ?
Awesome job

Ayyyy another EU Degiro tard in here, I see you likely sold some TSLA stock to put into that Vanguard ETF? Smart choice, I'm glad it's going well for you.

 I'm from Belgium and I use BUX Zero for everything that is available there (TSLA, NIO, BABA,...) and all the other stuff at Degiro (PLTR, MP, LGVW,...). Put in 8.1k total, i'm around 9.5k now in a month or so. Are you going to hold the rest of your TSLA forever or sell in the near future because of the bubble talks?
Sure. A tech company, in the same way Allianz, Domino's or 3M are tech companies: they needed to adapt and have gone through a digital transformation.

Marvelous.

And hiring from Apple proves exactly that! Apple is mainly an electronics company with good UX.

None of those companies have contributed anything revolutionary in terms of software in the last twenty years. They have not pushed the boundary in this field at all. If you want good software engineers, go to Google, Red Hat, Elastic, Akamai, Shopify, SAP, Adobe or Salesforce, Palantir, or maybe even Facebook, but good luck getting those guys out. Potentially tier one breakout unicorns like bolt, airtable, fastly, tiktok, database companies, or edge companies amongst others.

Not apple. There I would headhunt if I want marketing or design.

What you need to understand is how difficult it is to build fully self driving cars, suitable for robo cabs.

The best self driving car makers are:

Waymo (Google)

GM

Argo.ai (autonomous intelligent driving), part of VW.

Those are the companies leading in every conceivable metric in this field.

Yikes. RIP.
I obviously don’t know your parents but it looks like your just humble bragging or fishing for compliments...which you should get lol good job; great investment. Otherwise, why would it be hard to tell them about your successful trade.

Most don’t realize the reason people never see returns like this is because they take profits too early and don’t give things time to play out. Like Wayfair, OSTK (before its pullback after hitting $130), CVNA, PLUG, TWLO, RH, PLAY, many many more. That also doesn’t mean you should be ignorant to protecting your investment with tools such as stop losses.
For those of you who have no position in NIO like myself, how are you doing? I knew I would miss out, but the Baba shit scared me of all Chinese companies. I’m such a retard

Passes the buck and finds scapegoats for shit that goes poorly. Anyone who doesn’t like it quits. How long have you worked there? Are you putting in 80 hr weeks? Do you get treated like a person? What’s your salary? From what I’ve heard he treats employees like shit, is that true?

Obviously he’s a smart dude, much smarter than me. But the rich person worship has got to stop.

Palantir is not a pump and dump. It sure got pumped 2 months after the direct public listing, but it's a long term play. Hold it for 6 months at least and you'll see. After Feb lockout ends we will start to hike up. Ignore the mongoloids who are bearish because they keep buying weeklies on Palantir, even though it's been extensively explained that this is a long term play.

I don’t necessarily disagree with you but I think we see a dramatic change in Twitter over the next 18months. I believe the entrenched board supporting Jack will be broken up and the new board will soon be closing in on him. They are moving from a staggered board to a de-staggered board. Every director will be voted on annually rather than every three years. Also, Activist hedge fund Elliot’s agreement to limit/not buy more shares expires before the next annual meeting.

Whats a realistic PT till june
The Chinese people have a strong national and racial pride. While Americans graduating from the Frankfurt colleges are conditioned to hate America and themselves. The next century will be dominated by China since they’re more like Americans from the 40s and 50s working towards a common goal as a homogeneous society. Damn, I wish I was a young Chinaman right now.
Exactly! This is why I’m being so risky.
Lol, they actually do have way better numbers:

If it goes down no one else is going to care that you lost a mil except you lol.
take his account value, subtract the daily gain, and then check that number to the account value.   That is a gain of 17.7%,   not 9%.

Wild how that was an actual stolen election. Fucking Florida court just snatched it from Gore when he won the recount. Magatards crying fraud when Trump loses by 8 million votes lol

2 things have to happen still. First, it has to sustain this price. Second, you have to be skilled enough to exit the trade at a gain. Be smart.

Yes we have enough. But until a lithium farm is able to produce it needs 3-5 years i read. Correct me if i‘m wrong. I’m sure until around 2030  there wont be enough and production won‘t reach demand. But maybe i‘m completely wrong and the will find a new way to produce hydrogen with much less energy and it‘s the new shit. The thing is everything changes in seconds. What‘s wrong today could be right tomorrow.
Seriously the moment TSLA drops 20% people will buy the absolute shit out of it. I'll be holding mine just because my average is around 160

No matter what happens with COVID-19 in 2021, cloud spending isn't expected to slow. That makes cloud-based customer relationship management (CRM) software provider **salesforce.com** ([NYSE:CRM](https://www.fool.com/quote/nyse/salesforcecom-inc/crm/)) a solid bet to outperform with Biden in the White House.

In simple terms, CRM software helps businesses track customer information, log service issues, and manage their marketing campaigns. Although retail is the most logical beneficiary of CRM solutions, it's by no means the end-all. Manufacturing, healthcare, information technology, and service industries all benefit from real-time customer data to better serve their existing clients and make add-on sales.

In terms of CRM software, [salesforce is the kingpin](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/28/got-1000-3-stocks-to-buy-to-start-2021-with-a-bang/). **Gartner** estimated that it controlled 18.3% of the global CRM market at the end of 2019. That's more than double its next-closest competitor. With the addition of **Slack Technologies**, which salesforce has [agreed to acquire for $27.7 billion in cash and stock](https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/01/salesforce-building-the-operating-system-for-the-f/), salesforce will have another way to cross-sell its products on a rapidly growing business-based platform.

Considering that most [software-as-a-service (SaaS) stocks](https://www.fool.com/investing/stock-market/market-sectors/information-technology/saas-stocks/) are valued at 20 or more times sales, salesforce looks like an absolute bargain at less than 10 times fiscal 2021 sales.

Technical analysis: Head and shoulders pattern, bullish signal

Position: 230C March 19th expiry
I own about 6k worth of salesforce, but WCLD is better for betting on cloud, which is why I have 1300 shares.
to be honest thats why i did ... maybe get lucky ahead of wsb for once...

and i still have my tsla calls so theres that lol

You don't have any money yet, idiot. What you have is a computer screen telling you that if you click the right buttons on your computer, you can have $1.9m

But you won't do it. So Monday close it could be $2m or it could be 250k. But you won't know until you sell.

WSB is great banter and all, but it is shocking to me how retarded some of you are.

And, it is impossible to argue with a retard who thinks he is a genius because he has a big number on his screen, thinking he is a millionaire.

This is why conventional wisdom is never short a bubble.
Filipinos don't seem to have problem with their aircraft. When I first went to the Philippines, that other Indonesian flight on a airbus crashed into the sea the day after I got there. Which was spooky because I had taken the same type of airplane with the Philippine Airlines. Apparently the plane just turned and dived right into the sea. It hits hard when you have that memory of freshly being on an airplane
When is the ipo??? I’m desperate to throw money at it
I did that months ago
You literally bought the top. You really don’t think it’ll dip below 800 ever again?
OK, now you switch to what she used to say to him, OK we’re working here we’re working
So it’s okay if the presi calls for death of senators and stage a coup but we can’t comment on such actions? Sweet.
Mind telling me why you think so? I totally believe that tesla won‘t be an EV monopoly so NIO is definitely gonna be big in the coming years but I want 1000% gains today 😤
  Very smart
All the gay bears at r/realtesla keep talking about a bubble. I think they’re just fucking stupid

Sometimes id rather lose lol
Yeah it’ll most likely dip but will shoot back up. Short term puts. Buy calls on the dip.
I realized that somewhere along the way, yes

And they still keep coming back for more, almost as if bears love getting fucked.
Dude on CNBC said TSLA could triple still. Many bears will die along the way
Don't, they will come with massive EV news this year.

He was referring to a messaging app, which is not a public company.
How do you come up with 600k% gain?
Thats not even possible with the ipo price of 3.40 cents a share. Split adjusted
Its basically asking yourself if you want to more than double your account in 6 months or not
And why is there a random quotation mark at the end of all this? Lol
Your condescending and false sense of morale superiority is fucking hilarious. Someone mod this guy

Thursday it went from 20 to 30 and did the same Friday I sold Thursday then bought at a lower price but failed to sell at 30 as previous 🤷🏾‍♂️ I’ll be alright ...
I am hearing about price in logic since Tesla was 300. 2030 growth was priced in at 300.

I love RKT. it's the cornerstone of my theta gang account.
LOL im trying to keep the guy from making a life changing mistake and you're encouraging him to keep putting it all on black. Making sure you have enough to cover your taxes owed isnt a 15$/hour mentality, thats how rich people think. They put away money in a separate account to make sure they don't end up owing anything the next year and pretend the money doesn't exist. I reiterate my statement, you're a complete fucking idiot.
Well yea that’s their flaw for us Europoors. Besides all of their current cars are larger than the average car in Europe making it harder to use on our roads

Trading based on fantasies sounds smart.
Exactly. His position was worth 11 million.  He could go dividends and bonds with 5, pay the tax man 3ish, and leave 2 million to Elon all while living a VERY comfortable lifestyle.

Not a huge difference in quality of life between that and doing the same with 30 mill.

But if he's the kind of guy to diamond hand to 11 million, he's the kind of guy to think it'll only go up even more.

How long can he hold his hand down on the frying pan before pulling back?  I don't think he has the stomach to be a TSLA bear. Those bears would lose billions month after month and would go on national tv grinning like idiots, telling everyone outlandish stories about tesla making up car sales and fraudulent accounting.  This guy experiences one week of the Tesla bear experience and he is already crying himself to sleep at night.

NVIDIA has still been on a tear this year. Yeah, their gains are no match for tesla, square, roku or crispr, but doubling in value amid a pandemic is still good. And nvidia is actually likely to hold their current valuation tbh

Nah you good. Sell the Tesla when you think you made enough on the premium. 

The spy is good too.

AAPL I would buy out further but you have a chance.
Model 3 is cost competitive for what it is. In the next 5 years the mass market EVs will start to show up and margins will collapse. Unless people will be willing to pay a premium for a Tesla when there are cheaper alternatives that don't suck.
[deleted]
Yeah can’t miss out! On that note, did you see we’ve now got a melon award?! I didn’t think this place could get more retarded but here we are lol
This is the right level of financial literacy for weekly trading options. Otherwise you're overthinking it. Just click that buy button on market open Monday.
Also, for more confirmation bias I see this situation almost like that of amd in the late 2017 and 2018. I was building a pc at the time, so I got pretty into anything computer related and from there I heard how amd was slowly getting better. So when amd started spiking in price, I was not surprised at all due to what the computer community was saying. Look into what the gaming community is saying regarding console supplies and the situation should not surprise you.

Oh my, shares, how daring of you.
Yah sorry I’ve had that 7k in my head for a long time and always type it to instinctually.

Haven’t seen any of these until just now but I agree. Coincidentally I just had to unfollow a couple nhl news accounts on ig because they kept spamming that same shit
Finally freed from those shackles yesterday thanks to daddy spacman
Icln duh
Yeah, percentage of people who can afford might be low, but the number will be high due to the high population. Plus I think they are making the decision to make this high level expensive car because they want to differentiate from Tesla Model 3.
Exactly. I have been hearing the same shit since it hit $70 lol. I had a financial advisor laugh at me when it was at 70 and recommended Boeing and some other dumb shit
TSLA is fuk.... hehehe

TSLA is extremely popular in China, and is consumers’ first choice when it comes to buy EV cars. Chinese people idolize Elon a lot just like us. Plus Chinese EV is a huge market and there will be plenty of room for both

TSLA 1000 next week. 

NIO 80 next week.
I sold 10 1/8 800c for $2.25 a contract on Wednesday for a slight loss... they closed at $80 a contract on Friday.
I’m not saying anything bad about the company. My only argument is that saying “$75 is cheap” is an ignorant statement and makes you sound naive
You should sell some of it and diversify your investment little bit. World is full of uncertainties. Tesla may continue its onward journey but external market factors may not always be favorable.
Watermelon.... does that mean liquidate Elon?!?!

The TSLA super cycle is about every 6-8 weeks.  Goes parabolic, everyone falls in love.  Then consolidates for like 2 months and during that time retards in here start to denounce it, and that’s when you buy calls because it’s then you know you’re only 3 weeks or so from it going parabolic again.

There are no catalysts which drive the price action, it’s completely unexplainable.
Dude quit being a scaredy cat. He is at like 10 percent completion of his life goals. EVERYONE. You are scared that TSLA is mooning and want to short it but you forgot it's GOING TO MARS.

If SpaceX went IPO, they would trade like RKT. Contrary to what you guys think, IPOs can be overhyped
That would be....~$3.6T valuation. Fuck it, why not at this point.

TSLA obv. Tesla will cross $1000 this year. Sure there might be a short term pullback but leaps are for the long term. Who cares if it pulls back? As long as it goes up/is worth more than it is today in half a year, which I am 100% sure it will
Alright child time for a history lesson.

During the dot com bubble amazon grew to about 50x its IPO price. At the same time the bubble burst and companies like Pets.com which amazon was invested in, shit the bed.

However anyone with half a brain knows, even though amazon fell 90% during the bubble, If you have some balls and held your $1000 investment at the peak of the bubble, it would be $15000 today.

And a regular person would just avg down a shit ton during the burst.

You're a fucking moron. Can you not even play with the idea he might make a single mistake? The music stops playing for everyone eventually, and continuing to put all of your money into new positions is a good way to lose everything. He can't pay taxes if he loses all the money in his account and has nothing to pay with. 20k is a lot of fucking money to a lot of fucking people, and would cripple a most people if they suddenly find themselves owing that much with no way to pay. 

A decades long passive index fund investors knows what they're doing more than you do. Just because OP is an "active trader" doesn't mean it'll be a smooth ride and doesn't mean he cant lose it before the piper come calling. Only the piper is the IRS with the full backing of the US government and OP might go to fucking JAIL if he has no way to pay them back. God youre a fucking idiot

Context is completely different given the COVID data today vs summer 2020, and I’m pretty sure people were saying “maybe mass protests aren’t such an great idea right now” back then. But I’m more talking about the deflection tactic of “well what about...” that people use when faced with criticism than the point about COVID.

I would not be surprised if console sales are lower than expected. Don't get me wrong, this wave of console demand is extraordinary. But, if you've been following anything gaming related, consoles supply have been bottleneck by production problems. They are not making them fast enough. Instead of a huge sale spike one quarter, it's more like a big spike over two quarters. This is still nothing to worry about because the consoles demand if definitely there.

The evidence has been heard in court, and Trumps elite strike team had plenty of time to show it to you. It was thrown out of court repeatedly by Trump appointed judges. They refused to show the evidence when asked by Fox News repeatedly. Apparently this was a preliminary stage and the evidence would be produced in due course. Still waiting. During the call with Brad Raffensperger the president said that in his “opinion” it was rigged and he “feels” it was stolen from him. If at this late stage all he has is feelings and opinions I’m guessing no evidence exists.
TSLA is not a car company, or a company. It's a new way of storing value to avoid inflation.

Guys i have a secret. Im Q. Im also a dishwasher at the Wendys next to Langley.
yeah just set the strike at a 'safe' price ... just have to gauge the price movement and factor in ER / PR all that shit.  I just did it with small caps to see how it works and how I can work with it. so say a stock was currently $7, I'd just set the strike at $10 and take the $60 or so premium because I wouldn't mind losing the shares for $1000+ anyways. then sometimes I'd wait til a run up in price before selling a call against it because the premiums go way up, and after a news sell off the price will go back down then you can just close the option out for a profit. mentally I just always told myself to not get too attached to a stock anyways because there can always be others to play
Wouldn’t the Musk Melon emoji be more appropriate 🍈🍈🍈
I have small capital so enough to cover all of my losses if my account were to blow up. I have 35 0.06 cost average 41 calls right now and if we see a scary vix spike I'll make more than I lose. Rest of it is calls or CSPs

You need to realize there are graduations of drawdowns. You’re talking about a hedge for downturns. I’m talking about catastrophe insurance. Why do you think hedge fund managers buy swaps? 99% of the time they don’t pay out, and the 1% they do, they pull the fund’s ass out of the fire. It’s what you do when vol is elevated: you hedge against corporate credit.

Yeah could be safe. But leaps won’t pay very well if it’s just a hedge against a bubble burst. It’ll pay nicely if it’s twitter’s demise. Let’s find out. TO THE UNDERGROUND VALHALLA WE GO!

I work in PWM, and I might caution you on this....I’m not sure who you’re borrowing from (and no way you’re locking in 2.5% over the long term unless rates stay rock bottom), but...you will probably be limited to borrowing 50% of the value of your Tesla shares (if not less because it is so volatile). And what happens if Tesla takes a dip, even if only temporarily? Your bank will likely want you to pay up because your loan will no longer be collateralized. I am just saying it is not as simple as you’re making it out to be, and you could very well end up screwing yourself over.

Always has been.... from a few years ago.
Land in Hawaii has a finite limit, and has extreme demand. The stonk market also has extreme demand, but no finite limit. Land is also far less liquid than stocks. You can take profits with the click of a button. There are no algos out there buying and selling plots of land in Hawaii millions of times per day. For the algos to keep making money, they need it to drop, so they can keep flipping it, and stealing all our money.
And the crash might lead tesla mostly unaffected. Seeing how they optimize their production and cut costs, and margins, leading to competitor after competitor going bankrupt, the large old ICE companies too, could also happen to some extent.

Also wasnt that $7000 presplit or have i missed her saying that postsplit? I.e. Another 9x increase to come in 3 years time?
You dont think shes actively selling here?
Someone mentioned Rimworld. Shits pretty good. Epic store has crying sun for free right. NOw which is really.good

He said 3 weeks, whatever he ended up selling at a gain before new years is going to be taxed. Its definitely not all of his gains, but i would hate to see fellow retards be in debt to the IRS when they were up to bigly before. If he didnt sell anything in 2020 then you're right and he doesnt need to worry until april next year
Yeah. I’m sure Bangladesh and China have better numbers then US.... also infections are going up in Europe where they supposedly did everything right.

Depends the strike price. I’d see how Monday goes if it’s seems positive it’ll probably be all week from people FOMOing.
It's pile on time as fund managers, retail, sovereign wealth, etc all see a pretty clear runway upward for 2021.

Are they right? They can *make* it right. But there's likely to be extreme volatility. Anyone jumping on Tesla right now knows, somewhere in their mind, that the chart makes no sense. no one wants to be on the other side of the mountain (well, shorts do) so enough weakness could cause a landslide of selling.
Hang out, work out, check stuff off to do list, drink some beers, talk shit on WSB, sleep

If you only have 30 years to live, what would you YOLO on?
correct, and many people believe that is the case.  according to them, “random” events are simply events that we can not understand with the information we currently have.  i didn’t explain that well, and i don’t necessarily agree with them but i get their point.
Bills are gonna stop Indy. Like 35-14
They’ll definitely cover the six
Think about the world Trumpers live in though. A stolen election, with judges bribed to throw out cases or coerced by a behind the scenes deep state government. If I believed those things were true, I would seek remediation too. To them, their freedom is being lost, because they believe the world conspires to silence their vote.
haha relax. The video does NOT recommend to short tesla
PLTR isn't going spectacularly implode anytime soon, so I am hanging on to that one long-term. GME is one to keep a close eye on, not sure where that one is going yet due to all the fuckery happing with it.
Realistically, How much higher than tree fitty is Nio gonna go on monday ?

Is this about the Indonesia airline?
So while I agree with your points of them censoring is bad business. 

I also know people are vain, stupid, lazy with short term memories. Sure a lot may leave the platform while they announce their departure like it’s an airport being the attention whores they are. 

But after a while they’ll start to get bored, they’ll miss the attention, they’ll miss their proverbial fix for scrolling whatever social platform they got hooked on and they’ll be back. 

Now I’m not saying everyone who leaves will be back but a large portion of them will yearn to be an attention whore again needing validation for their stupid opinions. 

Sure it’s bad for business in most business models to piss off your customer/user base 

But that’s only valid when people aren’t addicted to your product. 

Good luck on your hedge though I hope you smash a solid 20+ bagger

I fear that you and I are going to miss out on one of the short term huge drops which will happen Monday pre-market. But for you, I will officially shut down my account and stop looking at Twitter from this point forward. Forreal the only time I actually used it anyway was to look at Trump’s latest tweet. So it’s pointless now anyway. 

But yeah I agree and will be doing the same. Twitter is turning into commie garbage.
calls on this DD
No, I’m not talking about a bearish bet, I’m talking about a hedged position(yolo puts is not a hedged position, that’s called being retarded). If you aren’t consistently hedging your position you are setting yourself up for failure(especially in options). Whenever most stock start dropping their IV goes up. I also like picking up hedges based on rho(bond yields have been fluctuating) if I am buying similar positions at the same time.

What? It’s a valid question. I thought when the stock price goes down ours increase in value and the same for calls but opposite.

With you on this!  Got stopped out on friday, so hopefully that was a sign of monday and i can get back in a little lower.  Bought more GME on friday as well, price seems to have good support at 17.50.
NIO $85 end of week, you heard it here first 🚀

I still think PLTR has a chance, but MM's were salty that the didn't get cheap shares through an IPO. Now's their chance with the lock up and they want to keep the price as low as possible.
You mean on Monday? 🚀🚀🚀
So NIO day was pretty damn underwhelming no? I don’t see how anything that was presented could threaten Tesla or Apple’s upcoming car with Hyundai.
My guess: Tesla will get obliterated next week, and when all tsla millionares will see a 10 percent drop, it’s selling time. 

But I’m never betting against papa. So we’ll just see I guess

Biden wont pursue charges in the name of national unity and out of fear of riling up the crazies.

The whole movement will just fade away as these morons move on to the next conman (likely Tucker) and continue to die deaths of despair.
you could sell covered calls in the meantime

How detached can the price of an etf be from the assets it holds? For eg retail start buying ARK etfs at market price, but that money is going to previous holders instead of the fund managers, so how do they make sure the price stays attached to assets

I too want to see you keep your gains. Just a thought, I know you like Elon but now that he’s made you rich, why not split that wealth across a handful of companies that you love? That way you at least have protection against a nightmare scenario where tsla stock loses a lot of value for any shitty reason thats out of your control.

I'd say that it probably will go up or down
Government in the United States is incompetent because the republican party guts the fuck out of government doing shit, except for the military. They fucking love paying that shit. 

Other countries are able to have a nationalized healthcare system and benefit from it. Meanwhile, in the United States, you got people going with tens of thousands of dollars in bills even if they got cancer, and other smaller surgeries or even diagnostics are ridiculously expensive. 

Government is inefficient because the republicans force it and want you to think that way.

This is a really bad idea. You are making a financial decision based on and fueled by emotions.


There are way safer plays and way easier plays. 

I think you overestimate who gives a shit about twitter or the ban. Fox News and other MSM networks might harp on about it but no one actually watches cable anymore (look at the numbers) and those who do certainly don't use twitter.

Twitter has had 4 years to analyze and contemplate this decision and it has probably been scrutinized for countless hours by financial advisors who know the pros and cons way more than you or me. 


TLDR : Twitter is fucking cancer but historically stocks only go up. Way easier and safer plays out there.
Get out of here with that. People were flying from BLM protests and no one cared.

I don't disagree with that notion either. I think it only bothers people that these platforms consistently censor the right when they break rules and consistently let it slide from the left.

You’re talking about making a bearish bet. I’m taking about an insurance policy. Granted retail investors can’t buy swaps, but OTM puts on corporate credit are the next best thing for Armageddon. And you are incorrect, OTM puts on LQD would have paid off much more, *because* it’s so stable. When a low IV security becomes volatile, put premiums skyrocket. 

I am bullish. Always have been, always will be. There are two schools of thought: leverage all your money and hedge, or keep a cushion for when the shit hits the fan. I opt for the cushion, but the hedged position is a valid choice too, which is what I’m describing.

Why would such plans not be public? It's a publicly traded companies. And Thiel knows everything there is to know about large companies, as he had founded some, and a chairman and the first investor in Facebook. He knows how those things work from the inside.

Eric had no response whatsoever and pretty much led Thiels comments stand.

And the reason Thiel was "hostile" is because he thinks that it's more important to press people like Eric than to massage their egos.

Yep. They’re all thinking they’re slick as fuck. People have been saying that since before the split. Ride it to the moon or sit on the sides and enjoy your fomo, cause these rockets are fueled and going.
Cathie 'pink panties' Ark said she thinks it will get to 6000 which i believe was pre split so its fucking going to $1500. I think its gonna take some consolidation for a large move above $1000 but who knows it might be there EOW

My personal take from this: they said they want to market towards retail investors. The top is near. When companies want to go private that means the stock is cheap. When they want to go public that means valuations are likely overpriced. “Marketing towards retail investors” is my biggest worry about the etf.

Not 🌈 🐻, but I personally think FB is better hedge if you want to buy puts. They get wide variety of hate both from users and legislators on every corner of the earth. Companies that have their own ecosystem (such as apple) are making their data mining extremely hard. Compared to any other FANG companies they haven’t come up with anything innovative for years now and it will also be extremely hard for them to acquire competitor/innovative company. Their main revenue model is too dependent on advertising. It’s a matter of time until they will epically shit their bed.
I honestly feel their design is kinda bland too. If imma spend that money at least give me a few more sexy curves in my car
Congrats those are some nice gains

I doubt it. Democratic party and media are held to a higher standard of truth. Lies and twists can still spread, but republican party and right wing media can lie and twist a lot more without pushback from the right. 

They would definitely pick and prod at every little tiny mistake all day (which would be annoying, but it makes media money so they will do it), but I believe most people would appreciate Trump going ahead with what the experts recommended all the way through, and pushing other republicans and democrats to do the same. Researchers and scientists would likely back Trump's actions as well. Only the fringe portion of weird people on twitter would say Trump is doing everything bad even if he did the right thing.

I’m British and tbh, I’d say the vast majority of people here can’t afford a base model 3 let alone an S or an X. The VW ID3 will sell better and the Leaf is the best selling EV in the country. NIO also has plans for EU expansion and are apparently hiring in Norway (from another Reddit comment, haven’t checked this) so if they can undercut Tesla, then they’ll sell better.
Holy retarded Jesus. Fuck you and grab on to Tesla by the balls you beautifully retarded SOB.

Look here you fucking retard. This is how you are spoken to when people are trying to take every penny you have but also taking their time to tell you you're dumb and go home.

You buy low, sell high. That means on green days you sell puts, on red days you buy calls. LMFAO went from $70 to .70c over 5 years. On friday it popped from 70 cents to 3 dollars+ after hours. All because they released new they were making a spac and lmfa went through the fucking roof, blatant pump and dump. I still rode it since it was 5 min gainers.. I dumped it before AF, 10% gain in 1 hour. I shot up double my price for selling....

&#x200B;

I watched as apdn shot up on fda approval for covid uk variant test. bought. 100 shares and took a shit in AH...

&#x200B;

I sold BB 7.5 calls 1/8s i had bought on 1/7 i had 2 other strikes for 1/15 sold them for break even because the brokerage they were in is shit and I was afraid they would go to 0 before the day was out (midday shakes)

&#x200B;

$300 is enough to get a taste, buy 10 quantity 30 cent options of some of the big tickers in here with a strike price of 2 weeks or more out... sell as soon as you are scared, you wont make any money until you put the phone down and give it a few hours. holding overnight costs theta, theta runs perpetually at various rates based upon purchasing of the options.... its very complicated, you either buy out of the money at a high strike on a volatile stock, or you buy stocks and have patience.

&#x200B;

The guys that do well here are just the rarity of the ones who are losing money.
Yes. I think TLRY goes up for sure also, I just like CGC better bc of the additional investment (along w increased control over the company) by STZ.

My hope is that CGC does something to make moves as a response to TLRY making moves, and so on and so on, until the entire weed sector goes to the f*ckin moon 🚀

With a strike price that high the only way they could print is selling on a super green Monday.
Why are you geh?
So the value of money is derived from the value of the country... If that makes sense? America's rise to power was because of our gold reserves and ability to pay our debts (Thanks to our shady sideline actions in the World Wars). So our currency is valuable because our country is valuable. We don't default, we import not export (Good for the currency, strong imports weak exports supports a strong dollar) and this is just naming two reasons. The value of fiat currency is based on the intrinsic value of the country. I value is what an asset is worth... I'm just subbing out asset and inserting country. You could also slap implied value in there. Fiat currency's value is objective derived from the country which holds it. Debt denominations also impact this, but I don't want to confuse you. 

In short: A fiat currency is worth what the country is. Some of this in based on tangible measures and some is purely psychological speculation. This is the best way I can break that down to you without making a PowerPoint.

2.) No, these securities are assets with a claim on American debt denominated in The pipeline leads back to the Fed and Treasury. The Treasury simply births the bills/debt, the Fed sells and controls them. These securities can and will be paid out. It's why people buy our debt, you pay for the debt and gain more USD at maturity. The USD is modern day gold, so imagine a gold miner investing money in tools for a return. If they liquidate it gets very messy for investors and muddies the water for future investment. I can't really teach you everything in a post online... A sell off is bad because we're targeting low rates. If they dump debt, rates rise (Impact on the Fed), and economic growth stalls. They would be forced to push lots of money into the economy to restart it and then do QE like we've never seen before. The rates would bankrupt most of the country and it would be a shitshow with the Fed is at the helm.

3.) The Fed exchanges cash for assets in OMO (Open Market Operation). This is usually an asset exchange, debt for dollars. This is different than the Fed buying securities from "dealers" (Banks). The Fed pays banks in **reserves**. Basically, the Fed buys the bonds from the banks and says "Here's and IOU". At the date of maturity they actually hand over the cash. That's where is differs from a regular bond. It's why the <1 year T-Bills are so popular (and why the Fed doesn't buy them). The Fed swaps securities for reserves... Not actual dollars. This is different from their purchases of corporate debt, where they actually do give cash. 

Why reserves? The banks know it's there which gives them peace of mind to lend. So the Fed does QE to make banks feel safe and that they can lend. It's not to supply us stimmies (But it does), it's to initiate lending in the US. Debt = Inflation... *Supposedly*.

You have the right ideas when it comes to the bond market... It's just different with the Fed. They usually don't play by our rules.
and then get shot
Just a reminder that NIO is up 4000% in 18 months, compared to TSLA’s 1700%. If Tesla is the pin that pops the EV bubble all of those stocks could tumble bigly. At this point any of the companies could shake something. Even positive a catalyst from NIO that causes TSLA to check itself could kick some dominos into action and break NIO as well.

Petro dollar system is crumbling. Countries are happy to trade with China and Russia in Yuan and Ruble. If Saudi chooses not to play Petro ball by the rules there could be real issues, which is definitely one of the reasons Trump was sucking up to MBS. USD is backed by the military of course but I can definitely see a bearish outlook on dollars for the near term being a reasonable stance.

#NO YOU
Not every EV has to be TSLA or beat TSLA. Just make good EVs and its a good investment. I think too many people are trying to hook the next whale. I will settle for salmon
what do yall do on the weekend?
Im thinking big cargo ships.
Significant acquisitions/mergers that have effects on competition have to obtain approval by regulatory bodies in all the countries where the companies operate
Should be OK. It’s hard to tell whether the market already priced in the new model and upgraded battery pack.
Sounds like a retard because it's inevitably gonna crash
Honestly I think VALE is very similar to this play but just better. They are the largest nickel supplier in the world, which will be huge when EV's become the norm. They also mine iron which is skyrocketing in price. IV is stupid low at like 40% too. Just a thought
still a nice double. But of course in hindsight a bit painful to look at
I'm doing a zoom course for my fellowhsip of the royal college of surgeons exam. It's fucking boring, Puts on zoom.
Oof that can't go tits up.
I’m aware retard.
I’d say gravity but Tesla is on a Spacex rocket ship 🚀🚀🚀
Counterpoint to those saying NIO has larger potential customer base in China vs TSLA that is mainly US/Europe rn: 

Asian markets are very cut-throat in margins and at least in cell phone businesses it’s hard to make large profits off units. 
1.) Bc income there is low
2.) Bc Asian people are not retarded Americans or Europoors who live in debt their entire lives. It’s a culture thing. Debt = bad. 


Yes NIO will have larger customer base, but won’t TSLA have higher margins selling to Euros and Americans? 

Thoughts? 🧠
SoftBank is selling it to NVDA
That's kinda terrible.
Still left the one eye bigger than the other, once you see it you can’t see anything else
Yea but don’t play it with options.  It does not have the requisite big duck energy.  

Long 90 shares 

Not only are they an EV play but they have autonomous driving business upside (their cruise subsidiary)
Getting a little big for your britches
I don’t get people who say they’re never selling. How will you make money if you never sell?
Go check his twitter
Huh?
STONK MARKET PULLED BACK MONDAY 🤡
More like POW pwns amirite
He got shares for free and sold them, don't get confused, but apparently this was all planned in advance
I hope TSLA becomes a value company next week so my puts print and i can buy calls
Gamma squeeze is all over the market. Options are driving stock prices for meme stocks. What’s happening at market right now is that **stocks prices are now a derivative of a derivative of stocks.**
[deleted]
For a little bit. Then back to the moon!
If it makes you feel any better I sold 1 day before it sky rocketed
what if someone say bought their 1/15 calls about 3 months ago and are holding through the event
You could’ve made more money shorting tqqq, qqq, dia, spy, and any other index fund for cheaper and a bigger payout. Just saying... ackman’s playing a different game than you or I, or don’t you know how IB’s and floor traders work? With your play all you’re doing is buying a put position in the event something unlikely happens, while index funds have seasonal events that are predictable.
Sooooo NVDA calls at open?
I missed that. Last I read it was delayed. Looks like it is next week. Probably wait a bit to buy because ipo tend to pump/dump
we demand more!
I would think the economy / currency is all relative compared to how the other countries are doing. 

So as long as we are going Japanification at a slower speed than the other major economic powers, then we’re fine because everyone else is printing.
In terms of valuation, TSLA always trades higher than big bank analyst price targets. so when the analst gave it a 800 PT it had to go up to much higher than 800. So probably 1000 is a fair valuation for it.
That shit was wild bro they spent so long on it
[deleted]
TSLA went up every single day last week, lol. As it should be.
FUBO price targets if 8 and 60 and I just jumped in at 27 and 28. What the actual fuck is with this stock
It's not a gain until you sell it.
This is the way.
Its on a downtrend for over a month now and their plane crashing killing 62 people is a trend reversal point? Fuck me sideways mate.
It's funny how the only value stocks WSB will buy is in the DOW jones
Tony the tiger?
gay
PLTR is so last month
Is it to late to load up shares of riot? It’s up 70% this week but I think it’s got a lot of room to grow
I am a super bull in growth stocks. Tw tr & F b are going to be my hedges.
You’re kinda conflating conservatives with idiots who believe Trump.
Yes hopefully can get in early Monday
I’m not sure if Trump or the establishment republicans will get to keep the “Republican” name, but one of them making a new party wouldn’t shock me
Maybe, just be ready to sell them quickly and don't go all  diamond hands with them
I had & sold ...guess time to buy again
> I’m not seeing anybody, and I plan to have a vasectomy

And nothing of value was lost
I get its a big meme, but if you think Tesla ISN'T in a bubble you should be hospitalized and researched by scientists
yeah exactly. Dems won’t fair well as long as their guided by incompetent 80+ year olds that excite no one. 

But that’s why 🥭 won because he’s not boring

It’ll be even more annoying when it dips Monday and we have to hear about how smart they all were and called it
Isn't it the 13th? Or that was also delayed
APHA right is the better buy because of the share conversion rate, also if the deal doesn’t go thru I’d rather be holding APHA.
So nio calls at open? Got it.
Of course you do
Keep it up, everyone starts somewhere!
why would you do that
and that’s backed up by what? your opinion? personally was laid off in March. Was collecting unemployment and saving it because i was scared as fuck about my future employment prospects and also had nothing to pay for but food and rent. 

But if i had kids? fuck that would suck. i think UBI is an interesting idea that should be discussed. 

All for job programs, how about the green new deal?
Doesn't matter even if its true. Better price point

I’ve already borrowed against this and made more trading options and day trading than my initial investment

Nah weekend threads are always maximum
Damn jane is fine
Agreed. You have to be a skeptic. I just believe in the business. They have the potential to be that unique brand similar to TSLA. Not saying they will rival TSLA, just that they have that brand loyalty aspect. They already have 10k reservations for their Fisker Ocean SUV that comes out late next year. They partnered with Magna for the production as well as the development for autonomous driving tech.
yeah seriously, stock is incredibly beaten down too and company is too big to fail, its not gonna plummet
[deleted]
What are you confused about? You’re asking if there’s going to be a correction by 2023? Of course there will be that’s an eternity away, I’m countering that, by saying there will be a correction by March 23, it’s a joke because I’m using the 23, get it kid?
tbf those planes don't have nearly the kind of mileage that indonesian commercial jet did.
Yes, check your robinhood messages they explain why

Affirm was delayed iirc. I like that one because of their walmart intergration.
Give him some time
I didn't listen to you, but I think I should have.
😞
 I wasn't defending them?
I think Gary Black is right. Last week, the majority of buying in TSLA was done by the 1T in active funds benchmarked to S&P that were underweight going into the qt. They bought out of fear of losing their jobs.
I just spend excessive time here in the daily discussions. it'll come up if it is happenening soon
🤡
you dont own enough tsla
I wouldn’t borrow against it if I didn’t have other means to pay it back even if it went down to 0
Idk enough to understand what your example signifies
Good question.  Depends if you have other assets that are easily liquid and plentiful should stocks go tits up in the short term like the gay bears keep saying.  Gov will get their taxes in the end, but its only on realized gains(currently) and if you have held more than a year, then those taxes are less ( this is where i would say talk to a CPA since all taxes are personal ).  In general, should always "ring the register" on gains, even if its just the initial investment sum(playing with the house money, like gamblers do ).  But then again, its TSLA...

Of course it will crash some day. Even the biggest retards in here know this. But we also want to make our tendies while possible. That most of us will get fucked as soon as the crash comes is going to be the biggest loss porn week ever on here lol.

Then who are you giving them up to as a libertarian?
IV crush bruh, you better hope we skip the 60s
I got an email about this from the this am. Half read it and didn't follow.. check your inbox
Alternative perspective, I bought a call once. It was Tsla. Battery day. I’ll let you guess the rest
They should just get rid of all state leaders by default. It’s either edgy and toxic, propaganda or shallow generic messages. 

They also just should have banned Trump until further or until inauguration instead of reinstating him after 12 hours just to ban him again. No one would have bat an eye and it would have been non news.
Wait hes so fucking gross but she's hot. This makes no sense
Europe doesn’t own Fitbit yet they also have to approve google acquisition. (That’s jsit first example that comes to mind)
If you borrow against the position and it does not sustain it would be as if you took out a regular loan. The collateral just qualifies. 

If it goes up you would either need to pay it back with other cash since "never sell" or liquidate position anyway and eventually pay cap gains at whatever % it is in future.

1: one directional risk being tsla goes up you win, down you lose and actually owe the money back if it goes down. 
2: if you invested this in a fixed income position at 1.9 million you would generate 50,000 a year forever in bond market for free. You could sell a very long term almost 100% itm call to extract the cash. Wont be realized until years out and then the fixed income would hedge against gains. Youd have cap gains tax and a few hundred k to toss at taxes.

With that said hope you're right and gluck on the loan.
NIO going to 75 before it goes back down to 40
Wow! It took nearly 4 weeks to identify the problem? You do realize that they’ve had 4 powered flights and only 2 have EVER been successful. That’s in 16 years of operations.

Also, Chamath damping 38% of his PERSONAL stake two days after the failed flight was NOT a good sign.
Me too!!! 🤍✨

This makes my day to finally hear someone who knows what they’re talking about. I just wanted to add that the new virus variant can be defeated by the existing vaccines. That’s great news for returning to normalcy, i.e. travel
Yeah its likely That there will be a correction this year the Wohle market is Kind of overpriced and as graham told us the higher it goes the harder it falls just look at the setback in 1970
Let me ask you, who owns ARM?
Dude! Great fucking saying. I’m going to 100% steal this and pretend I made it up.
Correct. Blind optimism. Tesla does have a wide range of products and enough cash on hand to promote but the 10000 gorilla is the lack of consumer demand and credit long term for their expensive products

I have a friend who went all in on plug power in ‘98.
Yea definitely I’m not bearish at all lol I guess I just hadn’t noticed the ridiculousness of NIO’s valuation. It’s easy to see how crazy Tesla is after this past year with the split and everything but I guess I just wasn’t paying enough attention to NIO to notice
Youre joking or what. Tesla has around 2b def revenue. They will finish the year with 30-31. That puts them at 33b and youre saying they are worth 1 trillion market cap. This is a joke
Why nvda?

You‘re right for sure. Imo every car manufacturer would be able to produce a shitload of cars, especially gm or volkswagen. The problem is the missing knowhow and what will limit production is lithium. There won‘t be enough for everyone and i think this will kill the big car manufacturers. 
Btw i‘m hoping nio will succeed. The cars are looking great and the price is great.
This is eye opening. Thanks for the insight!

Good thing I bought NIO stocks (big boy wsb) in anticipation beforehand 😛 Right now it follows the same path like Tesla did years ago. See you all on the moon! 🚀 🚀
Just a readjustment in valuation sentiment. All the paper hands have no faith in Tesla and will run at the sight of it, effectively causing it. The question is where does it land post-run.
Don’t worry. I sold off 75% of mine in the way up. Said “I’m no longer selling” right before the split.

Would have been 1.8 million had I just held.
Air france KLM would be a much better investment if Air France would fuck off
Can't wait till my fellow autists here learn about GigaChad gang. We about to make that shit fly.
Did anyone see the guy with 1.9 million in Tesla shares who isn’t selling so he can get security backed loans. He plans on holding for 50 years and he might be the most retarded person on all of wsb.
Oof, I really need TSLA to open above 900 Monday.
Im shorting as well
Lol banning Parler isn’t bringing down the price of AAPL or Google
My take...I think RC wants people to know it's going to be a bumpy ride but he's got this in the end if they can survive a few more ups/downs...I think he still wanted the price elevated enough for there to be a clear distinction between PA after he went over 10%, juxtaposed against the weak 3Q and holiday days reactions. Look, ICR was a mostly nothingburger last year and THE MARKET by and large believes GameStop's sales are shrinking into Oblivion like Alduin after Dragonrend. 

So let's step back out of our bubble and realize no matter what the fuck gAmEsToP mAnAgEmEnT says Monday AH, the sales are the item that the loud voices on the sell-side, CNBC, etc. etc. that aren't tuned in 100% to the story are going to point as further proof of them dying and digital winning ... I may be wrong, but knowing all that I know that's where I settle on things playing out.
He is, give it some time. There are currently in Norway more EV cars sold than internal combustion ones. Funny detail about it is that Tesla is not even in top 5 brands. And it aint about the price either, we are talking Norway here.

"EXPLANATION:

Thursday, January the 7th at close there was over $700,000,000+ in call options value above the strike price for Jan 15 in SLV options.

Jan 15 was a massively big options contract expiration date going way way back even before Covid-19.

Big players sold those contracts wanting to make money off their shares, they do not desire to lose money.

Big players with deep pockets sold huge amounts of SLV Jan 15, 2021 contracts, with the desire that they close as cheap or as close to worthless as possible. I can't tell you the future, but it is very likely to go down much more next week."

Good points.

What other shorts, put and hedges are you looking at?

It does. I’d take a Fisker Emotion over the roadster though.
If these other companies were worth something Tesla would buy them.

Fact is Tesla is better positioned than all of them and has the biggest market share of the future.
Guaranteed it was designed by a team with the lead over 60 years old. 25 years in the business and there is no way this was not made by some ancient boomer that just learned how to use gradients 10 years to late. If they just made the logo a silver with the slightest gradient to show a reflection it coulda been awesome. The concept is cool but the execution is no bueno.
WELL AKCTCHUALLY,

lol. In all seriousness helicopter checks are not perfect either. You would expect people to just spend the 2G, but they don't. This is purely psychological, but when government sends unemployed people free money, they hoard it and save it as they can, cause govt giving you shit signals that shit is serious.

I mean, it is an emergency measure and should definitely be done.  I just think that a job program that allows you to do whatever , Clean the street, dig a hole , idk, for 2 years while private companies pick up again is a better mid term solution.
I'd be worried if the majority didn't think we were in a bubble. Therefore we aren't euphoric yet, buy buy buy!!!

trust me if that many people think there will be a crash there probably wont be.

I don’t have any validation of those 62 crashes in 3 years, but the point of my post was that crashes are incredibly rare and the fact that it doesn’t happen often with how many flights take off every minute, is incredible. Just looking at the Boeing 737, on average 24,000 flights take off per day, so on the same 3 year time frame that you used, that’s over 26 million flights. Also, taking the max out of the equation, most crashes have been 737 classics over 25 years old. Remember, maintenance has a lot to do with the safety of an aircraft and that is the responsibility of the operator. If I never changed the oil on a Honda Civic for 10 years and one day the motor blew and I crashed and died, it was Honda’s fault? Then there’s pilot error.. the 737 that went down in Mexico recently, the pilot stalled it, Boeing’s fault?

Big oil should not be underestimated but that has little to do with it, use your brain.
It makes sense. These have been very good to you. The beauty of selling far dated calls is that you can always just roll them, and keep the shares. You also don’t owe the taxes until they expire. I just like covering my ass personally. The way I see it, selling those calls means you’ve locked in a 6x return on your money no matter what happens with the stock price.
I will buy that they aren't traditional car manufacturers. But EVEN then I dont buy these valuations. Not being a bear or nothing. Will ride the coaster to the top and I still think we got some juice before the big dip
That sounds lame ....

Wouldn't it mean that their rules would have to be unambiguous, transparent and enforced equally. They would be held accountable for mistakes in enforcement, things they missed and things they wrongly removed.  Removing x for y but not z for y would mean that x could sue to either get z removed or x reinstated.

You played options or stock?
That’s not convincing to me in any way shape or form.

“Family bonds are forever and family bonds cannot be bought and replicated with pets”

This is a very bad take. Not every single family will have merry family members with each other, especially if they’re in abusive & narcissistic households. The only “bonds” in that regard are pain and disappointment. And who says pets cannot have or replicate any familial bonds? Pets may only take up part of our lives in the world, but to our pets, we’re the whole world to them.

“The older you get, the less you can actually do with the toys you worked so hard for”

I don’t know what kind of “toys” you refer to because the only toys that come to mind that’s harder to use when you’re older is gym equipment, which is true if you’re super old, frail and decrepit. Even still, if you properly use those examples of “toys” it’ll keep your body fitter for longer. 

PC gaming you can still do a ton especially when you want to relax away the day. With cars, you can still drive anywhere as long as you have a road route (bonus if it can do off-road). Hell, in America some people have gun fetishes and they still love using their toys even in their older years.

“The less places you can travel...”

The world is a big place. I very much doubt I can experience *ALL* of the world, but you can absolutely travel when you’re older, just not old, frail, and decrepit if that’s what you’re implying.

In 2019, I went on a vacation to California, visiting Yosemite and Lake Tahoe. There are absolutely older people in their 60s/70s you might bump into who just want to walk around and experience the sights and sounds of the places around them, and that’s completely fine!

“...and do activities because you are getting older”

Yes, technically true. I probably can’t do more physical activities like scuba diving, skydiving, or rock climbing when I’m older, might as well get those experiences out when I’m still young!
There’s still fun activities you can do that’s less strenuous like learning new languages, reading, painting, music, and I’ve already mentioned gaming, driving around, and guns (if you’re into that).

But even so, most of the time, I just want to explore around some place new and in the sights and sounds, taste the food, learn about the history & culture. It’s hard right now with COVID, but eventually that will pass.

“Unless your idea of fun is getting wasted at sandal resorts every year etc....”

You don’t need to be drunk to have fun. Sandal resorts and beaches sound like fun though. But I won’t necessarily make myself drunk every time I want to enjoy alcoholic beverages. Wine tasting I can definitely get behind.

Life is what you make of it. Most of us are on WSB because 1) we want to make money and 2) we don’t want so slave away in an office or other stressful workplaces for 40+ hours per week for 40+ years.

Believe it or not, there are people who enjoy being alone, doing whatever they love doing. I don’t see myself being a parent or a family man and I intend to keep it that way. I’m not seeing anybody, and I plan to have a vasectomy once hospitals clear up and it’s safer to travel around and get appointments.

I have been able to get almost my entire family and most of my friends to start investing because I have shown them how easy it is. It has changed all of their lives so much they are constantly calling me to thank me and send me gifts. So its up to you, you can be selfish and keep your knowledge to yourself or you can help lift everyone you know out of poverty.

Yeah... or an enophthalmic eye combined with the other eyeball being enlarged (don't know the medical term for that).  Apparently he's had this since childhood.  Now that I think about it, if he were missing an eye and used a "glass" prosthetic, an effort would be made to make it look as natural as possible ([a one eyed billionaire can afford that sort of thing](http://dollarsandsense.sg/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Mike-Burry-Feb-2011.jpg)).  I'm no better.  I've been told that I've got a mad lazy eye when I've had a drink or two (think Marty Feldman).

As of yesterday NIO was already trading at almost 19x its projected 2021 sales. Tesla is trading at about 18x its estimated 2021 sales. Crazy lol
Here’s the kicker with covered calls that most people overlook:

Anything that has high enough premiums to be particularly appealing to sell, has a very good chance of doing one of 2 things-

1:  Going in to rocket mode and blasting through your strike, this is best case scenario because you're making money.  But, you are making less than you would’ve made if you’d just bought shares and not sold the call. 

-or-

2:  Stock absolutely tanks.  If that happens you collect your premium from the sold call, but on big drops that won’t come close to making up your losses on the shares you’re holding that are drilling to the earth’s core.

Twitter is censoring Trump. CCP is censoring Jack Ma. Our freedom as a society is under attack making us closer to China.

So no it’s not the opposite you retard.

Think about how options work. If you truly want to keep your shares, sell far, far out. No one is stupid enough to exercise a call with more than 180DTE, there’s too much time value there. If it keeps marching higher, just keep rolling out for a credit in the years to come.

It's an enterprise software company. SAP, Siemens, Oracle, Salesforce, and similar, sell enterprise software. Palantir makes a particular kind of software that is customized to the client's needs. Not scalable for the masses, but that doesn't mean that there aren't billions of dollars to be made. For example, Walmart or DHL can easily pay a $100 million for analytics software that improves their logistics operations. A second saved in shipping could mean a billion dollars a year in savings. In the case of Palantir, read the section of Solutions in their website to get an idea of the kind of problems they solve. Companies and governments pay top dollar for an edge on their operations. Does that justify their valuation? Probably, but it depends on their deal making abilities. Other companies could potentially do the same, but if you are asking the question about what they do, it's highly unlikely that you will be able to assess they worth; better stick to it based on trends and memeablility than on fundamentals, or stay away from it.

My post clearly stated I supported free speech for all Americans and I would defend that even if I didn’t like what I heard. Both side of the isle has incited violence via social media and that should not be tolerated. But plain conservative views shouldn’t be censored nor should liberal views.
I smell blasphemy in this post
What makes you think that? Just curious
Creepy they were attracted to themself. They look exactly alike.
I don’t know then. I will say the installed program is better than the web version. Much better interface IMO. Good luck to ya.
Where can i buy calls in the German stock market
Don’t even say that please for the love of god.
Tesla investors are too emotional I’ll only do weekly CCs

Does NVIDIA get to go up as well? Would be nice to see tech stocks finally break out of 4 months of flatness...
Under Jimmy Carter there was double digit unemployment and double digit inflation.  A feat that hadn’t been accomplished since.
Not being a pussy got you this. Use margin and do it again.
For any other stock I'd be screaming that it was time to short.
Interested too

I tried to update my account info and TDA says I can’t update anything for 60 days...so that’s not helpful for my current plays

Any other apps recommended?
Good to know. Thanks
You made 100% profit fam that's still amazing don't chase what could have been 🙅🏻‍♀️
No different than working.
Sell 21 of the $1,000 3/17/2023 calls. You’ll get paid over $700,000 in premium, and you can just roll them out later. That way, even if this blows up for you, it was still a very nice payday.
Can you expand on this I am kinda lacking in knowledge as well? What the point of you borrowing the money as opposed to cashing it out? To avoid tax's? Build credit?
Here's some perspective. I bought a put once, and it did not go well. Now I stay clear of those and only buy calls. Alright, who's sharing next?
Yeah, go after Hillary! I’m not a fan either. Hunter is a piece of shit as well. It’s easier to do with Trump because he has so many potential charges that can be brought against him. 

Pretty sure you’re completely closed off to the idea of Trump actually being a criminal, because you apparently still support him after he openly fomented insurrection against the US government. So yeah, I’m done here.
Dont even look at me peasants.
Probably because burry is tweeting political stuff.
We arent trying to be original. We're trying to stack tendies.
Because it has been rendered obsolete by NIO
Ok, inflation does affect stocks if you consider them goods, but you enter a gray area of valuation/pricing. Now, you see that the price of stocks has been increasing on ridiculous levels, well that is inflation.

Monetary policy shifts demand, nor supply, that is one of the transmission channels.
What happens is that interest rates are so low that they move money, you can actually say that. you could argue that the effect might be different because we are close to the 0% rate.
How it affects? Directly through savings. You don't park your money in the banks because low i, so you look for investments or spend it.

Why it is not affecting goods/services? Maybe due to the oil shock, which was supply related, might be related to consumer expectations... whatever, I am sure there is someone who has written a paper about this.

Now, the main flaw is that you said money is tied and that is why inflation is not here. No it is not, monetary policy is purely and entirely and manipulate the interest rates and add liquidity.

Now, the point to argue is that we are doing QE in extreme proportions and we don't know what defect that will have in the economy, but other than that, this is pure and simple monetary policy, and it looks like the transmission channels are spending the funds to the stock market, what will happen next no one knows.
Wouldnt be surprised if China somehow 'demanded' access to the US market since they've been allowing tesla in theirs for a while now

Is that deal big enough to support a 🚀 to 🪐 or only to the 🌔? My guess is to the 🌔.  And the consoles have to be purchased through GameStop and it’s only Xbox.

If it goes down just buy more. They are on sale then.
So, if  business conditions don't materially change but the price runs up enormously, does the chance of a major correction increase or decline? You don't really think prices can maintain or even continue to grow forever do you? Do you think Tesla can be worth more than the total cash in the world in 10 years? Do you think Tesla are capable of growing fast enough to maintain what these prices mean suggest they must?

Go on linkedin, even VW CEO said they were fucked by Tesla. He admitted it.
I don't think so, that sounds deliberate to me. Even if a bomb blew the plane up it wouldn't fall at 30,000 feet per minute

Being a libertarian and supporting the constitution seem pretty incompatible. And your free speech is not being limited by the government but corporations, which should be in line with your libertarian values

You know I had around that amount of money sitting not knowing what to do because the pandemic had just started so I put it in a secure diversified fund... while you made 10 times+ I made 10%... FML.
No. I think people could assume it involved a max. This one was a 737-500 so it could be pilot error or something that wasn't mechanical.

Man i wish he announces soon
Wasn't the presentation good news? Stock should go up.

But given the IV crush the price of the option should drop around 1.5$, so as long as it opens 64 you won't lose money AFAIK
Mevermind found it
Ok. And....

TSLA: EV for the masses that cost as much as a BMW. 

Markets go wild. 

GM: EV version of our smallest hatch for less than the average new car price. Also our build quality is nominal for the industry, you definitely wont have your roof delaminate in the first 1000 miles or two different colored door panels.

GM shares drop.
Acknowledge that I'm "locked in" for 9 month, but I disagree that it's not worth it. It's a theoretical 30% gain (assuming the stock stays flat) or 67% gain (if it goes to 20) in 9 months with (hopefully) limited downside. If we could do that consistently and at scale we could run a highly successful hedge fund.

Forbes said he adds 2 billion of wealth to twitter.  I will be shocked if they actually keep to the perma ban.  Jack is a dumbass though.

Who knows with Tesla. Three things could push it higher this year: 
1. 1M deliveries (effectively 100% growth)
2. $25k Tesla accelerated (rumors of 2022 in China)
3. Actually solve FSD (stock would go ballistic)

Based on Flight Radar data, its safe to assume it was a mechanical error. I wouldn’t trust Jakarta to maintain an aircraft for 30 years. The pilot probably could have realized there was something wrong with the equipment, but we likely won’t know for certain.
That would have lost you money with Spotify. It dropped at open and only went up 13% in 4 months.
On the bright side, it’s only 8k. Could be worse. Plus you could win bigly

The problem is any plans they may have for all or a chunk of that money are not public information. Eric’s response was basically that Thiel doesn’t know what he’s talking about when it comes to doing things at a company as large and as dominant as Google. 

No he was clearly a bit hostile there. Idk why.

Yes, it is. Most of the products we buy from China come out of Hebei. Massive steel manufacturing there.
Haha thanks. It’s upper 30’s-mid 40’s range here today and we got a little snow yesterday but just a dusting. On the verge of being too cold but we’re good to go
You can Google it but there's someone in bidens administration that works for an investment firm that's heavily invested into nio. Who knows what the future holds
BA will moon to 300+ this week. Many airlines with very old planes now have to order new Boeing Max. IMO BA learning tricks from Apple. Hope they add features like 50% more turbulence after 10 year in service.

Mango needed some controlling. I’m not anti trump, but his social media was too much. I understand these social media companies can make their own rules and do what they want, since it’s their company. They shouldn’t however, be able to just silence the PRESIDENT of the United States. That speaks volumes to the rest of the world watching, and is embarrassing to our country. If we feel the need that Trump needs to be silenced, it should be done through court order, not the judgment of Twitter and FB.
Finally admit to your town your parents are siblings

Why would you have to buy it back at a higher number?

My father always told me “never like a stock. Like a bargain.” And also “a profit’s not a profit til you put it in your pocket.”

I guess, nice paper gain bro.
Is it possible tesla has the same momentum this week?
Hopefully you mean \*covered\* calls.  If so then, yes, this is a fairly good thing, and I've done it in the past.  There is a high premium on Tesla calls and you can generate a good income on it.  Selling naked calls on Tesla is a good way to lose a lot of money fast.

Hebei - a city of 11m in China went into complete lockdown this week due to Covid. People allowed to leave once every 2 days to get essentials. 

Hebei is the steel manufacturing hub of China. As if there was another catalyst needed.

I sold the $780 1/15 put for $10.15 on Friday. I prefer that. Just sell weeklies 10% OTM and sell a covered call if you get exercised.

But don't literally ALL american companies do this? I just got a box of Omaha Steaks delivered and inside were a fuck load of coupons. Wine vouchers, PCH, and LITERALLY "Gold is up 35%, Buy Govt Backed American Eagle dollars!!!". You wanna tell me the boomer higher ups don't have their fingers in gold?????

Elon frantically taking notes on how to host an event. Man, the ET7 was really impressive. That stuff belongs on 100k + cars, from technology (soft close for example) to brutal performance and incredible comfort, slick design...wish I had bought more from the start. 850 shares @ 10.38.
Be careful with NIO. Don’t forget we are dealing with the Chinese government 🤡🤡🤡
3000$ bruh
Wall Street often refers to this as "top ticking" a stock, meaning the fool.bought at the absolute highest tick. Whoever top ticks TSLA deserves a standing ovation from all of WSB.

They only need to cover shorts if they want to cut their losses which I do not think they will do unless they have lost 10s of billions of dollars

Or the shares are recalled by the institutional investors. Which they can choose to do at anytime or *might* be obliged to do upon a private takeover offer
Tesla is the one stock you don’t do that on. Anybody who sold CC this week got their shares called away or had to eat a loss.

All of twice? And for the same continuing situation the 2nd time? Shiver me timbers
Yeah, in the state I live there are only 2 shops certified to work on Tesla cars. Both very close to each other and an hour and half away from where I live. They also are typically booked out 6 months to a year. I have tried getting our shop certified, despite the cost, and actually made it to the second stage but they never communicate with us. We have gotten GM, Ford, Kia, Hyundai, FCA and are about to be Honda Certified. Those companies guided us through the process and had people we could call anytime we wanted. Tesla wants to control it all but if they just focused on building cars and running the company similar to other car companies they would be doing even better. Their cars are really nice and well built, they just need to stick to what they do well.
Honestly I think they might print

This has nothing to do with my comment...
I keep saying tesla is run out and won't go up, then it goes up more, then I say it's run out and won't go up more then it goes up more, then I say it's run out and won't go up more, then it goes up more then I say it won't go up more, then it goes up more. 

I should just buy some.

Based on what ICLN has gained over 2020 (less than 100%?) despite owning First, emphase and Plug, I dont see why people expect it to jump dramatically now.

Let me go ahead and disagree with this. If you have a close relationship with your parents tell them. Keeping secrets from your parents feels terrible, and you will not be able to enjoy the money (like buying an apartment) if your parents keep wondering where the money is coming from and you have to keep it from them. Also, at your age, they can help you with stuff like buying a house or apartment. 

Friends and everyone else is up to you..
Lmao I’m glad you made this. The merchant is awesome.
Anyone else keep seeing her wink or is it just me?
Are you approved to trade options with your broker? If so you can see the price of the option your interested in. $300 doesn’t give you many choices with Tesla. 1day to expiration way outta the money maybe. Could be a winner though. Your broker is fucking you though with those fees.
Im a retard who always remembers
Boyz, what do we think on Monday ? NIO ?
True enough. I think tesla will pullback next week and potentially bring nio down with it. If I see a chance I’ll buy puts on nio never tesla tho
Traderstewie on Twitter says 40 in 4 weeks
9:30 what?  Zimbabwe time?
Time to buy more!!!
Dun dun DUN!
Sorry bro, that's already priced in 😎
I think for the most part, EVs move as an *industry* rather than individual companies. TO AN EXTENT. I just mean, when an EV company comes out with new tech/more attainable cars/etc, it boosts confidence in EVs as a whole.

Well-well, for the very first time it might pay off for not selling before NIO day!
Only a 59% gain in 3 years is not that impressive anymore cause we've been too spoiled to settle for that.
this will be 300$ to 1M EOM.
If I had that kind of money I’d do the same!
I hope Elon sees some of these they're so good

Yes and no. To many of those millionaires, putting 100k on 800% potential gain is the same personal financial risk as the $100 folks.
[deleted]
Or just have it make a move in that direction before then.. you don't have to wait til 3/19 (you can if you want to, of course). For example, if Vale spikes Monday (hypothetical) the value of the call you purchased will increase as well. You can sell it on the open market at any point.
Time to buy more!! 🚀🚀
To be honest I was about to shit my pants after I read OP's post but now my 💎 ✋ become even stronger.
Why don't they rig anything else to be successful then
Xaeiv-12 or whatever will take control
What about Hillary?

Could we find at least one thing to “stick” her with if we really really tried?

What about Joe and Hunter?

The point is if you really really tried to “stick” any of these people with something you could.

It’s just easier to do it with trump because half the county has been worked into a frenzy about him by the media for four years straight

I'm curious how do you borrow against stocks? Just take your statement to a bank?

gratz on FU monei!!
Bad news Equals short term good new .. long term a disaster
Time to buy more!!
scariest times of my life was the hole. I actually dipped out the party, was on my knees and praying to god to not let me die.
Many other stocks are up way more than that % on the year so that doesn’t worry me too much.
Bill Cosby has entered the discussion...
Are they making a superior product? 

And how do you explain the fact that car companies ARE actually making EVs? And outselling the Tesla too in some areas?

Contrary to popular belief, a company isn't made of one person, and tens of billions of R&D will make the ship turn.
And Nvidia
What’s funny about this is that all of their electricvehicles are of the skateboard design. It literally is a retarded elephant on a skateboard

Okay we will see then.
isn't that a good news?
what if tesla branched out into the phone business and started selling a cell phone that has a solar panel on the back sounds like a joke id make about why this company is so overvalued. What if apple made a rocket point is they havent why am i gonna value them based on something they havent tried let alone proved themselves on. your argument is basically, what if tesla go and dominate an entirely new industry they havent entered at all yet, we should value them based on that all because people think the brand is cool. fukin idiotic.

Never heard of supreme or bape
Tesla is almost a trillion dollar company. With diluted shares, it’s a trillion dollars when the stock hits 900$, you think it’ll become a 3 trillion dollar company this year?
There’s a lot more that investors care more about than Twitter losing a handful of users temporarily
😂 only if life were that easy
So you plan to never enjoy any of this money?  Why?
Fuck youuuuuuu but also congrats, but also fuck youuuuuuuu
This will be that point where the shit gets talked by the gay bears and NIO never looks back.....
Bold of you to assume that most of the tesla holders even know what a stoploss is
Exciting!
Well, there is cost, but that wasn't my point at all.
Fuck yeah

Sell half and put it into something that pays a dividend. You can still barrow against it and the dividend on that much would probably pay the loan. 
JEPI....if you put a mill in that, the dividend would be $8900 a MONTH!!! Bet that would make your house, Tesla, and boat payment. You could use the leftover to buy more Tesla if you wanted. Dude don’t be a MC Hammer story!!!

Risk management issue. You don’t actually have that money until you sell. Who knows what happens in your life over next 50 years. Enjoy your money gradually, and steadily, over time. You ain’t “rich” until that shit is in your bank account. But seriously, congrats on hitting the Tesla jackpot. It’s likely once in a lifetime so don’t jeopardize it. 🍻
I have a feeling the news cycle shifts into pandemic mode again on Monday. Not that this week wasn’t a negative week lol. But after such a green one, I just have that feeling that there’s a gut check coming.
X is probably the worst
I fucking love the cybertruck's look
Let me go ahead and disagree with this one. Got close to half a mil in the 2017 altcoin boom. I was 25 back then. Didn’t tell my parents at first, but when I did it was such a relief. You just can’t enjoy the money if your parents don’t understand where it is coming from. Bought a nice apartment in Amsterdam, and although a lot of people may brush it off, that kind of transactions feel pretty heavy when you are doing it for the first time. Imagine not being able to discuss this with your parents..

It does help that my parents, as well as my brother and other close family are doing pretty well themselves too. If you are from poorer background it may be more difficult.
Don’t worry, GME gang. Our time will come. PLTR, I’m sure you too will have your time in the limelight.
Let's go I'm here!

If Apple bans Parler, TWTR stands to benefit.
Dude probably exercised some options. He must really believe in the company to do that. 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀
No you're apparently just really bad at math and also don't know the difference between revenue and earnings. I would expect nothing less from someone who thinks Tesla is a great value and would be justified in growing much higher from here in the near future.
Is is too late to jump into Nio on monday?
How do you know he won't sell?
That means they would have mentally insane parents
Fuck you and enjoy the round.

Congrats NIO bulls
Repost, but thanks for trying.
Yes I’d guess it’ll drop back down to 700 soon. But then again, I thought there would be a correction at 600 too lol
Some asked about CRWD....my take

They beat SolarWinds hack and now are actually contracted by SolarWinds to beef up their endpoint cybersecurity.  Look at how insane last CRWD earnings and guidance..which was BEFORE all this SolarWinds drama and newslow.  Amazing setup.  Also, We still only see tip of the iceberg with that hack...newsflow will continue over the coming months for sure.

Remote work, IoT, cloud, etc is blowing up and the future.  Both network traffic and hacks at all time high and will only grow exponentially.

How can you not be bullish on the #1 cloud endpoint cybersecurity player?

Stocks don’t like drama or uncertainty. Twitter will probably start to go back up
No you didn’t lol it completely contradicts you
Even if it did surge, you'd make the call money, and prob sell at the top. Buy back in after a correction. Seems like free money either way.

You heard the man puts on school and jobs!!!
The vehicles themselves are actually pretty nice cars, fun to drive, built well and while they are not as easy to work on as a domestic or Asian car I think they are easier than European. The problem is they are not profitable to work on because parts are 50% of profit on most cars you work on. So no one wants to work on them. If you want to become certified you can make money on the parts but it is almost impossible and costs 100s of thousands.
Not exactly a good sub to ask since people here are trolls, you should learn fundamentals first.

I want to understand what you're saying because you sound as if you're an authority, but I've never in my life heard anyone say money has intrinsic value.

reading these two lines, I guess I have no idea how the bond market works.

\> If China liquidated all of its bond holdings, the Fed is liable to push those dollars out of the unrealized space and into the economy. 

If China sold its fixed income from the US govt, that cashflow is going to someone else and it'll have a higher yield. I'm not sure what the Fed has to do with this unless the Fed is buying these US bonds from China for some reason.

\> When the Fed buys a bond they don't pay anyone for it, they promise to pay them at maturity. 

This reads like someone is loaning money to the fed. If the Us gov sells a zero coupon bond, for example, the government gives the bond holder the face value of the bond at maturity. The fed can buy an infinite amount of these (or any other security) and manipulate the discounted price and yield.

Bonds are assets because they are a cashflow to the bond holder.

You need to learn the difference between revenue and earnings before you try to do any more math to justify your fanboy fantasies.

The whole EV sector tends to move together, but the TSLA bubble popping will not drag down others at this point. TSLA is at a P/E ratio of 1630..... It's gonna come down on its own. Wouldn't be surprised to see a bit of a rise in other EV makers as TSLA holders who take profit during the correction rotate some money into EV stocks that still have room to grow

Problem is that if Trump acknowledged the virus and even went as far as lockdowns enforced, you know what would happen? 

The Democratic party and all of the left leaning media would try to convince the public that it's the OPPOSITE of what Trump is saying that we should be doing.

They really don't have a consumer level product. Every ultra valuable company I know deals directly on the consumer level through a service or product. The customer loyalty is what drives the prices so high.

Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Google, Amazon all have direct links to the end user. I don't think pltr is ever going to be in the same level cause we have no connection to them or their product.

I think you're reaching a bit. More realistically, Overlord Musk is going to utilize the Many Worlds Theory of quantum mechanics so that Tesla can justify their market cap using revenue from every conceivable universe.
I feel that. I move around soo much less now than I did before COVID. Even though I make it to the gym 3 times per week, that doesn’t really make up for how sedentary I am the rest of the time
Seems like it reliably will trade sideways for 24-48 hours then proceed to absolutely moon for 12 hours then go back to bouncing from support. If you need any reason to be bullish, it would be the fact there is practically no "dip" to buy in at. Had I not pussyfooted around waiting for a crash, I would have much more rn

With all due respect, you are just repeating the version of history that’s taught in college. Its not even remotely true. The government and Federal Reserve directly caused the Great Depression, and have caused every boom and bust since. 

To quote someone smarter than me “the government will break both of your legs, hand you a crutch, and tell you that without them, you wouldn’t be able to walk. “

Once you loose your freedom, what else do you have?

Also I wouldn’t go crazy on my short just a couple K. I feel like it’s a smarter way to kind of short my holdings in Tesla because I have a fair amount of money tied up in Tesla and rather than short Tesla I figure I can short NIO which I believe in less than Tesla and if Tesla ever crashes I feel like NIO is going to be on that ship.

What news?
Ok thank you
Yes, but like all things it's an exchange of assets. 

I trade liquidity for illiquidity. 

The large scale operations make these assets increase in value so that when repurchased or sold, more money leaves the economy than went in. So, while there is short-term money on the table it's not actually a gain... If that makes sense?

For example let's say you demand a little extra coitus from your wife. Because you're so disappointing she has to get pounded by her boyfriend 2x for every 1x you do her. Not only that, but he gets mad when you get some so he does her one more time each time you do her. This means that while you're getting a little more slurp slurp, she's getting wrecked more and more each time. So while you get some extra loving short term, she gets worn out long-term. **DISCLAIMER:** This is not how sex works. 

I guess I didn't hammer that home in my post, this is the 3rd question like this. First I buy $NKLA $100 Calls and now this.

OTOH, aren't EV companies battery-production constrained?  NIO's model means they need to produce >1 battery for every NIO EV that's on the road.  Will that be a bottleneck?  


It also means they're amassing an inventory of batteries which will be obsolete in a few years as battery tech improves
Happened the previous Monday too  

Asking cuz I went all in spy calls
The issue is the “all they have to do now is make electric cars”. Thats an incredibly overarching statement that is based on the premise that gas car companies can make good electric cars. I dont think you would go to a tax lawyer who practiced for 20 years and say, “all you have to do now is become the best criminal lawyer”... same to a heart surgeon (and tell him to be a brain surgeon). 

Furthermore, if your entire R&D and outsourcing contracts with factories and etc develop gas car parts and products, youre not just “making EVs now” youre essentially overhauling your whole supply chain and work force. 

Tldr: Contrary to what many ppl believe, brands dont keep its customer loyalty long unless they deliver. If tesla makes superior products, ppl will b compelled to switch.
Yay a whole 3-4% of software revenue per year per the article, huge win, totally justifies being called a tech company!

Removing a viable platform for any opposing political party is scary. This is what China does. It's not that hard to understand how it's a slippery slope towards bad things when only ONE party's opinions are allowed on a public PLATFORM.

All of these platforms (Apple, Google, Youtube) are monopolies, no 'smaller' platform will ever be able to compete since money talks and these companies have millions and billions to throw around to make sure Parler WILL CLOSE.

You don't lose money when a stock goes down, or gain money when a stock goes up. The current value is the potential you would have if you sold. You lose or gain potential. Because a company share is pretty much like a baseball card.

Good job referencing one quarter from last year in only one part of the world. Nice cherry picking of stats there
Sounds like a reasonable comparison.

Likewise, check out cash secured puts.  You’re basically doing the opposite ... you sell a put at a strike you’re willing to buy the stock at, collect the premium, and if stock price drops below the strike you get assigned the shares.  Otherwise you keep the premium.

Same (but reverse) situation as the CC.  For example, I sell a put for GOEV at $15 for, say, $1.00.  In this situation I’m willing to pay $15 a share for the stock, so $1500 gets held by broker as collateral.  If stock is $16 at expiry then no biggie ... I made the $100 from the premium paid.  But if it drops to say $13 on expiry then I am basically paying $2 more per share than what the market will pay.  

(This is a simple example and doesn’t take into consideration the premium paid, I.e., in the example above my avg cost would technically be $14 because I collected $1 in premium).

Both are good tools to use to get in/out of stocks you want.  And if you don’t know then look at The Wheel strategy.  With the Wheel you basically use CC and CSP to flip stocks.
Nahhhhh they’re literal 🔥🔥🔥
Hell yea, keep doin the damn thing

That is the best of many ways of viewing covered call writing.

Own shares in stocks you believe in and sell CC's on them at a strike price that is identical to your preferred exit price.

The trick to making this strat especially profitable is to use some reliable technical indicators to find the top of pumps so you can sell when IV is high.

But be careful. I sold some CC's on PSTH yesterday afternoon about 30 minutes before SP pumped 10%. I missed out on the chance to double the collected premium.

One of the main benefits to stopping by here periodically in my opinion.
Cathie says like $7k by 2024, think the pop is going to heavily depend on when Tesla stops performing. If they can keep releasing major news at the pace they have their share price could stay inflated till the entire market crashes.

Ok.  Well, that's a start.

There are plenty of people who use covered calls to generate additional yield.  It's almost mandatory fixed income doctrine due to the reality that dividend yields are effectively constrained by the risk free rate of return (currently at all time lows).

There are certain stocks that are better suited for this sort of thing.  Maybe have a look at the FastGraphs youtube channel.  I don't really play in this part of the market.
Tesla has more going for it than just cars. But from a purely cars perspective, Tesla has both a cool factor and status factor that for example, owning a Ford EV doesnt have.

Tesla also has Musk, who is an entrepreneur. Even if a bit eccentric, its his creativity that can power the company to new heights. What is Ford or Volkswagon going to innovate? They are basically just car companies. Even if they tried to innovate it goes against peoples perception of them.

I mean what if Tesla branched out into the phone business and started selling a cell phone that had a solar panel on the back, or came with a little solar array to charge it? It might be a novelty at first, but in reality if the phone was well designed people might start regularly owning Tesla phones. If they did this, nobody would really bat an eye. If Ford came out with a phone, people would laugh and probably never consider buying one.
It's probably more likely under biden. Most libs I know think that's it's be perfectly reasonable to cancel all student debt, since apparently taking 4 years of gender studies is something society should pay for collectively with a ton of inflation.
If the shares go up, you have fomo.  If the shares go down more than your option cost, you lose money.  And remember you would need to buy back your option in order to sell those shares, so you aren't always as liquid as you'd like to be.

TSLA had 60,000 vehicle deliveries (cumulative) EOY 2014, six years after they began

NIO had 60,000 vehicle deliveries (cumulative) EOY 2020, also six years after they began

NIO is on track and I think they can scale up production a lot faster than TSLA. Moreover, because of their BaaS strategy, their cars are more affordable. 

The next big step for NIO is to get to Europe, then America.

That's true when there is a credible alternative reserve currency though.  Nobody is going to buy EUR or Yuan given their political risks right now.
They're already manufacturing at the speed to guarantee 50% growth in 2021. They're going to be getting closer to 100% growth, because of the additional factories opening this year.

Riiiiight exactly how Twitter wants you to think. They definitely don’t have the entire world on their platform and have influence to change world events depending on which information they allow or disallow. Totally ok to ban the US PRESIDENT but still leave the CCP and their concentration camps and the ayatollah of Iran and his hate speech death to Jews rhetoric and it’s ok to leave the countless people calling for trumps beheading but the president himself is ok to ban.

The entire annual solar and automotive sales industries in the US are $565B. 

Tesla is currently valued at like $780B. 

Is every single car sold in the US a Tesla? Is every single solar panel sold in the US Tesla?
Slept great last night. Feel awesome! Life is good

isn’t it a spectrum between limited and no government? Have definitely heard libertarians advocate for children prostitutes if there is a market for it because of the free market.

Yeah those policies worked prior to WWII but the great depression and WWII made leaders realize with great wealth and responsibility the role of government is to ensure peace and security. 

If we had no social security, medicare, a weak military in the 21st century we’d be a miserable back water. Yes government is fucked up, inefficient and completely out of wack. That doesn’t mean the richest country on earth isn’t responsible for caring for all of its citizens

No shit elon is the CEO for SpaceX. I'm saying you can't include its finances and intertwine it with TSLA. They are separate entities. I don't think tsla is just going to be selling cars, but all that stuff he's doing or planning on doing is already priced in x2. 800b+. Let that sink in. I'm not saying you can't make money with TSLA, but to believe fundamentally it can go higher is something else. The price can definitely go higher due to hype, memes, and people like you who believe and ignore fundamentals.
For growth stonks I sell if the price falls below SMA50. I sell all growth positions if SPY falls below its SMA100.

That avoided most of the Feb/Mar pullback last year.

You just have to be comfortable with the possibility of losing your shares but that’s it. Do it right and you can keep selling covered calls on the same shit and just keep lowering your cost basis on the original shares. When I first found out about covered calls I did them on smaller cap stocks and almost tripled my account. Paid for around 200 shares and end up with around 700 then keep it moving
Nothing new happened on NIO day. It had all been said before to pump the stock. Nothing to worry about tbh

>It matters when you’re talking about the sentiment of the country... which is why you brought up a slim margin of victory in the first place. Isn’t that what you were implying? That the country is equally divided, thus a move like this could harden that divide?

Nope, I was saying they barely managed to win, and they're trying to press that victory as if they were absolutely untouchable. A tiny bit of blowback from being a sore loser and trying to twist the knife just to hurt Trump's ego/legacy and they can easily lose the next election.

Possibly the stupidest decision they could ever make trying to punish and humiliate the loser after failing to do so once already. Especially since two of the states that Trump lost by slim margins are usually Republican and will likely swing back that way next election even without the Democrats being vengeful toward an outgoing president.

How? And that’s not relevant to the point you were making. That somehow this crash was continuing to fuck up. 

Definitely the 737 max debacle was bad, but that’s resolved with the fine. 

Might be a short term dip but I wouldn’t buy puts other than as a day swing
If anyone should be treated as a publisher it should be the user and they should be held accountable. Newspapers sold subscriptions and people who held those were subscribers. you subscribe to a persons YouTube, Twitter, Facebook feeds. Therefore anyone having any number of subscribers should be held accountable if they're rant or anything of the sort leads to property damage, injury, or even death. As much as people don't want to admit it there is a part of our country that doesn't fact check and believes a lot of false information spread by people on these platforms. The printing press was never the culprit the printers were same with Twitter and Facebook.

I think so too. By driving the price back above 880, they were able to expire an insane amount of puts from 830-880 price ranged. Like 500k+ put options were taken out. This vastly outnumbered the call options that were open.

I just looked into it more. I think you’re right... no legal penalty for doing this. It’s just up the the broker to enforce (though the 4 day trades in 5 days is a standard)
The downside is that if the stock moons and the buyer exercises, you miss out on the gain in share price above the break even.

Example:

You sell a call for XYZA with a strike of $10 and a premium of .50 expiring on Friday

You are paid $50 (.5 premium × 100 underlying shares) and your 100 shares are held as collateral. The buyer is given the contract and has a break even price of $10.50.

But on Friday, XYZA hits $20. The buyer exercises his contract and you sell your $20 shares for $10 a piece and all you have left is the $1050 from selling the shares and the premium paid. When if you had just held the shares you would be sitting at $2000
I’m not ballsy enough to pay that game and risk paying the tax / having to buy back in for a higher number

can someone explain to my noob brain how this made so much money? I want to yolo like this too but I don't understand.
So the person buying you call is speculating the price will move above your strike.

What if you had TSLA when it was trading around 400 in november and you sold a  sweet 1x call at 450 strike expiring december for like 20.  December comes and TSLA is peaking at 700.   

You made like 7k but missed 25k.

If it continues on a tear and you really wanted to own the stock, now you have to try and buy back in.
[removed]
That’s a complex topic...employers were looking for skilled workers that were in limited supply.  Carping about “low quality jobs” when dipshits spend 100k plus to get worthless degrees that aren’t desirable in the job market....that’s a bs argument.

I’m long. I don’t see Armageddon happening. You buy extremely cheap options to hedge extremely unlikely events. When you’re right, it pays off big. Many notable hedge fund managers, like Bill Ackman, have or had a short position on corporate credit. That massive trough in March on the chart? That’s why you do it. Wow, why am I explaining myself to a moron lol
In the meantime many Tesla stock holders are reading this in their new yacht

I've never even heard of that app until last night.
Europe contributed to the spread as well. A lot actually, especially in ny.

What the problem was was that foreign nations extracted their citizens from China, despite China’s warning, which furthered the spread globally.

I support his decision to restrict travel from China personally, but there are details we overlooked here.
Honestly I feel like it was all priced in. Nothing from the event we didn’t know yesterday. I could see nvda run from it tho and that lidar at company

ARKK and ArkG are actively managed. Don’t you think they can cut and move into different investments in some sort of massive crash?

Your profit is capped at the strike price, whatever price the security reached in excess of the strike price is that buyers profit (minus premium of course). Scenario C is when the security goes beyond the strike price and the not so stupid buyer makes money. Calls cost premium because they’re actually worth something.

Lol like me in bed.
Is this with options? I have $300 and want to buy Tesla options and was told from a friend rather that that wouldn't be enough to get 100 shares. I thought options were cheaper with way more risk involved tho?

For example, at my broker, its $7.99 per trade and $1.25 per contract. So I think 100 shares would be enough to be under the $300 limit i have no?
No. It might have if this happened during a trading day, but follow up stories are going to show this is a nothing burger.

Terrible for the families involved, but it was a 26 year old plane and a way older model than the one they had issues with before.
i thought Tesla was overpriced at 500 and again at 600 and again at 680 and again at 720.

This week i decided to buy $5000 in shares and im up 17% already after 4 days.

Most people don’t have access to N95 masks. Notice how they use the words ”can” and ”may”? Social distancing is ten times more important than wearing a mask, and wearing a masks has been shown to provide a false sense of safety.
Software sales are irrelevant, they're tied to the physical units of the cars which have a low production count. That's why it's utter lunacy when people try to claim they should be valued as a tech company.

Tech companies either produce software completely untethered to unit sales - like Microsoft, or they sell high numbers of units at a relatively low cost like Apple. Cars are neither of those scenarios, they're a high barrier to finance and purchase and hard to produce and ship to the buyer.

Tesla will have to execute perfectly with basically no headwinds for decades before they "rip" high enough to meet their current stock price. Much less actually make a profit for the stockholders.

It's pretty straightforward. Two downsides, shares go down and then the amount of premium is not enough to cover the loss on value of shares and you lose money. Or, depending on the strike price, share price goes up substantially and you are forced to sell it cheaper than you could have.

Dog, the senate majority leader said on Wednesday that there wasn’t fraud to the level that would alter the election results.  This election had the same margin as 2016 when Trump won.

I think there’s at least a 5% gap up for Monday across the board. 

Between the price action yesterday and then the AH pump, it’s clear market shook final weak hands out into next week. 

There’s going to be a local top ahead but if CMC isn’t much higher than $23, could be an opportunity as their ER is after the bell and they would still be undervalued at that price. 

VALE under $20 at open is still an opportunity. And MT under $26 would be as well.

It literally says it helps slow the spreading of corona virus. Maybe I'm not understanding your point... why would masks be bad if they can still mitigate spreading. I know their not perfect & you can still catch it, but why would it not be wise to wear it to protect others?
It matters when you’re talking about the sentiment of the country...  which is why you brought up a slim margin of victory in the first place.  Isn’t that what you were implying?  That the country is *equally* divided, thus a move like this could harden that divide?

Any plans to avoid the tax? Capital gains is a bitch but it’s already considered a long term investment so the tax you have to pay is at its minimum
You probably have a 87 IQ
Bet you got them salty “chocolate” balls
I made $22k this week alone. https://imgur.com/a/E3SBh2Q
It was 2021 lol... with IV and the massive gap up it had I’m guessing that’s it. I didn’t look at all the Greeks though so I couldn’t really be sure how/why it went that high
I see stuff like that with their newer web app a lot but not ToS or the old web app.
Nah, that’s not actually why.
first 100k is a bitch
Any insider trade info your profession could throw our way let me know ✌️😉 seriously though iron ore’s breaking 170 next week easily. 180 by EOM and gg after that.

Yes the crash of an almost 30 year old plane they’ve had nothing to with since they sold it is shooting themselves in the foot

I’m sure the market will go down but I don’t think it’s the plane this time.
Ford would be a great acquisition, but the pension obligations are a real bear.
They FOMOed into Tesla then paperhanded the dip
That’s it, man.  Downside is the losses (?) from the stock rising.  For example, I sold a CC on ICLN a couple of weeks ago and then it boomed.  Sure I collected premium and will make a little profit between my avg cost and the strike I sold, but I’m also missing out on all the gains from the stock flying past the strike I sold.
Guys i need money asap. What do you thing about shorting Boeing?
Most of my portfolio is shares too
That’s the government’s fault for wasting the first two months, when China was combating the virus. Trump should have warned people instead of downplaying it, and increased medical supply production way earlier (experts warned the us was not prepared for a pandemic).

I think you are talking about lockdowns. They work, but that requires uniformity in implementation, not opening one state and closing the other. Also, people need to be disciplined enough to not gather in large groups and actually follow the guidelines. As we saw before, we failed both spectacularly.
Sometimes I am early, and often I am wrong.

Looks like a good time for a dot com crash
Lol. Normally CNBC is shit but that part stuck out. I don’t think it’s a negative.
> 19 people killed during BLM priests, probably more because media etc are actively trying to keep the number down 

> “5” people die during the trump “insurrection”. 1 killed by police. 4, of which maybe 1, was actually related to protest.

But that isn’t the case. There’s 7 more million people that voted for Biden, which suggest to me that, yes the country is divided, but not by a small margin.

I don't know why you keep bringing up the popular vote, it is completely and utterly irrelevant to this conversation about the margins of the win.  There were a total of 50k votes that decided the winner, regardless of how you ***wish*** it was counted.

Nio day condensed. New ET7 sedan looks dope. Using NVDA chips. With 150 kw battery, it’s officially the longest range EV available. 600+ miles. Rolling out full autonomous driving and not just assisted driving. Overall. Looking forward to Monday. I stopped buying in at $19, but I guess now you just buy high and sell higher?

It’s not a matter of believing in masks, it’s about the science. The impact masks have is relatively small and more than likely gives people a false sense of safety (they may stop practising social distancing simply because they’re wearing a mask).
Nah. Been doing it 30 plus years

Huh kinda like inciting a riot to storm the capitol building and being let it in by the cops to do harm kinda has a treasonous vibe to it. Trump tweeted that Pence was a traitor while people were storming the Capitol, what the else would you call it?

The guidance will be insane as raw inventory will be harder and harder to come by in coming weeks. If NATIONS are shutting down exports because of how low supplies are, scrap is going to moon as it becomes a vital source to top off whatever is available.

Oh there’s a huge gap up coming. 

I really think Friday early afternoon was the last chance to get in on this leg up. There will be more but seeing a local top coming shortly after. 

If the gap up isn’t huge I’d enter, if it is huge, just lower expectations in short term gains. Especially in options as IV will explode.

Pretty scary stuff.

Don’t blame Rh wtf?

I don't think BA will get hit too hard. It was a 26 year old plane in a cheap Indonesian airline. They probably skipped steps on maintenance or inspections if anything

No offense taken mate. Michigan has a top five undergrad business program. Third according to [this ranking](https://www.usnews.com/best-colleges/rankings/business-overall).

I was actually an economics major but took relevant courses in the business school (finance, accounting, some ancillary courses I thought were interesting). The Michigan brand made it pretty easy to get investment banking interviews. Did that for four years and now work in private equity.

By the way, I use retard on this sub but this sub only haha. Would never speak in such a condescending way otherwise lol
I think I was in that stock for 6 years, and lost like 90% of its value before I sold.... And now its running.

So no. Not bullish. Fuck AMRS.

Not to be that guy, but right now you owe a huge tax bill on short term capital gains to uncle sam. If you lose part or all of that gain, you cannot offset 2020 gains with 2021 loses. Sell enough to at least cover expected tax bill. Would hate to see you end up in the negatives if a correction happens and wipes you.

Never sell
There are rules and regulations of ETF’s where they can’t just put 99% of the money into one stock to pump in to the moon. ARKK has had around 10% in tesla for ages, and they have to sell some of it to keep it at 10% when it increases in value.

Thanks for this, I forgot to sell my contract for NIO. It’s not much but it was something I bought during the dip Friday. So I might come out on top then.
let me just put it this way. if tesla tanks next week nio is going down with it idgaf how good the event was.
I can bear to wait for you retards to crash.

Maybe pent up demand for the ID.3 and ID.4. But the Audi e-tron sold 4061 units in 2019 year and 3764 units in 2020. So even though they went down a bit, not nearly as much as Tesla did.

And in the next year there will be many more new EV models with 'pent up demand' that will take a bite out of Tesla.
Just learned that the dot com crash was actually precipitated by the Russians defaulting on their debt.  People moved out of anything deemed risky, of which internet stocks were.  

In a similar way, we could be approaching a point where any damn thing could cause a bit of a market slide.

And yeah, Boomers are dramatic.

Really in which fund
Hi!
Yield curve was inverted, business investment was slowing down, and global economy was screeching to a halt in 2019. Covid smashed an economy on the verge of shifting gears. Every “boom” has a “bust”. The warning signs were already there.
Sounds awesome for a company founded in Nov 2014 !
Why aren’t Facebook or Twitter removed then? Both have absolutely been used to incite violence.
737 go crash 💥
Do you know what you just said? lol 

Anyway, im not personally against your stance. But from society’s point of view, your way of thinking is quite destructive.
Maybe he's confused with margin. I'm currently holding around 350-400 shares of TSLA, I paid total margin of 69k$ which I don't have in my account right now. If I sell all of my holdings, I'll have 103k$ in my account
Why is everyone suddenly worried about TSLA?
All the people bragging about it are the same people that will continue to hold it and will be crushed when the EV bubble pops.

Is this what they mean when they say just be yourself and she will like you
That's what I'm thinking. It was a 26 year old plane from some cheap Indonesian airline. It's almost certainly some short cut on an inspection or maintenance

It doesn’t matter. It won’t change my statement. She’s holding a shit load. Like millions upon millions.
Well can’t you just keep your 400 stonks and sell something else for the leaps ? Would be double ride to the moon
No issue there. Supply Chain is good. When we see a big reopening nationwide of all restaurants - the time will be upon us. I’ll let everyone know in a DD.
the second he sells 4 CC’s on it the stock is gonna moon lmao
welp i guess im taking Bali off my list fk that
Check out a pizza place maybe? Unless you have a gyro shop
Do you think if the US was all middle class and above, that everything would be great?

Do you understand how many people do shitty, lower class jobs, with no health care benefits but are critical for society?  Should we just dismiss those people that make $15/hr and tell them to pay $1k/month for insurance since they don’t get it through work?
450 EOY target.
Rod Alzmann fucks!    🚀   🚀   🚀
Imagine making that much money and still not understanding where the $ goes.
PLTR is long term hold for me, they are expanding like anything every second day there is new contract announcement!
they need to pass crash test regulations first. And USA crash test is the major reason why we didn't get many of the cool cars over the years.
Since I only wear plain t-shirts and work coats, they are avoiding me as well. Used clothes enthusiasts are usually funnier.
We'll see what happens pre market
Sooo soooo many tendies.
It’s better than their current logo but it doesn’t look timeless like a logo of this magnitude should.
Positions or ban
Had 13 shares at that price, sold it around 300, didnt know any better. Would be around 45k instead of 1.5k that I made
You made a lot of great points and they're points I need to consider when I revisit TSLA.

In the end I'm not exactly bearish on TSLA, these are ultimately my non-expert opinion. If TSLA Q4 is bad, it'll drop hard but that just gives me a perfect opp to buy in!
I’m more afraid of the Tesla bubble popping and dragging NIO down with it. 

545 shares at 47 cost basis here.

The amount of upvotes shows me how many sad people that missed out there are lol
Same. I was penny pinching the last time more shares were offered.

Me and my penny pinching ways. Fuck.
I decided to sell a covered weekly call for $36 this week!!!! Weeee! Good thing my cost basis was $20. Lol still made money, but not worth the $46 to not Stil have my shares hahahhahah 

I belong here.
Yup, there's an age there.

I don’t think it will on the first test. Especially if it gets there next week.

Early 30s, basically r/investing gang, I still yolo from time to time but not often lol
In China, the government silenced a big business man. Here, big business silenced the government.
Yea I don’t any problem taking profits. But I’ve never missed out on 30k+
All I have to do is buy one share of Tesla and I’ll wreck the whole thing. Guaranteed.
Not the same as buying 100 shares for $100 dollars lol. Yes the max loss in this situation is what you paid for the contract. Options are risky and this guy had good luck, most companies are not like Tesla right now. And no they don’t need 80k, like he said they sell the contract to someone else to exercise, they’re the one who would need 80k.
I had a long losing streak so it feels good.
Fucking shit man. You’re crazy. I’ll rip a line of coke for u !
Nope she’s still holding a shit load.

i bet nio has a legendary mooning on monday and i fomo in at the top before it dips back to $20 the next day
Geez another Boeing plane crashed 😬
Yeah and that's where I'm getting in again
Honestly? Depends on tesla

If FSD actually becomes a thing this year (you watched the beta vids yet?) then 200 is totally likely/possible
To each their own. I like CGC too, I bought a ton of shares in all weed companies when they hit bottom. I assume you know already about the $TLRY/$APHA merger and how they own sweet water and already have footprints in the US, ready to saturate our markets with edible products. Either way, \[Rocketship emoji x3\] \[tree emoji x3\]

Dude yes. What was so crazy was I’d made a shit load off ba the day before, then had like 3 -10k days immediately after.

Horrible feeling. Now I’m almost all leaps and theta gang, and it’s somewhat less exhilarating but way less stressful.

Glad we’re both recovered and I hope everyone here makes money.
American depository receipts. Foreign shares usually list in US via ADR. Not sure why, but that's the case for BABA and NIO
Sell CCs. It'll make them seem a bit lighter.
They’re making billions on the Internet network the taxpayer developed. I’m starting to see how the public-spectrum argument the FCC uses for radio licensing could be applied to require certain free-speech and competitor access requirements from Big Tech.
They invented a HTML 5 based supercomputer to power their EV's.
I didn't fully get it, what happened exactly?
What brought you back? In the same boat as you -99%
who else got SRPT calls 🙌 

Cathie scooped up 850k shares after that 50% dip 🤑

TSLA 900c 1/15. Am I gonna be happy or sad by Friday??
Dudes who need to sell them
Thanks for the info.

Tesla *is* doing amazing:

https://www.ev-volumes.com/

You bring up two tiny countries (which Tesla didn't necessarily prioritize this year). The id.3 just hit its production ramp, which means we might be seeing pent-up demand. We'll see how things level off.

However, it is certainly true that the id.3 is impressive and is a serious competitor. We'll have to wait to observe its staying power, and whether VW can continue to innovate.

Also, EV companies increasing sales is the norm, because EVs are an expanding market :) Good for them!
Im subscribed to her mail list where she sends eod every buy and sell order
Don’t let that be the biggest mistake of your life. 1.8 million bucks is 1.8 million fucking bucks I don’t give a fuck how rich you are. Congrats
🌎🧑‍🚀🔫🧑‍🚀
It does matter, maybe you havnt followed BA before? The only reason BA ever took a dump was Covid. It had a straight year+ of horrible news press and flights crashing amd it barely dropped near $300. This news might make it fall a bit but if anything its short term or a non news
wow, a 2-month old account claiming to make 34200% in that same timeframe

very cool
Computer engineering is different than computer science.  CE makes the hardware, CS makes the software.
I'm never getting on a plane in Indonesia
So you’re gonna buy a put where the only time the outcome is profitable is if there is an Armageddon? Congrats. You really are a retard.

I dunno. Trump may need to be thrown in prison to stop his insurrection ploys.
Bro imagine being against central banking in 2020. If we weren’t able to print out money (1800’s style) we would be so unequivocally fucked. I don’t even know why libertarians still exist.
Bro this minor cold and not that contagious shit is just bs. I work in a school, we’re all in person. Masks are insanely effective. Kids throw a party? A BUNCH get covid, yet our contact tracing shows it doesn’t spread through the classroom even when someone in class tested positive. The athletes who got it all talk about how terrible it is, most have lung damage. Two of my coworkers got it, one of them died. I can almost agree with lockdowns being unnecessary, but only with universal masking. Need more interaction? Form a pod.
And also borrow large amounts of $$ at very low interest rates to buy or do whatever I need to do
Buy them Tesla’s, duh..
gm = gay men
Made 2k on TSLA/green energy this week, thinking about buying the cheapest Feb 2/5 call i can afford and selling before earnings to play on the volatility. Normally, I wouldn't take the risk, but  TSLA loves ignoring fundamentals. What do my fellow autists think?

Your wrong about Champion. The trend busted already. I used get made fun of for wearing it in elementary school. It will never touch Nike or Adidas.
Historically a lot of people sell their shares. Especially if the value has significantly increased. A lot of people in the lockup have no interest in the stock market and have no interest in holding for the long term, they just want their cash and go out and start shopping. Be prepared for a significant sell off. This might not be what you want to hear but it’s a very realistic scenario.
Bullish, CRWD.  Sorry, saw the opportunity for a shamless plug, so I took it.
Dont be a pus.sy, go staking
It's coming, 3 months maybe 6 months definitely
Probably buying shares in the premarket, and calls late afternoon.
N P A == AST SpaceMobile released a pump video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-PNMOUOroTc

It's a bit cringe but gets the point across. It's a space based mobile network without need for special handsets, speaks normal 4/5g bands. They already tested their antenna now it's just a matter of getting their first birds approved and launched.
it’s saturday.... no premarket to look at. Fuck!
What? Are you high right now?

But whatever. That wasn't the point.
r/shittylifeprotips
I use RH and I plan on holding the shares through a merger. Will that effect anything? Or is this only for folks who want out when a target is chosen and their money back? I assume I'll be able to sell at any point for the sale price at the time.
thanks.
Well then, you should be prepared for when they enforce plant limits for home growers (as they already do in some states). Big brother doesn't care about pot use, but underground sales that aren't being taxed will mean hefty fines. Undercover cops will be everywhere.
I have 100k in shares and another 100k in 35$ 2/19 calls.
Who here avoids all females
Never selling?   Also never realizing any gains.   At least you'll be able to share screenshots with your internet friends.

Boeing...babe...again?
It is used as a metric to gauge relatively what a company should be worth, not as a stand alone metric. If you don't think for a second other car manufacturers are gonna be doing the same and be left in the dust, you are delusional. They may not be first, or maybe a tsla 2.0 will come about by the time all this "growing into" happens, they will provide competition. Also starlink is a spacex product, not tsla.

People say its normal and just re-balancing. But I don't think people who control such vast amounts of capital are so retarded not to realise this thing could pop any day.

Even if it goes back up, a short term pull back is looking pretty likely.

I'm not disagreeing on weed stocks. I think the winners will be american and not the current canadian firms. Big CPG will win. I'm disagreeing with you saying growing is easier than a brew.
TSM is such a badass. For decades, China has been consistently headhunting their top engineers just to compete but have failed. Their moat is fucking solid. LONG $TSM.
I love the weeeeed sector, but I think CGC is the best play.  Constellation brands (Corona beer) upped their ownership stake in CGC to over 35% not long ago. 

With a global wine and spirit company investing billions in it, I'm placing my bets on that one.

How else will I learn if Sam I Am will ever eat those green eggs and ham? I get that he doesn’t like goats, boats, and foxes, but maybe there is some condition we could fulfill to make him eat them.

History supports this. GM has been an EV company since the 90s and nobody gave a fuck.

looking at the dow all time graph and if we are headed to the Great Depression 2.0 then we haven't even begun the melt up, we still got a couple years of this bull run left.

also the dot com bubble was not that bad, the 08 crash was way worse. boomers are so fucking dramatic.

Growing weed is difficult. Light settings and watering times are a full time job. And you can't learn good growing techniques from google or youtube because the OG cultivators don't share their secrets. That being said, TLRY/APHA focus on edible products, which will be their ticket into mainstream use.
2021 is the year of the bull in China, this can't be a coincidence

If only I had the time, competence and willpower to research what the latest plane crash did to the involved airline and manufacturer stock. It's easier and more profitable to just buy the dip and go for a nap I suppose.
Because Nio did a concert and launched a fashion line

Easily, start investing into new ETFS that will boom.
ARKG, TAN, HACK, ICLN all the good ones. Opt into margin if you haven’t already and the start selling cash secured puts for premium, take that premium and keep putting it into ETFS. Margin will increase as portfolio value does.
Rinse and repeat, don’t even touch those ETFS.

Just don’t be dumb with it, your young and it will compound but buying shitty calls is a sure fire way to lose it.

You got proof of this conjecture?
People who have bought Tesla cars but don’t own TSLA stock: 🤡
Wait, I thought they weren’t a car company, they’re a tech company? Or is it they’re not a car company, they’re an IP company? At least now that they’re just the millennial version of a boomer energy company, we know PEs of 12-20 PE are appropriate.

In our heart of hearts, we all know Tesla isn’s a car company. They’re a bubble company that makes cars.
I mean this is rife territory for unserious jokes but f’real now trickle down economics is obviously complete bullshit and the pendulum is about to swing hard to the left in the US. 

Workers rights in the US are such a fucking joke to the point where it holds back the economy way more than it lowers the barrier to entry for competitors. Basically no paid leave is straight up inhumane and no viable healthcare safety net has got to be the highest barrier for people who want to be entrepreneurs.

Nope. Not at all. I’ve been seeing you whine in the morning threads the past 3 mornings about how you’re not making money on Tesla. so don’t come to me with this shit. Look into Tesla’s deferred software revenue for next year alone it’s going to be 1 billion dollars. Capital B. Keep dreaming though. Dumb fuck.

There is no sarcasm. He is saying that there ard lots if parallels between what trump does and what happens in communist countries with bozo dictators.
So many TSLA tards coping in this thread. TSLA is dead, stop forming emotional attachments to stocks and get out whilst you can. NIO is in charge now.
He’s not a retard he’s an asshole.
Mt all day
Yeah - and I think that’s ok. We’re at a local maxima with the internet - and it’s way more concerning we’ve coupled the notion of a platform and a protocol so tightly. 10 ceos should not be able to deplatform someone (though in this case it’s reducing harm). Brokenness in our government is being solved with brokenness in our tech. Don’t think we should be striving for both to continue.
oh shit nvda gona moon

I think you fail to understand how hard it is to grow weed. Even mass scale producers have to reach out to experts to cultivate good flower.. That being said, the edible industry (gummies, drinks, etc.) is the industry that will be taken over by big corporations like $TLRY/$APHA once it is federally decriminalized. Any futurist knows this and is adding those to their portfolios. Me on the other hand- $9/10 YOLO calls for February, March, and June, placed back in December, all of which are printing already.
Nope. Shows how much you don’t know. It is 100% factual.
No one is arguing with you dumbass 

The problem is if you bought the company at this price... given current profits... it would take 750-800 years to fucking break even 

TSLA is worth less than $100 post split
All music has lost all its luster, I just listen to sounds from an 80s trading room floor now
I somewhat buy into the argument that there is more to companies like Tesla than just selling cars in terms of the tech and software they create to make it happen, and it likely having other applications than consumer vehicles.

That said, just like the dot com, many of these companies will crash and burn in the next 5 years, a few major players will emerge, and we will continue from there.

I think we’re also underestimating existing car companies either building their own tech or acquiring some of these recent companies

glad someone gets it and probably also sees the bigger picture. if everyone would do you as you, or if big money is already in this strategy, that might be how tesla just keeps going up. this might be the main reason for the push beyond $420
Maybe an encore?
So UGLY, it HURTS.. maybe boomers shouldnt design logos anymore

Here's a great summary of NIO day, with all the specs and tech explained. Wccftech is one of the most legit and followed in the tech and EV space - mainstream will piggyback off them.

"NIO, one of the leading EV manufacturers in China, has certainly managed to live up to its hype"

There you have it folks.  🍆💦💦

Jesus tits
so, going from 20 to 60, rocket style, meant a lot of momentum and algo trading on it, which started to sell once the market slowed. against that background, the fact that some 60-70 mil shares (if I remember right) became available Dec 30 for sale meant huge selling pressure. Since it has not broken 22, it seems decent buying interest for now.
Not even close to the same thing. They are stopped by rain lmao those cars limitations are too many to list. Tesla can drive autonomously right now.

I get what you’re saying, and it doesn’t surprise me, I imagine a lot of media will do this. 

But this is their few recommendations each month which they all archive, to show their “performance”, so I don’t exactly see how their few selected picks for the premium subscriptions are scam, if they are the performance they are basically selling their service on

That’s a sketch number. I think 900 FDs are fine. Anything above is risky. But if TSLA continues to do TSLA things, then obviously you’re fine. If you can handle the loss, just hold it.

Why do markets close on weekends. Surely in this day and age there is no need to close them.
The Senate needs 60 votes to pass laws, with a majority they can only pass reconciliatory budgets (e.g. when Republicans reduced the individual mandate penalty to $0, but didn't remove the mandate from the ACA). So there's not a 100% of big bills getting passed without bipartisan support. 

What they have though is control, so they can bring up all the bipartisan bills the house passed over the past 4 years that Mcconnell singlehandedly had blocked. They also could adjust Senate rules so that bills only need a simple majority (aka [the nuclear option](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_option))

TSLA:

Past me is actively trying to kill itself and is inconsolable most of the time. He’s been this way for 8 years, but it’s gotten worse the last ~ year. 

Future me is literally in a hostage negotiation with present me over our sanity and is a fucking Movie comic book supervillain about staying out of TSLA. He’s more crazy than the Joker, more dedicated than ISIS and Al Queda combined, and is more capable than the Allied forces in WWII. 

Present me is being ripped apart on a molecular level from the gravity between both of them.
All I see since yesterday is people talking about TSLA and the market as a whole popping.  Its was definitely different on Monday, but it took a sudden change yesterday.

Given that Tesla's valuation assumes market domination for decades and perfect execution, anything where a competitor has a too good to be true vehicle at a low price is a huge threat to the absurdly bullish Tesla valuation baking in decades of future outperformance.

We're not really talking about what we want to happen, we're talking about what ***did*** happen, which is an election that was decided by 50k votes total between 3 states.

However to answer your question, yes, I do believe the electoral college is valuable and worth keeping.  

We're essentially a union of 50 countries, and the government has to balance the needs of the people who have never seen a tree with the needs of the people who have never seen the ocean, and everyone in between. 

You can't do that when there are enough people who have never seen a tree that all the other votes don't matter, because then you have mob rule and people almost always vote in their own self interest without understanding or considering the needs of others. The current structure is very balanced - it leans Democrat but when people get pissed off at Democrats we get Republican presidents for a term or two, which tends to happen every decade or so.


&nbsp;

One major flaw in the system is that the DNC is allowed to use super-delegates to tilt the results of their primary election, which means unless the party picks one candidate by a landslide it's really a small clique of party leaders that are picking the President. That's a pretty scary concept, a lot scarier than the electoral college imo.

Tesla isn't Walmart or Target. I think you're thinking of legacy auto :P (okay, that's pure opinion.)

The stock comp thing is based on Elon's package, yeah. It's not one-time, but it is a finite number of times ... also, the accounting rules surrounding executive comp are a bit draconian, in my view: that they have to deduct the current valuation of the stock seems a bit strange when you think about it, since it penalizes the company for having a high valuation, and yet the company doesn't spend a cent to provide it (there's opportunity cost, sure, but it's still apples to oranges comparing it to profit and yet GAAP still requires subtracting the apples from the oranges...). But yes, without Elon package Tesla 2020Q3 was profitable pre-credits.

Also, though people pretend otherwise, credits are not one-time either :) The world is still bent on going green.

The competition ... well, we'll see.

I also think Q4 will have good earnings, mainly from margins from huge sales. For Q1... very interesting will be seeing if there ends up being a release of city FSD this quarter, which will unlock an immediate lump-sum of past margin as well as more ongoing margin, especially if it's paired with a release of FSD subscription.

Some people like paying more for less. Grats on your etron but I definitely wouldnt consider anything other than Tesla until these other automakers step up their game. Also as an ex automotive technician I wouldn't buy an Audi.

I get your sentiment, but I wouldn't blame the 737 for this. This one was 26 years old (pretty fucking old), which would most likely mean that poor maintanence (i.e. the airline) was at fault.

The newer 737s (NOT the 737MAX) are some of the safest planes out there.

Sure, people care about range, but only to a certain extent. And it is going to depend on where you live. But people care about build quality too. And how cheap a car is. And some people just don't like the look of a tesla. And because Tesla only has one brand and basically one look, they're screwed on that one.

With that said, I’m not ready to short something with retard strength.
never forget the iconic March EOD pump where he brought CEOs out to his press conference to pump 30 minutes before closing time. good times
“Buy the dip pussies.” 

Actual quote from Warren Buffet.
He’s been shorting tesla and is down huge. Bad shilling skills man
How many times do you think he's heard that?

Yup. Well Friday night. I wouldn't want to go out into the plague ridden world and catch a cold that people don't even know they have.

I’m not saying there won’t be a pullback. Also not calling it a bubble. There’s infinite money to be made with infinite clean energy.
I didn't like your first comment but accepted it as a different opinion. When you replied with:

It proved you were just a name calling child.
I think the deal falls through. Anyway it’s not going to be positive.
In March, not sure which day

Personally, I wouldn't buy one due to fit/finish/service issues.

As much as we meme stocks only go up 1930's was caused because they actually believed it couldnt go down. That combined with the new ability to finance anything gave the temporary illusion that everyone could live a wealth class or two up from what they actually were.
So maybe Burry had the inside line on Nio's tech release and that's why he was brave enough to start shorting Tesla now... hm
This EV bubble is so hilarious. It’s completely identical to the dot-com bubble where investors are 10 years too early to the party. Also anyone with an electric car has a Blink card but only uses their home chargers or free ones.
Have we got a date for that?

They all have the same burn-in issues when you have the same thing showing on the screen for extended period of time.

Everything in a bubble is easy, that doesn't make the comment any smarter.
Libertarians seem to be just anti-authority, and they like how Trump defies everyone and goes against the established powers.
Very very good
I believed that until this week. Now, everyone in here fully agrees it's a bubble and about to pop. If TSLA gets 0.01% red, everyone and their mom will panic sell. It'll be a bloodbath and seems like it's about to happen now.
I’m saying Tesla won’t pop. It’s not going down. I’ve been trading Tesla for a while, this doesn’t feel like the times when it went down. Still plenty of room to go up.

Mainstream media about to go back to COVID 24-7 now that politics are resolving (albeit not done). Partially because coronavirus took a back seat for a bit, but also to shift the narrative given the outrage of some over the censoring. Maybe a good weekly play for vaccines.
I hope your right. This gave me some juicy confirmation bias for my TSLA puts

He has a pretty low IQ, that makes him easy to attack. His supporters then try to validate his non sense with "but he meant it sarcastically" or other excuses regularly. 

A president speaking like that is unfit for office:

"And then I see the disinfectant, where it knocks it out in one minute. And is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning, because you see it gets in the lungs and it does a tremendous number on the lungs, so it’d be interesting to check that, so that you’re going to have to use medical doctors with, but it sounds interesting to me. So, we’ll see, but the whole concept of the light, the way it kills it in one minute. That’s pretty powerful."
What can I help you with, we got some new type of tendies on the menu
Well you take baba at $600 billion and i'll put my nuts on the table with the $11 billion dollar one.
So NIO had a good event or not? I’m confused?
Up and to the right isn’t exponential. It’s not a constant function when you see 100% growth, then 38%, then 25%. That’s a flattening of the curve. Sure, graph looks curvy and up call it exponential if you want since the term gets thrown around, but it isn’t right mathematically (which was my point to begin with not to argue about the look of the graph)
All in December ARKG leaps

Wish I knew! He better move a little quicker though. Right now he has the support of retail investors. You might of seen from the poll here on WSB that we collectively own a larger chunk (5-8%) of GME shares. If he doesn’t become more vocal or doesnt up his stake soon we will move on. His cryptic tweets can only hold our attention for so long. Another thing, if he is working with Melvin to benefit from driving the share price down, he’d be screwing over retail investors. RC could easily say he’s losing interest and threaten to walk away; this would drive the price to $15 and all those Jan 15 puts would print. Retail won’t forget though if he screws us over. He needs to move now.

Like how other car manufacturers start to take market share from Tesla. Because they are. 

And even though the arguments about how tesla has better batteries might be right, imagine how much they'd lose if the other car manufacturers actually catch up.

Catching up is easier than getting ahead.

nio delivered 43728 vehicles in 2020
A Boeing 737-500 just crashed in Indonesia.
Apple and Google both have the right to remove apps from their stores which they believe are inciting violence or being used to organise civil unrest etc. 

These are private companies... They set their own policies.

of course. thex will flood the market with shares. that‘s why i sold all my shares. i will buy again when it crashed

They sold 7k in Dec alone, aiming for 120k production capacity in 2021.
I switch to Schwab and enjoy it, no fractional shares though. They have their own things with “slices” but its not the same. You could always just keep you RH account open too
What time does nio day start
Nio has lidar, tesla has camera,
NIO has Baas and chargers , tesla has chargers only
NIO has Adam

Current car sales is not the ultimate thing. How you see both companies in 10 yrs. That's what matters.
I'm sure many people absolutely care about range; heck, it's the main reason I've heard anecdotally for people passing on an EV in favor of a hybrid! And Model 3 LR sells very well.

(And conversely, by "compromise on price" I mean they have to charge too much, like Taycan.)

Interesting point about the price war ... I guess it's possible for VW to attempt to pull an uber and sell cars at a crazy loss for years to bankrupt Tesla. But, that's only feasible if the prices are relatively close; it'll be very interesting to see what Tesla's cheaper model looks like.
Nothing is priced in, only retard keep saying this line.
> I often wonder what it must be like to have that kind of work ethic

Trump was famous for his work ethic too. Supposedly he only sleeps 3 hours a night. I wonder if Elon does something similar
Why is everyone ignoring that he said in a bubble. The entire idea is it's easy in a bubble like this. Look at tesla's value.

The rise in low quality jobs is a good thing?
For those asking if NIO news is good for LI and XPEV, I think that the best news is the battery, which would probably be made by CATL, so likely would become available for LI and XPEV at some point too.

25% chance to be up and running with autonomous within 2 to 3 years. What a joke. Even if they had autonomous cars right now it would take more than that many years for laws to change so they'll even be allowed on the road without drivers.
It's just a social cue to signal other primates that they are idiots.
No, I’m just as lost
It's easy. They cannot fathom that their god like emporer has lost the election and that there are people who aren't as deep in the fascist cult as them, so the only logical conclusion they arrive to is the election must have been rigged.
They are still operating at a loss, even though it is narrowing, also they sell roughly 1/10th of what Tesla sells

So you are saying Tesla to 5 trill EYO🤡!?

You underestimate that wealth inequality is also an issue in China, lots of lower income ppl dragging down the average. But a small percentage of higher middle class that can afford NIO, that’s already a bigger market than the US. Not to say, ppl are invested in China’s growth, those who can’t afford it now, will be able to in 3-5 years, so there will be increasing demand yoy. That’s why China is the biggest market.

Tldr TSLA has a significantly larger market atm. If NIO was globally scaled like TSLA, then you’d be right. It’s much more bad for LI and XPEV than it is for TSLA. It’s definitely good for TSLA, and experienced/big shareholders know that.
And your #1 mistake is assuming that the Chinese market is of total communism nature, though I agree that the ccp has a certain extent of control over the Chinese market, China’s has had a capitalism market for over a few decades now, it is the very reason you’re seeing all these new Chinese companies sprouting out and they’re doing pretty well it seems. Point is though I agree that there’s poverty in China, they’re only the minority, the majority middle class person in China is growing and they’re getting richer and if they can afford to buy all those apartments in New York, you bet they can afford a car
Honestly as moderate left, feel like this is good (both in the short term because I think the risks are real and long term because I’m now convinced 230 should be repealed).

Look Fb/Twitter and co are clearly moderating their content - and it’s reasonable for them to need to do that. But it means they shouldn’t also get a free pass. 

We should be building and open sourcing the social graph so alternatives can be built and break the pseudo monopoly. Will that mean the next demagogue might have a harder-to-censor platform their on? Maybe - but it also makes the liability and regulations clearer, vs just being the decision of <10 CEOs
Yeah saw that, no idea who he his but boomers will listen and be calling their brokers on Monday
Can NIO be a 500 billion market cap company this year? How far off is their production output compared to TSLA? What are their margins compared to TSLA?
ok pleb

Except NIO now has LiDAR, which has a far better data accuracy when it comes to e.g. road conditions. Moreover, China has thousand km’s of highways as well and a LOT of traffic. This race has only just begun

Are you expecting the market to be rational? 

Lol...
No. A single plane goes missing randomly shouldn't effect the stock that much if at all. Everyone freaks out over the dumbest news on the weekend.
I just want ARK to buy NIO now. If they are still not buying, they are blind.
I think so, next week is fb law suit settlement. They owe blackberry probably billions.

We already got it, billionaire investor says tesla will triple
That’s a much more complex one to answer. I have no clue. If I had a gun to my head and had to pick, I’d say more bad than good for now. The only reason it’s good for TSLA is because TSLA has the advantage of being worldwide and much higher scaled at the moment. TSLA can take and learn from NIO to develop similar or better products quickly. Which they will, and investors know that.

LI and XPEV are under pressure, as they have to compete with NIO only for now. All 3 of these Chinese companies to my knowledge are in the works of expanding outside China, but since it’s not done yet, xpev and li are under pressure being behind in the same and only market

The TSLA bulls are idiots. They ignore the competition and are way too early to the show. The whole 2000-2001 bubble and crash was because investors were 10 years too early. Legit and certified self-driving trucks are 10 years from now and it assumes Tesla will have a monopoly in the tech.

Grow into what? Already told you they are valued at 40% market share right now. That's ridiculous considering the biggest automaker only controls 10. There's only so many cars you can sell. Even if you include the fact they gobbled solar city, and are dishing out solar panels still doesn't justify valuations.

It’s okay man, if it makes you feel better I sold my 1/22 44C’s I got awhile back so I could make more fast and put back into NIO. I lost 75% and now all I got are my 1/15 50C’s

Ok, but imagine if Tesla replaced VW.. why is it valued at multiples of VW and Toyota combined?

And all the bullshit about oh but self driving.. or Major disruptor in the energy market.. Yeah, you really think that Tesla who already almost went bankrupt scaling up the model 3 is going to disrupt multiple industries at the same time? Especially now that other car companies just waited for Tesla to roll out the mind switch for people to start driving electric, all they have to do now is make electric cars. Tesla did the marketing for EVs for them. They'll be laughing all the way to the bank.
Then buy after the news and sell at the bottom

As humans evolved to stand up, women’s hips shifted and became smaller in comparison to other apes, as larger hips were a disadvantage to standing. As a result, birth evolved to be significantly shorter than before (more developed babies are larger and harder to birth) causing the babies to be premature in comparison to other animals. As a result, tribes were necessary to take care of these babies. While other animals are birthed and then walk, run, and eat right away... human babies were incapable of doing that. Now, nearly 2 million years later, if you call another human on Twitter a different pronoun, you are banned and shunned from a community that gave you some sort of social relevance/satisfaction. So, next time you’re banned from Twitter or Reddit. Don’t blame the liberals or conservatives... blame those bitches with small ass hips that caused social order to be so important in our lives

It’s not. TSLA has a much bigger market (for now) as NIO is China only at the moment. TSLA has expanded to over 40 countries. The way these industries work, they follow each other while also constantly strive to do better. Just because NIO surpassed TSLA in a few technological aspects, does not mean TSLA is out of the game. Investors know that TSLA will catch up to speed very quickly, and very possibly announce something better later on. When one company in the industry announces something good, it generally helps most, if not all the others.

You don’t have to believe me. You can either research yourself or set a remind me for Monday. Just watch the market Monday. If NIO goes up, so will TSLA.
Let’s play a guessing game. I’ll start. I think it’s going to be a minority stake in red bull. 🚀🚀🚀

SELL THE NIO NEWS? 🤡🤡🤡🤣🌚
A liability is... anything you are liable for. If I show up to the Fed with five one dollar bills and say "Give me a five dollar bill" the Fed must give me a five dollar bill. Obviously this is not how this plays out, but you get what I mean. 

The money is fiat therefore the value is intrinsic, yes, but it's still a claim on value. If my bank account says "1,000 USD" that means the Fed has promised me 1,000 physical USD will be there whenever I want it. 

It's the same issue that led to the removal of the gold peg and started the whole gold peg deal. During the gold rush, banks realized they could issue notes instead of gold. They gave these notes to miners showing that ____ Note was worth ____ ounces of gold. This allowed the banks to "give out" more gold than they owned. It's called **Fractional Reserve Banking**. 

FRB lets banks do more, faster... It's akin to trading with margin. You can instantly reuse your cash even though it has not settled. TD Ameritrade or Robinhood spots you the cash so you can go create more tendies sooner rather than later. The faster you can access those sweet sweet TSLA gains, the faster you can make more. Likewise, the more money banks can lend out, the money they can make in return. This is all held in check by the reserve requirements set by the Fed. They try to keep banks from getting leveraged to the tits, but they do it anyways. 

So, the USD is a liability to the Fed because they're on the hook for every dollar (Digital and physical) in the US economy. They must be able to pay out or exchange these notes for the desired note. If China liquidated all of its bond holdings, the Fed is liable to push those dollars out of the unrealized space and into the economy. 

**The Treasury creates the dollars, the Fed gives them life and manages them.**

Bonds are assets to the Fed because they're purchased with dollars. They hold onto these assets and can liquidate or accrue more depending on financial conditions. It's supposed to be a slow and steady policy... Not 4 trillion in 6 months, but that's off topic. The bonds the Fed owns are locked up dollars, which allows them to control the flow of cash. When the Fed buys a bond they don't pay anyone for it, they promise to pay them at maturity. 

Bond yields are a mess. The run isn't just because bonds are down. Bonds have been trending up with stocks for awhile now. Usually the credit and equity (Bond/stock) markets inverse, but not during a bubble. 

So, yes, you have the right idea. Bonds are assets largely due to the fact that the Fed can control them. 

I guess you should change your name to AtLeast_competent

Boeing 737 that crashed into sea in Indonesia is not a MAX Model.   


Flight data charts show short departure from expected flight path then near vertical descent at very high speed into sea. Debris scatter suggests plane was intact till impact. No distress or problem call before accident.

I think there's issues both ways. Government is inefficient, but "I don't trust the government to spend my money effectively" is a convenient excuse to pay less taxes, especially when a lot of these billionaires are in a position to lobby government to spend the taxes in a more responsible way.
yeah i know, that is true.

Don’t be too demanded. Let’s make it $1,000 first
The second NIO day stopped all the bots turned off.
It didnt break down the 220 bottom support with all the news about being delisted, Jack missing etc. Outlook is amazing, current value is a steal. Im very comfortable holding my position to atleast 270.
I didn’t notice any mistakes. But yeah, I think what’s causing TSLA to be so high is sex appeal... it’s priced in as if everyone in the world has a TSLA
Actually, impeachment would be in GOPs interest, because while he could certainly not get elected again, he could still probably win the Republican nomination.  Now, there might be some way for the gop leadership to prevent it that I don't know about.
NIO is going to fucking moon Monday. This was not a sell the news event. NIO flexed all over TSLA today
its fake dumbass
Tesla's market share is declining in Europe.
Invest in AAPL. Don’t be dumb. Thank me later
Prayers to the people. But this was an old ass plane in a country known for shit maintenance. BA had a 3% dip after the last major crash (with a newer model). Should just be a short term overreaction. 

Kind of disgusted that I'm talking about this when people have perished. 

Welp.

Oh, these are dollarydoos? I thought you meant it was real money.
Don’t worry musk daddy

I’ll never let go ❤️
Watching some old videos of Musk almost in tears describing the blood, sweat sleepless nights that went into building Tesla (and SpaceX) and making the companies successful. 

I often wonder what it must be like to have that kind of work ethic, not because you want to get rich, but because you genuinely want to better humanity and advance it.
Lmao, unfortunately it has self driving 😂
Nah never reported or downvoted just dont wanna hear the political shit on here anymore. Mods alrdy told u fuckers to crawl back to r/politics

Battery as a service.  You don't pay for battery upfront but instead lease it monthly...I think $150 a month.  You can also swap them out at the swap stations and switch from 70 to 100 or 150kWh for a month if you want and pay the new monthly price
This is the way
The math isn't hard lol. The graphs are obviously exponential.

I really don't know how to dumb it down for you. Honest question, do you really think this is linear growth?
What’s the NIO news
he didnt, its fake dumbass
They're shrinking in Europe. They're not growing. please explain.
And honestly, being in China is bullish af. Asians are terrible drivers and will constantly crash them, making the need for more NIOs constant
Rip
Typically Boeing, as usual.
Fine I’ll buy more lmao
For now yes. What is more important is, is that it shows that tesla does not have a technological leadership (especially for batteries) and other companies can overtake them rather quickly.

Sorry for some mistakes. English is not my native language.
Oh so you’re the snitch. Good to know you leak fluids out your vagina
Right. This will push him to do something better

Rejecting everything is just a vote for the status quo. Just like somebody who says "I hate all investments" is really just cash gang.

Cash gang is an investment. It doesn't make you outside the system or better than the system. Hating politics is politics in the same way.

NIO day should push up all EV stocks. TSLA to $1,200
What he's saying is "Different people have different interests to me, so they shouldn't be able to vote because I don't like it".

Essentially what he wants is the illusion of democracy and freedom, but a system that only benefits him.

Possibly. I feel like stimmy talks drive a lot of the market but also feel like they’re so back and forth that it’s hard for me to tell if it’s a big cause. I’m unsure.

Yeah but aren’t they only in China?
Yuck I prefer the old logo
> or have to compromise on range/price

Customers don't care. That's what everyone who remains so insanely bullish on Tesla doesn't seem to get. It doesn't matter. All the reasons mentioned about how Tesla has better tech, Tesla has better range bla bla bla.. It does not matter. Customers do not buy a car just because it has the highest range.

And if anything, Volkswagen and Toyota will be able to last way way way longer in a price war. Tesla is now able to sell stock for some money because everyone is still hyped. Imagine them selling stock 'because otherwise we lose sales' . Everyone will want to get out.
Gains are priority - everything else falls inline once those are secured! The jiggly booty is a metaphor for another high risk stock trying to get your attention =)

I think they're just scared people will realize that Biden barely squeaked out a win against a guy that's on blast 24/7, not good optics for their team when even the propaganda doesn't work. 

Plus with only 50k votes making the difference you get back into sticky questions about voter fraud actually making a difference and they don't want to talk about that. I mean with that slim of a margin it could even be all the felon voting laws they changed the last couple years that swung it.
Why worry about impeachment, if he’s so bad, how could he possibly get enough votes in four years to be elected?  Can’t understand current politics or politicians.

China's economic growth doesn't end up in the populations it's mostly controlled by the government. Capitalism vs. Communism. Your #1 mistake is pretending the Chinese economy is anything like the Western economies. 

The average household income in China is less that $10k USD per year. That means the average Chinese person could save every penny for 6 years and still not afford a Nio.

What's a market cap?
What makes it an off-brand Tesla. Because it is an ev sedan? So no one else can make an ev sedan without it being a rip off of Tesla.  This is like saying a Silverado or Tundra is an off-brand F-150
For fucks sake, what level math are you on? What’s y=2x? Exponential means doubling repeatedly, not just consistently increasing. It was exponential in 2015, 2018 and nobody gave a fook
Bad. NIO just took a fat shit on TSLA tech and coming from a price standpoint is cheaper for autonomous driving than TSLA
Longterm good, shortterm bad. Competition is good and will likely set a fire under Elons ass to do better and make a better product.
No one cares about your genes passing. Just because evolution wired us into having sex for survival, doesn't mean we have to abide by it's rules. Once you dead, you really dead.

So, in the Netherlands. Tesla sold 30878 cars in 2019. Car sales went down a bit in 2020, of course, so you'd be ok with tesla selling a bit less.. Guess how much?

Yep, in 2020 tesla sold a STAGGERING 8956 cars in the Netherlands. 

Oh, you know that little car companay called volkswagen? Yeah, they sold 47386 cars total in 2019 just on the VW brand (not counting audi, skoda, porsche...). Tesla came close. And in 2020, they sold 44970 cars.. hmmm Something doesn't seem to add up. 

Let's see.. Volkswagen ID.3 10954 sold in 2020, ID.4, 2408 sold just in December. 

Audi e-tron 3764 sold in 2020,  porsche taycan 434 sold in 2020.

Hyundai KONA 10823 sold in 2020, up from 7071.

YEAH TESLA IS DOING AMAZING!

That $1.2k USD. I'm sure that'll buy a ton of NIO's.
Market is forward looking. At some point, when the market expects that QE will end in the future, that could be your catalyst for a correction - less monetary easing, rates start going up (10 year is already starting to creep up), downward pain causing retail investors to try to all head for the exits making it a bigger downward spiral

Watch Morgan Stanley come out next week and raise their PT for Tesla. Those fuckers went into Tesla recently after missing the fomo rally to $420 (post split)
I got a mix of LEAPs, synthetics, and covered calls. Time is on my side, but the thing about IBKR is that last 10% of margin you're only allowed to daytrade with. So I just sell an OTM SPY put credit spread three times a week. Since the S&P is green 53% of the time, and the direction of market is more often than not clear by mid morning, I earn a modest reliable profit over both long and short term.
Is this how we trade now? Toyotas?

Google is a permanent-hold stock. Think about how much they know about the world and how frequently they are used. Frictionless. They are already massively embedded in the economy.

The only thing about the car i don't like is that LiDAR sensor on the top, design-wise. But it's integrated decently, and especially in black it's not that noticable.
One, that is after 20 years. I don't think a majority of the retail investors buying Tesla today have that type of time investment horizon, much less patience

I think TSLAs tech, brand recognition and overall hype in the hot EV market are so far ahead of its competitors at the moment. It will be very hard to keep this advantage for long though against bigger companies. Once the EV market gets saturated and their tech comes back to the field it will be interesting if they maintain their market cap. Musk is very creative though and can see him branching out the company to different areas like apple has done so if EV turns out a bust I predict them to be more diversified than other EV companies

if fiat currency was finite... any rise in indices means money is going into the market and less to someone else... so if money is cheap, which it is right now, and in effect we are creating more money, asset prices have to go up, as for "inflation"... the easiest way to acheieve it wage stagnation, higher unemployment and higher taxes... many alternatives to acheive the same end goal... bc of this the play is industrials specifically industrial metals...copper
When you realize you’re not holding enough NIO 🥴
That actually makes it more dangerous now. Speed of trading is orders of magnitude faster now than it was in 2000. Which means movements down will be much more violent - flash crashes, etc. Don't believe in the fallacy that just because we have stocks on an app that retail investors will be able to protect their downside by exiting trades faster
Nah.
Why you cant figure out why the broker did it was because the broker didnt do it lmao
Case in point
Absolutely not lmao 

Electrical components are the main reason cars depreciate so fast 

The most advanced and electrical plagued cars (think Mercedes, bmw, Audi) all depreciate the quickest 

Add to the fact that the actual power train (the battery) is now a consumable object that looses range each month.. 

Depreciation will hit even harder

Agreed, long ways away but to me it seems that worst case a battery swap 50 years down the line could revive the lifetime of the car in general. Obv there’s still other deteriorating parts but overall that’s the main focus of the ev itself

It'll need replacing after a year or two with how much the screen will be on, so either they figured out some type of amoled that's better than any phone on the market or they want people to buy a new car every 2 years
You know when I was seeing that BS cnn 350 price target by EOY I thought they were crazy. Now.....now I think they might be on to something.
As someone who loves NIO ty for this post. Now take my awards you fucking cretin! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
$80-$100
TSLA opening at 900 Monday
Resident Evil!! this is the best game oh mannn
wait do you think this is linear lmaooo. And you're looking at last 5 years. Compare it to 2012-2020, that's how you really see the exponentail growth. Here's the link so it's easy for you.

Wym?  China loves Tesla
The only way
That’s what I thought Friday but now I don’t know. That range is insane. A person with an average driving habit could go weeks on a single charge.
Yeah all those institutions and ETFs that track the S&P will dump TSLA for NIO....total sense
70 IMO

They have a max 10% rule. They are forced to sell Tesla stocks whenever it climbs vertically to keep their portfolio balanced
Underrated comment :D
Yes, because eventually (when I'm dead) there won't be gas cars. We're phasing over.
The "news that isnt ripe with lies or conspiracy theories" was claiming that Russia had a piss tape of Trump for 3 years and people like racheal Maddow were doing the Charlie from always sunny meme. Excuse me for not believing it.
all these wage slaves... i now understand why they’re excited for the weekend. i hate weekends that’s when my biggest income generator isn’t working. 🥺
150kwh for 1000km
You need some milk 🥛
These bans are the culmination of a 'free market'. Freedom for the few.
1000 km is the 150kwh battery. They only showed price with 70kwh and 100kwh battery. So the 150kwh battery seems like won't be here til 2022 or later
You clearly missed the singing
EV stonks only go up
i dont think so. they announced too many unexpected things.. it's crazy most of it never leaked.
This is the way
Wi Tu Hi
Tesla cars will not have AI in as elon is afraid of it, therefore your Tesla won't try and kill you if you accidentally scratch it or are rude to it. TSLA TO THE MOON
Off-Brand is like a national identity.
Nio on monday  🚀
Yes. Millionaire in few years
I forgot about the auto park, that looked smooth af
What kind of father would tell.his son to sell TSLA??
Now be done sir
Aiming for 6 digits this year. It’s a fools game but I will get there with dedication and stupid luck.
nio price target by end of week?
Overall do you think down the road overall value of ev’s will hold better than gas guzzlers when it comes to resell?
All I see is GEI
They’re fuckin immune bro
Last I checked China didn't give two flying fucks about its middle and lower class, they still get paid pennies. They cant even afford afford 3 wheeled electric buggys let alone a Nio.
Should I sell right when the market opens or wait??
[deleted]
I FELL ASLEEP AND NEVER GOT TO BUY MY 2022 TSLA $200 PUTS 😭😭😭


NIO calls it is
But how much of the actual trade volume is retail? If institutionals just hold, they won't affect the price, won't they?
I mean, because exporting cars has never happened in the history ever
I'm hype for the stonk but these are off-brand Teslas, and I'm pretty sure even Chinese know that
Puts on $thot
Her only fans isnt paying my tendies
Better than politics.
jesus
[deleted]
They'll know how much you've made once you move out. Tell mom you don't need her to make you chicken tendies anymore, you make your own tendies now.
only like 9k people were watching this on youtube. NIO will rocket for sure but its not gonna affect TSLA at all. If you are bullish on either you are good
Just remember; Tesla is NOT a car company.  
Its an energy distribution company with a transport arm.  
Plenty of room for growth.
They just convincingly captured 95% of the ev sedan market in China
>FLEX TECH

whats that
This just in, Elons Twitter account can print money.
The rumors weren’t predicting anything like this so no. NIO 100 EoW
This is probably the 100th bitch on his dick that day from the tendies he prints
So desensitized to pussy, this could be one of you boyos once you print made tendies with tsla and NIO TO THE FUCKING MOOON
Why are you assuming a 5:1 stock split if he said the pre split ipo and current prices for his calculatio
I really hope this is a legit question. It made me smile.
Finally a smart investor that sees what’s happening. Tesla isn’t going anywhere, they’re only going to grow more as they continue to get into energy.
1.4, your rounding error is greater than all of US population
Chinese Elon needs some time to chill after single-handedly killing all of their competitors with that presentation just now
So. This concert of 40k+ people is in the country where the pandemic started? We fucking suck.
wut? they announced new battery 150kwh which will be available next year. and they did announce improved baas - bigger capacity
This singer is just making me more bullish on NIO
Bro give me referral code pls
Missed the start of NIO, are the new car and solid state battery coming together or is solid state in the future pipeline as well as the 1000km range? Also is the 1000km range in the 100kwh battery?
You forgot the power of memes
Man now I have to care about Tesla’s situation bc I trade SPY.. not sure how NIO’s achievement rn will affect TSLA if at all tho. Or maybe I should just hedge SPY with NIO calls bc TSLA basically runs SPY now with its increasing marketcap smh
China has 1.5 billion people ... think about that buddy
So, San Marino is the key market for vehicles?
With you. ever heard of a Chinese 4-wheeler/Mx bike they are junk can’t even get replacement parts
He met them as they were also working behind the Wendy’s
What NIO shown today is the sign of Tesla sliding.
Feel like Monday is a good day to sell my 1000 shares of nio and leap call it all.
I wish I was in China rn partying at NIO day rocking to this bad ass
X for Doubt
In San Marino cars ride people to work.
 The People's Republic of China has the largest fleet of motor vehicles in the world, with 360 million motor vehicles in June 2020 including 270 million cars,[\[1\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_vehicles_per_capita#cite_note-gasgoo-1) and in 2009 became the world's largest new car market as well.[\[2\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_vehicles_per_capita#cite_note-2)[\[3\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_vehicles_per_capita#cite_note-3) In 2011, a total of 80 million cars and commercial vehicles were built, led by China, with 18.4 million motor vehicles manufactured.[\[4\]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_vehicles_per_capita#cite_note-4)

It's called growth retard
Just woke up we the headlines that an Indonesian Boeing was lost with 62 people. And to think that 2021 has just barely begun. Simply cannot catch a break. Sigh...
Yea i treat it like a game i play with thousands though 
I look at the percentage not the actual money gained
*whom* am i talking to

It’s... smaller by unit total? I’m not sure I follow

On the contrary I think any NIO profits come to Tesla lol.
winner winner chicken dinner
they deffo know about it and justify the shit design as subliminal messaging that they're connected to the environment
I stand corrected
China has 1 billion or something people. NIO
Elon has a lot of serious investors following and a lot of amateurs. He said that, they all put the name in the search engine, find a company that's a legit investment if nothing else. It only takes a few diamond hand investors to raise stock prices by throttling the supply.

High Frequency Traders (HFT) use supercomputers to predict stock movements using technicals and activity and analyzing headlines and market news articles to place thousands of trades per second. They see this, they all push buy, creating a self fullfilling prophecy.
Sees one interview with smart people becomes autistic. Look at the numbers https://www.statista.com/statistics/502208/tesla-quarterly-vehicle-deliveries/... then look up the mathematical definition of exponential. You’ll learn something...
I mean, the teaser-pictures that Nio had in their app doesn't look like this car. They could maybe show a prototype of another Sedan (coupe)
Wait so they sell video games? I have $20k in a video game store?

#cohentakethewheel 🚀💎👊🏻👊🏻
Oh is it, was expecting them to announce rockets powering battery with how things was going just now😅
[deleted]
Don't you guys think it will be a sell the news eith NIO
(i ain't trying to be a gay bear, just asking)
I will guarantee in 20 years time. NIO hasn't even got 1/5 of the market share of any of those companies
He's sort nio, or retarded.
When are we penetrating the lucrative San Marino market??? 🤡
Actually it was founded in 2014
Source please.
I didnt assert 50 cases were rejected on no evidence. Trumps lawyers did not bring 50 cases. And barely any cases were rejected for evidence it was most standing and procedural shit. You made the false claim and yoir asking me for sources(
This is what got me bigly
Dude looks like the Asian Eminem
 China junk car
Were you expecting to surprise you with 200Kwh?
NIO & NIU
“According to early pre-order data for PlayStation 5, the Digital Edition takes less than 1 per cent of the total pre-orders. This suggests that stock for the Digital Edition is very low or that players simply don't want system with no drive.”

When the sentiment for digital vs. Fysical has changed 180 degrees... thats when I will have my concerns... until then long live daddy Cohen.
Fuck you. I wish I didn’t click 🤦‍♂️Gross
He got one right, can he predict another? Bubbles always pop for different reasons, last time it was due to complexity that no one quite understood. But that isn't what's happening here, tesla is just the top momentum stock, and does have a clear presence and future direction. I can see it trading flat for a year more than it dropping.
Imagine Jeff reclaiming his throne by buying Tesla options
Why not?
this is not the top...it will not end well we know that but this is not the top
I agree it may be to much given the backlash. His Twitter ban will definitely push the GOP base farther away since they’re so upset about censorship.

However it makes sense. Advocating violence has always been #1 rule for censorship and after shit the other day there’s no way they can sit idly sit by (any longer) and just let everyone say everything is fake.

What’s more scary to me is the great number of people that aren’t interested in learning/reading or ingesting any type of information/news that isn’t ripe with lies or conspiracy theories.
NIU day will be bigger

ICE are Gonna be spit roasted by Tesla and Nio!! Nice logo GM LOL 🤡
Ppl saying tsla will tank monday are scaring me, i thought we were just getting ready for earnings :/
TSLA tech is too outdated imo 🌈🤡

Yall making fun of this until steven rark myan starts saying that signal will print billions in the future!

Hm that's interesting. What if they started from birth? That's interesting.
Announced in Nov.  150 was what was expected.
Hey real talk though: when GME does go out of business (because it will) can we all be dumb fucks again like we did with Hertz ? Because no joke I made helllllaaaaaaa money off that. I want that again. 
Let’s do it boys.
Wtf he was doing 3 songs right? How long has this been going on now?
Was gonna ask if it's weird I'd stick n stir that... then I saw the comments from you degenerates n now know yes... yes it is, but least I'm not alone.
add in NIO
Enough downward momentum will start a crash for Tesla. But you'll need dramatic numbers like 40% drop in 1 day like QS did
You still haven't given any sources for any of your shit you just say "dnc talking points" or "bullshit" you are literally the failures of the public school system personified
That’s a big Ooof on that switch. That is an ugly ass logo.
1000kWh battery. 620mile range for the sedan ET7, battery swap station 2.0 auto park into stations, 8mp cameras, LiDAR, BaaS, LVL 4 self-driving, etc
Surely there can't be more announcements...like factories in europe or something...my balls are empty
They’ve won. 

Also, 1000km range, solid state battery, $58k car with $200 subscription to a 100kwh battery (or $78k for the car and battery one off), mad super computer capable of 1016TOPS which is better than “7 Tesla FSD computers” (not my words), sedan with a drag coefficient lower than the model S and autonomous driving subscription for ~$105 a month using better tech than the $10,000 full Autopilot package Tesla charge
$50 bet that by February 28th 2k stimmy has been approved by the house/senate/executive?
GET THE FUCK OUT! No wonder that shit made NIO double last year for NIO day. God I love this company. The fact that Jim Cramer said only to trust Baba when it comes to Chinese companies and not talk ab NIO is criminal. Maybe now he’ll finally realize now that NIO is about to absolutely murder Tesla with they’re FLEX TECH and new FLEX MOBILE
Tesla isn’t just a car company.
You sir are a true retard
Well, you always Buydip now, so red days be gone
**Tsla call holder:**  You said nobody else would possess this technology for 20 years. Well, guess what? Somebody else had it yesterday. It’s not theoretical anymore. Are you listening to me? Are you okay? 

**Elon:**   *\[Gets out the car. And falls.\]*
1k battery isn’t new ?

I’ve gotten used to the 3 day weekend now, at least that means this weekend will go quickly.
Feels like trump fanboys are the same people that try to short Tesla every week
[deleted]
Man BA is effing my portfolio. I was about to get some leaps too. Guess I might wait a little while longer.
Agree that it makes no sense. That's exactly why I wouldn't short it, coz it's defying logic
r/sounding
Yea shouldnt it be 12k% gain
Where do you get your bullshit from? Kimmel or colbert?
Nothing revolutionary in my view.  More computing power, raised cameras, same battery.  Cost effective LIDAR is nice but not eniugh in my view
Perhaps i missed something but not groundbreaking which is what we need to maintain valuation.
Happy to be corrected, am long calls.
Luckily sold my 15jans near the friday hi.

Hopefully this isnt over, nothing on a new battery or improved BaaS.  These were expected and priced in.
Has there been news?
Cope
Read that wrong btw, but yes, I agree, nio looks very promising
Why the fuck would you put an AMOLED screen in a car??
stop having it be closed
Tesla to NIO here comes my money
[removed]
Yeah Tesla has been in existence since 2003 and reaches approximately 76,230 deliveries in 2016. Nio started out in 2014 and are now delivering 40k. These guys are massively ramping up production is my guess...
That would mean a lot in a few years when the price hits $1000 ;)
Funda ... what? I’ve never heard of this term used here.
This just in: Jeff pesos shorting the shit out of Tesla to claim the throne back
I know its not much , only 250 shares, now I own like 2000 average price $20. But I am super proud of this , probably thanks to WSB but no clue where I found NIO from 

[NIO $5](https://i.imgur.com/TNYa9mp.png)
Just wait till Elon releases his new beat on Solar Day
The WSB autist app. I need this in my life. What does baby trader sound like anyway?
Nothing TSLA is on the clock
Uh other than the Great Leap Forward and Cultural Revolution, others are either exaggerated or straight up lies.
I think they have multi-platinum Grammy winning country music artist Brad Paisley on the horn for next year
Noob question - where to find NIO / TSLA weekend live trading stock prices, if there are any?
Ho Lee Fuk
fr they think everything is linear
In short: nio to the moon

Solid State Battery, Lidar, Adam Super Computing, Autonomous driving.

ET7 is the GOAT car.
Damn you are fucking weak as fuck.
You missed Jack Ma driving the car onto stage.
New car coming q1 2022
I'm holding onto some shares of Ocugen. Sold last week at peak for 100% profit in a week on shares. Hoping to get another 100%
Search nio channel on YouTube quick to see its live event
The announcements are over tho
LiDAR AND an 8MP camera
TSLA had an exponential growth... Look at Elon's interview with Cathie. Maybe you'll learn a couple things
Funniest shit to see people on subs talking about how 5% Twitter stock drop is “the people responding”. One dude was like yeah, that’s bad and telling.  Have you been living under a rock the past 10 months lol... people out there w their mcds money acting like they are investors.
Waiting for that stimulus check to hit
in their spot the dude was screaming at his wife so the daughter puts the mask on and now this guy wants everyone to sing just why
“Hold your calls, i promise they will be in the money next week. Buy more shares they will moon , we will moon together “
Better quality than Tesla, checkmate
Yeah and not mile long panel gaps lmao. This shits on an S class or 7 series for pricing. Everything is standard here and half the price.

The crazy thing to me is how innovative we get with tech in such short time, I love it and who knows what’s next
[removed]
I thought I was retarded.
Or crashes from share dilution.
Lol I bought into a 3x long Tesla etf Friday. Luckily my NIO shares should offset whatever happens there
What is their new hoax? Your inserting covid into that. It could refer to a variety of things.
You'll change your mind EOW.
no,  they (vw benz bmw etc.) just exchange combustions engine with electric engines on the same chassis and tryhard some futuristic design. it looks like a parody if they have one mega futuristic looking EV besides their huge line up of regular cars. whereas NIO or TSLA is something else, a concept for itself. its another product of car and innovation.
Looks Chinese
I picture Will Ferrell saying that to some GM marketing team
Can someone hit me with a quick Nio recap
Agreed
Yes but we're all retards together.
Well then you have 58 minutes to get your hands on a beer.
This right here.
Watch elon announce a stock split this weekend just to fuck with NIO 😆
Open the market
Eh id hit that too
Someone help me summarize the key points:

\- With 150 kw/h battery the new car can drive over 1000km. No other EV is on this level right? It's also solid state battery!

\- New battery station 2.0 can service more vehicles faster

\- New computing system powered by NVIDIA is 7 times more powerful than Tesla's? Did i hear that right?

\- LiDAR sensor takes the safety of autonomous driving two levels higher

\- Price is under 60k with BaaS?

What did i miss?
Im just waiting for the colony to establish a stock exchange so we can by FDs from mars companies ;)

Stocks are not options here sir
I got Covid, lost 15 pounds in 3 days, had a migraine for a week, a fever of 103, and now I have to take an inhaler 6 times a day along with a slew of other drugs.
Honestly just on styling alone it beats everything tesla has put out. Coupled with the performance.. it's a no brainier.
People in US can't comprehend exponential growth, its how covid got so bad...
This guy passionately singing to our NIO calls
This guy deserves a grammy just for this performance.
fantastic job taking way solid profits!  grats man!
10t. Aim high
And I have only 35 shares
TSLA call holders sounding very insecure right now with skinny bitch NIO singing its heart out right now. And tbh, you should be afraid. TSLA is bloated as fuck and I'm gonna bet alot of people gonna take their profit and reinvest in NIO for the cheaper run up that's about to happen
9k people watching this online and I swear 1/2 of them are in here
NIO in made-in-china copycat junk. Change my mind
Yeah bro they are gonna be in like every Fkin car

No really ban him, 130 to 170 is a weak pctg

Yeah i guess - competition is good though, right? 😅
serious question:  does Bezos have a glass eye?

follow up question:  how do deep fakes deal with glass eyes?
That’s got to hurt man damn! I’m only in shares and I halved my position a while ago with the expectation to jump back in. Feel like I shouldn’t have taken it out but here we are, maybe my 9 shares will print me something in the coming years
[deleted]
Nice of Nio to put on a singing performance mid presentation now after totally blowing all of their competitors out of the water just now, it’s like they’re having a pity on other ev makers lmao
Yeah but for a reason 2.0 stations can do 3x the amount of swaps.

1.4 billions of which like 10% can actually afford a car.
NIO was founded in 2018. Tesla in 2008. It took Tesla 12 years to get to 500,000 deliveries and NIO has 40,000/y in two.
Is down $209k the lowest we have seen this trade go?
For real man, what about your money and risk management? 😅

Audience chats, concert, karaoke TV, incredible tech unveil.

NIO HYPE HYPE HYPE
That's the ticket.

Well that’s kinda what i’m saying. They’ll both focus on their own markets and both be successful. Tesla isnt going anywhere just because of NIO
Sup heathens I’d like to remind you it’s 7:25 am. No excuses for anyone who hasn’t already started drinking.
Damn I forgot about that

Still going to load on calls though
holy fuck
Bro I would buy this with the quickness if it was in Canada.
Great now Elons going to sing next release
Until NIO expands further globally...not a chance friend. Elon is The Godfather. Perhaps LI can hold the flashlight though.
Could be, the Hyundai to Honda, I get it. Way to early to tell but the tech their selling looks amazing
Place is packed.
It's exponential growth smh. Look at when TSLA first started
Regardless of your “side” the mass collective bans of GOP politicians from social media platforms and the potential for google and apple to remove Parler is downright scary and unprecedented.

And that’s coming for years as these platforms have allowed middle eastern despots, Chinese officials, Islamic radical groups, and others to use their platforms with impunity for things much worse. 

The perceived benefit of this will be far less than the absolute negative energy and distrust nearly half the country will now have and also trigger the true fringe leading to horrible shit like Oklahoma City. 

/end of rant
NIO 75 EOD
They haven't looked in the trunk yet, there's still time
Looks very good to me...
But who knows? I'm a fucking retard
Yes, the NAD system is fully autonomous driving with LIDAR.  Best in class range with 1000km for the new sedan on the 150kwh Solid State Battery. And power swaps will be fully auto.
No, Elon said it was too expensive

Definitely. The 7.1 sound system was pretty cash money too.
RIP 1/13 145C.
Not vito, but scrap prices are up 75% since the previous quarter. They will destroy.
I’m crying 🤣
Yea I see Tesla’s decision back when LIDAR was expensive but now Apple have it on their phones and now NIO have it on their competing cars. Surely it’s a matter of time now to switch. 

(Also not claiming that Apple’s LIDAR is any way suitable for cars or autonomous driving, just that they’ve miniaturised it and made it affordable enough to be put it on the back of a phone)
Did you not see the first singing? Dam you missed out
They can do it anytime they want, and Elon never said when they would. Way I figure is each time they break a record they'll cash in a little.
Lol ok bud. Enjoy your bubble.
Where the *fuck* do you get this info from
Nah not this event.  Too much upside...they have announced a number of truly historic things. I wish I had short dated calls for this honestly.
Omg nio
First which goes truly self driving will win the race. Why? Because then animals can use them too and that’s a massive untapped market.
Does Tesla have lidar?

Thats ok i sold my 50c 1/15 2 weeks ago. Seems like nio just getting started tho.
I don't help those who are beyond help. You're beyond worthless.
They did.
on which stock exchange? are you from the future?
Nio and Tesla might just be the Samsung and Apple of the 20's
No all good. Really great news.
Idk about circuit breaker but def a noticeable dip, the next couple of months overall will be interesting to say the least
Dump all those and buy NIO leaps
If NIO brought out jack Ma 😳
I have 600 shares of NIO at $20 and a $55 call option for 2/15. 

I'm happy but wish I was more leveraged into NIO's butthole

Not a bot brah, just too excited
You are literally retarded lol.
who cares about a market of 330 million when you have a market of 1.4 billion to focus on lol
Somebody post the pasta of Chinese no no words that kicks everyone from China out.
Well it’s true after this Nio day Tesla is on the clock
Why margin?
NIO dominating the Chinese market already is enough of a headache for TSLA even if somehow it never comes to the US
This company made and delivered 40k cars last year. Pull your wet panties back up people this is embarrassing
100% Bro, soft close doors and acoustic glass is something you get on 150k cars as standard.
Is this good for NIO?
I’m just leaving this here: 

“According to early pre-order data for PlayStation 5, the Digital Edition takes less than 1 per cent of the total pre-orders. This suggests that stock for the Digital Edition is very low or that players simply don't want system with no drive.”

We all know the ps5 sold out like porn magazines on a pirate ship (including digital versions), but you wont get a clearer message from peoples sentiment towards digital vs. Disc.
That’s dumb as fuck. LQD has such little movement you might as well call it a mutual fund. Inverse whatever the fuck this guy says
Which market is bigger?

Yes - originally one of Tesla's main concern with LIDAR was cost and accuracy. But it seems like both of these have been addressed with the comparable selling price and the high quality of images compared to the light cameras during the presentation
2 days ago: NIO Chinese scam ain’t shit, luck in 2.0, they delivered 7k cars last month!

Now: OMG NIO, RIP TESZLA

Y’all wildin lol.
Daddy Li taking us to Mars... before Elon
So it’s a dip to buy like every other dip ever
Yes it’s a sell the news event but hot dam they’re great longterm
For real
lmao his song was good
It's relatively cheap for all that you get. I'm assuming they'll recoup most of the money through the ongoing subscription services. It's genius in the sense that modern cars last longer than ever and there's no real need to replace them. Being locked into their ecosystem for life is a great alternative for the company.

TLDR see you fuck boys on the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I think you will be! Good luck!
Thanks predictions for Monday? Was there any bad news
I kept my position and hoping for another two +10% days. Who knows it could be even more judging by how the whole market is reacting to senate news on energy stocks.

On Friday you could tell from the candles that bears were trying to push the price below 53 but the stock eventually closed higher which is a good sign. There's also more bullish volume than bearish.
Make fun of me for taking out my 43C’s 3 weeks ago to try and double it to put more back into nio just to lose almost all of that. I’m only left with 50C’s now. Regret and a clown 🤡🤡
RIOT, MARA AND ARBKF TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
So glad I picked up some Nio puts. This thing will drill to the core on Monday.
They had Bruno Mars last year I think😂😂
Going back in on NIO now. Make 130% a few months back when I sold. Time for 200%. $150 by summer
What did you put 1 dollar into it?
Some poor indonesians in exchange for put   tendies.
Tesla def got their work cut out for them, Nio should be a direct competitor very soon. I honestly think all the hype with Tesla has to do with other factors primarily the spacex program so until that ipo’s on its own in 10 years or whenever, Tesla will not go away. In other word btfd lol
Trojan horse
Everyone saying “rip tesla”. How long til NIO is delivering within the US? How long will it take them to have the infrastructure that Tesla has in the US? NIO will absolutely destroy China markets but i think TSLA will have the upperhand in US.
Im pretty sure that the Chinese government can make it look like he was.

There's whole academic studies tied to showing how irrelevant that marginal statistic is. It is found that voter sentiment and investor sentiment are correlated. Reasons include:

1. Stats do not account for actual policies in effect.

2. Stats do not account for partisan control over Congress, SCOTUS, and state governments.

3. Most policy effecting the market directly is NOT made by elected officials, but by independent bureaucracies (aka The Fed). It's set up this way to prevent the very meddling you describe as before the Great Depression well intentioned but naive elected officials tried to artificially boost growth.

4. You could just as easily argue that one adminstration's stats could reflect the effects of the last admin. I'm not arguing this, but you could.

5. Stats reflect averages over decades, not days as in the post.

6. Party politics evolve with the decades. The parties you see today were not the same as the ones a century ago.

7. The POTUS cannot do anything of consequence to the economy via executive order. There's a whole list of committees and professions involved.

8. The SEC isn't micromanaged, fortunately. If they introduce or remove a rule there is unlikely to be any elected involvement.

9. Politics divide us down the middle. News that will make some push sell will make a roughly equal number push buy.

Now, there is something in the way a lot of people THINK politics is important. For instance, my weed calls look great because the industry mooned after the Runoff Election. The reason is Dems now have marginal control over Congress. This makes no logical sense, as even deeply partisan issues like Healthcare never divide perfectly on party lines. More important, weed isn't even a partisan issue!
The NIO day singer is actually......not bad. My god I feel bad to all those people who thought NIO day was just going to be “an announcement”. It’s. A full on fucking CONCERT going on here
Europoor 1pm, gonna buy a lot of cows thanks to nio
It is majestic as fuck bro. This guy is feeling it
Elon crying in Grimes' lap right now
Nah, Elon crying in Grimes' lap right now
NIOs autonomous driving is ~$105 a month. It’d take you 7 years to match the cost of Tesla’s Full Autopilot package they charge $10,000 for. And NIO has a fucking LIDAR. I’m shaken and stirred and wish I’d bought more NIO
First this new model. Now they bring this fucking legend of a singer. This guy alone will pump  the stock to $100 EOD monday. What even is this shit? FUCCKKKKKK

I will give you tinier but the motors are same on the platform. Kona got released earlier so may have had more teething issues but now both are using the same motor. Niro gives up range for the extra space and weight. I prefer range over space.
Tesla is just trying to sell more cars. NIO wants to own the EV Market.

What makes this not the next rkt?
$NIO opening price come Monday and EOW predictions?
Looks like I’m seeing a perfect cup and handle forming
70k 100kwh without baas I thinj
I don’t know about the rest of you but I’ll never set foot in a 737 again. Will check wi5h airlines before booking that it’s not one of these death traps.
If I was Elon I’d just sell Tesla and retire and just ride around on jet skis with my friends everyday. You’ve already won richest man in the world, literally what else is there to accomplish
When did you buy them? Looks like months ago
damn, i was hoping nothing groundbreaking would've come out. sold some 2/19 80 cc at eod yesterday

oh well at least i'll make some money before it gets called away

That was not a perfect conversation. They tried anything. They tried it over and over. They’d been doing it since you got in. It’s all turning. They lost. It’s all turning. Think of it. Think of it. And this is their new hoax."

AAPL doesnt do manufacturing - not for phones and definitely not for cars. Its a design and marketing shop like Fisker. Contract manufacturing is well understood by the Supply Chain guys at Apple
Hope you guys bought the 7% dip on Wednesday

So how's Nio day going
YouTube Inthemoney
balls deep in NIO, but there is no way this car is affordable unless its made in Xingiang.
It's lunch here in Europe so maybe it's mostly EU watching?
Pricing is at about US$80k, comparable to the Tesla Model S hmmm
Even the best make mistakes sometimes. Part of being human. Admit you’re wong you stubborn tard.
Might be Tuesday.. or Wednesday or just whenever you're not looking
It's literally what Elon's stated mission was: To make EV's a thing.  It's happening.
in your reality anything can be true I guess. What a jello

Tesla in the mud, nio going to Mars 🚀🚀
That's the best part, haha.
Can’t believe I’m bagholding this shit
Im just gonna buy more nio when market opens. To the mooooooon🚀🐍
Tesla is completely built on hype and fomo right now. If elon came out with some news this weekend price would skyrocket again.
Just try to get cheaper stuff.  Vale is still good unless it pops big. 6/18 30c on MT is still gonna be under 150 at 117 now.  Might be a good play i got a couple.
Fuck Monday is gonna be a mad one
I join the Nio gang! Quick newbie question for options: my broker offers open end turbos with super low knock out - 12 dollar. Isn’t it a low Braunes that Nio will not fall underneath that? If so, isn’t that „gifted“ money or what am I getting wrong?

just to let you know that many Dem voters feel the same. But equating authoritarianism to corporate sell outs like Pelosi and Biden really isn’t a justified comparison.

Progressive policies are medicare for all, green energy, heavily subsidized/free higher education. It goes on and on. The worst part is that corporate sell-outs will stand in the way of getting anything done.
Similar story here guys thank you so much
West Coast 4am here i just love NIO
[removed]
puts are gonna print even if premarket is red, people are going to line up to get out, besides, its already falling for over a month now, it strengthens the trend
NIO is a 1T company. No doubt.
I get the vibe this was not the full story
There is no realistic amount of preorders that can justify TSLA’s current valuation
why would they?  competition is baked into the equation.
2022? I want it now!
OUR CALLS GONNA PRINT

Thank you.
Yes even saying he has increased his position
If she didn’t, my brain would have imploded from processing.
Which is stupid, because it's only hip startups and Tesla that are getting pumped. But big car manufacturers who are actually starting to sell EVs are completely under the radar.

Where is the bump in stock price of volkswagen?
[removed]
Imagine thinking Tesla is worth 800 billion when a Chinese startup can outdo their tech in a couple of years.
talking about “getting pussy”. Nah let’s talk about some BS personality types and how it makes it hard for me to talk to girls 😭
FUCKKKKKKKKKKK $58,374.77USD for 100kWh, with BaaS
506000RMB = 78,000 USD for the 100kw version with battery
I thought of doing that the other day while on the freeway and thought naw, like a sane person.
78k usd wif baas
I'M PREORDERING
I don’t doubt that Tesla will remain #1 in US. But my god NIO is going to SHIT all over Tesla in China. It’s not even gonna be funny.
My guess is $80k w/ 3.5k subsidy and 10k baas reduction option
Like in poker
RIP BA Call holders, ba plane gone missing in Indonesia today
PUTS ON QUANTUMSCAPE!
I rode it from from 20 to 55. Took all the profits and left my original investment in. Spent the profits on more tsla, which subsequently mooned, now thinking I will move it back to NIO for even more gains. Or just get some calls idk yet. I was honestly expecting a let down and dip to buy back in on.
Either way you want to be in it.
Think no one saw this coming man, gap up Monday more likely
What is that in usd?!
Firstrade
I think this is bullish for tsla
Just wait to see what happens Monday morning.  MT is the lagger atm with earnings next month so try to get a good price there.
Thanks!

Oh man NIO will rocket QCOM and NVIDIA as well. Just compared it to TSLA fsd lol
this is literally the best meme in the history of memes, maybe ever. days after seeing it for the first time i still think back to it and it makes me chuckle.
I wouldn’t be surprised

It’s live on nio day 2020 now search it up on YouTube
Competition is good for business. Elon is more about progressing technology and making quality products than he is for the money so i bet he’s not too mad. But if he was smart he’d announce preorder numbers for the new tesla car or something to show investors it’s worth still investing in.
NIO straight up FLEXING on Tesla’s tech rn. NIO wants blood my god.

You're right, he didn't call it a conspiracy. He called it a hoax. Stable genius move right there.

Yeah right, but we are not omnipotent. Otherwise, why don’t we just rely on our natural immune response in the covid19 outbreak? The rate of success is too low in some cases, and that’s that’s deadly enough. How many do you want to sacrifice to achieve “herd immunity?”

If Elon was smart, he’d come out with something exciting this weekend to combat the NIO hype.
pretty good job? He did one if the worst jobs at dealing with this pandemic. Have you even noticed skyrocketing cases? It has been off this dudes radar since June-July. He doesn’t give a fuck about it and he doesn’t give a fuck about the 3k-4k americans dying every day from it

low energy comment
I've been pulled over in several states. It's always license, registration, AND proof of insurance. Some states will give you a pass on insurance because they have electronic systems to lookup insurance for their own residents.


Honestly surprised to explain this to multiple wsb users, but then I think about PRPL and I'm not so surprised any more.

Nio day to much to watch literally, gets better by the second
ok you convinced me I'm buying Monday
[removed]
It's the beginning of a major commodity boom. The last commodity boom went from 2001 to 2008. In 2008 steel prices tanked. One day these companies could be way overvalued (exorbitant P/E ratios, too much speculation and volatility) just like TSLA is now. But that will be several years from now, with a tech-induced stock crash sometime between now and then.
[removed]
What alternate platform though
How is it possible I’m having FOMO when I’m already IN NIO?! More more I should have put more in more
Lidar though.  Oof.  Elon says no bueno.

God damn this thread sucks. I have nio. You have nio, everyone has nio. Stfu about it
They don't, they're too busy actually making money selling cars.
“Gullible_State” hahah dude he said it was just like a normal cold. Suggested injecting disenfectant to fight the virus. Refused to make any type of national plan (still no plan to this day). He rallied against mask and made it a political issues. As he said “It is what it is”
People tend to possess a short memory span. In the din and bustle who said what will be forgotten and all people will remember is the grandstanding gestures and how well they spoke in the last session etc.
Only 3? That's like the bare minimum: one in the house, one in the car, the one burried in the yard. 
That doesn't even leave you a daily carry piece, yet alone a backup.

GOP can't benefit from Mango man when half still support him and half condemn him like the democrats
Calls on China fucking hell
Yes and 1,000 km
Nice Nio looks like it is at Level 4 Autonomous Driving - need to hear the specific details
[removed]
Exactly this is a sell the news event we’ll get great opportunity to buy in Monday before liftoff
They’re killing it rn on nio day
1000+km 150w battery!
TSLA needs to buy NIO now, before it's too late.

Musk, if your reading this, strap the NIO car to your rocket and aim it for the sun, this will establish dominance.
It’s a little different now because people all over the world are trading instantaneously in n their phones vs in 1999 it was literally only banks through primitive dial up systems and retail through phone lines with brokers. 

But we truly don’t know when I agree with that
NIO AUTONOMOUS DRIVING  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀  🚀🚀🚀
#GG
In 3
But he *is* that passionate about idiots adoring and giving him money.
Yes
Biden is a creep. Trump is a retard. We deserve better.
My account is 100 percent nio. I am crying rn
Peep the lidar scanners on the roof...let's hear about that autonomous goodness Master Li!
Nio too strong
AMEN brother! I love BFT when the paysafe merger goes through and I see this as a $40-50 stock in the next 6 months and closer to $100 over the next 2 years.
Feels good being in NIO
Did you just see what Nio brought out?
more passionate about having a brain-washed mob ready to do his bidding
NIO is gonna be a trillion dollar Company in 5 years
Why is everyone selling TSLA?
Only 200
And /u/throwaway_jim119 can absolutely afford his cake, cuz it's his cake day.
But statistically they would also both be gay then, so it works out..?
Hope no one owns shares in Boeing...another 737 just crashed
Walk softly and carry a big stick.
Guys, I got laid last night. Is something I will one day say
What if my EV gains are offset by my PLTR bags?
Son of bitch
I don’t know how to tell my kids dad won’t be home. HE IS GOING TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Fuck I should have bought more NIO
LET ME IN NIOOOO
Based on everyone talking about Nio in here I’m going to sell at open and buy the dip
Damn should do that in a TSLA like in wolf of Wall Street bets scene
He just say the seats are massage chairs? Lmao
You’ll be thankful come Monday
I'll be right over.
Sorry to hear that. Friend bought HD and Lowe’s at the beginning on this pandemic and was raking in huge dividends before he sold. I bought into ACB as reports were coming out earlier this year about staying at home, stress, and how vices tend to be a good investment during recessions. (Beer and liquor sales are up) but that shit tanked. I should’ve  researched more as they were underperforming in basically every aspect. I feel your pain
When does market open??? I need to buy Nio!!! Son of bitch, all in
Coming from the same people that gave us coronavirus
NIO ET7 has a drag coefficient of .01 lower than a TSLA model S
1000km in the ET7 what the fuck
NIO calls and Tesla puts monday
This...Iran gonna have the last dance
Sitting next to your mum atm
This is insane
We just need Elon Musk to tweet 'Gamestop'
Never take financial advice from someone without at least 3 rockets
7.1.4 sound system. Damn this new NIO car is a need
Agreed throw Mara in there too
Trump shouldn't have cucked and should've arrested the Clintons.
Lol
Rotation from tsla into Nio
Holy shit I regret halving my NIO position now
I agree I’m grabbing leap calls Monday
Big corps can easily pay compliance cuz they’re big like compliance is a small % of revenue, and they can just raise cash on this low rates.

Small businesses don’t have access to low rates, and they have to put collateral.
Losing it on potential gains is more painful than losing real money lol
Could be, but I'd back the guy putting astronauts in space and landing 71 rockets myself.
This man just said the car has its own AI, voice recognition system. What In fuck are they doing over there in China lmfao
OK. Address?
IM DOWN 30% BUT IM NOT SELLING!!!!

Plz tell me this bitch nomi can speak English soon.. Plzzz.
Tesla puts? Is this socially accepted yet?
Yup, NIO’s gonna beat TSLA at its own game

Well. The next logical step is Trump making his own party now. But I'm not sure if he is that passionate about politics.
Yeah Champion honestly peaked already. The make some dope sweats and shit but they're never going to be nike or Adidas. Plus hanes as a brand encompasses much more than champion but it's a lot of socks and underwear. Steady market for that shit, no doubt, but never going to pop off unless wsb beats off into enough socks to cause a world sock shortage...
fuk! should've gone all in on Nio yesterday!
NIO bringing solid state battery. QS will go down for sure.
Drive reckless when young. Noted.
Omg glass roof that's beautiful
god damn thats shit
Damn Mic drop by Willy Li. Nio to 1,000 EoY 🚀🚀🚀
WTF I fucking sold Nio on Friday please kill me
Loading up on some NIO calls monday. idc if it sells off at open or not. this going to 100 by March
Here's a reminder that Nio was only founded in late 2014 - still very impressed at their progress thus far
He didn't call it a conspiracy though. He had a daily briefing for months and started warpspeed and a bunch of other shit.
See BA...any of you think joe won’t prop it up living in alt. reality
Hahahahahaha
ET7 is looking very 🍉
Yeah this is better than I expected
nio up+40% AH
It's the law.
He’s only got two tweets up right now. That’s strange.
HOOLLYYY FUCK NIO!  RIP TSLA it sucks to say I'm a major TSLA Boner haver.
NIO’s still sucking after I came... ahhhhhhh
Why you paper hand your NIO CALL BEFORE NIO DAYY 

Fuckk mannnnn
Nah you pretty much nailed it. 

There are some good YouTube videos out there by Project Option that explain how to do them.

Sub is now filled with r/all, it started on summer when everyone basically opened an RH account
Didn’t need a lockdown, if he had just acknowledged the virus was a problem and provided direction ( instead of calling a conspiracy) he would have been re-elected easily.
Obligatory, however also ironic

🚀🚀🚀
Why
[deleted]
NIO just hit 100 on the Zootopia exchange. 🚀🚀🚀
Even before March last year the market had been on a nearly 10 year bull run and fed still was lax on raising rates because they were worried about "growth" then Covid/March happened and they pulled out all the stops. So its pretty clear a pullback is too scary to even think about. It might be a recession or bubble burst.. fed wont chance it
This beats Elong's sciency nerd powerpoint presentation....
it’s a casino if you’re unsure.

it’s an atm when you are.
Nio?
That car is better looking than any of Tesla’s not gonna lie
Oh God I'm going to fucjing kill myself I panic sold feb 5 NIO 60 calls on Wednesday on that massive red candle FUCK FUCK FUCK
It's like /pol/ found one
He never said "bleach" but yeah that was a slip up. Hydroxychloroquine and zinc does work as a treatment in fact europe used it while we banned it based on a bad study. I guess the gay mask thing might have worked idk. The media hysteria around it there was nothing he could have done imo. He actually did a pretty good job with it considering.
Nio is gonna gap up to 65 Monday
Quit horsing around
Never
Reface
[removed]
Fuck I feel like an idiot now for thinking $58 was too high
Calls at open, all fucking INNNNNNNNN
I might buy NIO calls for the first time Monday
We should on behalf of the lives lost due to this shit company and their airplanes
China cooked Jack Ma in a soup
I hope my nio shares offset my BA shares. Why do I even have BA shares again?
Maybe he is right? Maybe this is just a bubble
Nio day escalated from live band and movie to  announcing 900+km battery life real quick lol
NIO ET7 awesome
Means... They aren't watching Nio day on that flight.
What about 1400? 

Also, Imagine betting that interest rates stay at 0% for a decade and that there is no competition for a decade. For reference, Elon musk has only been CEO of tesla for 13 years.
Puts on $TWTR. 

Expect a bloodbath on Monday now that Twitter has lost their golden goose.
Puts if its not already -20% + in pre-market already.
The market is going to love this
Show all time pussy

I WANT THAT CAR
Fuck man should’ve bought NIO calls, NIO def mooning on Monday
Fellow kiwi.

Fuck you.
[removed]
Yes, puts on BA
I'm jelly.
Holy shit nio
it's not about corruption, government can't spend money efficiently, if they could there would be no need for private markets.  When government does something the cost increases over time of that certain thing, look at healthcare, education,...
$TSLA battery density is currently around 260Wh/kg. $NIO now has 360Wh/kg. That’s a 38% higher density than the $TSLA battery
Na no way man, he would have been blasted as an insane fascist. He started warpspeed, did a press conference every day, gave military aid to states. Kept supply chains moving for food and shit. Let governers deal with it there way. He did what the president of a federalist system should do.  He just had the media against him 24/7 saying hiw bad he did. Youbcant lockdown the US Chinese style thats fucked.
Boeing 737 went missing 30 minutes after it took off in Indonesia, and you know what that means.
BA puts are the new meme boys. 

Can we meme this shit to a literal penny stock?

That’s why it’s called vulture capital
Holy fuck 600+ mile range. Highest of any ev battery

Well fuck, maybe I underestimated nio lmao
Solid state battery and 1000+ range this year and the swap stop!
Nio wtffff
I'm sorry how much does lockdown cost? How much is your health worth? The price of a vaccine is very low in comparison.
Just another reason on why the Tesla run is so overdone.
NIO gap up incoming
Another Boeing plane gone. Rip
Nio
i think like 99% of everything ever is covered by that
yup dot com bubble took 4 years
Washed
620 MILE RANGE HOLY FUUUCK NIO
Holy shit yes
I'd be up about 5 and 3/64 inches
1000km per charge, that's good right?
1000km+ on new battery?????? Wtf
No you retard, low interest rates leading to inflated asset prices doesn't mean there isn't a bubble. Low interest rates have historically been a contributing factor to previous market bubbles ffs.
NIO TO $1000 🚀
Solid state battery, 1000km+ wtf
620mile range!!!!
I'm calling bullshit. He doesn't even know where the dollar sign goes.
NIO is gonna skyrocket to 70 or something on Monday
Your mother's dildo.
Please let us know what you find!

This nio day really be putting tsla’s fucking battery day to shame..

150kWh battery with solid state tech 🍆💦💦
What trading software is this?
Wasn't the max.
Idk about you guys but I really want some NIO gear to rock in 2021 and as I grab a call or two come monday.
Solid state battery too?!? That’s it, NIO to $100 Monday
Huh source?
I do see a buy more button, why are you waiting ?
Erm, they've contributed massively to mathematics and sciences over the millinia, bollywood if that's your thing, and if you don't rate their food then fuck right off.
Damn that’s near straight down at 90 degrees lmao
lol at downvotes for a purely factual explanation of how slim the margins really were. Damn, dems are ***salty*** today.
Maybe not a federal mandatory lockdown but just not saying silly/ridiculous stuff about taking bleach, taking malaria drugs for covid, and always saying “China virus”. Also if he had worn a mask that could’ve helped with moderate voters.
Massive Tesla sell off in Pluto. We are fucked
I had it and literally didn't even notice it...
tsla to 69 ✔

tsla to 420 ✔

tsla to 420.69 ✔

tsla to over 9000 ⌛ please wait
Problem is, playing calls on TSLA will work until it doesnt. Many of the retards here will be bagholders because they cant pull out their dicks.
[deleted]
Time to sell, and then short Tesla.
Absolutely should of did it the same way India and a China did, we were too dainty with it timed with the planes being grounded just like 911, but nobody from fauci et al...bothered with it...shitshow that is USA
[removed]
Do I pay for insurance or do I inves... Yolo it on calls? Hmmmm
I'm out and not watching it but I'm reading a lot of "Nio is a lifestyle" comments. They are laying it on thick because that's their mission statement. The first paragraph of their prospectus is about their vision of their products being a way of life.

1.5millions battery swaps...v2 automated swap stations with auto parking!
Nio are killing it right now are u watching this??
Swap station 2.0!!! With auto park into stations

Cool. Keep being a prick .
It’s going to take a while to track everyone involved. But there is evidence coming out that some people were from different factions. Antifa, Blm, who knows what else...only issue is it’s always disputed as conspiracy. It’s strange how conspiracy’s somehow always find a way in the future of becoming fact or at the very least often times, it’s not far off. Ya know? One things for sure Yuri Benzmenov had it right, the best way to destroy a country is to dilute the media with so much false information that one cannot determine the truth anymore. And the truth becomes what media and government says it is. It’s a sad year in American history

NIO POINTS WOAH
Blue paint plan nio is dope.

1000 eow
Ohhhhh that makes sense, so it was from Forex trading.  Because I’m mathematic major and there are only small number of stocks you could have chosen as your starter to be ahead of me.

To get margin, you’ll need $2000 which is 666.666~% from your first position $300 and seeing your previous posts with NIO, it wasn’t possible because NIO was already at $20 40 days ago which I flipped and sold at $50.

My first position was $FCEL at $2 then with winning I purchased $10 OTM calls which hit for 20 contracts, then $NIO 20-50 flip then YOLO’d on BNGO.

[My current position](https://imgur.com/a/6JkzUY1)
Imagine (some) people in the western world only finding out now that all the elections are rigged anyways haha.
BLUE SKY COMING
Feeling GREAT, but I won't stop there. Next target is $300k.
Boeing 737-500 not max. Shits priced in
LOL Blueberry and Kodak says hi
I can’t buy on my platform but I would have because ARK have been buying it up this week
Still have PTSD from battery day, fuck that
He said he's not going to the inauguration, which Twitter considered may be  him signaling that it's OK to attack Biden in inauguration.

Another tweet was him saying he got 75M votes, but that he didn't win, but his supporters are heard. Which Twitter also took offense to.

Twitter down 4% after hours

What happened to that guy btw

Jump onto the Gigachad gang. You won't regret it
Yup, the whole EV sector is a bubble similar to .com. That being said I think Burry might be too early on this one. So I will enjoy the absurd growth of Tesla and Nio while it lasts.
[This is how I feel about Tesla, but I’m too poor to do anything about it](https://youtu.be/jwRgkZmKpV4)
I'm not really into options. I started trading around US elections and traded DJIA, that's how I made first 5k. Sold those to buy TSLA and started YOLOing. Currently holding around 300 TSLA shares (paid 20% margin)
Gigachad gang where we at!
Buy and hold on here?  Wsb unlikely.  Wish stock hold ten years for a 10 bagger.  187th most popular website.  No debt. Close to profitability. Worldwide reach and millions of daily users. Buy, hold, be a meme.
Fkkkkkk my 200 ba shares won’t like

Chinese Elon is out, hold on tight boys, entertainment is over, the real nio day has only just begun 🚀🚀🚀
I’m european and I’m hoping the fucking 2k passes. I get my tendies, I can cover them on forex for now, and when the market pops and the euro starts going Brrr, i just need to close my coverage and rake on that euro inflation 💸💸💸💸
when i look in William Li eyes i am full of faith for NIO. $120 EOY
they follow the chinese calendar, chinese new year hasnt occured yet
Chinese New Year?
I would wait for close. If it tanks premarket then IV will spike and you’ll get crushed out of the gate
Btw how does it feel? To have a spare $100k huh
My man! Cheers pal!
NIO with a flag on Mars, challenge will be accepted by Musk!
chinese new year starts in february
Months old porno, already priced in (I think its the reason tesla got into the s&p)
That’s what I was thinking. Too bad he doubled down on ignoring covid otherwise he would’ve swept the nation. I knew a good amount of Dems/liberals before the pandemic who had given him credit for the economy and were even willing to vote for him till covid hit
Bought 500 for retirement.
What do you think?
Can’t wait to see people cry on Monday when NIO sky rockets because of NIO day, and they sold Friday instead of holding thinking it was a “sElL tHE nEWs” 😂
Wow NIO donated to help them fight Covid. If only US corporations weren’t so greedy and wanted to help
Parallel worlds. So angry... If there was even a slight indication of fraud it should be looked into. Irrespective of the fraud or situation. Is that really too much to ask for buddy?
... no, I'm old and my hearing's getting worse (LOTS of punk rock shows) so I will go through all this hassle (and time... it takes FOREVER) and spend hard earned tendies to make range time a little less loud.
First human contact with aliens: "You guys got puts on BA don't u?"
800% is damn nice, starting amount doesnt matter.
WSB is seriously the cocaine of the internet. It feels great while you’re doing it, and there’s no better feeling than putting your head down and blasting a green line straight to the dome. The problem starts when you run out of money, you’re vision turns red, and you develop the shakes while becoming so desperate that you buy FD’s just in the hope you can feel normal again. 

The last week for GMEgang seems that everyone else in the party got sold some of that pure diesel from Medellín and you’re over here with some bunk shit shaken out of a hood rat behind the dumpster of a Circle K that you bestie promised you was FiRE. 

Well kids, Monday is when we learn to cook it down and freebase. 

All of y’all that were fucking soldiers this past week? We are winning the war. The enemy is on their heels. This is no time to let up. The next 3-6 months is our wet season. All those seeds we planted gonna need water, and RC is about to make it rain up in this bitch.

Shit someone beat me to it
“Everyone is a genius in a bull market” 😂
But why exactly? What’s the matter with a pullback?
Gonna explode like my dick on Monday open
TSLA and DJIA mostly
NIO has stuffed bulls walking around. Bull toys. I know it's for CNY but red bull must mean 🚀🚀🚀 in china.
the movie's a bull flag - it shows Nio's made so much money they can make a pointless movie about nothing
yeah, they'll dump it in pre-market anyway.
I didn't expect subtitles on this, that's great
Lol how’s it looking
Options trading is your life now. I'm at work at 6:30 am reading up on BA and how much puts are going to be worth at open on Monday.
[deleted]
No they will not. What other airlines has had anything like this occur? BA might be going to 0.
I don't remember exactly, but I guess it was AUD 1 contract of DJIA. (Margin was around 0.25%)
Me either man, seriously or like in Cast Away.
Why am I up at 5:30 watching a live stream of NIO day
Goodnight. Go to sleep degenerates.. 😴
To all those who are dreaming of shorting ba on monday, it will be priced in
[removed]
I literally made 80K in FB and the next week lost 80K on a fucking gap-down open on BA. Fucking worst feeling ever, should have just thrown it at fucking ARK or bought a Patek instead.
Wasn’t he fixing ACs?
The question is not "will my puts print", the question is "how many tendies will I get if it hits 0"
Chinese papa we love you
I think that’s more directed at Commie Harris. You know, the person that will take over when Biden dies of old age or dementia
That’s awesome yeah airlines just seem like free money if you got in when they were at their lowest.
Why is it called “NIO Day 2020”?
Agreed for life
Tesla ended this week with 860 in after hours. Do you think it will go down or up?
Lmao other CEOs rock suits but NIO CEO rocks some kind of Gucci shirt man thats wild   gonna buy more Nio on monday
I find it pretty entertaining tbh

Chinese Musk is here!!
Karpachu is just giving us access to more shares to buy before lockup ends

So eerie how we have data showing the plane dropped 10,000+ feet in a minute...
Nobody in this country really wants to fight. If they did things would be much different. Nobody volunteering to end up as a notch on a belt anymore.
Chill man it hasn’t even started, currently they are only showing live performances and movie for entertainment, announcements will come later relax
im not stepping on any boeing plane anymore
Can they please find Jack Ma this weekend I need BABA to pump to 260 monday
No body can
i’m gonna need some proof that this exists
You’re a hypocrite
Great TEDtalk
Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised if this affected the airline industry as a whole sector. I don't think it hit mainstream news yet but I'm sure it will. You're right, not again already with another crash.
ban
I knew I’d see the most retarded comments possible if i opened this thread, I wasn’t wrong
The only good thing going for Boeing is they have all weekend to get out in front of this. If the market was opening today they’d be fucked. It won’t be as bad on Monday.
The front of the NIO SUV really looks great tbh

How does NIO stream via YouTube in the first place? I thought Google services were blocked in China
I grabbed a call 🤡

Ba is going to 0
With Boeing, probably heard it bout a month back 😭
bruh u still talking about vaccines? it‘s 2021🤣
No one ever went broke taking profits 

But having 🧻👋 sucks
Oh Jeeze I’m late to the news, damn BA might be done for.
Oh yes
It's not a stock, its a messaging app
The quality of voters would sure increase; the average land owner is more fiscally minded
Oh I agree. Having to be or become a billionaire to be a candidate in an election, undisclosed donations, cooperate sellouts etc. 

And most of all only two parties, both of them deeply broken and divided. Non of them are especially conservative or democratic. It’s only in the name. 

So yes, politics are crooked.

But I don’t think there was widespread election fraud that changed the outcome to Biden’s benefit and without it it had been a landslide for Trump (as he claims).  If anything there is a whole lot of voter suppression from the other side and it’s getting more prevalent every year. 

I’d much more prefer a parliamentary democracy with a 5% threshold than a presidential system. It would refreshen the debates and take out the reality show factor a bit.
Uhm what the f is this NIO livestream?
This is just the ramp up folks...wait until that shimmering ET7 comes rolling out and William Li starts unleashing all the specs on us...
Lmfaoo that’s hilarious watch is sell off Monday sell the news event it seems
Apparently this is standard practice for events like this? I’m pretty sure this is going to make the stock moon lmao

Nio's gotta spend our money on something right? might as well be that movie they did
Maybe, even after shitreon predict its value at 20 it still didnt go under 22 but we never know 🤔
NIO day...not NIO 90min my man
If we used that money for public healthcare + education then yes. A small business not paying out healthcare insurance for their employees + less time training and dealing with liabilities thanks to a more educated and less accident prone workforce. And I already said in the first post the ULTRA wealthy, small businesses would not be affected dramatically.
BA is now dead. You cannot come back from this as a airline company. Hope everyone enjoyed em
It's not just a car-company
can they just start with the cars and tech shit. Fk all the commercials
Thinking with the boeing crash and the twitterning, Monday might be a great dip buying day

Nio's gotta spend our money somehow
Unless they're causing other people to jump aboard the train, they can't singlehandedly increase the stock price and profit from it as well

Based on the information provided losing 10 ft in altitude in a min and losing connection from flight control tower, It seems highly likely sadly. BA bull Shamble.

It’s not bad at all but so far it has zero to do with NIO or cars at all. They definitely went all out though lmao.

I’m literally having deja vu right now, some Reddit user from another dimension has commented this exact thing to me in another dimension before
Trump was cool policy wise, fiscal, war, regulation cutting.

It’s too bad the dude couldn’t chill and stfu, so now we have the old guard washington creeps who ran the government the past 40+ years coming back in to fuck things up


On the bright side now we will have BLM and LGBTQ+ drones bombing the poor brown people, so I guess you could call it progressive
just send your wife to me
Whut
The screenshot doesn’t make sense to me. Sell 13.48 - buy 11.98 is only 1.5 credit. How could your total return is that much?

Nice one. I’m just going to buy more the second it drops below $24.50 - if it ever does again 💪

Omg NIO mite win an Oscar

Bro, go do another line. You're fading.
I’m confused but 🚀🚀🚀
Not sure anymore if Nio is an EV stock or a film production one
Bad news means stonk goes up
Impact might be a bit more profound. Again this news comes a day after Boeing’s 2.5B$ settlement with the U.S govt. it wouldn’t be out of the question for there to be a huge drop public. And I’m willing to bet the significance of the plane being 30 years old is going to be overlooked
Up until just before 2007 banks were offering 16% savings accounts in the UK 

You can’t even get more than 1.5% now lmao
Wait there was a crash?????
Any one holding loto calls for next week?
I believe it was a 737-800
I've been in since around $17 most of my portfolio is pltr now 🚀🚀🚀
Nio day needs more car honking!!!
[removed]
Maybe it's because I'm thinking about taking the LSATs
So more taxes and regulations that cost even more money to be in compliance with will help up and coming small businesses?

Okay
Been way harder to rig, thats for sure.
See?!!
Well they just laid off 50+ people’s lives in Indonesia. I’d say that will take some precedence.

What in the ever loving fuck does this have to do with cars
I love nio day😂😂😂😂
It's honestly painful to see it time and time again on this sub. Doesn't even matter if you need it or not. Let it compound and have millions later, how is that not a no-brainer when you're lucky enough to be in a position where you can get out of an obvious bubble with immense profits. You made 250k but will just let it go because you don't need it? Why invest in the first place?

I think the nio livestream is switch to Babel 2
You can guarantee BA will drop to 150 if it’s found that faulty plane mechanics was the cause of the crash.
Common op positions brah!
That’s what it has become. It appears to be what happens when you hand the crazy conspiracy theorist wing of your party Presidential power and soapbox.
NIO going for the Grammys, Emmys and Oscars
Sure, but Cathie’s models do not include “Stock Split” & “S&P Inclusion” so technically we are not @ 4.000 $ yet.🚀🚀🚀🚀
Man I cant wait for Neo to come to Netflix
I don't know what is worse, MAX crashing again or more types of aircraft falling from the sky that are made by Boeing ...
NIO day might be the worst shit i've seen for a long time
Georgia was gonna go blue no matter what through cheating.  They did it before and did it again.  No consequences - why not?
Its not a max though. That plane could have been 20 years old.
Exactly. If they can build on the whole clothing-brand and housing in such a massive market like China this company could be huge.
He woulda won easily. Economy was booming
In a pandemic this terrible you would be willing to get within 6 feet of someone else wow. Thats dangerous.

It might take a few weeks but I will get back to you on that one. I feel it's up for debate personally. That just means I need to source some rolls and make some breakfast sandwiches to confirm your theory.

Challenge excepted!
Puts on r/investing
debris found. fk planes
Yeah BA puts it is.

Also, RIP to those who perished. Really awful news. Gonna be a deathblow for BA if they find it was a result of faulty mechanics.
Nio lifestyle is the way
Any chance we can agree that using the term retarded is as uncouth as any number of other judgmental, derogatory terms that refer to the unchosen abilities of other people around us that we love?
Short Boeing.
mango - lol
OK wat was that movie lol, didn't understand it at all
I have a buddy who’s a commercial pilot. When I asked him about the problems he said he wouldn’t worry flying out of the US or Europe. 

These crashes happen in areas where the pilots don’t have the same stringent requirements and training to become a pilot. He said that his experience flying and doing some training across the globe showed him a huge difference in standard. 

They’re also the countries that won’t spend more money on better tech from Boeing (this is Boeing’s biggest problem). Boeing has to re-evaluate their business model in this aspect because it’s killing their brand.
By that logic so is Tesla.

Doing the lords work, thanks.
I mean, even though a lot of is silly, this shows that Nio isn't just a car company. It's a lifestyle-company. They also have a lot of focus on merch, housing, customer service, tech etc. This is what makes them stand out from all the other EV's competing in the market.
Social media sites are not nation-dtates bud. Teiiter was not created when the constitution was created they have the right to do what they want.

Yeah
Really nice job man. You are imo much more imptessive than some dude getting in tesla in jan 2020. The latter is also a matter of luck but you clearly had vision
Woke up early cuz I thought they were gonna announce the nio cyber truck and I’m watching a retarded Chinese Super Bowl halftime show
Nio day looks like a fun event to be at I’m not gonna lie.. chilling with fellow nio car owners (probably also nio stock owner themselves) while watching live performance and being given the best confirmation bias by Chinese Elon William Li

Straight up I would not fly on a Boeing plane rn lol
Retards aren't gonna edumacate themselves.
This is a brilliant long-term play:

Now is very possibly a turning point for the automotive industry, which has a precedent in the semi industry.

In the 1980s the semi industry was dominated by large, vertically integrated companies (think Intel, IBM, ...)

The high (and ever increasing) capital needed for building factories was a problem for startups and stifled innovation. Startups had to enter into deals with OEMs (often competitors) to manufacture their chips. 

1987 : enter TSMC, pioneered the contract manufacturing model. Startups now had a partner which was 1. Dedicated to their customers success (win-win) and 2. Not a competitor in the marketplace

Those startups are the likes of : NVDA, QCOM.

Decades later, where are NVDA, QCOM, TSM ? Tendie town. How about INTC, IBM ? There you go.
Not if you encourage terrorism

NIO concert
Typical Saturday morning - up at 5:30.  Having a cup of covfefe.  Looking through some past trades I made.

12/8 - Bought  (1) 1/15 TSLA 750C for $4665.

12/11 - Sold  (1) 1/15 TSLA 750C for $3253.

Loss = $1412

Would have been worth $13,910 at yesterday's high.

Missed profit = $9245

Hands = 1 ply Toilet Paper
Planes or stock market?
Lifetime. But I would suppose a lifetime pass would be more than $10k

I think I've seen too many Apple events to take this 100 hour pre show NIO is doing, thought this would be over in 1 to 2 hours😂
Twitter has to face an all blue congress and president. I think they sacrificed some short term problems so they don’t face long term repercussions.
Oh fuck its you again lol . You used that same insult on me like a week ago.....and yes we wore masks and there hasn't been a lockdown since march dont know where you live but I just got it around Christmas.  Our daughters daycare teacher got it who gave it to her who was asymptomatic and gave to us.
All these westerners confused by Chinese corporate events lmaooo. In China it’s a huge event, usually with a feast, and a very elaborate show with the format of a variety show. Really high production value, unlike TSLA in a parking lot with a power point presentation.
And then, you keep doing this because your fuckin addicted, and again and again and again
In the famous words of the GREAT Billy Burrrrrrrish reading a ad(with trumpish liberties). "INDOCHINAA", for a great feel and fit, on the flight ya want, look no furrrrrtheerrr then a "INDOCHINAA" FLIGHT to "Hopefully get you were you going even if it's HEAVEN!"

GREAT LIBERTIES WERE TAKEN, and I love me some Billy Blue balls ad reads which lead to this.
Bro what the fuck is this NIO Band 😂😂
Another paragraph with nothing useful in it. It's a liberals wet dream. Worst case scenario is me reading more of your incessant whining. No land, no vote. Simple as.

If there was a pass for $10k that allowed me to see any escort I want, but they had to be low tier women(listcrawler), I would buy that in the blink of an eye.
Mind telling me what was the first stock you purchased?  Curious
Boeing is no longer a blue chip stock nor value investment. There’s a lot that they fucked up and a lot that’s outside of their control. It’s going to take them years to recover.

 not playing nio but if i was a gambler monday is a sell the news event
Exactly, I think its possible that they might release some news in anticipation of an event like CES just to give them more attention / more to talk about, but they were never going to make an annoucement like that on stage.
So NIO day is a concert or what?
Was expecting cars, but apparently they pivoted to being a record label after Tesla reaching Saturn🚘🤷🏻‍♂️
Pleas don’t crash again
Me too. Me too. Me too.
haha yeah dude totally agree, anyways can i suck ur pussy bro?
Extremists on both ends of the spectrum give their respective sides a bad image. I used to be left leaning until I started noticing all the hypocrisy and virtue signaling go rampant. Not to mention the blatant lies while watching them report on news and intentionally edit videos to spin the narrative. 

To me the thing that will cement my opinion on the left as being bad is how they deal with the China - Taiwan issue. Under Trump, the US sold Taiwan missiles which pissed off China. If they don't do the same under Biden then fuck him.
wtf is up with the double negative.
I shorted tesla on Friday for the first time in my life.... Let's see how this post ages... Last 3 days was just a vertical climb.  It makes no effing sense....
BA will have some dead cats along the way, sure, but its definitely going to zero now. In a last ditch effort, they will merge with Moviepass, and might catch a pre-delisting pump

You are accurate but your timing sucks.
Bro, gme will always go up after those swings. Key is to hold ass tight and just buy on dips. If you do sell-buy-sell-buy swings You are getting better price  but also help shorters along the way. It does not matter that much if your cost basis is 16, 18 or 20 if GME gonna be 5x

Why did TSLA drop in after hours for no reason?

So, I hope you can see how an attempt at thwarting the transition of presidential power, something that’s truly unprecedented in this country’s history, might outweigh the events of last summer. Not to say that last summer’s events weren’t also crazy, but that was once-in-a-decade level crazy, rather than a once-in-this-country’s-history level of crazy.

Edit- It's $2.6 mill after 40 years if you dont account for inflation (assuming 8.5% compound interest every year)
Right but like I said, could be informative for what it is to see who plays what at certain times even though it’s constant changing. So yea, that knowledge is prob worthless lol. A good thought though, thanks everyone for the help. Cheers
I did a Masters paper on Tesla vs GM Strategy in April 2019 and bought stocks right after only to sel them for 50% gain... It would have been 1300% today.

Urban roaches never have good comebacks, or any original ideas, or anything useful to say for that matter. I've laid my argument out.

For what its worth I think Trump honestly did think America's never ending wars and meddling in foreign countries was truly a waste of american lives and money, but as far as I can see as soon as he took office the slimy fucks who keep this system running convinced him NOT to put a stop to it. Sadly maybe if Trump wasn't a pretty big narcissist he would've gone through with really disengaging the american war machine, but he obviously caved in without much effort.  


And I'm saying this as a pretty far left person, if that counts for anything. I seriously do think that the neoliberal democrats are scum that simply put on a nicer veneer and focus on giving us cabinet members who have ethnic backgrounds as virtue signaling so that they can continue fucking over the working class and maintaining the never ending military spending and campaign donor favors.

I remember watching the Senate deliberations and it was fucking beautiful watching almost an hour or so of Republican senators sobering up to the situation, many of them dropping their objections, and giving some actually moving speeches about putting country over party.  
  
Then I switch it over the House deliberations and it cuts straight to Gaetz screaming at Democrats about how it was probably just a false flag antifa operation and defending Trump.  
  
Pretty much wanted to facepalm myself at that point.

Some blog is not proof of anything. You are correct it got rejected based on standing. Saying that Texas can't have an issue with penn breaking its own election laws. That is debatable. The only place to redress issues between states in the Supreme Court. It absolutely wasn't a publicity stunt. Texas has a reason to not want to be disenfranchised by other states breaking election law. The case was not rejected on merit as i said. So courts never heard anything to do with that specific case of the penn Supreme Court acting unconstitutional. It was a pussy move by the Supreme court.

I want capitalism to be a tool of society rather than a master. But I'm not able to change that today, so I'm trying to have fuck you money and not be a wage slave.

And in the mean time I'll keep voting for and giving money to progressive causes to try to slow the cancer of capitalism.

It took 125 years for the population to double between 1 and 2 billion (1803-1928)

47 years for 2 to 4 billion (1928-1975)

we're not at 7,6 billion and projected to hit 8 at latest 2023 (48 years) Source:Ourworldimdata


The population increase will stagnate yes, but when it has, we will be beyond fucked already (projected to hit closer to 12 billion once the African baby boom is over)

Had we stayed at 4 billion like in 1975, humanity would be in a MUCH better position to combat global warming since we would have 50+ years of technological advancements before they would hit our current levels.

Right  now, we are super fucked, all we can do is mitigate the problem and personally make sure you won't be as affected. Shit's gonna br bad when hundreds of millions of people will be forced from their homes

> idk how tf you got “slim” margins... especially with the presidential race

Wisconsin (20k/3.2m) 0.6%  
Arizona (11k/3.2m) 0.4%  
Georgia (12k/4.8m) 0.3%  

Less than 50k votes across 3 states was the difference between Biden winning and Trump winning. That would have been a 269/269 tie with Republicans in power deciding the winner.  

Or a win if the Nebraska/Maine single-electoral vote districts had been marginally different too. I haven't looked at the margins to see how close those were, I think there was one of those that flipped unexpectedly this year too.
i give you the permission to fuck my sister u/killyourvibe
Pretty sure I got downvoted the moment I said  BLM rioters =  bad. It’s funny though, because there’s so much negative consequences from the  BLM protests.

1) physical damage to society
2) spread of covid
3) propelling victim mentality in black folks who never felt that racism held them down in life, and changed the way other people look at black folks for the near future
4) separation of status between blacks and others

I’ll leave it at that, but yeah, it’s the BLM portion which got me downvoted for sure

I think champion is more the equivalent of underarmour's start, being a cheap alternative to name brands like Nike and addidas.

381.... with TSLA on it's insane run? I'd say likely.
I'm saying your scenario to this guys hypothetical situation is the same as what we actually have right now. Its not someone voting to take your house but its thousands of losers voting to take your money for free shit.
Nah. I do a lot of DD but I don't trust myself with this crazy volatile period. Like the recent job loss numbers should have made the market red but it just keeps chugging along. I have made short term plays which blew up thanks to Trump's tweets, although I guess now we don't have to worry about that lol.

I think a really interesting play right now in the EV scene that hasn't made a lot of noise yet is Geely. Baidu and Geely just announced they are going to work together to make EVs. You got Baidu which is pretty much Chinese Google and Geely which now owns a majority share in Volvo working together. The plus side is they are both powerhouses and have a lot of weight behind them. The downside though is the EV market is already heavily saturated with other companies and Tesla is pushing hard into China. Im waiting to see how the Biden/China relationship plays out for a bit before I put more into Chinese EV but there could be some good movement. Best of luck!
TSLA to $1200 this year?

Heres the scenario:  Amazon announces 1:30 split, it gets super hyped up and people take out their Tesla money to pump Amazon. The house of cards that is Tesla crashes and the entire tech sector loses momentum and everything just starts spiraling down.
You're a Tesla bull, you say?

God damn just saying "no land, no vote" triggers soyboys so hard it's unbelievable. Then I would go buy another house with a bunch of land.

Have anyone of you actually been to a gamestop in the past few years? Most of the stores around me has either closed or downsized. The ones left pretty much only sell gaming merch and the stores are almost always empty whenever I've gone past them.

I don't live in the US so my experience may of course be different to others, but GME has been slowly suffocated for a long time over here. I have some a lot younger cousins in early teens and they have probably never been to a gamestop and neither have their friends, everything is online or megastores for them. Gamestop needs to attract the younger crowd or they will just keep stagnating
This is the way.

Ok you’re right I won’t. I’ll get up, get off Reddit and go for a run. Lots to do no use in moping!!!

If the stock keeps its momentum and analysts update their price targets I think it could make it till the 60s-70s next week. There's a chance it would go sideways. We'll see; I'll decide on Monday.

What legal protections? I assume you’re talking about 230. Do you even know what that states?

Section 230 generally provides immunity for website publishers from third-party content. At its core, Section 230(c)(1) provides immunity from liability for providers and users of an "interactive computer service" who publish information provided by third-party users.

The statute in Section 230(c)(2) further provides "Good Samaritan" protection from civil liability for operators of interactive computer services in the removal or moderation of third-party material they deem obscene or offensive, even of constitutionally protected speech, as long as it is done in good faith.

I doubt you can comprehend this but there’s multiple parts of 230 that people conveniently forget... like the next fucking paragraph in the legislation.

they also tweeted statistics showing how the Uyghur population had been increasing...but the graph only went as far as 2018.

Even a new tax rate would likely take 1-2 years to roll out if it's pass tomorrow. I also doubt the more moderate dem would back an extreme tax raise anyway without a lot of back and forth with will give us plenty of time to take action.
I have health insurance through my job as almost every middle class American does. So no thanks.
More seriously, because inflation and interest rates are practically zero, people value what could be big in the future over what is big right now because there's not much depreciation of the currency

If interest rates start rising people will dump Tesla stocks and Musky boi will drop right back down

I am a firm believer that you should not be able to vote unless you own land. Real acreage too, not some bullshit 1/4 acre townhouse nonsense. "B-b-but I pay taxes!!" Squeaks the undereducated urban roach. You pay a protection fee to live here, you don't pay taxes unless you pay property tax, sales tax and employment tax don't count. No land, no vote. Simple as. It would ensure our elections are backed by integrity and not by a bunch of city losers piled on top of eachother. Dumbasses.

Hi bored I am Snoo
A real conclusion - the bubble burst will start once there is a huge driver for that. Small ones will be ignored since it’s too much cash and available cheap money in the economy and everything will be growing until it’s there.
So far THE ONLY driver I can see is interest rates increase. And it will happen in a year MINIMUM, depending on when inflation rises too much. Federal reserve already mentioned that they plan to keep the rate near zero for couple years.
So the plan to be in cash  by the year end and wait for flash sales 😎
Until then let’s ride the fucking bubble and make some tendies

Unfamiliar terrain fighting against locals who know the land inside out using guerilla tactics isn't exactly comparable to fighting in the US where both sides would know the territory well. Plus you are immediately assuming "the people who have been pushing to defund them for the past 4 years " are in charge in a hypothetical tyrannical governement, it may, it may not be. Also, it's hard to rebel against the system if you don't know if your fellow comrades would rat you out. If members of the military don't believe in the tyrannical government, but they also don't know if they are the only ones who think this way, then they won't take any action.  Just look at how hard it is for whistleblowers to expose government wrongdoing even through legal channels built by the government. The government and by extension the military is sort of built-in away with little reliance on individuals and several redundancies. In a case where military personnel may dis-agree with a hypothetical tyrannical government, their impact would probably be minimal.

what about it?
I would start super small with my buy ins, if it bounces back, well hey I made something, if it keeps dropping I can double my holding a few times averaging down each until I'm where I wanted to be.

As long as what you're buying is actually profitable/viable, which half of these spacs etc are not.

Going to the gun shop and buying a suppressor. Haven't taken gains and done something with them in a while, and after this week now is the time to treat myself.

In addition to being a lifestyle brand, NIO is also planning to make money from:  

(1) Leasing its powertrain/EV technology to other car manufacturers.  

NIO owns XPT which makes the powertrain:  https://www.xptglobal.com/cn/

GAC Auto partnered with NIO to form GAC-NIO to make affordable EV.  They recently received $370M cash infusion:  https://cnevpost.com/2021/01/06/can-gac-nio-change-its-fate-after-receiving-370-million-capital-increase/

(2) NIO is the leader in battery swap technology.  It has indicated it is willing to let other cars use its battery swapping station for a fee.  

(3) Partnership with Mobileye to build robotaxis.  Report indicates Mobileye is testing their robotaxis concept with NIO cars in Israel. 

(4) NIO is creating its own self driving chip and is working toward autonomous driving:  https://www.google.com/amp/s/cntechpost.com/2020/08/14/nio-doubles-down-on-autopilot-with-important-new-hire/amp/

I feel you, bro. Not only the Biden presidency but the global economic lockdown is A+ hyper-stagflation material. Market can stay irrational for longer than we can stay solvent. Doesn‘t matter. I‘m bullish on gold and I take my positions accordingly.

I didn't pay much attention to QS because it jumped before I learned about it. Did they jump the shark by going public too early via SPAC like RIDE did? Were they approached by the SPAC to go public or were they already looking before they were approached? Some of these companies weren't really in the position to be launched like that but they did because of the cash grab mania.

I was there. Everyone knew virus should make the market go down, but leading into what were the first days of the big drop the market was going up insane day after day. Attempting to be short was a sure way to 0.

It wasn’t until Italy shutdown that the markets finally reacted.

As I said, you're delusional if you think there was even a remote possibility of losing one of those people, much less *"all three"*.

Why didn't you buy?

We make decisions based on the information we have now. 

My real life example :
I sold my tsla calls at $600 PRE SPLIT. Would have been 100k each now... That kinda thinking is useless. 
While in fact I made that decision back then with the knowledge i had then: I couldn't tolerate losing this amount of money (I shouldn't even bet with that money i can't afford to lose)

Tldr:    
Write down why you make decisions NOW, REGRETS are useless. Look FORWARD.

How many shares did you buy at what price? "More than 2"... This guy's a 🤡 who won't even post his actual position because it never existed. The math doesnt check out, whether you account for the 5:1 split or not. It's literally impossible to have made this gain % on TSLA shares.

Pretty much. Someone older whom I know lost money in a bunch of Venezuelan companies before they all got nationalized. He described shares being gradually dumped until they becamepenny stocks and finally got delisted. Think HTZ but no OTC afterlife

Unpopular opinion: The CURRENT market thrives more on trends/fomo over fundamentals/valuations.

By this theory, no one is smarter than the other when it comes placing your bets (options). Trust your gut, have fun at the casino, and good luck.

One thing most of us non-millionaries dont think about is how easy it is to become focused on the wrong goals. Its common for people who make huge gains to start focusing solely on numbers on a screen, instead of the happiness and prosperity those numbers are supposed to bring. This is specially true for people who had to live very modestly in order to start investing, as they developed an irrational fear of ever enjoying their money. 

Money is just a tool, not an end.
They never said that. Show me the case where they said that? None of this shit was ever heard in court.

Set an upper limit goal.  If you reach it, you cash out, pay your taxes, buy your boat/cabin in the woods/large city apartment overlooking the central park/compound in Martha's Vineyard/etc and fucking retire.

My guess is that you'll never reach it following any of the information/advice found here and, hence, your "The Meaninglessness of It All".
Def moved more into EV due with their surge. However, the riskier I get with my plays the more cash I have to back up in case if I need to  average a position down.

Also a icr conference wouldn't drive the price down.... and wouldn't u be excited if u knew something was coming that others weren't sure about. 

He also gave the shorts a warning something was coming with the ben frank implying hes gonna be one of the founders of the new gme.

Not really. There wasn't any choice. Even Lindsey graham back pedaled, and it's only because at some point they're gonna be banned from holding federal office.

I mean if you've spent any time online in the last 4+ years you know there are many thousands of absolutely stupid and insane people formed into different bubbles and cliques on different political and ideological topics.  That some of them actually arranged to show up to the capitol together is completely unsurprising to me, and I'm not sure why it surprises anyone else.

I think social media is hugely detrimental to public health and this sort of thing will continue to happen as people who are crazy can easily find and socialize with other people who are equally crazy online.  Eventually we'll have to find a way to fix that, because it's basically a mental health crisis. Obviously that can't be solved with voting transparency.
The military can and will refuse that sort of tomfuckery. Refusing an unlawful order is protected.

You’re trying too hard to justify valuations. You realize the entire market is the same overextended territory right? 

NIO is expecting to 3-4x their production this year then another 2x from that point next year. So there’s your 6-8x in 2 years, not that it matters imo bc I think your numbers are BS. I think you’re still not seeing the bigger picture here, I’d also recommend watching some interviews of the CEO to get a sense for his vision. You have to analyze more than current car deliveries.

Feel free to short tho
Bruh renewables were 14.7% of USA's energy market. 70% of USA's energy came from fossil fuels, which aren't going anywhere anytime in the next 2 decades. TSLA is so insignificant right now to major utilities its a joke, and will only really start challenging major oil and gas companies in the 2030s - 2040s. Is it good to hold till 2050? Sure, just like how MSFT was great to hold in the 70s and 80s. Will TSLA retards hold on till 2050? No fucking way, the bubble will burst and people will scramble for the doors to cash in, it'll be a frenzy

Why does everyone say options are dangerous? I must be missing something, right?


Also OP buys needs 80k to buy the shares, right? Or can he also make profit when selling this contract to someone else?
My dick
Some people kept counting over night 🤡🤡

and the ones counted at night being mail in ballots were mostly Biden votes cause they actually care about the pandemic so it wasn’t Biden votes were coming in fast as much as it is trump votes weren’t coming in over the mail

Yes bro and it’s genuinely normal and expected when you 

1) don’t have enough staff/can’t because of the PANDEMI
2) have an unprecedented # of mail in ballots

I was dropping some borrowed muffin pans at a friend's house and as I was approaching their neighborhood I reached down into the passenger's floorboard to grab them and place them in the passenger seat.  That way, I could just grab them, hop out, give the pans to them and be on my way (I was in a bit of a hurry).  

By the time I got them to the seat, I had looked up and was drifting into the oncoming lane.  I was able to pull myself back in time to avoid the oncoming traffic.  Honestly, I barely crossed the center line, but it was definitely noticeable.   

Well, the first car in the oncoming traffic was a police cruiser.  He immediately turned around, and pulled me over.  He obviously inquired about my noticeable drifting and I had no reason to lie to him.  I told him "I was situating my muffin pans."  Noticing his confused look, I gestured to my passenger seat as two pans rested upon it.  He admitted to me that was the first time anyone had ever used that excuse on him.  

I obviously elaborated, and he let me go with a chuckle, reminding me that "situating muffin pans" should wait until I reach my destination.  I'm certain he went back to his precinct and added that excuse to the "Ridiculous Excuse List" I'm certain every precinct has.

People were literally chanting to hang Mike Pence and the situation could have very easily deteriorated to the point of putting the lives of elected legislators in danger. All of this during the certification process of the electoral votes. I don’t see how it can be viewed as anything less than an attempt to thwart the transition of power. And while I understand there’s a lot of questions regarding the legitimacy of votes, after all the lawsuits, the hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of rewards offered for tips, the recounts in particularly tight counties and states, the ultimate rejection by the supreme court . . . There is literally no amount of evidence or transparency that can be offered at this point that’ll persuade people who’d rather take Trump’s word as the infallible truth in these matters.

I can’t justify the valuation now. However, in 5-10 years time it will be more.

Because they weren’t successful doesn’t mean they didn’t try and do so at the incitement of the president’s words. Hysterical, and delusional is the sitting president not sending in the national guard and then telling the people who broke into the Capitol that he loved them and that they were very special.

I’m not pushing anything, that’s what he did. He needs to be impeached for that alone.
Its totally normal for 5 swing states to all pause counting at the same time on election night, tell everyone to go home and then 3 hours later have a larger ballot count than any other all in the losing candidates favor right?

Lol have you seen the chicanery that is RH? Granted, we have stop losses now. But watch people buy back in at the slightest pause in the dip after dropping 20%, only to watch it drop another 20%... then stall for weeks, buy in again, and watch it drop another 20%. At that point, they’ll wait. It’ll go up a bit, then down a bit, then back up again. People will think that’s surely the end, so they buy back in... and it might be. But when in this time, as other automakers start stealing market share in EV, it’s more likely to trade sideways for years. As others have said, I’m not trying to time the bubble popping. These retards are more committed than I am.

So the year Tesla's stock price crashes, does he get his wealth taxes back?

That covers his double-down by continuing to tweet from the Presidential twitter account after his personal account got banned.

[https://www.cnet.com/news/trump-tweets-video-after-twitter-locked-his-account-in-wake-of-capitol-riot/](https://www.cnet.com/news/trump-tweets-video-after-twitter-locked-his-account-in-wake-of-capitol-riot/)

I believe it's the last bit of info in the second article.  President Trump said he was not going to attend the inauguration of President-Elect Biden.  Which, (my assessment), could have been interpreted as a signal to allow something bad to happen during the inauguration. I know, it's a stretch... but I can't make sense of the last 4 years as it is.

I can extrapolate so much about your personality from this post and "warblade" as the username
fat bitch
You think Trump was owned by Russia? Are you an idiot. All of his geopolitical policies were against Russian interests. Being hard on Iran, supplying oil to europe, increasing funding to nato. Shit Russians love lefty policies. They laugh while all of Europe builds windmills and has to buy gas from Russia. Or when we gave billions to Iran to buy Russian weapons with.
I love how your portfolio is just a tesla graph
I think the Capitol thing is pretty overblown. 

You've got Europe sitting over there on their high horse when they regularly have massive riots and protests and we have one instance of a couple thousand people pushing into a public building while the police basically stand back and watch, and suddenly we're no longer a "moral authority" and we've somehow ruined our free elections? lol

It's one of those situations where the other countries using it as ammo were just waiting for an excuse, the situation itself is nothing compared to actual issues of election integrity. We're a first-world nation that suddenly can't manage to agree on whether our process has been fair - that's the major issue and that transparency needs to be addressed so that this strife doesn't happen for the same reason in the future. The physical strife is just a symptom.

You shouldn't need a judge to decide if an election was fair, everything should be physically recorded and recountable, and there should be video of the entire process top to bottom. Inexcusable that we don't monitor in a close and transparent way in this digital era.

Salty? It's called "Law and Order". Probably the TV show.

The President made a point about it like every five minutes when he took his Twitter mouthshits. 

But he wouldn't know a fucking thing about the Constitution. Can't even be bothered to try to read it. Just qqs and bitches all day. He's like a gay bear or smth.

Now doofuses and incels everywhere are all like" deepfake", "antifa", and presidential pouts since it turns out that angry, mostly poor, 20-somethings haven't learned to critical think in the years since Zeitgeist and Blair Witch were revealed as NOT documentaries and their lives truly are pretty meaningless.

It was rejected on laches. You can’t complain about the rules after the match especially not after you made the rules and didn’t object to them earlier when you won or within the 100 days timeframe.

They have to blame him for every ounce of bad in the country right to the end.  Because in 11 days with a blue president and congress, they’re only gonna have themselves to blame for the next 4 years.
There was an attempted deep state coup that took place quite recently. The CIA falsified evidence of Trump's Russian collusion. It was completely disproven. We don't know of course that this happened, but this kind of fraud in government is certainly within the realm of possibility.

I can see both sides of the argument on this one. I mean the degree to which Trump egged the crowd to march on the capital was pretty outrageous and I think it could send a good message to the rest of the world that that sorta shit isn’t tolerated, especially since we’ve lost a lot of the moral authority in criticizing other countries on their own elections processes. I’m also worried it could just lead to more anger and rioting too though. Such a shitty position to be in tbh.

As someone who was wealthy once before I fell in love.  
I wouldn't mind.  
People with several billion dollars shouldn't mind several million a year either to improve the condition of humanity (at least to genetically augment them to not be so damn ugly and autistic).

Musk is already looking for enlightenment since he has so much damn money and my girl, Grimes. Never gonna forgive her for that. She should have me for a baby!

Fuck you, Papa-Daddy Elon!
This to me is the biggest question mark against Tesla. The Europeans are starting to make some pretty successful electric cars and already eating into Tesla's market share. The Chinese are pouring tens of billions of dollars into jumpstarting their own industry, and word through the grapevine is their cars aren't trash anymore. The other American carmakers are... well they might get their act together. The Mach-E seems to be getting pretty good reviews. This might be a chance for another American EV startup to take the place of one of the big 3.

So going forward I think Tesla's moat is shrinking. Their biggest strengths are they have the best technology (for now), and since they have a lot of capital and sex appeal they can throw money around and hire the best people.

Well yeah, TSLA is kind of a unique case because of the continuous short & gamma squeeze that's probably happening, but I wouldn't say that the whole argument goes away just because TSLA stands out from other stocks.

Don't you think it's possible that it's happening because of the constant market stimulus? I mean, even in 2021, it seems that the central banks are going to be pumping more than $240 bn (iirc) worth of QE each month ($120 bn from the US).
What the hell are you on about? First off it’s 50-50 split in the senate unless we recently gained 10 states I don’t know about, the Supreme Court is fine as we’ve seen with the bitch slappings they’ve given trump,

Yes the lost a good chunk of seats in the house but that’s because the gained an insane amount in 2018, house seats returning red wasn’t that much of a surprise 


And finally I don’t know what shitty ass plays you made but I almost quadrupled the amount of money in My account with calls and stocks this week

you can see what happened to apple when jobs died. huge drop but recovers. of course these ceo's have a long term plan all laid out.

the permanent drop would be if earnings comes around and they're consistently failing to deliver, which wasn't the case for apple at least.

>Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California threatened on Friday that the House could move to impeach President Trump over his role in inciting a violent mob attack on the Capitol if he did not resign “immediately,” appealing to Republicans to join the push to force him from office.

>After a 3.5-hour call with fellow Democrats, Ms. Pelosi said she had instructed the Rules Committee to be prepared to move forward with either a motion for impeachment or legislation sponsored by Representative Jamie Raskin, Democrat of Maryland, to establish a body under the 25th Amendment that can declare a president is “unable to discharge the powers and duties of his office.”

>“It is the hope of members that the president will immediately resign,” Ms. Pelosi said in a statement. “But if he does not, I have instructed the Rules Committee to be prepared.”  

Damn, how salty do you have to be to try for an expedited impeachment of a guy that's due to leave in two weeks, and who you already failed to impeach and remove once on flimsy reasons.  Trying to get "Trump is the biggest Loser" on the books out of spite seems like the worst political move they could make immediately after winning multiple elections by incredibly slim margins.

Not to mention the potential strife that could set off across the country. Trump already said after the Capitol riot that it will be a peaceful transition, but I can't imagine it will calm tensions if they remove an elected president at the end of his term just to make a political statement.

Sounds like fake news to me dude. I highly doubt the GOP and Dems are in on it together, and plenty of senior level gop members have expressed that they know the election wasn’t rigged. What’s funny is that your retarded ass actually believes that conspiracy’s. Not even Trump and his family believe this shit. They just are too stupid and proud to admit defeat.

Literally EVERYONE predicted beforehand that the republicans would win... everyone talked down decriminalization passing the house because of that. But the left spent more than any senate race in history to encourage voters, esp POC, to go out and vote. Only once the race started did it become clear that the left had a chance. Then some gains from the surprise that they won. definitely hasn’t been priced in for all the future legislation, because some of it will be completely new legislation that wasn’t possible to consider before without a blue senate.

I love how the alt right comes up with these narratives. Like literally, they tell stories to make their theories seem plausible.

The obvious problem with that is that the whole point of stories is to follow one thread of thought. That's great for conversation, but it's terrible for analysis. Like in this example, mr. gullible over here makes the correct observation that some people on the left treated Trump as literally Hitler and that to those people, any means would be justified to remove him. Including falsifying an election. Great conversation. But terrible analysis on the current situation. Not just because you can't just run a ballot 5 times (mr. gullible needs to polish up on his knowledge of the process), but also because it doesn't match meta information (all court challenges thrown out) and because it doesn't match common sense (there really aren't that many people who would be prepared to commit election fraud, certainly not enough for a massive conspiracy, which they couldn't hide anyway).

But see, the analysis takes time and isn't fun to share around. The story gets repeated by gullibles all over the world and nobody feels responsible for the damage it causes.
Lol wut.

Dude. When Don Jr came to southern Ohio, our roads and highways were inundated with Trump caravans.  I was concerned that I was gonna witness a car accident. All manner of cars, trucks, and 18-wheelers.

There was one truck on the highway with 6 flags flying out the back. I don't know how they managed it, but those flags were straining to fly off.  I did a couple of passes up and down the highway just to check for American flags so I could give them proper recovery and retirement.

The one car that blew my mind was an SUV with 2 suburban women and a confederate flag strapped to the side that read "My rights don't end where your feelings begin".  I was so stupefied, I forgot to take a picture.

Storing energy that is produced by oil and gas companies is not the same as actually producing the energy.

Oil and gas literally run the world and will for decades. Running our cars and powering our homes are only a fraction of the energy we consume.

Look up how much shit is produced from crude oil and natural gas. Gasoline, electricity, plastics, jet fuel, fertilizers, asphalt for roads and roofs, petroleum jelly, etc.

If you think Tesla with their solar walls are in the same universe as Exxon, papa Elon has convinced you well.

Schmidt should be able to address such a concern without even thinking, as he was the CEO. And Thiel wasnt hostile, he just didnt want to get sidetracked with niceties. And he was talking to a grown man and not a 5 year old.

Interesting. I offloaded my calls today because of all the hype. WSB hype gets to a level that makes me sell instead of buy honestly. Thinking of doing a far out spread Monday. $780p 1000c. One will hit likely.
I'm going to explain to you why I'm tilted by your reply so please follow along. People have a tendency—and you may have noticed this in American culture especially—to give claims in vague, subjective, absolutes. What I mean by vague is that there aren't enough definitions in the claim that are precise enough to be debated. What I mean by absolutes are statements that are regarded as universally valid. You may recognize how pervasive this rhetoric is in places like advertisements, social media, or on the presidential podium. When you fail to properly form a claim and your peers also fail to properly form that claim,  you run into a situation where business magazines and reddit gurus spend  decades regurgitating the same survey analysis as "common sense" without having an actual conversation. You see rallies filled with people nodding their heads and chanting at nothing of substance.          
What does the guy I replied to mean by rich? Is it the same model used in millionaires next door? Is he grouping together people above a tax bracket?  Does he consider there to be multiple tiers of rich, and what would those be? In which tiers do people drive "modest" cars? Modest to who? Is the definition of "modest" isolated from the salary of the owner, or maybe the average salary of the city? Are assets included? Are we weighing the data across time, and comparing it to previous definitions of "rich"? Are we weighing against some cultural perspective of rich? When he says "plenty" is he talking about a fixed number? A ratio? More than previously before? More than a redditor would expect? More than an adult in nebraska would expect?                                                                                                          
He obviously doesn't have to answer all of these questions, I just wanted to know what he is actually claiming otherwise his comment is white noise.
Comments here are fucking long. I’m so used of like “Tesla 1000c 🚀🚀”

the next 2 years there will be a very progressive agenda. Majority of people were under the impression that republicans would win georgia senate. Them winning is a huge surprise and its definitely not priced into the market yet. Everytime theres new news about the left’s legislation, watch what its about, and assume it’ll pass. Play accordingly. 

Personally i’m playing w/ cannabis + green energy. Green energy has already grown a lot in 2020, and will continue to do so under a blue senate.
BLUE SENATE = CANNABIS DECRIMINALIZATION THROUGH THE “MORE ACT” (interstate commerce and international export/import) + BANKING LEGISLATION THROUGH THE “SAFE BANKING ACT”
You guys are great :) Personally I stick to 15-20% ATM 3-6 Month out calls, if it dips you have time to recover. Just hold.

Basically what’s holding TSLA up right now are bag holders. 

Nearly 18% of long positions worth over 10 billion have been offloading since Wednesday. 

When the poors run out of money to fomo the trend will cease and they will begin selling as well. 

Some people are going to be holding $900 bags for the next half year with zero profit while the rest of us reposition for a new entry.
I think the trick is to focus on 2 or 3 stocks not 10 or 15 like i used to do

I don't get the "need" for a drop.

I think land value in Hawaii has increased too much. It needs to drop....so I can buy land. Then it needs to increase, but only after I buy.

If people want to pay a price for a stock, let them.
you'd want the 4000c jan 2021 calls to be a little further out to capture more premium though.

But imagine how much 500 dollars of 4000c march 2021 calls on tsla would get you if you bought them back in march 2019....

HHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHNnnnnnnnnnnngggggggggggggggggggg (it be like 1.5 million).

I know people keep saying correction is coming but we, in reality just had 3 astronomical corrections in the last 9 months. We had March actual CRASH, then September and then October.

It’s working against him this time. He is comparing Enron to Tesla now. He is in full panic mode now. Burry isn’t right every single time, no one can be. Elon is landing rockets on pads in the ocean, sending people to the space station. No way I’m shorting Elon

Maybe gets one last pump to 100 or something on a partnership or investment deal but I think in general the market just kind of realized "wow yeah we have EV and green energy euphoria but this one is just TOO retarded."

But i can see once this starts getting mass inoculation in the groups of people who dont have degrees in healthcare, and won't understand WHY you feel shitty, they'll completely freak out and shit the bed.

Than there'll be some reports about some people passing out from the fevers or some wacky shit, and the conspiracy shit will go full JP-5 fuel, and the market might react, thats the only reason why i half meme saying short PFE. Im still bullish AF on my antibodies lol.

Your average american can't tell you the difference between a virus and bacteria, imagine telling them the side effect is proof that your immune system is responding to the spike protein; ooof.

But the run's not over. Tesla will be 14,000 per share 7 years from now (if J Pow and Yellen keep giving out free money).

Or if you feel "it's already run up too far" (which people have been saying since the summer of last year and year before that), you can always select from any one of the fine meme stonks the generous WSB autists share in the DD section.

PLTR, QS, NIO, XPEV, LI, APHA, LAZR

Currently there aren't any contenders that come close to knocking Tesla off the throne. Tesla is going to be king of the meme stonks for years to come.

The act of caring passionately about there possibly being more than 2 genders is pretty regressive intellectually. I don't see that being a political concept, it's an intellectual one. There's only two feelings: happy and sad. There's only two types of weather: cold and hot. There's only two political ideologies: left and right. Literally nothing in reality can be reduced to a yes/no, beyond the idea of something. Only ideas are that clean.

People who based their identity solely on politics are straight fuckin losers. Both sides are guilty of this but the magatards took it to another level. In Southern California, there were trump car caravans that were 20-30 cars deep that would drive around in trump friendly city with qanon/trump flags, megaphones and honking their horns. When has this ever happened for any sitting president? That tells you what kind of retards make up the magatards. Doesn’t help these retardstook a 4chan joke as gospel aka qanon

I read your post on why you think the ICR conference will ultimately report news that will cause the stock price to go down. Do you think Cohen might be hoping that he does make this play in order to have more leverage going into a majority slate or hostile takeover? Have more evidence that the board isn't doing anything useful?


It is conflicting to me because it seems like his other tweets indicate a play is around the corner, and yet if ICR conference is bearish, then maybe his play is just after ICR conference sometime? Obviously its mostly all speculation, but curious on what you think Cohen's strategic play is

CNN guests whenever the market keeps rising on bad news “the market is forward looking, business travel will be back and life will be normal by April. 20 million vaccinated by end of December.”

Fast forward to January.

Market still rising. “Market is forward looking, sure the vaccine rollout has been slow, but we will have business travel returning to normal, people will want to go out again sometime later this year.
My Sister in law had the same shit happen. Exactly what you described. I think the first one is really to get your body to start making antibodies and the second is a big ass load of the virus mrna mimicking a full on assault on your immune system. She said it was horrible

Bruh, not even sure why you took it if  you already went through it. Your body created the antibodies the first time round. You just made yourself sick
imagine trading and not knowing basic biology.

Go look up what a mRNA vaccine is vs an attenuated vaccine, vs a subunit vaccine.


TLDR: The whole point of the PFE is for the 2nd dose to make your body go code red, and have your immune system haze you; its rough for a lot of people. I did the in the field-FA on it bro; it fucks you up for a day.

Dickwad the extremely leftist DC mayor, who responded to BLM rioters burning her city and a church by painting their name on a street and renaming the city blocks after them, actually sent out a letter to feds ordering them not to send in any reinforcements to the Capitol ahead of the protest without her approval and specifically told police to back down. They wanted this shit to happen don’t think for a second they didn’t.

Your P/E calcs will be at least cut in half in 2-3 weeks when Tesla reports earnings because the trailing 12 month earnings will double and they’ll probably double again by end of 2021. So a 95% drop would give them a 44 P/E, which is way low for a company growing revenues 50% annually for the long term

This was the gayest thing I have ever taken the time to read on wallstreetbets. I honestly deserve to punch myself in the balls for reading the entirety of this post to only learn in the end that you have only 25 shares. 25 shares lead you to write this post. I pray to god that your wife has a hard dick in her right now by her boyfriend screaming anti climatic things referencing this post. You really should go to the closest mirror, look yourself in the eyes, and punch yourself straight in the balls, or the skin that use to hold two round and circular objects.
I would totally support that, BUT, Americans would have to get used to living a life of less consumerism. Cheaply making phones chargers, phones, game console, TVs, etc in other countries has led to insane expectations from Americans about what they should get for a dollar. 70 years ago, you got someone a pair of shoes and they would take care of them. Now and days, people own thirty pairs of shoes snd forget about the unopened boxes of shoes in their closet while buying a new iPhone every year. People shouldn’t be buying new cars every 5 years either. It’s a sad throwaway culture led by cheap goods made in other countries. People complain about globalization, but then they freak out when you tell them to live a simpler life with less consumption. God forbid you tell someone to get a Ford F-250 instead of the extended cab F 350.

Yep. Active Benchmark fund managers. TSLA is now a 2% weight to the S&P and if they don’t own it they’re performance is going to suffer. There’s still a lot more buying that needs to happen also based on public holdings of these funds.
50% efficient storage with $10/kWh costs is already here is my point. The LCOE on thermal is fractional to the new and upcoming savior techs everyone wants. We dealt with fossil fuel efficiency that was lucky to break 40% efficiency until very recently and now we're perfectionists? People are jerking off Elon for breaking $200/ when it can be done for a twentieth of that. Cali solar and Texas wind already throw away free electicity to maintain grid integrity. There is cheap tech already there to reclaim that power and sell it for a profit.

It's not as sexy as the new battery tech but it can be done **today**. Everyone is eyeing the boutique bourbon when the market dominating - terribly bland but acceptably effective - profit machine Bud Light is right in front of their faces.

only thing that could stop tesla would maybe be an increase in interest rates by the Fed which won't be until 2023 - 2024 . TSLA will continue its mission to Andromeda til then.
Owing $800k to a bank on a house you can’t make the interest payments on is going to crush a lot of new buyers.
That'd be a great use of the army of cameras
(Or a bad trade that just got lucky)
all we need is a stock split and the bubble resets!
Genuine question. Why do you like it?
The market is forward looking, except for the stuff it was concerned about happening with a blue wave. It’s near term looking for that. 🤡🤡
Lol unhinged as crazy Nancy would call it
>year

How did you arrive at the 1000 years? Tesla current market cap is 834.17B, their gross profit (ttm) is 4.07B, so that give about 200?
Was it quite?

It’s Twitter and Trump doesn’t own it. Twitter is free to do what it wishes. However, what I’m saying is if Twitter is going to take action such as banning the president, the least they can do is look at the party members on both sides rather than simply aiming for conservative folks.

Once again,Trump is in the wrong here for provoking his supporters to take back their country when he lost the election. However, also is Twitter for being hugely one party sided .

Predictions for next week Twitter stock : slight drop Monday , rebound Tuesday, and life goes on as normal.
They fear us based on catering to us for votes, at a minimum, and that's really where it should end.

Yes I’ve been to every major city in TX and driven between them. This is exactly my point. People fawn over some boring ass land. North Dakota is far more beautiful for example and it’s a pretty boring ass state. You get the same views that tx offers but with better sunsets and national parks and wild areas. It also actually has some rivers running though it. How does central tx compare scenically to a multitude of other places like basically anywhere in CA, northern MI, CO, UT, NM, AZ, parts of NV, etc. ya gotta travel around. 

Hey, at least it’s better in every way than Indiana.
Difference between tampering through false information spread and tampering through changing votes at the ballot box/adding massive amounts of votes for someone. Ones really easy to do, other had a fuckton of checks in place to make sure it don't happen.

Exactly. Tesla will continue to soar for 2 more years according to Burry. Then we switch to puts ! Technically if you think about it, it makes sense because in 2023 is around the time the fed will increase interest rates again which might cause a massive sell-off / profit taking from everyone causing the bubble to "pop" but given its TSLA, I don't expect anything over a 20% drop.

Boy if BUYDEN goes through with partial forgiveness of student loans offered by the government, a shit load of people who spent their stimulus on stonks are gonna spend even harder or even get into it.

Stonks to pluto. 4 years of this shit.

My bullcock is already hard at the idea of fresh meat in the market.
No.
If I were to pick one solution it would be to put the brakes on globalization, maybe put it on reverse. As more and more companies are forced to make products here and no interference from the government in the form of unmanaged immigration, one outcome. Employers will have to pay competitive wages. All the prerequisites will melt away. Things will start to balance out.
Cathy sold TSLA to rebalance her portfolio to keep TSLA under 10% ownership as that is the rule, and TSLA went up a lot so it became more than 10%, so she had to sell. she would be buying if she was allowed. don't need to worry about that. And yeah it is down like 1.5% AH but it went up literally almost 8% today. A little pullback is reallllly not a big deal. so stop the FUD!
Why hasn’t anyone tried to start a “disruptive” health insurance company that uses advanced machine learning shit to offer cheap, poor quality insurance to broke millennials? I feel like investors would eat that shit up.

I love dripping. Lived all around Austin, as far away as wimberley. I think people who have only been to one city in texas just don't understand how huge and varied it is.

Elon, you should have some of the fleet scan for Amber alert license plates when they’re in the suspected area. Use the fleet to catch these people. Sorry if this is already in place. I just got really stoned and had this idea.

TSLA traded $62 billion worth of shares friday, which was more than the 10 next most active stocks combined and double SPY.
Yeah, they are too big and should be broken up.

But until then, cuckservatives need to figure out what they stand for.  Are they for the free market or not?

Why are you so sure about this? It takes a retard to confuse unit cost for total cost. It takes a whole thread of commenting retards to not realize that brokerages automatically adjust unit cost for splits and other activity.
It is possible to sell high karma accounts irl. An easy 16k post karma isn't nothing, especially for something this low effort. And if you put it in tesla calls then that's an easy 10x what you sold the account for.
They had their opportunity but didn't seize the moment because their entire identity since birth is entangled in being part of a set. This is why they are so jaded. Codependent relationships are a bitch. Also, Marge coming along and being much hotter probably wrecked their minds
Who?
Well I care cause buying 3 day Spy calls is all about timing the market lol. Well historically the S&P does better under a democratic president so I’m not sure your point. Ignoring outside political influences isn’t a good way to make money. It has a huge impact.
So Tesla is going to make earnings equivalent to its share price by year 6290? I don't think I can't wait so long. My horizon is 5 -10 years :(
Russian Federal Antimonopoly Service has proposed to introduce export duties on steel products for six months. So it most definitely will happen. MT to the moon, i guess 🌚🌚🌚

Need him to name drop ICLN, for the boys
Not sure if anything can really stop Tesla. If we find out that the FSD beta so far has just been Tesla employees remote controlling people's cars, someone will say that it is genius to outsource car driving and update the price target to $2200.

extremely overpriced too given their revenue numbers and not being profitable. i don’t get the appeal and doesn’t seem to have great brand recognition at all yet.

that being said it is WILD even by the sociopathic markets standards that any and all covid headlines (or basically any headline that isn't stimmy or to a lesser extent china) is just being completely ignored. i remember when we'd have a daily intraday dump in the spring when they released the texas and california covid numbers lol... and now the numbers are like 3x as bad!
You're making the mistake of conflating people voting for Obama, and people voting against trump. Dems could have run a fucking rock for president with a fish for VP and gotten that many votes.
No. Like they pay for 50% of your EV you are purchasing.
Where are you doing your research that you're even running into skanks?
I was able to double my little ass stimulus check so far because of it lol but yeah thats still really good. Its not too late if you still want to get in. I did some napkin math and deductive reasoning since its correlates with shitcorn that it should be valued at $60.00+ per share which it should reach sometime in Feb at the rate its been climbing. 

Also if you have the funds, MSTR. Any strike you can afford for 2/19 and beyond. It's like RIOT but on steroids
Why do you hate money

Sad creature 🥺🥺🥺 do the even exist anymore? Haven’t heard a 🌈 in a while 😩
it's a mid-high range sedan.

most of them are worth less than BMWs and Mercedes and I see those street parked all the time.
I came here to say this. TSLA is *only* up like ~25,000% since IPO in 2010. Whatever shitty system this is divided the *total* gain ($41,454.55) by the *unit* cost ($6.95). That’s just fucking wrong! It needs to obviously divide the *total gain* by the *total cost*... not unit cost. I love when investors don’t even know how well they did, but even after doing *amazing*... they think they did like 25x better! Only in WSB...
The housing market and TSLA are not the same thing. Also, he’s been shorting since like 375. So he’s broke now. This is a post about a homeless person
Hard to be artificial when you're a genuine autist.

Whole next week is all hype still, I even got my dog to invest , everyone is investing into tesla now
this has been my thesis for awhile, by the time this whole thing is over the markets will have ramped for so long on "bad news means more stimmy!" that once they realize that now that "everything is back to normal, no more stimmy needed!" they will dump hard.
I bet they just sell it back to JPow baby
So they took 50 years and came up with this??
ever since that retard zjz mod left it’s been exactly the same LMAO
It's ironic that the folks who don't even like the electoral college are gasping and clutching at their pearls.

> all these companies banning trump NOW because they know he can’t screw them over with a new mandate

welcome to realpolitic
Isn’t it priced in?
The claims of voter fraud had no basis but were allowed to go to judges anyway despite being a waste of time. Because that's part of the system, you can raise stupid cases all you want and they'll be listened to. How much extra time and effort was spent on recounts? How much extra time was spent looking for things that weren't there because people didn't like the results? And then the recounts are the same.

By the way, what is this? Is this domestic terrorism or not? https://nbc-2.com/news/national-world/2021/01/08/police-found-a-pickup-truck-full-of-bombs-and-guns-near-capitol-feds-say/
Impossible.  Any Republican who consents get primaried to hell.
It’s almost time for SPY 180 puts again
Well that was the stock that got me up 9.9k on Wednesday lol. 
But really though who would’ve thought the big tech regulation, blue wave, and workers forming a union was what would push the stock back to near ATH.
picking the poor man’s drug i see

When the pltr lockup is ending
They don’t give a shit about the people now that they have won. There ain’t going to be anymore stimmy checks. But you can bet your sweet ass they will roll out a fat ass stimulus bill that line the pockets of all their favorite companies. So bullish for stocks, bearish for peasants.

someone is still making posts in the wsb weekend discussion thread saying that the short squeeze on GME will come next week for sure.
A bumpy pancake? Sure.
i also recently recovered but not from -97% holy shit...feels so relieving doesn’t it?
Both BLM rioters and the White House vandalists are idiots and should be punished. However, what actually doesn’t seem right is how media is trying to justify BLM actions. I personally feel like the BLM protests were overblown and consisted of extreme virtual signalling which ultimately lead to inadequate changes and unnecessary damages. 

In regards to Trump’s ban, once again, notice all these companies banning trump NOW because they know he can’t screw them over with a new  mandate? Even the big tech are taking action not solely cause of recent events, but also because it’s not going to be affecting their bottom line.

All in all, who’s in the wrong here? Both BLM and Capitol rioters. Should Trump be banned? Yes, but there’s been constant hate messages from higher officials on the left side who should also be muted or banned, however, it’s just the conservatives.
Man I’ve been looking at riot for 2 weeks now and never got in like a pussy bitch.. luckily I had like $1300 in calls the night before plug went 35%, still holding half of dems

I see your point and agree with you to a certain level.

The riots from this week stormed a branch of government while they were executing a constitutionally mandated task. This is on a totally different level that undermines the entirety of the US and its voters.

If we do not condone these actions in the harshest way possible, imagine where this will evolve to in future elections. These are seeds to end democracy globally and must be met with equal force to uphold our democratic insitutions.

This sub gets so weirdly transfixed on one or two meme stocks and the majority of the users are so late to the game on any one stock that they're just giving their money away. PLTR has been sideways since fucking November. Thats like a year ago in 2020 time lol. I made some money off it around the IPO and there's been so many trading opportunities since then that I haven't given a shit about it in months. I went into RIOT, TESLA, NIO in December and my account is rocketing rn. If I had followed the crowd and went all in on  PLTR and GME I'd probably be broke.

TLDR: Do your own research, dont just buy WSB meme stonks
that guy is definitely a retard and autistic. If I were him I would at least take out my C0Ck and let her play with it while I check my RH account.

I do see where you’re coming from, and I do agree that their political agenda is clearly favoring the left, but I think they simply had enough with dealing with such a man child. 

But then again, we don’t really have anything to compare it too, cause no other president has behaved like that on their platform (or anywhere else, really). Sure, this could be the start of the end of freedom to say whatever the fuck you want on the internet, but if the big companies start to censor people based on political views, people will just move to another platform that is not designed for total pussies. Twitter itself has been going downhill for a while. It doesn’t really matter what your political views are, if you say naughty words or criticize something too harshly, you’ll get banned- I’ve been banned like 4 times, and I’m not even that bad. Part of the reasoning behind that is so that they’re advertiser friendly.

At its height you had shamans picking stocks and they would be right because of FOMO. But hey at least some of that ridiculous money went into masterpieces like Akira, Cowboy Bebop and Ghibli

After seeing the roadster and reading Elon’s blog I was sold on EV. No oracle needed, just a bit of vision and conviction to hold.
Ended 2020 with a loss, had to start over with not much then had some swings up and down but were peanuts in December. 

First week of 2021 I deposited my stimulus ($600) and my last $100 (I'm willing  to throw into my tda account) and in 3 days brought my account up to $1550.00. So far off to a great year with current positions looking good.

imo, getting a feel for retail sentiment is a legit way to know if shits gonna go down soon. once everybody expects tsla= free money, it should be time to be cautious, cus any upward movement will be expected by everybody... until it isnt
Just let the two sides fight it out until they see it ain't worth it. Everyone is a hero until they are forced into action. Maybe then at least some common ground can be established.

Im not sure yet. I still have a lot of NIO calls, Riot calls, and NIO shares so Im gonna ride that wave while I look for another opportunity. Honestly might go right back into NIO if I see it rocketing some more. I sold all my Tesla calls friday close to market close though

You think a relief check that is inherently to help the massive percentage of people who are making less due to the pandemic will raise goods and housing prices? The average American still has earned a net negative in the last year compared to average, regardless of being given a couple grand. Beyond that most goods are so competitive you can raise your price because people have more money without being undercut.

I really doubt this massive rally is from retail. Who knows, though. Nothing makes sense anymore.
I guess they better move on hitting their growth targets. I mean they’ve been around for years and still only have 50k customers. idk what kickstarts faster growth. the walmart thing is just another channel to sell plans but walmart has a bunch of other carriers that boomers know already so why would they switch to some random startup if it’s all the same to them.
Stock brokers hate him
There’s still the r/politics lurkers who just downvote what they don’t agree with and don’t engage at all (because they can’t) but overall I think it’s peaceful discourse

she cant have more than 10% of her etf in any one stock. when stock price goes up it takes a bigger percentage of the etf. and once it exceeds 10% she has to sell. She basically is hugging that 10% number so when it goes up she has to sell shares.

I’ve been trying to understand options, I get that you pay a premium to pretty much purchase the share at a lower price in the future if you place a call, but do you guys actually purchase the charges at a lower cost in the future? Or sell that option to other people? How much of this premium would you usually expect to spend, like what would be a good deal? Sorry I just really don’t get it! Thanks!

That’s the million dollar question brother. It’s tough to say really. I think more unions would be the quickest and easiest way to a more stable and healthy local economy. In my state (Missouri), union membership is probably like 8%. It’s only 4.6% in neighboring Oklahoma. But who know. I’m no Rain Man, and these problems seem impossible to solve even for our best and brightest. Oh, and they need to make a cheap breathlizer for weed so employees don’t have to worry about risking a drug test for smoking in their off time. This disqualifies a shit ton of decent hard working Americans from solid employment. I have worked with many dudes in kitchens who had a good head on their shoulders and amazing work ethic, yet they couldn’t escape kitchen work because they smoked pot, often times because they were deep down depressed from a life of shit.

Doesn't matter what tsla has in the pipelines cuz in the end, you need to move your product to people. There's only so much market share you can take. Toyota controls the largest share at 10%! Yet, current valuations of tsla suggest it should control 40. You really think tsla can control 40% market share at current valuations AND continue to grow? Jesus you're delusional. Everybody knows this shit is overvalued. We just riding the wave til it crashes.

No politicians motivated violence against the state with BLM.  With BLM protests, the aggrieved public protested on their own, and yes, some took it too far with looting and violence.  With this situation, Trump both concocted a theft, and then egged on an insurrection.  If there was a leader on the left that was using the same platforms to incite violence like this asshat, then they would be blocked as well.   Don't tell me to check myself, you're a goddamn moron.

Did you see CNN today ? He clarified that his intention was to convey the fact that the rioters were so casually leaving the Capitol that he imagined they’d walk back to their hotels, or have a normal dinner, like nothing happened.

Apparently there’s a mall area around that had a restaurant which is named Olive <something>, but he slipped and said Garden, in the moment.

He said he’s done shows (CNN broadcasts) in Olive Garden where he has constantly praised the food there, and how he has talked about his love for artichoke dips that they serve on CNN before.

It might be posturing, but his explanation seemed to make sense to me, and felt genuine.

I wrote that for the European guy who wanted to understand some of the dynamics behind Right/Left perceptions in America about Big Tech and I needed to mention critiques about FAANG in order to do so.

I'm glad they make so much money; it helps countless Americans to save for retirement and to obtain high-paying jobs. Their stocks that I trade are merely financial instruments; they're just candle sticks on a screen to me. They've also allowed me to make new LT investments in companies with a great mission (Tesla, EV SP.ACs, cry.pto).

I choose other alternatives as a consumer when I don't like the company. (E.g., I use DuckDuckGo for web searches.) I don't hold back from buying a shiny new iPhone though just because they have to score woke points in order to sell their goods to a latte-sipping hipster from Venice Beach.

This seems to be generally true but there must be finite limits when it comes to the spread of disinformation and assault of our democratic institutions. In this case, a sitting President is using their platforms to undermine the very platform of democracy, which provides us these basic freedoms in the first place.

Its not an easy decision and you will never please everyone. In my opinion, it's another place that country must be held above all else when it comes to high ranking political figures.

Montana was shockingly close this year, large in part due to Californians moving there. Another 4 years may allow it to tip. 

Mississippi is a similar situation to Georgia. They have a huge black population that has historically shown poor turnout largely due to the fact that "Mississippi will ways be red" however after the georgia flip, there's a decent amount of organizes hoping to do the same for thier state.
Yes it’s a private company, but the question is should they have the power to censor considering it has grown into a main source of information for public information? 
I don’t quite know the answer it goes back to the idea that the constitution it very good but does the 1st amendment cover social media? 
I am conflicted over this, what would happen if any speak of socialism was banned from social media? 
Personally I think they should be neutral and also not liable for the information on it.
Because it's hard to find the optimal split point.
I don't know your definition of socialism.

But it seems it's been teamed up with healthcare for all, higher taxes on upper end, more equitable access to better education and a better social safety net for the poor and people under temporary hardship.

All these policies are good for the economy overall in time and will have your stock market and quality of life at higher levels.

The whales in here may get taxed some more on their earnings from now on but they'll be able to see less homeless people and look their Wendy's servers in the eyes and know they're living OK.

What? Why are you acting like warrants are free or wouldn't exist if they weren't attached to the stock like a normal spac?

First, you're paying for them, part of the premium over nav is due to the warrants.

Second, because there are only 33% of the amount that there should be demand has severely driven up the prices on them, so you can't buy a full warrant for a reasonable price

Third, this pricing of the full warrants means you have to pay an even higher premium for the fractional warrants attached to the stock, inflating that price too.

It's a terrible design for both novice traders and experienced traders. Novices are forced to pay extra for something they don't understand and may not even actually profit from. Experienced traders can't buy what they want, and what does exist is inflated in price due to the structure.

Of course, like I said before, these jobs will be insanely competitive and hard for dumb trailer trash to get. Back into he 50’s and 60’s, you didn’t have to pass a drug test to work at the post office. Now and days you have to pass a social media background check. Companies expectations are way to fucking high, because their legal departments tell them they have to be to afford the insurance. It’s fucking retarded, and everybody at the top is making gravy on gravy while laughing on their yachts.
Richer folks than you or me. If they’re selling CCs they’re likely hedging by buying more shares 😆
Nio was actually talked about a lot last year on this sub when it was like 2 dollars. I bought calls when it was like 2 dollars and sold once they tripled when NIO hit ~4 dollars. Little did I know it'd be >50$ now...
Which stock should you buy in 2021 to sell with similar gains in 2030?
remember the 2019 days retards were screaming why would u leave 6+ figure portfolio in a RH account

Don't look to ANY corporate news anchor as your basis for how a group or subgroup of people are. These anchors can be real shit heads sometimes. 

By definition, major cable news anchors are part of the elite due to status and often times wealth. There is a desperate need for humility in this country, especially from our leaders and other individuals in prominent political positions.

Aapl calls and fucked don't mix man you good
But state buildings, police departments, mayors buildings are fine? 

Surely any office of the government is equally as bad for ‘protestors’ to storm?
So who are the morons who sell tsla calls?
Yes but space company not tsla. Solar and auto, I'll give you that. Tsla needs 50% market share in autos to justify current valuations. Toyota is 10%. If I give you a conservative 2 toyotas for your auto and battery, that still only puts your market cap at 500b. 800b is way off.
why would they be?
This man is making millionaires by accident everywhere he goes. I bet he’s already run into king Midas biggest problem and is walking around with a solid gold pecker

No lol he doesn't even have any TSLA shares, he just has shitty Russian oil stocks.

And besides, Russia is full of bears, that's why they are so poor.

🇷🇺 🐻
Cathy sold TSLA to rebalance her portfolio to keep TSLA under 10% ownership as that is the rule, and TSLA went up a lot so it became more than 10%, so she had to sell. she would be buying if she was allowed. don't need to worry about that. And yeah it is down like 1.5% AH but it went up literally almost 8% today. A little pullback is reallllly not a big deal. so stop the FUD!

OP is saying republicans are being banned from espousing their viewpoints.  No, private companies are refusing to allow republicans to use their platforms to continue to organize violence.  The unfortunate thing is these individuals are being LIED TO.  They are victims to a cult mentality. It is cognitive dissonance.

Putin is richer but you won’t know
Yeah will do thanks.
Honestly I've been up so much the past few days that I put my initial investment into a safer play, and then bought TSLA 1/15s to hold with my profits. I feel like there's such a hype train behind this that we'll see 900+ next week just because people want to see it happen. The way I see it, I already have my initial + another 50% secured elsewhere, worst that can happen is I lose money that isn't necessarily mine 🤷🏻‍♂️
Can we stop calling it the “mainstream” media or the “liberal” media or the “conservative” media? It’s just the pop culture media. It’s not there to inform you, It only exists to sell advertising. Give less fucks and tune out.
I’ve read this. They say Putin under the books is crazy wealthy
That’s a different machine record you’re referring to. Not the Antrim audit of 22 machines. That was an independent companies publication/findings for Antrim. At this point my faith is big tech, media, and our government in general has been shaken to its core. I don’t believe a damn word they say anymore. I used to think there was such a thing as a good liberal. But I don’t see how there can be morally. I don’t agree at all. Never will it seems.

I got SNAP and sold at $19. I was destined to join this sub.
I bought 100 shares after watching a very positive review of the Mach. It's not a sexy stock and it barely moves, but I've always liked the company and I think they are extremely undervalued. They'll never compete with Tesla, though. You almost never hear anything about Ford or GM. Elon is very good about keeping himself and the company in the news.

Of course they can, but shouldn’t they be neutral? 

By deciding who and what they allow people to freely say they are picking sides just like Cooper and Hannity do

They started off with the idea they would provide everyone a voice to discuss now they’re deciding they only like certain people with certain ideas 

Somewhat undermines their value statement
Make a meme first. Too long
Nice. I got a 860c at $0.28 and sold at $14.45. Like you, I wish I would have bought more. I also sold around $863 and wish I had held off until it reached $880 or so.
Not good. I tried it once, and somehow got this flair. I think I was roofied

It's amazing how delusional these people are. Like yeah, that fat cousin fucking red neck over there is going to lead an army against the strongest military in the world.  The militia shit worked out in the 1700s bc all they had were fucking muskets and canons.
The way you talk just convinced me that this in fact a pump and dump. In the event that you make 100k i still don't owe you an apology. However, I'm sure you're not gonna lose too much money because you're going to sell your position on monday.

Actually I think it's from the ear of anti-bush anti-republican anti-iraq war first Iraq war.  Just because something's loud and aggressive doesn't mean it's Trump or republican.  Too many pussy ass thin skinned progressives make us moderate Dems ashamed to be Democrats.  Real liberals rage against the machine and used to fight for free speech but now everyone embraces PC culture.  We had censorship battles even in the 1980s the late 1980s.  We had to fight for the right to say things and now we have people fighting under the guise of being liberals and progressives trying to silence speech.

He refuses to condemn the extremists in any meaningful way. He says go home but then says you're all special people, the true patriots, the ones saving the country, etc. These same people are the one's that blindly follow Trump and refuse to accept the progress of our election. They're the ones that stormed the nation's capitol. He cannot be allowed to speak publicly in a way that even has *the possibility* of being interpreted as inciting further action from these people. If he wants to continue to incite sedition privately, so be it. He'll pay for it. The stakes are fucking high here, he cannot continue to be given open access to pour more gas on this shitstorm. These people are talking about making senators "pay the ultimate price," and "putting heads on stakes." No person or company can reasonably, rationally, or ethically give the U.S. President leaving office in 12 days a platform to continue, directly or indirectly, allowing these people to feel vindicated let alone feel encouraged to act out treasonously. If he goes on Parler or the dark web, so be it. He can have his twitter back when he openly and unequivocally condemns all those who participated in the insurrection at the Capitol, any anyone who may be planning anything similar.

Scrolling through the Unusual Whales Twitter feed and seeing all the absolute normies that printed money on TSLA calls these last 3 days makes me really scared...
When Anderson Cooper said “...the trump supports have left and gone back to their Garden Inns and eating at Olive Garden” he summed up exactly why the leftist Democrats are so unpopular 

The elitism he showed in that one statement just summed up how both sides are fractured beyond belief.

Imagine thinking the fact you eat at a certain restaraunt or stay at a certain hotel makes you a right wing nut job because Anderson Cooper said so....

Lol I just watched The Big Short last night, so yes, good quote!
Yes and no. TSLA has been red AH, and then back to green preselected and open green. But TSLA has not been pre market yet in the last month that its been pumping. So based on my data. I’d wait to get nervous until pre market. It’s had 2-3 times that it jumps $20+ in pre market. If it stays red pre market we’re probably due for a dip and/or crash

it will pull back next week but will recover the week after, assuming you bought monthlies

You should be nervous, 99% of the time when tesla has a strong day, and putters near -1,5 after hours. Especially on a Friday, the weekend generally builds up tension and concern. This is because like I said, a 99% chance that tesla will drop hard, just like when you drop a duce in the top deck of your neighbors toilet, then when you listen to them from your apartment trying to figure out what that smell is and hoping it will air out... Never does. Just like tesla on a weekend after an AH drop
Still 18days, or 12trading days before Q4/2020 financials, so yeah lots of hype-time. Wouldnt be surprised to see $1000-$1100+ either

I mean yeah, we are. Look how many trump supporters, anti-vaxxers, climate change deniers, anti-maskers, and essential oil MLM tards we have.
Literally have the same chart:

1. nothing much, just chugging along sideways
2. ooh whats options; snap calls went up 10x
3. more more more options; lose 90% of portfolio
4. fuck, more more more options, but this time with less smooth brain, up 50% last two days, down 20% overall
me lol i have 1100c 1/15
I've seen it all. The ex-party dictator who puts his kids/family in charge of everything. The supporters who march into the parliament. The strange rules created to stifle free enterprise to satisfy some ideal (subsidize factories in the rust belt). Trumpo created a generation of Commies, fuck em. I didn't move to the center of capitalism to watch it taken over by commies.

To understand Trump you must think like him.
Well while I'm here at work for my overnight shift, the only thing to really do to be productive is research some plays for Feb/March since my current positions are pretty solid for Jan . Anyone playing financials and commodities such as oil?

(RIOT, TSLA, ARKK, etc).
Yeah I grabbed a couple well OTM SPY puts today to feel like I know what I’m doing.
Yeah that's what's sad is the sentiment holds cuz it's right and sadly there's no alternative.  We just suck as a species.  If we're lucky someday aliens will enlighten us or annihilate us.
Thanks!
Do dogs lick their balls?
Also deep otms are cheap af. Everyone agrees it's a bubble so the fall should be steep. Should. April SPY 300p and VXX 35c are almost too cheap to not play a scratch off on.
Are they risky though? The fed will just keep printing money and by the time the market recovers you'll be back in the green
no he is able to buy them at $750 each share. the strike price is what you pay per share. he paid $500 for the right to buy 800 shares at $750 each

Trump cucked Republicans for at least 8 years
Main "downside" is blunted profit because you're riding the gamma curve up and then selling the increased delta of the option. When you adjust your strike it will bring your delta back down, so if the price crashes you lose less money, but as it rises you'll gain less than if you'd held.

It's also possible to misunderstand your position and get in too deep as with all options. Growing a position with this method like u/ryanmononoke mentioned increases total delta exposure, so you increase total potential gains along with potential losses because you haven't taken any profit to offset the cost of the new option.

I’d check every so often and see the market moon the whole time but didn’t care because I was prioritizing my mental health. Just got back in recently and I feel much more grounded now with a better perspective on integrating a healthy and sustainable approach to trading that won’t leave me filled with regret if a few poor emotional decisions set me back several months or more financially

Very true, but you could also look at that dip as a 15 year buying opportunity to lower your average and now many of those people might be wealthy.
Honestly a 1 minute delay from when you click reply to when you are allowed to hit send would fix a lot. People post quicker than they think, and thus you get word vomit. If a system was in place to force people to think about their comment for 60 seconds a lot would be resolved. It wouldn't even be hard to code. You would still have bots spamming dumb shit though.
Bruh the capital storm was fucking stupid and everyone is condemning it but why couldnt we condemn the stupid fucking blm protests just as hard. Shit wouldnt have dragged on for months and cost hundreds of millions in damages. You dont need to act like an absolute fucking douchenozzle to get your point across and if you feel the need to you probably have a shitty point.

The thing is, algos don't give a fuck about interest rates or inflation. They have gotten so far advanced beyond human comprehension and don't give a fuck about winning or losing money. They know the endgame and were just trying to chase it.

I think these geniuses have opened Pandora's Box and there is no controlling this beast. When people think that robots/ai will take over the world, they were right,  but it's not the robots they pictured in the movies. It's the ones sitting in financial offices in NY, HK, LA and cities all over the world. Algos don't give a shit if there is a massive global crash that brings the world economy to it's knees, they are just computers why would they care? Us humans will be the only ones to suffer at that point...


but hey if you can't beat em'...🤷😉


PLTR 🚀🚀🚀
They don’t want to actually repeal it, it’s a negotiating tactic. “Oh you want to remove political speech you don’t like? Ok then we’ll remove your section 230 exemption and say you’re a publisher and you’ll get your ass sued for every dumb thing someone says on your platform. Oh you don’t like that? Then support us amending 230 to say that you can’t ban political speech”
Probably same thing BLM thought when attacking police officers...

“What could go wrong”
WTF make you think 85% of the peoples visit this sub even know about $VIX, $VVIX, $SPX?

But then one could say that many left wing politicians did the same thing to motivate violence against the state during BLM.

My point is it’s not up to social media or the whole crowd to decide which politicians are allowed to spread misleading info or give weak and sympathetic condemnations of violence. During BLM the democrats were doing it, and now Trump is and if you don’t see that you need to check yourself.
Besides private companies having their own rights, Inciting violence isn’t protected by free speech, article three of the constitution bro. SCOTUS free speech tests will likely be used if trump is federally charged after leaving office (assuming he doesn’t pardon himself)

Why the fuck your think people take out $100,000 in loans before their mid twenties? Because their dumbass belongs in a factory or doing some other manual labor, but now and days most of those jobs don’t pay shit, and the ones that do are extremely competitive. As for why college costs so much, it’s because everybody who DOES have a degree thinks they deserve enough money to buy a lifted 4 door Jeep and go on vacations to Vegas twice a year. I work in education, and so many of these spoiled fucks have no idea what the real struggle is actually like. Then they have the balls to say the government is too big, when most of their paycheck comes from fed loans lol.

I completely agree with you. However Tesla seems like a cult stock with loyal followers and the rest of the EV stocks are just along for the ride. 

My question is, how is it all the big money are following the cultists into this? 

The dot-com bubble went on for a couple years.

 If the EV bubble does the same then we could see the EV bull run lasting until 2025-2030 before the bubble pops no? Because it only started end of 2019 when Tesla had it's first profitable quarter. When the EV bubble does pop, will it cause a chain reaction and dump other tech stocks as well?

I'm FOMOing like mad as I almost bought a bunch when it was trading for $150 pre-split, but I'm on rehab over in r/thetagang where I've been making steady gains instead of wild swings every week while following the rest of this sub.

My guess is that Tesla scooped up all the truly top-level engineers. Look at their Model 3, it’s much, much heavier than a Mini Cooper EV, yet its efficiency is 134 MPGe vs. 108 MPGe of the Cooper. Their tech is far ahead. I have $800 puts EOM. I think Tesla is going to win in the long run, I believe in Elon.

Everyone is expecting a correction right now which is exactly why it won't happen. People are extremely tolerant of blackswan events since we just had one, it would need to be like an atomic bomb going off to crash anything. Maybe a 5% crash, but no one right now is going to panic sell. You are more likely to get dip buyers than panic sellers. Oh and earlier I meant follow the trend and when you get up 100% just throw 50% into a less risky play. Mitigate risk essentially is what I meant not stay away from the market.

I have always been against all globalization. That would include outsourcing, middle class destruction and all that. 

It’s a tough world. The last thing someone that needs to borrow $100,000 is to major in arts or something like that. Is anyone questioning why college cost so much? Nope. These students are woke enough to protest who’s speaking at their college but are playing the whole “I didn’t understand what money is”. 

Any of these guys even writing to their representatives about the college scam? Globalization? Nope and nope.

You think tsla can capture greater than 50% market share? Cuz that's what it'll take for current valuations to make sense. Toyota, with the biggest market share has only 10. Assuming tsla can obtain 100% market share, its price can only go up 2x more. All this is retarded considering how much competition there is in the EV space.

unbelievable
BOTH SIDES
Everything I read just had great explanations for that whole debacle. Apparently random shit stirrers took pictures of the machines out of context, illegally, and possibly before some dumb human clerk error was corrected by their manager (which is what looks like the origin of the issue).

Ive made mistakes at work when first starting a job, and luckily I had an experienced mentor to check me on it. It makes sense to me, and also makes sense why we have like 10 layers of audits throughout the process, in order to catch this stuff early.

I just dont see how an entire country of audit officials wouldnt raise a flag, when we have 75 million people voting for Trump. They cant have all been liberals. I know as an independent, I would have definitely denounced any sort of bullshit immediately. Liberals are generally good people too, they wouldnt let the end of democracy as we know it just slide by.

Plus, think selfishly. People LOVE attention. If you found some secret voting fraud, you would definitely go to the press with your evidence.

This is just too big of something to hide. Check out how many layers of auditing every single COUNTY in US has, let alone the entire State.

im so mad cause when I was extra poor, I was trying to get into stocks and I bought 4 shares of crispr when it was like 50. I had no idea what options were or anything.

In the near future, rich children will have their genes edited to be smarter, faster, stronger, and more attractive.

The elected representatives that call themselves Republicans are an absolute fucking joke. Remember when being republican meant you wanted less government control. Not total authoritarian horse shit while selling out to the top bidder.
Imagine if you yolo’ed it into TSLA calls
Sell TSLA puts, free money.
No, 755.92 is the break even price, which means that is the price Tesla needs to be at by expiration for OP to be net 0 profit. If OP doesn’t sell his contracts before expiration day and holds it through expiration, then it will be auto executed as Long as its in the money, which is any price above the 750strike. So say if tsla was 751 by 1/8, then OP will make loss of 5.93-1 =4.93

When you have a margin account you don’t have to wait for cash to settle like in a cash account. I’m not exactly sure what these fees you are talking about are though, I’ve never seen fees while making day trades with unsettled cash. If you check your account history it should point it out or maybe you should give them a call to find out. 

Oh and I’m not sure if this helps, but your margin buying power will vary day to day depending on what you’re buying and how your account is doing.

Yes, the tards who stormed the capitol were Commies for sure. Coming from a former Soviet republic, I know the drill. Elections don't go well, your 'supporters' storm the parliament due to some supposed enemies, and (re)install the dictator. Fuck the Commies, I'm glad that their putsch failed.

I can expand on that. The looters during the protests back in June were also super coordinated. Essentially looting the same exact way in every city. Driving store to store. The looters is what turned people against those protests and even alittle towards trump.

I could see the republicans planting looters during dem protests and dems planting people rushing those building during trump protests.

Im sure you didnt look at the annual report or any of the income statement when you bought this position.   Only redeeming quality of the company is 83 million dollars worth of cash and cash equivalent. Company is trading at 10x price to book which would have been fine if there was a growth in income but there isn't. Stock price has crossed the upper range of keltner channel let alone 50 and 200 moving average. It's bound to come down. If someone buys this company right now they will lose money.

they also combine it across all platforms to repackage it to advertisers on their end to make a profit and provide analytics

When all the "Big Money" says they're bullish or expecting things to continue or news like billionaire says not to sell a single share of Tesla isn't that a bear signal?
why am i so retarded bro i can’t figure out how to work any of these options price calculators 😂😂😂just wanna know what my PSTH 30 calls 6/18 will be worth when it hits 50!!!! someone wanna help out?
There’s a lot that goes into an options extrinsic value. How volatile the stock is and how much time the option has left are the 2 most important things. As well as how far in or out of the money the option is. 

If a stock mostly stays flat and doesn’t move then the option will be cheap. If the stock is $100 a share and there’s an option for $150 that expires tomorrow then the option will be cheap. Tesla been skyrocketing for the last year means the options are expensive 

Every option is different and it really just comes down to what people are willing to pay for them

Just picked up some of those this morning
As someone that is interested in machine learning and kind of does research in the field, it kind of seems that PLTRs tech is over-hyped and some of its valuation comes from the secrecy of the company. I think if we actually knew what they were doing it would be easy to tell that they're nothing special. Machine learning is cool but business people have made some incredible promises that I don't think they can keep.  Just my 2 cents

it was indeed a hedge. I have some 2022 leaps but I suspect the market (not just Tesla) will pullback a little that’s all.
Tesla will need SpaceX to find intelligent lifeforms on another planet who need electric cars to justify their valuation. This stock is the ultimate meme and will be talked about in college courses for decades.

Fundamentally there’s not much upside in the stock, puts are a good idea. Even Netflix agrees it’s priced correctly rn and won’t see same levels of subscriber growth it saw during the pandemic and that other streaming players have entered. 

However, if they make some content acquisitions (like roku did) or announce some new moves fundamentals will definitely change. Might be a good move tho, there’s definitely upside for leap puts.

1. Not a random company. They have a mine opening in Argentina this year and are getting final approval Friday for the 2nd largest lithium mine in the world and largest in the US. What are batteries made out of for electric vehicles again? O ya I forgot, Lithium. stupid fuck
2. It's not at an ATH currently. Hit nearly $21 premarket and $20 at open.
3. I give no fucks if anyone buys into this position. I'm not trying to get rid of this. I want to execute these contracts and hold the shares. Sold my $12.5 calls for Feb this morning and bought back for $20 Jan calls.
Obviously, because if you were any good at this you’d of only used your rent money once
It's fun. Welcome back
TSLA is the bedrock on which this market is built
Yeah sure... in a country where there are only two parties, your politics don’t say shit about beliefs and values. It’s like having only two colours, black and white. Or two basketball teams
In this case we're talking calls because we're in a bubble going up. The same thing would work with puts on the way down (I did this with PLTR during the gamma squeeze).

Your original position has a given delta, a greek that defines how an option's price moves. Delta rises and falls as the stock price moves closer or further from the strike. Here's a fake TSLA FD example:

TSLA is trading at $850, so you scroll to the top of the call list and decide to start with a TSLA $1200C 1/15 for $1 per share. It's got a delta of 0.015 (1.5%) and you don't mind losing $100 to theta gang for some willy wonka and the chocolate factory type thrills.

TSLA moves to $900. The delta means that for every dollar increase, the call goes up $0.015, so for a $50 increase the call is now worth $1.75, right? Not quite, there's another greek at play. Gamma defines how much the delta moves when the price moves, and it's your best friend because it makes this strategy possible. Gamma on this FD is hella low at 0.0003, but TSLA moves literal boatloads so this $50 move it pushes the delta from 0.0015 to 0.003. The option is probably worth about $230 (pricing equations are complex, I'm lazy, have a rough estimate), and you've more than doubled the original $100 investment.

So you sell the call, buy a new one with a 0.0015 delta for $100 and walk away with a new maximum downside risk of profiting $30. TSLA crashes down because the bubble pops, SEC smacks down Elon and delists the stock, your contract is worthless. You have $30 and walk to KFC while all the other TSLA holders wonder wtf happened.
no need to force already did. tsla 850p.

I think they just need some subscriber growth. I've noticed whenever media always kills a company for months, usually to screw over retail. Everyone loves roku n fubo n shit but none of them have the pricing power like Netflix. I don't know one person in my circle who cancelled Netflix. It's just synonymous with internet tv by this point. International subscriber growth would be a nice surprise
This is real fucking diamond hands

I won't rant here, but the censorship that has happened over the past 10 or so months is quite concerning. I'm not advocating violence, but something needs to change and fucking quick.
Nah man, don’t say that. I don’t know what your political leanings are and I’m not going to ask, but currently this is the political system that we have as sad as that is.

The only way we’ll ever see change to it is if we keep electing the **correct** people, and we can only do that if EVERYONE eligible does their part to vote.

&nbsp;

I’ve lived in this country my whole life, but was just granted citizenship after a ~13 year process. This was my first presidential election I was eligible to vote in and my god, did it feel great to finally participate in something that’s affected me my entire existence.

&nbsp;

Bottom line, I urge you to continue to at least pay attention to what’s going on with politics. Especially if you’re here because crazy enough the market does react to the shit going on in Washington.
Wtf is this gibberish? I don’t give a fuck about your little crybaby bullshit over words I never even heard before. Stop acting like a bitch

No violence is acceptable. Looting during the BLM protests was also despicable. Both parties are rotten. I’m an European that wants to move to America, but second guessing right now.

Are you sure this is how passive funds work? My understanding is that they have ownership targets for various sectors / stocks. If any stock runs up it will be out of range (they will have too much) and they will sell it, not buy more. 

For example, consider a 1M fund that has a 5% target ownership for AMSL. If AMSL is trading at 500 they will own 100 shares. If AMSL runs up to 700 bc/ hedge funds/retail investors like it the AMSL ownership for the passive fund will be out of range at almost 7%. This would trigger the algorithms to SELL ~30 shares.
The problems with that data is that this time everyone is planning for the crash.  MoFos are hedging like crazy, $VIX, $VVIX, $SPX are keep in check and you wont see it move too much out of line.
Lol no it didn’t what’s your source liar

Nah dawg. There was some fuck up where IRS was sending the $600 stimmy checks to the same place they sent tax returns for 2019. Problem is if you use turbotax and opt to let turbotax take their fee out of your tax return, theres like a temp bank account set up where they sort that. They close that account right after taking the fee and then send the remains to your actual bank account. So the IRS was too dumb to know which account to send stimmy too and TurboTax had to straighten them out.
I dont understand gene editing. Like what can crispr change about me?

Bought TSLA stock at $170 2 years ago, this summer figured it wouldn't run more and sold to buy  💩 leaps on retail.  Regretting it ever since.  Did well with the rest of my portfolio though.
I didn't assume it's ending. Bubbles don't have to pop. We have many bubbles going on at once and it's been years and years and still nothing. Covid gave us a taste of what could happen in a blink of an eye but we also learned there's now a cure to bear markets.

You’re confusing the value of the option with the price of the stock. I don’t have the real numbers in front of me but the call is to have the right to buy 100 shares if Tesla for $750 a share. The share price is $880 so the intrinsic value of the option is $130 a share (plus any value the option has left but leaving that out for simplicity). 

He could theoretically spend $75,000 to buy $88,000 worth of Tesla. Or just sell the option for that value (plus any value the option holds). 
Does that make more sense?

all good bro, word of advice, this is a risky game, the greatest skill you can develop to combat that risk is to be patient; sit through the whole video for all the info, don’t fomo on a 10%+ day, wait for the next dip, don’t “cut your losses” on the first red day.. etc.

leg ups occur every so often and when they do, every equities “bottom” rises,

be patient, master the art of “do nothing”

The email literally said I've been banned for "hate speech". 

I looked up the death threat poster and they're there. 

It's not like twitter can blame an automated process cause I didn't say some keyword an algorithm would search for. For "dude" to get reported and get me banned would require an actual employee to review it most likely. 

I'm not complaining that I miss twitter or whatever - my point is it's actually stupidly easy to get banned on the platform, answering the original posters question with my experience.

I am pretty sure Capitol police chef was part of it. On Trumps behalf. He literally said no thanks to FBI support beforehand. Pentagon banned Capitol police from interacting with protesters for other than self defense.

I’ll gladly accept him and retract everything I’ve said. IF, they allow all the evidence to be heard in court, allow it to be put in the open for all to see. That’s why I have a problem. The people that are upset are the ones that know we’re being brushed under the rug. We’re just told by the media, who has zero evidence, that it’s all just baseless. If after all that is done and there isn’t enough to overturn it. I’ll gladly kiss your ass. Until that happens, I won’t stop.

There is downside too.

If you keep the same number of contract, your ATM delta will be reset to 0.6-0.7 (the usual range), but you keep the earlier gain.

And you may be tempted to use the same amount of money to buy 2 ATM contracts, since you can afford to do so. That gives you leverage (total delta is now 1.2-1.4 for 2 contracts) but since the strike is higher, it may expire worthless if it goes against you.

Just imagine if you got in Tesla at $10, by the time it hits $100 you probably have $9K on your position. You can roll it up to 100C (which should cost 1K for mid term contract) and free up the 8k for something else.

Excellent.
Each option is for 100 shares so the $130 is the value for each “share” in the option. And since the option is for 100 shares that $130 is times 100 which is where the $13,000 value of the option comes from

People will interpret them differently. Some of those people are correct, and others are incorrect. To see Pelosi's as the same as Trump's after the past 4 years requires such a lack of intelligence that it's mind boggling.

Turns out you can
Depends your patience and risk level.

Low risk / medium - long wait:
ICLN calls for July or January 2022
-	Democrats control the house, senate, and presidency. $2 trillion+ green energy bill can come out very soon.
-	No brained easy money and a massive position in my portfolio

High risk / short wait:
Option 1. MSFT $222.5 Jan 15 calls 
-	Very weird bullish flow targeting for next week that’s been happening 
-	Blue chips typically do really well when there is a lot of uncertainty. At the moment, we shot up very high and very fast. We could see a quick rotation back into blue chips
-	There’s been a lot of consolidation and MSFT could explode up any moment
-	Very tiny position for my account and almost a gamble

Option 2. Tesla $1000 calls for Jan 22
-	I mean why the fuck not
-	I’m holding 1 of these for fun
Gosh I hope Trump runs in 2024.

Oh look, "true motion" or whatever it's called.

Dumbest thing ever
There's videos all over of Capitol police opening the barricades and then doors and ushering protesters into the building. Protesters run wild through the building, Trump gets labeled as an instigator, dems call for impeachment and big tech moves to shut down access to right-wing social media outlets. It was a good play.
What are you talking about? 
You're describing reverse OMO, where the fed takes money out of the system by selling its holdings of treasury debt. That's not what's happening now with QE. In QE, the fed directly buys a wide range of assets from institutional investors, thereby increasing m0 (the credit base), and lowering the interest rate. The effect is not delayed, it is instantaneous. Its effects can be seen in the incredibly rapid expansion of broad money since the pandemic began. Credit expansion like this typically first exerts inflationary pressure in capital markets, only moving to the real economy later, if at all. That is what we're seeing now.
You weren't part of the seige, were you? Just asking for a friend, not the FBI.

Responses to elections have been escalating for years. It wouldn't surprise me to see dems do it the next time a republican is elected.
She is not expecting a “major” correction, she said it would be wise to take some profits to have cash in case of one so you can buy the dip. She is expecting volatility however.

She did say she was worried bout higher taxes though.

That sounds like a good grasp on things. What are your thoughts on covid and deflation it's causing?

IV question - all of these steel stocks have a relatively low (compares to meme stocks) IV of around 50-60%.

Yeah for sure. I got lucky with this I stayed only a few years so for me it was pretty much the same gang all along. We would usually party after work until 8am every wekend it was a greay. This year is disastrous  for everyone in the industry, hopefully thing get back to normal soon, working in a bar atm is probably disastrous pay wise. I think my tip was like 95% of my income back in the day.
Nice job you magnificent bastard
43 is too high, more like 38. I'm bullish @ 38 now.

Ahh so if I buy a $20c ATM for $50 total premium and then sell it when it hits $40 for say $2k I can then turn around and take $50 of that $2k and then buy a $40c ATM and either rinse and repeat when it goes up more or lose just $50.  Nice.  Still risk the premium on the first call obviously but that’s a better strategy than just buying and holding calls.  Any other downsides/risks?
Buy 🍏 instead
I wonder how many would now? 🤣
Is that Robin hood premium
Sorry 🤭🤫
Said the soy boy
130dollars is the current market value of the contract/share, so one contract is worth x100 shares at 13k. To get the strike price of the option U take the breakeven minus the cost he paid for the contract/share, which is 750

That’s what broke me the most. People I enjoyed working with leaving, only to be replaced by potato faced fucks who didn’t interest me. Also, this year has been absolutely brutal on the industry. My favorite bar that I used to work at is a complete ghost town now and days. It’s depressing as fuck to go there, so I just stay home, thus adding to this social regression in our society.

I think the big issue is that for many politicians, this was the first time they had ever considered just how outnumbered and underprotected they are. Many had never played out what a unified mass of upset citizens would look like as it descended upon them and they had a hard time reconciling the terror they felt as they fled to the tunnels. I mean, they've ACTUALLY been lying about the medical benefits of marijuana and a host of other bullshit laws and here people just THOUGHT they were lying about something and they all damn near got taken out. I'd rush to make some changes too.

You have to use all your 70k first before td uses margin. Once you use your 70k of non margin plus one dollar of margin, td puts -1 dollar into your margin balance. Your positions will be at $70,001 and your margin balance will be at -$1.

The fed only bought about ~10B of debt actually; the whole thing was a big failure. that big QE money doesn't go to any company.

The reason why buying debt didnt work is that the Fed can only LEND money and business just didnt take their offer.

TDA margin question. Just turned on margins yesterday. 

So it looks like I’m not getting any “borrowed money” (say 70k account has 100k buying power), I still only have 70k. Does this mean when I sell everything and buy it back with unsettled funds, I pay fees on the unsettled cash that I used until the cash settles?
not true, fed only bought a mere ~10B in corporate debt and those trillion in QE are not really printed and not put in market; the money is stuck in banks as reserve and bank arent lending.

The effect of QE is lower interest and that drives the market.

The fed can only lend it cannot print.
Any recommendations for a $2k move? I have some extra change laying around.
Is this the current state of social media?? I'm at a loss for both the man and woman in this post. Zoomers are straight stupid with this shit.

who would post a meme on twitter to hype a stock to sell?
If you make it, they will spend it
At least 10 of my coworkers got Peloton's for Christmas. All in on PTON monthlies

Edit: can't spell
each contract is 100 shares. so he had the right to buy 800 shares at $750. the $130 means that each contract was worth $13000 and he only bought them for $500
Some company in South Korea did that actually
WSB has gotten popular enough where it's likely the big boys have their minions or bots measuring sentiment here. If no bears spoke up on this sub, the market would tank hard. 

Bears help prevent the crash from happening because they don't want too many bears to make money.

They are not gonna immediately stop asset purchases. They want market to stop being on a shaky ground and suppress volatility.
If the market comes into its own footings, liquidity will come from our domestic investors and international investors.

The inflow will not continue. It will almost certainly slow down. That's why almost everyone who is not a shill is saying that we are headed towards a decade of lower return. But that won't crash the market. As long as money keeps coming from one way or another, the market will keep on humming.

S&P 500 stocks have already paid the highest amount of money in dividends in 2020 to investors. With inflation coming, it wouldn’t be unreasonable to assume that stocks are going to continue to climb for at least 3 or 4 more years.
i get what you are saying but they didn’t just ban trump. that would be a different conversation. thousands of conservative accounts have been banned from several platforms. how many people did the bullshit at the capitol? a few thousand, maybe? so now millions of conservatives have to bear the consequences? doesnt seem right to me but, hey, funnily enough, i still believe we’re all entitled to our own opinion.

Hey man I have one more question. So it looks like I’m not getting any “borrowed money” (say 70k account has 100k buying power), I still only have 70k. Does this mean when I sell everything and buy it back on margin, I pay fees on the unsettled cash that I used until the cash settles? Thanks

So you’re okay with election inconsistencies being swept under the rug?

All Trump wanted was an audit of signatures in certain states. To audit the machines of certain counties. 

Nothing was done. They got the result they wanted and told everyone to move along. 

Think about the implications of that. Why wouldn’t our elections be transparent? It leaves way too much room to doubt a result. 

And it also leads to open rebellions.

From context I'd say the answer to your question is "oppressed conservative voices." Reading comes easily for me so I am happy to help you out.
How did I know to read this in the tone that you meant for me to read it in.
Seems like shed be burnt out lmaoo
The call to march on the capitol was in his speech the day of the riot. He was banned because of his continued insistence the election was fraudulant, refusal to concede, refusal to attend the inauguration, etc. You don't have to literally say "KILL THE DEMOCRATS" for your words to be inciteful toward a mob of devout worshippers ready to literally bring ied's to the Capitol. His lack of condemnation is *extremely dangerous*. That's why he got banned. Anyone that disagrees at this point is *one of those dangerous people*.

Biden got 11m more votes than Obama? Without leaving the basement? With zero charisma? That adds up to you? 
Like look i get you hate trump because you probably bandwagon on a lot of things . I voted third party but I am still able to call bullshit when i see it.
The angle is the one that makes us money!  If that bothers you, your in the wrong place sweetheart!
Idk what MSM is tbh but if you think the people crying about Trump's loss have any ground to stand on you're literally retarded.
I'd think it's the opposite. You or me don't have the power to move people or opinions.. Heads of state do. Just like Pelosi's husband Is somehow legally allowed to own an investment fund whereas regular people like us are not allowed to own stock in any conflict of interest companies

Great reply may I ask an ignorant question. I’m investing in a Roth IRA this year I’ll buy $6000 worth of VTI. For 2021 should I just throw it in right now or wait until the market dips before the end of the year. Or does it not matter at all because I don’t plan to touch this money for 30 years.

Yeah, that does sound great, if you’re the same age. Get into your late twenties though, and then it becomes clear it’s time to move on. I thought the industry was sad when I finally left. All the students graduate and move on, never having worked hard in their life. While you still slave away at night cleaning the bar until 3 am while drinking and doing coke with the other degenerates. At least I had some good times doing blow and playing darts until 5 am with my buddy.
Why would you sell a SPAC before it SPACs?
The problem is you don’t understand that tsla is not a car company. Whatever the world is worth and then multiply by 25 is what tsla market cap should be.
yea i didnt even understand the email.

This is a fairly small minded argument to make. Interest rates have been rock bottom world wide for a decade and stocks haven’t moved like they have in the last year. If it was just interest rates Japan would have mooned for the last 6 years. The day scrubs in this thread have to start paying rent again and their wife’s boyfriend kicks them out of their apartment is the day the bubble bursts because of necessity to pay living expenses. The bubble is being held up by a foundation of government spending. Wait until rent, student loans, slashed unemployment benefits, and increased taxes start rolling in. Then the almighty bubble will burst all over our faces.

You are literally explaining why we are in a bubble. 

When the risk free rate is 0, where does capital flow? Answer: To risk assets to get a return. 

When the risk free rate rises, what happens to the capital in risky assets? 🤔

Hence, bubble. Funny thing is not all stocks are in a bubble, mainly tech.

I don’t think it’s silly necessarily since U got in low. The main thing that would bind you at earnings is if they offer more shares or something again.  There’s some good articles out there though that showed that with the current dilution the cruise stocks were pretty much already back to their pre-COVID levels. That was a month ago or so, haven’t seen how much they’ve dropped since then. But might be worth looking at.

What the other person said.

No one here is exercising their opinions, we're just selling the contracts back. And those contracts can increase in value as the stock increases. So it doesn't need to get to the strike price, it just needs to increase in value
Must be hard to talk with all that fascist dick in your mouth. Keep going, Comrade Biden will finish soon.

Whereas fiverr is relatively straight forward and is relying on network effects

In other words, easy fro upwork to take fiverrs cake but hard for fiverr to take up works
I wish there was a no politics filter

You or I would have gotten banned years ago for what Mango has done. Only reason it didn’t happen until now is because Twitter had a policy of coddling heads of state. 

That’s why hypocritical elites like Donald Trump have more free speech while ordinary people get less.
it's an interesting topic, not sure where I stand on the legality tbh. conservatives are traditionally against regulation and pro-business, so it was generally progressives making the argument for regulating as utilities. but the egregious and biased actions of big tech have almost forced conservative hand on this. they need to fight back or they risk losing reach and being silenced in the mainstream political discourse.

one thing I can tell you for certain though, this is really bad for the country. it will only inflame the situation more, it will force normal people into places where radical ideas spread without dissent, on both sides. it will make the country more polarized. it will likely lead to violence. bad and unwise all around, but you get the feeling that people like Jack Dorsey just don't care
Fuckk yeah Cathie.

Ehh. One more Biden speech about the “green deal” and that thing takes off even more. Feeling risky
Yea but when you have hella shares at average cost $200.... nothing to really worry about in the long run 🚀🚀🚀
Lol true, I usually don't bother with the CSPs in this type of market as the stock rarely drops to my strike price. If you got the cash you can just buy the 100 stocks, your just missing out on the premium of the CSP leg, but it involves a lot less waiting for a stock to dip. But you are correct if you wanted to continuously run the wheel on the same stock you do need the the CSP leg and some patience. If you don't mind switching stocks and are less patient you can run it like I do.

Pretty much guaranteed to go up under the current administration. An infrastructure bill has immense bipartisan support. Seems to be a no brainer.
Not just this but index fund managers will always cover their positions. So in the event of a sell off; the fund will over discount your position intentionally so they can close it without loss. This has been shown several times already in high volatility instances.
Haha the conspiracy theories are shit to be honest.. Either show proof or gtfo.  But tell me how nuzzling free speech when a person who's almost conceded and has agreed to a peaceful transfer of power is a threat that he needs to be impeached immediately within the next week

facebook has been censoring conservatives forever. reddit sure, for now, in some subs. i know a couple subreddits were banned today. i know its a touchy subject for everybody right now, but my personal opinion is that anyone saying this is okay or justified is just enjoying their hedonistic moment basking in the feeling of being on the “correct” side. take a look back in history and find a time when suppressing political viewpoints worked out well.

To the upvoters of this post, thank you for believing in me. You will be rewarded handsomely. To the downvoters of this post, I appreciate you understanding that criticism is essential to a well-functioning democracy. I value your eager participation more than the upvoters who, quite frankly, I am terrified of. I wake up every day afraid of what they might do. To the upvoters of this post, please ignore that last message, it was likely authored by none other than the downvoters themselves who are desperate to see us fail. They want us to fail so that they don't feel so alone. To the downvoters of this post, what are you even doing here? This post is for the upvoters only. Downvoters are born of trash and will die in trash. Note: I am aware that I just downvoted myself. I was just testing the downvote functionality and that's my bad. If you are an upvoter, kindly forgive me. If you are a downvoter, it wasn't an accident and I'm one of you guys now. Let's fuck some shit up. To the upvoters of this post, thank you for sharing this with your friends, family, and acquaintances. Never give up! To the downvoters of this post, you have succeeded in making me feel bad. Congratulations! Now I have to find out where your house is. I'll know it when I see it, because it will have garbage inside and outside. Stay strong, upvoters! To the downvoters, sorry about calling you guys garbage. You too upvoters, but yes, especially downvoters. You guys are not garbage. You're just regular trash. I hope you find it in your hearts to forgive me. But I have to go now. I just saw another downvoter.

Why would Trump march with them? His supporters already adore him like a cult-leader, so there's no point in taking any sort of risk on their behalf, because they'll love him the same amount regardless.

Why not both
CNBC dude yesterday said the market is a forward looking mechanism, so basically anything in the near term doesn’t matter and to not trade on emotions. So it’s confirmed, civil is bullish, nuclear is bullish, and cyber attacks that take down the entire country are bullish. The market will just extend its outlook depending on the event and look past it.

What if trump was a Democrat plant to kill the Republican party? If trump is impeached a second time he can't run again in 2024, I just read. Coincidence? No, if he ran again he would stand too good a chance of winning. So he had to burn the boats before he left and eff the Republicans once and for all.

Imagine if Trump had actually got down off the podium and led his people arm in arm to March on Congress.  That could have been his most historic moment for better or worse, to look like a real man of the people.  Instead he gave a speech behind bullet proof glass, said “I will be with you!” And then went back inside cracked open a Diet Coke and watched people die and kill in his name on TV.  Even Obama at least marched with BLM in the streets, why wouldn’t Trump do the same?

Elon hasn’t done anything to the oil companies.

Tesla is completely insignificant to them. In fact, the whole EV market is a rounding error.

Part of Elon’s myth is that he somehow replaced oil and gas. Oil likely doesn’t peak until around 2030 in the real world.
Elon stakes X amount of shares as collateral for a low interest loan. Probably at 50% Loan-to-Value ratio. This allows him to keep his shares,  and access liquidity of his assets.

Why? this is all market related. This is not pro or anti trump statement.
America is a very unequal country: money's being concentrated in the top, thus inflation is concentrated there too. Stocks are heavily inflated due to quantitative easing (and that money dumped into the economy going straight to the pockets of the rich mostly)... Look at the prices of houses and buildings, luxury goods, etc. Prices are soaring.

I’m not worried about trump as a whole. I actually do not like his ego or personality. But I will fight for his right to speak and say whatever he wants. And I have looked into it through “unbiased” sources. The Antrim county audit(only one allowed) forums an error rate of 68.4% on ballots. Federal Election Commission standard is .0008% error rate. Kicked those out for manual review. Those reviews never had observers. Never has that ever happened. I don’t follow blindly and I damn sure don’t take shit for my beliefs.

Yeah and so the public float was massively reduced. Which makes it easier for the stock to be manipulated in either direction. Right now there’s bullish euphoria and FOMO on TSLA so it’s shooting through the roof, triggering margin calls on short-sellers. This is the crescendo before the fall.

NIO weekly calls*
Q
thats exactly what I did with SOL this week, easy 60% gain on that option.

Too much of my so-called "strategy" is just staying in solar and renewables, because thats the industry i've worked in 10 years now.  Outside of that sector, I am having more luck with ETFs than stocks, been buying options with a delta around .45 when I see a startling dip.

Also learning not to chase things that already popped.  Talking myself out of FOMO is getting easier and easier. Currently not bagholding any meme stuff for the first time in many months. 

brainstorming any moves next week? My scratchpad is empty

Johnny Chan. It is a good movie.
now you will learn how options are about the price you pay up front, not if it goes your way..

The thing you are not understanding is you are looking at options as if they are exercised or "assigned"

But you are trying to just buy and sell options themselves right? you don't plan on "exercising options" to get the shares right?

and that is where you have the disconnect.

You need to buy options when the price is at the lowest just like if you were looking to buy a stock.

If you want to buy apple, do you want to buy at $138/share or $128/share?

well it's the same with options..

do you want to buy the puts at .68? or .40?

clearly you would have wanted to buy them at .40.. so therefore do some more experimenting buy only buying one at a time options..


I might have to explain it to you.

you got discord?

!RemindMe 52 days
I rode through the split and sold when it got stuck around 400 because they had decided not to add it to s&p.

Similar deal with PLUG. Had calls in December for April that ran up, put a stop loss in that then triggered and sold on a pull back. 

Made money on both, but sucks watching them this week. Fwiw, I think TSLA is great, just not at these prices. PLUG on the other hand is too niche for my tastes and it's trading on hype.

May fomo back in on the next pull back though...

Ya I’m using Tesla as a benchmark. If it stays up Plug is safe valuation wise. And ya FCEL can die for all I care. Plug is actually going somewhere regardless if the stock is currently “overvalued”. But ya know it’s mainly held by institutions.
Hah jokes on you they’d never let me fly people around out here.
I've seen it. He repeatedly lied, saying that the election was stolen, and told the crowd to walk to the Capitol to prevent it from being stolen. 

If you fraudulently call a democratic election illegitimate, do you expect a peaceful response from the people that listened to you? He said fight or fighting quite a lot, and peaceful like once. That kind of CYA isnt going to fly. People died. The Capitol was invaded, bombs were planted, the Congress was evacuated.  

Falsely claiming the election is illegitimate is seditious. The President, Giuliani, and the 147 congresspeople that decided to continue to contribute to that farce are traitors. 

Yelling 'Fire!' in a crowded theater is less dangerous, because that shit won't start a civil fucking war.
i mean, twitter banned him apparently forever, then he tried to borrow other peoples accounts and they got locked too, nothing else besides the capitol being attacked by an armed mob.  Normal 2020s shit
G then Q then F
It must have been dec 22nd when you bought the call since that day price dropped 50 dollars. December 18 was pretty stable .. from what I see there was one point where rpice had dropped 20 dollars. Otherwise it seems to have been rising before then pretty steady.
Depends on how personally involved invanka would be

Forgive if this is dumb but if Tesla just made the S&P 500 isn't it unlikely they would have some massive fall from grace. Didn't all the funds just buy in heavy?
literally did this several times today.
>Deep down most people need to be valued for their achievements.

If your opinion is simply the above then you are definitely correct. But that has nothing to do with my point which is that achieving things post retirement does not mean you have left retirement or that you have not retired.
Just put on the NBC news
This move on twitters behalf is insane and will cause more division. It could have the effect of there being separate platform for progressive voters and conservatives. That will fuel the echo chambers and cause more extremism on both ends. In my opinion this raises the overall risk on all assets by some margin.
This shit literally went up 20% every day for a month. I sold 90% of my MARA shares yesterday. I bagholded in 2018 dont want to do the same so I am limiting my exposition now lol

Here man. I feel ya, my own Mom questions whats real. I hope you are willing to check some sources Ive got about the evidence against tampering.


Look up on google independent, foreign bodies. Or bing it or whatever you want. They do the same examination every single American election, and they NEVER find voting tampering. They always say our elections have tons of observers, and are very protected.

Please dont believe the left or right. Check out these independents. Just because a single human being says something about an election, you dont have to just agree with him. He might be a great dude in a lot of other ways, but even your bro can be wrong about things. 

What if your boy is fucking a hooker and she tells him she loves him, and they are gonna get married. Do you just agree with him that she loves him? Or do you say to him "Maybe get a prenup"?

Dont just follow a leader, you can make your own decisions about this.

The highest they could push rates last time in 2018 was slighlty above 2% and we saw what happened that december..the market crashed and fed had to backtrack..i would say the bar is much lower this time...1%,maybe 1.5%...if they try to push it above that,the market will crash..personally i see a recession in next 3-4 years if not sooner.

Been following the subreddit for a while. Just gotta say as a beta med boi not sure I see the moon on this one. 

In two hospitals I work in there is two ultrasound machines in ER and second barely used, the OR has two never a shortage. I hear you wowow canada sucks, every doc should have one !! The downside/reality is not really. A lot of cases don’t need ultrasound or if they do the 30 ER docs or 70 anesthesia can all just share the one machine like why not. 

Family docs, hospitalists etc can use them you say!! Sure we can maybe buy some more for IVs on each floor. But really there is a big medicolegal barrier to actually relying on ultrasound if you aren’t a trained radiologist. If you have someone with SOB, CP, abdo pain etc can you US? Sure but you still will need some other imaging on top of that along with bloodwork. I’m not convinced hospitals will see a benefit beyond machines we already have besides maybe a couple more. Not sure at least in next ten years docs are putting out money for them. As benefit is questionable. We certainly arent getting tons of US training.

Edit: but you can prob yolo this to the stratosphere but careful on expecting this shit to mooooon 🚀
Lol your post last year
It’s cracking me up
No they are chilling elsewhere
Can't they just create another facebook group or another account? And how the hell do you get your group banned? I am sorry but I couldn't give a single fuck the moment they start gunning down trumpist in the street I will agree with you but having them create a new facebook group to share aoc memes, conspiracies theories or racist meme really is a non story. Also yes every business can use their own judgment and kick you out if you don't respect their rules. Aren't we all mostly for small government? And now conservative seem to want governments to control social media content, it is ridiculous.
I still fail to see the crime here...

decent R/R here imho. just came off 10 consecutive green days with an incredibly massive call-volume day (second only to index day) that definitely could be considered a blowoff.

the only thing i'd be a little careful of is RSI isn't extremely overbought on the daily or weekly yet. if you don't get the down move extremely early in the week i would cut before they pump it to 1000 or something

Damn glad I never got a ticket for this. I don’t know how many options I purchased on a whim behind the wheel! Lol
My position from December was -99%, but the contracts went all the way down to $2 per contract. The risk/reward ratio of adding many more contracts for a fraction of the original position amount made sense to me.

But in reality, I really just got lucky with the timing; it's not much more than that.
How the fuck is the VIX at (nearly) 20???
hard to find a fair apples/apples for ark risk/reward but eg arkk 5yr avg is 15% which is basically $SPY avg.  that 5yr includes 2020, if you exclude 2020 looking at like 2015-2019 arkk is at like 11%/year.  i mean i'm at like -5%/year but still i'm cautious

I can’t say on percentages, which is what normal retards use for the grand high score here. I’m more of a dollar gain person myself and am in the minority for that: gains are gains though and yours is way the fuck up there for both good sir!
that implies ur parents are well off and don't need it anyway (or do they?). personally i'm can be transparent with my gains cuz my parents make way more money than i do so an account of this size would just be like "nice grats, just don't waste it" or some shit, prob a mild reaction. if you suspect they'd have a huge reaction, def keep quiet. personally there are other matters not money related that if it could elicit a huge reaction i rather keep it on the down low.

So if I have an alert that triggered ATH once it hit .51% for large-cap X, 90% of the time it will barrel through to reach1%?  Sounds like you beat the system, except when that other 10% of the time happens 200 times in a row.

works until it doesn't
Well maybe we need legislation to make political thought a protected class if that’s the only way you’ll value it
> There are also movements to break up these companies because of the power they have. They are intact censoring speech. If they control the power to shut down competition, they can't tell you to just go somewhere else. 

Spoken like a true communist. Private enterprise builds a great company that brings the world to your fingertips and becomes worth billions, and you want to break it up because of some made up rules. Commies begone!
Already too deep in gme to buy anything else
There will only ever be 21 million blipcoins ever in existence. This will go beyond 100k soon. MARA literally will print guaranteed
Yup. Only thing you need to worry about is the strike price! Works til it doesn't!
Ooh thanks for the bonus sub
That thaing wiggle tho 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I know I just got the high feeling after seeing these gains and kept going. I need to chill
Yeah, I agree. I have the absolute opposite personality as Trump, think he is a pile of garbage, and I want him to stay on Twat-ter.

The jerk off statement about private companies I argue is outdated, as we are approaching a corpratist landscape where the internet and technology are controlled by like 4 companies. Its like saying "lol, just dont use the internet".

If you are triggered by 2nd ammendment being "outdated" and needing new updates, due to allowing people way too much firepower, but yet dont think we also need the same update for the internet age, you might be a dumbass koala bear and not a fully thinking human
Only 3 LOL

How could you talk about unconstrained spending after the Bush and Trump years? Also tax cuts have the same effect as excess spending. You can’t be against one and support the other.

Probably could have saved some money and brought the date in some.  I can't see the TSLA party lasting until EOY and, if it doesn't, I doubt it will recover by then either.  Either way, godspeed.
Only buy this garbage if you think buttcoins are going to keep going up. If you're not retarded and realize that jan 2018 is happening over again, stay away or go short.

I made the switch in November.

Dropped my 50% VOO and 30% VGT and went 25% ARKK/ARKG/ARKF/ICLN

Best decision I've ever made.

There's a difference between those two bubbles. MBS have a value reliant on mortgage payments so you could time the drop pretty easily by viewing when the Adjustable kicked in. TSLA share price is set entirely on what people are willing to pay and the market is incredibly irrational. Sure it'll go tits up eventually but timing it is significantly more difficult.

Best of luck and may you see many tendies

I think after this bubble, we are gonna need a huge slap to the face to realize that 75% is kinda pretty good
I’m p new to options too!! Yes, u buy a call if u expect the stock to move up. The 21c 3/18 is relatively cheap compared to options for other stocks bc Vale is a low-priced stock, and it’s IV isn’t crazy high rn either. Also, the strike is like 15% otm. I’m not too sure what factors go in to determining the price of an option contract tho, hopefully someone more knowledgeable can answer haha
I will post the loss porn soon
