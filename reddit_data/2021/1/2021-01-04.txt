Didn’t know what options were until April, when I lost $4k trying to learn what they were. Then I learned what they TRULY were in June which led up to a $15k gain

Refer to chapter 24 section 28 in the robinhood manual
Bid and ask. 

No one is stupid enough to actually buy a $25 call. 

So someone put an ask for 0.50, and the bid is 0.01. Robinhood will list the current price at 0.26 despite the fact there isn’t a sane person on the planet that would pay that much for one. 

The guy that listed it at 0.5 doesn’t expect to sell any. He just put it up there in hopes that some wsb retard that doesn’t know any better tries to buy one at market value instead of a limit order.
As soon as you go above 25k, you cannot be restricted

Amazon probably wouldn't notice Alibaba's fall as all the retailer would just switch platforms and the companies regard each other as competition already. And no, most Chinese goods are sold by street vendors and a lot of people don't have access to the internet.

But China has only been open for trade since the 1970's and since then a dozen or so major corporations have come and gone. But most stocks are penny stocks and volatility is extreme, anyway.

It's stupid you have to train just to interview in order to get a job.  You have to train to be competent to do the work, then train a second time to convince people in an interview as well.  

You may be great at your job, but stink at interviewing and could get passed over for someone that interviews well, but is mediocre at the job itself.

But I've bombed several interviews and I'm glad now that I did.  Those jobs were all sweatshops and it gave me a bit of experience in the interviewing process.

Lol you guys are actual schitzo retards if you thought that a reddit comment was enough info to summon the SEC. Short shares aren’t posted to the most recent second as you guys know, it’s possible they shorted before there was any info showing it above 100%. Secondly, proving in court that someone didn’t know something? Good luck getting any form of proof, you’d need someone to literally brag about it.

NDX divided by SPX approximates Nasdaq 100 performance relative to that of the S&P 500.  


Since June 2020, when the ratio opened above the upper bollinger band (a common measure of standard deviation, just like your obsession with Musk's hair plugs is a sexual deviation (not judging))  but closed well into the bollinger band channel it has portended of technology, as measured by NDX, underperforming the broader market.
You can claim up to -2500 in capital gains and that gets deducted, theres a 2500 limit on claiming losses per year but if you lost 4500 total, next year you can claim -2000 even of you dont touch stocks this year

ACB is a long term play. Like 5 years. Buy a couple hundred shares and sit on them. As legalization gets nearer there will be a run on weed like the wild EV mania happening now. Since you will most likely be way up in the position, you use that opportunity to sell CCs against your shares.

That won’t be automatically reported. It is however breaking the rules if you don’t self report. If you did so willfully that’s a big deal. If you forgot, just a penalty. 

The sec makes better computer programs every year. In the past this would’ve required an auditor to take the time and that wouldn’t happen unless you already looked sketchy. These days? I’d be careful. That is easy for a program to spot if it’s parsing the data. 

I am very by the book and don’t intentionally break the rules. Would encourage the same to you!

2dev weekly cc’s like 2% chance to get called. As long as you aren’t selling them the week the real squeeze happens, you’ll just pocketing small bits of premium. Basically if you believe the real squeeze is still months away, then do this for 6-10 weeks.

Yeah yeah i know. I rode GME from 14 to 20 and am blessed to have done so and am thankful for the quality DD performed like yours. I struggle with the bull case and am too scared to jump back in; i think i'd prefer to hit the trend and ride it up a bit.

My dumb opinion is that for GameStop to grow, it has to go three routes, digital marketplace, focis on PC components and games, and distribution/same day delivery from their existing real estate, and get rid of all the retail bullshit they are doing now.

I think this reimagined GameStop fits in nicely between MicroCenter, Valve/Steam and their existing new/used retail model/bestbuy/walmart.

They have a big enough valuation and procurement power to be able to make inroads in those markets. Valve at probably around 6 bil in revenue, microcenter at 2.5 bil in revenue.

Also; i'm retarded.
Wait until monday next week unless you are actually retarded.

My expirations are all June or August
What's your reasoning?
Cool story brah. AAPL ✨✨🚀🌘
Because it makes more shares available for sale putting downward pressure on the stock. 

Credit rating, capital raises, management assessments are all tied to stock price. 

In some cases, stock price can trigger debt to become due (see Enron).

As short interest increases, and in this case pressure on the shorts to cover, can increase the likelihood of stock manipulation (see Tesla). 

Short sellers can, even if it’s a small likelihood, cause a company to go bankrupt. 

Admittedly, I can’t find it right now, but Elon gave an example of that happening a few years ago. 

My opposition to your statement is unrelated to GME, but...

Can’t stop. Won’t stop. GameStop! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

That is still a 40% gain which is good.

DO NOT DIAMOND HAND THIS, YOU WILL REGRET IT. SELL, EVEN IF IT'S BREAKEVEN IN THE MORNING!

I usually sell covered calls so i can tell you straight up if you hold past tuesday, theta will fuck your asshole tiill you can't sit unless NIO SPIKES to 70-80 this week which is very unlikely. 

If those calls were dated further out, i would say hold till the 6th (peak day before Nio day) and sell em then.

Okay listen here. I bought China Unicom long calls last Thursday. Today when the market opened my calls were completely worthless because of delisting announcements. Last week when the market closed I was up 21%. Robinhood sent me an email saying tomorrow is the last day to close my position before I can no longer do anything with my options. What happens now that those companies will not be delisted? I'm fucking ecstatic but still think the news is too good to be true. Are all my calls going to be worthless still and is Robinhood still not going to allow people to trade the stock? I need autistic answers. I NEED ANSWERS!

If you have good risk reward you have bad probability. If you have high probability you have bad risk reward.

There was a really negative piece on SA around 7am.  Basically, it said that QS would never make car batteries and would probably just make batteries for consumer electronics because they don't have good tech.  

Given that the stock had already careened AH on Thursday and in premarket, I can't see how it had an effect.

Well that's why I said they needed to do it a year ago. And no Amazon can't become a gaming destination for all things shiny, new, and fancy. 

Btw, I am not GME gang. just giving my opinion. I am team pray for Democrats and yolo into weed stocks. Aka, a lonely retard.
I invested when spaceX was valued at 36 billion$, since i did it via PE so they took 3% initial fees and will take 20% of profits as carried interest and my stocks will be locked for 6 months when SpaceX goes IPO. Looking back, i could have done it far cheaper via equityzen or forge global but i was looking for assured allocation. 

In private market spacex share was 220 and now it is at 275. There has been certain articles that claimed that it is traded now at 25% premium@275. Challenge with pre-IPO companies that the actual valuation is calibrated during the funding rounds only. Investment is not as liquid as in stock market and you may have to lock money for the long time.

For Elon Musk to surpass Jeff Bezos to become the richest person on Earth, $TSLA stock would need to hit about $801/share. An 8.24% increase. Assuming Amazon stays where it’s currently at
I don't know shit about the stock but as a gamer I find this odd because where I used to go to Gamestop all the time, I haven't been to Gamestop in years I just buy all my games through Xbox or Steam.  It's hard for me to see how they stay viable, seems like I'm their target customer.

Its easy to get 250% growth on ecom sales from nothing lol. You should be more worried that they have so many unprofitable locations in the first place. Them closing businesses stores means there are less opportunities for customers to buy them locally, driving even more people online and when people go online they buy at (no particular order):

1. amazon
2. steam
3. epic
4. PSN
5. xbox live

Gamestop has nothing to attract online customers to their website. People don't even know they have a website and competition in online game sales is absolutely cut-throat vicious. Epic is there burning money handing games out left and right. Bankrupt gamestop can't do that. It's over brah.

I'm not short though. I prefer to play the moon game rather than the short game. I need that $ARCT rebound in me.

Buddy from 15 years ago made me make a promise to not bang his older sister back then. 

Wasn’t a problem because I wasn’t attracted to her.  Like at all. Plus I had a gf. 

Well. Through a nuclear fallout 7 years ago, we stopped being friends. 

His sister became a personal trainer and is 100% my type now and all up in my DM’s. 

Only struggle I have is I truly respect her and would definitely date her, but her brother/my ex best friend can be a huge fucking issue.  

At the same time we are dudes and tend to get over shit quick. 


Just putting it out there. I’ll figure it out.

I believe in $GME’s turnaround and RC’s vision. There is no gaming online leader right now. 55m loyal customers and 66m marketing spend on an average order value of $60. Shut down all the stores and it’s an e-commerce dream. There are $600m of e-commerce revenues alone... co should be worth 4x revenues on e-commerce alone with no store volume.
Fucking worthless stock.
Hello, first time trader here. I have $200 that was given to me to start off and i was wondering if i should buy any stocks tomorrow or wait a bit. Right now I'm leaning more on waiting a bit but i dont know jack shit about the stock market so if someone could help that would be awesome.
How far up is sklz going tomorrow baby?

Yeah, Google has really fallen far from the humble hyperlink aggregation engine of the 90's into this supermonolith of fighting against Facebook for advertising dollars.

It will be interesting to see how "not evil" they stay as their search engine / adwords moat starts to get smaller and smaller. I hope their workers union stands up against some of the dark patterns and terrible standards in the industry.

I'm always saddened to think about the brainpower that could have been spent on other things for humanity other than advertising.

I don’t remember exactly but earlier this year I was looking at companies who worked with genetics and hair loss therapies because whoever finds the cure will be super rich.So I don’t remember much of my research but in China and Japan they are getting closer to a cure and right now there have been a couple of therapies that are in the clinical stage but I’d do as much research into it as possible before deciding what you want to do because I’m assuming you want your full head of hair now and not in 5 years

Read the global minotaur. Issue debt. Countries buy debt. We take their money and print new dollars. Repeat. At least that what I was told. I haven’t read the book
Edit: plus if we print all the money we want, other countries will want to print all they want, too. So, we can as long as no one else does 🇺🇸
Sure, fixed that right up for you.  
[https://imgur.com/a/fAuxAKo](https://imgur.com/a/fAuxAKo)
Yes, de-listing fears off now. It's gonna moon tomorrow. Close it ASAP
I think ur only issue is that Tesla and Nio kinda track together. And since Nio is gonna rally for the next week, you might get rekt.
If there is something you want to buy, and it is $2,000, and you have no way to make the other $1,000, then there would be clear incentive to take the bet. Yes. That person should.
Good one haha

Obviously it will at some point have a pull back or even some offering maybe but this stock is going to be one of the best stocks of 2021. Everything I've read says biotech stocks, genomics, and AI stocks are going to be the next big thing. Tech stocks are gonna crash this year. Way over priced

Thats what I've been thinking. Wsb has become the modern day NYSE.
I literally threw my head back and laughed at the ceiling
This futures dip is from the market pricing in a higher likelihood of both dems winning in GA. SPY doesn’t like higher taxes, even if it means stimmy is more likely to pass. 

Today, though, **we saw how weed stocks respond to a blue senate**. If they gap up again tmrw in the first hour, it will confirm the hypothesis. 

Get in, boys. This shit is the real deal.

I bought shares of PLTR today and sold covered puts. Doesn’t matter if I get assigned cause I’d be buying more at that level anyway. Why just buy the dip when you can buy it and sell it at the same time?
I’m saying the big fish will sell when Biden wins!!! Not some lousy retail fuck. When big dogs sell, retail will follow!!

Based on how many people here react over a 0.5% drop over the past couple of weeks, lots are all in on some short dated calls so even small drops can give them a heart attack.
Unimaginable horror.
Nothing to see here. Futures mean nothing unless green.
200 dollars weed. (1 ounce), 200 dollar bills (1 month, sans food. ) 600 more dollars into Teslas new battery plan.

These numbers dont add up, but they dont need to when you are retarded.

Anyone looking for want something that’s going to go from $15 — $150 check out Origin Agritech. Ticker is seed. 
 
In 2009 china granted Origin Agritech the first bio-safety certificate on one of their gmo corn traits. Fidelity immediately took 10% stake running shares to $150. Today, Xi has new MOA head to push #GMO faster.  Float is 3.1M shares. That’s fucking nothing. This thing is going to see volume, and when it does, it will be over $100. 

Idc if you don’t buy shares and get rich. Nobody followed me when I said Penumbra was going down last time I was here, then it lost 40% in a month. 

Quit buying at the top and take a look at Origin Agritech

I sold a couple of contracts today but I'm still bullish.

If Jack Ma appears and says "sorry, I've been working on the ANT IPO. Thought it was better that I stay out of the public eye while its details were sorted out. Its ready and compliant, here's the timeline", BABA could jump back to its 275-300 range quickly.

Is there anyone who'd say its over-valued in that range?

Yeah, but do your own due diligence and don’t take financial advice from strangers on the internet. Also consider not holding past Friday, due to IV crush once the hype dies down.

Hair transplants go wrong a lot. You only ever hear about the good ones. Id avoid it unless its something you really want. Eventually you become okay with being bald. If you're just starting to bald you can take .5mg of finasteride daily to slow it down to a halt but not reverse it. As soon as you come off It though you lose it again. Being bald with a beard is dope though so if you can grow a beard don't even fret. Also don't go to turkey its cheap but they get people who aren't even doctors to do the transplants and don't tell you that. Its not worth someone fuckjng it up and looking ugly as hell which does happen frequently.
Df is BNGO and how much are we buying tomorrow
Your calls r fuk. I'll just short NQ. Just like today.
Like the rest of the sub, *I’m no expert*. But from what I understand CCL has diluted their stock by adding shares without adding value (just to stay afloat- no pun intended) and the old $50 price is now equivalent to $30~ or so if they were to hit their full potential again. 

I’ve also been long on CCL but considering getting out here lately

Split the $1200 between PLTR AND GME. Also increased margin and split that between the two. Lol doing my part.

Over 900 GME shares at $18.16
Over 550 PLTR shares at $26.31
As I said on another thread: 

The delisting should have gone forward. Take a look at the OTCs; all the absolute dogshit penny stocks are blatant Chinese pump-and-dumps, intended to do little more than defraud unwary American investors. This country would sell out its own mothers to get a quick buck. And this intransigence to stand up to Xi's China--to not even be able to so much as follow through with a simple delisting--will eventually result in no more bucks to be made, after they've all been siphoned offshore and all our IP is ripped off. 

Pooh wins again.
Warnock is -220 over Loeffler at Bovada and -175 at Betfair, where Loeffler is +125.

This is what I wanted to do..I have been burned a lot buying OTM calls so this time I wanted to try butterfly spread strategies..due to 1) VIX being high 2) I’m only aiming for 25-50% profit target so butterfly spreads have higher probabilities. Butterfly can let me buy very close to ITM and they are much cheaper than naked calls.

If the company is able to reach a high free cash flow and therefore pay a healthy dividend it’ll be priced in relation to the yield and expected turbulence in the future. For example their expects EBITDA in 2023 of about $250M and their 118M shares outstanding gives that an EPS of slightly greater than $2.00. Let’s say their increase their margins by moving downstream to making magnets and prices of NdPr go up and they could reach possibly $4.00 per share this decade. If they pay 50% of their earnings out, which is possible as they don’t have debt, then that’s $2 per share per year that could realistically be seen this decade. If the market prices that in at a 2% yield that is at $100 share price. That doesn’t include the future growth factored in in pricing growing companies. All those are back of the envelope calculations and I can’t promise that’s how they turn out but that is how I approach the valuation of the company

This post is so fucking retarded yet fills me with so much undue confidence
So much humble bragging to strangers up in here. Pussies.
The USA sets the tone, always. We have the ability to crash or prop up anything we want. 

If you don’t understand that, well, you’ve got a lot to learn.
Why do you do this to yourself. You're even more retarded than PLTR and literally inching closer to the NKLA spectrum

Check GME price history, you could be down -30% for MONTHS before getting to +200% returns. That's why I am 100% in shares and cash (for the dips) but the trade strategy is up to you if you think the catalysts can push the price up before your calls expire.
oh really? which techniques or methods?

I have no idea. I’m just talking about something I’m not following & saw this video you’ve never heard about thanks I’m a jackass. Your life’s to do list must be a baffling document
Unless you started a job in the middle of 2020 and your reduced income saves you on capital gains. :) but all else equal I agree.
best part of my day is reading up all the juicy [WSB DD posted about PLTR](https://swaggystocks.com/dashboard/wallstreetbets/ticker-sentiment/PLTR) after a long day of work
What calls are you in?
NO  

Youtube search how to play ETF's. Find a system that you like. There are great theta strategies. Some people play naked monthly's, weekly's, dailies. That is a lot to unpack here though and prolly inappropriate. 

/r/options has a newb thread to ask questions and a great sidebar. The community is mixed imo. I learned alot from the Chicago Mercantile Exchange Options Industry Council free courses here:  https://www.optionseducation.org/videolibrary no bells or whistles. Dry as fuck, but only mechanics. Back test that shit paper trading.

Don't pay for courses. But watch different youtubers with different trading styles for free to find the style you like. Usually the old guys with small followings.

Just stay away from pumpers. Anyone making money doesn't need to pump shit. Although some here would consider me posting my plays here pumping. 

And mostly treat WSB as your place to blow off stress and camaraderie........ and to watch retards and autists like me blow up accounts.........Don't get to consumed here or eventually you will get banned.  Good luck bro.  PM me if you have any other questions.

No, I get that, plenty. I've made money off Tesla and other future bets.

The difference is that those have future expectations of very high growth, very scalable profit machines. That's exactly what I'm not seeing in BNGO - how will their business model, even years into the future, generate rapidly scaling profits? They're only selling to high-end labs. They're never going to sell Saphyr to aspirational consumers or millionaire consumers, or even mid-budget hospitals. Even Virgin Galactic has a larger Total Addressable Market. How will BNGO make a billion dollars, or even tens of millions of dollars a year, ever?

> It’s important to remember that the goal of every growth company is to eventually turn into a steady dividend company.

Yeah, dividends are boring but if the company is set and the industry is stable there’s no point in growing and there’s no point in letting too much money sit in the company bank account. Dividends let it sit in your bank account, and employees retirement plans keep looking good so they watch out for the company’s long term a bit better.

I think this is a little bit doomsday. At some point a bit of a selloff will come anyway, but the cash isn't going to leave the market. Dividend stocks would probably have their moment if that happens. I kind of think once things normalize you're gonna see a lot of money leave Tesla to those stocks anyway. It's a safe haven for rich people during the pandemic.

* Can confidently say I take at least 200 orders per shift (most coming from lunch and dinner rush)
* Convince at least 3 cars per day to sign up on Robinhood or WeBull so we get a free stock
* Most free stocks are 3.50ish dollars
* i only need to get about 100 referral codes out there to make back a $1,000 loss, which would take about 30 work days to do... this, this might just work

I didn't try to time the market to get a perfect entry but yeah might very well be the case.
It has nothing to do with the company but rather their stupid ipo lockup agreement.  They started with 50 mil float, first lockup lift this week adds 37 mil shares, second lockup lift adds 380 million shares in March. Their average daily volume is 3.5 mil. Mix this storm with their immediate run up and you have a recipe for a shit load of investors looking to cash in their huge profit. All them holders including Buffett got their shares at like 20$. They were predicted to IPO in the 80-120$ range then doubled on actual date for no reason.

I told one of my retired friends from FB about Nio after he followed me into the Tesla split. I told him it was probably too risky for his portfolio. He didn’t listen. He told me today he’s ridden it up 3 times these last few months, is up $30K of it. Apparently he took that and bought 7000 shares of STIC because I told him I’m following Sir Jack.

If the stock trades sideways for a while, the stockholder wins (edit: relative to the call holder, I should say). The call/leap holder loses.

If the stock is for sure going up, then of course the leap wins. The problem is that you don't know for sure if that's going to be the case.

I think DOCU is getting ready to break out. It’s been consolidating in this range for a while, and the gap between the 50 and 100 day is narrowing drastically. Run up to ER and a beat could really move this thing. But I am retarded, so there’s that as well.

Does HK sell off BABA cause we sold off or do we sell off because HK sells off 🤔

In theory their market opens before ours (Sunday night) so it seems as if they would be setting the trend, but on Friday’s we close last, so they could be reacting to our Friday close on Sunday night.
We know 🌈
I think it is more institutional sentiment than anything, it’s like if Jeff Bezos disappears tomorrow will it really impact anything? Not really, there are systems in place to replace the next day. Decision making is made at an executive team level. Retail by Amazon is determined by Dave Clark not Jeff...

However if Jeff Bezos disappears suddenly due to bad mouthing the Us government, it is not really positive for the markets view on the country and whole systems accountability. What the fck will happen to my money if USA decides something on a whim and closes down my assets, which are foreign owned? Won’t happen right and unthinkable in the US? But not in said scenario here.

So here's why I'm convinced this is a good play.

At this point RC has to know that there are a million and a half autists betting on him to do something here. If he had no intentions of a hostile takeover, there's nothing stopping him from coming here and telling us that's not what's happening.

However, if he is moving towards a hostile takeover, there's a lot of reasons to be tight lipped about it outside of official disclosures.

Furthest expiry he could roll forward to was 2022
This reminds me of Mikhail Khodorkovsky so badly, once the richest man in Russia, had everything taken away from him +10 years or so in prison, google this fascinating story for details

Nobody believed Putin would do him that hard at the time and get away with it , but he did. I think Yukos was a publicly traded company, a Fortune 500 (worldwide), got broken into pieces and given by Putin to himself.

I kind of like Jack Ma, hopefully he doesn't end up being China's Khodorkovsky

But for now, they have 0 news, it was a clear pump and dump, 0 product, tons of competitors. I have no doubts it’ll keep dropping to 20-30s unless 1 of 2 things happen. Another pump and dump, or they announce something really good. But if nothing happens, it’s gonna keep bleeding.

Lol chill. I’m not saying it’s okay that this is happening. What I’m saying is the chances of survival at that point are very slim. I agree that the ICUs shouldn’t be at max capacity but they are because we haven’t gone on real lockdown this whole goddamn time unfortunately. It’s a sad reality and I posted that fact to show that although it sucks, it won’t make an EXTREME difference overall. If I was in charge of shit I would’ve locked this bitch down back in March. But that didn’t happen and now everyone is suffering.

I use quite often actually.  Did I somehow give the impression that I don't use cannabis somewhere in my post?  Or are the people responding just too stoned and/or dumb to read?

Should I go to that friendly neighborhood scumbag that is always looking for their next score at others expense?

Provide him with cash that he can kick back up to his actual supplier that is much higher on the crime chain?  The one that also dabbles in small arms and other crimes?  Do you think these guys are selling from their own private stash?

No seriously.  Let's debate this further.

I'll start.  I believe these friendly neighbourhood weed guys are useless pieces of shit that contribute nothing to society, and actually cause it harm.
Oddly specific, I concur

Ya, I try and live minimally because I don't like waste. But only renting and owning like a backpack and a laptop and 2 pairs of clothes is retarded. Plus the lifestyle they promote basically requires you to be a multimillionaire and spend all your money buying temporary shit. I like assets.
Didn't you kind of answer your own question though? why not just follow the subreddit dedicated to Pennies?
Sell and move half into late this year and get something itm Or close OTM if you want to gambool on NIO day returns.
I live in San Diego. It's a small town 😉
that is why I said 1. it's a good stock, 2. it's a leap, 3. you can still close position, 4. u can hedge with selling weeklies OTM
What happens if they get delisted? Asking for a friend
Yep. I missed out on so much money every time I said it’s too high. Finally pulled the trigger starting December. I’ve bought FDs every week and a few leap calls. All of them have printed me money and TSLA alone is carrying my account. I’m up so much money because of TSLA.
Call me out if I’m wrong but I’m sensing you don’t believe the quote. I know it’s true that the market performs under a democratic president but I’ve never seen the figures laid out like the OP presents them.

For most it’s how they self identify. For others, they spend too much and the perks are too great. 

For instance, some get all their expenses paid by the company, food, private jets, hotels etc and extend their stays to take vacations. Once they retire they aren’t invited to the same places and all of that is out of pocket.

But for normal people, you put away a few million and you can post up if you’ve got passive income from things like rentals. 😉

CRLBF a better buy for US exposure but I am likely biased as I am close with their executive team. Also not available on RH as it's Canadian OTC.

All of that said, you might be higher than me if you think there is a non zero chance of federally legal weed in Q1 2021, or any point in 2021 for that matter.

Even with the dems having full control, things will still move slowly and will absolutely not be a priority for this administration in 2021.

I do believe it's entirely possible it's decriminalized in 2021, but it absolutely won't be federally legal on that timeframe.

Pot is one of my hedges against everything else that gets F'd by dems getting full control so I wish you were right, but pretty sure you're not.

Relevant positions: CRLBF 1000 shares @ $5.63.

“In a major reversal, the New York Stock Exchange said it no longer intends to delist three Chinese telecom companies following an  executive order by President Donald Trump.

The answer to this isn't "well, they weren't likely to live, anyway". It's " we shouldn't have overcrowded ICUs to where people are given up on before common practices" 


https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK541113/

Going from *at least* 20 minutes to *at most* 20 minutes is a big change. 

It's easy to say from your armchair, but you (as usual) don't think about other people who may have lived if the ICU wasn't overcrowded and paramedics could spend just an extra minute trying to get them to live. 

Because, guess what.  They're not talking about COVID patients.  They're talking about anyone who for any reason needs resuscitation.

I actually don't know, but here's what I'd say. Not a big fan of selling naked puts or calls. If you just buy shares  you have unlimited upside and limited downside. That's the kind of trade I want to be in.

Check GME price history, you could be down -30% for MONTHS before getting to +200% returns. If you sold naked puts with short exp. you could have been destroyed short term while the stock went up insanely mid term.
And you’re being useless by not making any suggestions

No. I’m sorry. You’re wrong. Look at a 1 year chart, it spent most of the year trading around $6. When it broke out of that range (you get in) then skyrockets up to $20 and then stagnates and doesn’t hold 20, get out for a 300% gain. That’s how you trade stonks.

I love the National Reconnaissance Office. The rest of the government tries to pretend they're transparent, responsible stewards of our tax money uninvolved in any shady conspiracies.

Also all these permabulls since when did that shit happen in this sub after a virtually 10+ year run up during a pandemic.
APHA sank quite a bit after the TLRY merger announcement (oversold, in my opinion), so that's probably what I'll look at. But some of the smaller stocks might run up more if the senate flips.

But for a safer bet, wait until Wednesday, then: 

If Dems win = buy shares immediately

If Reps win = wait a few weeks and buy shares

There's still a decent chance cannabis has some libertarian-type votes in the senate if they want to bypass McConnell. That or executive orders by the Biden admin.
That part of the series gets a lot of hate. I thought it was cool if not maybe a little long. Amazing acting, writing, and characters. My favorite being Richie, his sister’s bf/husband.

This is an opportunity for them to reset debts and borrowing rates.  I believe real estate will continue to appreciate. The properties they own are located in high-end areas. I think you will start seeing transition of some of their properties to town centers with residential conversions of vacant space, as you are seeing with other high-end REIT’s.  What I like as well is the short squeeze that is setting up.

You have a catalyst soon (see the timeline table) but honestly not gonna lie here, I am not a fan of such short expirations. I wouldn't go for any calls before July at the earliest.

It could be if the Dems gain control of the senate. The uncertainty for market makers knowing that Dems could write any policy they want without resistance would be bad for stonks. Mainly due to their stance on higher corporate taxes, taxing capital gains as income and other tax increases. That’s bad for business and in turn bad for stonks. 

I believe Cramer talked about this to a while back on how a split Congress is the best environment for stonks.

I think the GA senate runoff is a toss up to slight R favorite, so I'll probably buy some OTM lotto weed stock calls and puts.

Game over for trumps.stock exchange won't listen to him
Biden is not gonna come in and start burning policies left and right and handing out taxes. He's taking over at the peak of one of the biggest bull runs ever. He wants this shit to keep going too. He wouldn't want to be THAT president that enabled a true bear market in the middle of the worst modern pandemic. Biden is actually decently moderate in terms of big business. Obama was the same way and the markets did pretty good under him while Biden was VP.
howd u get beaten up by soyboys?

He’s not even ceo anymore. It’s just bad optics. I’m guessing him and ccp agreed that he would go MIA for a bit to send a message and to scare people who were thinking of messing with the party. He is untouchable and so is the ccp.

In other words, baba calls.
How do you really feel about it tho?
No, they have shown interest though. There is high speculation they will enter once FDA approval is gained or before.

The 5+ year death spiral is of no concern? Truly curious as it seems to be dropping about 10% per year, why all of a sudden would it start going up?

Everything runs up. The point is it's on the radar now and probably going to rise further based on the info.

Of course this stock wasn't allowed in wsb because of the rules they put. r/pennystocks is all over this stock. Managed to get in @ 1.02 a share. Got out expecting a pullback today.

The country literally drove it’s military through it’s own protesting citizens, ran over the mangled bodies of peaceful people with war machines, massacred hundreds or possibly thousands of it’s own innocents in a single event, shooting at civilians in their homes for even looking out the windows, burned the remains of corpses in the streets, sprayed the ashes of the road with hoses, then imposed penalties for speaking about the atrocities... 

But, wow, it sure scary that a billionaire could get snuffed.... 

He knew he was taking a risk.

Just a reminder, wealthy people that threaten the powers-at-be aren’t safe here, either. Epstein didn’t kill himself. (Granted, he deserved death. But only after going to court.)

Jack Ma has always been a puppet. He clearly isn’t smart enough to start the worlds second largest e-commerce company. Have you seen his interviews? The fact that he was dumb enough to speak against the CCP proved that.
I don't expect it to. We would either have to just flick each other back and forth, or condemn the entire world. Probably just gonna touch tips and call in a day.
I also do spreads so I sell a higher strike call to offset cost and get some credit upfront, then I exit the portion Iv written (aka the call I sold) if stock goes down so I can make money on it

(Please don’t ban me for another 7 days mods)
Yeah investing is buying Apple or Tesla then get out when you want to buy a house or retire. What we are doing here is much more. We are sending the big capital firms a message. It is not about the money! (Because frankly we are out of them already).

There are not big margins in these vaccines. Plus, so many people don’t even want to take it. Look at it from a pure product perspective. Untested, version 1 being injected into your body and you will need boosters or more versions. That’s a shitty product.

Sell your shares and open a bull call spread. You can gamble 1/10th the amount of money and make the same profit. If you are wrong you are out $800. If you are right you make $500-1000 depending on how retarded you get with your spread.

Eventually, all things merge into one, and a river runs through it.

Without Jack that means the company will be partially nationalized.  The profit of the company will flow directly to the chinese government.  There is a reason the chinese stock exchange has gained so little over the years despite hundreds of percent gdp growth in the last few decades.

No. The March calls are for 2021. I'm just hoping I can break even on those. Down about 70% but I loaded up quite a few more contracts to help climb out of it faster once.

>don’t apply to virgins like us. Did the study look at many FTDs around stocks that had such high short positions?

Yeah it didn't cause Lehman brothers to go under or impact the whole market back then. That doesn't mean it can't toast a stock short term. It's not out of a playbook for these hedge funds (if they want in) to short sell naked and trigger stop losses, once the pandemonium starts they purchase to cover and add. Or they'll start a sell off.

Would this also be a good play for ETFs that show consistent growth, or does a lower IV kill spikes in call prices? There are tons of ETFs that have well over 120 day support levels. I guess it all comes down to identifying and jumping on a good buy signal.

Thanks so much for hitting me back. I’ve been studying this stuff non-stop for the past couple months and I’ve had no one to talk to about it, and I’m only just now familiar enough with terminology to start interacting with the community here on WSB.

At first i was calculating how much $ to leave in my bank account to buy the maximum amount of PSTH without overdrafting when the autodraft bills come around, but instead decided its better just to transfer as much as the bank lets me and eat the overdraft fees.

when Roku first went from 216 to 238 the news was that HBOMax would be soon.  When it went to 280 to 320 same thing was said.  Now that it happened and it hit 360 what is there to keep it going higher?

That makes a lot of sense. BNGO doesn't have much of a cash runway (~12 months), so a share offering seems likely. Any dilution could be a good entry point if the overall upward trend holds.

Keep an eye on the FDA approval and institutional purchases. I have a feeling that if approved we'll see much more aggressive institutional buy-in.

If they can streamline the game buying process, and focus on the NON GAMER aspect more, then I see them doing really well. Imagine finding a game on their site, choosing the platform, purchase type (personal or gift), and product type (instant delivery digital or 2 day shipping physical copy). 

You'd be surprised how ridiculous it is to buy digital games sometimes and be sure you're buying digital and not a physical copy. Also, nintendo doesn't even allow you to buy games as a gift for someone on switch. You can only buy a GC and pass that along. GME has potential, they just have to act on it last year. 

Also, if they could focus their brick and mortar more on hype (limited releases, brand new games stocked only..etc) and add a MSFT sponsored PC section (picture RGB orgy, liquid cooling, all the pooh and ahhh stuff), then there's a lot of room. Especially if they can attach themselves to the idea of gaming PCs. "Need a gaming PC? Gamestop got you and will even throw you .00005 cents for last year's console to go towards your purchase!"
He’d ban and then unban...

Why wouldnt the steel companies be able to maintain the same margins? If you maintain a 20% margin and your supply price increases, you can maintain the same margin and pass that price on to the consumer. This is especially true in an environment with low supply and high demand. 

Steel is starting to see the same price increases that iron did last summer, we just havent seen the peak yet. It's been gaining at 30% month over month. We're gonna see big surprises with some of the undervalued, smaller US-based companies

China Telecom

Yes even before the 40% drop. I studied QS options in depth like around 1.5 weeks ago when it was ~110 (I have a post in my history about this). 

A reasonable put you coulda bought was like a way OTM Feb 60 put in which case it woulda like 3-4x with this drop from 110 (so more than the 40% drop too) and most other reasonable puts did 2x from last Thursday right before the 40% drop today. If you chose a way OTM one there was super short dated it coulda been a lot more but that's not really reasonable.

i assume you pulled this info from SEC yeah? nice graph! Since the institutional ownership is 122% as of latest reports I see, does this suggest that the institutions are supplying the shorts with shares to sell? If so, does this imply that for the short squeeze to happen, institutions need to start making margin calls and apply the squeeze?

&#x200B;

edit - ALSO is there a reasonable explanation for this, like there is always a percentage of shorts undelivered due to simple reporting issues, and that a huge increase in short position would cause an administrative and expected spike like this?

That depends on your risk tolerance. I would enter 5-10 minutes after to see if the level holds. A less risky approach would be to wait until a close above.

The "market" actually likes uncertainty.
When there’s millions of mail in ballots already, it’s in the bag
Holy shit he actually said Amen and Awomen
This analysis is spot on and I have been saying it too. If you were monitoring futures during the election, you will know that, despite the presidency being uncertain at that moment, futures shot up once it was clear Republicans would take a 50-48 lead and no blue wave materialized. The implication was that record tax cuts and regulation cuts from the Trump administration would remain going forward regardless of who won the presidency because the Republican Senate wouldn't allow anything else. Stocks were down today because of the projected Democrat win of both seats.
That’s incredible!

I mean.. you can simply take 20-30% profit if it rallies this week after today’s drop. That’s my plan.
Depends on the sector. A split congress is better for stonks. A one sided congress and presidency that is pro increasing corporate taxes, making capital gains taxes as income and other tax increases is not bullish for the market. It would drive renewables in the longer term, but the market would have a bit of a selloff most likely until intentions in policy are made. The uncertainty is the problem. Anything they want to push through would just happen and that is bad for businesses. 

I actually don’t care for politicians in general, but you have to understand how they effect stonks to be a savvy investor. Today’s selloff was about Georgia.

I hate to say it, but if you fuckers would have actually bought stocks and held, like you say you did, we would have steamrolled Citron on PLTR. 

Instead, they called our bluff and we got felted.
politicians are do nothing assholes that speak out of both ends

I personally know some PhD students and you're not fuckin' wrong. A few of these mofos are outsourcing their research from Upwork or Fiverr.
He wasn't a vote against Hillary. He was a vote against Congress. Why do you think so many Bernie bros went for Trump? Because he occasionally does shit like read a bill full of pork aloud and demand 2k checks. He claimed he was going to fuck off from the Middle East War, which has taken him fucking forever, and he was for tariffs, which protects people from being outsourced.

2024 better have a populist who is sane and not a million years old,. I have no faith in the GOP, although they are... pretty volatile.

Well I can tell you offhand it's equal in valuation / market cap to the next 9 companies.

Car sales is 1 for TSLA vs. 121 cars for those 9 largest companies who collectively have the same market cap.
We should make this into one of those coins they always gave out on base to say good job instead of giving more money.
I think before the lockup, there will be a major surge of stock price as there are many events upcoming, so maybe buy it now is the right time, and sell it asap before lockup, then buy it again after the lockup
I'm 50/50 on either a) sell everything tomorrow and buy back in when the madness is over and b) uninstall my trading software and check back in 3 months.

Yes technically.  You know that scene in the first Avengers movie when Loki had all the people kneel before him and says something essentially that it’s the natural state of man?  Well he nailed it.  People don’t actually like freedom so we just keep electing assholes who like power over and over, while blaming the opposite party.  The power consolidates, we end up with a wealthy and political elite who essentially do what they want, then all of us peasants get to live out our lives thinking we actually accomplish anything significant with each election.   We all like to claim the retard and autist card here but the reality is the vast majority of people are utter morons.

Best tinfoil hat I can make atm is that Ma is actually the evil conspirator sowing a tale of misdirection to the global eye and then kidnapping himself to further throw suspicion on the current administration. Then when he's ready he emerges from the shadows to take control of China and begin his evil plot for world domination.

Both parties want to crush tech for completely unrelated reasons. If congress is split, they'll fight each other. If congress has a clear winner, from either party tbh, then it's time to crush tech.

Democrats want tech to stop being so good at capitalism.

Trump is done as a politician. All any candidate has to do is mention 350k dead and voters will flee. You can think otherwise but he only won the first time as a vote against Hillary. He won't win against neutral opponents.

Plus all the pardons and corrupt shit at the end which was confirmed and there isn't enough red states for him anymore.

It's not the amount. It's more the timing, so many of them are January calls! Clearly OP is not a leaps guy.

- Solar - stick to the ETFs, TAN, ICLN, QCLN, SMOG, FAN - S O L as a sleeper

He's actually a fiscal conservative. Trump actually probably doesn't realize that. I like trump because he pisses dems off but he fucked up here. Hopefully there's enough rally to pull 1 win so we can deadlock the senate for 2 years causing massive stock tendies. Trump's doing a rally right now for georgia actually.

JnJ has 3 business units: 
Pharma: doing very well
Medical:tough year, decline but not
Consumer: first time they will overachieve, partly their fever drugs used for covid and recommended against competition. Their results will be stellar, compared with a successful old school covid vaccine, I see 20% upside by February. Compared to Azn or PFE, JnJ is leaner and better managed. Nobody is selling JnJ it is in all retirement funds so it won't go down. It is already moving up.

As far as I am aware, the broker will cover for the shorter. Have you ever heard of a call contract being exercised that wasn't filled? The broker fulfills the contract, and now the shorter owes the broker. 

This goes about as well as you might usually think. How the brokerage reacts exactly - fees, interest - depends on the brokerage and the size of the bill, but there are usually lawyers involved, and their lawyers are way, way better than yours. 

As far as responsibility goes, it wasn't the broker who wasn't able to cover, it was the shorter. Brokers are required to have a certain amount of capital on hand for emergencies like these. If the shorter was naked shorting - shorting non-existent stock - that's illegal. Shorters are supposed to borrow a stock or otherwise determine that it exists first. If they're doing something funky to get around that, it's the shorter's fault. If the broker is allowing the shorter to short nonexistent stock, that's illegal. 

Who is at fault is what the court system or the SEC is for.

This actually fairly untrue and has basically zero to do with dem or rep. Dems and reps have ideologically not only flipped multiple times but similarly with reagan trump is a populist causing certain rises here and there. Not to mention the recession under obama was caused by [clinton era uniparty stupidity.](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2009/05/bill-clinton-accepts-responsibility-for-the-recession.html) So much so clinton publicly apologized for it. It just depends where the person stands ideologically. Also most presidents have basically nothing to do with the stock market unlike trump whom attempted to push it higher. For example clinton has what the second best stock market ever? Under the dot com tech boom that shaped stocks to this very day? I mean he didn't MAKE the internet. That was entirely circumstantial.

Fuck yeah I do, just started rewatching the series again in preparation for the movie in March.
If we said Jack ma had evidence, would 🥭 find him
Nice. Well done.
No, he has a couple of scenarios where he sell the shares at as loss and come out better than diamond handing it.

One option is he can sell the shares sell $27/28 weekly puts.

He'll get assigned the shares close to his original cost basis and reduce his cost by the extrinsic premium which is higher higher for the put than selling a covered call at the same strike.

Another option would be to sell at a loss, then use a portion of the proceeds to buy 65-80 delta ITM calls in the upcoming earnings month.

He could then reappropriate the remaining funds to other investments or into risk defined put/call spread combinations based on short, medium, and long term anticipated stock moves

He could decide on a strategy that mixes any of the above.

There's plenty you can actively do besides sitting around nursing a huge loss.

Nasdaq delists a stock that doesn't maintain a price above $1 for 30 consecutive days and considers it in compliance if the price is above $1 for 10 consecutive days. This creates a buffer to avoid delisting and relisting constantly. 

We could have a similar threshold for the $1b market cap. It will take care of sudden spikes/dumps and respect upward/downward trends.

Buy the dip
>In the city of Yiwu in eastern China, the authorities turned off streetlights for several days and ordered factories to open only part-time. In coastal Wenzhou, the government ordered some companies not to heat their offices unless temperatures are close to freezing. In southern Hunan Province, workers have reported climbing dozens of flights of stairs after elevators were shut down.

>Large swaths of China are scrambling to restrict electricity use this winter, as the country’s rapid economic recovery from the coronavirus pandemic and unexpectedly frigid temperatures have sent demand for power surging. Officials in at least three provinces — where a total of more than 150 million people live — have issued orders limiting energy use, warning of potential coal shortages.

This isn't anything anti-communist related, just the truth. Right now the face of their business (Jack Ma) is "missing." It isn't a good look. The fact that there is essentially ethnic cleansing going on there also isn't a good look. There is a lot of volatility surrounding China. Are there opportunities in China? Of course. Look at NIO. Look at BABA. Is there a ton of volatility? Yes. Is anyone concerned about doing business in China because of this? Yes. That is all I am saying.

Also, "playing" nice now is essentially what the "western" world has done in the form of appeasement, and look how that turned out in the late 30s and 40s.

Yes, Iran and North Korea didn’t attack us because of Trump. Has nothing to do with the fact that they have a literal zero chance of winning any conflict against us and would get blown into oblivion regardless. 

It was because of Trump and not at all due to our FAR superior military might and their complete and total inability to function with their aging Cold War era weapons.

Yeah, this ticker has been around on the pennystocks sub for ages, and I still haven't found anyone who can tell me where BNGO's revenue growth, much less scalable profits will come from. They sell the machines to labs that already mostly have them.

The tech is great, the monetization not so much. 

Full disclosure: I have been in and out of BNGO several times in the last year (including a month ago, angry that I missed out on this wild runup), and it usually bounces between .50 and $1. Expect it to drop back into that range, if not soon, then certainly after the next earnings report.

Last quarter: Revenue 2.2M, down 33% YOY, Profit -$10M, Margin -491%
I feel like since then most stocks have been moving in the same pattern.. like almost identical it looks manipulated

Lots of articles citing stock market bubble as P/E ratio reach level that is only surpassed by the doc com bubble, second highest ever.

But Isn’t it true that the current P/E is high due to covid-19 and in fact many companies in entire industries are reporting loss per share, such as travel, airline...etc. So isn’t it flawed to use the current P/E as assessment of market valuation. Is the P/E, specifically calculated with forward earning post covid timeframe, showing the same sky high valuation? 

Also, what about stock valuation vs fixed income? The reality is that the days of 6% fixed bonds is long gone, so while 15x multiple might be the norm in the past, when factoring in the the virtually 0% return, what is the new norm?
Holy fuck. Is this the longest DD to ever grace this sub?

No worries, I love this stuff! I would actually say roughly 538 roughly since was the point because that was the resistance it broke through to start its push to 565.

Also if your time horizon is pretty long (months) the chart looks pretty bullish from a daily perspective and looks like it’s still in a solid uptrend.

2 for every 9 shares you own. They are redeemable at $23 per share. So it's sort of a built-in long call that you get for free. If you hate the target acquisition you can cash them out at $23. Or you can sit on them if you're bullish long term.

Also they don't give partial warrants so make sure you own an amount of shares divisible by 9

Korean. Popeyes is a guilty pleasure, but Korean place here makes some bomb fried wings and their house sauce gets my jimmies rustled
I don’t disagree, 
but part of the ease is also not having to be stuck to the market all day if you choose not to and still make money.

I think if you write enough options you actually pick up a solid edge when it comes to buying them which would re-Inforce the buy side idea
Up good for now. Tomorrow’s a new day

No, this is great. I’ve decided to actually learn how to read charts instead of just buying meme options, so this is very helpful. I’ve noticed that there are many factors beyond simple changes in stock price that impact spikes in option pricing and that’s where I’m focusing my attention right now.

I stumbled across this thread at just the right time, as it’s helped me find some additional resources.

I also may blindly follow your yolo call as a thank you for this.

It’s not done spiking though, however I agree
It appears trending into oversold on the 2 & 4 hour charts, but looks to still have a long way it could slide on the daily chart; however, those premiums look delish.

Not dumb. In short spikeability. a sweet spot where the stock price can rise and create a spike in the option contract. I want the contract to be spikeable and on the low end of it spiking. Has a lot to do with Delta / Gamma and IV. Sometimes it is quicker for me to visualize a graph. I don't want to be to far OTM or close to ITM.  

You can backtest on the link I provided where the best times to buy and sell that contract was in the past, matching the dates and times up with a chart. And look for a similar pattern in the future. Scroll your curser over the graph and check a $NOW chart.  

There is more. Youtube delta, gamma, intrinsic value, extrinsic value and IV implied volitility.  

I probably sucked at explaining how this works for me. People here can probably better explain.
Bears, you are actually fucked this month you know this right? Like I’m not even kidding it sounds really stupid to me when you guys talk like you believe otherwise.

The USA is the biggest aggressor in this whole equation. I am not a CCP apologist, I think they are a terrible government and I have many criticisms of them.  

But way too many people are falling for the classic American anti communist rhetoric that has been shaping our perceptions of the world since ww1 only to become more and more prevalent with every major conflict.

Been trading and working strictly pharma/robotics/med tech for a decade now. I may write up my top movers and shakers this week for 2021. Or expected as my opinion, then see how close I am.

I have an irrational fear of losing a lot of people money so I will be cautious. I wanna bring some real autistically written DD back to this sub. Might be limited cause the 1 billy rule
A dip is only a dip if it only lasts a day (the shorter the better because you want stocks that get bought up quickly from any pullback) and doesn’t dip below the point where it began the new uptrend. 

With NOW, that’s not a dip, it’s a straight up trend reversal (or at least a trend exhaustion).

I don't disagree that investing in US operators is important to capitalize on what i agree is a once in a lifetime opportunity. I do disagree that you should disregard Aphria, Tilray, CGC or even Cronos. 

Tilray/Aphria will be the largest international cannabis company that already has access to US markets through their own acquisitions. 

CGC also will have access and is already selling CBD products in the US. They also have Martha fucking Stewart. 

Cronos has Altria's infrastructure and US operations to tap into. 

They're all long term holds.

QS overdue for a moonshot? big consolidation. big nuts. fuck the haters. who cares if it's not a real product yet. you retards will gladly buy more Dickola so i dont even trust any of your DD
explain this more. If i buy a call... market makers have to be shares?
I have. It limits banks from buying risky or certain short term assets. I was not aware it disallowed them from selling other assets and then purchasing back their own stonk. 

Are you sure it blocks them from doing so?
Lmaoo the username checks out too
Lmao.

The irony of calling out my immaturity whilst calling for the culling of Muslims.
How low do people actually think spy will go this week? I can't believe it's actually profitable to buy a 352/351 call spread! No matter who wins this election the world is not going to end

I was qualified for the job at the time. According to my email history, I replied once and they wanted to talk to me, but I didn't follow up. Probably would be worth $10M+ if I landed this job.

Sold the att call at close on Thursday
I don't disagree but I'd put those first two seasons up against anything.

Edit: Plus, SCDP gave us lines like, "I don't think about you at all."
Well yes, it is TSLA, so it could go to $600 or $850 by the end of the week. But I would not bet on that. Got to wait closer to earnings. But we shall see. My guess is it goes sideways slowly bleeding towards $715. Maybe I should do an IC. 🤔

Sold. On never selling now. Thabks captain. Now i think i lost my gills ill go find them.
If it breaks 565 then the uptrend will continue. Until then, there’s no trade.

Notice everytime it got near there, the selling pressure  pushed it back down. If it overcomes this, then 🚀

Yes, that thing that only goes up. I am not debating that increases in taxes jeopardize corp profits holding everything else constant. My argument is the likelihood and timeline of when material tax increases could come into play. But when they do raise corp tax rates, again I do not believe that will be within two years, what will likely happen is corps will try to pass the buck onto the consumer in order to maintain profits as much as possible. Aka that sparkly rainbow butt plug you've been eyeing will cost you a little more - start rolling your pennies.

Explain to me how you can infer anything about sentiment if you don't include whether these were bought at the bid or the ask. Every time somebody buys a call someone else sells one, so  without knowing whether the buyer or seller was more motivated how does this tell you anything?

If you think the trend is up. Wait for it to go above the resistance that caused it to go down to confirm your opinion. For reference, look at 30 minute chart on the day in November when TSLA went above its 465 resistance. The second it broke this, it was an entry and that’s when professional traders went in (then came retail) and the price hasn’t stopped going up.
Yeah you can borrow it for one Tesla share per day

Dem win is a pro because the certainty that the presidential election is 100% decided and over, and that there will be more stimulus. If the republicans win it’ll be a pro because it’ll prevent any major regulatory changes getting through.
I bought the dip. Didn't paper hand. I'm kinda proud right now. Hopefully this won't come back to bite me in the ass.
That's true. If all of WSB bought PLTR 50c the market makers would be forced to buy so many shares to hedge we'd be printing

Even if this wasn't the case, Dems have historically been way more dovish than Republicans when it comes to interest rates. Arguing that a Dem win will lead to higher interest rates is just fucking stupid. Maybe OP should go take that finance class he recommends.

How about if a sub billion company has legitimate news pending or there is a reasonable belief it is going to move above 1 Billion soon then it can be talked about

So all under 1 billion ban, if someone makes a legit post with maybe a like or comment threshold

Then keep that ticker and put it ur filter list or whatever
Do you curate this db yourself?

he's probably been out. just pumps for the chumps.
Proof that Vanguard didn’t just buy it for Total Stock Market because it’s a stock...

Solid pump and dump post 💯
Honestly just a gut feeling, which is usually wrong. Don't take my advice, I blew my $35k portfolios on CALLS last year during the bull market in nov / dec
You think its too late to get in? I panic sold and made 50 profit missed out 1k profit today lmao
Literally loling
hella nice name
Unless what?! Wsb has more rockets 🚀 than anybody else in the world
Ehh calls that are more than 1 month out are pretty safe imo especially if you buy on a big down day to get that discount before the bounce

Yeah you can make this idea more complicated if you want, just don’t want to make zjz do a bunch of work
Long shot but if Dems win Senate tomorrow wont markets tank based on more regulation?  Trying to make a plan for trades tomorrow.
They disappeared Jack fuckin Ma off to re-education camp, and you guys think these chinese stocks are safe lol
Why do you think that? That all sub $5 stocks will moon, I mean. Is there a reason?
Selling cash secured puts on it is the play IMO.

If your asking, I think I'd prefer to see the actual tickers rather than the bees mushrooms and waterlemons.  I say this on the outside looking in and so I'm not aware of what is actually being filtered.  Seems like there's no simple clear-cut answer without needing some poor sap to sacrafice a lot of time and energy.  Wouldn't be so bad, if it ended up working.  It reminds me of building lego towers with toddlers, where the co-ordinated skill and effort will be destroyed by a drooling psychopath.
What makes this perfect is that it overlooks Europe and not the US.
Hope this means I’m not fucked on my NIO calls that expire Friday
[deleted]
You guys ever get to the point where you're down so much it's just laughable? Literally me right now with my 1/15 240 BABA calls. HK ain't doing so hot rn and just because my life sucks ass I guarantee it keeps going down tomorrow. So buy puts and make money because I'm riding these out.
No the stock just tanked like 25% the week after I stopped wheeling it lmao.

Tired of praying. Just fly BA.

No but assuming it will go back up. It possibly could be some risk off. By the amount of institutional hedging going on. It's a distinct possibility.

Just checking in to make sure you guys bought the dip today
90-100%
Me too. Last resistance was 259 in October. Not to mention they just inked a deal with Walmart to handle all their returns. Once it finds a bottom it will march back to 300
I don't think so, these guys don't even have sales yet nor a product to even sell. It'll be interesting to see how it settles.
I saw on [TIKR](https://app.tikr.com/stock/ownership?st=shareholders&cid=104422749&tid=685219094) that 77% of outstanding shares are owned by one institution, EagleTree Capital. Is that massive ownership by one fund weird? Genuinely asking... I'm looking for an excuse to get into CRSR and don't *actually* know what I'm doing.
At least you are honest about it, unlike that retard dj kaled:”All I do is win...” lol

To expand on this, you can just use an EMA of the market cap to update the 8K ticker database daily (or whatever interval). 

α = 0.95

M^(avg) = M^(avg) * α + M^(sample) * (1 - α)

It's been good over the years, this recent run up isn't the same action it's been doing since trading it from 2017. Almost always a 4 to 5 dollar range and drops back down. I'm skeptical of it at the moment.

They created a faboo world and filled it with great characters and kind of lost the story that connected them.

Hey
“From 1926 to 2019, we have had a Republican president for 46 years, and a Democratic president for 48 years. The difference in returns between the parties is pretty stark. The average annual return for the S&P 500 index when we had a Republican President was 9.12%. When we had a Democratic President, the S&P 500 average 14.94% per year. That’s a premium of a little more than 5.8% per year on average.”

I'm always the highest or lowest of my day at open. Often think dang I wish I would have sold this morning. Although whenever there is a huge morning dip I know it will trickle up the rest of the day. I have thought of using a strategy like you proposed. I don't think you could simply sell and buy everyday. You'd probably want 10 or so really researched stocks and wait for dips to buy and sell on the pops. It would require patience and following the your rules. Could probably work.
Yup I hope he's just joking or else I just feel sorry for that mentality
This is the first one I made, so I’ll keep that in mind for my next one
Yes I hope most people know that. I said I “could” have bought one.It’s important to think of your balance of actual things you can buy with it so that you don’t just see numbers on your screen

Thanks! If you are looking another stock may want to look into V B I V and their eVLP platform, been adding shares on every dip. Also i started looking into T R X C.
It's kind of like options without the Greeks or expirations and strikes. So it's nothing like options.

It really will. I don’t hold it but I see where it’s going. 1500 EOY
Which I think is it's greatest strength.  The Wire is showing how there really is no central character in life.  Mcnulty and the other cops have to interact with the brass and the criminals.  The brass are interconnected to the politicians who are criminals on another level.  The criminals are interconnected to everyone but nobody really acknowledges it except the criminals.  The central character is, if anything, the city of Baltimore, not an individual.

Internet guy to internet guy, yes he plans to increase taxes, mainly from corp and the rich - so you don't have to worry. In fact, you'll prob get a tax break and be able to double your RH account with a $400 yolo on HTZ with the tax refund. BUT the focus will likely be stimmy and recovery before they hammer taxes, I'd be surprised if there's a material market moving tax increase within two years. And you do realize that their platform needs to take stances on various aspects such as taxes, economy, healthcare, education,  gov investment, climate change, etc... But these are not all equal, taxes will slide down the list until we are more stable and then Sleepy Joe will try to collect. Yes, increasing taxes are in his platform but, IMIGO (in my internet guy opinion), it is not going to cripple stonks in the very near future like you are suggesting.

something strange with their calls, bought 53 OTM , now ITM but profit is about 1.66% , WTF!?
\* wipes Cheeto dust off sweatshirt\* why?
Was thinking about picking up some puts but it popped above resistance with decent strength lol still waiting for an entry signal.
Reason beyond being one of the poors that I am not in on GME:

Read something the other day on WSB about the short sellers trying to back door a deal with GME to buy shares NOT ON THE MARKET to cover their shorts. Paying GME a premium but NOT paying full market INFINITE SQUEEZZZZEEEE!!!!! value. And I can damn well believe that MM's will do that shit. 

TLDR: Private, MM Only GME shares printer go BBBBRRRRRRRR!!!
So they can't be fooled by a (bull) trap queen
Yes that is one of the best parts of this feedback loop- they sell shares then use that money to buy shares of these companies. It’s leverage on leverage. In the 1920’s there was a huge bubble caused by holding companies that bought shares of other holding companies that were just buying stock in normal companies. It was a major cause of the ensuing crash and were in many ways basically the same thing ARK and other active managers are doing now.
Just buy the dips and sell the rips on JNUG the next month.

If the people failing to deliver are simply holding on to their assets instead of delivering them, they were not naked short selling they are maybe more like “hey sorry here’s your money back.... so do you still want to buy the shares now that they are $x?” And that might explain the higher pricing efficiency

I think you should be less stringent on the tickers you ban and allow for more variety. Lessen the market cap because there are a lot of good and interesting companies that are getting left behind because of these very strict restrictions you have in place.

What in the fuck is that subreddit lmao, all the undateables putting a ring on themselves 🤣🤣🤣
It got a little overheated and corrected back to where it was a week ago. It's fine. Should start climbing again soon.
srsly tho, so if the stock teeter-totters back and forth on a daily basis, does that mean we can talk about it one day and not the next and then we can talk about it again the day after? i think once it hits 1b just let it chill

or a monthly revaluation, not daily

The alternative is letting them layoff less. Let 'em layoff, they'll either continue to exist because they're too big to fail like Google or Apple, or they'll die off as businesses that don't fill an economic niche should.

I think weekly is the best compromise. The only other thing I'd suggest is maybe making it asymmetrical, so that once a ticker goes above 1b, it's good for a month. When it falls below, it gets re-evaluated every week.

I also like the idea of the weekly post with the changes.

Is there any way to use market cap in combination of what the liquidity is like? If a low market cap comes into something deemed high enough for WSB but is severely illiquid its still bannable?

What I'm trying to get at is seeing whether or not the stock is "well known" enough to trade. If a random stock is getting pumped and is not really relevant to anything going on it may be a pump and dump. Just not sure how to measure that.

Like when seeing a Leonardo DiCaprio in a movie, you'll be like "he's Jack" "he's the crazy batshit who fraud with penny stocks in wall street" but you won't have that strong of a feeling of "oh he's Leonardo DiCaprio".

Have a “gray area” where a ticker doesn’t change, say from $0.75b to $1.25b. If you are a banned ticker, you don’t get greenlit until $1.25b. Once you get greenlit, you have some wiggle room until you fall back into banned territory (back down to $0.75b). Feel free to adjust the gap around $1b as you see fit
what happened?
Glad I stopped selling PLTR options when I did, dodged a bullet there. I either got lucky or I was the guy propping up the stock. I'd like to think it could be 50/50 either way.
What happened to the requirement to deliver after 13 days of being on the list? Could it be different groups who are activating the threshold separately for a failure to deliver and it just appears as if it is one continuous failure?

Just sorta trying to figure it out and rule everything else out before assuming foul play
It seemed like that didn't it?

There is one main difference I can see though. In September we had been on an ungodly moonshot all through August and it ended up with insane buying the last few days of the run with AAPL hitting a very brief high of $137. Everything had been insanely overbought for days or even weeks.

This is a little different imo. We have had a bumpy path with some days of selling and pullbacks. Some stuff is quite overbought, but there are also sectors that have been selling and many stocks sold off hard EOM December.
Orwell was staunchly anti-Stalin and anti-fascist (anti-totalitarianist), and that was the reason he fought in the Spanish civil war of 1936. He didn't see the full extent of Stalin's regime, but he didn't like much of what he did see and his experiences in the 30s and 40s directly led to his writing of Animal Farm and 1984.  


Some random quote I found from a book:  
"Orwell’s personal experiences fighting against Franco in the Spanish Civil War planted the seeds for his anti-Fascist/Totalitarian political view. Orwell fought against Franco’s regime under a non-Stalin left wing militia called the Workers’ Party of Marxist Unification. He originally planned to fight exclusively against Fascism, but pro-Stalin forces branded his party as traitors. This led to the state charging Orwell with treason which prompted him to flee the country along with his wife. This conviction also revealed to him his true enemy, not Fascism or Communism, but Totalitarianism. Many readers of the novel fail to realize this and simply understand it as a warning against Fascism."
The problem with the wire is there isn’t a driving main character throughout the series. Mcnulty I guess? The sopranos and breaking bad have driving central characters giving a career defining performance that really adds to the impact that the wire lacks.

normal market fluctuations. a 1-2% red day is not a bad thing, that isn't bearish all of a sudden. people react so fast and ultimately lose money. the market has red days, people sell for tax purposes, its not some black dove or whatever and gonna be the next big 10% crash or move.

I used this a lot during the downturn when we were having pretty reliable red day green day red day patterns, but the markets since the downturn have really been a little unpredictable for me to do that lately. Still relying on day trades or 3-4 day swings. Seems like buying calls at the end of any red day is reasonably safe lately, though.

Yes they will. Polling has consistently underestimated Republican voters and if I had to pick a side, I would go with 2 R victories or 1 and 1. Either way, they keep the Senate.

I made my plays today accordingly. Still a chance Dems pull this off, but I went with the odds on this one.
This is great

I mean.... I did figure out the right day. I just wasn’t sure what constituted a “business day” since the market isn’t really a business.

buying more fdx and coty. fdx at these levels are absurd, down almost 20% in less than a month after a blowout earnings. IV has came in, options are dirt cheap and next quarter will be there best ever. more lockdowns just means more shipping. also look at next quarter eps guestimates, they are VERY low, this will be a blowout for them.

Dollar for dollar it’s pretty close. I agreed with your original comment that trump spent more but the way you compared the two was incorrect. But, looking into it, estimating how much a president added to a deficit is actually more difficult than one would expect

Like i and many of us said, rules of WSB didnt let us post about this stock bc market cap was under 1B and post was immediately deleted. But if you do your own DD and believe in the company and what it has going for it, 6 anything under 10 i believe is still a great entry.
doubt it, it was just booking profits in the mega caps to start the year, and cool off all the RSI's. very little risk from here

🥩 & 🥦 pro-tip: Add baking soda and msg to your marinade
BA and BABA (BA\^2) are two of the most undervalued plays out there right now. I feel there is some sort of conspiracy going on...
ACB back in AH like a rocket to close at daily high. No big deal. 

**$15 by end of week.**
Generally they purchase the same product with one supplier providing most and the other more of a backup but it’s the same product and I believe in their pricing models they account for fluctuation in the price. Sometimes they get burned a bit sometimes they reap the benefits

In September we were about to gap up and touch $360 but as soon as we touched $358, we started dumping and we didn't get there again until November. The way we touched $375 and dumped today reminds me of that.

STOP TALKING ABOUT RULE 4 OR YOU WILL BE BANNED!
Yes he ran on a rather moderate platform compared to Bernie sanders or Elizabeth warren and I don’t know how up with the times you are, but he’s appointing corporate approved nominees, like Janet Yellen, to his cabinet. On most fiscal issues Biden has been similar to a 90s republican while the primary pushed him to the left some, sadly I doubt much of that influence will persist. 

How do you live in the US are you aware that Joe Biden spent most of his career as the senator for Delaware? Do you know how corporate friendly you had to be to be a senator in Delaware?

Again corporate tax rate increases might be in the future, but I highly doubt they will occur until long after the pandemic. In the meantime Americans will get further stimulus which most economists agree will help the economy (and in turn the market)

You probably missing the fat. Here is what you do. Get some beef shank. Cut it into inch chunks. Boil it for 1 minute. Rinse the meat of impurities. Buy an instant pot. Hit the saute button. Smash some garlic. 2 tbps oil. Saute garlic briefly. Put in the beef. Saute until slightly browned. Cover beef with beef stock, 90pct. Pressure cook on high for about 30 min. Then natural release for 20 min. Then drop in your top ramen. You gravy baby
Great price right now

Intel does have a FPGA division, previously Altera. They have some good stuff going on there. But they really really need to evolve beyond the x86. RISC-V could be a neat pivot, but would require lots of software retooling from their customers. ARM would mean paying royalties to use it... 

Without any indicators of Intel changing strategies at the pace the market is changing... shorting could work.

I am not put off by today's stock price drop as the fundamentals of Romeo have improved compared to yesterday and the cheaper stock is a good buying opportunity for anyone who wants to get in below $20 per share. DD below. 

Today's price drop was driven by a conflation of macro economic factors unrelated to Romeo, namely: 

1. There was a broad market sell off today. 80% of S&P 500 companies lost value. This was due to more restrictive COVID restrictions in North America and Europe. 

2. On negative market news (above), investors take their money out of riskier stocks first, less risky stocks last. Romeo is a riskier stock because its a relatively new company (founded in 2016) and a small company (less than $1bn market cap), so naturally more investors will flee Romeo versus say, Apple or Tesla. 

3. The EV sector (and SPACs generally) exploded in q4 2020. It's natural for air to come out of a balloon that's been inflated so dramatically and rapidly as investors will be taking their profits. 

4. A report came out today casting doubt on the promise of QuantumScape's solid state technology. This caused QS stock to drop dramatically. Since QS is the poster child of the EV/SPAC bubble, short term investors get scared off of the sector as a whole and flee other EV stocks (not just QS). 

5. The conflation of factors above results in significant selling pressure, causing the stock price to dip significantly. After this initial (2%) price fall, day traders who are overleveraged face margin calls and are forced to sell. This causes the price to drop even more dramatically. This price drop - margin call pattern is a self reinforcing cycle which results in a large price drop on the day.

Despite the above, I am confident Romeo Power is currently undervalued at $20 per share, because:

6. Romeo is one of the only EV sector players with a product - and it even has revenue already. Prior to today the company had over $500 million in committed revenue (2021 to 2025). 

7. Today Romeo signed a supply contract with Heritage Power, which is additional committed revenue on top of the $500 million.

8. Today Amazon agreed to purchase from Lion Power up to 2,500 electric busses. Romeo is the battery supplier for Lion Power, so this Amazon deal de-risks the committed revenue Romeo has from Lion Power. Lion Power has also found a SPAC partner which will provide the necessary funding to manufacture the busses.

9. Even better, Amazon's contract with Lion Power includes an option for Amazon to purchase up to a 20 per cent stake in Lion Power. If Amazon exercises this option, Lion Power will be a force to be reckoned with in the electric Class 8 commercial vehicle market - in which Romeo is the market leader - which bodes incredibly well for Romeo long term.

Therefore, I am not put off by today's stock price drop as the fundamentals of Romeo have improved compared to yesterday and the cheaper stock is a good buying opportunity for anyone who wants to get in below $20 per share. BTIG analysts have set a price target of $40 for Romeo (not factoring in the latest positive developments set out above).

To be clear, I don’t hear the Democrats talking about raising the corporate tax rate right now. I think we should hold steady until we’re past the pandemic but getting rid of the trump income tax cuts for the rich would be something we can and should do now
I mean you've learned to stop posting your account number online so.. baby steps.

Absolutely, you've still got a lot of upside, ICR conference next monday, initially holiday sales data release which insiders are "very happy with".

Things were expected to head sideways this week, I wasn't expecting such big loses, but in the shares history we've had swings like this before.

You have the opportunity now to average down if you want to take it, if not, you'll have a tidy profit on your shares if you still plan to hold them in the medium term, let this run until Q4 results in march seems to be the sensible play.

All good. It’s not a stock. It’s a SPAC that is in the process of identifying an acquisition target.

So there’s a company called $SKLZ that apparently ark bought today and as a result it’s up 10% after hours. So now the mere fact that they bought a stock is alone vindication of the bull thesis on any stock as if the company just announced a huge earnings beat or new product line. This ark to stock feedback loop bubble is so fucking obvious I can’t wait for it to blow up so I can short it to the earth’s core.

Most COVID deaths are attributed to diabetes, high BMI, cardio issues and other health concerns that I guess you look over because you are soft and a people person per your words.

Do you care that America is full of fat people who spend billions on fat loss products but still gorge on shitty food? 

Get over yourself. More people have OD’d in San Francisco than died of COVID but I guess you aren’t focused on that.

Uugh the trend is your friend, should have waited for a shift but I do wish you luck

Should be a good bounce play if you are able to time it correctly
1. There was a broad market sell off today. 80% of S&P 500 companies lost value. This was due to more restrictive COVID restrictions in North America and Europe. 

2. On negative market news (above), investors take their money out of riskier stocks first, less risky stocks last. Romeo is a riskier stock because its a relatively new company (founded in 2016) and a small company (less than $1bn market cap), so naturally more investors will flee Romeo versus say, Apple or Tesla. 

3. The EV sector (and SPACs generally) exploded in q4 2020. It's natural for air to come out of a balloon that's been inflated so dramatically and rapidly as investors will be taking their profits. 

4. A report came out today casting doubt on the promise of QuantumScape's solid state technology. This caused QS stock to drop dramatically. Since QS is the poster child of the EV/SPAC bubble, short term investors get scared off of the sector as a whole and flee other EV stocks (not just QS). 

5. The conflation of factors above results in significant selling pressure, causing the stock price to dip significantly. After this initial (2%) price fall, day traders who are overleveraged face margin calls and are forced to sell. This causes the price to drop even more dramatically. This price drop - margin call pattern is a self reinforcing cycle which results in a large price drop on the day.

Despite the above, I am confident Romeo Power is currently undervalued at $20 per share, because:

6. Romeo is one of the only EV sector players with a product - and it even has revenue already. Prior to today the company had over $500 million in committed revenue (2021 to 2025). 

7. Today Romeo signed a supply contract with Heritage Power, which is additional committed revenue on top of the $500 million.

8. Today Amazon agreed to purchase from Lion Power up to 2,500 electric busses. Romeo is the battery supplier for Lion Power, so this Amazon deal de-risks the committed revenue Romeo has from Lion Power. Lion Power has also found a SPAC partner which will provide the necessary funding to manufacture the busses.

9. Even better, Amazon's contract with Lion Power includes an option for Amazon to purchase up to a 20 per cent stake in Lion Power. If Amazon exercises this option, Lion Power will be a force to be reckoned with in the electric Class 8 commercial vehicle market - in which Romeo is the market leader - which bodes incredibly well for Romeo long term.

I am not put off by today's stock price drop as the fundamentals of Romeo have improved compared to yesterday and the cheaper stock is a good buying opportunity for anyone who wants to get in below $20 per share. BTIG analysts have set a price target of $40 for Romeo (not factoring in the latest positive developments set out above).

Funny how the GOP likes to talk out their ass about supporting small businesses and the middle class yet small businesses are in ruins, tax breaks were given churches and corporations, and stimmybwas denied to all Americans. You're fucking retarded if you think stock market reflects economy and you're even more retarded if you think the economy was great bc of the trump admin

⚠️ This claim is disputed.
Historically you’re right but this is just because dems tend to prefer employment instead of inflations. Let me explain. Under republican administrations, inflations was on average lower but growth also a bit lower. But in real terms, growth was higher with republican government.

We completely agree there. Demographically the republican party is doomed.

My entire point is that trump supporters (repubs) most likely won’t change their vote over his call, and in the short term like tomorrow that could be a problem
national debt grew by 8 Tn under Trump, more than under dems. GOP claims to be for small budgets but thats just bs.

Not many chances for EV battery company like Microvast coming through SPAC. Worth the risk/reward for me so rolling the dice.

You see lives as a number. I see it as people. You have low morals as long as you hold that view. Its fine if you see it this way since majority of politicians have the same viewpoint as you. Its stupid to sugarcoat it and say you’re a “realist”. 

And secondly what does obesity have to do with any of this?
I am holding BNGO not because I believe in the rumour that ARKG will buy it. I truly believe 2021 and beyond will be a great year for genomics (already was in 2020) because sometimes the first few industry leaders fall behind like Nokia, Sony in the 1990s. The first industry leaders deliver the idea and vision. While other companies improvise and introduce innovation by releasing new products. Even though Bionano is only manufacturing hardwares for genome mapping, I believe they have a chance of scaling up if they can work for clients such as Edit and Crispr therapeutics
No, what I’m saying is Chewy is not a subscription service. You can just set up an autoship for certain products you regularly buy, like food, if you want.

What’s with this Tesla pump during AH lmao
I think you never took a finance course. Net present value of stocks is made using **real** rates. Since the real interest rate is just the nominal interest rate (set by the fed) -inflation, as long as the Fed keeps hiking interest rates to match inflation, real rates don’t move ! So the valuation of stocks doesn’t change.
This should be used in a criminal court against the banksters.

Apple executives should say something publicly about this or else be similarly charged.

I'm confused. Taking proportionally more money from people who have more than enough seems to make sense to me. As long as that tax money is used on infrastructure and science and not big defense penises. Which I guess is another matter.

In my opinion, it was a tactical error. In some of the earlier interviews of Alex Karp, it was briefly discussed that they envisaged company as engineers only. There has been several companies that have grown organically that way. However it takes long time. 2nd they also wanted exceptional product and set right expectations. The problem they had in hand was bigger and once they got comfortable, it was clear that they need focused marketing and sales effort to grow at pace, they are looking.

It was mix of tactical and strategic choices which worked both ways.

Microsoft opens shop across from Intel Hillsboro offices.. to build their own CPU.

https://www.bizjournals.com/portland/news/2020/12/31/microsoft-corp-lease-85-000-square-feet-hillsboro.html

≠============

Microsoft Corp. has signed a lease for the Ambercreek building in Hillsboro, according to a person familiar with the deal, marking the latest development in the tech giant's long hunt for space in the Portland metro.

The Redmond, Washington-based company’s lease covers 85,000 square feet at 9800 NE Gibbs Drive. Marketing materials for Ambercreek highlight its access to Highway 26 and the outdoors. The building was on the market for quite some time, the source said.

Microsoft (Nasdaq: MSFT) had been searching for space in the Portland area for its cloud division since before the pandemic, the Business Journal reported in July. While it's unclear what Microsoft plans to pay for rent, Ambercreek's pricing has been marketed at $22 per square foot.

≠===============
Top 1% owns majority of stocks in market, Top 1% pays less % in taxes then normal people. Top 1% throws retarded fit when threatened with blue sweep.

But raising taxes is sock of marbles GOP loves beating Dems over head with.  No way they do it unless they can get some GOP votes imo.  Raising taxes is not something they are going to be eager to do with what with how well GOP did this cycle outside POTUS.  Plus its at best 50/50 Dems even win senate at this point.
TSLA going to be some perceived kind of safe haven should democrats win, whereby its big-business but also green/EV business so will be favoured so much as is possible. Presumably that is why it ran today while evil non-green brothers fell by the wayside

While I do agree intel is going to be outperformed and fall victim to creative destruction, shorting them is a bad idea imo. They’re still a huge well known tech company that sells a lot of products and their fall will be slow and drawn out over many years, don’t think it’s one you can make any exciting gains on and your puts will just bleed theta trying to time a drop that probably won’t happen apart from over years as a timeframe. Like it’s just gonna be a stock that slowly losses 5% or so a year IMO anyway

You really can’t blame them. The market is fucking ruthless if a company isn’t constantly crushing expectations.

The whole goal on riding the train to tendieville is finding companies with a ever deminishing separation between their costs to their returns.

PLTR is closing their gap in the red is expected to start printing green by 1) the innovative tech and industrial value they present 2) their recent IPO being significant step for the company as a real contender 3) their increase in gross revenue. You can tell that they are aggressive with their product considering how much resources they are putting into universal sale strategies. Company is currently spending upwards of 50 as of recent because Karp has some magical shit he’s on. He firmly believes that PLTR is ready for aggressive expansion 

Right now it’s a meme stock, but the bull case is real my guy.

I am seriously into politics and predicted Trump win in 16 even though I despise him. I predicted GA would go Biden (I bet on it and won bigly) and I'll even tell you the margins: Ossoff by  +.85 to +1.6. Warnock by +1.75 to +2.5

Yeah man I don’t know how long the green ride lasts but my thought on it is that for the past 4 years it’s been pretty suppressed due to Trump administration lax economic policies.

If Biden offers incentives for solar and tax rebates and stuff, we could see a huge run up.

I’m in 2x tan 1/21/22 110c and 100 icln shares bought right after the election. Had icln and tan July calls which I stupidly sold thinking they’d pull back sometime, and shit just don’t seem to be stopping right now.

I think it’s got a lot of potential positive news, senate runoff results, Biden economic and environmental plans, stuff like that. 

I wouldn’t go all in just in case, but I’d definitely take a position in them. Good luck man!
yeah idk why people are expecting another march

Citron not shorting QS is criminal
Lol you’re an idiot. What’s the rich? Top 1% that would be 3.3 million people. Let’s say it’s top 3% that makes it 10 million. 

The US smartphone market is 275 million smartphones (https://www.statista.com/topics/2711/us-smartphone-market/)

Do you think the smartphone industry (apple, Samsung, etc.) in the US is propped up by the top 3% buying 27.5 phones each? 

The rich hold a disproportionate amount of stock, but it isn’t their purchases that are supporting the economy. Chipotle is 300% of what it was two years ago, do you think that’s based on the rich eating chipotle every night or is it based on the middle and working class eating there?

You’re right that working and middle class are struggling to pay rent, that’s why fiscal stimulus for them (which Dems support) will be so useful in allowing them to get over this hurdle and to help them put more of their money into our CONSUMER economy. 

Lol just lol if you think these big companies could thrive based on just the rich buying their products. Ultimately the middle class buy a majority of the non-luxury goods and that helps earnings and then the rich buy the underlying stocks. 

As for Tesla, you clearly don’t understand the valuation (and I own Tesla stock). Their sales don’t justify the stock price. The stock price is based on a belief that they’ll win in autonomous driving and then be able to replace Uber/Lyft driving the masses around. That’s the addressable market which is lucrative, not selling a few hundred thousand cars with small margins.

Since when higher corporate taxes are good for the economy? Dems are indeed good for the stockmarket during first years, because they are usually inflationary with all the deficit spending. But in a long run they usually hurt the middle class and moderate rich, while super rich and extremely poor do better.

You guys know how to read?
The market is propped up by the government. If you’re a zombie company and no one will touch your trash bonds the Fed will buy them up. The market has been hanging on stimulus bills all year. All major rallies since the Nixon era have been fueled by government set interest rates.

How can you say the market should not advocate government policy. The government is the market at this point. 

Is it a good system? No. Is is actively hurting our collective well being? Yes. Will this all end in disaster? Almost certainly.

But when the music is playing you have to dance, so grab as much profit as you can.

No one disagrees with you on that. The point is that companies like Tesla are so shady that they used accounting tricks and regulatory credits to show a profit. Companies nowadays are doing a lot of fuckery compared to the days when MSFT or amzn were not profitable.

This! Intel lost the laptop/desktop/server, mobile, and accelerator/gpu market. They limp along on legacy customers, but they're basically a zombie at this point. I'd go for longer dated puts tho. There are currently some deep pocketed bagholders trying to pump this so they can get out.

Look at the balance sheets before they became profitable

Amazon had issues for years trying to secure VC funding 

Apple was propped by Microsoft cash for years to keep in accordance with Antitrusts

Tesla hemorrhaged cash for 7-8 years before their first profitable quarter shot their stock price from 170 to 650 for years they were losing revenue on each car sale. It was in the red and occurring debt
Shares for low risk. IF the market turns red in first quarter still WKHS can be 100 by the end of the year. Stock is safe bet.

They are beyond irrelevant, actually more like dis-information. Better to just ignore them to be honest. Pre-market has a purpose but futures, you may as well look at your tea leaves to help you guess what the market is actually going to do in the daily session.
This is very helpful. Thank you!

1) Company X has 100 outstanding shares  
2) Long #1 owns all 100 shares and lends them to a short  
3) Short borrows those 100 shares and sells them to a long #2  
4) All 3 are now holding positions. 2 long positions = 200 shares. 1 short position = 100 shares. Those 100 outstanding shares are now 300 shares.  
5) Stock market fughazi fugheezi. Repeat ad infinitum.

don't fuckin go cold turkey. We are here bcos we have gambling in our blood, if you stop for a few days you will come back suddenly one day and Yolo it into something stupid guaranteed. Instead keep a small amt in, just enough to get the fix and switch to shares of some of the meme ETFs/ tickers you see mentioned here and just do buy and hold. For example, Just the ARK ETFs and TAN/ICLN/QCLN/XLE is fine. Then just hold and chill and watch
If dems win why stop at 2k checks? Go for a bigger stimmy. 10k checks. Imagine the pump on spy

It’s a joke. The fact is that this is going to cause a greater rift and a transition of many areas from Blue to Red due to the visible and apparent hypocrisy from the liberal leaders.  

I think there will be an awakening soon in many of these liberal states and it will snap back come 2022. 

Every time someone says “Democrats would have handled it differently” I ask then what have Democrats handled well? NY and California are prime examples of idiots being voted in by idiots and it’s not the best example.
I wouldn't complain if funds transitioned to some sort of semi-transparent style, releasing their holdings every quarter rather than in real-time.
From the bird feeder!
 Rs always turn out in huge numbers to vote. Dems underachieve in these kinds of votes.

So even if part of the R base is anti trump or pro trump and anti gop, itll be a lot

Hopefully you took profits this morning on your short dated calls. If you didn’t, you’re a retard.

If the SA variant proves vaxx resistant and we dump, be prepared to back up the truck. There’s typically a 4-6 week lead time on vaxx mods and any correction will be far more acute than in March.

The market’s done better under democrats than republicans. Some people only think short term and that’s what could cause a dip, but ultimately what matters for companies is their fundamentals and in a consumer economy more people being able to afford products is a good thing. Democratic protections for the middle class will help boost spending, therefore helping earnings, and ultimately helping stocks. Unlike some person whose thesis is based on a couple red days of fear, my position is supported by decades of results. 

The rich might get pissed for a few days and panic about increased taxes, but what we actually know about spending habits is that they’re much less likely to use each marginal dollar (the dollars saved through tax cuts) and put them back into the economy, rather, they simply put them into savings. Whereas marginal dollars going to the middle and working class are much more likely to be spent in the economy, thereby helping the economy. 

TLDR: Dems are better for the economy (as demonstrated historically), it might just take some time for the markets to reflect it

Average is $19 right now, but I'm still $1100 in profit from taking profits earlier, so now I'm hoping it doesn't dip below $16, which, by my rudimentary understanding of TA, should be very hard to drill through.
Thanks baby I feel better now. VXX lottos it is.

PLTR trending like a scam stock about to get delisted by MLK day. Dump that SHITSTAIN of a stock and put your money into VALUE stocks bros. Heed my warning....

Never made a profit, lockup period ending, downgrades left and right, high ass float, no meme potential, and getting absorbed by that mithril company

Actually, delisted by EoW tbh.
Idk what you retards are crying about. I made money today. Sack up
Absolutely. Comparing NIO, which only makes EV vehicles, to TSLA, which has a myriad of departments (for lack of a better word) is wrong.

Remember right before you buy something inverse it, because our first inclination is wrong.
What if they had shares to deliver but did not surrender them because they expected to be able to buy some for less shortly and would then surrender those, more cheaply obtained, securities?

That was the first part. It could have been better phrased, but essentially how do they buy back more shares then exist.

There are 100 apples in existence. they have sold 250 apples buy pretending they had 150 extra, now how do they cover it when they need more apples then exist? it's not like they can just buy shares and then resell to knock down that 150, because each sale would add another apple to the total.


ergo they cant cover?

Commodities super cycle. I wouldn't be surprised if 2021 was a rotation from highly valued tech stock (\*cough\* looking at you DASH) into undervalued commodities stock. So I expect more days where market is red overall but my commodity heavy portfolio is green. When things start to reach equilibrium (could be as late as 2025), I'll rotate into something else. :)

Yes but the 80K that died in 2018 from the flu was just a blip. Many of the people that die from Covid were going to die anyways. The average age is 79 with 2.6 existing conditions being obesity, heart disease or diabetes...

But let’s not talk about that and let’s focus on a 99.98% survival rate. 

Note my dad who had Alzheimer’s and was in hospice was listed as a Covid death though he didn’t die from it.

Compared to stuff like green tech, PLTR is not really going to move much. Of course they're 'linked' with some kind of underground black ops deep state military complex blah blah, but that's just the sector that's found the most use for their software, there's nothing inherently insidious about the way they analyse big data. I wouldn't see it moving much in either political outcome, the biggest price movement will be when they show some profit.

Three recent high-profile missing people cases in China:

[Meng Hongwei](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meng_Hongwei) - Chinese CCP member and former president of Interpol from 2016 to 2018. Suddenly went missing for about 3 weeks in Sept 2018 until China announced that they arrested him after demands from Interpol on his whereabouts.  Was subsequently sentenced in January 2020 to 13.5 years in prison. 


[Wu Xiaohui](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wu_Xiaohui) - former chairman and chief executive of Anbang Insurance Group, which in 2016 was the largest insurance company in China. Suddenly disappeared in June 2017. Turned up a few weeks later after China announced that they're charging him with fraud and embezzlement.  Eventually sentenced to 18 years in prison in 2018. 


[Ren Zhiqiang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ren_Zhiqiang) - Chinese CCP member and former billionaire real estate tycoon in China.  Known to be critical of China on various issues.  Went missing for about 9 months earlier this year only to turn up later to "confess" that he committed crimes for which China sentenced him to 18 years in prison.
Bullish because the options were bought at ask. Could be someones hedge now that we got some upside.

If it was worth the effort, there would be enthusiasm for it.

In 2018, LG Chem’s sales in the petrochemical sector amounted to around 15 trillion South Korean won. This was over half of the company’s total sales of 28.63 trillion won. After petrochemicals, the battery sector accounted for around thirty percent of the total.

Based on CA, NY, and NJ it's obvious which party has no clue how taxes work.

Remember that reddit is comprised mostly of people who lack any life experience, real life experience. Most people here have never paid a bill, lived on their own, or done much for themselves, let alone face adversity. That they have money to be here, and to be investing it indicates they are most likely part of the 1%, and certainly part of the 5% (nearly everyone in the US is in that category).

Democrats have the best PR, but a record that should scare everyone. Every major city or state they've controlled or control is a disaster, they've controlled Detroit and Baltimore for 85 years, and Chicago is not far behind, how are they doing?

Considering their overall history I'm astounded that anyone supports them, it definitely demonstrates the power of the media and Hollywood to control the narrative. They have some egregious positions, they have very few triumphs, and they are never held accountable for their failures. 

Finally, it should tell you a lot that they want to allow 16 year-olds to vote, the only people who think 16 year-olds are smart are themselves and 12 year-olds.

I generally stay out of politics, but how the democrats are seen as a positive force has always baffled me. They supported slavery, opposed suffrage, supported Jim Crow, opposed the Civil Rights Act (88% approval among R's), interned Japanese Americans, opposed Gay Rights (they exist because of the conservative principles of individuality, Bush and Robert's should be heroes, while Obama vocally opposed gay marriage).

The switch is an historical myth propogated by teachers unions wanting to cover for their party. One politician switched, and the segregationist Joe Biden (Harris's words), spoke at that politicians funeral and credited him as a mentor. 

Please correct me if I'm wrong, but I'm fairly certain that those statements are all factually correct (the best kind of correct), even if people "feel" the statements are "morally" incorrect. You are correct when you say "ffs people are so dumb it hurts", we often have a hard time of fairly evaluating ourselves.

Yea but why would you tie up 7k capital for 6 months to make like a few grand.
My price targets by May for TECK is $35 and VALE is $30. I think we will see movement in the 3rd week of January once CLF reports earnings. Most of the big miners will be posting afterwards in early-mid Feb.

Every short position creates a long position, because someone always buys what these shorties sell. I think the name used for those is "synthetic longs", but I might be wrong.  


That's why there's 122% institutional ownership of GME, because there are so many shorties selling to whoever they can

They want a blue sweep so their weed and renewable positions print but the overall market will drag it down.
There will never be a lockdown again. If they try to. The people will burn down cities
The Georgia runoff doesn't actually change anything except for maybe weed stocks and clean energy. Big tech will never get broken up/taxed/etc whatever people think will happen. Because most of the Democrats OWN these stocks (just see what Pelosi has bought last few years)
Thats because dems weren't favored.

I did it with $10K on SPY for 2 week period a couple of years ago in a Roth IRA and made a whopping $28.

This was when Trump trade war tweets were moving the market all the fucking time.

Of course any 2 week period in the last 9 months probably would have made a lot more than $28.

One thing I've realized is people aren't actually good at pricing in events. Like this Georgia runoff was known for a while but weed stocks don't move until today.

They absolutely will dilute. No question about it, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. Im confident of this as the biggest red flag that stands out in their financials is that they only have enough cash for 12 months (if they don't make money and/or raise capital this year, they disappear.)

Offering shares to raise capital is kind of the point of going public.. I'd be shocked if they don't dilute soon after their upcoming symposium.

Way to post this when it's dropped like 70% from ATHs. 

I made my post (see my history) here when it was 2 days before ATH when it was 110.

It's too late now. If you own the stock you might as well hold it.
$3500c 02/01 means you pay for the option/right to buy a certain number of shares for $3500 until 02/01, its buying contracts of agreements and not actual stock

so if the price goes up you can profit because you have access to the shares at a cheaper price, and i think you can sell the option itself and profit without actually buying/selling shares

True. Just shows how having money to "invest" and not worrying about $5k to $0 is the real ten bagger.
FSD is their advantage? That's literally the one point most people in the industry says its NOT their advantage, as other automakers have already demonstrated similar or better capabilities.  Batteries will remain a strong point for the short term,  of course, and in the long run,  might actually become the real money maker. Economies of scale might progress faster than you expect for some competitors as most are already using dedicated EV platforms instead of simply adapting existing ones. 

As much as I completely dislike Musk as a person,  I hope TSLA does succeed.

QS shows you how much bullshit can surround SPACs and how noobs who have no idea about SPACs get seemingly demolished one day out of the blue when all of the big fish in a SPAC start unloading. There are almost 450 million shares of QuantumScape outstanding. Former KCAC shareholders and their aggregate $230 million are only some 5.1% of QuantumScape’s ownership. Existing QuantumScape investors, including Volkswagen (VOW), hold 368.8 million—or more than 82%—of the public company’s shares, PIPE investors have 50 million shares, or 11.2%, and Kensington’s sponsors have 5.8 million shares, or 1.3% of the total.  If you haven't taken profits yet on QS you're in for a world of pain over the ensuing months.  And this is completely ignoring an insane valuation for a company that doesn't even sell anything yet.
Some asshole or assholes own 2500 shares of stock, they sold 25 contracts of 100 stock on the open market to have an option buy said stock at a certain price. OP took the dicks outta their ears for two seconds and bought those 25 contracts betting that the stock would be higher than what said assholes thought the stock would be. Said assholes now have lost the bet but made some short term money, and OP has enough money to pay for his wife's boyfriend's side piece's salmon exhibit.

Stonks go up
Amazing gains bro
I still think investors wont mind paying a premium for a good overvalued growth stock as the current environment of low interest rates, low taxes, declining dollar and bad bond yields are perfect for stocks. QS however is pie in the sky as their is no product for 3-5 years and it’s not guaranteed.
😬
Maybe Jack Ma never has been real? 😳
91% is owned by institutions so it can be a volatile sucker. Pretty much went parabolic due to FOMO after an earnings smash. Anyone who got in when earnings were announced are still up 30%. Those who jumped in a week after the fact got burned.
Found [Jack Ma](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/marvel_dc/images/5/52/Secret_Society_of_Super-Villains_Prime_Earth_002.jpg/revision/latest?cb=20190127064237) no need to worry anymore guys.
It does matter. This the shit that keep me up at night
Post proof

And you can still jump in now and I’m sure there are profits to be had

Stop doing drugs and use that money to buy GME
That would be awesome
Same boat, lost a few grand each day last week, spent my remaining buying power + Sold off profitable positions + deposited 100% of recently attained paycheck to BTFD on AAPL. After losing 10 points since Tuesday's ATH open, I think they're at the bottom.
Naw. They diluted their shares. It has a reason to drop lmao
If you think Jack Ma is dead, you don't know Jack!
The Trump era proved that tax revenue doesn't actually matter, why would they increase taxes when they can just increase spending and unilaterally redirect spending at the executive level?

If Trump can steal F35 money for his wall, Dems can steal F35 money on federal tendie programs.

Selling weeklies expiring Friday is best bet if you don’t want your shares to get exercised. The premium is not as big but you can reevaluate each week. I would say 20% OTM is a safe bet.
About as good of a chance that my SPY 275 by 1/8 will print.

Jack ma balls
Bro I'm no expert but I think anything that shoots up 33% in a few weeks and doubled from its lows are bound to give some of that back, especially if it's an index full of shit companies.
Oh yeah then you’re on a standard pay schedule. You could probably make more in the private sector but the experience will be solid on your resume for when you jump for more money in a few years
Just the beginning, my friend
Lol right now it’s looking bearish, but they announce a conference involvement for next week so looking to only hold short this week...rest of the year looks good for roll out calls considering the business they’re in

How ironic would this be?

Ya'll believe in quantum immortality?  I can think of two instances where I should have died but didn't.

1. Friend was driving and nearly had a front end collision with another car in the opposite lane.  If we had impacted the car, I'm sure I would have died/serious injury/disability.  Yet, my friend was able to maneuver back into lane moments before impact.  I'm sure I died that day (back in 2013).  
2. I was rear ended on the freeway going 60+.  My car's front end was gone, but luckily I escaped with a few stiches and week or two of vertigo.  

I'm high on this sativa and this thought came to mind.
bought Feb 20C calls at around 19.6
Literally any of those things is already done by hundreds if not thousands of better companies on those fields all over the world already. This sounds no different than people arguing that TSLA beyond just cars will control almost all aspects of our lives in 30 years because they make batteries and have some data lol. And pretty cringe too see that every time they get a new contract is posted all over here, they've been getting contracts all the time since this company was created 18 years ago lol. Also why would the governments of other countries would willfully decide to make business with a shady American private company with a questionable record to say the least, I mean I guess some wouldn't mind but it isn't like all the other countries are lining up to work with PLTR. Not saying it won't go up, probably it will and probably is a good investment because of how the market works now, but lets not pretend like this will become the AMZN of goverments of the world.

so you are saying Biden, who’s platform was to raise taxes to 28%, is not actually going to raise taxes with complete control of the three branches?

and then you are saying that raising taxes will do nothing to earnings?

are you fucking stupid? why do you think the market tanked today with news of blue leading polls? why do you think the market tanked in November on fear of a blue sweep leading polls before it realized there may not be a blue sweep and bounced back?
he lost since jesus. Biden wil grab his ass out
I smell an election lead up repeat. Sell off today, then pump on actually GA Senate Results.

Good question.. hindsight is 20/20. Tbh I didn’t expect it to moon this much
My point was that you were saying RH "deals with spacs all the time" and yes they do but only the commons, which is the point under discussion here.  They normally do not allow warrant trading, and normally never have to deal with it since they don't allow you to buy units.  This is an unusual situation for them that you're trying to paint as business as usual.

Still will be largely up to the states, there’s very little chance an executive order for masks compliance would be enforced nationwide. Biden could be like Trump and threaten to withhold federal funds for states that don’t comply but I don’t see that actually happening. More likely, Dem states will feel emboldened to lockdown harder with Biden in office, Rep states will blame Dems for tanking the economy while refusing to wear masks, Dems will blame Reps for spreading covid without any actual science to back up their lockdowns and business shutdowns, 2021 is just an extension of 2020, the roaring 20’s will take awhile to get going if we can’t figure out the vaccines.

Quick question though, did the market trend up or down when Biden got the nomination over Sanders?

Lol, I personally believe in this company long term. Yes it is a high risk stock which is why I am pulling my initial investment out once it reaches $10 and letting house money ride. Once I get more confirmation on FDA approval and ARK investment confirmation, I will start to average up.

Tesla had a market to grow into. GME is coming out of a dying market and looking for forge a new one. The reality of which is VERY unclear. What purpose will GME serve in the future? If you think it’s going to “be the steam for consoles” you’re wrong. That’s rhetoric by people out of touch with gaming IMO.

This has nothing to do with your post OP, but I saw your nick and remembered the time I met Tormund Giantsbane in the local pub one night. I was pretty drunk and taking a piss, when all of the sudden fucking Tormund Giantsbane, or rather the actor Hivju, who lives near to me came in. I was like "Thormuuund Giaaantzbaaaine" and he has like "Heeeeeeey!!" and I was like "You're fucking awesome, I love you in game of thrones" and he was like "Yeaah, you're gonna love the next season" (I belive it was s04 coming up) and I was like "fucking ayh!! .. TORMUND!! ".. And I was about to ask for a selfie with him, but then he took his dick out, and I was standing there with my dick out, and it seemed kind of inappropriate to ask him for a selfie, so I just left .. Annyhuu.. That's my Tormund Giantsbane story.

Joke is on the market I will enjoy
They don't trade units, which is normally the only place warrants come from. This is just a weird situation because Ackman attached warrants to the commons, so RH normally trading spac commons has nothing to do with this situation.

OP is completely correct that you'll get a different answer on what will happen depending on what RH rep you're talking to because they have no idea what they're doing.  I think his advice to switch to a real broker if you want to trade this weird spac is completely fair. I'd take it further and say anyone who has more than chump change in their account should switch to a real broker with a good support phone number.
They said there would be Jan announcements in one of the conferences they done in early December, specifically stated they were saving announcements until after merger

Battery tech will get them money - the 4680s do now what Apple promises they'll develop by 2024 - but that's not the greatest advantage. FSD is the biggest advantage, followed by manufacturing efficiency. If you look at FSD beta, it's at lvl 3 and will probably be released as lvl 4, maybe in March? Manufacturing efficiency is why they've said they're making a 25k car. Economy of scale(that no else has) and manufacturing innovations are going to drop the car prices pretty steadily.  Everyone else doesn't even have the ability to reach an economy of scale, let alone steal Tesla's processes and retool their factory.   


Brand Value is not going to be an issue for a while; as I said, I'm not convinced panel gaps are going to slow anything down when they're that far ahead of everyone else in cost efficiency and tech. But they still need to clean up their sawdust while they're innovating. I expect them to start prioritizing QC as they begin to mature.

Look what is happening in Hong Kong, dissenters and opposition. Why would you send your money to this awful regime. Remember the ccp owns all big companies in China via unions.

Thanks for the explanation.  If the deal falls through wouldnt the price drop back to 14.50ish as of dec 31?  You're risk is $16.00 - 1.20 = $14.80 cost basis.  Granted that's a pretty low risk.  Your costs if everything goes wrong is $30 x 200 contracts = $6000.

I'm not saying that will happen, I'm just iterating to see if I'm understanding correctly.

I figure with the warrants they can't be called for redemption until $18 which is $6.50 intrinsic value, so even though $3.00 is pricey for a stock at $12.50 it also gives me the potential to double my money as a lower bound unless the stock stagnates under $18 for 5 years.

The best case scenario would be that the stock doesn't go above $18 until it has really high positive momentum - shooting up to $30 in under a month and imparting a very high intrinsic value to the warrants.  Since they'll be exercisable in 2 weeks they should start tracking those huge spikes a lot better at that point.

It's a gamble but when the downside is the company completely failing to execute their business plan for 5 years, I think I can live with that risk.

There’s a chance that nio will dump a bit after the 9th, but I would say that’s a good buy. Just sell on the 8th if you’re worried. I don’t see nio having a red day between now and the weekend so any calls with a reasonable premium should be fine
Nope
Worried today was the low
I just screenshotted what the page looks like for me:

Looks like it disappeared off the list after the 31st, and isn't there today. Is there something wrong with my page?

Edit: Could it possibly be that they don't have it on there during the weekend and they just haven't added it yet today?

Considered a superficial gain/loss. Gains are all taxed as normal but you don’t get credit for the losses until you cease to hold the stock for 30 days. 

Ie. you lose $500 in one day but you buy the share back the next day, the cost basis of the new share is adjusted by the pervious trade and you can’t claim the loss immediately.

Melvin initial thesis was very sound. Long e-commerce and short brick and mortar stores 

They were greedy as hell and in the end this will cost them. This pandemic has shown there is a place for brick and mortar especially when e-commerce is burden. This also made brick and mortar stores to expand there e-commerce also which helps bbby and gme hopefully if cohen takes over. 

They could have come out on top with gme and bby at $3 per share.

Remember folks, those ALL IN 🚀🚀🚀🚀 threads that you see, they are mostly posted by pimply virgin unemployed high school grads living in their mom's basement.
Because buying calls implies upside.
You buy calls to participate in the upside of the stock. The buyout price is at 16.50, you'd be paying 0.75$ in premiums to buy shares at 17$ at this point, basically paying 17.75$ to  sell shares at 16.50.
The only time this makes money is if they come back with a higher deal.
Buy high sell low I guess? Lol


You could indeed sell calls on it, but you'd have less upside. You'd be paying 17, selling calls for .75$, then selling shares at 16.50.
Max upside there is 0.25$
The only time this makes more money is if they come back with a higher deal.


Selling the puts, you make 1.xx$ as long as a deal goes through.
If no deal goes through, if shares are above 16$, you still keep the profit.
You'd only start losing money if shares drop below 15$ by june, which is now unlikely.
Bam will likely start buying up any shares they can get for less than 16.50$.

Yes, the image that 4chan used comes from the mission patch the National Reconnaissance Office drew up for their 39th launch of an american spy satellite.. NROL-39. National Reconnaissance Office Launch 39. 

It's a striking image, featuring an octopus with it's tentacles around earth in a firm grip. I decided that i wanted to remix /pol/'s version of this rather well known mission patch. 

You guys can read more about it here. And be sure to check out NRO's other mission patches as well, incredibly cool art if you ask me.

I’m not gonna touch options on it. Just taking a share position. I used to play the DIS channel trade for some tidy 20% scalps, and just lucked into having an open position when they unveiled D+. I’m not expecting anything like that for the same reason you mentioned, but before D+ everyone laughed at folks in Disney because “ESPN is too much of a drag.” 🤷
Always gotta think about the next election cycle. Being very “radical” could lead to turning away moderates and this is the party of moderation. If the party wanted to go so far left, why are Pelosi, Schumer, and Biden in charge? Why not prop up your “radical leftist” leaders in congress and make them the face of the party?

Exactly having to pay probably the biggest tax bill of my life in 2020 because decided to clear a traditional IRA to a Roth.  Last year was the perfect year to do it for a variety of reasons so don't regret it especially with what tax rates are going to look like in the future with Boomers retired but being able to do the back door Roth without a big tax bill is even better.  Getting as much money as you can in a Roth is what you want to do while you are in the 25% bracket or under.

I bought a bunch of t calls a week or so ago and even though the stock finally went up and it's above where I bought the calls my calls are worth half of what they were I want to believe the stock is going to go up but there is no enthusiasm on Wall Street for it to budge I think DirecTV is pulling it down they're about to eat billions of dollars in losses on that thing

I'd set a slow limit order of small chunk of cash starting at $4.5, $5, $5.5 and watch the stock's fluctuations tomorrow. This stock has a tendency to pullback $1.00 or so after a 100% run up.. I have a feeling there is going to be a sell off into a new support. It'll reach $10 in a month or two once FDA is approved. 

Cathie's ARKG team has already reached out to BNGO on twitter. So there's some rumor there...

&#x200B;

But then again, it could just rocket. I don't know, do your research! I'm in it for the long haul. Long term i see this at $20+. Will be pulling out my initial investment once it hits $10+ and letting house money ride

Agreed 401K to 401K is the way. You will have to pay taxes on your 401K balance if you roll it over your a Roth IRA. You don’t if you roll it over into a traditional IRA. Things to think about. There are considerable advantages to a Roth but it becomes a big point of consideration if you’re rolling over a 100K balance 401K and want to put it in a Roth. That will be a big tax payment. 

Back door Roth IRA beyond the Roth income threshold is possible but you need a zero balance on your traditional IRA for this to be possible.

I've always dreamed of hitting big on TSLA puts. But men have lost billions on this fool's errand. I've stared at its chart, looking and praying for weakness. You know what I found? Nothing.

Will it have a big red day here and there? Yeah sure. But would I be able to buy a put and make a 20 bagger? Hell fucking no.

I'm sure men have killed themselves over their losses shorting this shit. Screaming into the void about how it doesn't make sense and how it can't possibly maintain this valuation. Don't pursue your own demise. Be on the side of Musk or stay the fuck away

i think pets are different than games, people treat pets as another member of the family, there are high recurring costs for raising a dog, like food, cleaning, toys, etc.... but with video games its pretty cheap, you just buy some rpg and play it for hours.... used games are super cheap esp. if they are a console generation back. you don't need to bring your PS5 in for a yearly check up and your Xbox series X won't get cancer. the margins are much lower for games and gamers imo and gamers are more price sensitive.
Trump ain’t leaving. He didn’t lose jack shit
It's the beginning of the 1st quarter man, historically it's the lowest part of the year on average. I think GME will get some momentum personally. As long as it's above $16.20 (RC's buy-in) you should be pretty good, I'd just say hold and pray, I don't know if there is a way to minimize your loss without maximizing your risk at this point. That's the risk of options trading

And it is actually well understood that the Democrats taking control and possibly undoing the Trump tax cut could make the market drop it's a very simple point a to point b conclusion because it will affect corporate profits.  Not making a prediction off of -1% down day I cited my reasons why this could be a bad week and those are all good reasons to not be leveraged or have short call positions. by really don't need some dip shit like you calling me a retard Jesus Christ you sound like a fucking mouth-breathing moron

Is it really that big of a deal?
So if the MS Azure platform is used by a bank to find fraud (which it is because Ive fucking seen it), that makes Microsoft a fintech company as well? It's a tech company and you can look at the fucking definition of fintech on Wikipedia if your smooth brain enables you to read a whole paragraph. Just because tech is used by a financial institution doesn't make it fintech if it is used by OTHER INDUSTRIES for OTHER TYPES OF APPLICATIONS.

You're the one who made a post saying this sub needs to band together to take a claim to the sec with precisely zero evidence. Talk about triggered.
So many opportunities for big gains if I just rode momentum. Instead I tried to buy the dip. Luckily I'm bisexual so i ended up green on the day switching to puts.
I feel like I'm buying at the top, but I guess it could go up to 40 usd before correction. Or just never stop going up. Fuck it I'm in
Cramer dont you fucking mention my Spac you SOB
I bought the dip so it’s either shambles or lambos tomorrow

Most times these are posted in the middle of the trading day. The stock would go up one more hour then wham, drops like a fking rock.
Whenever I wanna get in the zone I watch The Big Short 🤌
I sold most of what I had. But even for the little bit that's still in there, I was surprised by the one-day volatility and downside.

Honestly, as much as it is fucked up it isn't our business, and there isn't anything we can do about it. The only real way to stop it without causing other issues would be what I said above. A war would be more destructive than constructive. This is a situation similar to the Nazis. If they had kept to themselves they would possibly still be killing jews today.

He told me he wanted to take on more risk. He wouldn’t buy more than he was comfortable with. Plus its not options, so as long as he sets a stop limit- he’s not going to 0 on the position.

Sold my GME after going to one to buy a controller, none in stock, only a shitty used one that ended up not actually working. Checkout people take 10 million years to do anything in an empty store, presumably because their inventory system is garbage. Only people there are Mexican parents. Probably one of shittiest retail experiences in any store I've had in a while.

Went to Best buy after and got one, in and out within minutes compared to the 40 minutes in line I spent at GME.
You go there with 645 dollars, you are literally a king.

You can roll over a 401K into another 401K. That being said I’ve rolled over mine into my IRA like you said. What surprises me is that you can contribute to your 401K more than 3-12:1 depending on your employer contribution, and yet this low balance exists. It may also say something about how long people are holding jobs before moving on

If they can just upscale.

I've been kinda figuring out how people are messing with this stock and I've made some decent timing plays just from stock. Doubled my account since elections after a 36k loss doing random spreads prior to elections, I'm expecting a push to at least 14-17 in the next month or so.

Electric car is not a rocket science. In fact, toy cars from the 80s and 90s were mini EVs. But it took a visionary like Elon Musk to bring the concept to business and scale it to profitability. He wanted to make this world a better place. Today, I regret to say that Buffet, Bezo, or JP Morgan are not Elon Musk and that health system in this country will continue to rob people of their money for basic human rights.

Goddamn America is great! And supposedly 70 million of you kowtow to a fascist like Trump willingly, the loyalty oaths are the same as what the CCP requires basically. So I'll give Bezos and Gates props for not going along with Trump's BS. The CCP is going to realize that it is preferable to allow powerful businesses rather then be stuck under government controlled everything hopefully. They are going to kill any entrepreneurship in their population if they don't, Jack Ma should be idolized as a good example of business acumen, instead they disappear him. Sad

I think IPOC is a solid company for the long term, so value might stay steady long term and might go up. IV will probably go down over time though, so what I can make selling monthlies might go down as well. 

But still, I like the company. Not opposed to owning lots of shares of it. 

Not sure about PSTH tbh, do they have an acquisition target?

Listen here you retards. This is not a political post. This is a $$$ post. If Georgia Senate turns Dem the weed basket gonna squeeze so crazy. Trade your plan, but cool opportunity presenting itself here imo. Especially since it didn't run as much as $ACB or $TLRY today.

🚀🚀🚀 I like Weedmaps (SPAC ticker is banned but look it up) 🚀🚀🚀 - all my friends in California use it. Super convenient and tracks the delivery. Apparently 50% of all dispensaries in the states use weedmaps, and the average order price for the platform's customers is $100 (vs. $50 in store). Can easily see why 18,000 dispensaries go with weedmaps paying them $500+ a month for their Business in a Box product.

Weedmaps parent WM Holding Co. going public via merger with Silver Spike Acquisition Corp

* Weedmaps is dominant cannabis SaaS player and consumer marketplace
* Revenue quadrupled to $160 million in 2020 from $43 million in 2015
* Revenue forecast to grow at annualized 40%, Ebitda at annualized 55% through 2023
* **Weedmaps operates high-margin marketplace services and never “touches the plant”**
* Weedmaps generates $1.5 billion in gross merchandise volume (GMV)
* Stock trades at enterprise value of 5.6x 2022 sales, well below SaaS comps

tl;dr: Buy Silver Spike Spac / Weedmaps for the 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Yeah but we will see how much sanders and AOC put pressure on him to do some radical left ideas.
It’s also ran 150% in like the past month and has tiny revenue.  Very easily can turn into a pump and dump.  Besides IV is already high enough don’t need people from here flooding in.

Amyris? Lol. It’s up 150% in a month...if only I would have bought more at $4....
honestly if u think the election would have any result at all buy spy calls. literally that easy
I agree with you. I've noticed this stock ticker typically reels back $1ish after huge 100% gains. Probably a fast dip to $5 -5.5. Good to set limit buys. I 100% expect this to hit 10 this month.

Once the 10 hits, i am taking my initial investment out and letting the rest ride to play house money. If it dips below $4, i am full on double or tripling down for the long haul. I see this stock north of $20 long unless they dilute.

Will play it by ear after it peaks $10 and whether Cathie confirms entry or not
I think you’re the pathetic one for taking the time to comment this. If you read my post you’d comprehend that I’m just trying to understand the full situation and don’t want to make an emotional or whiny statement. But you did give me a good laugh, thanks! :)

If I’ve learned anything from this election, or 2016, is that polls are fucking useless and nobody has any idea who will win. 

Also Biden is a centrist and him being president means not much will change when It comes to the market or big business. Or much in general...
So annoying hearing bears gey/fked. Speaks volumes of your insecurity of the junk you got.
If im trying to get a hold of somebody and the person has no clue of want talking about then says “Ill have him call you back” 2 weeks later nothing, I dont think he understood a peanut of the matter of my call.
Lol people rebutted your DD, why not address those rebuttals? Otherwise shit DD.

I foresee GameStop becoming a replacement for the LGS model.  
They had a couple test stores set up right before the Rona and they were a great success that became quickly overshadowed by the shutdowns.  
A reopening of those models times with the overall market return would be CRAZY.  
The number of people who have now taken to board / TCG / video games over the last year merging into a single brand name location. If they opened the name to a franchise model and offered to let LGSs come in.

Not that this is unique to EVs particularly, but price of the sedan will be a big decider on how much of a catalyst it is. The MPDV starts at $33K, which seems affordable. If they can undercut the Model 3 with a product people will actually want, that could make a big splash.

Tony Aquila seems to me like the kind of guy who'd be just fine with adding the option to outright buy the lifestyle vehicle if that made more business sense than staying married to the subscription model.

>“Some critical mass of the market has concluded that Tesla will win, I guess,” said Musk on the stock’s increases. “I’ve gone on record already saying the stock prices have been high, and that was well before the current level. But also if you ask me, do I think if Tesla will be worth more than this in five years? I think the answer is yes.”
Haha
NBC has to make that move. Why else would anyone pay for peacock?
Hmmmm. I might as well.

2020 fucked me in more ways than one. I think the biggest mistake I made was not jumping on shit as soon as I read it here, but weeks after.

it’s an automatic downgrade in EPs you fucktard.   

it doesn’t matter about what you think that “they won’t raise taxes cause of pandemic durrr”

it’s about the possibility that it will happen that will crash the market because that was biden’s fucking platform which was to raise taxes and it was a platform he talked about DURiNG the pandemic

Word of advice here for fellow retards: maybe roll these puts to expire after earnings.
Because access is restricted so we can reserve doses for those who really need it. But if we can double the available doses then we could just have drive thru inoculations.

If you think a 7% tax increase = massive sell off, you got another thing coming. Plus, wasn’t that increase going to come even if Trump was re-elected? 

Lastly, what do you think is going to happen in the middle of a pandemic if the Democrats win? Raise taxes? Nope. More stimulus, including $2000 checks and more. And where do you think sheeple spend $2000? At fucking Apple, Amazon, Walmart etc.

Actually, according to repeat costumers, their QC and delivery have deteriorated recently. Its much easier to do QC when your delivering 10k cars a year than 100k a month. Its no help that their service network hasn't nearly kept pace with their costumer base. 

Tesla's greatest advantage is their battery tech and their brand value. Unfortunately for them, its increasingly difficult to keep that edge in battery tech ( rule of diminishing returns) and brand value is also very difficult to maintain (for the previously discussed reasons). 

Elon dodge a rain of bullets so far, but the real fight has just begun.
Jeff Bezos losing his eyebrow hairs rn that greedy fuck. They’ll recover, their next earnings will save em.
Any reason you went with the higher strike?
If they can double dose then state and county health officials can relax requirements and people can just queue up for the shot.

I also like tying it to tax your taxes. Basically pay HoHs and single filers with stimulus to get the shot.

I've decided to change my options strategy. I was gonna accumulate TDOC 100 shares and sell weeklies. But kind of pain in the ass with IV not that high. 

So i'm gonna do that with IPOC. Alraedy have 300 shares, so might build to 1,000 shares. And sell monthlies on it. 

One big risk on IPOC is taht it is Medicare. And with covid lots of elderly are dying and that is all Medicare market. So market is shrinking? 

Also are the dems gonna do medicare for all if they win georgia? I don't know what that looks like for insurance cos.

Don't get in until it dips below 5.


I got a couple hundred shares at 1.60ish, sold at 6.60. 

Will almost certainly hit $10, but not before a big sell off. Waaaay too much volume for people not to take profits first thing tomorrow, especially with the after market drop.

Not that it’s really feasible, but 20%ing your options portfolio daily  starting at $1000 would make you a millionaire in 38 trading days. Something to keep in mind about positioning and taking profit.

Today was a huge red day for NASDAQ do you think that it will rebound or that we'll continue to go down? Most likely we rebound and go higher. Options will have huge swings, I had options go down to -80% then swing back green. If you don't have the stomach for those types of swings you should stick to shares.

Agreed. Although we are still severely undervalued at this share price even without RC’s involvement. Look at current market cap vs revenue. They can’t hold this thing down forever...revenues will be too good in 2021 thanks to new consoles and balance sheet is going to benefit immensely from closing 1000+ under-performing locations.

Read what I wrote again. I didn’t say get the lowest lows. I said wait for a stock price to tell you it’s going higher. Google buy/entry points to see what I’m trying to say.

Look at TSLA for an example. When the stock broke 465 (resistance) traders saw this and poured in.
that's bullish.

No, I'm saying the insurance industry shouldn't even exist. It only fills the void caused by the lack of a public safety net. 

If your primary house burned down, the government should have to pay for the structure. 

I could agree with a private option for belongings, second cars, and vacation homes. But I think the vast majority of the industry, especially the health industry, should be the job of the government. ffs they just have to buy like 20 less missiles a year to swing it

Yeah, everyone on wallstreet disagrees with you.

17 mutations in the new covid strain. 

That’s not a small number. 

Guess how it happened.

They think it was the result of keeping someone alive and intubated for over 100 days.

I’ve read the literature. I’ve done the DD. But I just want WSB to tell me if the vaccine is going to work on the new strain. ‘Tism beats science every time.

Senate control will be decided.  Investors are slightly worried about dem wins (which is about 50% chance at this point) because then Biden may raise the corporate tax rate from 21% to 28%, which equal roughly a 10% drop in corporate earnings.  But dems will also push through much more stimulus so i doubt the market moves to much either way depending on the outcome.  Investing aside, a dem sweep tomorrow would be good for this country, far to much shit wrong to be able to stomach 4 years of gridlock.

I think we see a little continuation to the downside tomorrow. We had an outside reversal day lower which usually represents a shift in trend. We had one of these a couple weeks ago but nothing came of it. So idk.

Also that's not how missles work. They arm themselves right before impact. They don't fly through the air armed and ready to go off. If they did then turbulence and any kind of birds/debris would set them off. When they get shot by those systems you just have unarmed missle pieces falling from the sky.

Fuuuuck
It sounds boring but just keep dollar cost averaging into VWUSX. Don't get distracted by all the YOLOs you see around here. When it comes to your 401k/IRA just stick to index funds and max out as much as possible every year. If all else fails in 30-40 years you'll be set with your retirement thanks to your 401k/IRA contributions. Best of luck Captain (.)(.)s

Positions a bunch of calls that aren't being hurt by covid, and spy puts and uvxy calls to hedge.

Not true.  In September I bought Oxy and it bled a little each day.  Every day a little bit lower.  Then in Late October that shit doubled in price from where i bought it.  You can be wrong for a long time, and then suddenly be right.  If your buying options you have to be right that the market has the wrong price and have with perfect timing.  If your buying shares you just have to be right that the market is wrong about the price.

“The S&P 500’s best year in recent history — 1995 — started with a small decline on the first day. It’s a 50/50 chance that the market will be up or down following a first-day decline,” -Lindsey Bell 

Worst first day in recent history is extremely bullish
Ok! I bought APHA today, so I guess we're all in a similar boat now..fingers crossed!
ARKG a buy now, 104.21c 4/16 going to print
yes

Today is probably the run. Also I'd gladly get exercised at 60 lmao
I'm expecting to see GME go sideways between $16-$20 for another month or until Cohen's new role becomes more than speculations. Once he solidifies GMEs new direction, bears r f'kd.

Bumble is the biggest piece of shit of a company and app imaginable - which is unfortunately why it will probably overtake TSLA.
I think a lot of people did but went in on clean energy sinve weed stocks are a bit of a hit and miss.
Do you see PLTR as a defense stock or a tech stock? I think that’s where the misalignment is for many, myself included. Tech stocks can lose money and still grow. Workday and Twilio for example.
Hold steady.  We’ll rise back soon enough
I heard the dems are paying black people to go out and vote so i wouldn't be surprised if they win it.
this sub is literally just the same GME post every day. we get it. smart man has stake in GME. GME might go up. Short squeeze. nice!

That’s makes it sound like 100,000 will die between now and March in the U.K., which isn’t true. Around 75,000 have already died from the virus in the U.K. - another 25,000 by the end of flu season isn’t irrational.

Republicans are not motivated to vote and there are even boycott efforts (more retarded than GME calls), on the contrary Dems are extremely motivated.

There's a reason the betting lines have been moving far in the Dems favor over the last week.

There are rules around what sort of stocks you can promote on here to avoid market manipulation. My guess would be that he posted a ticker with < 1bn market cap so his post got auto blocked until he edited it out.
FOR REAL RIGHT. Like we are not here to be your Jackson pollock canvas for the verbal splatter you are vomiting out.
The threshold for limit down needs to be much lower. If any stock goes down more than 2% in a day, they need to cut that shit out.

Emailed robinhood today for my QS refund. Explained i was not really satisfied with the product, as i was led to believe that it would increase in value.

https://thefly.com/landingPageNews.php?id=3219034&headline=SNOW-Snowflake-gives-notice-of-early-lockup-release-date-of-January--

They already announced the lockup date with an 8k filing. All set for Jan 7th, link above, the shares will be available to sell. 

I see the floor around $250 because that’s where interest was around post IPO, I think buyers come in at that level to support dilution. Maybe not the 300m shares in March though. Then shares spiked from 250 to 400 irrationally after missing last earnings, so I think 250 is probably where it settles then more than likely rises until the next lockup. Assuming the market doesn’t completely sell off
Oh my god I feel it I feel the power 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
What polls say
I don’t think they’re going to be able to do much more than what happened today. Basically back to RC’s last recorded purchase block price, anything lower they’re going to find a lot of buyers and get themselves dig in even deeper shit, if they are selling naked here.

I can't speak for all brokers but I know RH tries to excerise if you have buying power or sell by 3pm on the date of expiration.
Somebody posted a graphic on  stocktwits that has the FTDs over a span of time, showing the big spike recently.  That said, it's tapered off some, but  still happening.   There was one day (in December, iirc) where it was like $30M worth of FTD shares.

This week was going to be a shit show.  Plenty of people holding off taking profits until after the 1st of the year.  A slow motion clown coup.  And an election that might hand dems total control of government and guarantee Trump tax cuts for the wealthy and most importantly corporations gets rolled back.  That alone risks a 10% correction.  But then the market will realize total dem control means another $2-3 trillion going to be pumped in.   Next week we rip higher.

At one point it was worth more than Northrop Grumman, and I’m pretty sure just the single ICBM contract NOC got in the fall last year is more revenue than Palantir has ever made, ever.

if you go to the latest S1 doc you'll see a breakout of all the locked up shares, but basically the shares and warrants not in that big 2nd row (200+mill shares) became eligible for trading as of today (doc was filed 12/31 but approved by SEC today before market open) that big 200+ lot is a mix up freely traded stuff already and stuff still locked up with more details on the original s1 doc. too lazy to read it all but basically a big ol chunk of early investors were allowed to sell starting today.
prob no connection between the two
It was a great short term play. Don't expect this crap to get back to 100 in a short term. They literally have nothing until 2025 besides a cool story with some unique characters.

This dude has been killing it on his picks. I’m in for 1750 shares of bngo. I had 1000 it at 1.70 originally, sold out at 3. Then bought back in at 3.80 for more after I watched his conviction video.
Never heard of em
That's fair. 

I still have some growing up to do on that subject.
very sorry bro, that's really rough.
It's okay, you'll never get this chance again.

MRNA, ZM, NFLX and AMZN. Buy your lockdown stonks now. British media says the novel COVID19 variant is going to cause hospitalizations to sky rocket across the world. Their modeling in Britain was showing 100,000 dead by March. Take your gains and hunker down!

Lmao was a good play if you timed it well like me, bought at 12 and sold at 24. But that’s ok you’re the one buying puts on VXX in what’s going to be a very bumpy Jan. Nice play!
damn bro u/freehouse_throwaway those are realy nice.. wish you can keep doing them daily 👌

Google sells advertisements. Sure they do other things too and I think they are a good company to invest with but let's be real, they are more of a marketing company than a tech company at this point. At least from a revenue perspective.
Can you recommend videos you watched to help you understand calls
Sounds like a decent reason to start investigation by SEC already, right?

on VXX? yes

What's your take on the drop so far? No news but steady drop every day
there's a reason why baba was $320 in Novemeber and is now $220.  There are now 7 glorious reasons.  If you don't actually know how we got here then you should rethink your position.  Because BABA looks tasty but could be crippled for life.  I'm not kidding.

i bought it at 23 then bought more at 27 thinking 27 was around the bottom
Yea you’re right. Did I mention I’m retarded?
The drop at open? today 150k shares were dumped on the market by short sellers on the face of low volume, that and that alone is what dropped todays price by $1ps
Laughing at how wrong you are right now. 😂

Just remember me, BFT is gonna make me several million while your trolling people from yo mamas spare room.

yup, gotta love the dem voters. stay at home good for nothing SSRI popping losers. Never do anything in their life so just want the hand outs one after another. Thats why ya'll are some of the most weak willed people. Goes for both sides but dems vote for that

Selling the country out to China, one elected dem at a time. Thank god most of the voters will never amount to anything except sitting in a padded room
Dems lose 1 of the GA Specials (they need both wins), Mcconnell puts the kibbosh on all of Biden's Green new deal pipe dreams for the next 2-4 years and continually talks up the destructive loss of jobs from their crazy schemes (not too far from the mark tbh). All the clean ETFs crash then trade flat forever. enough of a reason yet? buy if it becomes clear the Dems will win both, for then they mite have a chance if they get rid of the filibuster.
as if we will know who wins tomorrow. HA
This is the way.
Too fucking real my dude 😂
CRSR will be 50+ in February. You just need to be patient with this one. Don't FOMO when it's mooning if you can't hold CRSR when it's down.

Is the last minute price surge before closing bell on RH a glitch, or is that related to volume?

For example owning apple contracts at average price of 1.91 and its priced at 1.91 or lower during the day and then jumps to 2.15 last minute before close. 

Has happened before, but didn’t investigate.
Geez, at least your arms will look great after all that bag holding.

Oh boy bears in here already in denial with the “no way tommorow is going to be green” you already had a sell off today now you’re wanting a crash? No reason for a crash and now stocks are on sale so I’m guessing it gets bought up AH/PM and we resume as normal for bull run? Idiot bears seriously at least have a REASON for believing in a crash instead of just blindly buying puts because you saw red

What happens if you sell call options and they expire in the money? The person didn't exercise it maybe because they don't have the money to do so or never intended to. Do I still have to deliver the shares? Does it automatically take my shares and sell them to the person with the option at the strike if they have enough cash? What if they don't have enough cash?

Go back to talking shit on twitter slut.
If big oil does not recover, the entire Fed intervention will be for nothing.

Gas prices are a major contributor to inflation. Cumulative miles driven is down 25 billion miles in October. There are 20M or so people still unemployed. Average mileage for someone is 1,000/month. All of the folks who are still unemployed are not driving to work, which is causing major demand shocks. The only thing that is allowing them to pay down debt is the savings on fuel.

If oil companies get tired of missing out, they will just start raising prices without the commensurate demand rebound. If gas prices start to rally up without unemployment coming down, we might get stagflation.

So basically, if the shares trade over 143 for two more days, Jan 7th they'll have a huge sell off for the 37.9M shares. I can't seem to figure out where it'll land after the dilution. Just curious to know how you're thinking of the floor being closer to 250? 

P.s. I am genuinely curious because this was phenomenal DD.

On TD it’s annoying more then anything cuz it’s always some small amount and I call them and they tell me it’s a false call. Buggy shit that it calculates when I have sold to open ccs. They still haven’t given me a straight answer for why it does it.

So my 401k is sort of stupid in that, the money that the company matches is sent back to me in a check at the end of the year.

Dunno where I should put it or if I should just buy more shares
Why are yall crazy about PLTR? Give me real fundamentals guys? I looked and it doesn't make sense.
Pacing to lose a quarter million this year 🤡🤡
It’s been pretty good on the spacs that go ballistic for no reason (the IV is bonkers so makes more sense than a put). This one was working fine until they changed the margin req so I had to make a decision between keeping them or sell a couple of baba puts when they collapse to 211.

agreed with these pussy contracts but, gme is a real meme stock not pltr. I think most analysts and traders don't know what pltr does at this point, given most of them are either tards or econ majors. the guidance for the company can expand pretty fast quarter to quarter. In tech, pussy contracts lead to bigger ones long term as well, whether you believe that or not...goverments also tend to stay with the devil they know versus new tech making it sticky.

Gonna hold until end of the week. I think a lot of people are invested in the outcome of tomorrow’s senate race, once that’s over with they’re going to be looking for somewhere else to stick their gains. The next major catalyst on 1/9 is NIO day, so I believe NIO will have a run up towards the end of the week.

Haha thanks for some credit and link. Nice DD you did with additional information.

And yeah I agree shares is the main way to go here, but FDs *could* be a fun lotto ticket. Should be going up, earnings miss would be quite the surprise imo. Lots of positive remarks from people shopping @ BBBY regarding customer interest and crowds aswell as far as i have red.

On Jan 6 I don't have any idea what's going to happen with the Trump protest in DC but I do feel like India is gonna beat Australia in their cricket match. Hopefully I'm not cursed to lose my next bet due to winning this last one with Liverpool vs Southampton in football

This seems extremely similar to the circuit city-carmax deal.


The owners of circuit city created carmax, believing it to be just okay, and then spun it off.

Also taking into account electrification of both commercial trucks and aircraft, shipping costs will eventually plummet as a new competitor enters the arena and undercuts the old players or they adapt themselves.

Thank you OP!
Valuations don’t matter until they matter.  That’s how the market works.  High flying stocks are vulnerable.  Ttd fundamental are obviously strong but that doesn’t matter if you see rotation
It's basically indifferent if you invest in Aphria or Tilray. Their stocks are now synchronous and you'll get 0.80 something TLRY for each APHA. 1000 APHA @3.5USD before it was cool. Irwin Simon is the guy to watch.

NVDA has been undervalued for too long. It was going to go wild today, but got cut down because of the market. It's going up.

This is just simply not the way. India is just a shitload of political mess rn, the hardcore BJP supporters are oppressing anyone who doesnt drink cowpiss. Before it was just Kashmir but now its farmers - 60%+ of India is farmland which poses risks of access to resources. 

Theyre trying to eek out development and better infrastructure but its really an uphill battle. 
Theyre wealth disparity is an absolute joke. Theyre trying to compete with China rn, and they won't win. Their R&D spending is lower and they dont innovate nearly as enough. Also the Chinese gov can oppress whoever the fk they want too in their nation but it simply doesnt work as well when Modhi does it. 

Like someone said, most of its price movements follow SPY so just buy that lol at least you have a federal reserve that guarantees tendies until 2023 (possibly longer)

Nurse! I believe a see a small wrinkle forming on this mans brain... it says “stop loss fallacy” on it
These US companies are too small to compete with TLRY. Sure they might have the ability to sell some products ahead of TLRY but once TLRY is allowed to sell they have the assets to steamroll them. 

A quote from APHA’s CEO in a recent interview:

“If you take Aphria and Tilray today, we've got a good-sized business in Canada. We've got a good-sized business and a good footprint in Europe. We have $120 million business in the U.S. today, which has opportunities to grow," Simon says. "But if we take the benefits from Europe and Canada, and we can move it into the U.S. at any time, or with our balance sheet, if it's to buy or build, we can invest. When this becomes legal, we'll be ready to move into the U.S. markets."

Although barely in the US market, TLRY has the infrastructure and resources to be very successful in expanding to the US.
Yup. Confirmed my suspicions

#PAY ATTENTION TO THIS FOLKS
holy fuck.
I’m retarded so I could be wrong. But his tweets Thursday plus a 950,000 share purchase after hours that same day = Ryan Cohen took his nuts out again as far as I’m concerned. Tomorrow is 2 days since that purchase so, if I’m right, he has to file 13D tomorrow.
Or restore market to pre Xmas level.
I think so.  EVs/Charging stations/Wind/Solar all rely heavily on copper.  Dollar printing continues and the possibility of large infrastructure projects as a means of stimulus are also on the horizon.  FCX is aggressively paying down debt and a looking to return to paying out dividends as well.
Let’s go
If you didn’t buy the dip just to sell tomorrow, you a foooool

Mods are invested deep into PLTR and will ,,delet dis,, any post that might compromise their folio.
Monitor the daily, wait for multiple to post about the same ticker mooning or drilling, then buy puts if it’s up big, calls if down big. I’ve done better doing that than holding for an extended period of time.

Wut
Their web interface is pretty solid, has a lot of data easy to get to (But who does DD around here anyway?)

For me I had to learn the lexicon to make sure I was doing the right thing.

I didnt have problem getting margin, I didnt have to lie but I already had like $50k in there in traditional stocks anyway, so they extended like 40k in margin power out of the gate.

I only applied for the "level 2" which is the highest before having to show that you're actually smart (or just lie your face off) which probably limited my margin ability but thats probably for the better at the moment.  

Took about 2 business days to get approved and I was good to go.

Sir, this is Wendy’s.
Right on man!  Although, always pay attention to the fundamentals.  Don't be afraid to sell if the fundamentals go bad, but right now I think they're awesome.

I laugh every time I see ‘I’m fighting for my fucking life out here’ and you know it’s a guy holding his entire $500 net worth on PLTR $50 weeklies lmao
Well if 300%+ growth rate continues Xpeng will surpass Nio in the first half of 2021. And in the end of 2021 they are opening the 2nd factory so less say double production capability. I can easy see 25-30k cars per month by end of 2021. Tesla only makes 500k per year and is worth 800B.

This line of thinking was all but confirmed (imo) when the institutions immediately put out hit pieces as soon as the stock ran up.  If you listen to interviews with Alex Karp, the only reason he went public is to allow his loyal employees liquidity after 17 years (and I believe it's a genius marketing play once you consider how much press they've gotten that HAS to be driving new business to insane degrees).  Karp also flat-out says he doesn't care how long it takes for people to figure out what they are, but that they'll be seen as the most important software in the world in a few year's time. The direct listing was completely in-line with this way of thinking and pissed off all the institutionals like Citron / Soros / etc. 

Institutions are pissed off that they didn't get their Bullshit first-dibs on IPO and are driving the price down until shares lockup ends imo.  This shit is going to the moon after Q1 or Q2 earnings, I'm in for 50% of my portfolio @14.50 (and holding) and buying as many calls as I can til then. 

PLTR is skyrocketing in the next 2 years and you can't convince me otherwise at this point.

Well, that's a complicated one, beating alternatives. I imagine it will if given enough time and without sudden drops to the underlying but at the same time as I said before it is capital intensive because it's basically what microtrading is, taking pennies at such a high rate and speed that you make millions through trillions of pennies.

It's somewhat complicated but it is studied and STCG is a weird benchmark because the nature of STCG isn't even static with it being progressive since arguably any LTCG of 0% is going to win. I don't know if that makes sense to compare.

E: Let me at least express that it is a compounding method and not a static method so when you consider holding long-term versus this you're comparing a curve to a line.
Pray that whatever benevolent force caused GILD to start climbing keeps up the good work and makes me some sweet gainz porn...

Yo they all got wiped somehow or something. I remember that used to be constant. Weird, maybe that means the top is in lol
Well honestly most people annoyed at GOEV is because they bought thinking they could make a quick buck with it. Now we are stuck for months with it, only to maybe see ourselves to positive or 10% again.

So about two weeks ago I bought some July 2021 $55c on $FLIR, thinking it had room to continue upwards over the next couple of months. Woke up this morning to an alert that an offer was made to buy the company, and I immediately started thinking about all the sweet gains I was about to bask in. Then the market opened and the price of the call option traded for less than what I paid.

Dear diary, today I learned how buy-out offers can render all those fancy Greeks meaningless.....
Was the coins dump this morning a warning for today’s dump?
Yeah same unless you bought Jan or Feb options you should be fine

NIO will go up, but more likely to spike.

DIS is a solid pick. Maybe later, some time after Biden takes office to see what policies may effect their parks.

AAPL I like the most.

Shorting a stock while knowing the shares are not available for delivery meets the criteria of abusive short selling, and it can be argued with short interest above 100% and institutional ownership of 130% that no reasonable person could believe that there are enough shares available to meet current short sales.

It would benefit me as im holding cash, but i just cant see it
Just buy 2 or 4 weeks out, at the money strike calls and rub on out every time your weak hands start to fuck up your plans 🤫
I mean honestly it just goes to show that even the "experts" don't actually know what the fuck the market will do. "Experts" sell research and DD because that's how they make their income. Not off the market but off of selling their opinions on the market.
I’m not touching weed stocks with my 100 foot dick. Got burned once by then before. This shit is basically commodities.
They have a lot of “controversies”, which worries me. I own a good amount of shares, but the controversies are definitely making me skeptical
I'm going to buy 100 shares of one of these and then sell weekly calls on it, and hold the shares for a year. I want the price of the stock to go up over the year, the more the better. 

Should I buy: 
TDOC? 
AAPL?
DIS?
NIO?

Something else? 

Thanks!

Yea it's Like having a devil and angel on the shoulder situation
From one of the articles mentioned;

“the companies are not just stopping there as they hold plans to enter the potentially massive US market. They have a head start too. While Tilray is headquartered in Canada, it is registered as a US firm. Further, in July 2018, Tilray became the first cannabis company to debut on a major US stock exchange. Additionally, Aphria announced last month that it would be acquiring SweetWater Brewing Company, one of the largest independent craft brewers in the US. This would provide an important distribution point south of the Candian border. Tilray also has a partnership with beer brewer AB InBev. This would put the combined company at the spearhead of the cannabis-infused drinks market.”

MA is back!!!!
No idea why WSB is so focused on a stock that has already more than doubled since IPO. They could have even went back to EV and made a shit ton of money rather than lose it all on PLTR
What are you talking about? You drunk?

If we are heading for a crash, WSB will do the same as in March. 

Sell for loss what we have now, get in the rainbow painted drillers and:

Puts, laveraged shorts, lavareged ETFs, hello old friend VIX, drill team 6 etc etc 

Will be back.

That is something I completely neglected to mention. 

The FTD’s are super suspect, and if proven to have spiked substantially recently, that’s is a huge SEC violation. 

If it’s proven that they are in fact borrowing those shares to short, and the buyers of those shorted shares don’t receive them, the borrowers will be up shits creek by not just the broker, but the SEC.

The problem is that GOEV won't have "real revenue" before 2022/2023. Currently it's pure speculation so I would tread carefully on this one.

Just took a trip over to r/investing and it’s filled with people that are “buy and hold” index investors that are too lazy and stupid to figure out how to deploy their capital. 

They don’t realize that the market doesn’t reward lazy and stupid. It rewards pure unadulterated retardation that knows how to take ‘ calculated’ risk. That’s why r/wallstreetbets will always be their wives boyfriends.
Not everyone is a shill for the U.S. government
Someone maintaining a low profile is now called missing :/
I think so. A correction is not a crash, it's just a pullback before the next leg up. It's already kind of in a correction anyway, but this would probably bring on one more bout of selling before the next leg up. Some solar stocks are down from the highs they just hit and stuff like FCEL and PLUG have been down a bit. BLNK got hit really hard though, not sure what's going on there.
When are the results decided?
Yup, if we stay in the bull bubble you just wait for the price to bounce back, and Tes got enough volatility to do that.  Just don't do naked shit like a real tard.
I sold one XPEV in morning and bought it back before end bell becuz it fell a lot during the day and NIO didn't
Averaged down on GME 💎✋
I have 40c’s for feb. iv is currently 60%
OPEN swung nearly 10 percent from the morning on no news?
This time you’re buying low, just remember to sell high.
I was nio investor from 3 usd per stock. But Nio is very limited by the fact they dont have their own factory and xpeng is building their 2nd one already. Xpeng also has the best growth from all EV companies. If Xpeng can full first mass produced EV with Lidar its huge for whole EV market. We might finally have full autonomous cars. I think market is just slow to catch up, like with nio success story.

Eh, I dont use the app much for buying, and tbh its a bit clumsy to do so.  I use the web interface mostly but for work im in front of my PC all day anyway.

I’ll just tell ya I’m up 200 right now but that could  be gone tomorrow because I didn’t sell so.... no lol
Most people got their stimmy end of last week/weekend. So, the money wouldn't be in brokerage account until tomorrow or WED. Coupled with GA runoff tmr and Mango rally/electors on WED, fireworks surely.
Tlry does not have material exposure in the US. 

Tlry and Aph is a Europe play.
You must be the one selling then
How long of a time frame are you looking at to invest? Is this $2000 an amount you won't mind tying up for a while?

I think buying it in the low $20's has a decent chance of a good return over the next year.

Mutual fund buying?

The point isn't whether it works, but whether it beats alternatives, especially after short term capital gains.

All the PIPEs are eligible after 180 days, today 60 million shares were eligible (hence the almost 1:1 increase in volume, ie 20m to 80m)
Interesting considering the fact that the SEC banned abusive naked short selling in 2008, do you have any additional data to back this up?

Supply is expected to meet demand
If I borrow something and don't return it in time, that's not without consequences for me, especially if it involves money. So when these fail to deliver, will their broker just buy the share and take the call from the shorter, or are they enjoying some very special perks like not having to return what you borrow? Seems absurd.
It’s a Chinese firm, I’m sure the person responsible is already dead or at least sharing a cell with Mr. Ma.
It’s time to switch brokers. Whatever the fuck it is you’re using.
Cramer said to buy? I feel even better about the position now...

Lol but seriously it’s ridiculously overbought + the 180k deliveries were actually bad news (relative to expectations which were for 190k+), only reason it went up today was because of the model y Chinese preorders
Wire it to my account.

My best was Amyrs because my wife is all into keto and PureCane looks pretty good.   The company seemed undervalued at the time.  I bought 500 shares at $3.30 been planning on just holding for a long time.
Would green really go through a correction though? Weed I could see but green energy will still be in much demand for the foreseeable future.

Bought VXX puts two weeks out at the top today feeling like a pimp
Yea I disagree with that rule but not my call. I’m here for the memes and to get a good idea of what not to do anyway. I was in BNGO since late last week and that worked out great for me. Got a trailing stop loss on it now and just going to ride it till I cash out. Before that I was in riot and did wonderful there as well. WSB burned me at the stake tho when I tryed to make a post saying “serious there is better plays then GME and PLTR rn but w/e. I feel so bad for people who jump into investing and just find this sub right away. Every once in a while someone post a good bet but it’s getting progressively worse and none even post bets anymore. It’s just a echo chamber retards donating to who every is raking it in from GME rn (it’s not the 💎👋s here. And even if this short squeeze Dident already happens from 3$ to 20$........  think about that.... but even if it didn’t what are they holding out for? Nothing but a chance to miss out on better plays.

I think they could potentially liquidate it immediately and give you the money. Technically, nothing illegal. But would potentially leave a lot of money on the table.

Hey I doubled my money on Pltr and rolled it in to GME.
He just kept saying nothing has changed and there’s only so much he can control 😂

It was on CNBC. I’m sure it’s on YouTube by now
May. Lots of time to be wrong, then not that wrong.
Ran this play in the lead up to the election and saw huge returns on my short term TLRY and ACB calls. I’d recommend looking into ACB options because they move a bit faster (in both directions) than TLRY. Beware of the red mirage, might be worth grabbing some short dated puts at open as in-person votes and GOP counties will likely report first. Remember...this isn’t about these individual companies...it’s about the hype surrounding them. Buy the rumour, sell
The news. God speed.

Why would you want a Tesla? If u made enough to buy a Tesla, buy something that actually appreciates like a rental property or more stocks .. cars are almost always depreciating assets, gotta stop thinking like a consumer
So puts?
Lol, Ford is 35B while Nio is 75B
Just bought my first calls ever thanks to your emojis
Bought TSLA and aapl calls at close, still holding shy of a thousand PLTR shares like a butt fucking retard.
There is options now. Bought some a few weeks back
No, it *does* work, but we don't know why. Basically in general stock prices the morning after are higher than the night before something like 70% of the time. It's incremental though. Ironically the odds of being able to hold a stock, if it goes flat the next day, and sell at whatever increment better is stupidly high too. 

Incremental sales are even more likely to occur. 

And no one knows why. Just like the January Effect.
Same with my NCLH. Just a blip :)
I presume if dems win then should recover this week for sure
Down 7% today. *This is the WSB experience I remember.* What if we get another mutated covid that gives you a zomboner
Fuck. GOEV
Why??
That's what a big election will do. Things will smooth out once Biden is in and Trump can't try to perform a coup any longer.
If Apple contracts with them. Tesla might be in.trouble. Both are good but Nio gets charging and battery time cut quicker then them.
Haha I'm in the same boat. But we gotta 🙏🚀🌚

Up until now I’ve always bought calls, this is the first time I’m buying a put...I couldn’t find any stocks to buy calls (was gonna do NIO but I didn’t feel comfortable buying calls no so close to NIO day) my only DD for buying a put on peloton is simply cuz the stock has ran up a lot the last couple weeks and it only makes sense that people are gonna sell to take profit. I’m up like $60 today already. But I’ll be watching my position very closely

conversely once you see a "gang" pop up it's time to sell all your shit and buy puts

see: QS, PLTR, GME, CRSR
Wtf happened to you guys? Why all this fear? You paper handed pussies, buy the dip 

My calls are safe af if WSB thinks we’re in for a “next leg down” while the internals at close were way more on the buy side
 You’d better off holding SPY shares.
A split gov was priced in as soon as the main election results started to come out. Remember, Dems seriously underperformed in House and Senate races.

Betting odds got VERY tight on Senate control over the long weekend. The uncertainty tanked the shit out of the market and big tech ate shit hard at the scary thought of the blue sweep coming to pass. You'll notice that solar actually was flat or green, because a Dem Senate would be another huge boost for them.

If Republicans keep control, market will go back to mooning, tech moons, and green energy goes through a correction. If Dems win, market is choppy, with tech selling off more and green energy booming.

What’s your reasoning behind this just out of curiosity? Tesla has been consistently opening high and is up $69 for the week and $112 for the month.

There’s nothing but positive news surrounding Tesla right now even Lord Cramer saying to buy.
I hope we do more grinding 🤓
its not
Yeah, it's strange. When I said there was a link with Ma, I meant in the way that all Chinese stocks suffered when the news came out. The reason I bought Xpeng stock was because I think the outlook is at least as good as NIO and the value of the company was a lot lower. 

I am in it for the long term. The Chinese electric car market is huge and Xpeng, NIO and Tesla look like they will be the ones carving it up amongst them. The Xpeng products are very polished and could definitely sell in the international markets too.

So the entire basis for investing in gme was to get in before earnings and hold till the short squeeze happened. Well the squeeze happened, so get the hell out. Gamestop is probably not doomed to bankruptcy but it's not something people should want to hold for long term gains. It's not paper hands if the conditions of exiting your investment have already been met.

Positions: doubled my investment off gme call spreads during the squeeze.

It depends on stock, movement, and basically my mood and patience for having to potentially up limit if its moving slightly up. In this case it was going up. And I hoped it would continue to (and it did for a while). So did market because limit at ask would have likely not worked and would have had to cancel and retry. Hindsight, could have at least done limit at like $0.05 over ask or something to protect this from happening, but 2% over ask in highish volume stock at time is just shitty in any scenario.  When reopening positions in TD, was watching pricing they got me in al trades and had RH open to monitor their stated price too and TD killed it getting near sell instead of buy price in most. On a few I was “up” a buck or two immediately on close. NEVER closed trade ahead of sell price on RH. Lucky to get in at buy.

Buying calls wouldn't make you any money at this point as the stock is trading at a premium to the bid price. You could buy shares and sell calls at a higher strike to keep premium + possible dividends, but I wouldn't do that.

Let's pretend that we are a rational bunch of people.

if 5% of GME is owned by members of this sub then that means 95% is not.

It turns out that even if we add 16 + 5 we still find that over 79% is not owned by anyone we "trust". 

So that other 79% needs to knock that shit off! Buggers.

It would take one senator voting with what they think their state wants, rather than what their party wants.

Politically, there is no upside. It isn't an issue that gets anyone elected, and enough people still have a negative stigma towards it. As an issue nobody is winning an election on, enough politicians will see it as only having downside risk. If it cant help taking a low % chance it hurts is still a risk you didn't have before for something you might honestly not give a shit about.

I think I came up with a way for all of us to become multi-millionaires. What if we pool our money together and start funding start ups like a venture capital firm? If any of them go public, we would make bank.
Isn't that a good thing, assuming it stays public? It has the backing of the government of one of the economic powerhouses in the world.
Nothing screams reserve currency of the future like nationalizing one of the biggest companies in the world.  Idiots.  Haha so much having to fear China economically any time soon.

My biggest position is NIO, but I'd wait for a sell off before hopping in massive jump today. 

BABA is on discount right now, great buying oppurtunity.
But TCEHY is my China under dog pick, most analysis shows its like $20 under valued as off now, but large consumer goods is what boomed with the American middle class and I expect the same in China as their middle class goes. 

Li is a great NIO hedge, and will  be competeing for a simular market. 

I have all of the mentioned postions. I totally agree with you, the Chinease want one thing and its $$$$$$. They are NOT dumb or overly egotistical. They will grow their middle class, and many investors will become wealthy as part of the process.

I doubt seriously that Orwell knew in the late 40s the extent of Stalin’s crimes against humanity. That really didn’t come out in the West until Solzhenitsyn’s Gulag Archipelago nearly twenty five years later. After all, the dead and imprisoned have a hard time speaking. I believe that Orwell was drawing on two things when he wrote 1984: the dark side of human nature and the history of the Inquisition.

I bought in and asked him what he meant and when this happened and it was clear that he was talking about the split.

This happened last time as well. It goes up after hour for some reason but then drops in tradijng.
Each options contract provides the opportunity to buy 100 shares of the company in question. If the market price of the stock rises above the option’s strike price, the option holder can exercise their option, buying at the strike price and selling at the higher market price in order to lock in a profit. If the market price does not rise above the strike price during that period, the options expire worthless.

I always ask this and I've never gotten an answer from Canoo bagholders and why hold an EV stock that doesn't plan on being on the marketplace until 2022? Not only is that when all of the major auto manufacturers plan on releasing their own EVs, companies like TSLA and RIDE are either already on the market, or will be next year. 

I feel like by 2022, the market is already going to be flooded to the point that there won't be price differentiation and barely any economic moats worth considering; FSR Ocean vehicle is made of all recycled parts for ~$30-40k but who cares when all other EVs are priced the same?

Chapter 13 is actually better for your credit, you wind up paying part of your debt over 3-5 yrs then it falls off you credit report 7 yrs from when you filed. Chapter 7 stays on longer and creditors look at it as you did not even try to repay what you owed and are less likely to extend new credit with reasonable terms
Also, if the board values it at 15$/share, then I still made a profit on the sold puts... (I got about 1.20$/share)

According to fivethirtyeight the Georgia senate run-off will be tight af. Thinking back to the Presidential Vote, counting, especially in the heavy populated democratic areas, and the democratic mail-in votes took days to count and for many days Republicans were leading.

So I would expect the same thing to happen tomorrow and would expect a squeeze in the weed stocks as long as Reps are leading the counts. Will go all in when they drop, if I think dems can catch up in the end and ride it to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

yeah i remember reading awhile back its like 180 days or something. either way the dump isn't over yet. there will be more being dumped on retail eventually.

staying the far away from this meme stock...
If the board values the deal at 15, then the 16.50$ bid is a premium.

The company-declared NAV is 27$ per share and they stated that the reason for the buyout is because the market's consistently undervalueing the business. It's unlikely the board will value it lower than 16.50$.

You should be able to view on whatever trading platform you're on, what your option is currently worth. If you bought at $5 per share, i.e. $500 per option, and the market price is set at $8 per share, it technically means that there's a buyer out there willing to purchase in which you'll make a 60% profit.

I'm on TD Ameritrade, for instance, and I can see a Trade Grid of buyers and sellers, their volume, and what exchange they're on. I use this to determine a price to buy and sell financial instruments.

You should really consider delta (volatility) and theta (time-decay) if you continue planning on trading options.

Ethnocentrism usually implies a hearty negative load of “their country and culture is worse than mine, because...”

It’s definitely the word for “racism of cultures and ethnicities.”  And when used, most who know the word know what they mean so we don’t pull out the “well, technically” because it is usually used technically well. 

People make new terms when old ones exist because they’re mostly uneducated and ignorant and don’t know the terminology they honestly wish to use.
I'm a bot. Recent empty self posts, noob questions, and spam which people were temp-banned for. Bans are 1-2 days to discourage posts that ought to be comments.

I had exactly the same thoughts. In the beginning ZoomInfo was great with maybe 90% of its data, last time I used them that went down to about 60%. And what makes me angry is the price! 

We stopped using ZoomInfo and switched to another service, which is cheaper, has a bigger database, which is updated all the time. They have a couple of very interesting features ZoomInfo doesn't have, such as educational info and diagrams. If ZoomInfo wants to stay in business, they would need to find ways to improve the service.

It’s only going to get worse for them. They are on somewhat of a high because everyone started requesting real meat in pet food. Margins went up. 

Well now 25% of all meat is for pet food. And you know the second leading cause of climate change?  Meat. Dog and cat food prices are either going to go through the roof (leading to lower populations) or food will start to go back to the old Dog Chow formulas with thinner margins.  Cats are carnivores so that industry is. screwed. Ultimately in 20 years pet population will be like equine. For reference there were more horses in 1987 than there are today’s and much of that is due to rising costs (though for equine it was because we actually started to treat them fairly). 

Not to mention all the other reasons I’m bearish - WMT PetRx, Petco IPO, Amazon pharmacy, etc.

The overall trend is still up. I'm very bullish on JD
Not sure what to do with SMTC...currently holding 250 shares (broke I know) and today they jump 20% on news of getting bought out.  Also seeing articles about an investigation into the sale which is interesting cause I felt like the buyout price was a little underwhelming.

Has anyone held shares up until a buyout? Cause at this point I’m wondering if I should hold until sale in Q2 2021, or sell now for $25 less than what I’d get then.

Thinking I’d rather have the money free to put into my other positions where it’d probably make more than $25 over the next several months.

I haven't been there for 18 years or so.  I'm originally from Detroit, though, and spent 2015-2020 in Oakland.  Oakland during the pandemic was what finally made me want to live in the suburbs.  Things got nutty.

I would still recommend Detroit for that type of vacation.  It's gentrified, but not like Bmore or Oakland.

Ethnocentric isn't a negative view of another culture like racism is for races. There really isn't a great word for racism but for cultures or ethnicities so most people use racism. You know what they mean so don't pull out the "well technically..." bullshit. That's why people made these new terms like neo racism or cultural racism.

Noticed this too - but its been entirely lifeless in the other recent dips it suffered and its been only 5 months since IPO.  Likely settling into its current comfort zone of 50-60, wouldn't expect any major pop, but a long play, perhaps.

Good question - I haven’t been able to find much news about it. Definitely some locked shares became unlocked, but don’t know how many. 

Can’t blame em though. If I got in for 10 or less you better believe I’d sell for 50/60 here as fast as possible too.
I actually hadn’t thought of that but I really fucking like your idea..

Wasn't that bad of a day for PLTR tbh. It showed strong support at 22.50. I was expecting it to drop to around 21 at the start of the day.

Almost the whole steel industry has been acting like that. Moon a little or flat then head immediately down at open, then after lunch go Back up. I met a guy swing trading CLF the other day actually. The steel companies are owned by institutions mostly. If I remember correctly, MT is like 70 percent. So I expect this to not be paper handed, to move slow, but to move up or down in huge chunks.

Personally, I think it's because you can see where you've made mistakes but there's nothing that can be done to make things better, not one thing. It leaves you feeling like an idiot, especially in the presence of others here talking about success. That's just my take when it hits me.

Up 21% in 2021 so far thx to buying SPY calls on the dip. What do you think?  Should I call it quits for the year?
I just looked into it. It seems when stocks have massive drops in price there way more sarcastic comments than usual. Ones along the lines of “imagine buying xyz stock right now” or “how many of you bought xyz stock at $80, raise your hand”

I noticed something similar a while ago when NKLA had huge drops as well.

I’ll need to find a way to correct that.

Which is weird because they should be way over 202%. Those puts can print 800% easily every time.
This is the way
I thought the first one sucked, seeing the second one created little emotion as the bar had already been ground level. I was pleasantly surprised.
I feel crazy going into this with no VIX position. 🤷‍♀️
maybe maybe....
I have a good feeling about VLDR spiking
If I had money not all tied up in PLTR I would. Holding
February. I'm waiting for the lockup to end, it's nearly guaranteed to be shorted until then so MMs can get in cheap.
More ICLN, in the Biden years it’s only going to go up. Get in now before you miss a sure 10 bagger
Puts.  Stupid autocorrect
No you must have forgotten that there is a mythical catalyst,  which will launch the squeeze, on the horizon.  Sure it may seem like a defunct vidya store akin to blockbuster but let me assure you their trade-in policy is second to none and with this catalyst, that will definitely happen, it will be at least $500 per share.  Remember to set sell orders at $100 increments!!!!'
I cant trade after hours on Etrade wtf, this is why Robinhood is superior in the chromies department
I'm actually looking to buy at around $20 if it gets there. I do have shares but since my bad experience with selling covered calls on AMD and missing out on the moon mission, I'm not touching that.
RIP PLTR
Over all all Market sell off expect MJ market. That’s where the money is gonna be if Democrats flip the senate.

There are too many GME doubters in this sub like wtf??? If you don't like it you can fuck off or you can at least help us so we can both squeeze the fuck out of shorts. This community is becoming pretty toxic...
This is cool.

If you scared to get in the market but tired of missing out on gains, buy vix related puts. They cheap and low risk. If VIX instead goes up, great, cause in all likelihood that means stocks went down and now you can decide if you want to buy in.
It's not that it shit the bed, it's that it was mega pumped in the first place based on nothing real.
Burry was a bit early, bled a lot waiting for those tendies.

Wouldn't it make more sense for the major shareholders in GME to report this? I doubt WSB users with 0.01% ownership can put any pressure on this.

Tsla looking. Kinda ripe for puts soon
Fuck that. I'm going back to how I originally thought about it:
In what world does Gamestop have a future? Steam dominates the PC market, Microsoft has the XBOX game pass, Sony has PS Plus, and Nintendo pretty much made bank on all major releases already with the Switch. Newegg and Amazon are the 1 stop shop for all console needs from the system itself to components and parts WITH major sales from time to time. GME might as well be the equivalent of saving a dying mall; its time has passed and can no longer survive in this day and age
I’m selling by Friday, not gonna take the risk and hold through nio day
Buy more NIO
They’ve been set up to fail by the government officials who stand to profit from them getting bought or by going under.
i don't realy understand how you would sell weeklies against a lea? can you give a example number wise thanks alot

Really wish I had opened it as a spread right now. Nothing to do but average down and wait for some good news.
Aren't you losing alot of $$ on those qs and qi calls?
what makes you say this? bc it fought back today?
I bought my first SPY put today, immediately lost $200. You're welcome bulls.
For every rewatching binge I smile to Rawls and think "you little dick loving ass hat I know who you are!" One of my favorite characters.

guess which company is branching out to PC parts and accessories?
Hold it till expiry
Maybe buy a hooker with that 800k
Your betting against Musk?? Man i hope you didnt care much about that money
Yeah, I dunno about this. Low severity autism is useful.

It was nice knowing you guys, been on a shit streak for months now and I’m going back to value investing.  Auf Wiedersehen!
what street you at?
I saw 1 trillion something so I assume GME will be buying Apple, priced in, let’s go.
I'll give nothing to anyone who will show holes in this thought. Well... let's already call it a fact:

The fact:

Covid 2.0 + Biden = More restrictions + Lockdown

More Restrictions + lockdown = 2k stimmy back on the table

2k stimmy back on the table = bullish

Bullish = Stonks only go up

It's pure math. Can't go tits up!

But it takes someone special to bring their family to the brink of financial ruin in one afternoon ❤
There's extremely strong support at 2$. I sold some puts at 1.5 expiring next week, and bought leaps a lil bit early so they're down 30%. But if this shit falls below 2$, then it's free fall from there. Not that it hasn't been in free fall for the past few weeks, but yeah
Nice, Just filed a tip 👌🚀🚀🚀

What covered calls are people selling on PLTR?

I'm thinking strike before earnings so can bail on the leadup.

I kind of held off today, was looking to sell them when it reached $24.5 again but never happened.
NKLA is the one true strong backbone of the US economy 💪

Hahahaha look, no more GME and PLTR spams....what a pump and dump that was!
Devil's advocate here. China is fucking evil and no sane person, including the Chinese people themselves, would stay in China if there were no barriers against moving to Beijing's democratic competitors. 

BUT, there's no rule that says only good guys win in history. More specifically:

The fucking insane amount of control that the Chinese state exercises over their citizens, including over their top billionaires like Jack Ma, might be an advantage in their geopolitical competition against the US. Freedom is nice, but it has always been a bit of a luxury. During wartime, for example, the first thing that disappears is freedom. We have a religious faith in the amount of good that freedom can do for our societies, but we are really about to test this shit right now.

People keep bringing up Nazi Germany, Imperial Japan, and the USSR, as examples of unfree societies that fell in the face of freedom-powered America. This is a really stupid fucking take. Germany and Japan were tiny countries compared to the ones that they were fighting against, and therefore never had any realistic chance of victory. The USSR was big enough to win, but they handicapped themselves by implementing the most God-awful retarded ideology called Communism. When they realized their mistake and tried to remove that shit, the country fell apart. These handicaps don't apply to China, which is really fucking big, and which successfully implemented capitalism. History is in uncharted waters right now.

EV equity market is hot and will continue to be for a very long time though, right? I'm not sure how increased Chinese tensions affect the major state-run EV manufacturer. The CCP owns NIO, and they want it to succeed and rival the growth and hype of TSLA.

that sounds like a plan for real. I'ma just play DIS for the most part and a few other companies in either the DOW or top of SPY and collect shares using some of the profits whenever I sell on green days as well. Can't let days like this make/break accounts like most happen to people on this sub.

Yeah I think so. You should make money on that in the next run up. But its been basically flat for the past 6 months since it ran up a lot in early part of year. Next run could be in 6 months if can be patient enough to wait for it. But it will definitely run up again.

ITS A RETIREMENT ACCOUNT!
Qs may 50p were selling for 16.50. Couldn't help it, had to sell a couple, bought shares.

Might take years to come back, maybe it won't, dunno. But my cost basis will be 1/4 of the recent high.
They’ve been hit hardest by this pandemic, investor interest kept their stock prices up but without revenue or unprecedented reopening, there’s no way to keep that momentum going into Q1. I expect rotation out of them into large caps, followed by gradual rotation back into them at the end of Q1-2. Best to wait until midday to buy, and stick with household big cap names. Average down on overbought positions. Play it safe, it’s a knife fight out there. Don’t buy the hype, it’s usually people trying to short squeeze out of a position. I think I literally do better when I don’t visit the comments here, wait till trading hours are over to discuss on here and give yourself time and do the research to see if it’s a smart investment.
good one...

I'm looking for more money right now. My autist brain didn't understand. I thought you were retard were just hyping up a meme'ish stock.
how do they buy back more shares then exist? 

Technically impossible without an offering right?

So would GME do an offering for big capital?
Thanks bud!
Its pre-revenue. Like Radio on the Internet

Yea that’s exactly what happened. I’m still learning so my technical language sucks for now.

The contract expires on the 1/8.

So selling it and raising the price per contract is the best option?
Honestly I'm down 71% so I rather see where it goes in the week than sellout now. They are long calls, how could I minimize my losses other than selling right now?

Why is the usps doing such an abysmal job? It's not even packages. I have important bills/employment/healthcare document shit that should've gotten here almost a month ago.
How good is there concentrate and how much a gram?
Why did I give it a PT of 20 bucks when it was around 15 back when it was still a SPAC? I thought it was worth more because of the EV hype at the time, they claimed to have a great battery but weren't going to produce any product until the last 2020's. I've not heard any significant news about it since so I didn't reevaluate it.

If you're worried I should also say I'm wrong about 68% of the time.
also you can sell them back when you're done with the game. Digital copies you can't

The vote for Georgia’s senators was too close and went into a “runoff” election, meaning they’re gonna revote. There’s two senate seats available, and if they both are claimed for the Democrats then it’ll be a blue sweep, which means no more McConnell blocking everything the Dems try to pass
If you truly believe a big rise is imminent why set a stop loss anywhere besides your max tolerance?
Priced in
Continue to watch PLTR slowly go to sub 20
Because it is further above NAV than a typical pre-target acquired SPAC
What’s gonna happen tomorrow?
If you sold today and didn’t buy any dips you are officially the biggest failure of the year. This was so obvious I literally went half all in on spy calls and made more money in 1 day than the best of the gay bears make in ten years. Learn who to listen to in here (bulls) and who not to (bears).

My pltr feb and March 27c and 28c calls are not helping either

What i said was sarcastic, but actually very true. 

What Elon does is impressive. Love him or hate him, but this man know how to build impossible businesses.

Yeah Tesla is way overpriced, but if the market is pricing the future, than he probably is one of the best bets. He constantly does deliver new technology. Now the scale is a different topic, but invention and technology is certainly his strength. 

I dont have Tesla. I just appreciate what he did and ks doing.

I’m holding outs now, but I’m buying in calls in a couple days to capture some of the hype around their event in the next weeks.
Agreed, but it’s been pointed out that even hard copy games take up just as much space. Nonetheless, I’d prefer hard copies of the games I purchase and in case I’ve got to delete one of my games I prefer tangible copies in my library.

Saving people money while being right about it. I can't help myself.
Yeah all those GME subscriptions they offer are pretty useless. Best Buy, used to have a good one called gamers club 20% off all new games for 2 years like $30. Prime briefly did similar discounts on preorders like 5 years ago. Both are discontinued thanks to people like me taking full advantage. Best one I know of now is 5% off with target credit card, I'm always on the look out for better deals especially with next gen games being $70....

????? My man OP posted 1000% gains on SHMP. His account went from $1->$10. He just busted a fat nut over warren buffet and billy spacman. No one cares about the total amount, we only care about yuuuuge percentage gains.
GEX kinda predicted this drop. Sold my puts almost at the bottom today.
No... Its better.

It was up today in premarket and then tanked with the rest of the market. It had a bit of a pullback last week. My bet is today was some classic panic selling. Paper hands. Maybe a bit of jitters about Dems chances too, since it is a close one in a Republican-leaning state.

Each PS5 will be redeemable for one share when the price of the share exceeds $500. Therefore, failure to deliver PS5s due to supply shortages equates to a failure to deliver shares. 

Clearly, this is due to high Christmas demand and it is absolutely GME's fault for being unable to fulfill these orders. Melvin and co are absolutely not doing anything fishy.

Ultimately the goal is to get to 100 TDOC shares and theta gang frokm there. 

At the same time, will keep holding onto ARKG calls and shares and IPOC calls and shares.

I'm sorry for your loss, man. We lost someone in our family way too soon a while back and even going to visit last month was just not as joyous. She was the source of a lot of the joy when she was alive but it's hard to enjoy watching videos of the kids when she's in them because we all miss her so much. 

They say time mends a broken heart but, if we're really lucky, we get like 80 years which just isn't enough. 

It takes some effort, but we can be thankful that we briefly had someone in our lives that meant so much to us that we are capable of missing them for longer than we knew them. 

I hope you and your dad are able to rejuvenate your relationship. Breaking one bond because another was taken from you is a lose lose situation.

It's very tough man. I was very fortunate to be born in a situation where I could get a head start on most people financially, so I am in a good position compared to most my age. With that said, life is still as bleak if not more, than it was 10yrs ago when I was broke with not a dime to my name. Not having people to share your biggest milestones and moments in life makes it all feel so hollow and for nothing.

I bought awhile ago so my NIO calls are all 46, 47, 48
I’ll cry !! 😂🤷🏻‍♀️😭
Make it stop 😭😭😭
I don't think it helped.
I'm assuming you didn't "write" a call, you bought a call option that reached its strike price, and you didn't exercise it. 

1) Exercising an option isn't usually the best option if you're trying to maximize profit, unless it's expiry is soon or it's so deep in-the-money (ITM) that no one would be willing to purchase it.

2) You can always continually make money off of the option, even if its expiry is at 0 days.

3) consider selling the option to another, not exercising it.
Stocks mixed, why, we don’t Fuking know anymore 😎😎😎

I paid them like $8k they called me a few times and I told them I was poor and broke af which was very true at that point. They eventually stopped calling and banned me from using RH again.
I made a split tab view of trading view. Just change the tickers

Long-term equity anticipation securities (LEAPS) are publicly traded options with expiration dates that are longer than one year.

Yo someone update the chat on what the CEO of QS is saying
Buying it up baby
You bought to open? (Bought a call) You have until the expiration date to make money on it. Idk why you would want to exercise an option. Maybe a further explanation of your situation would help
UI kinda sucks but premarket is the best. So unless you really need super early premarket, webull isn't that great.
PLTR bullish. Doing my part
Just use margin

The short answer is yes, the long answer is “Chinese isn’t a race, which means your bigotry is definitely rooted in ignorance.”
Ur gonna get screwed, call both the bank and TDA. What's gonna happen is, TDA will attempt to withdraw multiple times, you're gonna get charged a fee for each attempt from your bank. Depending on your history and the amount, the final attempt may even go through and you might end up with a negative balance.
First I own a position in Apha. But I think a lot of people are way overestimating biden/ even harris view on legal weed.  I don't see us decriminalizing weed in the next year or two. There are a lot of establishment and central democrats that don't want this and will push back. They just tell you these things to get the votes and will bring it back up in 2022 when they need your votes again. The centralists are afraid if they actually win georgia they are going to have to give into all the social programs people have been asking for and they are going to push back. 

I think we will have a big pump if they win Dems but I don't see this happening under biden, maybe in 2022 when biden steps down for "health" reasons maybe harris will be open to do something but I'm not holding my breath.

The company has zero dollars in revenue. Till 2024. I'm gonna get in when it hits the 40s though.
I ended +300, and closer to +400 now that AH kicked in

ICLN LEAPS and (to a lesser extent) ARKK LEAPS salvaged the rest of my shitty red portfolio
That was the shit that happened in dot com and mid 2000’s.  Long story short, don’t ever fuck with the equity in your house to play the market even if you know what you are doing.
Man I remember this one dude pumping the hell out of this stock back in summer. He did a full DD and everything, thanks to him I made $10K. He then got threatened by someone in another subreddit, he straight up deleted everything he ever wrote and then was gone like a fart in the wind. His name was meltworld or meltingawayworld or something with melt and world. Wonder if he has a Lambo by now

no, it's smart
Dkng fucked me hard the last few weeks
He is saying the Div/Yield ratio is 4.60. In all honesty, that's a pretty hefty dividend.

However, the problem is that its 4.60 AFTER the stock itself has dropped 40% since March of 2019.

The yield ratio is high because the price has dropped so significantly.

Could be a sign that it's not a good investment.
Pltr and a slow bleed out. Name a better duo

I have no positions on PSHT, but how does it make sense? OP didn’t say askman is losing money, he said that he’s underperforming the sp500. Why the fuk would anybody start shorting PSHT even if the statement above is correct?

Guessing points lost or %. I had CNBC on in the background and they said that it was but I didn't catch exactly how it was being measured.
I mean it went up 40% because AAPL said iCar to be fair 😂
Was it really that impressive? Crm has been a shit stock to trade
I actually did that not too long ago.   They said they couldn't stop it.  I did a withdraw request and it processed at the same time as the deposit so I had no issues.

Some of the best scenes and plots in the early seasons of The Wire come from the books "homicide: a year on the killing streets" and "the corner", both of which were written by david Simon, who created and wrote The Wire. They're factual accounts from his work as a journalist. The crime scene walk in The Wire is basically a direct screen adaptation of the same scene in "homicide".

No where did I say I will do the correlation. Are you a tactician applying for the position...I’ll take your comments...else...move along. I got no time for shenanigans
Lol I hope u unload it. Shit going back to 515
Where did you see the 5m? Just curious
Is it racist to not download webull because of where it is was made?
[deleted]
Ya the stock price went down from the time I bought calls but they're up like 15% lol. IV crush will be a killer
Up 11% in a month then dumped 6.5% in a week. Seems pretty volatile to me.
Been through this many time and alway come out on top. I’m short the 400 put and that bitch goes up in value while tsla goes up.
I thought that loads of hedge funds have lost money and closed down last year. Why would they move the market against themselves?
I really hate this stock, god damn rocket emojis.
MY BODY IS READY FOR $SLV AT $40 NEXT WEEK

Buy the GME dip
Ban you 🌈🐻
Sold AAPL puts too early this morning, bought the dip at $128 and sold some 135 cc’s for Friday. Not a bad first trading day for 2021.

I hope you see this. I entered into MT b/c of your posts. It's paying off so far. I might add to it in the next few weeks. Appreciate your information.
Didnt sell my 1/15 SQ $120 and TSLA $700 today. Did I fuk up?

Fuckin worst. Bought calls at 25 thinking it was a dip. Nope. New Japan contract??? Yeah let it sink even more
Up at open. Down at 10:15. Up to flat. Waiting for election results.

This wouldn’t impact calls held in RH, would it?
Try sending a dick pics
So pissed I sold my AAPL & CRM leaps this morning. My funds take one day to resettle so I can buy back in tomorrow morning, but did not expect CRM to close like that lol 

I had September 240C’s that I sold and was planning on rolling out to Jan’22 260C’s
Fucking bought 545c at 9:45, it went up crazy without any news. I knew fucking something wrong with it and unload that shit went it hit 4%. Man I feel good at 10:45 when NVDA went down south
Probably last post. I wanted to keep these to the daily thread cuz I don't want to commit to doing these but auto mod kept deleting this comment today as it was too gdamn long apparently.

Since I wrote this already I might as well post it somewhere.

You're talking to dudes pretending to be chicks by the sound of things
Feel like this is the next hertz.

Think it will fail eventually just don't know when, this sub is giving it retard meme strength. Niche brick & mortar is fading & big box stores & amzn usually have same deals or better without all the sales bs corporate makes the clerks say.
First ever option trade — covered call NGA 1/15/21 $30c. Bought at $.25 and sold on the way down at $.55. Underlying was also up 13% on the day. Even though it was only one contract...I can see how this turns into a slippery slope really fast.
Is QS the Best Buy right now? 

Seems like it always pops 25% or more every time that ceo opens his mouth. And he about to go on CNBC again.

HYLN made me a lot of $, so I have a soft spot for them. I hope they moon!
Holy shit this thread is amazing. I can’t help but read these in their voices. Time for a rewatch.
It’s pretty funny the stuff they make up, so the graph can “say” what they want it too. “Oh here is a (insert shape) that’s really bullish”. Like stfu lol
Yep, definitely a winners and losers scenario.

It went up too fast and now people are scared to touch it again after that sell-off on Citron’s tweet. I still believe in that company longterm, not selling (I sold tesla at 600 pre-split, I would be fucking rich if I didn’t). We just need some good news, earnings, announcements of new products and features, it will get there in 3-5 years. My 2025 price target is 250$
so you are saying that in 20-30 years there will be a dip?
Apparently there is a director of porn named Craven Moorehead. Fuck thats a great name.

Great buying day. Bought like mad.
So they're 2 days ahead of the curve? Why didnt Toyota drop 40%?

Stick to things that will boom with a Blue Senate. Like WEED and alternative energy.
Is that SPY? If so its because you can trade SPY 15 mins after close
There’s a couple catalysts coming up. If doesn’t take off by April will likely get out and just ride up EC for a couple QTRs. Fortunately they are shares and not options but with a 20% bleed doesn’t feel much different some times.

Still a gamble on both sides. Weed stocks could get murdered tomorrow.

Seriously wondering if ARKF has a lot of room to run this year. SQ is largest holding at 10% and its had a massive run already. It could go to 300 but what would that translate to for the fund at this point?

I want to message this dumb bitch I hate to find out how much she lost on QS
Because I thought the burden of having to fulfill the contract shifts to me if I sell before expiration. Like I sell this and someone else picks it up and chooses to exercise it on the 15th
No
BA is being run by absolute morons. The 787 has qualify issues. All the shuffling around of their plants and they ended up witch shit products.

Mark my words TSLA will split again when it hits 1000$. That will make the stock psychologically not so overvalued. Papa musk knows that.
1500 ty MT
I did the opposite. Sold my calls for a loss, then bought puts at the bottom. Now they are down 40% with that EOD recovery from AAPL. I am the true 🤡🤡
Lol. I’m in danger. A casual 2k shit away today. Shoutout to FDX
You PLTR pumpers are so late lol. Trend is looking ugly

# $52 weekly put on QS is up 71,400% today. Do what you can with this info
I may purchase some more tomorrow depending on how things go. Sold my stake this morning at ATH to avoid the bleeding flat days Tesla lives oh so much.

I actually bought back first week of December when it crashed at $22 , it ran to $30. Didnt sell because i thought it would break that wall. It didnt. Mistakes were made

Waiting till $20s to buy.

i believe there's a lot of money to be made in this game (short publications) from both sides, you just have to learn who hits how hard, learn any patterns in the stock reaction, etc

some of these dudes hit really hard and i would never consider going against them (like quintessential who publishes about twice a year), muddy waters, maybe blue orca (who i think does mostly asia listed stuff), others are probably are often a great fade, i don't have an easy answer for you, but if you are bored and looking for an edge, this part of the game is definitely worth learning

do not buy options with money you are not willing to lose, because eventually you WILL lose out big on options, it's just too volatile

Seriously dude lol I’ve been wanting to short it so bad
Pour one out for the QS holders. What happened there
Dem sweep is bullish GameStop too, more stimmy bux for PS5’s.
Seriously though I wouldn’t bet against Cohen showing his schlong again with another 13D soon.
I hope they do but never get hopes up. dumbest outcome would be a split. I bet warnock win and oosof doesn't. screenshot this and send me FUCKIN respect
You aren’t even in the right thread retard
I cut it loose today, which means it will probably get some big gains sometime over the next week or so.
Honestly happy with PLTR since it only stuck the tip in my ass instead of a full on bloody slam
Hey now, I bought a PS5 with my GME gains. But yeah, you're not wrong.

Well hopefully there is a bounce in the AM

Shhh I'll give you ternion dick
One of the most difficult things about losing a sibling is having to see your parents never truly the same. I lost my only sibling about a decade ago now, and life has never really been the same. Shit's tough. My relationship with my dad has fallen off a cliff since and I  can't even blame the guy. I know he always preferred my sister to myself and losing her really hurt him. He just closed off and became a really angry person, who doesn't take joy in anything. It's tough. Being a son you wanna see your dad proud of you and happy, but no matter what I do, it's just never enough. Life is so humbling man. I know we wanna get rich, but life without the people you love the most just ain't the same.
actually my first time getting in.
The pepper and garlic butter are the only reasons to order papa johns.
Lmfao if you actually believed in GameStop you probably haven’t set foot in GameStop in like 10 years.  The place is nothing more than a 2010 remnant.
It's basically a ponzi scheme, and most of the initial investors have cut and run
Continue 💎👐🏻 for GME. Wish I hadn't already YOLO'd here, because this would be an even better time to get in. But nbd.
Shit turned to a boomer stock.
So you’re saying I did good

Honestly a day like this isn’t bad. A solid premarket pump is much better than starting the day down 1 percent

Reading up on the DD... im not a long termer.  But the volume had picked up a ton also.  So I said fuck it.  Thought it would be a one or two day pump.... for maybe 100% return.  Man was i wrong.

no one is selling GME shares, so no one is retarded enough to have loss porn.  
Everyone is waiting for Cohen to file a form4 and hostile takeover GME
Not the day I expected, but I did pretty well. 😎
I did but I fuckin sold at open. FUCK ME
Bought the spy bottom, still holding, asshole will pucker by open tomorrow.
Good job hanging in there MT. Im proud of you buddy
Im literally so retarded I sold nio calls when it was near its lows and chased spy puts. Like im so fucking retatrded it doesnt make sense
Huh

Good choice brother. I've been buying into it since last year. One of my favs given the higher TSLA exposure.
Then don’t buy weeklies?

Would’ve bought the QS dip if it were only 10% but when I saw 30% I said fuk that
Shorts are really taking it to us right now.
Amd beat both the market and tech. MM rotated out of AMD in both categories last 2 weeks. The waters are a bit choppy is all, nothing to worry about.
not sure how long it's going to take but MRK looks disrespected.  They should get back to pre-pandemic price for sure.  Being kept low because they screwed up their vaccine response?  Tempting MRK leaps.
A steel helmet.
BNGO is over 1 billion market cap. Anybody else make any money on that today? 

I only made like 600 bucks but a +90% trade was nice on a day when everything else is down

That theta had me sweating a bit, but today brought us big gains. Was able to sell my 1/29 $23 call for a profit to dip into some $QQQJ refueling, and u/vitocorlene has returned. Steel daddy bringing us that steel handed money train on a railroad to mars 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Up $9400 to start 2021. Ty NIO.

I did the same with PLTR. I just rest easy knowing my GME shares will recover. Even if I have had the displeasure of watching them bleed off $3.6 over the last week.
i think gme killed everyone shareholder
He's probably just some "nerd" hit a jackpot with chewy and now wants to be all gamer dude reminiscing about the golden days of consoles/PC's in store experience. It's a losing long term battle

Hypothetically speaking, if you had 30000 dollars to yolo into January 2022 options for one company, which would you choose?
Dude we've seen GME bounce around like this for weeks. Doesn't even affect us anymore.
Really fucked up spread. Meant to buy cheap zoom debit spread but did bear call spread instead. Had to buy debit spread even further out of the money just in case it pumps premarket. On top on that closing the spread will be a bitch for a decent fill.
Jack ma died last year buddy.
Shares unlock tomm
those are worthless, metals are where it's at
I’ll jump back in on BABA once they announce Jack is dead from a heart attack or COVID or some bullshit story.

Made no trades today, planning the same tomorrow
Especially from the QS bag holders.
When you gonna learn your lesson about pltr calls?

If there's one thing I've learned in my year here, it's "Don't bet against Elon". Seriously, it should be in the sidebar.
You lost 20% on a trade, so you stuck it into a different trade to double your loss? Mods, this guy right here.
I just did my first trade listening to wsb, so I damn better hope you are right 🚀

I bought 1/15 $20puts before xmas, just cashed those out and switched to calls when gme hit $17.50 as I think it has bottomed out for the short term.

because the 1984 quoting retards are out in full force. I have no chance against u guys so I surrender. Cancel me and downvote me to oblivion, Mr. Retardsky
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀ALL IN PLTR 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
This company was the reason I didn't bleed today. 😎
I need TTD and ROKU to pamp the fuck up
Steel portfolio got me a 13% gain today 🚀🚀🚀
How do you plan on earning that 60 bucks back?
We need this to bleed down more to give some room to make a million
this aint financial advice. These are just my thoughts. You can do whatever you want with it

So you’re saying it’s underpriced
Chinese zodiac signs, look it up
Lol bruh I made a post about my experience and got downvoted to hell.
Nothing is stocked ever.. employees urged to push used items.
Finished green today, not sure how but I’ll take it.
Have yet to break even for my April and June calls but I trust you😂
I don't think that's a compliment
How the fuck were you able to sell? The market was so unstable this morning.

I couldn't sell shit.
PLTR pleas fly again :(
Hope it’s flat tomorrow
Hang in there my dude. Poor choice of words perhaps..
Double the virus double the stimulus pump
ZM hitting 500 EOM

Sorry but how is the MM doing something?
The fact that TLS dipped 11% in the morning for no reason and then ended the day green is low key hilarious. Just wish I bought the dip 🤦‍♂️
How was XLE the green sector today 😑
Okay cool - 4PM. Now I will log out of my WFH stuff. I will now contemplate how useless I was during WFH hours today. Now I'll promise myself to work harder until 8AM. Then I will do the absolute minimum and then read about stocks/options all day.
Hold spy calls overnight yea or nay?
Going to wake up at 4 am and work furiously on GME memes.
Also went down the slide today, but we we will recover and add some.
Heads up for this volatile month and you can do it
Praying that Portnoy can raise as much funds for PENN that he did for his barstool funds. 🙏
Says the retard who thinks the market was drilling all day from an announcement 2 hours ago. 🤣🤣🤣🤣🤡🤡
ALWAYS BEEN A LONGTERM PLAY PAPERHANDED FOOL
i'm even on the day but down huge on BIGCock and it's not good for my psyche. thing is getting destroyed. getting no love at a higher valuation like other tech stocks and is gonna keep going down. fuck fuck fuck
That bat fucker will be found dead from a tragic accident performing some kind of task/venture/project/etc... that shows how much of a great and prosperous nation CCP is.
EXPC
How much lower will FDX go? Bleeding for a month time to close these puts?
the good thing is that when the dow "tanks" that means 1.7%...
whwn it rallies its +6/10%
My moves for tomorrow is to pray that GME doesn't buttfuck me again
Anyone still remembers the Hertz bankruptcy pump 🤡
The bleed is getting pretty familiar at this point.

I'm down $75k and still not selling my shares.   
I can wait 6 months for Cohen to pull the fucking rug.
Super extra long game. When one of the steps is to make the business you're investing in unsustainable in your own country, you're playing 9D chess
It's the motion of the ocean, bro

There are loads of CRMs, but they have *the* CRM ticker and are the leader in the field. 

Most investors know what they're actually buying, so I understand your confusion.

Man, I hate when I dicule something and then gotta go back and dicule it all over again....

I realized im incredibly bad at this so I put half my money in a vanguard mutual fund eod. Now i’m a bad investor and gay.

That's completely okay, their are many economic models and non are 100% correct including mine. Most of it is speculation. Only time will tell

I guess I'll be holding onto PLTR for a while...

Gonna be 31 Friday when Dems win Georgia.
lmao it's honestly stupid how well this has held up
What can Palantir show that will wow investor. It is a machine learning consultancy company that competes in a space that the big tech companies don't care about because it is consulting.
Demo day will tank the stock, not boost it.
QS ceo on CNBC to talk about getting anally wrecked today
solar & hedge (UVXY) saved me today, $TAN/$RUN.  Lets go Georgia don't screw this up we need sane senators
+15% today. Bought NIO last week and MRNA this morning
Was up 31%, ended day at +18% sooo still a positive (as long as we're looking daily/weekly)
Does this spell the end of WSB?
PLTR + TSLA = 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

That is all.
He snagged your mom.
Lmao no retard
Market imbalance of $3B to the buy side. With the GA vote, no idea if this means another red day, or the market will go green tomorrow.

PLTR you are such a fucking disappointment. I cant even look at you, get out of my fucking sight you pathetic garbage, git!
well done.
I did my part. Added shares and July calls today. 

Sold some NEM so I still have some firepower if they keep drilling it.

Going all in on a new Cohen share increase.

down -10% on my GME shares for the day. could be worse, -10% is but a fraction of +150%
If I learned one thing today, it is that congress should pass the $2000 stimulus check bill. Because you retards are proof that the money will end up right back in the banks.
If ARKG isn't green tomorrow I'm gonna have to intervene.
Still fighting for my fucking life
QS CEO on CNBC soon

PLTR closed less than -1%. I'll chalk it up as a win

Was up 31% early, ended up 18% 

C'mon MT fly!
my thoughts exactly. although there is still room to drop. but I am glad it bounced so hard at 22.5
Just watched this since a long time the other night. Great flick.
And unfortunately you’re not allowed to talk about it for a rule number that I do not remember forbids it lol 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Thanks, man. I need that kind of positivity in my life. I nearly lost my 100k porfolio and just managed to bring it back up to 55k. I hate myself for swinging from $TSLA to $CRSP. I'll bring it back. I'm diamond handing $CRSP weeklies and monthlies. I also snagged some $PLTR leaps. We'll see what this year has in store for me. Good luck to you, brother.
QS mooning AH 🤡🤡
Today was insane. Up 9.5k - 4k - 8.5k - 1.5k- finished up 7.5k. Thanks NIO. But for real why do I do this to myself LMAO

you mean metals
Remember to post your losses. Seeing barely any posts the last few days == big LIES especially after today, you know who you are, chop chop
I mean when they see that it would immediately get them $2000 checks? Otherwise total gridlock for 2 years? I could see more than I thought a month ago.

But yes, that is possible and what needs to happen for Republicans to win. But it isnt a guarantee which is why I think it's going to be close.

This is the right idea but I would come back end of year like in December. SQ will probably be like 300, you would be up big, and your contracts would still have a lot of time left on them. Then you just sell out and collect your 10 bagger. Waiting till Jan 1, 2023 exposes to you having almost no time to adjust if you come back after we crashed bcus we had the most amazing raging bull market from 2020-2022 and you werent checking your 10bagger sitting there that withered down to nothing
Yes
i held aapl calls for weeks. 

today i switched to puts. 

so expect it to moon tmr.

Got it.
not GME-gang but this made me actually look... holy fuck, the **short % of float** on GME is **250%**?!

for reference, other meme "hype" stocks TSLA and MRNA are both about 6-8%.

bluechip merck is 0.5%

are the shorts levered to the tits on the GME position or what is happening?!
They have multiple revenue streams, the "bang bus" aka LV lease program is just one of them.

Buying BABA is a trap anyways. Shell company incorporated in the Cayman Islands. Investors not entitled to ownership in company, they just receive a portion of profits. The plug can be pulled on the western investors at any time and their shares made worthless. It may be on the NYSE but it’s not an American company with legal checks and balances. 

That’s what happens when you trust the CCP with your money. It’s a whole different ballgame than buying truly American stocks.

At their last battery day they announced they want to mine their own lithium and are charging their cell designs to be more efficient.  They have manufacturing partnerships but are not just licensees of someone else’s tech. 

Designing and building cars is an expensive pain in the ass as is updating the physical designs which Tesla hasn’t really done.  That’s why the only car makers with double digit profit margins are luxury car makers. Everything else is specialized technology for a commodity marketplace.  Much easier to profitably scale and build batteries for bulk sale.

I got in during the dip, so my cost basis for those calls is lesser than yours, but am wondering if you had any opinions on this dip, and/or if we should average down.

Hearing a lot of negativity on Stocktwits so am nervous too.

Thanks a lot for sharing your plays, you made me a lot of money on ZM too!

What do you mean? Today was a day to offload your short positions and go long. I LOVE -2% days. At any given time I’m about 20% short on company’s that I don’t believe in and 80% long on the whole market. Today I averaged down on my longs and sold my shorts on Boeing and Ford.
PLTR jumped 5% this morning while SPY tanked 2.5%, then dropped 3 points while SPY recovered. What even is this stock lol
Maybe buy shares and sell covered calls then

Personally think BCS has better character development. Breaking Bad loses some appeal on rewatch because so much of the magic is based off suspense/unknown, but imo is not as high quality with character dev as BCS (or sopranos or the wire). Just my 2 cents. Still a great show.
Yes sure, and my father is Bill Ackman.
Who bought the 1/15 $60s I sold on NIO? May we both gain tendies.
They fucked me many times
I would be happier if it rallied within a few months, but I don't have a tight timeline for this money - if it takes a couple years to hit redemption I'm okay with that.  The only wrench is if the market gets wrecked soon and takes this and everything else with it, that would severely extend any recovery timeline.
Just got some 1/15 20c at discounted price
Were any of you retards old enough to remember if AMZN or aapl were like TSLA too when they were growing? Did they have hockey stick like formations?

The last time CRSR pulled back, it fell down to as low as $33.26 per share. That’s close to current price. I would buy between 34 - current price but CRSR can easily rebound when the rest of the market rebounds and it may never reach this price level because we are only weeks away from 2/11 earnings date. They are gonna smash the numbers. They revised their outlook upwards twice since the last earnings call
Because only Trumpers are in GME gang?!?

Salesforce would be a better performing stock 100% if their ticker wasn't something obscure like 'CRM'. Like wtf, when I search for 'aapl' or 'amzn' their stock is the first result I get, but when I search for 'crm' I get a load of useless information.

Lol nice, first one's free. In the future though, this was an absolutely moronic bet that you got super lucky on.

If you're YOLOing in all you've got, do it on options that are closer to the current stock price, and expire further in the future. Also don't hold through big events like earnings, or NIO day. Sell on or before the event. IV almost always drops after and destroys option value (refered to as IV crush).

The barriers to entry for selling hardware are low and therefore so are the margins. I think they’ll have to do something more. I’m not saying they won’t, but comparing Chewy to GME isn’t really a compelling thesis.

Yes I averaged down more today. And yes if you’re only wanting to play earnings then earlier calls make sense. I mostly have Jan 29s but also now have Feb 5s in addition to the Feb 19s. At the time I loaded up awhile back there were no feb 5s, only Jan 29s and Feb 19s.
Pls make it stop
Absolutely. I loved El Camino. Jesse deserved all the happiness in the world. Even though he did a lot of bad shit it was always under manipulation from Walt. I think he repented plenty for that during his time with Tod. I was so glad we got confirmation of a happy ending. I also really appreciated him getting to say goodbye to Pete and Brandon.

More than that for you considering everything is down. Good for you.

Wait for the ER for whatever stock you got. Many steel stocks report this month or next. MT’s ER is Feb 11 so hold on till then.
Tough choice. On the one hand they're overvalued by every metric invented in the history of corporate finance. On the other hand the stock keeps going up.

just dropped again
The 'turnout is down' narrative you're following is flawed. Yes, it's down, but whats in so far is more democrat than it was in the general.

So Republicans either need to come out just as strong tomorrow as in the general, or improve their margins. It's going to be close.
several companies have brought lawsuit against short activists, probably a couple of these were successful, but overall it's not illegal to put together a research report and trade in front of it, assuming the information in the report doesn't contain any "material non-public information"

many of the top short sellers have lawyers go through each sentence prior to publishing their report, if everything they say can be proven to be true (or reasonably believed to be true), and wording that they used was appropriate than they are good to go

the disclosures they include in the publications are also well thought out and designed to protect the research publisher, this was an amazing business back in the china reverse merger mania days, but got a bit more difficult with 2020 being one of the most difficult years to publish short reports, they are forced to be really selective, raise the bar on the quality of the report and be satisfied with smaller profits

It's the buhrd feeedahh.
Man WSB isn’t aligned at all right now nor has been for the last month or so.

Usually you’d consistently see a couple tickers, then finally one that’s just being spammed. Everyone saying “free money” next day “imagine not buying....” next day “still mooning MF’s” next day top post is someone’s fd’s bought a year ago making 20,000% games forcing even more fomo from the real degenerates

Now it’s fucken chaos. All questions, all skeptical, all idiocy
Oh yeah you're correct. It has been sometime that I've seen it. Either way. Walter would know not to use a rental truck with gps. Those two idiots he hired wouldn't have known either, Huell and Bill Burr.

BB takes place 08 to 2010/2011. 

The cartel knows about Heisenberg. It seems the legend of Heisenberg has been passed around as ruthlessly taking out people but he has no juice. And the cartels would take him out simply because of territory and the need for his product. Simple as that.
I just lurk and enjoy memes cos this is the last part of the Internet where people can still have a laugh
I'm willing to admit I was wrong, but I certainly hope OP understands he got crazy lucky that it jumped up 10% today.

I was too scared to look but OPEN LFG!!!
Did you average down more today? From earninwhisper it estimated Apple ER will be on 1/28 so with your Feb 18 calls, won't that be way to far in premium to pay if you just want to play earning?
ARCT $53 EOD, tomorrow
Kinky and suicidal are such a beautiful ying and yang ❤️
Best message I saw today “and suddenly a collective amount of GUH’s could be heard across the world after PLTR open”
Why don’t we all just go all in on TSLA?

just got a 10% raise for this year. that means I get to gamble 10% more
QS, gonna have a gnarly oversold bounce soon enough
[removed]
A vote is months down the road. This is r/wallstreetbets. Shouldn't hold until the actual vote.
I like it. /ES bounced right at it's weekly expected move \~3655. These bounds are pretty strong unless you're really dumping or running. It's followed it to a tee the last several weeks. There's also \~11-12M shares of SPY purchased around that bottom. Sticking to the plan and getting long with a close above 3690 that we'll see 3800 this month 🤞
How will Xi Jinping ever recover???

Spy battles for 370 are actually very exciting. Doesnt matter if its support or resistance, this people are fighting for real. 

Well people and algos
That’s awesome! I got it for $5 today, and pretty happy. Making some decent earnings today. Just wish I would of bought more, and didn’t have money caught up in PLTR.
Right there with you, bought right at open this morning @ $19 too. In Cohen we trust or whatever 🚀🚀🚀
Yeah it is a bit different over there though. You've got a very small island with a new variation that is 70% more contagious. They figure if they lock it down now, they can get on top of everything by rolling out the vaccine
Could we start a GoFundMe to find Jack Ma? If we raise enough money, we could probably get PLTR to help out
What's happening on the eleventh?
I need a play with ticker, and strike date and price.
Did this plot bit ever have closure? Did it moon? Just watched the whole series too and can't remember.

Am I reading this right

[https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ABNB](https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=ABNB)

ABNB has 100M share float, but 600M shares outstanding

So >80% of its shares are locked up.

So when lockup expires, there's going to be a HUGE amount of new shares on the market?
🌈🐻
Or you could sell and buy something that isn’t shit
In for April 27 C

Ehhh I don’t really see the upside. I haven’t done a lot of research on them though so I could be missing something, but the chart doesn’t look too appetizing
Brooo! Same! But that’s just my PLTR feb calls lol add the leaps and others tanking and today is a big oof
lock me down and stimulate me. daddy like
U probably should
WHOOSH
lol
CRSR definitely. DKNG May experience near term volatility due to COVID news. Example - whether baseball season will start on time or not because the owners want to delay the start after the fans are vaccinated enough to attend games
Agreed.

There are no filler episodes at all in The Wire.

PDYPY may be a better buy for sports betting. CRSR I think is always a great time before their first ER on Feb 8th.
In some languages like Dutch, the ‘s is used for plural in some words. This might be the case in more languages. 

His native language might just be English.
**DID YOU BTFD SON?**
Glad I’m not alone in the early penny days. Every day since last week I’ve been like “wow another 80% no way this will last” and every day it moons another $1/share. Pump is wild but good on you for still getting some real tendies off it

Yea. I think gamestop is annoying but I'm not going to wallmart for a game purchase ffs.

BIG green tomorrow.
Not to most who watched it.

I just saw him as a guy who was breaking three law to overcome life giving him a raw deal.  It wasn't until a couple seasons in that he was the villian.

I don't see breaking the law to sell drugs as a singular thing that makes someone evil though.

honestly don't know wtf that means
“Oh we don’t just play the stock market, we win!”

When I first started buying stocks I’d always think of this scene carmella buying stocks for some reason.
Ok sure. SPY will be > 364
For me it's not "theoretically".
probably.... and im a bull... hope to god no though.
There’s a lot to gain financially in both taxation and for the marijuana lobbyists that are garnering lots of favor with politicians. Weed will be legal very soon. The bill already passed the house and if there is a blue senate it will pass and probably quickly. Follow the money.

You should watch them whole series.

The big one for me is when he's trying to build a setup and uses a "pringles can"  antenna and goes to Microcenter to buy an msi laptop vs the typical best buy /apple bs you see everywhere.

There's also a whole dark web market subplot that is really on point.  

Yes, some of it is still cyberpunk-y, but you should gives it a go.

I put it on par with "Halt and Catch Fire"  for internet accuracy.

Why did 4 different PLTR memes drop at once, to the minute.... all from different profiles?

If they would held they would have been in profit by now. Paper bags, this is why I said long term play and no calls because IV is too high

Emotionally?

No there isn't.  But don't ask that question to reddit.  Overrun with lefty retards that don't care there blind hope isn't going to change reality.  Repubs will remain in control.  Bullish on oil in 21.  Bearish on weed at least the first half.

Today we found out that it was Jack Ma who was keeping this market propped up all along. Markets will be red until we find him alive and well.
Just sold pltr today at a 2% profit. So expect it to sky rocket and I will rebuy at $28. It will be glorious
Sell the news
QS, go back down you cuck
does that toast have butter on it
Excited for liftoff tomorrow
It’s a good company for many of the same reasons as TLRY. The reason I like TLRY more is because it benefited more from the merger with APHA. APHA lost the cash from the money it spent in the acquisition, and they paid a nice premium. TLRY receives this cash, keeps its assets, and gains the assets of APHA under the merger.

Tomorrow never dies
I am invested in both thru options and shares. GME is definitely the move between the two. GME is valued at 1 billion in a market where anything that moves is valued at 10 billion or more. SNAP is near 100 billion. PLTR is valued at like 45 billion despite doing 1 billion in sales.
Another red day for PLTR ❤️
Big fan of salsa
Big errors here. I don’t see TSLA, PLTR, GME, or BABA.
It was an accounting error they actually sold 2,000,000 cars don't sweat it.
Yes
it does look like they upped their shares in 2020. according to 2019 they had about $11million invested and judging by the price ~11 dollars that means they had about 1million shares in 2019. They added 800k shares in 2020 if that chart is updated to 2020.
Look at these suckers trying to guess the bottom of this correction. You're going to learn this month bulls, you're going to learn.

A lot of your price targets seem to totally ignore the large amounts of share dilution that occurred in 2020. From memory there are like 2x as many CCL shares than pre COVID. The idea that is will hit $40 this year seems unlikely since the pre COVID price accounting for the dilution is only like $30.

Bngo anyone???
if it's currently at 19 and your call is for 24, it only has to make 26% to reach you strike price. You have more than 3 months for it to do so. $MT went up 28% in the month of December ALONE. If it keeps up this momentum it'll be over $40 in March. I'm not sure what you paid for the option, but that's about 1,000% profit, purely on intrinsic value.

My plan is, about halfway through the options period, compare what I could make selling it at maximum volatility versus if I were to sell it near the end of the expiration period. A lot will have to do with the velocity of steel price increases.

I'm mostly joking. TSLA does seem to be risking its reputation by churning cars out the factory as fast as they can just to beat numbers, regardless of quality. 

Even we are objective about, though, shorting TSLA back when they were on the edge of bankruptcy was the rational thing to do, as that was the most probable outcome (Musk will admit that without any problems, as he knows he was fighting the odds).

Can I call my broker and cancel a sell order that went through a month ago? I need my BNGO shares back.
Unlike the past sell offs, there isn't even a theme to this sell off (travel, work from home...etc). Everything is selling across the board like June 11th.
They’ve saved me so many times
Possible for BNGO to go up AH??

Are the people that you are arguing with living in Q2 of 2018? It's been profitable for 7 of the last 9 quarters.
PSTH is the best value for a target company out there.  They will get a better target at a better price because of their SPAC structure and investor roll than anyone else out there right now.

That is the play.

Also, I’m up $1.2M on PSTH right now.  I’ll be up an additional $3.1M if it closes above $30 at March expiry.
Lmao
How do you feel about that now...

Yea but I buy at the top 🤡
I didn't like it.  I would have rather they had gone an xfiles route and the work killer turned out to be some sort of demon.

I love the stand alone episodes of xfiles (Ice and the incest hillbilly one still stand out in my mind decades later).  The overall series story arc fell flat for me.

PLTR is very low as you can see. But it may remain low for some bit. But it will eventually go back to normal 26-30 I think. It’s just instant gratification vs playing a long game now. If buying stocks, it’ll go back up eventually. I wouldn’t buy anything that expires. Too uncertain what the price will be.

Hmm that must explain why democratic administrations always outperform Republican ones. All those scary regulations and taxes you speak of sure did make the markets tank during the Clinton and Obama administrations.

He didn't know Jesse was working with the DEA lol, he didn't know until after he gets to his money and Hank/Gomez are there. He only knew that Jesse changed his mind about burning his house down. It was only revealed to the audience that Hank is why. Jesse always made him act emotionally and irrationally, like running down the dealers. Makes no sense and he should've let Jesse die in a shootout but he cares about him in his own weird way and it was always his downfall. This scene is a good example. He could've killed Jesse like 3 separate times prior to this but he considers him family and was therefore off limits. 

Also, drone? Breaking bad takes place in 2008-2009. I mean military UAVs existed back then but that's kind of a stretch to write into a show where they are still using flip phones.

Again Walt has no issue with the Cartel. Gus killed the Cartel members, not Walt. Walt only killed Gus and no one knew it was him, so I still don't see why you think he's a target of theirs?

“Bagholding” is a term for a reason
I think you just want to do it. Don't lie.
Dems plans for big tech breakup is more significant compared to GOP. You've given a good line you've heard from elsewhere, but the reality is breaking up big tech in some form is bipartisan. How far they go will depend on whether Congress is split or pure Dem.
BBBY is perfect for a straddle (I personally am long). If they even survive earnings, they will moon, but otherwise, they will take a hit. Premiums are decent for me so I'm loading up on jan 15 eod and some march calls.

Over 4 years, definitely. For 2021, not guaranteed
What your saying doesn’t add up.

The screen shot above says that they are holding 1811792 shares now.
If they have been reducing their position over the last few years they must have had more.

Yet you said in 2013 the GME holding was $51 million.
2013 share prize was $50+ multiple by 1811792 = $90,589,600.

Your figures just don’t add up
Na pause that
Stop buying based on the delusion that travel will return to normal. Bet against the cruise and airlines - if they go under, nothing of value will have been lost. (On the bright side, we might see a new innovative business model replace it.) And don't bet that the gov't will continue to keep giving them money - the population is becoming more aware of the games being played and they are not happy about it.   
No $2000 for you, me or anybody else, but 25 billion in April,15 billion in December for the airlines.

ngl, I just bought into PLTR. looking good at this price imo
If GME actually squeezes, I think you'll see retail investors getting a lot more credence. 

Conceivably, retail investors are much stronger than funds. But retail investors rarely ever coordinate on a large scale. This sub helps with some of that. It doesn't mean we are going to be able to manipulate the market as much as larger investment firms, but we can make waves to get attention (and already have).
Kind of. The people complaining saying we should lockdown are out doing warehouse raves etc.

nah, something doesnt feel right. gotta let markets settle the next few days esp with this runoff

Officially in the red all time. Fuck QS, NET, and airlines
BAN!
Ehh that would be a rocky economic start especially with a rep senate, less likely to pass stimmy to help small business and poors, Dem senate still probably won't that much either but who knows. 

Without direct stimmy to working class and businesses, a nationwide lockdown would finish off so many people already on the edge of financial ruin.
I haven't realized yet

I believe the last sentence of Vito's post was a "coded" message about what the play is in regards to this post.
I can agree with you on several points, especially that the market will be giddy with legalization at the state level, especially in NY. However, if you investigate the proposed legislation in NY, it is specifically designed to prevent already large companies from swooping in and completely occupying the industry vertical (with the exception of a handful of master licenses that can go to pre-existing medical grow ops in the state, which TLRY does not have). 

I would imagine they would come in under cultivator and processor licenses, which are allowed to coexist with one company, with limitations. This will be short-term money-losing, but long term definitely bullish. I agree TLRY is primed to be a long term winner, but I don't believe 2021 is the year. 

PS, if you're interested in discussing the NY legislation (and who stands to benefit), this is literally what I do for a living, and changes I've publicly recommended have been incorporated into the revised bill.

It could be a dank plan, but I see RC partnering up with institutional shareholders from the US. There's already been meetings amongst them and RC last year. W/ RC's multiple, hostile takeover/proxy war lawyers on payroll, he has backup plans in placed for whatever situation, I'm sure. RC has plenty of rich buddies here in the states that can invest, and he doesn't need to hit up Norway but he very well could still doe.

For those confused. Georgia is voting tomorrow for their senator and the market is worried it would be democratic because than we would have a democratic majority in congress, Senate, and presidency. Which is a big no no for corporations. They want a Republican majority in Senate that way nothing gets done and nothing changes for the next 4 years so their models will look cleaner

He knew Jesse was working with the DEA and somehow he believes it? He doesn't ponder getting a drone or hiring a driver? Easily could have been avoided. He can build a fucking remote controlled machine gun that ejects from a car trunk, all meanwhile placing the gun in a perfect angle and height? But he will take a junkies word and fly aimlessly into the desert. Miles and miles away while Jesse says he's burning however many barrels per whatever time. I would have simply asked ok, how many barrels are there Jesse? 

Even more importantly someone as intellectual as WW wouldn't ever ever ever admit to breaking laws knowing his brother in law who is DEA and Knowingly trying to prosecute him, on the phone. 

And mexican cartel bosses have like 30 kids dude. Once they get wind that some middle aged white guy with absolutely NO juice in the middle of New Mexico had everything to do with it. He is a dead man. They would have burned him alive in his car with all his children like some recent guy in Chicago who tried to fuck the cartels over. Cartels don't play or give two fucks. Nothing is business. It's all personal.

That’s a good strategy to go from 50% losses to 75%.

Ask yourself a question: knowing what you know today, would you buy your options for what they are currently valued? If the answer is no, take your loss and sell, live to fight another day.

Judging by the price action and the graph shown on the website, I believe the stake went down steadily not the value. I think they have like a set threshold of number of shares according to how much money they have in the stock.

My 2 cents: stay bullish, but iv is so high the money is in selling options, so sell puts at least 3 months out. I'm using the proceeds to buy shares so I have a long term accumulation and dont get left out when meme stocks moon.

That will not amount to anything good. Placing the whole country under embargo will do more than what you're speaking of. If they can't do trade with western countries they can't make money which means they can't do shit. A war will ruin multiple countries.
Im confused now. If the market is selling because things are overcooked, why is tesla up 3%?  Just thought about that. Even with the delivery beat, if there were valuation concerns, Tesla would not be up that much with that beat.

I bought at $5 this morning. So far making some money. Enough to average out my PLTR issues, plus some gains. I’m glad I grabbed it at $5! Seems it’s gonna stay around that 6.50 average today. Hopefully hits 7 after hrs. Then goes up to $11 over the next week or two from there. They have a lot lined up! Do some research. This may go from a cheap stock, to a proper. So good to get in early!

I appreciated the explanations for what happened while he was with Tod but I don't think it was a loose end without it.

I was actually doing pretty good with AMD, PLTR, NET calls 2 months ago but I held onto them too long and all the gains evaporated. My retarded fault for not selling. I also had a bunch of small calls on stocks are that were being talked about on this sub but they never went up. So a bunch of -$100 to -$500 hurt my portfolio really hard.

VRTX and CRISPR are co-developing a treatments for sickle cell anemia and beta-thalassemia using CRISPR based ex-vivo gene editing treatment. They're in phase 1/2 and recently presented promising results from human patients. Ex-vivo means they're taking cells, editing them outside the body, and then transplanting them back into the patient. EDIT is working on both of these diseases too, but they're a few steps behind. 

EDIT's in-vivo approach for treatment of congenital blindness and hearing loss are both super interesting, but the transition from successfully editing cells in a petri dish to injecting something into a living patient and seeing the same result is a big step forward. Again, not a bad investment necessarily, but doesn't hurt to spread out your bets if you're interested in investing in the CRISPR space, as CRISPR and VRTX are pretty far ahead on two of the more lucrative applications for CRISPR and VRTX and have a lot more collective experience bringing results into real human patients. 

Cheers and good luck!
Lol shows your true colors now does it? I am a “nagger” (how you see it) I simply was referring to actual naggers because you guys nag about losses all of the time, racist.

From what I know since mid 2020, Azure is fronting a lot of the costs to migrate by basically handling a lot of the heavy lifting and shifting for enterprise customers. 

On top of that, large corporations are becoming more and more wary of AWS and having all of their systems living on a single provider.

At worst Azure is stealing some market share purely because AWS tends to have large outages here and there.

I had 40k in 01/15 55c that I got out of at the perfect time. Soooooooo thankful for that. Those calls are basically worthless right now. I was looking at DKNG's chart closely and just loved the entire setup going into last week. To me it looked primed for a breakout to ATH. Algos selling off last week in anticipation of the lockup of shares today is what I believe has screwed that whole thing up. At this point, hoping DKNG can do something once it hits the mid 50s, if not, I'm out for good. The opportunity cost alone makes bag holding excruciatingly painful for myself. I need to trade, and not having that ability just blows.

You’re right to be concerned.  Even if they were outsourcing they would still want to have on staff and martech type VP who would oversee the progresss.

I’m in 11k at 0.78 thanks to a tip here and put in another 100 at $1 when I saw it was pumping. I’d have put in more but I wanted to stay decently liquid over the long weekends. I sold at 6.90 today.

I basically took profits at my speculation of half maybe ($14), a really speculative play. I tried doing further DD about the FDA approval and without that they can only be research devices and not mass produced. So say that it’s on par with PACB, but they spend way more on marketing than research and I’m not sure whether their installation numbers will be better after COVID or during. I see a bunch of in progress studies for research purposes of the device but the only reference I could find to in progress FDA approval for clinical was a comment on seeking alpha. Not even in the shareholder transcripts.

Their new business model holds some promise instead of buying the machines outright but you should proceed with caution. This is a limited market. Don’t FOMO with money that you don’t have.

It’s separate from Rolls-Royce the car, which is now owned by BMW. Rolls-Royce makes airplane engines and some other energy equipment. They also have significant defense contracts in the UK and US. They get a lot of their revenue from regular service of their commercial engines. Bit of a longer term play, but once travel picks up, they will recover. Shares have been diluted significantly this year so temper your expectations of upside when you look at their chart.

2 months? You can easily do that with ATM spreads. Double or nothing in a week, not going to get a decent sized portfolio without some serious risk when starting out at $150. Also, gains need to be $2,500+...
Last week I deposited $50k into my Robin Hood account but I just put it back into my bank account without touching a dime. I'm not touching this shit. I already know how it's gonna end.

China doesn't need to be contained. It needs to be put down. Their government has grown far to evil to be left alone. Their leaders need to be hanged. Not corralled.
Huh? Aren't these puts? If TSLA is going up how are making gains.
From the other thread with the exact same theory on ACB:

You will lose all your money, unless the market at large shares your misunderstanding.

The biggest promise Biden/Harris made was to try and decriminalize marijuana in the US. This is not the same as legalization. It means you won't be charged with a crime for small amounts. There is no proposal to remove marijuana from Schedule 1, nor is there any proposal to allow the industry to operate legally. You are still at least 5 years from seeing any real change at the federal level.

Anyway, PLTR 50c 1/8 holla
While idiots in his mind mouth off about GME to the moon and other shit like that they give me a perfect trigger when to sell

Seriously one of the best shows out there
100% I agree with you. the mistake I made is my strike dates are too soon and some of the targets are too high. I will probably do another very similar position without Moderna but at a strike lower and around or close to 2022. after I dig myself out of this hole. I have to make the money back.
For anyone thinking xpev is gonna run up from 42 to 74 again in 3 days, think again, it ain't happening. Lightning doesn't strike twice.
TSLA seems to gap up more than it gaps down though. Any particular reason you think it's gonna fall after the market closes?
It didn't move the November election or leading in, not sure it will move greatly now, but it is certainly the safe bet if you want to potentially hold till June. The lack of options are what turns me off. If I buy a lot and can't at least sell calls on it at a strike decently higher than NAV I could just have a -1% gain for 6 months.
Still cant log in TD. Piece of shit company.

Or just keep raking in dough selling them. Atleast if i get stuck bag holding it will be at a decent price.
What about nuclear waste? I heard that a big argument againt nuclear power is that we have no way of recycling nuclear waste.
I was actually thinking this too.  You could sell 100 way OTM calls, still pick up around 1-2%, use that money to buy another lot and sell an ATM call on the new lot - rinse and repeat.

Nukes aren't the same weapon they were 50 years ago. Even if they decided to unload their arsenal on us all most of their nukes would never hit the ground. Most countries have anti missle defense systems all over, and let me tell ya. They work amazingly. Also if they did that they would be killed by everyone else's nukes as well.

That's the issue with nuclear weapons. They only work when the enemy doesn't have them too.

The Wire has the better plot, pace and better written minor roles.  The Sopranos has the best casting, an excellent setting, and maybe has the best individual acting performance ever.  Breaking Bad was the most powerful. and maybe has the best individual acting performance ever.  


The pacing of The Sopranos and Breaking Bad knock them both slightly for me.  When I watch The Wire, it just flies bye.  There doesn't seem to be any slow, uninteresting episodes.  The Sopranos as a LOT of filler episodes and Breaking Bad is guilty of it too.

It made sense to be a consolidation, however it seems like many are looking for any reason to bail.. was wondering if being down close to 800 pts if that was going to spur off panic selling or if it would level out and rebound as it did. Just wanted to get the overall sentiment

What do y’all think of SBE $40c 1/15 ????
Imagine buying this dip 😂
So I actually lost a fuck ton of money getting greedy. It kept going down as soon as it hit 120 so my plan was to buy a put at 120 and call at 115ish so I sold my 120 call and the next day it blasted to 132. 

It’s not some scheme to screw people over. It’s part of their contracts. Some stuff about how after initial date certain amount of options will be automatically exercised amortized over 48 months. 

If you can gather the dates of the sell offs it’s actually a really easy way of making money by timing it.

Right now is a good time to get in imo

Something something power hour. Right guys? Right?
I was able to do that though. That's why I got confused. I have 135 shares of PLTR. I already have a covered call 31c 1/29. And as a test I placed another one 36c 03/19 and RH said my collateral is the 100 PLTR shares (which is also the collateral for my other short position)
1/15 AAPL $132c. Y’all think I got time for it to run back up or should I cut losses now?
Youre gonna be fine
Airlines going to come back strong this year! Waiting until a bad earnings day to buy in!
Eod sell off incoming
Same...Holding overnight too
I started +5k, now -15k. You beat me
Retirement secured.
Well, they've never made money in 10 years
I have a 200 option bear call spread at $20/$30. Up about $13K since I bought it, I think on Dec 30th. Just trying to guess the top.
Is buying in today dumb fam ? It was on my watchlist for a week but I didn’t pull any triggers cause idk wtf they do lol
If I had to make a bet I’d say sometime before Q3 2021. Also, even presently, I’d say TLRY is undervalued. At the very least, even with very little legislation for legalization in the US I think we see TLRY at around $14 or higher before March. This is based on its assets abroad in Canada and Germany. APHA paid a nice premium for them for a reason
Man, I hope so. Just loaded up on some choice weed stocks.
What screeners do you use?
. Should I go all in on AAPL shares with margin?  I’d be happy with 10% gain by Feb 1.   Got $100k
Yikes, at least you have time on the clock.  Im looking at $35 1/15.

Looks like all your positions (airlines, cruises, vaccines) are variations of the same vaccine/reopening play. They should likely move in tandem together up or down. 

I personally believe in the reopening play myself and am positioned similar to you. I'm holding onto them. A down day or two ain't changing my thesis.
Now if I can just not get margin called, imma make some tendies when this recovers AH 🚀🚀🚀
Fedex has drilled so much since earnings, it’s not even overvalued at all anymore. I said if this hits $250 I’m buying calls. I’m gonna push that back to $245 depending on how tomorrow goes.

oh you poor bastards. if only you'd listened
TSLA was days away from closing its door not long ago. It also used home depot trim molding on its cars heat pumps, which are now failing in the middle of winter. It's still the 5th most valuable company in America, so I guess we should be long on PSTH.
PLTR gang told me we’d be at $30 this week. Lucky to be at $25 by end of 2021
We need this
You are a certified idiot. This is why one of us is poor.

No you’re a full on retard. Has $300 acct balance, loads in 40k, YOLOs 25% in two trades (which I’m guessing there’s two buys because you fucked up the amount of contracts the first time) end then think because you purchased contracts totaling $8k that you lost 8k...even though that was the purchase price.

I don't fully buy the conspiracy theory, but I think part of it is the fact they did not allow the purchase of shares pre-IPO. 

Hard to believe they are being punished for this specifically. It does make sense that funds would be bearish on them, at least in the short term. If you can't load up on shares pre-IPO and dump them when it spikes, you'll just take the short position and make money off of retail investors panic-selling when the stock is down 2%.

It is very close, because the FED's demand creates a higher price for the bond, which is advantageous to Apple, because it means their future debt is worth more to investors and they can set the rate for example 0.25% higher (because there is a non-zero probability the FED will buy it from banks if it goes south).

Are you so stupid that you could not make the above logical derivation?

On the same note, a couple days ago I was rewatching Goodfellas and it went like this:

“Wait... his wife is Dr Melfi from the Sopranos! And that’s Christopher getting shot in the foot, and there’s Paulie on the back... and was that Pussy? wtf”

And that’s how I found out that Goodfellas and The Sopranos [shared 27 actors](https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/sopranos-and-goodfellas-shared-27-actors-a6841556.html) lol.

Not necessarily, a market-based socialist economy operates in the same manner; this is what China did, as well as Norway. 

The way the economy operates compared to other governmental aspects are not mutually exclusive. It can be both socialism and fascism, but it seems socialism is more appropriate here given there is nothing to indicate nationalism or ethnic superiority which are common tenets of fascism. Perhaps the fact that there is still elections can be indicative as well, unless you view that the Fed, being an unelected private organization is dictatorship. On the other hand, the Fed being private means less likely of direct lobbying but this is not to say cronyism is not possible.

The political spectrum is actually a continuum.

I believe in Bill Ackman and his management team. This is the only SPAC that big institutions put their money in, and believe me, Wells Fargo and Kevin O Leary dont put their money in for no reason. They want to make money.

My ultimate risk is losing 37% because ive bought it above the NAV. The upside is maximum potential and the downside is minimum.

Do you guys think these old ass hedge fund managers are sourcing verified PHDs in charge of ordering booster shots? Fuck no

>In actuality, there are most likely around 50,000-100,000 reinfections in the world, excluding asymptomatic first or second infections which may not have been caught on either screening.[[0]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kj6f2s/observational_study_on_healthcare_workers/ggv298c/)

100k reinfections = B cell immunity trash

>Our findings show that the protective COVID-19 IgG antibodies rapidly decline over one to three months. Rapidly decaying protective IgG antibodies would impact herd immunity and vaccine durability. It is critical for the potential vaccines to generate both protective T- and B-cell immune responses in a sustained manner. 

The PHD with the estimate is ordering the boosters. Checkmate, market. After 1000% gains last year, playing with a quarter million, I only do more research. Read the [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/klnxl1/vaccine_boosters_could_be_needed_153_days_after/)

No, it isn't I started this year with 24k made about 9k, and then tried to do very risky plays(still have about 10k in other positions). My biggest mistake I think was thinking MRNA would change the pandemic which was a bad call definitely learned the lesson. 

Did you think that everyone who lost money investing just didn't do research?

They do you are correct. had no intention to be ignorant (i do apologize for that). I got too greedy and cocky. Now just trying to do some damage control and get that gain back.

Isn't it a shame that the market is so binary? stocks get bought, stocks get sold. A sell today is profit taking, a sell tomorrow is waning confidence. The red and green are meaningless really, at least until tomorrow.

Excuse me. What is a LEAP?
Lol same it is just under a horizontal support and just above the 100 EMA on the daily chart. I have leaps I bought at 36 but I bought some shorter calls at 48. 

Defs should have taken some profits when it hit 55 but the fear of missing out on more gains got me.

No the government is much more likely to impose excise taxes on sales of pot if it's legalized.... Margins wouldn't be impacted by either

Believing in a demonstrably false thing does not grant the believer unfettered ability to act as though the false reality is real. It's still illegal to request the exact amount of votes you need to win get "found". Especially since he did so on a phone call where they specified they were looking for a "less litigious" solution (i.e. extra-judicial since they lost in all the court cases).

I liked CGC too, and I still think it’s a good play. What puts TLRY above all other weed companies is the market share they got from the merger w APHA. That’s the main reason why I like them so much short term and long term, above other weed companies.

Thank you  [u/vitocorlene](https://www.reddit.com/user/vitocorlene/)  for taking the time to inform us and ignore the hate from dimwits.

I did some researches on my side (although I'm a complete newbie), and I see that this trend is impacting positively many stocks including small caps that are way less global. 

As I'm investing from Poland (you can roast me), I took a small position on 15/12/2020 in WSE:COG (Cognor SA), "a Poland-based  company that operates in the steel industry. The Company's activities  are divided into four business segments: Scrap, Production, Distribution  and Other"

71% of their sales is internal (Poland), 14% is to Germany, the rest is global. 

In just 3 weeks, I'm way up (20.66%) ! What do you think about that ? It seems that no matter how small or big a steel public company is, it will capture the trend anyway.

Good thing NKLA is green today. I was starting to think I didnt understand this market.
The House was quick to pass a bill to legalize a month or two ago, but it died in the senate. Congress is quick when it sees a tax revenue opportunity like this.

Even if your scenario happens and federal weed  legalization doesn’t occur for a while, there are many states, such as New York, with large untapped markets getting ready to legalize it very soon. 

And with a blue Georgia, the mere prospect of federal legislation for weed legalization will be enough for TLRY to rocket

I didn't lose money today 😎 2021 off to a great start
The risk to reward ratio of growing pot as an entrepreneurial adventure is fucking terrible is what I’m trying to say. While weed laws loosen regulation on illegal growers is increasing with increasing fines and jail time for a market that’s over saturated. You’d have to be a member here to think it was a good idea to try to start an illegal grow op to make money and not go to jail. 

Simply put states will be more effective in regulating growing because they don’t want an illegal market to cut out tax money from the legal market when states are at historic deficits that’s the main reason weed is passing.

OMG SPY MOONING
no you won't make the same profits, my studies are a bit dated, but basically most of the profit is made from the couple of days prior to publication to the gap down at the day of the publication, by the time you read their reports and put the trades on stocks already are down a lot. I saw a study by some shit university that if you short the stocks exposed by short activists on the day of the publication and hold them for 6 months (maybe it was a year?) you might make 20% or so on average, but it's clearly not worth it, 

obviously it will depend on overall market conditions, but hit and run is the right play, which is what most of them are doing, by the time you see the reports the easy money is already made
Am I wrong ? People short tf out of Tesla. Then it just goes green dildo anyway. So I get puts to capitalize on those dips

Definitely. Even before the offering of fractional shares, there’s been other opportunities for small retail investors like mutual funds and etfs (this somewhat recently). It just sucks that people see the entire market being owned by the Bezos and Musks of the world when in reality institutions like insurance companies and companies managing middle class worker’s 401ks are a huge part of these markets.
I didn't know we could sell.

This means margins are going to be garbage even if you see massive revenue growth

Well NIO is around $53.09. I bought the spreads ITM , not far ITM. (47.5/48). They were right below ATM. When NIO started rising more quickly earlier , I was surprised that the spread didn’t increase more value quicker. (I guess i still
need to learn more, very new at spreads). At one point i was up 92%. Then just put a limit price on it. But it’s been holding pretty steady at 60

i'm up over 100% since i bought tesla, should i sell a few before the incoming uncertainty of Jan 6?
Yes
As a Norwegian, I would never have guessed our fund actually had stakes in GME. However, this idea is just too good to pass up on. It does not look like our fund CEO got Twitter, but we should all reach out on Linkedin

do you guys ever take profits or do you just hope for stocks to always fly and never realise your gains?
Illinois sold 1 billion dollars worth of weed in 2020.. apparently its not worth the trouble to grow it yourself
GME gang what’s your positions? I’ve only got 100 small pp shares and a call.
Burn my last day trade on ACB 11.5c 1/8s that I’m up 60% on? Or we think this will run again tomorrow?

Illogical markets have been priced in to the market, you retard.
Retard over here, what am I supposed to do? Buy the stock?
Don't let the Boomers scare you off from stocks.  That expected rate of return is using 1970s metrics that haven't worked in the last 20 some years.  1970s value investing and metrics gets way too much credit.
LMFAO i love you.
bad jokes and a lot of immaturity seems to me
Probably a wasted effort - we're all illiterate

I think Tuesdays are cursed to be red when there is a green Monday (except Tesla sometimes) but maybe a red Monday changes things...

This is the easiest way for sure.

Yes? We went through this in Canada as a progressive country that didn't have cops shooting us for having a dime bag on us. For every 'pot smoker' you have who is going to buy more, you have more people who get to try it the first time because they are law abiding. 

It took a full year for our farms to meet regular demand.
Well value shopped at airbnb....let's see
It reached 130 like last week
I still agree with those concerns about Moderna. Getting herd immunity is important, but it’s also important to make sure we don’t have a wave of millions of birth defects in 5 years.
Question. If GMEs float is already short and the rest of us autists are holding, WHO TF IS SELLING???
Its squeezing in the wrong direction I guess
I forgot about that - thanks for the chuckle from the past!
Nou.
Wow, you made me hate you so quickly. Congrats and fuck you. 🎉

+1 on what you said about the retard.
Oh no, I am an absolute retard. My wife is spending the evening at her boyfriends place tonight.
Sounds like you are a card-carrying member of the lucky sperm club.  Good luck out there, Richie Rich.  PSTH or the ARK ETFs will set you up for life, though you seem pretty set up already at 20.  Just remember to do good with your money and help those born into less fortunate situations than yourself.

And if you really want to YOLO, try GME.  Following Bill Ackman in his investor-friendly SPAC, though smart, doesn't require the biggest balls in the world.
You would think the name of the subreddit would have the word Bets in it, right?
Is it just manipulation so big money buys in?
Are they talking about me? PLTR at 33
how much $$$ did you lose going long on a dying B&M business brotha
Been in the house hunt for the better part of 6 months. Every agent I've spoken too has told me that pre-qual letters from $RKT go to the bottom of the offer pile, forcing me to find a new lender. Puts on $RKT
same thing they do everyday pinkie pump it in globex and dump it in rth
I seem to recall being told “it literally can’t go tits up.”
If AAPL breaks back above 129.20 or so, hang on for the rocket ship bois

Edit: There's massive established support around $128 so, we're either going way up or way down in the next couple days
Everytime I look at PLTR it is up $0.05. Pretty cool

Practice loss management. You should have gotten out at a10-20% loss. Add your Theta to the days you had it then add it to the price at open. That would be your new break even. Assuming that this Friday the 8th is expiration
Yes! Keep going WKHS! I’m only 69% down on my 1/15 $25 now!
Sounds like my work
will you guys ever recover from this financially?
Sir this is wsb

If you're planning on doing this by hand, it likely won't be fast enough to capture gains that high. Reacting to tweets like this is a fairly common algo strategy, and it happens a lot faster than you're able to receive a tweet notification and react.
Hope they print 🙏
What the plan was... they've been frothing for weeks, now they need 2k...
Too bearish and doom and gloom in here. 3:00 pump here we come

If you are doing anything, you're buying NIO calls and getting rid of them by Friday.
I should have listened
STOP THE COUNT
GME might find support at 16.60 - if not I'll buy more at next support at 14.85!!! Fuck the shorts
yes, but it's small at the base

looks sort of like squidward's nose

it's okay I guess

Wow, we’re really searching for anything about GME today.
So how do you plan to account for the fact that the reason they build in China is because 1) they don't give a fuck about their environment and 2) land/labor is cheap and plentiful.

You'll never reach the disgusting level of wages you'd see in factories in China in the US.

It's easy to say "just create more local jobs", but it won't happen unless big business sees it as profitable, and it won't be profitable without gross disregard for human rights.
It means hold on to your nuts.

I am not a financial advisor but there is usually a runup before the merger happens. It’s close to NAV by now, I think you might be salvaged. Definitely sell covered calls if you can.
Fed fucking Ex has lost me more money than any of my meme stocks.
For shares don’t most places let you buy immediately if you avoid that rule where you sell within the same day?

Ah, yes. The DD after the run up. Classic.
Anyone buying spy puts anticipating a Republican loss in the runoffs? What’s the best one everyone thinking?

There's a good chance we'll go Blue in at least one seat (Loeffler loses) if not both. The President has done a good job in hurting his party in Georgia over whether the State will lie and go for him v. him sabotaging the party because he doesn't get what he wants (11,780 votes). I'm surprised a d in awe at how our SOS is handling it here and applaud even the Lt. Gov for sticking up for what's right. Lot of heavy returns from reliably Dem areas and new areas, like Cobb and Gwinnett, while a lot less in the rural areas. Typically they show day of, but the question is will they show after the oast few days of Trump turbulence re: the steal. Tomorrow should be fun!
AAPL on big sale today. can they adapt that to their stores so i can get an iPhone 12?

SPY dumping
"I have done research so I don't know where I went wrong."

Did you think that everyone who lost money investing just didn't do research?

You bought a bunch of calls that will expire one day. The default behavior of these is to lose all time premium and go to zero. 

I hope this wasn't all your money, because that's an expensive lesson.

Why sell off. Fuck Georgia that shitty state
Depends on your BMI? THC stays in fat, so if you don't have a lot it is less... more takes longer to clear.
That's a tough one. I was only going to buy shares because I know $75 will happen, I just don't know when. Could be next month or next year. With your calls, better hope the events the next 2 days don't take the entire market down.

If you had to pick between ARKK and ARKW calls for 6 months which would you go with
I would say it's better because it's so good at exploring the shades of grey and the reality of the inner city situation.

The Sopranos is pretty clear cut, these are deplorable people, and they are doing deplorable things. The point of the show is to identify with the human aspects of these monsters when they show up.

The Wire is pretty much showing the opposite. That regular people are results of their environments, and the environment that affects these inner city youth is what's deplorable. It isn't a story, it's reality. People are growing up in these situations and turning to the only thing they can, and the people who should be protecting them (the police) are being conditioned to see them as an enemy combatant.

Both have an interesting message, but I'd say The Wire has a more powerful message.
They had some calls that not looking to good eh
QS today is so cathartic.
Yup, bought contracts for 85Cs on it for like $85 that ran to 1800.

Chewy was great to me. This retard bought at the top after a run from 75 to 105

These boring sideways/down days are so easy to misread. You could convince me market crashes 11% by EOW or +16% EOW.
It’s maximum possible profit. That’s assuming delta is in your favor. As I mentioned, because the short leg partially offsets the theta decay of long, you are more affected the delta than theta. So even a modest  stock movement in upward direction will lead you towards maximum profit at expiry.
This is the wrong sub for that try r/investing
I have debit spreads expiration 1/8 NIO. 47.5/48. I bought the spread when both legs were ITM. They were not far itm , right below ATM. At one point NIO was around 54 today. I’m aware that theta decay on the short will increase the spread value. I think. As long as NIO stays above 48 till expiration, i should make full profit correct ? I will close right before expiration to avoid pin risk.

Market's only crashing because I decided to buy calls for the first time in months on Thursday.

To be fair, assuming it gets legalized on the federal level you're going to see Canada likely supplying to the US in the early stages as there is absolutely no way the US would meet demand for the first year. We know this first hand. So probably not a bad idea especially since ACB doesn't have super crazy volatility. He bought at a low as well. 

So this position probably has more thought behind it than most people put into their tendie sauce of choice.

These businesses don't create losses, they write them off. They simply wait for a good time to write them off to offset gains they made during the year so that their books show no profit, when in reality it was losses they might have had for years before they finally "took the hit" so to speak and sold whatever bad asset was losing.

Basically what it say's on the tin, somebody bought a stock, and the seller failed to deliver said stock to them (or rather their broker) in time. This might have innocent reasons like some software fuck up, or something like this, but it also might be because someone sold a stock with out either owing one, or having one borrowed.  
The later case is called naked short selling and is more or less illegal.

A word of warning on a Schnitzer Scrap play.

 New regulations defines 13 carbon steel (ferrous) scrap grades and two stainless steel scrap grades proposed for acceptance at Chinese ports.  Schnitzer's main rise in scrap exports came via Turkey and it is unclear what their current stock grades are.   Much of China’s internal scrap industry is accustomed to filling orders for basic oxygen furnace (BOF) mills, where scrap makes up a single-digit fraction of a melt, and chemistry requirements are not nearly as strict as those for a majority-scrap-fed EAF facility.  That being said they are also making $17 per ferrous ton vs $3 in previous years.

The 2013 GME position was 51 million, is this because the share price was $50+ per share? 
Did the reduce the amount of shares?

Or just going down in value as share price dropped?

You have literally no idea what you are talking about. 

Failure to deliver has to do what shorts covering 10% failed to cover and will get fined as a result. It has nothing to do with GME itself.

I misread this as TLDR
[deleted]
It's definitely a rough number at best. 

If we get a 70% overall gain, though (using today's low as the starting point), that gives a $14.25 share price. 

I paid $0.32 for the $9.5 strike. $14.25 would give an intrinsic value of $4.75, which would be a 15 bagger. 

Someone who went further OTM could get the 25 bagger.

If you have shares of APHA, when the merger takes place in the next few months you’ll automatically receive shares of TLRY. I forget what the exact number is but I think it’s .83 TLRY shares for every APHA share.
YES.  SPACs can drop below their "floor" because they are traded by people who make stupid decisions and buy high/sell low.  The only way you're "protected" is if the SPAC fails to merge with a target and *then* refunds the investments at NAV.

Why did MP take a dump today?
All things being equal your spread will lose value as time progresses. That’s why it’s advisable to exit the trade, if you have made decent profit, at least a week before expiry.
Account for inflation.
Would you rather put money in it and watch it pull back or not put money in it and watch it moon? Trust me, the 2nd scenario hurts more.
Well, GME is down 6.5%, so of course they are.

If the blue wave happens, it’ll be a matter of weeks when weed is legalized most likely.

If you wanna get some further out calls, 3/1 is their ER. You could also get leaps a year from now.

The beauty of Tilray is that there is huge potential in the short term and the long term. I bought my calls at a 1/22 strike but you could go longer and still win most likely

India is not China that it will outright ban American tech companies. A booming Indian tech sector would basically mean explosive growth for Google, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon etc. I would personally go buying Nasdaq ETFs than touch Indian IT service  companies that can easily be a beaten by something similar out of Indonesia or Bangladesh.
The market is about to moon out of its mind.
Stop doing DD

My theory with $T is to play close to the money, buy long dated or leaps, and don't diamond hands when it's green.

$T loves to swing up and down off the $30 mark and that'a not going to change until the economy blows up or it runs back to its pre-COVID $40 price tag. It would be amazing to hold $30 calls if it starts to run but I'm not holding my breath. Like I said, no diamond hands here.
Did you just assume that I’m not a retard?
its not the government money tho it‘s literally the peoples money? not like anything comes out of the politicians pockets

Is it considered market manipulation to be bullish or bearish on a stock and making your position known publicly?  If a company or stock was solid, it wouldn't see large moves simply because Citron tweets that they're shorting it.  See how Burry's TSLA shorts are working out.  Citron is just taking advantage of the clown market.

Is this a recession
Isn't it obvious? They ran out of PS5s, and so couldn't deliver it to people who wanted it during Christmas. Thus there was a spike in failures to deliver. Keep up.

Here's the main issue with those OTC stocks that people like you don't seem the understand. 

Since they're OTC, the big money is not there so they don't receive much volume. Canadian companies receive so much more volume so they're much more likely to rally harder. Look at what happened after the election. The OTC had a small rally while the Canadian ones rallied 50%+, some even rallied 100%+ because they're on US exchanges. So just stick with the Canadian ones for bigger tendies until the OTC ones register on US exchanges.

Such is life
Eh, I see things a bit different. Before the pandemic, I worked at a dine in movie theater, which was growing rapidly, so something to look for is long term adaption to a more premium experience. I don't think that the dine in exclusive chains are going public any time soon, but look for mid to large size chains that are making a full commitment to adapting. Also, you may see more mid budget releases rather than a ton of huge releases.

The term you’re looking for is realize. But how long are people going to be long and not realize their gains? What wait 4 years and wait for a rep gov again to realize them? For some maybe that’s okay, but for people and institutions who like to be in the positions for limited durations of time, that blows.

I'm buying shares. Bought 30 more today. Have 80 total.

I lived in SF (and now live a handful of miles away). Bennioff keeps buying bay area real estate. That seems bullish to me. Plus, I like the Slack deal for them. Salesforce has a VC arm and they have historically made great investments. Salesforce has also made good acquisitions (huge fan of the mulesoft deal). I think they know the Slack deal will work out for them as part of a broader strategy. Timing is the hard part to figure out here. I do think it takes at least 3-6 months to figure out the Slack merger integration; thus, the reason I buy shares.
Wait, is it 🅱️oe 🅱️ogan?

Probably not in the short term, the upcoming meeting will likely cause a boost, but won’t see a huge squeeze till maybe mid year, this is a long term one I think

Edit: truth is nobody truly knows when it’ll happen, or if, but either way GameStop is going to go up this year 🚀🚀 21 shares in
Is there a reason TSLA is up or just because it’s TSLA?
Depends whose perspective you choose to take. Xi and the CCP's centralized control allowed them to be a COVID winner. Hong Kong is bad PR, but in their view they have no chance on winning and all they have to do is wait until the year they get control of Hong Kong once again If they need to back off until then for PR reasons the will, if they feel like they don't have to they won't.

In addition, the CCP is much more powerful than Xi as an individual. His long standing leadership role is being used to increase investment as stability is viewed highly favorably internationally for investment (another reason USA is going to be loosing relative international investment capital, along with our inability to increase consumer buying power due to ideological freeze ups).

China see's Ma as the worst kind of rich person; someone whose own class incentives are at odds with national incentives, and is willing to be a loud mouth about it. Therefore they will stomp out his influence or make him stfu. Frankly if I was Xi i'd do the same, China's centralized control seems quite effective compared to the turmoil the west is sliding into. China see's massive growth potential, and is avoiding the quick drug of free-er markets that will spur short term growth at the detriment of long term global power and prosperity.

Yes mining companies are commodity producers. Their costs are relatively flat given a steady production volume, but their revenue is correlated to the market price of what they are seeing. For example $MP in their 3Q statement said their production cost was $1,389/metric ton. That cost is from labor costs, operating costs, etc but their revenue per metric ton was $3,393. If NdPr prices are up 35% then the ore concentrate the MP is up you could estimate at a conservative value is up 25% (downstream operations have higher margins so the ore price probably won’t increase as much). That 25% increase would estimate the revenue per metric ton to be $4,240, but their costs will probably be around $1,389 metric tons. As NdPr prices increase the companies margins will increase as well

They have taken an incredibly strict approach throughout the year. People had their front doors welded shut, laws around tracking people is different, their borders were already very well monitored. New Zealand just proved that even without draconian measures you can go virus free so I honestly have zero doubt about it.

Yes! Hoping it stays below 29.5 Friday so I can keep my shares. Probably buying another 100 this week if it stays under. 7% plus my weekly covered calls helps me buy more retard stonks.
$11.50 exercise price, but you can't exercise until a month after the merger, which is coming up in about two weeks.  Until they're exercisable they'll trade at a risk discount to the stock price if it shoots up really high.

Once the stock has closed above $18 for 20 out of the last 30 trading days the warrants can be called for redemption - so even though they have a 5 year term it's likely you'll be forced to exercise them prior to that point unless something catastrophic happens to the company.

When a redemption is called you have 30 days to exercise or sell your warrants or they basically expire worthless.  Theoretically you should make a good profit by the time the price is at a level where a redemption can be called - but there's always edge cases that can bite you in the butt.  For example if the stock was over $18 for 20 days and then went under for 10 days that still counts as 20 out of 30.
This confirms we are green tomorrow

Dammit, I'm day trade restricted. I thought I only made 1 day trade last week, but I guess there is something about using funds that haven't settled from a position only held over night? Hopefully I can talk them into giving me a mulligan. I can't go 90 days without my fix!!!

Apple makes their own lidar but they aren’t the only ones figuring out solid state lidar.

Markets Apple enter tend to grow because it draws in more competition since the competitors don’t see entering that market as a big gamble if Apple is entering.

Dead money unless you are holding ITM/ATM puts for a week or so to expiration.  Momo is gone, will drift down, IMO.

Can we all stop pretending that we are all psychics that can accurately predict the future eventhough none of us have any clue wtf is going on ?
Going to $15
ofc after my puts expire on 31st
I mean reason I'm holding is the change of where the company getting is income. They are now starting a renting service which has a margin of profit way larger than selling the machines and which revenue has quadrupled in the last year

Bro, I’m a teacher. Shutdowns aren’t a new thing in western society. If our society is so weak that a shutdown is causing child development issues, and mental health issues, what does that say about how we have developed as a culture? Maybe if our current administration had led us in a more positive way, mainly Devos’ handling of schooling and transition to online, we would have been better setup. But nope. “It’s a democratic hoax.” I’m not a selfish fuck for wanting to make sure we are doing everything we can to prevent deaths.

I totally expect GME to go up 5000%, that is a reserved estimate of 1% for every award.
I mean, uh, those are the things they are already doing so yeah it is priced in. But I'm saying if they got all that going on already before most people know about them, that the prospects for the future are bright. Maybe not the moon but I don't think anyone who is holding for a year or more

WSB hates money
nothing is gurantee but hopefully
Just gonna say it: Americans on average have a propagandized view of the Chinese, and it will lead to many of yall missing out on incredible investment opportunity. 

I think China looks at us and does not see a country that has the governmental or societal set up to keep their/our relative power in the world. China's mean income is $15k a year, so much room to grow and they are growing every year. Centralized control is a pretty big W IMO for the 21st century. Using their influence will be a way to avoid many of the traps we have fallen face first into. Their fear is messing up the growth, or allowing foriegn investors to soak up the growth. They will use their power to make sure neither happens, and people like Jack Ma who want their economy to become more free to be influenced by globalized capital are viewed as dangerous figures.
He didn't.

He said "no such deal" in response to someone congratulating him on a deal.

All that means is that it wasn't a done deal
Apple leaps looking YUMMY
Jack Ma who’s Ant Group IPO was supposed to be fucking awesome till Winnie and the CCP fucked him along with my potential tendies.
Is it though? The market's been historically unstoppable the last 6 months and we are dumping before an election on the off chance Dems pull out two wins and then use a slim 50/50 majority with Manchin as the swing vote to enact radical changes which would also need to be passed by a razor thin majority in the house and signed by avowed centrist Joe Biden.
Maybe 1% of this sub could be called real traders
Your 100% correct I was too cocky cause I made very good plays before and made 10k and then messed up big.

Nope, you're wrong here and magisteerial is right. Tesla reaffirmed their 2020 target on April 29, as well as in September. They had no pandemic disruptions after April.

If the pandemic hurting them was the cause of not hitting 500K, they would have retracted and changed the 500K number in April. They maintained it, which shows that not hitting 500K was a miss.
in the sense theta impacts the short increase the spread ?

I read that karp said something about becoming the best software company in the world and it got me thinking: what is actually the best software company in the world today?

Google obviously makes some great software but don't they make most of their money selling ads? Are they a software company really at heart?

Microsoft makes software but don't they make most of their money on services?

Apple is a software company but again not really.

So what is the best "software company"?

HRC steel prices up 15% from just two days ago and $MT is only up 5% since some of the big boys decided to buy in. All aboard the steel train $$$

By the way, steel dad mentioned how $CMC is an undervalued play. Recycled scrap has been gaining at a similar rate as HRC but $CMC hasn't seen the buy-in nearly as much as $MT, $VALE, etc. They beat earnings estimates last quarter, I'd expect the same on next Monday, 1/11.

Your willing to sacrifice the child development of an entire generation for a few old people that probably were fat and had 2-4 co-morbidities or were left in an old folks home to rot. Selfish fuck. And if they are dead it doesn't seem the lockdowns are working are they? The only thing they are accomplishing is destroying the lives of tens of millions, increasing addiction, child abuse, poverty, development, cancer treatment, dis-allowing people to hold their dying parents hands or their newborn babies. 

Keep standing on the graves of the dead to justify your un scientific bullshit lockdowns. You were probably sucking who dick until they said lockdowns don't work last month.

The new battery production lines being built alone are worth half their current share price. FSD is leaps and bounds ahead of everyone else, it's worth at least a trillion by itself and it's barely factored in if at all. Their energy business is a sleeping behemoth slowly awakening. 

Their software margins, already the highest in their sector, will become insanely high once the robotaxis are launched. The Cybertruck will brutally destroy Ford and GM's profits and will be the strongest brand product since the iPhone. The Semi is about to be built and change the trucking industry. 2 new factories are ramping up to 10x production by 2025 and 2-3 new factories will be announced. Their insurance business is about to expand in China. They are even hiring video game designers and there are indications that they will start their own gaming service or platform if you can read between the lines.

Shorting TSLA is like burning cash unless you're edging a position. 

Either own TSLA or don't touch it. You don't want to profit from a dip, you want to buy the stock if it dips.
Do you see tilray reaching $100 again in 2 years ?
put 4k into a wide slightly otm butterfly on tsla a month or two out.  
When tsla goes up close the butterfly at whatever staggered pace you have the stomach for.  
You could cash out for +10% in a few weeks or +way more percent if you managed to call a good strike
WE COULDA TURNED YOUR BOOLSHIT INTO A MILLION DOLLARS
LOL bear downvote gang is here early today, that’s the white flag of surrender that means BUY THE DIPS
Gotcha. Yeah I read the grip room articles, and wasn’t necessarily convinced on the buyout necessarily, but he made some convincing arguments they are undervalued compared to competitors. That’s why I’ll let go of my yolos (70,75’s) which are up about 20%. May add some shares as well.
Up 100% on the 40k I put in beginning of December 2020. 
Down 45k all time though still, so I feel empty. 

Baby steps
Do it, don’t even think about it, just do it
Nobody said I was a genius -- that being said I was already in on SPY calls at 380 and averaged way down when it dipped to 364 and I'm green on the position now so I'm stuck in it and diamond handing it, 10 bagger or bust
How did you lose it today? All the meme stocks are up
When's that

Edit: Nm. Hope you're right i just uncomfortable bought close to top today

I got in on warrants a while back, just under $2. 

I'll be honest - i have no idea what I'm supposed to do with them. lol.
I've read so many different things that I'm not sure what's true - I can exercise them if it gets to 21.50, or they expire worthless or who knows.

With that being said, and your disclaimer for the idiots (of which I am one), can you give me the TLDR(the S1) on GOEVW?

Remember remember the 2nd of September
Wait till after the election and see what’s what on Wednesday. It seems like a correction tomorrow also. And Wednesday. Which gives a big buying opportunity after
The reason for MRNA was I bought it a week after it hit 170. when I was making my spreadsheets I shoulda figured it was priced in and the 125 million volume will not stand for long. So the variables were way off because I never woulda thought the rollout would be this bad. The problem is states don't have money so they just give it to hospitals and others and leave it up to them. RCL is 1/29 aging the same thing it shoulda hit with momentum and EMA it had but today it was just dumped. 

I really appreciate the indie tho will probably take the loss on the DAL and RCL but will see with the rest.

Thanks

Sell some calls my man.
think of all the huge porn sites that need better insight into the terabytes of databases to customize and tailor the sick shit you watch so they can send it to amazon to sell you butt plugs. Then think of the lazy management at weibu and jingdong that need crucial insight for their suppliers to get the right materials to make the rubber skin for those asstoys. Then think of the shipping, tracking and sales information they all need to make sure you don't buy your taint-pleaser from their competitors. Then PLTR says install this and they do, and your wankbuddy arrives same day. But your wife finds it on the doorstep because you thought it was coming in 3-5 days and now you gotta explain your sorry self. At least you can buy her a diamond like a bitch because your shares gonna moon retard
Next yolo play is teleportation buy your calls boyz

\- The nice people here started buying on Mon 11/30 and Tue 12/1  

\- The next two day's (when those transfers should be cleared) the amount of GME shares that failed to deliver absolutly exploded.

Edit: It was Fri 11/27 not Sun 11/27

Yes hello fellow bulls, was our flight to the moon rescheduled? Thought we were taking off promptly January 4.
NIO IS GOING TO THE GODDAMN MOON IT'S LIKE BUYING TESLA AT $50 FUCKING DO IT. 

IN all seriousness, Tesla capped their market by relying on charging. MOst this world lives in cities, more so every year. Tesla is America centric without realizing it. Very very very few people have driveways and garages in China, therefore a Tesla would be a fucking nightmare to own and you'd spend years of your life waiting at chargers. NIO hits the China market perfectly, and reviewers favor NIO over Teslas already.

good call, selling your puts now or rolling forward towards more downside?

I have Feb 80 and Feb 60 puts, now just about at 90% up and feel likes there's more downside to QS. I have a sell at a price on half of each that will allow me to run the others with house money.

Dems mean more spending regardless of tax increases. Gridlock doesn’t help anyone because there will be more longer lasting economic damage because turtle Mitch said no more stimmy and you bet that means no giant behemoth bills like GND or Infrastructure bill.
Does the market like stability? Once all the politics are concluded in the next 3 weeks, is that enough to set us back on the neverending bull run? Of course, there’ll be legislation that can cause dips but, otherwise, it just seems like uncertainty itself is causing dips like this when neither of the actual outcomes would warrant a crash.
😂
100% agree
Holding through a spac merger is like an earnings play. Might tank, might moon

Yep. Holding a lot of TLRY and BFT. I see them booming over the next month.

Naw, it riding rumors of her buying and in anticipation to Jan 11 where they are going to have speakers from all sides of genomics speaking on how they utilized Saphyr (BNGO genome map tech) to identify diff disease causes etc and how they can go about resolving it. BNGO keeps posting about more speakers and peeps keep buying. All aboard the hype train. Get em stop losses ready tho
Their main product is AI based SIEM/Intrusion prevention service that is so freaking nice to use. You can see everything that happens in your corporate network.

For example they had regular analysts recorded for 2 years to teach the AI how to act automatically in case something happens (malicious actors etc -> isolating them out of the network and so on). Newest version of their service has also agents on the workstations / servers so it's not only limited to network anymore, but the whole freaking cha-bang. So basically they can automatically notice if somebody is moving abnormal amounts of data from sharepoint to external drive or even if there is stuff moved from computer to somewhere else.

Their pricing is a bit steep, but my god it's a nice product.

I only wish our company had the money to get it.. :D

Nah. And have no interest either. Being 💯 italian and having family members that can heavily relate to the aspect of the show, the sopranos hits home. Those one liners, the Italian slang, all prevalent growing up. Also growing up in Springfield, MA with a heavy italian population and mob ties alot of the shit on the show is right on point.

For sure a pnd by the man to the point where he's gotten a good faith violation on it. I got in around the $16 mark, after 2 days of previous dumping. Besides some issues with their EBITDA, I'm p bullish on them, provided they do merge in March which is what I originally saw.

Nope.
I feel like 2021 is going to be a good year for me. In December, I had nothing but red days, even as the market was green, today, I somehow have a healthy gain despite a red market. I think the sell-off probably ends today, my gains are almost back to where they were at opening.
Ayy how's about it T, we givem anudda 2 Gs?

Glad to see someone else in HD here.

I really like the company but it's not the kind of play WSB is going to want to hear about so I mostly keep it to myself.
Whoever played SPY daily for puts congrats and fuck you, I had no more day trades available and kept kicking myself the farther down it went

From a real Benzinga article today. 

“Advanced Micro Devices Inc. has a better P/E ratio of 123.93 than the aggregate P/E ratio of 70.28 of the Semiconductors & Semiconductor Equipment industry. Ideally, one might believe that Advanced Micro Devices Inc. might perform better in the future than it’s industry group, but it’s probable that the stock is overvalued. “

what would that be? the US (I'm assuming with "we" you mean the US) already lost all its soft power with the trade war which might be one of the dumbest actions the US government has taken in the last decade. On top of that the US withdrew itself from the TPP which was designed to contain China rising influence. I really don't see what the US could do after those blunders.

It could be worse. You could be saving that money in an account that will earn you .005%! 

With options, you know you’re broke immediately and things need to change. With savings, you gotta wait 30 years to find out.

Nice try, Xi.
I paperhanded them for around 20% gains. Was bullish but I was breaking my own trading rules. I overextended my margin and didn't want to be in debt for 'worst case scenario'. I'm letting the rest ride and don't mind a bit of turbulence at least until JPM conference. I'm not too sure on the buyout rumors, based on the options activity there can be but I think GILD is a bit oversold. I'm just going to keep monitoring price action for the next few weeks.

edit: I have to disclose that I own GME stocks (added more today which may bite me) and NIO (which I sold today at 53 which may also bite me) so you can have something to judge/base my decisions on.

Buy the dip bro.
She could have left and protected her family. She chose to give in to the plot of the Car Wash money laundering scheme. And Walt Jr was just a lame ass TV character.

Man in terms of rewatching, X-Files may be one of the best ever. I love their stand alone creature episodes and even the plot episodes are decent until about season 6. Then the writers got lost in their own shit.

But yeah I'm only talking season 1 of True Detective. That was masterpiece of a show. The last episode makes a lot sense actually, in terms of Colhe having suffered from ptsd, insomnia, and depression from his daughters accident. To me it really captured the black and white contrast between the two protagonists.
If you didn’t buy the dip today ur a r-tard

Yes I understand it's a function of the taxes, regulation hurdles, and also the efficiency in the supply chain in any given state in just saying it's fucked up that this shit costs over double the price on the medical market in massachusetts compared to the rec market in Colorado and the quality is inferior. It's crazy. In Colorado you basically can't even save money by growing your own but back here any idiot with a lamp and a spare room can sell weed cheaper than the big boys.

Hopefully Jack Ma will pull a Carlos Ghosn and leave China for good.
i hear ya. I'm going to tread lightly this feels different then the days leading up to pres election. no put buying around here, still strong like bull. I'm just going to practice some patience before buying any dip.

Lol I just watched it again. Probably the greatest prank of all time
Yeah I bought in at 11 months ago and didn’t sell when it was over 20 (mostly due to Schwab glitches). Still think we’ll get past 20 again soon but would have been nice to have doubled my position.
Was really looking forward to some mooning today. But we are just sideways. Ass start to 2021
you are physically shaking because of a -2% drop?
No matter how much you lose today

I think I'm really smart I think 🤓🤓🤓
Best place for your stimulus is 2 shares of BABA and 1 share of NIO.  If you like making money.
Never short Tesla to many retards in it
WTF is this "patience" he speaks of?
You retards will pump this but not CLVR, unbelievable.
They may go public soon. Let‘s short them!
Well that would suck...Should got out at 130
The opposite. Strong dollar bruh
PLTR puts are free money.
It's too late
If you don’t have a job and received the stimulus just act like you got paid for your “job”. 

Worry about job searching next week brother, you earned your 600 this week.

They are supposed to be announcing partnerships. That is the catalyst, as many people think they will partner with a big name in the delivery space, established auto company, or something like Uber or Lyft. However, this could be a negative catalyst if the partnership is shit.

I don't think anyone gives a crap about georgia - at some point taxes have to go up to pay for all this stim. But I don't see anyone dem or rep willing to bet the recovery stalling over taxes for at least 18-24 months - so who gives a shit who gives a fuck.
Probably good advice.  Let me see how Margin is doing.
I have buy orders set at $17-$16/share. I have faith in fubo but that run up was just mega retarded. I think I sold my shares around $50/ea with a cost basis of 11.17/ea

It may not be widely known but all state owned corp have C suit level exec that have two titles, one is example CEO and secretary of the party (CCP party within the corp).

GA vote/dem control, vaccine slow, stonks bloated. just needed a stiff wind for everything to sell off.
July & August kinda poisoned my brain for a while into thinking any gain under like 400% wasnt worth securing. Glad I got over that lol
They can see sell walls like everyone else. They base it on volume x price.

Dems will be good for the economy but not the stock market. 

Once they have the control of the both chambers of the Congress, they will pass a whole slew of fiscal stimulus, and raise taxes to recoup the cost. They are both bearish on the markets.

If GOP has the control of the Senate. Dems wont be able to get those fiscal stimulus through, hence will rely on the monetary policy(QE most likely). This will be very bullish.

You all herd the man on CNBC.  Your orders are to buy the dip.
I've been in this turd stock for so long. Getting blasted today
Market's down 2% and the steel stocks are either even or up. Really hope this takes off when we have a few good days.
steve weiss is a big pumper and i followed him since $26 and kept averaging up in big dips. he said he speaks to management blah blah blah i am moroccan and my people know it and use and that's good enought for me. it's speculative trade and you have andrew left and steve weiss pumping it
People need to chill. Even if Dems get majority in the senate, the government still isn’t going to accomplish shit. The filibuster will still be around. And federal courts have been packed with so many conservatives that anything Biden does will be litigated until the end of his presidency.

What we need to be thinking is what is their pivot? Theaters may never fucking come back fully, but what can they do with their assets in this new "world"?
While there is no accepted definition for the “middle class,” median family income in 2018 was $63,179, so let’s look at taxpayers making between $50,000 and $100,000.

In 2018, there were about 35 million taxpayers in this bracket, an increase of roughly one million over 2017 (a growing middle class). In total, they owed $31 billion less in 2018 than in 2017. In other words, the middle class got nearly half of the $64 billion decline in taxes owed under the TCJA.

I just know about option pricing because I'm studying OAASI, I'm no genius, nor can I predict the market. But looking at the numbers and my gut feeling about when the recovery will really show in the market:

RCL 1/15, that ones's toast for sure

DAL, yeah 50.90 even seems a little far fetched, but let's not think about that for right now

MRNA, holy shit lol

RCL 6/18 I think you overshot the strike by a few dollars, hopefully you didn't pay more than 2.5

UAL I like your strike, I hate your expiry, another month out would've been my pick

The rest are fine by me

Corporations who intend on taking their operations outside of the United States should be barred from operating in the United States.

This stock isn’t going to move until the lockup is over, now that it’s down/sideways no one in their right mind is going to buy with another 300M shares coming on the market.

Fiscal stimulus is absolutely bullish, it's why we pumped for months on "stimulus hopes." Downside risk is in the megacap tech companies that the dems are going all antitrust on. So Facebook, AMZN, GOOG might dip. 

A split congress however will get nothing done which will be a huge drag on everything.

this is long known already (especially amongs the GME gang elites)

even he did underestimate how big this business can get (he sold chewy way too cheap)

he sees potential in GME and once he upped his stakes to 13% (which was basically doubling down as the second tranche was way more expensive) we can be for certain he is not going anywhere and just waits to charge in

just look an interview with that guy - he does not have to work in his life anymore but he still wants to create and achieve and if the stars align slightly he will make GME far greater than chewy (the latter has over 25x the market cap as of now...)

people may fight this news, but you're right, and the real underlying reason is that the scientific community is a fucking mess right now. this is a problem that goes well beyond COVID vaccines. the incentives for publishing significant research are too high, so the data is picked through to make findings seem significant when they aren't. 

you'd think that would mainly be a problem in the soft sciences, but health research is struggling just as badly. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6599599/ almost 90% of CANCER studies can't be reproduced, because the original studies were either conducted poorly or the data was massaged after the fact by finding bogus reasons to exclude participants who didn't respond to treatment.

when we're talking about COVID, this kind of fuckery has wide-reaching implications for the world's physical and financial wellbeing. it's going to be an insane clusterfuck, and the only saving grace is we're all used to COVID at this point so we can probably just grin and bear it for however long it takes for someone to get their heads out of their ass and design a real vaccine.

At the end of the day, getting to Level 5 autonomy will involve three things - hardware, software and system integration.

Hardware is the easy part imo - it's not trivial but there are ASIL-D silicon that can implement Level 5 systems.  It's only a matter of how much redundancies you need to get there and at that point it becomes a BOM optimization and commodity sourcing problem. Again, not trivial but also not impossible to trade off.

Software including algorithms.  IMO, both Waymo and Tesla have a lot of data to train and deploy their AI models with enough reliability.  Both employ talented engineers and while I believe their solution will be differentiated, the difference from a safety perspective will be minimal to none because they have to adhere to safety standards put forth by governments.

System integration - IMO, this is the key differentiator here. Tesla is building cars from ground up with closely integrated sub-systems that will provide much better hardware and software integration.  Looking at functional safety down to the individual battery cells will provide a level of FuSa that will be very hard for Waymo to achieve IMO. They will also be agnostic to infotainment platforms (Android vs. Apple) which is less important for safety but gives consumers better choice from user experience.

I do agree with your assessment that we are pretty far off from Level 5 from any of the companies. My opinion is speculative for sure but based on what's needed to get to Level 5.
Any chance for a coherent response to the pandemic.

Americans paid almost $64 billion less in federal income taxes during the first year under the Republican tax overhaul signed into law in late 2017 by President Donald Trump, with some of the sharpest drops clustered among taxpayers earning between $25,000 and $100,000 a year, even as the overall number of refunds dropped during a turbulent tax season.

That’s according to Internal Revenue Service data

There are a few different options that I like, first would be if Hyundai started licensing skateboards for their newer vehicles - Canoo has helped them design their EV platform but that's an older iteration, so if they used the Canoo skateboard for the next gen that would be nice. Not holding my breath on that, it was just something I'd been thinking about.

Second is obviously if they got a big order for the trucks - that would be more effort to build than just licensing skateboard tech, but still great cash flow. And based on what they've said they'll prioritize the trucks over the LV if it makes business sense. I'm guessing they're moving in that direction based on the CEO's current push.

Third is another longer shot - but if they got some sort of partnership with Lyft or Uber for LV as ridesharing cars.  Initially I thought the LV would be great for private parties to lease and use as ridesharing vehicles, but apparently there's some mileage limit. So for that to work out it would have to be a partnership where they sold the LVs or got a higher lease rate for them.

Fourth is down the road a little bit, but I think their sports car model may actually be popular, and it looks like they have a prototype build - it was leaked in a recent influencer video.

I’m still leaning towards it being a p&d but goddamn that pump
XL has actual products, revenue, and big name customers and it's getting reamed almost as hard. I went long in the low 20s. If it continues to dump I'm sending my phone in to Robinhood for a full refund.

Made few 100k this year but I still stopped at a leather couch yesterday on the road to check it
Lmao aside from magnite thats all i'm in right now too. I'm pretty much selling my stonks to buy July $17 calls, I'm already holding April $20s but I want to go further out this time to be safer and ride a drawn out squeeze. I would do it bro, my logic is that there's really no stonks with absolute moon potential like GME and PSTH have. There are very solid plays don't get me wrong, but I'm trying to yolo but not yolo the way retards do here. GO ALL IN BRO

TLRY is a US Registered company. The main reason APHA bought them was for their market share in the US. TLRY has the market share in the US combined with APHAs share everywhere else. TLRY is a win win in my opinion, and if Georgia wins this thing will go to Jupiter.

You are aware it’s not that fucking hard to read right?

We estimate that the TCJA will reduce individual income taxes by about $1,260 on average in 2018, increasing after-tax incomes 1.7 percent (table 1). Taxes will decline on average across all income groups. Taxpayers in the bottom income-quintile (those with income less than $25,000) will see an average tax cut of $40, or 0.3 percent of after-tax income. Taxpayers in the middle income-quintile (those with income between about $49,000 and $86,000) will receive an average tax cut of about $800, or 1.4 percent of after-tax income. Taxpayers in the 95th to 99th income percentiles (those with income between about $308,000 and $733,000) will benefit the most as a share of after-tax income, with an average tax cut of about $11,200 or 3.4 percent of after-tax income. Taxpayers in the top 1 percent of the income distribution (those with income more than $733,000) will receive an average cut of nearly $33,000, or 2.2 percent of after-tax income.

I've been recently interested in NCNO as well, so I asked around to a couple of family members that are involved in banking and both had negative things to say regarding their product. However, both of their companies had implemented NCNO within the last year and that's a nice boost from the growth perspective. Both work for regional banks, over 10 branches but less than 50.

Well?
1) laughably false. The moment the terms of the deal were finalized they were released to the public. You were duped by Reddit astroturfing if you believe this.

2) Rumors ran wild because Reddit is pro piracy and therefore hate anything that enshrines US anti-piracy laws. So long as that is there most of Reddit would irrationally hate it, so they ran and invented rumors that were debunked immediately upon posting by the finalized terms of the treaty. We absolutely knew what was in the deal. Redditors that were against it straight lied repeatedly about what ISDS meant and about their effect on employment both of which were debunked routinely by lawyers, economists, and other well informed Redditors.

3) The USTR actually did go on the Sunday shows, give quotes to newspapers, and post comprehensive reports on the internet defending it and defending it well. This issue is that people chose to believe conspiracy theories peddled by the worst elements of society instead of the facts.

4) Of course the hard left on Reddit was anti TPP. They hate anti piracy laws so once those were in there it didn't matter what else was in it, they were going to hate it. They made up other reasons to hate so they didn't look like a bunch of dweebs trying to argue that stealing is OK. And I know y'all like to fall back on "orange man bad" once it is clear the facts are against y'all because you lack personal responsibility and don't understand what "the buck stops here" means, but if you read I actually call out Bernie as well in addition to Trump. Saying Trump is bad on policy X isn't "orange man bad". It's a legitimate policy critique. Simple as that.

Not sure but that’s absolutely been the trend in the past few years and will probably continue. With the assumption that an AI that can program won’t be developed in the next 60 years, there will always be plenty of programming jobs. It would not surprise me though to see outsourcing continue to grow. 

There’s no inherit skill advantage between an American tech worker and an Indian (or outsourced worked) one, only communicative and perhaps physical. So at a point it does make more sense to pay much less to outsource the work. I work as a programmer now and my company still outsources work. Primarily because of demographics but a hybrid system in which skilled programmers engineer and architect the code while the actual tasks of writing the code is outsourced out. That is common even now.

ideally, to the point you owe shares back to our broker that you can return for a decent profit later.
That is why you buy a put-spread. That way you buy an expensive put and sell and expensive  put to pay for it.

When 63 percent of Americans are living paycheck to paycheck and 93 percent ofinvestment equity is owned by 8 percent of americans poverty is not "at its lowest"  


Wages under corporate entities have failed to keep up with inflation itself and Americans are pathetically underpaid the more powerful a company becomes.   


Glad you're doing well, but if youve looked around there has been a shitload of anti corporate sentiment, even among traditional conservatives. Most people are incredibly unhappy with the current state of affairs regarding wealth and the economy. This subreddit only exists because we all know that Corperations give far less of a shit about their employees than they do for their stock price.
Don't need to mention that. If some Americans can't get their head out of their ass and realize there are other countries it's not my fault.

TSLA is profitable, you just proved my point for me. QS bag holders met Jack Ma today, and BABA calls are way safer and way less deadly because its a way better company while QS won't see profitability for years.

Yahoo Finance saying "If Dems win Georgia, mkt could see a 10% loss"

I don't know why we pay these turkeys to think.... None of that makes any sense, based on how things have gone over the past 10 months (Mkt ain't dropping 10% for nothin), and based on how poorly Dems perform politically. (Donny Fat Fat is on the phone actively soliciting voter fraud and Dems can't capitalize. DT could literally shoot someone on 5th ave and get away with it)

It's all nonsense

well thats exactly what they want you to think
ARKK is in the midst of a virtuous feedback loop where an ETF is buying stocks that have been going up a ton with a singular “visionary” at the helm. Because the stocks go up so much confidence is high in her and the wisdom of her investments as well as the fundamentals behind the companies held in the ETF. This causes more inflows which makes people more confident in the fundamentals behind the stocks, very few of which have demonstrated a lot of actual value in their markets. At the core there are companies that make little to no money with funds like ARK raising money to buy more shares which can work for a while but will eventually blow up.

TL;DR I wouldn’t touch either because when this thing implodes it’s going to be epic. Might try puts at some point though.

not sure i believe that the move isn’t based on the market pricing a dem win. that’s the point not whether it actually happens. i digress. the q was is the market dip today or tomorrow or a long ways away? this is a complete risk off event regardless of catalyst and there’s already a lot of $$$ on the sidelines. that’s going to go somewhere and it’s not gonna be bonds.

I YOLO’d it last week and sold this morning. I fucking hate myself.
Then maybe work on that but don’t let others influence you.
How much do you think they made ?
I thought the same. Should've inversed myself.
Bought shares for $2k at close to $20, which i would pretty never do to a SPAC. But this shit has some real good things going for it, wish i got in at 15ish, woulda bought so much more.
Please don't remind me. I've been averaging down and am still at -54%. 

$ROPE
Should’ve bought the dip on AAPL not fucking BA with this limp ass sick

TLRY will still have a large market share in Canada and the states where it’s already legal, even now it’s undervalued for the assets it has now. Dem states like New York, Pennsylvania, New Mexico are looking to legalize in 2021 as well. Worst case scenario Dems lose Georgia but there’s still billions in untapped revenue in the states I just mentioned. Best case scenario, Georgia turns blue, weed is legalized federally and TLRY has the majority of the market to itself, there are no limits to the possibilities for TLRYs future regardless of the Georgia election.
new year. new me. jk, i still spend 90% of the work day with you fuckers because it's way more entertaining

The doctor was reprimanded for saying there was a new SARS outbreak over we chat to people not affiliated with any of the infected (who had COVID), that dude went back to work and later died of COVID.

Everyone was under reporting, people found antibodies in Italy [in *November 2019*](https://www.reuters.com/article/health-coronavirus-italy-timing-idUSKBN27W1J2) (meaning it had already gone through their systems and probably spread). No one will know the real numbers for years.

That "journalist" was Zhang Zhan, an online conspiracy theorist who has been going around saying that the Chinese government made COVID-19 in a lab as a bio weapon. [Here is her YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/qbUgF_mQy90). She was also working with Radio Free Asia, a CIA propaganda outlet (Think about what would happen if a journalist here came out as working with the Kremlin) and with the Fa Lun Gong (a death cult whose members keep running headfirst into the Great Wall, among other things)'s newspaper the Epoch Times (who write articles without evidence).

I'm also gonna ask for a source on that last one because I hadn't heard anything about that yet.

No way Republicans lose tomorrow.  99% chance they win.  The numbers would have to drastically shift in the Dems way - both candidates didn't even get close to 50% of the vote last time, and that's with Republicans having votes eaten by multiple third candidates. 

No shot.  If Dems win I'll be very, very surprised.  Ossoff probably won't even get 45% of the vote
Do you see tech just outsourcing more jobs then? Economic strikes can result in scabs and a refusal to hire back. I feel as if all the kids coming out of school now have a tech background as opposed to when I did. So will the supply deflate the labor demands?

Hmm. I was in at 202, saw RSI around 20 figured it wouldn't go much lower, we bounced back to 204 already. I feel comfortable with this play for tomorrow but you're right, thats what makes a market.

Debating 250c LEAPS though, this would be a great entry point. In 1 year it won't matter if I'm in at 199 or 202.

'but my taxes' people need to [go look at history](https://www.macrotrends.net/2481/stock-market-performance-by-president) and realize both parties are pro business and republicans don't make stocks go up anymore than democrats do generally.

with that new trump tape and the cluster fuck they're making out the election, i'd put money on that being the reason for the market skepticism today. not fucking *georgia*.

Big deal on principles. Given the demographics of tech jobs, the employees tend be more labor friendly and there’s quite a bit of desire especially among the lower end of the industry for unionization. But because the tech employees that have the most power (the “middle and upper” class of the industry) have always been comfortable there’s never been a desire to unionize. 

Once the desire to unionize rises among the upper levels of the industry it’ll be an unstoppable force.

The ratio of words to rockets tells me that this is the one.

&#x200B;

I'm in.
This drop today is 100% because of the possibility the Dems win the runoff races tomorrow.

Hear me out: wall street loves certainty. You cannot have more status quo certainty than a totally deadlocked government. If Republicans own the senate, and dems own the rest, almost nothing but the most mundane, milquetoast policies will pass. This alleviates any uncertainty.

I think the whole election theft thing Trump has been running with has turned off a ton of Republican voters for tomorrow, making them think there's no point as it'll "just be stolen anyways".

At least thats my theory.
Get those ICLN 35C FDs.

I think you missed my sarcasm tag, because I agree with what you say. I was pointing out the absurdity of the argument because companies routinely do not build better products in house.
Ngl maybe
Probably own ARKK since they actively manage the portfolio
No man I mean the city folks paper handing. Good for you.

You can read the opt ed from the Tax Policy Center itself. 

Under the bill signed by the president 

 

"The richest 1 percent of taxpayers will get an average tax cut of $50,000 in 2020. That’s 75 times more than the tax cut for the bottom 80 percent, which will average just $645.  These figures are comparable to estimates from the Tax Policy Center for 2018, which found the average tax cut for the richest 1 percent to be $51,000 and the average tax cut for the bottom 80 percent to be about $800."

Market gods gave 🐻 the first 4 hours of 2021 to close their positions at -95% instead of -99%. It’s all up from here.
Big words there. What does it portend?
The difference from other binary events is this one is really close so you couldn't really "price in" one side or the other winning. Plus with trump's umpteenth gaffe you are now relying on republicans to yet again just shamelessly vote R no matter what. Not the best position in a state that R's literally just lost.

The U.S. dollar is down over 1% today against the Chinese yuan. A single day fall of this magnitude is rare and it's the biggest drop on the first trading day of a year in over 30 years. Do not under-estimate the significance of this move or what it portends for the U.S. economy.

The Wire and The Sopranos are in my opinion the best shows ever made. I won't pick one or the other for #1. The Sopranos has better acting quality and production value and I think The Wire has incredible authenticity, expansive character quantity and a very original, memorable plotline.

I bought some of those Jan 60c.  Congrats on the tendies so far.


“ha i made a similar trade on Thursday:

GILD shares, Jan 29 $60c, and a bunch of longer-dated calls - March, June, Dec and June 2022 at 65-72.5 strikes

I've been going to that conference for years. This year will be different given COVID but I expect a lot of announcements in January. Hopefully GILD buyout for $75+ per share is one. If not, I do think a lot of bad news has been priced in and digested by the market so GILD shares could just grind up slowly until more positive cancer portfolio news comes up”
I haven't gotten to it yet. I might soon.

GME is a graveyard 😂 RIP to those that didn’t sell that piece of shit lol
ok so it's just a speculation. If you look at their yearly position on GME. It'd been going down every year. Holdings on year 2013 was at $51 million and now they have $11million. That's almost an 80% drop in 7 years... They MIGHT up their stake due to Ryan Cohen movement but it seems pretty weak at this point.
It's just sympathy at this point, if UK reached this level a hundred years ago you guys would have fell like the Russian Empire.

So glad I held onto the put debit spreads I bought early last week. SPY put 371/364 expiring jan6. Felt like there had to be a selloff before the Georgia runoff.

Pltr
he does it any large move either direction
Lol I know Wall Street over reacts I just meant like why are dems going to cause a downtrend? Just asking cause I don’t follow politics whatsoever so I have no clue

Markets price shit in way ahead of what you think. They were making moves in october for a Biden win, not a couple weeks before he actually takes over.

Most of Wall Street actually chose Biden btw

> Any dip worth to buy?

GME. 

They are borrowing BIG TIME amounts to short the stock today. Apart from it being a red day in general, the large dip is primarily artificial. 

If you missed your chance to get in earlier, now is your chance to get on board.
Vix is so ply volatility looking out 30days. It has little bearing on market direction
True but I think people are overstating the likelihood of that happening. A split georgia is still good for stocks so it would take a Dem sweep to fuck up the market.
Lol lower rates are a meme. That’s like $150 cheaper a month it’s not going to change the game
Jan
Because they want the price to be as down as possible until lockup expiration (3 trading days after q4 earnings call) so that they can buy cheap. Then, they will boost the price like crazy
Wait how? My NIO calls have only been increasing since I bought em. 27% return today 70% return total bought last thurs.
This is a massive bull trap for UVXY traders

The Dems are not expected to win. The elections will likely be very close and will get tied up in so much litigation. that a winner may not be determined before Easter. Anyone predicting a definite winner at this point is a fool (or being paid, directly or indirectly, to make that prediction). Id say we will know by Friday who is leading in the count and will probably win. But certification will take a long while.

No. Your eyes are deceiving you. Make an eye doctor appointment.
Shares: Have some extra cash- if I want to average down PLTR or CRSR, which should I pick? I own a great deal more PLTR so dollar-wise I'm in worst shape there, but % gain I'm way worse in CRSR.. and since I'd probably like to exit there soon, I guess I answered my own question.
For those of you that follow airlines, I’ve noticed that whenever they have a big down day like this it’s almost immediately followed by a solid recovery day...or maybe I’m just retarded. Fuck it, calls it is

That would be great but I have no idea, it really depends on if they announce anything good this quarter to stop the stock from bleeding out further.  They said they had some partnership announcements this quarter, but none of their PR so far has made the stock skyrocket.

I made this play figuring I would probably win in the long run even if I take a hit for a little while - since the warrants have a 5 year term and $11.50 exercise I only need $14.50 to break even with this buy and around $13.25 for my first batch.

That's fine though, because spreads have time to wait, since they only get better as they get closer to expiry. Just hold.

Spy might fuck around and end the day green 😎
NIO is saving my portfolio in its own. It is a true hero!
It never was 🔫
Yeah Its been a major story this calender year, probably more so than the equity market. People are affording the increase because lower rates means your monthly payment is the same on a higher property cost. And if you are already in the real estate market then the increase doesnt hurt you since the property you sold should have increased as well (not always the case, it isnt for me). For people not already in the real estate market....well there is a reason youth property ownership is at historic lows and the highest proportion of 20 year olds in history still live with parents.
One of my stocks (MP materials) that I really like is down 10.5% today.  I had to sell one of the stocks I really like 3 months ago (Next Era Energy) that hasn't done shit to buy that dip.
Thanks bro. I have three so I’ll sell 1 and maybe let the other 2 ride
Clearly Hermes tie
100+ a share, moves like a boomer stock, up 3% today, and a p/e ratio of like 48.

CSIQ is way more attractive imo. Similar earnings, market cap 3 times lower, p/e ratio isnt insane

Lol market overreaction.
Before you even think about opening a position:

Everyone here always thinks they’re a genius

Always feeling like they see something hidden

Really, you don’t have a fucking clue. 

Seriously. 

And the more you convince yourself you do

Returns are just going to disappear 

Everyone gets lucky sometimes. 

For real, you see it every day on this sub. 

Until you look deeper and see the loss porn. 

Compared to the winners, far more losers. 

Know that this could easily happen to you. 

Everybody needs to understand risk. 

Done with the rant, thanks for reading.
Everything is an overreaction on Wall Street

We will see red for a week or two likely and less growth afterwards imo.

No one really. That's bagholding but in the real world. Write downs and short sales.
They don't need to flip anyone if turnout is high. Your entire argument is predicated on election trends which we are currently not even remotely following.

Easiest way to make money is stay patient homies
To be fair, GS just posts negative news so they can buy dips they cause.
There is actually solid DD and a story around GME. It is positioned to be one of the greatest turn arounds ever. 

The Financials are good enough for the company to survive in the short term. It has more cash on hand than debt, it also has a positive cash flow even in down times. 

A new stakeholder is pushing for change. He has enough shares now that he would have to disclose a sale beforehand. 

Most importantly the short squeeze potential. The shares are shorted over 100% of float. At some point there will have to be a reconing for this. If gamestop gives enough evidence that it will turn around the shorts will have to abandon ship eventually. 

This is not a pump and dump. It's a speculation play with more dd than most. It could be wrong of course but there is actual reason for believing in GME stock

Yep, still a loser.
Even if they win the Democrats don't tend to be progressive enough noir Biden to be for the legislation of weed. With a senate of 50/50 it's gonna be a hard one to get throught the senate and house with a conservative group that thinks weed is from the devil.
So trust the next time a other random person on the honest worldwideweb ! By the way ...call on pltr

You can truly tell who the dumbest people around here are during a red day. Usually they’ll say something along the lines of: 

“*political thing X* is causing markets to go down because of this *factually incorrect statement or opinion that validates the underlying political point*“ 

you all don’t know shit and are just virtue signaling your political beliefs. No one cares if you lick Biden’s or Trump’s boot we’re here to talk about gambling.

yall flip flop more than my ex did
Anyone buying the aapl dip?
BFT big fuckin tank
I bought the dip! :D
Someone buy the 2/19 28c I'm selling at $2 please
The market expected R to win and now it looks like D will win, which would be a huge boon for the market given the vast stimulus they would pass.

This is 100% rona-related. These new mutations are freaking people out. The British Health Minister said he was terrified and spooked the markets.
I think around 4k$ net profit right? 
this sun here is so unbelievable... haha congratz and fuck you
They'll vote for it if they think it will be neutral or help them politically. That's all. If a single senator thinks it's too risky, he'll avoid it. And again, not a priority for this administration. If they win the Senate, their main goal will be to avoid losing both houses in 2 years and facing 2 years of gridlock. So stuff like this is way down on the list of things they want to get done.

Georgia is no different than it was three days ago, so that makes no sense. If you want to make a political argument, it sure seems more likely that it’s the president of the United States getting caught trying to overthrow the government.
sell sell sell. get them tendies now!

Think twice before selling out of your positions. If you have stocks just fucking hold. If you have options look into rolling, hedging your delta, or a hard and set exit point. Don't just panic sell.
This is what I get for selling my TSLA shares after inclusion.
I dont think its CCP, too high profile, jack is probably having a midlife crisis and mental breakdown due to CCP threats and pressures so he is enjoying some "fuck you all" time at the bahamas.
Well I had a decent stop loss on AMD that saved a bunch of profits and day trades on a couple VXX calls
When the Dems win, this decision will leave you swimming in tendies as the rest of Wall Street is in the red. Good decision
You think this could hit $20 by the end of q1?
That adds fuel to the fire for sure.
Getting bent today, I wouldnt mind if there was a reason just seems like a lot of unfounded negativity.

Well obviously if you see something juicy take it
No, we are rooting for the economy and stocks going up. Bears losing money is a by product. Bears are actually wishing for economy to crash.
Has the last two weeks been a foreshadowing of markets under Biden?

Bland, boring and going down hill?
Healthy pullback and some eoy profit taking. The selling is no where near a black swan lvl, so we will bounce around this support lvl. Darkpool btd confirms.
Like I said, whether it works or not, at the very least it helps me base my trades on something and helps me determine entries and exits. It also helps leave emotions out of my trading since it just simplifies my trades to if this happens, buy, if that happens, sell. I don't have to bag hold something waiting for it to get to fundamental fair value.

I really don't know. What's your condo going to cost? If you have all the toys you are going to want some cash flow. You probably want 200 or 250 k per year to live on and even that might not be enough - I mean nobody likes the tightwad millionaire. That will probably take 5 million set a side.

I honestly fucking hate bears, y’all are so desperate for your puts you come in here and make up fake news about Xpeng faking their sales? Literally pathetic
Like it but how much extra work is that for you?

How would you police or measure that though? Would a 7 hour old top tier meme get knocked off by a newish meh one to fill the quota? Good concept but I see execution being a bitch.

the same people will be in charge now that were in charge then, i guess obama won't be there but it'll be biden, schumer, pelosi. biden's always been a friend to wall street. maybe the democrats encourage some sector rotation, but shit, they know where their bread's buttered. they look out for goldman sachs first.
Always.
Ya, but the reason it even went to a run off was because there were 2 republicans running. If you total the total republican votes it comes out to 2.25m to Warnocks 1.61m. Warnock would need to flip 318k republican voters. I wouldn’t be surprised if 100k or even 200k flipped but I don’t see a possible way that over 300k Republicans flip.
Should buy some dip brother like us
There any news? Why did we drop so damn much
yeah yeah THIS time is different..

CRSR maybe. The 30p would be safe and it bounces back from these dips pretty fast usually. PINS is my safe play. It's not worth too much but it's managing to be green.
I stayed up all night ducking this girl to not be able to buy spy puts this morning, instead I slept in 😊

Yep. It's just not a fast-enough play for most people here. I'm in on Chorus Aviation. Small regional carrier in Canada that has many guaranteed leasing agreements with larger carriers (namely Air Canada). On top of it still not being back to 50% of it's pre-COVID valuation, there has also been news of an acquisition offer.
So, today was a bad day and my birthday. I'm just hoping these calls revive by the 8th. At least my gf licked my asshole today.
Then you're gay
youd have to wait a month
like ~$60 max

Not good.  Last I looked they were selling for 3.92

I think Dems or republicans will be good for the market long term. I just think the short term dip is caused by pricing in a blue win, if the Dems pass stimulus then that'll get priced in when we know details.

Nah, you just lucked out on being right. The angry orange's leak over the weekend raised the risk that cap gains will go up, hence the profit taking.
Bounce motherfucker!!
Can I see yours  then ?
Massive spy buy orders...
The real stimulus is the friends we made along the way
Retards on this sub hate on citron because they A) have no idea how to value a company, they just piss into the wind and buy calls & B) get mad when their beloved meme stock they poured 5 months minimum wage into gets shorted.
A moment of silence for our brethren who held QS Calls and shares
This sub turns itself over every 3-6 months as ppl go broke and new tards hear about wsb. I'm waiting for a 15-20% pullback this year, September style maybe even worse, that's a dip.

Good time to load up on TQQQ?
I said it before, Wall Street made bets on a Biden win and it paid off. I’m making bets on another Dem win and I like my chances, yes it’s a risk but so are all things in life. Fortune favors the bold.

Green Day’s ahead for weed stocks if Dems win
Market is down bc dems are ahead in polls.

If the dems win both seats, they’re likely to increase the corporate tax rate, which will hurt profits, especially for tech companies.

So one republican winning would prevent those tax changes.
I bet the amount of money this sub has lost since open is astounding

Good job retard. Now hold it into the ground.

Curious how they do this. Is the less volatility just a result of diversification or a result of their trading. I suppose both.
Share lockup 

I've been told buy EOW
I’m not sure this will be over EOD. I’m not buying the dip until vix shows a solid down trend and is back by 17

That doesn’t make any sense.

It’s dipping on a the possibility of a blue sweep, but will have a correction (a fall of at least 10%) if the Republicans win?

Sir this is a casino. Diversification of portfolio can be found in r/stocks. Seriously though, who the fuck diversifies when they are trying to make serious profit in a short time. Find a company you have conviction on and go all in if your trying to escape the rat race. If you're content on just saving for retirement put 10%-20% in a matching 401k or high yield ETF and don't even look at the markets.

It’d be way cooler if SPY went up
Should I buy the JMIA or the MGNI dip
F
There are exciting people and boring people and everything in between. Some might say “wow there are people commenting in trading forums what losers”. Same thing you’ve done just a different perspective.
Back in my day, retards would actually buy the dips and not let us flail like this.

August 2020 were just simpler times I suppose.

I hope this isn't too political but Wall Street is high as fuck after being injected with emergency tendies from the Feds. The Dems is more likely to give the Feds more power to inject multiple emergency tendies into wall street than the amount the GOP is willing. 

TLDR Likely in their minds, GOP = 1 injection and Dems = Multiple Injections.

31 shares. Doing my part 🚀🚀🚀
QS happened
Take Tesla, NIO for example.  Just last year, they have raised over $15B from investors.  If they are successful with electrification and autonomous driving, they will destroy a ton of jobs - trunk drivers, gas station/hotel workers, mechanics, and even auto workers.  Of course reducing CO2 is a good thing but we can’t dismiss the fact that a lot of jobs are going to be eliminated as a result.

best dips to buy?
100k ? One day ?
Fake bad connection
Same with AMD. 😪
🥲🥲🥲
CRSR
happy bday
I have been in the 200$ range of getting my account to break even 4 times now. Then I buy apple calls, it always fucks me
Are people actually scared of the party that want to give out free money to poors who will actually spend that money?
The bulls saying "this is just a 2% dip" sound like those people who said COVID was just the flu at the first month
I’m fucked
Damn, VIX is on a moon mission, not a good sign
In a sea of red, INTC is up. Who knows
Relax. This dip is just a pre-election dip. The market dipped before the Presidential too. The election in Georgia is tomorrow. I expect it will dip again, then soar.
How is this happening to my 0DTE SPY put 🥲
I exited nio calls for spy puts very bold move
Wait, what is the situation in georgia 

and does the market actually care?
Market favors split government
How far out you going? They’re expensive
Yeah I've been looking at it for awhile but I've hardly done any dd. Hopefully I'll find time this evening because the price does look great and the little I have looked into it makes me want to buy.
realiity
Well if you believe the market is dipping today cause the market is pricing in a blue sweep then you should believe there will be a correction if a republican wins. At least in more republican industries for sure. Cause wall street wants a R win, so that imo is the reason for the red day.
do you really need to ask?
Profit taking check. Georgia runoff could flip senate. Check. Red today, theta day tomorrow. Possibly Bear red dildos for a few weeks. Any sell off means money will be on the sidelines temporarily but that money has to go somewhere and FED still in the game. 0 interest and expensive bond market. Dips won’t be as long or as deep as March so buy the f’ing dips.
[deleted]
ARKG been doin that for 2 weeks
Now is the time to take my other 25k out and start day trading the living shit out of spy puts
Just sold out of AAPL calls I bought this morning that were down 50% and switched to puts. Now AAPL will start its V shaped recovery. Thank me later.
Guess I’ll sell some more CSPs on PLTR. But you better be right in 5-10 years!
Looking forward to buying Amazon under 3k this afternoon

Damn what happened to the 🐝
Uhm it is. Look at the facts son. And I live in a blue state and still brought home more $
Buy the fucking dip
!remindme 2 weeks
Was holding NIO for NIO day or end of week, didn’t think entire market would just implode
I lost all my money today and it's my birthday. Thanks, god. 100k down the drain.
already down 5
wOw so impressive .. what a diverse portfolio .. not something %98 wsb autists are already doing at ALL
exactly. OP dreaming up a scenario based on "It's only ___________% of their portfolio!!!"

It reads like a really shitty conspiracy theory. Hope GME does well tho.
As a Saskatchewanian, I approve this message
Stahp!
Its called tax increases and awful regulatory environment dude 👍
14? It was nearly 30
Get fucked 🤡

I’m considering the same
NIO day 1/9
DIAMOND MOTHER FUCKING HANDS  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Seeing as it was 50-50 almost last time what else would Vegas say lol .

Doesn’t matter who wins taxes are going up for everyone everywhere .
There is a Reddit livestream where 5,124 people are watching some dude walking around and picking up garbage. WTF
Wrong sub sir, this is a casino.
It’s up 25% lol
That BA downgrade was nothing but someone wanting to get in lower, how thats allowed to fly is beyond me
I want it. Maybe is not 100% effective but can't hurt.
Whale oil?
Realistically is it a bad idea to buy this dip for tomorrow?
!remindme week from now
You have to pullback your foreskin to wash and keep your dick healthy
ICLN 2022 leaps, buy in the money and then also buy a money counter
Yeah, I think it’s time to stop looking at these charts for the day. 🥴
Hit me with that confirmation bias, sold my free stock from forcing my daughter to make a Robinhood account and bought more GME.
Stop buying puts and you wouldn't have this problem
Haha she is the girlfriend most men wanna have lol
Red by 2:00 EST
You touch yourself at night.

That plus worries about GA senate race
wtf is this post and what are shares???
People began taking profits two weeks ago and the late ones are here today holding bags. 12/28 should have been your last ditch sell signal
nio moon mission still on for this month?
Sell
What happen to QS?
nio
NIO will finish at 53 EOD
Agreed
Yeah keep buying bulls 🤡
This scene makes me cry every time
I hope you bought puts today then
QS 01/08 premiums looking juicy. 20 put. Is that safely OTM? Any safer puts I can write to expire OTM.
I have 50,000 to YOLO on a weekly. Thanks.
long term is considered more than one secind
and some people waiting til the new year to profit take
yeah, but if dems fail to win both seats then it could see some resistance and those positions could see some very bad returns idk... feb seems safer since I think it can still hit $11 even with senate loss since we still do have merger
BEST
If today’s bullshit is caused by the uncertainty of tomorrow’s elections, then what will tomorrow be like? Even more bullshit?

Bought 5 ICLN 1/15 $29c for when Dems sweep tomorrow.

Did my part by sending in my 5 fraudulent ballets from Illinois.
Euro Market just closed time for all you $600 richer Americans to buy the dip
Yet you think it’s because of an election for two senate seats in which either outcome would be just fine for the markets? 🤔
The other day, Wish pushed an ad to my Facebook feed which was for a product I can only describe as... a toenail clamp(?).  Needless to say, I bought 10.
How many big pps buying dips
Go to settings-> change text color -> set it to green. 

E Z P Z
Yup. But those September and November dips are serious business. The volatility of this market is insanely high and has been for months.
Time to go build a battlebot and try and win all my money back
Up 100% ish on SPY 370p 1/15, hold or sell?
dude the market is gonna collapse from its own weight. Senate going BLUE (which ive called and was downvoted to hell) the new strains will NOT be effective against the vaccine (which you see reports coming out as of last night) i was right u cunts. continue to down vote cunts

you buy when the vix is low? lol
Found the Proud Boy
Either buy CFII this cheap or top up averaging in,
AKA stop profit. Paper hands bitches.
They only go up, except when they don’t. I’m down 10% right now but unless SPY randomly crashes we have a month to climb. What are your put positions?
ICLN and TAN still green. Slightly.
2021 still better than 2020 

Idc how red it is so far let’s be thankful that shit is over

Normal. Baffles me when everyone calls a correction in the market a 2nd crash
can't believe I exited Fubo at the top. 300% on Leaps (bought 2 @ 10 USD each). 

1 win out of 100 shitty plays. Maybe I am good at this.
It is NOT safe to swim today.
B N G O goin' down but up 30% because of it today. I called it last week, should've made it a DD for y'all :(
Because nobody but the elderly want it
I know all of you are here because Slack is down, pretending like you can't work
When others cry you buy, unless your account has a margin call
Is “EATTTTTTT” bullish or bearish?
Vegas has the ga elections at 50-50. The market is scared of big tax increases if dems take over.  We had a big run up due to an expected divided govt, which was viewed as the most optimal outcome.  Throw in covid and slow vax rollout and here we are.

Why are people crying about Apple? It’s down not even 4%
Despite what most people think based on the media. The American people are way smarter than that. At least the ones with stonks
After the Georgia Senate elections I think we see  a rally larger than the one we saw after Biden’s win, and a rally that lasts longer than a couple days. 🚀🚀🚀
This is not correct
Yep. Sell or hold. Buying shares or calls is not advised at this time.
Looks like 2800 is on the charts soon
spent mine on blow this weekend
The list is insane. After reading a few of these articles I'm realizing how insanely angry this makes me. What can I do as a just 1 American? Already have been avoiding "made in China" products but holy shit man the Chinese government is filled with human trash in need of a cleanup

Never won shorting this shit before though so might just sell.
Nope, not bullshit. Just opened the account this morning and I think he money isn't there yet or something. I'm restricted from buying anything on RH for 90 days cause I went into a day trade call and placed another day trade before my deposit to get out of the day trade call had cleared.
Thank you for for dd and teddies my mothafuckin boyyyyy🚀🚀🚀🚀

Main reason as to why I don't invest in Chinese owned companies (or heavily influenced, etc) is a hedge against tensions between China and the world. Unless there is beneficial progress (socially, politically, etc) among China and the US (for example), there is no way to really tell what will happen. With potential de-listings, P&Ds, fraud, and obvious corruption, it's hard to justify putting money in there.

Great question fellow GME gang,

Facts: 
- Norway is a long time ally 
- Norway only needs to spend 0.01%, realistically they could spend 0.005% to achieve the same results 
- Norway specifically invests long-term companies and is ALREADY invested in GME and has 2.5% voting power
- Norway has a specific goal to “generate the highest possible return” 
- Norway is an active participant in shareholder voting  

With all of that in mind, Norway could partner with Ryan Cohen with the stipulation that Norway is the European center of the digital gaming transformation, partnering with Norwegian gaming, tech, and tourist companies while also hosting an annual gaming conference held in Norway. Huge boost to the Norwegian economy for a small one time $100m (0.01%)  increase to their already existing position
Bought the top

Oh shit, I forgot there is something called a stop loss
Just dump it overboard with the rest of the sewage.

This aged like fine wine, congratulations on your tendies sir💎
I don't think that XPENG is that stupid. They copied the code, but are probably not simply copy-paste using it. Not sure though... maybe they should built in some fail safes for situations like that. Like have it work, but randomly drive people to the tesla factory once a month lmao.
Yeah I think I’m gonna buy in rn

The expectation of the Stonk Plutocrats will be that Mitchy Mitch will hold the senate and gridlock Washington for the next 4 years.  The market wants a Biden administration of continual celebrations of female CEOs of color while all legislation sits on the sideline and money printer go brrr.

But the latest bullshit in Washington is seriously angering the meat bags of Trump's Kiss Army and they just may not show up to the polls.  The worry now is that the Dems, finding themselves with a super majority, will feel obligated to do something progressive or risk losing their base entirely.  The result will be some kind of modest healthcare reform or slight  tax increase on Russian Nesting Doll Yachts.

Until that headwind resolves, Stonks may  go negative up.

The market is just dipping on the uncertainty of the election in Georgia that will decide the control of the US Senate. It dipped before the Presidential. This is a 2 day dip Max.

“COVID is popping up in US, there may be lockdowns and you’re still going long”

It's primed for a good year at least. Their aviation division will naturally get a boost with the 737 back in action, healthcare will get a boost from the vaccine roll out, and they've done a lot to cut back on debt.  I'm optimistic, 13c 3/19. Maybe a bit bold though, it's a slow changing stock.

Oh fuck oh fuck oh fuck I bought a lot of 363/362 1/06 puts. Umm can there be a continuation of rug pull please
Probably not a good idea until end of week at earliest
Why do you think there will be a correction if the Republicans win a seat?

I don’t see any way that either party only wins one seat, it’ll be all or nothing.
OH nice ive been selling calls so we are good :) just bought some calls back today actually.

The question is why wasn’t it worth it. It’s obviously worth it for companies now and it’s not like they don’t have the money to spend just even as a fuck you. Something happened

The actual advice is to just buy indexes on dips. Don’t try to be a stock picker just because u/Cock’n’ballz69 said Palantir is going to $50 with three rocket 🚀 emojis

ICLN is the only safe harbor 2021 😢🙏🏼
All I’ve been here on CNBC is “so much money siting on the sidelines” so then there should be no reason why they don’t buy this dip today...

Retard plays aside. How good of a hold is NIO for 3+ years. I think the company has huge potential to compete directly with Tesla sales and they seem extremely eager to cooperate with U.S regulations
It can go to $23 as long as it goes to $35 right after ;)
you gotta know when to hold em

know when to panic sell

know when to run away

I feel like casinos are the ultimate "lipstick on a pig".

Georgia had two Senate races, the normal one and a special election. They also have a rule where if one person gets less than 50% of the vote, they have a runoff election. One election had the winners get like 30% because it was so split, the other was less than 50% by like a few hundred votes.

It's the only state with any Senate elections left, and if Democrats get 50 votes the VP will be the tie breaker.
Going to eat more shares! I'd be glad for a pop.

Bruh diamond hand that lol. You got 1.5 months why would you sell on this red ass day
I think BB is definitely the weaker of the 3. Sometimes the plots were just a little over the top and they made walter out to be a Big Boss killing major cartel members but then being outsmarted by a band of nazi hillbillies. No way in hell someone as smart as WW leaves that book in his bathroom. No way in hell the Mexican cartels family doesn't come after Walt and kill everyone he knows and loves. I'll put True Detective and MadMen over BB personally but it's definitely one of the best ever. Just some minor weak points. Oh and fuck Skylar and that stuttering gay bear of a son.
If they can last till the.

Would you advise getting out of JMIA or is this a normal free fall?

CRSR calls. Great entry point today.
Now that’s what I like to hear
Make sense... for some reason I thought when then it would be December. But that would make sense only if they incurred losses (which likely wasnt the case seeing as how stocks mooned). So instead they sold January to pocket profit in a ‘new’ year. Rip. But if that’s the case, this should go back up quite quickly?!
Dump it all into AAPL and sell CCs

Uhm. 90% of people had their taxes cut under trump. Try to use your brain big boy
The big banks and tech tried to put together a slush fund to create an in-house insurer which would help them reduce their reliance on outside companies to provide insurance for their employees. Basically manage care and negotiate rates on their own. It looks like the costs and savings probably were not worth it and they disbanded.
Doomer porn.
Except for the fact that 2017 tax breaks were gonna expire this year anyway

You mean the raises in the Trump tax cuts right?
And they still suck
Thank q kind sir!!!!

The Pity reddit reward made my day.
you sir are retarded
can't wait for all the "you are an idiot if you didn't buy the dip" "I told you so" "what are you even doing if you didnt buy on Monday"
The main reason I like it is because it was on the negative theta list all last week and just made the positive list. I also sell covered calls on all my positions and sometimes add covered puts. I prefer the odds in my favor.
Same with SPY calls EOD.
Found Future “Anal god” flair owner here
Ah thanks for the explanation. So if it’s full blue = more chance that Biden raises taxes or whatever gets through. If Georgia is red then there’s a sort of brake to not let things get too wild. Is Georgia the only remaining state? Or why is it ‘all on Georgia’ I could probably google but I think I might get a simpler explanation here

Yeah I don’t know how they are holding up. Even back in March all the ETFs had the same draw down of SPY. So much for growth funds being more volatile
This is a shitty way to start the year
Irrelevant and ignorant. Rally happened when senate republicans held. Taxes are going up in your fantasy world Hahahaha have fun with your losses bro bro
I don’t get it. I have PLTR options 26.5c 1/29. PLTR is up 1% and IV increased from about 100% to 110%. Theta decay should be priced in. Yet my option is down 30% right now.....
Buy high, sell low

🤡 gang at its best
Both companies are good, but TLRY is the better of the two in my opinion. I personally would go into TLRY from APHA
I was told Tesla inclusion would help SPY
Sell a cheaper put and make it a debit spread. This locks in profits without selling a position

Then use that money to buy more puts. Rinse, repeat. All day.
😍
Why go high risk/high reward when you can go high risk/low reward? Sell SPY put spreads expiring Wednesday, and max out your account as collateral.
Put my last penny into AMZN call spreads. Now we wait
PLTR signed 4 contracts back to back FDA 14.8M a year for 3 years, 113.8M renwal for a year with the military, 15.5M a year with the UK and now 22.5M with Japan. That's 166.6M with 4 contracts. They have 120 clients. 🚀🚀🚀🚀💎🖐

Our country is a failed state, it's obvious if you've been paying attention to the last 20 years. It's been lurching forward on fumes and massive QE money printing, that's all
at least my account is still up $40 today, I see that as an absolute win
The main reason I like it is that it was on the negative theta list all of last week and is now positive.
SPY really catfished and then cucked you all by showing ATH at 376+ premarket and now drilling to 365s ahahaha

Shaking off the paper bulls already huh

If the senate goes blue there’s likely to be a rush of gun sales bc the “dems” are gonna ban all guns.
But also stimulus will pass easily if it does go
Blue.  Win win or lose lose? Or win lose? Or lose win?

This is pre-poll jitters. Same thing happened in November. There’s some Iran-Israel fears mixed in for good measure, but Iran are probably not stupid enough to cross the line less than two weeks before Biden (who would be expected to be more reasonable than Trump) moves into the Oval Office. Seizing the South Korean tanker and leaking their uranium enrichment targets is a “look at what we can do, you better pay attention to us during your first week” play. 

So the main thing that will move markets this week is Georgia. Thing is after watching the markets through one Brexit referendum, endless UK Brexit drama, the following Uk general election and one US Presidential election I have firmly concluded that markets are **** at politics. I don’t know whether it’s the fact that traders don’t follow it or the algos aren’t programmed correctly or some other factor, but it’s clear that markets can’t properly price the likely outcome of political events - they either don’t interpret the data correctly or view the outcome as too binary or both. If the Democrats win then markets may react negatively in the short term, anticipating more tax rises and regulation of big tech before remembering that a majority of one doesn’t beat the filibuster and that an evenly divided Senate will revolve around moderate Republicans rather than the left of the Democratic Party.
Just watch out. I said that literally everyday last week
MT gang alive and thriving fucking lol. 🧲
I'm OOTL can someone explain what's going on?

As an insurance agent I can say I was a bit worried that Amazon was gonna handle medication as Walmart was gonna do in person health but now that they ditched it I’m Kinda worried it’s because we will get socialized healthcare for all and my job will be obsolete
Maybe. Maybe not. This could be the start,  elections are tommarow.
Apparently market thinks we'll all have our personal money taken from us and given monthly stimmy checks by the democrats or something 


This is a huge overreaction
you are the dumbest retard I've ever heard of
Sold a good portion above 100, made enough to cover my current position and then some profit. Playing with house money now.

Good for business because they don't get taxed into oblivion and taken over as government entities ultimately.
The Dems want to give 26% tax credit on your 401k contributions. I will literally max out my whole family's 401k accounts if it passes.

Democrat controlled House, Senate, and Presidency. And the ability to pass more of Biden's agenda (much of it involving renewable energy) than if they didn't have the Senate.
Sell options when IV is high and buy options when IV is low
yes, but what happened after the sell off retard?
$680 🐻
Where is SoftBank when you need them
Just enough to force close my x5.
Es gotta close above 3680 today IMO. It has been a critical pivot point the past several weeks and a close below could lead us lower.

Great way to start the year. I’m almost down all my gains from 2020. I guess it’s a fresh start?
idk I use ali express to buy cheap crap, amazon to buy crap of substance
what if this is actually just a healthy pullback
Revolut. I didn't expect such a violent pull down and set $18.6 limit buy on Sunday. I was maniacally pressing Cancel, but it didn't work. Then I got a notification a minute later that a buy order went through. The price was already around $18.3 by that point...

Oh well, I am convinced this is a $30 stock by March, but it still hurts not buying in the low $17s....
I just need to find 11,780 more dollars

It's not about what the democrats want it's what the majority of the country wants. This is a political issue now, meaning if you want to get relected you need to support it. Biden and Kamala didn't talk about it because they thought it would be cool. They did it to garner votes.

It fucking amazes me how much GME gets pushed around here. If you’ve been under a rock for the past 20 years, Gamestop is a shit business model that has slowly been eating itself alive. I rarely if ever see any positive press about it. 

So what if a new console came out? Who gives a fuck. Best Buy, Target, hell, every other big store name sells games. The new consoles are even trying to push digital games on us, so where does that leave places like Gamestop? I guess they can sell more Funko pops or some shit.

If you bought GME for any reason other than a quick pump and dump at the console release, then you are a fool.
TSLA is the exact same dogshit, ugly car manufacturer that was there at the beginning of 20 and end of 20. The 700% increase does not make any fucking sense. I make sure to make every TSLA owner I meet in person feel like shit for having such an ugly car. Imagine actually believing this shit is the future.

CEMEX is the only company that offers a net-zero CO2 concrete. They are also a multi-national company doing business with 50 nations. Leaders look to infrastrcutre spending a recession.

This is what happens when communists try stealing a democratic election
if I knew that I'd be a millionaire already lol. but typically seeing a 10% jump at open on a Monday morning is not the best time to buy in. watch it as the week goes on, more than likely youll see a dip back to baseline if not lower that you can buy in at if you think it'll jump up again. welcome to WSB by the way, hopefully you won't lose too much money here.
If SPY crashed to 220 I would nut so hard it would break the sound barrier

Flat rest of day.
"Something something, I'm gonna go broke." Close enough?

Buying OTM calls is what it feels like to chew Five Gum

First time? I eat 25% losses for breakfast, Daddy gonna sleep fine tonight regardless.
If you thought today’s drop was bad, just wait til tomorrow.

So I guess that was the top
Does ownership interest and the fact that its debt and not equity mean anything to you? It's not the same as apple doing an offering and the FED gobbling it up. Not even close
PTON is having supply chain issues. CRSR is a garbage company.
Fidelity you have to sign up for short lending.
Probably because it was up so much.
Because it’s a fraudulent company dog shit
*Jack Ma with his last breath*

'spy is fuk'
Die rcl die. U scam pos
because a garbage company without a product and revenue is worth about 3.50?

Account went up 50% on that AMD peak. Took profits and bought calls on the dip for SPY, AAPL, CRWD, and SBUX
Seriously ameripoors you're embarassing yourself
TSLA still green for you eh?

Except they recently rebooted it. If she doesn't know Rockapella, she's too young for you bro.

Doubt this lasts very long. Probably a sell off before the election tomorrow. Smart play was puts last week and calls are now on sale.
But they announced today they’ll continue the bond buying program?
Wow congrats 🍾!!
How's it working out?
Where did you get that info? Powell said they would continue to sustain the economy in anyway needed.
In US we can fund the opposition party. !
RKT below $20 is a guaranteed swing trade every time
You can buy and sell options like stocks. Buyers aren’t at risk of assignment the seller is but in your case think of it as you’ve offset the contracts you’ve bought by selling it to someone else (your right to but shares at X price has been given to someone else).
Everyone shitting there pants hold pussys..unless your in weeklies then you are retarded

 Called Broker (Fidelity) this morning to double check that my shares of GME are protected  and they said they don't loan equities from accounts less than 250k, but  i cant find anything about this anywhere and I'm wondering if they lied  to me. Mods deleted a similar post i had asking about this so thought id try here.

&#x200B;

TLDR:  Fidelity said they wont lend my GME shares, not sure if they lied.

&#x200B;

position: 800 shares
Well the problem is that I bought a lot of new positions this morning, which caused the world economy to crash and fuck me out of a lot of money.

I'm ready cash in hand.  When's the bottom to buy SPY?
[deleted]
best answer
No rally until I can buy a 3080.
a lengthy trip back to the time when John Stewart had an opinion on Cramer. It's a long video, but worth the trip back in time, and a very nice peek into Cramer's thin skin.

 [The Daily Show with Jon Stewart:In Cramer We Trust - Bing video](https://www.bing.com/videos/search?q=cramer+on+john+stewart+show&docid=607996829352266495&mid=9DB5C9BDB95403161CA39DB5C9BDB95403161CA3&view=detail&FORM=VIRE)
I’m going to partially disagree here.  The big problem is not going to be lack of python or PHP coders. I think there are even open source e-commerce solutions that can do 90% of what they need. 

The part they really need to get into is licensing.  Selling software over the Internet it’s not as easy as selling a pre-packaged pre-license box at a brick and mortar store. You need to have people who can negotiate and execute individual licensing and profit sharing plans with a lot of developers on a large scale. They are going to need to arrange a certain number of exclusive titles to attract new customers who don’t want to have yet another login account.  If they don’t have the ability to do that, their e-commerce site is going to fail.  

TLDR: If they don’t have the capability to pull new revenue streams out of intellectual property management, they are just going to enter it as another competitor in a Red Ocean industry and lose.
I didnt play the senate pump and dump well. Bought amd at 90 sold at 92 cause it didnt go up, so i missed out on that. Similarly, sold vxx covered 19c at 17 and now its worth triple had i waited. im back in amd now that it hit 91 again. Wasnt sure enough to buy a put all i had to do was close out and not look for 2 hours
It’s times like these I am blessed to have a real job (manager at Wendy’s)

Good times
I’m not a bear and I have no puts or shorts, but if I’m being honest, this chaos is kind of fun sometimes
It seems difficult to me to rank different systems within a single level of autonomy, since their focuses are different. Personally i think Waymo is ahead, demonstrated by their confidence to have cars truly drive autonomously transporting people, and thus assume liability, while Tesla seemingly still isn't confident in their system in that way. Either way Level 5 is SO FAR off that it's not really sensible to base speculations based on either of those companies having Level 5 autonomy imo.

What the hell happened, y’all?
ya no shit. There were idiots on wsb talking about how it would be bullish for the market if Dems win both seats.  The market was pricing in about a 10% possibility, now its closer to 40%. Its going to be blood everywhere if they win both seats.

Jim Cramer has no respect for this thing. He's never bought FDs, not really. Here's a guy who stepped over his own boomer audience to grab the big seat. I'm embarrassed. I let him pump WSB last Christmas, and I took his fat, fuckin' hand in friendship.

The real question is does he stay missing or just turn up dead?

All in on TSLA 09/11 340P, sell the 8th, then TSLA 09/18 435C, sell the 15th. No need to go further, i'd probably have enough to build a fucking dividend portfolio!
No problem 😂

some say it's because of uncertainty from the Georgia runoff election, some say people are profit-taking in the new year since they won't have to pay taxes until the end of the year. I think its just a red day for no reason, buy the dip

Some people really forget the fear and uncertainty that caused the March crash. 

1.) People had been calling for a crash for *years* and the big correction in 2019 made a lot of hands weak. 

2.) The first videos out of Wuhan were horrifying. Bodies in the streets, people collapsing while walking, doctors and nurses breaking down and crying. The virus was likely a far deadlier strain at this point that no longer exists. 

3.) Virtually nothing is known about this mysterious and terrifying virus that appears to be beyond containment. 

3.) China shut down entire cities during their biggest holiday. That showed the entire world could shut down, for an indefinite period of time, with no plan of action. 

4.) unprecedented global shutdown of travel

5.) Surprise there’s also a  fucking oil price war


This is what causes circuit breakers. They don’t just happen randomly.
This scenario would kind of be ironic. The Dems only win one Senate seat tomorrow (Warnock), leaving the GOP with a 1 seat majority. Eventually, all the GOP senators will catch COVID if we follow the timeline below, leaving their majority at risk if one of them gets really sick and has to resign.

ok, that was a nice shakeoff
Not a chance. From my point of view, he’s looking to correct the super corruption that occurred. That’s irrelevant to the market though. Georgia could flip and Trump would still lose. It’s the economics and taxes of the Democratic agenda. Very different than past Democrats, even Obama.

You know those days where you look at your portYOLiO and wonder what happened to your last few brain cells? Everywhere you look, red dildos. You start feeling a sick sense of arousal and realize you are either retarded and gay or just a masochist. You have an internal battle with yourself, and start jerking off with sandpaper while choking on your favorite ball bag. After the tears start flowing and you can't go any longer you punch yourself in the face with a can of twisted tea and double down on your plays as you fade out of consciousness? Yeah) Glad I'm not the only one.!

That's def part of it and helped me realize the general woman hate that many possess.

It's also because the switch to full on selfish evil is written so well.  Ever all been kicked by life like Walter (or know someone who has been) and you really are rooting for him.

Then, it's like looking back and realizing how far you've fallen.

Even the small bit if redemption at the end when he saves Jesse isn't enough to get him out of the villian role.

Pretty orderly sell off. Fortunately, we’ve seen this before in the summer. Unfortunately, that means it is just getting started. Will be buying the dip, just not quite yet.

Cool bro post it again
Bears in lambos, bulls in brambles!!!
Yes.  It will also open your eyes to a world you (probably) have never been a part of.  I lived in Baltimore for a few years (around 2000-2003) and the little things the writers got right about the city is on par with how the writers of Mr Robot got hacking right.

The Wire also launched almost every person on the show into a huge acting career.  

There's a scene when the two main cops literally walk a crime scene and only say "Fuck" and it works.  The interconnected seasons show how everyone and everything is somehow related.  The way the series ends shows how nothing really changes.

It's rediculously good.

While not as good (it doesn't age as well), Is also recommend OZ as it was the first series HBO did that launched all the others.  Plus, Christopher Meloni as a neo nazi sadist is pretty remakable.  It also has a ton of other folks who ended up on SVU as well.
still buying the dip?

Guys, chill, not every day can be a GME up 20% day (unfortunately). Just zoom out the chart to cover more than the last two weeks, gain a bit of perspective. 

If you don't have calls ending imminently or getting margin called, why worry?
Just gonna keep decreasing my limit prices until I’m too late

It would super easy. We've gotten Americans to lock themselves in houses and do the limbo and even give up their jobs to avoid coronavirus.

If they fear china as much as they fear the coronavirus, they'll throw money at the problem.

The issue is China has large stakes in most of our media (and politician's retirements) so that nobody is starting the fearmongering. In fact, many on both sides are doing the opposite and pretending like china is our friend.
I'm such a fucking retard. Bought NIO 52C EOW right at the top.
Why would we be green? No stimulus on the horizon, no new vaccine news on the horizon, looks like Dems will take senate majority, nothing but bad Covid news now (vaccinating begins, large population declining vaccine including health care workers, and post-holiday Covid peak anticipates between 1/7-21)
every damn day: green off the bat and I go back to sleep.  wake up and i'm even.  gonna finish red.
Hey, you got it buddy!! Nothing like a hesitant, non-guaranteed stock information post to help my brothers. 

Would it be better if i used rockets and fire and swore j&j would make me a billionaire or i’ll tattoo my face? Lolololololololololook
wow and it's not even 4 yet
I will never financially recover from this
My friend does that. Never understood it. He says you can spread your cheeks better but I don’t buy it.
That's actually a good point; didn't even think of the regulation implications.
Best dip to buy right now ?
Let's wipe out the retards with a circuit breaker day

Yup.
I don’t understand how the market has a 2 week delay reaction to things

I'm in for the whole roller coaster. Check me out:

Cash out 70% of brrrrrrr and reinvest the other 30% into 1/2023 calls. 

Stocks go 🚀🚀🚀🚀 on Banking bill passage. (~6 months, with dem senate)

Stocks go 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 when we get national medical marijuana. (2-3 years, with dem senate) 

Stocks go 🚀💸🚀💸🚀💸🚀💸🚀 with federal legalization. 

Just wait till papa Bezos becomes the pablo escobar of online Marijuana. Brrrrrrrrrrrrrruh, do you have any idea how much that alone would raise AMAZONs market cap? 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Rockets loading, get on fam 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Today is not that day

When u overreact this way, u panic sell, and fomo into stocks at ATH for a loss

U remind me of this hot actress I know. She call me last night, cryin. I'm about to turn 30, Chuck. It's over for me. I'm worthless. I was like, OK, I happen to know u r in an extremely hyped movie coming this year. So lemme guess. When that comes out u will think u in the bling ring. U will be posting rich kids of instagram style photos and braggin constantly. Have u tried being normal, and not anchoring ur self worth to an inevitably fluctating currency?

Have modesty. Be calm. And u can date models like me.
vxx puts?
AAPL is absolutely murdering me. Make it stop! Make it stop!!!!

Idk but Rolls Royce (biggest airplane engine manufacturer ) took a big fat dump today, down 2k in 2 hours.
There’s something to be said for crowdsourcing
Lol your puts are printing but what are you right about here? Spy hit all time highs. You said it’s gonna drill Bc the stocks don’t like dems and socialism and some other dumb shit. This drill has nothing to do w that 🤡 congrats on your puts tho. I’ll give you that.
I think it's going to break 366 very soon.  And I also think we will be fucked more tomorrow when Europe sees this and sells off tonight/tomorrow.
Closed so positions so I have cash for tomorrow. Open positions are DIS 3/19 140p, SPY 3/19 300p and SLV 2/19 26c. Honestly who doesn’t like making money on puts? So much more fun than calls

KOSPI +2.5% extending the recent break out move violently to the upside. Korea remains one of the top indicators when it comes to the state of the global economy.

Japan on the other hand underperformed after PM Suga spoke of possibly declaring a state of emergency for the Tokyo area as virus cases surge.

> Kind of like the Russian oligarchs who are all criminals, but as long as they stay out of politics, the government leaves them alone.

China varies in that businesses are inherently political. You can't be leading a company while also staying out of politics. All that would do is signify you're on your own to the factions within the party that matter. You stay in good standing, you pay those above you and support them, and in return they turn a blind eye to a lot of less-than-legal dealings. If things become newsworthy or you step out of line they can decide to enforce the laws you've been breaking all along. It's a powerful tool for those in charge when everyone is guilty of something.
so does the market want republicans or dems to win senate?
Go with GRWG instead

honestly, probably the political uncertainty.
200 support is 366ish which is where it seems to be hanging.  If it breaks, we could be looking at 360ish which is the 50.  If it breaks that then it goes negative.

For March or June, $40 - $42 are fine.  June you could probably even get away with 43 or 44.
That’s all we can do in the sea of blood
What to do with bngo
What the hell. No large limit buy orders on L2 quotes for SPY until $360... GUH.
Yeah, well, if you were in the market in March and didn't smash every dollar you had into ETFs and airlines and cruiselines and etc, you're certified retarded, in hindsight.
Big Tech down perhaps on possibility of regulation, eco/weed stocks up?
Hard to say exactly. If both Dems win then a 2k stimmy is much more likely. But markets might not like the prospect of higher taxes
What does that have to do with the weed stocks

Just realized I have gay shares for 11 different spaqs. I only own shares of 4 companies that aren't spaqs, plus a handful of the arks. Probably shouldn't diversify so much. Positions: CRSR 2/19 exp. $40/45 CDS, FCEL 1/15 exp 10/12 and 13/14 cds. Only the 10/12 is currently green lol
Place your buys and close your eyes
If i buy the dip today, did i buy the dip or another top?

I love how WSB embraces uses of emojis unlike other gay parts of Reddit. 👀
Not yet
I bet is not so much about governments but businesses, I don't think Apple would be cool about not being able to produce shitty phones to sell to the masses. And that's just one example.
There’s a lot of red :/
Well, a lot of you lunch drive-thru employees are waking up and getting ready to go to work. Good news, your life has not gotten worse. Bad news? You gotta wear that Wendy's hat again.

Nothing is difficult in hindsight...

Yeah 5% dump and down 1k on my calls.. the fuck. any idea whats the catalyst for this?
Don’t worry.  Our 80-90 year old politicians are on top of any and all economic issues.

Apparently vulgar words are now banned across Reddit. Damn woke society.
Competition disappearing is clearly bearish

You know how they say buy the dip? Look at AAPL. Now do as Warren would.
I bought the top and the top won
thank u 🙏🏽
I had my share of fun in college & through my 20s. Ultimately as my responsibilities grew as an adult I realized I can't afford to lose a career advancement over some weed. I got laid off in the fall and was very fortunate to find a better job offer in 1-2 months. The whole time I was mostly nervous about that pee test.

I managed to pass the test and pledged I would stop smoking so I could focus on what matters most to me in life. That being the overall well being of myself and loved ones who are depending on me more as I get older.
Are we looking the same chart? Last time I checked the dip means retards are selling 😂
At least I don't feel like WeBull is actively trying to rip me off like RH is.
What happened to APPLE?
in other news:  goverments, sponsored by Dupont chemical pesticides and the fast food industry continue to assure fat americans that eating crap plays no role in susceptibility to illness.
This makes sense
Oof
The jokers in the Bloomberg "Markets are falling over concerns of a coronavirus surge"
Nah don't think so much. The big boys took profit past three weeks and the usual dip buyers really cannot afford supporting this fucking price level.
You could try to time out some VXX puts - SPXS or SQQQ for a quick scalp.
And they will be, once GME price will get there.
sorry guys bought a call. market always inverses me
Webull cucked me and now I will just diamond hands
Yeah I picked up a couple weekly $18.50's about 10 minutes ago...

I could do this all day. 

Jk, please stop falling.

Selling off due to multiple reasons

&#x200B;

2. " PFIZER SAY THERE IS NO DATA TO DEMONSTRATE THAT PROTECTION AGAINST COVID-19 FROM THEIR VACCINE IS SUSTAINED BEYOND 21 DAYS AFTER FIRST DOSE "

Real talk tho how much can I get enhanced
You're literally doing things in reverse. Buy on red days, sell on green. If you don't get green, then fucking hold and average down. If you can't average down, then just fucking hold.
As long as you guys aren't bagholding trash stocks like GME, you'll be fine.
FUBO ANNOUNCE THE BETTING NOW
Betting odds have shifted to Warnock being a favorite and Ossof being a pick'em with early voter turnout numbers.

Perdue was a heavy favorite and Loeffler a slight favorite before voter turnout numbers...

That being said; if Senate goes blue does it affect the stonk market? If so, to the upside or downside?
It do go down!
Yeah, if you were overleveraged in short dated calls, I'm really sorry :(

what’s his paper hand threshold
I declare bankruptcy!
WSB has turned into a p&d on meme stocks the past couple months. WAAAAAAY too much of this sub is overleveraged in shit like GME, which is getting **throttled** today.
Because of the delevearging that has to occur when people get margin called.
I lose money every trade and only buy FDs on meme stocks can I get a flair now?
yea you need to file taxes.
the accredited investors that have been locked in for 6 months are selling. people are saying the low could be 11.5 but will recover soon.
Days like this will fucken MURDER your calls. It will now take a shit load of green days to break even.

steel daddy dont let me down
🍎 GUH
I still think PLTR could dip a bit more, referring to the MACD, especially if the lock up ends. Your thoughts? But I am looking for a solid entry point, I believe in PLTR.
I am going to start buying the dip at 3 %.
Averaged down hard today. Set aside a bit more as we may see 17 or 16 this week if there no catalysts. Stay strong and diamond hands GME Gang or you are gonna regret it

Too bad you didn’t read my post oh well literally your lose.

Alright you fucking boomers lunch is served, eat this fucking dip
What are my fellow BNGO bros thinking for a target price? It's looking juicy enough to load up on a second helping of shares.
Market had no reason to rally, it’s correcting.
You cannot even buy DFEN. BA is dragin' it down.
How far do we think SPY will drop eod?

Ok Boba. It’s really not tho. This is the pump while the rest of the market begins to dump. Then this’ll dump.

The meme quality has increased lately
This is actually how I lost money on palantir:

Bought at 29.1, sold at 28.3
Bought again at 26, sold at 25
Bought again at 25.4, sold at 23.2
And I'm still tempted to buy back in 😂

All shares btw, from 53k to 45k 🔙🔙🔙
Goodbye Apple
Already balls deep
Damn that's tough, would probably hold but it's a tough call
Enjoy your tendies.. there's possibly going to be a dip towards the end of Feb, might be a good time to sell out, if it dips buy back in otherwise find the next play..
A small amount of them, but its still over 100% shorted and has less available to borrow every week. People are keeping up with short stats pretty closely and they are not going down very much at all.
Dude you need to get outside more and off the internet lol. Most places aren’t gonna shut down cause the government said so. The virus does 100x less damage than extended shut downs. Use your brain. And I have worked on the vaccine that does work
Holy shit QS 😳 RIP
If tsla drops, spy is done
God damn this marker sucks
am I understanding this correct?

- tech is correcting because it expects both dems to win
- weed stocks up ~5% in anticipation of this aswell

is this right? then why do fuck is GRWG, my only weed stock down 4% aswell?
I feel attacked
Waited all long weekend for this bullshit
SPY was the play last week and today.
Shares are the way to go.
Yeah... didn’t think it was gonna break 130 but here I am bagholding a feb/March callas hoping earnings will be insane
PROUD CALLS STAND BACK AND STAND BY 😰

You get exposure to the equivalent of 50 shares of SPY per MES option. Just trade SPY options

Not sure about the US, in Canada it's only work earnings that matter for that.
Oh wait shit I didn’t even check the name. Hey big bro 👋
Oh shit

On the bright side 

I get to wear my dow 30000 hat again later when we go green.
NIO saving me today, don't know why I bought more of Tim's AAPLs instead of dumping more money into NIO/TSLA. I know he is good for it after earnings but still.
No cash, because we can’t sell the PLTR calls we bought at the top for an 80% loss
[deleted]
Apple this hurts lol I’m long but fuck
Can't wait for tomorrow's DCB.
That’s what I’m doing, but this sub instantly turned into a bear den
The market has only been open 2 and a half hours so far.
Spy holding pattern at 367 before we reach 364
it means the eventual crash / pullback will be much less. However short term there might be a quick drop
Markets need to BACK THE FUCK UP,   
RED IS ILLEGAL, GO GREEN
It is an odd moment when PLTR is actually dragging your portfolio upward
Good thing there's a second dose...

The direction on Monday is always what I had expiring last Friday
If the house had dropped 10% I would live in it and go to work. Houses are housing, not investments. I lived there, that was the point. I didn't log into a dashboard evey day and jerk off about the value of my house. Houses are just a way to turn rent into something that might turn out better, not a call option, and no one sells into a shit market unless they have to.

Edit- you really don't understand the most basic concepts of mortgages, do you? You don't have to pay anything to anyone when your house "loses 10%" LOL. It's a fixed payment. The cost of ownership is the same for 30 years, even if the house loses 50% of its value or appreciates 300%

Then you are good! Buy more and average down. The fundamentals of the spac hasnt changed. It's just a market wide sell off. This is when you buy in cheap of things that you may have been targeting.

Not bagholding buddy. Got a 12C 11/21 contract that's up a few hundred bucks and 284 shares at an average of 17 dollars. Sold a CSP at 24 which I'm.confident won't get exercised. I'm long and hard on palantir like your wife's bf is inside her.

I never said you said it was a foolproof strategy either, but you did say it was free money.  Just helping temper expectations, and of course, hindsight is 20/20.
Sorry in advance. I make roughly 20k a year at work but made less than 50k trading. Do I need to file taxes? If I am making profits trading,  can I still collect unemployment?

bad idea. wait until after the conference at least
buy the $GPS dip, hold til at least march, kanye west ⛷
You want to know why I’m bearish? Because all year we have been hearing that Biden would handle the outbreak better, he becomes president in a few weeks. The virus is spreading like crazy right now, he will shutdown the country. I was at the airport yesterday, so many people are still traveling. Do with that what you will. My positions: spy puts, ZM calls, VIXY calls (all dated a couple months out.) This will be my last comment on the matter cause I don’t want to be called out for fear mongering, just trying to help you guys out.
They’d have to install nets on every building higher than 3 stories if the market dropped 15%.

Went from +100% to -40% in a week with QS
They brought us right back down to December VWAP like it was nothing time to bounce.
Loading more up tomorrow when I'm able to!🚀🚀🚀
If it is then it will only be slightly green. I think the markets are panicked about the U.K. announcement at 8pm GMT. Once they know what it will be everything should be more stable tomorrow.

prob not as bad as some, only down like -4K rn
Red days build character.

It is known.
Question regarding the $15.00 put option on SWI (SolarWinds) for 1/15/2021.  Sold a put a couple weeks ago, and noticed the price very rarely moves regardless of the stock price. Assumed at first it was just low liquidity, but decided to try and close my position anyways since it is slightly in my favor. The bid never goes through. Thought it was just robin hood being robin hood, but noticed on several sites, there are no bids or asks for that option. Yet I put in the ask this morning, and still never shows in the bid book.

Any ideas, why a particular strike price on an option would not be updating bids/asks.
Yes

Please god no
Yes
not a chance in hell

NIO Day is Jan 9. It will run up to $62+ by then, and most likely moreso the n NIO day but you could sell at market open for a safe bet.

Better. It's like the only cop show that has likeable police protagonists while also showing how fundamentally broken the law enforcement system is.

I was told SPY only goes up. I want to speak to the manager and get a refund
Yeah now that they added strikes above $40 on options it’s not nearly as spendy.
Honestly bro if u wanna make cash like that Tesla
It’s even better than Breaking Bad.
I made 46.4% last year in gains. I did the math guys, if I keep this up for 20 years straight, at a more modest 30% gains, I'll have over $100 million.

So is it wise to BUY Sompo stocks? If they have 20% of Palantir, then its undervalued. Am I correct or am I retarded?

I’m cool with that too.

It is a waste unless you have a lot of shares.  You are pissing away gains
And I never said it was a foolproof strategy, just buying long dated calls on ETFs obviously won't always pay out, but in a high performing sector with plenty more room for growth an ETF is a safer way to play exposure.
Depending on the expense of the house and where you live, buying a house can actually be financially stupid move when you factor in all the non-equity building payments on a yearly basis and the opportunity cost of the downpayment.

Fubo going to 0 or what?
Do you know anything about the company? Stocks don’t just randomly “bounce back” because they’ve gone so far down. The company has no product with a lot of competitors right now. QS is ultra promising with the team behind them, but the only way it’s gonna “bounce back” is if whales are getting involved for pump and dump games, which are 100% unpredictable. Without pump and dumps, QS wouldn’t be making a come back until it finally delivers a product, which can be several years from now.
just logged in, green in both accounts. niceeeee
Maybe in 2025 when they have a product
2 business days. He files a form 4.
Read that the phase 1 biotechs are now being evaluated at 2x historic average.

This also applies to penny stock pump and dumps. 

1~6 billiion spacs are new penny stocks.

That QS and FUBO dump is borderline criminal. 

Not even NKLA dumped like that.
Are you sure that's what you appreciate about me
Its basically like buying insurance in black jack.  Is an important thing for traders and institutions but retail buy and hold not so much.

Selling that POS for break even is the best decision I ever made

Well timing the bottom wouldn't have been difficult in retrospect. I started trading actively in August, this was bought early September. So not not LEAP, but whatever.

just ease in...
It’ll break thru by tomorrow or wednesday
For it to be a LEAP, you'd have to have bought it right around March/April... meaning you literally timed the bottom.  This isn't necessarily a foolproof strategy moving forward.
Did you see Jack Ma back there too?
Ya but is it sustainable?


Find out next time on **DRAGON BALL Z**
Set it and forget it.
I’m in LEAPs, woke up late, totally fucked.
FUBOttom nowhere to be found
It will close below 24.5 today and take another huge dip tomorrow.
UVXY printing very nicely and keeping me in the green while GME tanks
It's gonna literally be impossible to bounce "back" soon

The bounce is gonna be from 9.50 to 12 or so, speaking as someone who's bagholding 200 shares at 19

I really can't see any announcement justifying a bounce back to 17+

Meanwhile I'm just gonna keep losing money forever. So cool
ALL IN NIO
i dunno...im just asking if its worth it to do?
I said it last week and I'll say it again this week. My lender told me he can lock me in for 2.375% on a conventional 30 yr. Go out and buy a house and when you pay that off, buy another one.
Way more than that, retard
When will we see a QS bounce back? It's been hammered for 4 days straight and down the biggest today at 37%.
Why?
Lmao my poor 3300c
yes, very
tsla cannot dip below 732 wtf
If you're in on shares you're good fam. Hold until retirement

If it misses, you keep the cash, if it hits you got out...

I’m really really broke so I could only afford a 2/5 150c call think I could make it w first solar I can always sell it for a profit just wondering if it might reach that by the 5th of February
The previous 200% was a top at any point too it’s not a bad play tbh
Bought the spy dip and it kept on dipping
Investors tend to prefer gridlock between House and Senate since it means things stay mostly the same and therefore things are more predictable.

I doubt we see a crash if the Dems win, but certain stocks will pump (weed, clean energy, EV) and others will eat dirt (big tech).

This may be a sell-off leading into elections like we saw the week prior to the main election slate. A hedge to prepare for the outcome. Dems are polling well but there really is a skew towards republicans that's rarely accounted for in polls.

My guess is things will bounce back later this week. Senate majority hangs in the balance tomorrow so it's pretty tense so it doesn't surprise me that we're seeing a selloff.
That volume is fucking outrageous at 346 million
Interesting. I'm fearful of selling off tsla and nio because I feel they'll still go up long term. On the otherhand, I can pay off my credit if I just wipe my hands clean and sell everything.
Shares at 50, checking in
XPEV: whatever happens stock is flat or bleeds.

TSLA: literally does nothing, Elon farts. TSLA +82700% how is this normal.

Not a gay bear tho but this is just crazy.
I sold for a small loss. Might buy back into a cheaper call tomorrow.
That's the spirit. I'm probably gonna uninstall the app once it's all set up.

i keep buying the dip but i still can't get past this level...
Fuck this nonsense, i'm buying a Sheep farm, Wool's a fucking scam, it shrinks the minute you wash it, my new jumper is hilariously tiny now, it's just a steady stream of guaranteed replacements.
Yea, I’m down 6% not a big deal
Most of what they do should be illegal. I actually cannot think of why it is legal to front run your short positions when you are at the level of exposure that Citron is at.
No. Keep buying lol
My TSLA calls went to 0% profit after the morning pump as per usual (got up to 60%)

Market down 1.5%

Time to switch teams 😎

Your rationale is incorrect.
$GOLD call.

market seems to be trending downward.. not BTFD
Buying at the top lol where have you been
What the fuck happened to all the pre-Eisenhower politicians? The ones that had ideals greater than self enrichment and had a, perhaps quixotic, belief in something greater than themselves like a global project of maximizing human well being and positive world building? The kind that would have gone to war with the Sinos 20 years ago before it got even a tenth as bad as it is now, rather than getting in bed with them, committing economic treason for a comfortable retirement? Where do we find *great men* again?
Correct the gop has a better chance at getting senate seats in latino places like new mexico if they compromise a little on illegals. When it comes to voting  Black Americans put the greatness emphasis on race in my opinion
I'm holding it forever, so ... idk ?
AMZN always gets hit the hardest
Robinhood has 2.5% margin
LUV, RTX, BA, RCL/NCLH if you believe in cruises, etc.
I’m in NEE FSLR as well it’s doing gr8 rn and CPK and AMRC
man, work would really suck if i couldnt check my positions constantly
I love buying at the top

Pltr up, my calls down another 15%.
Which one?
Tfw you wake up late and were going to all in on puts at open
Nope, the more retarded my play the more I feel at home here.
all related to the Georgia senate race
Georgia runoffs?!
today: Nope.
I don’t know but being down 50% on LEAPs is serious issue. Not to mention the shares down 40%. Just wow. Why research a company even?? A Seeking Apha article tanks this stock.... what do I even know? Nothing. Which is what my investment is now worth too.
You think trumps gonna stay 4 more? 🤡 🤡

Sounding like r/China which is much better then sounding like r/sino
There’s no real good answer, it honestly depends on how much $3,500 affects your life rn. An easy rule of thumb is that if it’s good enough to want to screenshot, it’s time to take some profits.

Me hungry this morning: I'm gonna buy MCD calls
Me now: wtf
If SPY gives up 368.... I’m going to watch the carnage lol
It's not a pump and dump, it's someone young coming in and showing all signs he will turn a dying company around. Is it risky? Yeah. Is it a pump and dump? No.
Draftkings about to flip green.
That’s so smart but especially with these EVs they seem to dip to hit stop losses before second leg up.
Jesus Christ it gets more exaggerated by the day... Let's be clear here, there has been no direct evidence of "killing", and the Uyghur population of Xinjiang can't support a "scale larger than the Holocaust".

A word of rationality here: By all credible evidence, China is running ideological re-education institutions and some Muslim populations in Xinjiang have been forcibly enrolled,. The ethics of this is obviously debatable, but accusations of "genocide" have no backing. I know this sub is for retards but as investors it's probably wise to be picky with information. Don't get stuck in an echo chamber.
Welcome to the club
Do markets like stimulus? Because if Dems win, Mitch is out and we’re all getting $2000

NIO, MT, SQR,ICLN, PLTR, AMD are all up. There are other stocks than GME or TSLA.
Fair enough, I should probably hold off from sending my money to a firm in the Bahamas as well.

I‘ll be using DeGiro for my options trading as a EU resident, as they are a legit broker. Just make sure to apply for the active profile in order to gain access to derivatives. They‘re not fully commission-free, but have very low comissions on most products and are based in the Netherlands.

I made this comment a week or two ago: despite its meteoric runnup that created even more WSB millionaires than TSLA, GME is still worth just about 1/2 of Luckin Coffee today, not pre-scandal

Take it as a positive or a negative

March 40P is insanely cheap.
Full disclosure: I’m not an expert. Make sure you do your own research before making financial decisions. This is just my take. I’m in on UVXY calls short term and GME long term.

Edit: if I had more time and equity, I’d be looking at shorting traditional healthcare that will suffer from new regulation. Going bullish on guns, weed and green energy.
From the beginning this has always been a 💎🙌 operation. FWIW, we will not go below $16.00.

Looking forward to hitting 25 next week!
I’ve been burned on APHA FDs before but yeah, I still think they’d probably be the best bet for a quick pop if legalization looks likely. I think green energy is still the better play in the case of a blue senate though because of the likelihood for a green energy infrastructure bill to facilitate economic recovery.
Barely lol. 0.79%
I'm not selling this until atleast mid march. I only glance at it to get a nut off, then forget it exists after the post kicks in

I mentioned this earlier:
"It was hit pretty hard by shorts which caused selling. Checking iBorrowDesk there was 350k shares available to short, at the low it was down to 150k shares available. 200k shares shorted this morning."

This is the reason for the huge dip, shorts are really trying to get shareholders to sell out of their positions.

There's enough catalysts for January alone to support buying in.
Thats why I slept in and trusted the play

It works every time. Sell your $MT calls at open and buy ITM or ATM puts. It seems to always bleed after open. Then switch back to calls eod. Once the earnings are near I suppose holding the calls is the right move though.

Ive made almost no progress in my account the past month or so. All the swings in gains and losses to basically just come out even. Going all cash would have produced the same result without the overcomplications. Why do I even play this game anymore.
So all my stocks are already down by 20-30%, this means that when the market crashes my stocks will stay flat and wait, right?
That's the inverse - when longs get squeezed.

All I see is blank. Not to dissimilar to my own account
A unified party across Pres/HoR/Sen means extreme power in both lawmaking and execution. Imagine what big boys are going to do when tax rates, regulation and healthcare all change in the first two years. The market likes checks and balances; a unified government removes a lot of that security. It’s gonna be spicy. That is until economist start reporting that is good because of stimulus. It’s deflates the dollar, but bolsters GDP according to the past 75 years.

Tough call. If Repubs take senate in GA ICLN may very well dump. If Dems take it though we’ll at least see support if not hopefully a small bump up. Your 1/15 depends almost entirely on near term politics IMO.

*”Still Waitin’ on that short squeeze” GME shares*

*”Gonna moon any day now” PLTR calls*

*The Premium FD, an assortment of weekly SPY calls that are guaranteed to expire worthless*


I don’t think I’m hungry today.

It was hit pretty hard by shorts which caused selling.  Checking iBorrowDesk there was 350k shares available to short, at the low it was down to 150k shares available.  200k shares shorted this morning.
Reasons to be bearish: High profit taking cause of new tax year, new Covid strain and Euro lockdowns, overbought market

Reasons to be bullish: Stocks only go up

Here is some articles for my 'asspull statement'

https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/09/ps5-retailers-have-many-fewer-digital-edition-systems-for-pre-order/


A source at one major UK retailer said their company's stock allocation had been around 25 per cent Digital Edition versus 75 per cent regular PS5, though this might vary slightly from store to store.


https://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2020-09-21-playstation-5-digital-edition-stock-far-lower-than-standard-ps5-sources-say

Quote from above article:

Other sources claimed the ratio was even higher, with ratios around 20 per cent Digital Edition to 80 per cent regular PS5 suggested.

Wait till WeD and buy the dip
As a newbie, i know exactly what to do.

1)  Get margin from your broker (basically free money) so you can spend it

2)  Spend it on calls for TSLA

3)  Wait a few weeks

4)  Get more money.

Yes.
It was going well untill the general market selloff kicked in and then both amd and nvda went from moon to drill, now barely positive for the day... Frustrating to say the least but at least the are doing better than the nasdaq again for once so maybe that's a good sign for the rest of the week.
Sorry guys, but SPY is gonna dip more it seems

I dunno was thinking of real estate for inflation and its somewhere to park cash.
It’s a decade play. Very speculative. But could pay off handsomely if you get in at the right price in shares. Options aren’t dated long enough
I don’t think it’s prices w the democratic win also invest in first solar it’s starting to do numbers

It’s video game blockbuster
QS is the stupidest shit ever.  This was bound to happen.  Y'all shit on Nikola, yet QS is the same shit and doesn't even have a product to sell. It won't sell squat until 2024, and isn't even expected to sell $1B until 2027. That's assuming they have a product of course.

Hacking people's accounts from an Infosec perspective is about piecing bits of information together to provide a plausible facade of ownership and impersonate them. You're supposed to keep shit like this secret for a reason.
Buy dip trust me, sell fluff because new tax year, tommorow is green
All depends on how you think tomorrow will turn out.

Holy fucking shit stock twits is a bunch of fucking retards who know absolutely nothing about the stock market. Hop on for daily comedy
I don't see anything about when they're announcing results this week. Plus with the delays in vaccine rollouts and competition in the space, it seems investors are hesitant given how the stock has dropped so much the last few sessions.
I fucking TRIPLED DOWN

Listen pal, I know you're a Papa Elon fanboy, but this isnt elementary school. You dont get marks for participation. This is a fucking casino. You either keep your promise, or you dont. Papa Elon didnt. Stocks that have a run up like TSLA dont maintain their momentum by missing targets when their competitors are hitting them.  

Good luck chief, you're gonna need it.

so are we buying the dip or all in on puts?

Hold GME tight and don't let go (don't let go)
You have the right to lose control (don't let go)
guys, day trading is how you blow up your account. wether your buying calls puts or shares try to have a time frame of at least 1-2 months, it’s way more successful
Thoughts on SPY $380c 1/13 exp?
What you see is 1 person post a win like that, but what you don't see is the 1,000+ people who did not post their loss.

Use to FOMO a lot then realized how stupid it was. There’s literally a play to make money EVERYDAY. Missed the train to tendie town? There’s another one leaving in 15 min. Stop buying PLTR at 33 or GME for the 4th time before it drops back down to 17
JUST BUY THE DIP

i mean here it is, we'll probably rally SPY and QQQ the rest of the month

Imagine thinking the start of one of the steepest declines seen since March is 'the dip'.
Sell low.
GME gang confirmation bias- papa Cohen bought at 16. That’s a nice floor.
I guess it depends on what classifies as smartphone. For me a phone of which half the surface is a plastic keyboard doesnt really classify as smart. 

If we dont say Apple invented the smartphone, i guess we can agree it revolutionized it. The first iphone was a giant leap compared to anything that existed. And this is why I hold apple till the end of time. Its the company that can come in a market where others have been for years and make a giant step forward on their first try.
After seeing my GME calls this morning. $20.5 C 1/15.

Out of SPX puts bigly. Waiting to see if /ES can close above 3690 to open some SPX call debit spreads expecting a reflex back to \~3725. Below that eek, 3670 would be a make or break point and I sit cash. Sub 3670 and the market pulled a fast one. Lots of people calling for a drop later in the month not fully hedged get burned. Likely today bull case stands and this is a shake out part 1, people add hedges an get get burned all the way up to 3800+, capitulate, and we go full send off the cliff for earnings, again

Yea like BNGO. It’s dipping now and went up by $2 in an hour at opening...good time to buy.

Apparently, China has started the misinformation campaign on quite a number of forums. Mind you, I have no idea if the following is true. 

It's a bit long, but the summary is that Jack Ma is a supposed traitor to China and its people. This was forwarded by a colleague from a Chinese friend of hers, read it at your own risk.

‐--------------

"Recently, many people seemed  confused with Beijing's decision to nab Jack Ma . Jack Ma was credited as father of modernizing China from a fragmented world to a fully connected digitalized world via internet and transforming china into a cashless society, surely he cannot be the bad guy. 

But what many people didnt know was Jack Ma Alibaba was actually 33% controlled by Softbank Japan and 22% by Wall street USA YAHOO finance, Jack Ma only has a meager 5.67% stake in Alibaba. This China success story is actually a story repeat of proliferation of opium in 1840, but instead of opium, they were offering the poorest Chinese farmers, hard labor workers with easy financing to purchase luxury goods that they do not need such as iphones (not huawei), jeans, branded bags,shoes etc and also offering cheap loans to university students, bypassing banks . 

Jack Ma was actually a front man, helping the Americans and Japanese to skin the naive 1.4bil normal citizens with tons of luxury goods that they cannot afford, by offering them financing at 17.7% interest per annum. Many chinese young people were conned to sign up for the latest iphones with 12 months easy instalment but not 0% interest, instead they were getting slapped with 18% interest per annum. All the young chinese hard earned money and the stupid farmers, were sending boatloads of money to USA tech companies, wall street banks and japanese softbank. Japan softbank was famous for making lots of wrong investment moves but still able to report record profit year after year, thanks to the traitor Jack Ma and his team, conned the public wealth and transferred it to the Japanese. 

Jack Ma's hatred of the CCP is so deep he even orchestrated the short selling of China A-shares with George Soros + wall st bankers in 2015, that almost caused a China financial crisis. Jiang Zemin and Bo Xilai were part of the team too, that wanted to destroy Xi Jinping's reign. That explains why the CCP after successfully defended the market in 2015, launched a series of high profile probes into the highest ranking china CCP officers and thrown them to jail, and Xi Jinping consolidated his power by naming himself unchallengable emperor. It was needed to destroy the traitors within the party. But amazingly Xi didnt punish Jack Ma in 2015. Many think the reasons were because Jack Ma was still needed to reform China digitally. 

Fast forwarded to today, China govt already owns now the best digital payment platform in the world, with help of wall street and softbank, 2 largest financiers in the world . Jack Ma was so arrogant that before Ant IPO that may attract up to $30 trillion at opening lambasted China govt as backward and claiming Alibaba is ready to replace them. But he didnt know that was the excuse Xijinping needed to foil his IPO party. 48 hours before IPO and on the day Trump was busy with USA ELECTION, CHINA GOVT announced suspending the Ant service IPO catching everyone by surprise, and JacK Ma was detained ever since without any mean of communication, until today. 

Jack Ma was a traitor all along. 
His success is not attributed to his hardwork, but his willingness to sell the country and use his network to connect external threat with internal opportunists that hated the CCP. 

His fate remained unknown but usually what happened to traitors, either they ended up in mysterious death or thrown in jail for 20 - 100 years. We dont know Jack Ma will end up in which, but certainly 1 of the 2."
Shuda wuda cuda
IM NOT FUKEN GUY SELLING OR BUYING.

Mainly because TD is down for me.
I love how every S&P stock is tanking and Tesla is just acting like a penny stock because it wants to.
SPY and NASDAQ are down 1 fuckin point, and y'all are panicking? Maybe it's because I don't have any options open, but a small 1 day dip is barely a speed bump. TF happened to diamond hands.

TSM finally starting to take off after a couple weeks locked at $105, at $112 now.
How would you rate the idea of start buying TSLA now? Pretty consistent with wsb guidelines I'd say..
Also holding PLTR, XPEV, NIO, TDOC calls for 1/08-1/15-1/29. Trimmed positions 85% on the EV. Holding this LIT until close to exp.

Picked up QS and AI calls for 1/15.

> Growth concerns are not at the root of selling since Treasuries are trading little changed and growth stocks are down alongside value stocks. In addition, global stocks traded higher following expansionary manufacturing PMIs for December out of the eurozone and Asia. 

> Instead, investors appear to be taking profits to begin the year, having avoided any taxes they would have had to pay this year if they sold last Thursday. Now they can wait a whole year to pay taxes on today's profits. - Briefing.com

“Long run”

“3-4 months”

Huh
If you think we know what an exit strategy is...
My fellow bagholder
Because... in the premarket because there’s low liquidity (lower number of shares available) the spread between bid and ask is wide... so most likely you bought them at the ask price (which is usually much higher than current stock price)
Exactly. There are people who did that. Very bullish IMO

Apparently my afternoon is gonna be made up of staring at NEE waiting for the right time to buy my January 2023 calls. It's down 2% I can buy one strike price lower for about the same price of the higher one was yesterday.

After buying it, I'm uninstalling Robinhood because there's no way I could feel confident seeing my position go down 10% if I looked at it every day.
Sell or hold MU calls ?

No we simply fell off the top cliff and fell onto the 2nd cliff
Oof. Yeah I just sold a bunch of stuff. It gave me the fear.

Haha it was the only year out leap I could afford like a month ago. 💎 hand time.
But why did you comment it twice.. lol
Dip-buying GME was a money printer all last year?
I pussied out and only bought 500 at pltr dip. 

Now average to 200 shares @26 😬
Bought a couple hundred shares today with the proceeds of earlier cash secured puts.

PLTR seems like a no brainer long term investment to me.
lol thank me later fml
I'm almost solo $AMD, so I have a cheap $TSLA leap put in case it dies. Cause if it does then it will be a slaughter across the board.
Sure buddy. You’ve been saying that for... let’s see... 5 weeks now?
[removed]
Second one
Both?
yikes
fubo swings lookin nice
Ive been telling you to go to cash for a month. The market doesnt even know my DD yet. I know how long the vaccines last for. This sell off is just the tip of what is about to happen.
Long run? Is this the new term for bagholding?  

Go back to r/investing and come back when your balls drop. See ya pal.
of THIS strain, and it's not done peaking because americans wanted to enjoy the holidays like nothing had changed
That retard made Alibaba to what it is, not every decision he made was perfect but if it wouldnt be for the CCP he would still be flexing money.
Reading some of these posts and feeling glad that I took profit on many of the stocks mentioned, then remembering my own sea of red on all the other stocks I kept.

Usually end of year to show “profits” to their customers.
Guys, I'm straight up not having a great time.
Sorry I’m EU autist gang so my “calls” don’t expire, 100% loss at $113 tho. Call warrants
March crash almost certainly caused a net increase of WSBers, and led to major gains throughout the year.
I fucking knew the pltr bears would be eating shit today
Told ya. Look for a retest of the last bull leg aka double bottom, then buy at a good bull signal bar betting on the double bottom.

If it breaks the double bottom with good follow through look for a measured move down.

ETA: 4hr TF

How did you find this stock? You saw it at the exact right moment. And I’d love to find the next one. Thank you for the thousands you made me in my ira!
Jack ma is in the gulag waiting for re-deployment.
Every semiconductor went down and tech too , it's not because it's AMD. If it wasn't a red day , AMD would have kept mooning , I took this opportunity to buy calls.
Everyone thought TSLA crashing would carry down the S&P, obviously the inverse, and TSLA is carrying it on it's back.
Didn’t buy the dip, but didn’t panic sell either.. Just numb to it I guess.. Saw the volumes on the 1hr candles from 12/31 and they’re muuuch higher than the current dump volume.
Nobody tell him.
WMT is up a little bit.
XL is such a move rn too bad im -$500 on it ;/ someone buy and hold for ez long term tendies
So its it one big cum or just lots of little cums until close
What positions? And you didn’t lose it if you didn’t sell🤔
I couldn't "load" up since I was already completely in, but collected enough premium to scrap another call diagonal spread. Got in near the bottom, I'm pleased I took them from peanut paper handers
Oh I agree completely. I’ve been watching it since last week and got in then. Today has been massive. I’m sure a small correction is due but the ARK interest and the sector they are in — I think it’s a safe long bet. Congrats on your earnings and happy new year!
2 TSLA shares, rest NIO
Y’all I really sold my BkNG puts for a 20% and the stock drops $100 after that. Bruhhh imagine missing out on 10K. 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Thats half this sub

How are those bags you're holding working out? Keep coming here for reaffirmation of your retarded plays.
stay away.
Selling after such a rally is probably for tax reasons. They can sell at the top and don't have to pay taxes for a 1 year+ period.
Not a good entry for aapl

How low will BABA Booey go
I knew that's what would happen the moment I got calls, sorry
Nice I just finished mine, decided to go with four slices of toast instead of my usual two.
If it’s at the strike your loss is the premium you paid for the call. 

Whatever you do, don’t start trading yet you need to do some reading. Otherwise you are going to be losing money
Yes, Also, play MRVL, SLV, and GDX. The markets are predicting a Democratic victory in Georgia. That is why most stocks are down while the precious metals and pot stocks are up.

I've been saying this about the UK for months, thinking we were coming to an end of this shit - but this new variant is 70% more transmissible and is no joke.  Something like 80% of new cases we're seeing here are of the new variant.
Looks like Abcellera found a bottom?
Sell? You buy the dip. There is no “sell”
Idgaf. I don’t want to beg my parents rent money
You don't sound like an actual GME gang. Positions or ban.

not til we retest
Other than weed stocks, this may be spot on.
I dunno.  Some retard bought my sold puts at 1.50 at a 21 strike.  I got like 20 of them.  That had to be the easiest 3k I made last week.  Also sold expired a put spread which made me another 3k last week.

You guys have effectively given me about 275 free stocks on this panicky retard bear shit.  ...and it wasn't even hard.  So thank you.

Nah that’s my finger up Melvins asshole
Just don’t play today boys looool
How is PLTR the only thing that is green in my portfolio? Lmao
Bull is back 🐂
Market is down? PLTR says: “I don’t give a nut”
There’s undoubtedly someone here who is wondering why CCL is down. It’s down because it’s now 2021 and bookings have not magically started back and they are still on the brink of bankruptcy.
December end was rough today’s rough it’s hard rn for anyone if your doing good your in the elite
Lets take a little nap and see if it turns green!
I love PCGs history of bankruptcies leaving stock holder's bag holders.
Gap my fucking asshole all the way to Gapplebee’s. AW FUCK
BTWN seems to be dropping more
PLEAS!!!!!
Ya not seeing a lot celebrating going on, just complainers about GME
Stop being an idiot
lol no just joking

Election uncertainty from runoff 

Maybe bubble bursting but who knows
Just sold my puts for a ~40% gain. Only had 5 contracts though so about 500 up.

It ain't much, but it's honest work for retards. Good luck!

Up 4% while the rest are getting slapped around.

That was the dip of the day. Weak hands wrekt
same, this and magni
Jack Ma is buying the dip from a chinese gulag, what’s your excuse?
NOT THEIR CEO YOU MORON
I'll agree to that.  Once you realize Walter is the bad guy it's _very_ hard to rewatch. I think the fact you don't really realize that until well past it's obvious on a rewatch is why it's in the same class as a drama.

The writing and series arc are phenomenal.

I include El Camino in the series as well.  That loose end being tied up makes the series much more palatable after the official series end point.
PLTR has gone parabolic.
The market hates EV stocks because the institutional douchebags are still upset about Tesla blowing up.
bottom is in boys  
buy the dip 🤑
Thank you. I feel welcomed.

100% profit better than an unknown. It could go to 200%, but also, it could go to 0%. 🤡
We're going on up!

Edit: And we're going back down!
So when you gonna sell?
... you called it?
Sold EoW puts @ $15 to buy more shares, this dip is as retarded as this sub/r $23 per 100 @ $15 by EoW is gravy and I’ll see you fucks in Valhalla either way
Tortoise II, IPO E+F
Lmao Mondays....
This does look like a dip to buy
PLTR 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 fuck yea buying the dip friday is paying off!
He's your supplier foo. Which makes him your daddy. Hahaha

Completely agree with you that Tesla is nowhere near Level 5 - I never claimed in my comments that they were. However, they are the closest to Level 5 and the gap between them and second place (Waymo) is HUGE.

Was hoping for the first open market day of 2021 to be green. The market decided otherwise 🥴
Here we fucking go with the virus doomsayers again, is this Groundhog day or something?
Don't realize? People realize they just either don't give a shit or feel there is nothing they can do. They're literally murdering Muslims and putting them in camps and the world watches, no wonder the Holocaust happened. And people have the gall to look back and say "how could we let that happen?"

well thanks. it was a few years ago and things patched up fairly alright; turns out that life is usually a v-shaped recovery if you don't sell at the bottom.

How about this Palantir fact:  

Was $32, now $23  

Maybe if you inverse your life like in the movie Tenet, you will actually make a gain with this company.
The covid situation with the new strain is out of control in UK. If this hits USA as bad as it has hit us expect it to be worse than it has been at its peak. Our NHS is genuinely crumbling. Boris expected to announce full national lockdown with stay at home order later tonight.
It was the same after ER for me. I'm still in green now, but boy I was 14% red back then. Even now when I see another red day I just look at the long term chart and it all fades away. If it will dip $0.5 below my any entry point I will sell some other positions and buy the dip.

And as much as I try to be polite to internet - for real -

Fuck those shorters. $1.5 down with 1M volume. That's just sick. It's beyond me how on earth can such obvious manipulation be allowed.

On the other hand congratulations to those who bought it.

💎👐 GME TO DA MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Could have had this money in Nio!
TSLA dip finally being bought, I hope...
Im also contemplating the same thing, on a much smaller scale.
IDK shall we?
BABA is going to outperform AAPL even after their CEO got sent to the Gulag

Yes, this dip peak is a perfect entry point for degenerates. Please help yourselves
Good luck, don't be afraid to take profit!
Only if you like tendies
When to sell Nio hmmm
Actually it’s because the GA senate race is becoming more likely Dems control both seats, thus the senate.  Cramer said the stock market wants pubs to win for grid lock and no new taxes.  He said it would be stock market nirvana if pubs hold.
Lol so sad I only bought 4 shares
I am red
Lol 7 - 3 is a little do able
Keep buying then

LOL. That fucking shape on GME is Melvin flipping everyone off. Literally murdering all of the dip buyers.
STONK OF THE DAY
Right I understand that part. 
So if it is at the strike on the close date, I get 100 shares, correct?
Sure happy I bought some VXX last week to hedge the rest of my portfolio. What are you guys buying on the discount?

Hold the line retards 🚀🚀🚀
You get them at the strike price, but you are out whatever you paid for the option.  So you come out ahead if the share price is more than the strike price + premium.

Are we buying the 🍏  dip?
Woke up to see down 4% gotta love it
You tell him, Frenchie.
Wtf. I thought about buying last week but then I saw it going up 100% and I said, nah, it’s not going to go further
Same but i’m 21
I sold some of my calls expiring soon and Re purchased calls for 2 buys 1/15 15c and 6 buys 2/19 15c
Nah, that’s been priced in for a while. The market didn’t really care and still doesn’t. There’s probably some concern about the tinfoil hats that are going to try to invalidate millions of votes tomorrow

Don’t regret: sell everything now ! (Unless you speak about call options the you are just fucked for 2021)
So what’s the play with the runoff and these calls, I feel like its kind of bullish either way, no? Much more so if democrats sweep though I guess?

Holding 2/19/21 ICLN $29C

Some get the ghost of Paul Volcker out here to address this crisis immediately.
No you get them at the strike of the call, that’s the point of options. 

It gives the holder the right to buy or sell at the strike price.
ICLN OTM April calls are printing
[deleted]
Looks like spy calls are free money today
You can sell the call option to someone or you can exercise your option to buy 100 shares at the strike price. You need to act on the contract. Sometimes the broker will do it for you but they have no obligation.
ive been holding calls since june, I assumed people knew about NIO day coming up

That's not so bad, people bought in at $24 when it peaked
Already got burned on GME not going there ever again
Ya I grabbed a couple 1/8 230$ calls when it went down to 225$. If we do see jack ma before end of week it will skyrocket out of nowhere
I think i heard about those in this george orwell book, they sounded really quite nice!

That's great, you should absolutely continue to exercise your right to protest in a free country.

I bet some Belorusian Yanukovich supporter is also telling someone else that they should be happy because they things aren't as bad as in China. There's always something worse, it's not an excuse.

I regret the day I came across this subreddit

Where is that retard that put 1 mil in CRSR lmao
I think you really underestimate the challenge in creating this kind of technology in a streamlined and effective manner. Companies theoretically could create their own technology for much, much cheaper, but they won't.

It's like saying that hospitals that make billions of dollars a year can easily afford to produce their own electronic medical records in house and avoid the huge markups by companies like EPIC. Well, no, they don't and they won't. 

Intelligence agencies are good for intelligence. They have tech people supporting their enterprise, but creating an entire system that works competitively is not their expertise and they don't have the institutional knowledge or experience to make it happen. At best, you get antiquated and weak systems like the one that this commenter is mentioning. 

Also, as Palantir grows in utilization, it provides linkage opportunities for the intelligence community, which is a game changer. EPIC in healthcare is extremely expensive with lots of much more better priced competition - but almost all hospital systems are adopting it because 1) it's better than its competition and 2) every hospital that uses it can share information which makes taking care of patients much easier. That's the same scenario I can see with Palantir.

Yea you can get a margin on Degiro and has, as far as I know, more products than trading 212. I really think you should stick to regular securities if you're brand new to trading. You know when you see adverts for CFD trading and it says 75% of retail investors lose money... yeah, don't be part of that statistic.

Degiro hasn't gone down once for me in 5 years

For the year*
I think it will most likely be February, not March. As an example, Palantir released Q3 2020 earnings (i.e. ending September 2020) on November 12, 2020. So figure a delay of a month and a bit to release quarterly earnings.
We can stop talking about GME now, yes?
this arcade is rigged and i demand a refund
Well, those MSFT and SPY puts are working out. May go get a new tutu.

Exactly right.  I'm getting better at the timing but there is always this last little pump before the dump and it fucks me a bit.

Still though.. did well on my VXX calls today.
Was looking for the first post on “the reason”. Always retroactive, always random and fake lol.

These meme stocks are either up 10% or down 10% but don't follow each other.  No news.  Just random 10% movesl

I have a SPY put expiring today that is ITM. If I don't sell it before close when does it get priced?
So if you are ITM on a call do you literally get the 100 shares at the share price... I am so fucking confused after watching videos.

Perfect time to BUY MORE GME
The market is down like 1% you fucking noob.  "Plunge", lol
My $MT Journey:

Bought at 2/19 $30 strike for .64 cents on 12/15. It rose to .90 on 12/16 then gradually went down to .22 right before New Year's. And while watching MT stagnate at $23 for two fucking weeks and watching the option price go down, I kept buying back in to bring the average cost down. I felt like shit the entire time, checking my account 100 times a day, even during Christmas. 

The option price peaked at .47 this morning and I sold right at that very tip. Broke even. 

MT ain't going to 30 by 2/19. Maybe 25, but I'm done with MT. Good luck to those still holding on.
Actually never mind I’m a retard too
So is this the upgraded Drill Team 7 that’s come in today?

Still got GA senate/Trumps Reichstag takeover to drop this shit more
New strains that spread way quicker. U.K. will probably lockdown tonight, much of Europe may follow. Everything should bounce back by February and should be surging in March, so you might as well buy the dip.
I missed out a serious ammoubt of money in profit because of this. I had about 125 call options on Tesla I got before the New Years. And because of the systems going down when the price shot up by $30 my contracts value went down or stayed  the same
sir jack a lot is dead
“Need some money? Will you be dead soon? Call us!”

Yes. It’s holding up my account.
I found watching it with someone else so you could keep all the characters straight was a huge help. 

I liked it because unlike so many shows it's a 3 season series that wraps up neatly and satisfyingly. Definitely one of the better shows I've watched during COVID. Don't give up on it, I know the voiceovers are pretty rough.

My god they actually waited for the first day of the year to rank the market. Guess no one wanted to pay taxes and realize gains for 2020. Now they can wait till 2022 to pay up.

Think this is all political uncertainty.  That Trump call put GA - and thus the senate in dire jeopardy for Republicans.  I'd say "what a moron", but I don't think he gives a single shit about the Republican party or the country for that matter.

No. The purpose is to maximize gains and eliminate risk with aggressive outlook. Stability would be a mutual fund.
Market decided to go sky diving as a New Years resolution.
FUCK 2021

SPAC’s are the market’s canary
spy put expiring today down 60% Friday and up 35% now.. This is too damn stressful, but yet I keep buying retarded short term puts
So if we get another Guh in March and Fed have already cut interest rates and pumped money until the printer is out of ink.  What is left another stimulus? Dollar falling to 60?
My portfolio says otherwise 🚀🚀🚀🚀

If you do then you can apply it to the fact that Jack Ma has distanced himself from Alibaba for more than a year and has switched his focus to various other things. Literally giving up power.

500 shares at 24.25, just going to sit and wait. If it crosses $24 today ill probably sell a few weeklies.
Like I said, with the right FA, you can guess some entry points.  But if you're wrong, and you will be, you're gonna need to be relying on that FA to get your ass out of it while you're bag holding.  Otherwise, you're gonna sell and lose.

Lol I know TA lololol.  You didn't read what I wrote.  I know it so well that I had software doing it, and I personally know how successful algorithms work too, since I work for a firm doing it.

lol is this Dan Bilzerian XD
If I had to guess, the current president is trying to subvert American democracy with his left hand and trying to start a conflict with Iran with his right hand.  Meanwhile he’s pissing  and shitting on everything else.
And this is why hedging is important if you bagholding
Scooping AMZN and CRM

Your argument is strawman when you think American prisons are remotely comparable to re-education camps for Uyghurs
Is this a bear market now
Thanks for helping me find my missing chromosome sweetie
How can someone this stupid have 40k of cash to trade with lol
P.S. days like this reinforce to me that we are not in a bubble. 

Stonks will continue to go up soon
Been looking to get off of it - was going to scoot to plus500, does degiro have the same leveraged stock portfolio that say 212 would have? Happy to take suggestions. Sick of outages mainly

God I hate TSLA
i have spy $373 puts, is that good?
Stonk market is forward looking!
Damn just realized spy is down 1.3%. I was just looking at my pltr🚀 calls!! HA!!
I'm only able to get on WSB for a moment due to meetings, but wanted to stop by and say fuck Tim Apple.
Good god, you dumbasses gambling on weeklies 😖
May not be the exact bottom but it is certainly oversold imo. I think it would be a good time to get leaps. Just prepare to stay strong and think long term lol
I want circuit breakers
16k but today makes ya feel good.
Not even the right words to the song... lifetime ban
Just imagine, at least one person went all in on SPY calls dated for today thinking “No way the year starts red”
Why's the market on fire? Do I buy the dip?
Difference is China is looked up to and enabled by the West.
Thank you so much. My paper hands were thinking about letting go.

How long for a short squeeze?
You were very correct!! 💯🚀🚀🚀

Premarket is like precum, it feels good but can completely fuck you up later
worst case scenario for people who made massive gains in 2020, the market crashes early 2021 and sell at a loss

irs sees 2020 gains and wants their cut, but you lose all those gains beginning 2021.

wow QQQ dumped HARD
Dont be a retard and paper hand, we got this, wait for end of week, 💎 hands

Please just be a bear trap, my portfolio can’t take this anymore lmfao

Why are we dropping
Holy fuk . Deadre Bose looking like a snack on Cnbc.
If this continues... stock market will be at zero before the end of the year.
NOW IS A GREAT TIME TO BUY XL. imo
What's gonna stop SPY? Are we heading for 355?
what do we buy in the firesale?
Such a painful day.... HODLLLLLL AND BUY LETS GO!
This is literally a drop in the bucket given that pltr market cap at 50b. I hope it's a bullish sign of things to come though
thanks for making me feel better

I think you can have up to 3 in a year before anything happens.
Literally anything: Books, hitmen, drugs, seeds, insanely good coupons, passports/SS, hackers for hire, plus many forums that advocate for a positive change that no government wants to exist - conversely, forums that are depraved and whose users deserve worse fates than death, etc.
For sure
Ment week*
I don't know what difference It makes but holding my 21 shares like there's no tomorrow
On what plays ?
MP materials 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I got one in 2012. Then last year they said it was obsolete, so they offered me a new one for like $15. Similar to a Kindle Fire. They just wanna make sure u have it at any cost so that ad $ keeps rolling in. ROKU is a great aggregator for all streaming services.
Nice
SPACs getting SMACKED
100%
If QQQ can go <310 thatd be great
And back down Apple goes. Rip
Ah okay
Be cool if it moved before the 15th lol
Up 9.5k to 5k in 20 mins hahaha fuck
I for one think your a god, sir.
*OMG, 2021 literally is the worst year everrrrr*
Sold off the rest of the ETFS in my IRA, bought the PLTR dip like a fool, bought more WCLD, QQQJ, HAIL, and snagged a few leaps/calls (BETZ 32c Jul 16, QQQJ 35c Jun)

I'm never trusting premarket again

You didn't lose it, you spent it on AMD stock
So we can make Cyberbunk 2077??? Thats so epic
Damn. Might as well just deposit the rest in because if you try to do the two deposits daily it'll take longer. also you can buy shares on provisional buying power. I usually do this while my money settles from the bank and then sell shares so at least I'm making money in the meantime
Fucking BFT
BABA back to 211...

For all the haters of the UVXY suck it... Just today up over 10% IV went from 85% to 155%.  But you guys keep on buying your QS, GME, CRSR...

ATTENTION ALL RETARDS! CHINA EV IS DIPPING, THIS IS YOUR LAST CHANCE TO GET OUT OF BOTTOMLESS PITS GME AND PLTR AND SIDE WITH THE CCP

I mean you won't lose money if you're patient

Wtf just happened to ARKK..
I think aapl 100% is. I specifically held my 125c 1/15 thru last week because of that. Was planning on selling today, not so much now......
TSLA and NVDA the only thing keeping SPY from drilling to chyna.

that's how i felt when my wife died, but on the plus side she can't see my portfolio.

just don't forget to groom and keep your place clean every day--especially when you don't want to and have no reason to.  the rest handles itself.
hmm


spy to zero EOD?
Using it for prediction seems difficult, however. I suppose that's also why the academics don't take it seriously. 

There is a fine line between reflexivity and insanity.
LOL. A few stop loss raids. I am definitely buying this dip. Numbers coming up Jan 14, revisit this thread on the 18th.

Stonks never go up
Big taxes on it
I never invest in Chinese companies. I lived there for 3 years and have a Chinese commercial law degree, it's all smoke and mirrors and mirages. You can't trust shit, CCP has their hands in everything and they do what they want, best not to play that game.
Daily charts all over the place looking fucking terrible.
Enjoy dude, my jobs been remote since March and my workload has increased lol, hoping one of these days is a slow day

Why is Apple dumping? Been like a week straight
a little upset i waited until 1030 to buy bearish positions on tech, but it was almost becoming 100% predictable with a dump for the first hour of the day into green. So many times of getting bearish positions shrekt. Maybe its different this time?

Thanks for helping my paper hands. Will try to 💎
I'm gonna wait until it hits the ATH, that way I know it will always go up.

It’s actually more effective than having a whole system ran with majority AI processing. The software is more malleable and sheds the unnecessary use of predictive computing in places where it doesn’t need to be applied.
More infections will inevitably mean more deadly, because the health care system will be further overwhelmed and patients that could have been saved will die instead

If you're looking for American rights abuses then start with police/prison. Civil asset forfeiture, mass incarceration, 94% conviction rates, prison labor, those dudes in California who fight fires for the $6/day only to not be allowed to join fire departments when they leave prison due to their criminal record, etc. Your comment represents a particular kind of strawman that is a misdirection away from material issues. Fuck your bad faith bullshit, only bulls allowed here think numbers go up.
Will NIO see $56 this week?
Oh nvm I still had it in my wallet. false alarm!

Unrelated, but I hate the trend of execs or other rich and powerful people wearing a dozen hemp bracelets or kabala strings or meditation beads or whatever on their wrist, often right behind the Patek.

It's like they are trying to say: 'Sure, this tailored Brioni suit and my vintage Swiss chronometer might cost more than a small condo, but I'm still just a dirty hippy at heart.'

No worries! Make sure you know PGP like the back of your hand. If you aren't doing anything shady - Test it out between two computers. Make sure it is done 100% correctly and up to today's protocols.



It is a wild and fun place to explore. That said, please be very careful!

IN FUCKING DOWN 3K MANNNNN
Bid-ask spread. You are showing the market price, but it will cost more to close your short. There is a reason why there is no commission in 212. The spread is larger than it actually should be, because those chads are fucking you when you enter and exit the trades.
This is also why the vast majority of shmucks lose money, odds are stacked against your from the start.

Read the shit up and then do your YOLOs and don't forget to lever up to your personal risk tolerance.
Hey they had rockets in the tldr and comments too.

The novelty of my new job wore off really quickly since I’m WFH. Money is just a number when you don’t have anything or anyone to spend it on/with.

I know man. I picked up more today wtf still down big time
In short?

It concerns me, but in a way it reminds me of 2019 when Trump was starting a trade war every other month. Yep, it made the markets as chaotic as fuck. Yep, I'd like him to get off fucking Twitter. BUT it didn't change the fact the US market was where all the juicy tendies were at.

I'd love it if the CCP weren't a bunch of fucking arseholes however its hard to find a better game in town at the moment.
Trump leaving office is why this is happening
Yeah, as soon as it approached $17, it slowed down a lot. I assume it's just short-term profit taking.

My app glitched and I couldn't cancel the $18.6 limit buy, it went through despite me banging on the touchscreen. I would've been so happy to grab the $17.2 though, but oh well...
Fucking crm man

First, you're already on the right track.  That's not positive-thinking B.S., the fact that you see/admit it's making you unproductive is an essenetial start that many folks don't want to admit, so cheers for that.

The thing that gets anyone to stop habits for good is that they focus on the thing they GAIN rather than the experience (in your case getting high) that they're losing.  Sure you're giving up getting high, but there's something bigger that you're gaining (your productivity.  Perhaps elucidate further what it is you're gaining so it's more vivid to you.  Don't just think about it, genuinely write it/type it down.  What does your productivity mean to you?  What else are you getting beyond productivity?  No wrong answers here.).

At the same time, think about the fact that by smoking weed you are LOSING all of that good stuff.  What you're doing here is getting very clear & straightforward about just how much you DON'T like what you're getting when you smoke, and how much you LOVE what you're getting when you don't.

As soon as your mind genuinely understands that what you're getting is w/o question worth more than what you're losing, the choice of not smoking will feel as obvious and automatic as the choice to drive in the right side of the street.
What a braindead reason to short a stock. No wonder you're down £700 in a week
Puts here! Get your puts!

I have actual shares and then also a “doomsday” position, 20c for July
vale and zm saving my crm calls rn
It was down for half an hour. At least in Germany
The merger usually happens the day after man.

Hence why Jan 20th is the VOTING date. Merger follows...
You know  it's bad when your ToS chart is dumping so hard the scale readjusts because otherwise the red bar would be out of sight...
This will probably be 1/2 this subs first >1% red day, and the last day they come to this sub.

Its melvin and their manipulation. Dont give them shares to cover.
For anyone wondering about reasons behind ICR Tech change.

I posted [this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ko2i9h/juicy_gme_dd_reason_behind_icr_change/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) few days ago. 

It highlights the direction and some of the news they will be releasing.
CRSR goin the wrong way
I have some techs (MDB, UPWK, NET)that have been losing 2% a day for like the last 10 trading days. When does the blood shed stop

STOP ✋

I literally bought 9 shares about 30 min ago
Always wire. Pay the $15 fee
AMZN you bitch!
I got spy and apple
The dilution they’ve done for cash raise is going to come back around at some point, oh ya and we have a president that is trying to kill democracy, whatever pops the Tesla bubble prolly won’t pop on its own, it’ll need some broader market help

Also their current valuation allocated 1.25 million per car sold in 2020, even if they increase their sales forty percent they’re still looking at a million dollars of their valuation per car sold, which... just doesn’t make sense
K like what
100% you gotta beat the spread that trading 212 has on it first before you're in the money that's all it is!
Markets pricing in Mitch the Bitch losing

damn this market been weak but now it’s just looking sad
Who keeps giving auto mod platty lol
Despite my PF being complete and utter trash otherwise, I am bigly green today bc of BINGO
SPY -1% for now, I appreciate it's early doors still (I'm UK so it feels like more EOD right now).

But yeah I think reduced cases, vaccine, all got the market too excited and a reality check is coming in HARD.

I'm freeing up capital to buy the dip, if we get one.
Close the markets please
Lol Thursday up 50% for the day so got some cushion for the fall might buy more
I messaged them yesterday telling them the manager still hasn’t reached out, only HR. They just told me he will contact me today. Only thing I have scheduled for my day is a call with HR at 5pm  lmao

Clang gang and 0DTE spy puts were a good combo
Holy hell someone call an ambulance for SPY, should have just bought puts at open and been rich today.
Never trust a fundamental analysis

Small 500ish share position and I ain't fucking selling
Who recommended BiNGO ?  Bless you bro
It’s dumping now. I have no idea why
There’s dozens of posts on DD for GMEs bull thesis
I have never been more bullish in my life
sad
> To manage volatility, the Tokyo Stock Exchange and the Osaka Securities Exchange set “daily price limits” for all securities. These limits create a price range outside of which a security may not trade on any given day. Limit prices must also fall within this range. 

No wonder Japanese stocks have been dead for decades. Literally outlawing volatility.
You guys are paying taxes?
up or down?
Where do you guys think TSLA will be eom after earnings?
It goes down .5% after being up 5% intra day and it’s “getting DRAGGED”?
Who’s flexing. Go earn money. If losing 3k is a lot you don’t have enough. Go be an orthodontist. You’re not gonna win the lottery
Which of you retards bought the Jan 08 QS 52p that’s up 51,000% today?

Here is here amongst us, masturbating to these comments.

Would BA be a good pickup? Slowing getting closer to $200 than $210
Shout out to the guy who called for gap up and bleed into close .
I just sold my bleeding shares for May $15c
maybe this week, getting priced in now? I haven't been following the runoffs too closely but seems close.

Do yall think BABA would be a good long term buy? LIke either Jack Ma comes back praising xi, or they put in a new guy but would he have same vision? or would it not even matter at this point .. too big to fail type stuff
Good advice thank you fellow retard 🙏

NIO goes up when US market goes up. NIO still goes up when US market goes down. Big D energy.
that's a bubble for ya

Everyone thinks they can get out before it pops. Most of them are wrong
Gonna buy more at close.
I didn’t say anything about Powell, did I? The president is a huge proponent of Israel and has advanced Israeli and Jewish interest throughout his administration. AIPAC is the most powerful lobby in Washington and many members of the House and Senate serve Israeli/Jewish interests.
Are you not aware of that?
MAKE VOLATILITY GREAT AGAIN
there are so many 10 bagger options at the beginning of the year, good luck retards
True
oh god
Nah market should be plummeting - but people should be buying the dip.

Weird flex but ok
Looks like drilling all day??? Have calls in STX WISH SQ which are holding up pretty well...
The elites will let us in when it’s time to dump...
I believe it's 3 days after Q4 2020 earnings, but no date has been announced so it can be anytime in Feb/early March depending on when they report earnings.
Fuck you NVDA holders!! I sold shares in PM I’ve been holding for months waiting on a day like this. Fuckkkkkk!
Yeah I guess, I just bought contracts that were one week out because I was playing on my small account. Definitely didn’t expect it to moon this early but oh well 🤷‍♂️ made good money on VALE

Jesus man I'm really sorry to hear that, people should really just appreciate that people are giving out advice. Nothing is certain, and this market is fucked anyways so solid DD can go tits up.

&#x200B;

I really appreciate you, and the 3k I've made since your post. So thanks.
I'm still gonna try to buy those NEE LEAPs
Since you are down 30% you most likely bought a weekly lol , that is so retarded
JP who?   The only possible reason for stupid fucking recommendations like this to be some kind of profitable scam to one their big customers

The original Morgan would have fired every one of these idiots
Nobody KNOWS where any stock is going in short term trading or even long term for that matter...TA just helps gauge probabilities and we trade based on those probabilities and we can be wrong which is why stop losses are a thing. If you don't believe then you don't believe. Not gonna argue with you when you clearly have no intentions of seeing the benefits of TA lol
Can someone let me know the current value of SPY 371p 1/4's please? Robinhood won't let me see them


I sold out early and it's still free falling so I'd like to know how much I should be chastising myself here
and when you selling?
They’re buying the dip?
dw my friend its a long play
Guys I am a large sized palantir bull. So much so that I even behave like a boomer and buy filthy dirty shares of it. I do this regularly.

I must have missed a lot with GME but why does everyone expect it to moon? Even the Chewy CEO invested a big chunk.
Nah bro it's solid
They don't call it BULLion for nothin
just did. Down a few percent on calls already but that’s aaaaaalright
Any reason cruises and airlines are falling off the face of the earth rn?
Can't read, can you autist?
Good thing my AAPL and PLTR Calls are for Feb 5th... Shit

CRSR, you have 11 days. Pleas hit 40
Goddamn knew I should have sold AAPL when it reached Softbank highs but greed definitely got the better of me.
Holy fuck! My Bear Call spread may actually print
I believe it is the beginning of a new tax year and people are selling to lock in gains  for the new year.

Can't wait for PLTR to show up in animes.
We figure out why metals up today? Risk off due to election?
first u have to make money
The markets are predicting a Democratic win in Georgia. Pot stocks and precious metals are up while the market is down because of potential tax implications. If Democrats win, gold and silver will skyrocket.
Well this is terrifying
Bringing back unwanted college memories 😢😢
Good price.  I kept adding to it.  Now I'm sitting at $12.  There's speculation about earnings this week.  If it pops over 15 I would be VERY surprised.

What is a “portfolio”?

Sir this is a casino
What you want?? It takes days too long to see if Ryan Cohen is accumulating GME or not. It is a waiting game
No matter how much you’re down you can turn this shit around just buy the dip on shit that you can hold long term
Bears 🐻 rise up
CYA email them asking for guidance. If no response go enjoy.
Can fcel stop drilling 5rh day in a row or w.e.
This is the kind of DD that only comes around once in a lifetime.

Like planets aligning fifth element shit.
Agreed completely with you, I just think it’s hilarious. Somebody has gotta be buying in right now and thinking it’s a good price. I’m good.

I think boomers are taking profits before the senate shit this week. Plus mango man praised the market last week which always causes a crash. 
If there’s a blue chip crashing right now I’d buy the dip this week.

Congrats to everyone who had a position in NIO today.
Position?
Not sure it will lead to growth that’s being priced in, but I also bought shortly after the IPO. I can afford to wait

no. nobody's done any DD on that ticker that you could easily search for in this sub. none at all.
Not true.  You need to realign your ideas, because stocks are being inflated long-term right now while money is being printed.  Market cap still means a huge part of it.
Diamond hands. If u sell ur actually a vagina
Ah, the Japanese approach
Read the bit where it days 76% of cfd traders lose money. If you don't understand how it works then you're part of that 76%. Get out of cfds and don't go back... Seriously.

I need to yolo $10K into something today so I can make $4K by the EOD or RH will lock me out again. 

Any suggestions?
PLTR scores another deal, this time with the Japanese government. The country is conservative as hell but agrees to a brand new platform. Bullish af
If DASH holds 140 today through this sell off seems like a buy opportunity. I realize this place hates DASH but it has been a rock at that support

&#x200B;

edit: for a short-term swing by the way, not holding it long
reporting in
short term probably TSLA, but i think long term Nio is going to multiply more
Haha I saw that and thought "how stupid, no way"

If i cant remember or find any history as to why i bought QQQJ calls. I didn’t do my due diligence. This is on me 🤡
Watch tsla split to 300 so people can buy 2 shares with their simmi

Anyone buying the dip today or waiting for more clarity over the coming days?

I think you made a good play.  
I believe the new sedans and battery are already baked in for NIO day.

The 55 strike still has the highest volume for 1/8 expiry.  
I sold 82 call contracts this morning.

Midweek I wouldn't be surprised if NIO goes above ATH, but I'm wary that it will go back down to mid 50's after NIO day.

I’m sure one of the first things we’d do is cancel any debt that we owe them. Once you embargo a country, you aren’t going to continue sending them debt payments. They only own about $1.1 trillion anyway. We spent more than that on stimulus payments this year.

i'd hole till mid week and reevaluate. Then I'd maybe buy a ITM call a month or two out. NIO looks like it's going to be $60 very soon.

There’s going to be a day in the near future where you’re going to kick yourself for not buying GME at sub $18. It will reach $25 by end of month, possibly end of week.
You will be very lucky to see NIO below 50$ again
I foresee a lot of long term GME investors.
Cash gang till Feb. Lost enough money last year lol
Wish I had the balls to buy puts on qs and ai recently.
NIO ship hasn't sailed yet. It's gonna go parabolic until NIO day, which is end of this week. Then it will steadily climb for the rest of the year as the plans set forth on NIO day are gradually met. NIO is about to climb double digits like last year.
Please moon it like NIO

IV is insane, get shares
Guy who bought UXVY1000 shares of SHOW UR SELF
You don't want to be short anything, but when you are short vega, you essentially capture "realized" gains right away due to high IV, aka inflated premium prices. Volatility falls to zero (as does time), so you want to take advantage of that imo. 

Diagonals are typically long vega, and even though I got in on PLTR near the top and historical volatility and IV have fallen to the lowest it's seen since DPO, I am near breakeven on the position (even though I am also long delta) because the vega and theta exposure help offset losses.

You have to remember, if TSLA has one or two flat days, IV will take a huge hit. When you are short vega, you are basically only at risk of IV rising. If it falls or stays the same (which means falling), you have a better chance at success

Show your positions not your transaction
Ayyyy gabagool, Mets baybeee!!!
Yes exercising means you are buying 100 shares at the strike price. The problem is the value of your call is made up of both intrinsic and extrinsic value. Your call contract is worth more than 100 shares at the strike price if you are ITM. So it is preferable to just sell your call contract to someone else rather than exercise. Here’s another very good easy and funny video on the topic https://youtu.be/K78oaoq-wb0

Are you a fucking retard?

EV has been hot, they sure want to delist an EV COMPANY. 

ESP WHEN TRUMP HAS BEEN TALKING ABOUT GYNA SPIES ANS STEALING TECH. 

HELLO? CHINESE TELECOM COMPANY AT 6$?!

HELLO
NIO $60 eow
They played us with those futes 😔👌
What your position?
They really mean it when they say not to look at the market the first hour. Fuck it's only 10:45.
is this what they call retard strength tesla?
jan 29 $155c aapl
sold my calls to lock in profit
No position, but how the fuck is NKLA still a $15 stock?

Who the fooook is buying that crap?
lol i just sold $10 puts
[deleted]
People don't realize that PLTR is kind of like a hedge stock, but arguably better than regular hedges like gold. Any terrorist attack, natural disaster, pandemic, tensions with Iran/China, or all out war is bullish for PLTR. Don't you guys get it? It's inversely correlated to the market and black swans.
Sold out and put the money into growth generation
Its broke for me too
I'm thinking we'll see TSLA back to $735...then it's going to make a run up to $750.
122 and increasing 13.45 EUR/share
Time will tell who the real dummy are

Getting fucked by Apple
Hell yes!  🚀 vibes
Pltr green!!!  Well done 💎🙌
Just mentally tell yourself it's a $0 and don't look at it. In 3mo it's either going to actually be $0 or you'll be green.
100 percent knew NIO was going to crush here and I still blew it
NIO day
seems like if you have conviction this is the time ago go all in.... feeling so much pain today but fuckit buying more shares cause I beliebe
📉yes.
Only holding NIO / XPEV / ICLN / TSLA

it’s a good day
Or release statements saying you bought on Thursday, that would be fine too
[removed]
Post was deleted.... interesting 🤔
In the year 2025 the stock market will be open 7 days a week and grow to a full blown casino where they report on stocks like they do sports 🎰🤑🤡
Etoro too
IV for NIO is so high that you're better off buying shares
You are the anagram of "trader".
Set a remind me. I promise you there’s a dip, idk when. But there will be at least 1 dip before NIO day
LI heading back to $48
As soon as you throw away all the red apples, no more red apples in the fridge
Of course NIO pops after my $54 call expired worthless on the 31st.
You are taking profits as soon as they start an uptrend lol , I'm chilling since I know AMD will continue going up.
Same
Oh LI just like that 😩😩😩
You can buy GHlV calls right now that are 2-4 months before exp for the price of basically just the intrinsic value alone
Holy sht lmao QS -35%? F to all the call holders
Damn NIO come back down so i can buy back in.
[removed]
Fuck no, holding firm but selling calls against them
Why who’s on
I am so upset at myself for not selling
Bro didn't they have a "prime day" that was free money? singles day or some shit?

Fuck.. its on its way to single digits...
WHY DID I SELL MY NIO CALLS LAST WEDNESDAY AHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Just move on to the next ticker my duder.
Cause why not
overvalued as fuck. if we get another lockdown itll spike back up though
Ded
For me the China thing was a big thing, especially now with Jack Ma. These people are fucking psychopaths, anyway company is bound to succeed. 

Civil war also bullish for PLTR, my cucked broker won't offer any other defense stocks.
Lol 🤡🤡🤡
Holy FUCK. NIO BIG HUGE COCK OMG.
#GOEV UR BREAKIN MY HEART BB 😔
What would happen to BABA stock if Jack Ma was confirmed dead?
I'm with you brother, 540 shares strong plus a few calls. Get rich or go broke trying.
Just DD Coinbase. Big player in cyptocurrency. They earn money from transaction fees.
Ren and Stimpy FTW
I lost so much money on ACB, I've decided only a retard is buying stock on what is essentially an overvalued crop farm.
Georgia runoffs dems up in the polls right now. Trump phone call probably not helping the case for GOP senators in Georgia. If Dems win, we can count on a huge spending bill, more inflation, more stimulus. Silver to the MOON!
william LI ❤
I am confused af with TSLA, I finally can't determine what it's gonna do. I have been buying calls and it's been profiting me nicely by paying my dumb college tuition but now I just don't know if I should buy call/put tbh.

Update: AAPL is riding me raw as if there's no tomorrow without any lube.   
I might buy PLTR put for this week 22.5
Do it with style, and you'll be a legend either way.
Does anyone else get the feeling that this whole sub is going to get wiped out due to complete over investment  in tech and memes and complete inability/ desire to assess or own boomer stocks?
I have no idea what the fuck the rest of the day will bring since we’re not even 2 hours in
how the hell is it up 11%
Highest call volumes are still on the 55 strike.
Hope you sold
Maybe take off in a week or so got calm down
Have you, or anyone you know, spent a notable sum at gamestop in the last decade?
What time? ;)
AI, bruh come on
10 of these new contracts a year would be an additional 20% yoy growth. It all will add up quickly
Su Bae.
I may or may not have just pooped my pants
If it’s any consolation, just being a part of the story is enough for me.
Any news on AMD why it's popping today?
[removed]
they are and that's exactly why I'm bearish in REITs - too much of a shopping mall allocation. Dying middle class alone could kill malls. With all the online retails I just don't see how they will survive. People I worked with on a few projects actually own a mall and the timeperiod of ROI on that sucker is enormous. Margins a razor thin, competition is fierce and every now and then something goes against them. I wouldn't touch such business with a stick.
Dump my MT shares for more GME?
Buy more. Momentum is real now
Happens all the time. Teaser to build hype going in. Presumably even better stuff is being saved for the actual presentation.
NIO 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
We really do live in a society
Lol @ people FOMOing into QQQJ based off of that guys post. Good job bag holders
Disney has support at 177.00, I thought. Surely it won't go too far under that, I thought. 

Whelp there go my tendies.
Not even sold outside of china. Trash.
Don’t forget ROKU!

Also wondering.  Airlines getting murdered too.  I’m just waiting for the “vaccine required flights”.  Will 🚀

Please don't. I sold a few weeks ago for a 15% gain and now it's up 1000% since.
GOEV is clapping my cheeks. It’s unpleasant because I’m bullish.

My buddy made steak for dinner last night. First time I've had it in a good while. I usually like medium well. Anyway, I added some extra seasoning to the meat and we had some potatoes too. Maybe what, 20min or so after the meat consumption my stomach was rumbling like crazy. Now being the good friend that I am, I held that bad boy in, couple rumbles here and there but no toxic release which felt like the right thing to do. After I went home later that night I had a little more to eat and home something to drink. Finally let everything release and felt amazing. Fast forward to trade time and I had to take a nice dump. Super smelly but again, felt good. Hopefully the meat decay isn't causing this foul odor that just seems to cut through the air. Should I detox or something? Or will this all pass?
[deleted]
ill sell you mine. I got one still in the box I have it . havent used it in atleast 4 years. message me .
GLD and VXX are better for this month
So nothing
GME dip it’s still a dip it’s down over 5% today get in here 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
You will only see it after AMD goes to $110. They like to buy high.
Uh oh VIX up 11%
Just pure consolidation leap over the last 3 weeeks. Bound to happen at some point. Mostly TSM.
BIDU ples fly again
The only fate worse than $rope is 🌈
PLTR
I sincerely hope you sold
Why is TTD down 3-4% every day for a month now LMFAO
Every day*
I’ll be back in soon. I think we dump, a few shorts start to cover and the cycle starts up again

Ok PLNTR enough is enough just fucking fly

Wow someone shot QS in the face.
what's the news on QS?
Wtf tsla
damn I still remember someone saying Baba call was free money a week ago bruh
+1 with this. How the tables have turned. Fuckin ameripoors
There’s no reason for Apple to be at the price it’s at right now. Should be max $100 even with all the growth
There is no more dip bro. To the moon it goes.
NIO $55 before Friday and $70 after the conference
you ever looked at a circuit board? they're green

Probably new Covid fears?
I can’t wait for the day CRSR gets treated like LOGI. And not just because I yeeted half my money into it
We'll be opening our circus on the moon next week 🤡🚀🚀🚀

Yeah. Big tech down = potentially higher corporate taxes.
So, what’s going on with PLUG?
Cohen give us another 500k buy right now I dare you fuck it buy another million shares
LI 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
They meant "no way TSLA hits a $1000 again, in 2020."
It’s just going to keep going up
Do you not know how to zoom out a chart.
Whats going on
Stop being 🌈🦄
And Portyboy.
The whale fucked me on these LYFT FD’s lol
For sure, Ryan Cohen dropping eight figures on shares everytime melvin drops it a few percent is "0 bull conviction" in the face of the $9 you made on puts at open.
Got a good feeling we’ll see a big run up this month
I feel like as soon as I sell a call on PLTR its gonna have one of those retarded days where it shots up and every mouth breather in this reddit wont stop talking about it
Same, I see it going sideways near term
I’d like to go in bigly but concerned about a “sell the news” situation.
Correct me if I’m wrong, but wasn’t there some talk about the deal being investigated, as the gvt was scared of something like monopol with the ARM deal? Haven’t seen it myself, but my uncle told me during Christmas
Getting the popcorn ready to see all the QS loss porn. Going to be sweet
lol
I wonder how much Ryan Cohen is buying today...
NIO has pulled the mask so many times that I have PTSD of losing tendies. Panic sell, paper hands, pussy etc.
My calls are bleeding
Cuz ur broke bro

Before we commence, a thousand thank yous for GameStop. I sold some of my Disney to buy it.

I exited all my meme stocks last week (including GME) for B/N/G/O. I can't say I'm upset.
SWBI, RGR, SPWH
Really? MRNA and ZM carrying the whole QQQ team now? What year is this? 2020?
No fucking kidding
they announced today what they are announcing later this month..?
lfg. love to see the spike today. cases up. race in Georgia tightening. Trump is starting his antics.
BRUH NIO IS STILL GOING UP?!! And here I thought I shouldn’t buy more calls at open 🤦‍♂️
QS tank a little more? 🥺
!Remindme 35 days
So I'm guessing the markets are pricing in a Blue Georgia.
getting that new rtx 3080 threadripper laptop
Shares because Gay, up 6%
So exercising the option on a call means I am initiating the contract and buying the 100 shares right? Sorry for the NOOB question I just bought calls that struck and I dont want to fuck it up
Tesla should be the only company allowed in the market
OP In your opinion do you think we have more room to drop or is 280 the bottom for now?
That’s what I’ve been saying, i guess people hate money
lol im red
Stripe??
http://gph.is/1auVod0
A couple weeks ago some 🤡 said $GOEV is gonna moon. Straight down the road from then.
Last dip before STIC turns into CHWY
This sub really cucked all the retards to get into PLTR and GME and to continue to stay in them with hopes and dreams LMAOOOO gullibility at its finest
There you go
So what’s the excuse for this sell off; Jan 6th?
Today is *definitely* the bottom for FDX 🤡🤡🤡
I’ve seen it done before.
Congrats my guy :)

If apple aquired tesla would that balance out the stock 🤔
Now is the perfect time to sell low and buy high on the bull trap. Peak autism.
TSLA puts here for a quick day trade?
...and a deafening silence.
I’d be so embarrassed to come on to CNBC and give Tesla a valuation of 180, like what the actual fuck? Lmao
Jesus I hope so.
It’s over $5. Technically not a penny stock anymore.
time to BTFD
Just bought a weekly cuz of you thanks stranger

🍎Aapl pleas go green again 🍏
god damn QQQJ. TTD is screwing the shit out of it
Jack ma is dead. Your calls will be too.
6k on the calls 2k on the shares
It’d be an economic war. We would just embargo them and watch them wither. Don’t get me wrong, it would hurt us a ton as well, but most of the “experts” agree that China needs us more than we need them.
Buy $BUG
Kill this man 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Bury him alive with no regard for human life
Because its the most retarded meme stock to date. NIO and PLTR are both solid companies in their start phase. GME is literally a dying business model at the end of its life. People are just trying to squeeze the last bit of juice out of GME before it rots and gets forgotten.
Me too man this sucks
5th
there u go nio, just like that 😩
Thank you for your sacrifice
Chi-NA
yeah I flagged them as junk back in the day, shit used to drive me nuts. Worked on gmail anyway
Damn why didn't I buy more than 10 shares of NIO fuck
Sure, let me just trade 5 times the world supply in 15 minutes, no biggie.

I'm not fuckin selling my GME shares

I die broke or ride this squeeze to the top - aint no bitch

down 15% because I am a real WSBer, not buying at the bottom like some bitch ass investor
I am holding CRSR but LOGI always outperforming 🤔
Lockup expires 3 days after the release of Q4 2020 earnings. That date hasn’t be announced yet, but guessing the lockup will expire roughly February 10, 2021.
Sounds pretty good, rgr
I bought at the top of the split too 😭, but they’re going to crush q4 earnings
Rcl puts?
Only if you have paper hands
OK boys, I've got my parachute and my long range radio.

My 2021 Roth IRA will be buying the dip today.
> Shorts continue to borrow shares of GME to try and drive stock price down. So bottom line, KEEP BUYING GME.

Ty
Unironically though, today’s movement is really looking to be pricing in a Democrat senate. Especially with how clean energy and electric vehicles are continuing to pump
anyone playing ROKU?
Where’s Wallace at man?!
Hahahahah
Same with VALE 💯

Even worse. You held overyear.
Somebody need to lose their job for this one.
Why Disney so done
Buy the dip!   Trading volume was like nothing, so it was just shorts and paper hands pushing the price down.   We all just need to buy a few more shares and hold!

All my calls are red. Better sell them now and buy back in at ATH
feb 132c aapl
Jesus Christ I’m retarded. Losing money as soon as I open a position. Should’ve stayed with BKNG puts. Not sure why google is mooning. Literally the only stock because I got puts mooning orbit now.

"Experts"
Americans are the new europoors. Way to start a new year u lousy fuckers.
Not sure with who but a few different sites mentioned it.
You go the right idea but the top trendline should be touching the candle wicks instead
I have a feeling when AAPL starts it’s pre earnings run up, its gonna be relentless. MM are dropping it low for a nice entry before the big year. AAPL 160 EOM 240 EOY
NIO to $75 by March. My calls would like that 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
MT and ICLN
Yes, since 2 months
Another 2500 GME shares at 17.50 on the dip. Pleas fly! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Everyone selling literally everything to buy shit coins and tesla. Thanks for nothing. The 2017 style dump is going to be glorious

Pls save my portfolio ICLN
Jeff who???
PLTR will dip to 18 but holding your shares will benefit you. Call holders got fucked this week after having a great run last week, but with their ever increasing contract acquisitions they are bound to scale up overtime. 

Expect 18 EOW but 50 EOY

I hope so, that's why I bought that date a month ago lol

If AAPL hits $130, it’ll dive off a fucking cliff due to a shit ton of stop losses being triggered.
What are you talking about it’s only up 0.73%
Your retarded stocks? 

No, our retarded stocks.

*communism intensifies*
COPE
I get it, I really do. Obscenely overvalued. But trying to time the dip would be really fucking hard, people have been pointing out how overvalued it is for years (and none of them have technically been wrong) but what the fuck does valuation matter if people are just gonna keep buying in? Valuation barely matters anymore in the context of hyped growth stocks. Will there eventually be a reckoning down the road? For sure. But knowing when that will happen will be real difficult to predict. Sheer presence in the S&P 500 will help insulate Tesla from massive drops for a while as it is, and throw in the massive population of retards buying shares and calls at all costs - you're fighting a really difficult battle. Plus, throw in the cost of the premiums on the options and I'd say you'd be better off just trying to do something else.

I just don't see the value when you look at cost/benefit. The risks are so much higher than you seem to be factoring in, and even if you're right, the "buy the dip" crowd will go nuts for a Tesla sell-off.
Dow -350 pts lol

You're "sold" the share by private holders before they hit the market. So you can potentially get them at a lower, pre-IPO price, which can be nice as seen with IPOs this year where the IPO price skyrockets upon listing.

WTF is your problem? Did PLTR rejected you in an interview? Is completely mediocre to wish others harm.
raising rates would be very good in a long run. It did help in the early 80s. But the immediate effect is huge surge of unemployment (remember, zombies have a lot of workers). And this is politically extremely unpopular. So often governments chose to drag zombies until the economy is collapsing. Think about Margaret Thatcher when she closed government supported coal mines. The amount of hate was enormous, but it was a right call

Down is an understatement lmao, that shit plummeted to the earths molten fucking core. If you had calls on that dip, they are now worth a penny.
TSLA needs to dip back to 710’s for another buy opportunity
DUDE, I DID EXACTLY THE SAME. FUCK MY LIFE. I would have been up like $4k more if I just stayed $NIO. I dont even believe in PLTR compared to NIO... If PLTR is not more than 6% up today I will just take the damn loss and go all in on NIO. That company is literally bound to be successful and no one can do anything about it.

Lemme get this straight: options dated for when a stock won't even be on the NYSE suddenly went worthless? Who would want to buy that if it's 100% a loss of money.

Nio's price target is 59 by big banks.  Does it hit 55 today? yea or nay?
Bought the dip @ 17.89 💎👐💎👐💎👐💎👐💎👐. Up to 2200 shares
Jump in before we pump, don’t be scared it’s okay
just would like to say i upped my gme shares by 100 another 1700 in 😎
$MT TO VALHALLA🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
If you are holding on to solar or weed stocks / calls, just imagine what will happen if polls are right and dems take sen.ate tmrw, and what that will do to those stocks.
WHY IS MY PORTFOLIO NOT 100% ARKK ?!
I would if I knew how - don't have any coins. Too retarded to award properly but knee-deep into gambling money on meme stocks. Yup \[x\] Belongs here.
Damn this sounds like total bullshit but it's formatted so well, IDK!!!
In their stats maybe, doubt they only have 60 cases per day.
What a dynamic day
On Friday, I thought "can't wait for the markets to open on Monday" and nearly punched myself in the ear.
I’d never do something so dumb
cuz it’s a trash stock that went up too fast 😂 why else lol you actually have to be a true wsb retard to not know that

Getting rekt

This picture is from a video from the channel “Life According to Jimmy”
feel like a retard cause I laughed at someone’s dd on here when it was like at 12 dollars I woulda been rich
For the algo: 

AAPL is the best option call play. I have made so much money trading aapl. AAPL makes big money moves. I love aapl. Thanks Tim. AAPL $250

Good shit! it's going to 570 this week btw
Nope. Holding shares. But made $1000 from selling CCs to the smoothbrains like you here
just opened short 100c 1/29 🤡
Bought another 50 at 17.22. I'm a simple man. If it drops further I buy more.
If u like amd. U like tsm
Shoutout to the bitch who convinced me to panic sell my TSLA calls at open
Holy fuck what’s going on with ZM
500k+ gme shares were just bought. Cohen 13D filling on  wednesday  incoming boys:)
They beat expectations for car deliveries.
Mouse finally dipped?
Does reporting the Robinhood emails as spam stop them? I’m so fucking tired of getting two emails per trade. Especially when they come in 15 minutes later when I’m jerkin it
tsla 800 c 8 jan lottos?
Last to pump before crash (and first to recover after)
same, I'm only 50 shares in. suppose I belong in /r/babystreetbets, haha; but GME looks so effing promising!
[deleted]
Who’s the guy who made a fuckton of money in 2020 and said his next yolo play is XL? cause I am getting fucked by that
This market disgusts me sometimes.
MT is up 8% today! Steel Gang....ASSSEEMMMBLLLLE💪😤💪
Sell short term NIO calls today or wait until tomorrow opening?
[deleted]
GME I thought we had moon rockets. :/
Thoughts on going into PLTR? wouldn’t mind a call or so at this price
Why do people bother flipping houses I flipped 2 but it’s a lot easier making money in the stocks all you have to do is push buttons house flipping you have to work your butt off I don’t get it
Come on GameStop go a little lower so I can close out my covered call.
It’s just not in the same realm and pretending it is is a diminishes the severity of their ongoing issues.
TSLA & NIO 🙏😤
you missed the dip to sell your puts? u retarded? Only way is up from now
GME pleas fly again
Yeah, it means not to get into GME.
AMD making my account rise from the ashes. It was the one that put my account in the ashes of course, but whatever.
Sirjackalot just a pump and dump tool. Don't follow him guys in this company.
Buy that apple dip thank me later
WHO DID MCD KILL TO BE DOWN FUCKING 2.3% TODAY WHAT THE FUCK
Haters are all butthurt they can’t read and bought weekly calls. My June calls are with you to the end Godfather.
And just like that, I'm green on GME again
Means End Of Drought 🚀🚀🚀🚀
GME was just playing a silly prank on us 🥺
Yeah I'm closing positions to have liquidity if markets dive again. Also, to not get shafted by margin.
[deleted]
Hope you bought that gme dip you chimps
SuBae you Minx 😍
NIO back to meme status
[deleted]
Think we still have some room to crash
Well I’m now a IPOC bagholder
all my money + margin in gme/mt 75%/25%


wish i could buy the dip 😭
NVDA why weren’t you making such moves a couple of weeks ago!? 😤😤😤😤
Upvote for my new wallpaper. Thanks comrad.
Why are travel stocks drilling today? Thinking of buying mickey mouse and ccl dip
Your calls been Jack Ma-ed
NIO NIO NIO
Don't worry, they will close for you when they expire mwahaha
I don't know what shit SPACs you have but mine are all up
Wtf....spy...you better keep tanking just for a little bit 😔😔😔
Sold my AMZN, bought AMZN puts.


You should probably buy AMZN now if you’re serious about making money
Uh oh. Welp... that’s sucks
GME RALLY 🚀
why is that?
What’s up
Wrong
Since the age of 12 or so, every time I'm in a group of people shouting, i start shouting "SELL SELL"
What a gay day
It better be at 50$ at may
[deleted]
Can you 🐻🌈stfu we already knew it was gonna dip hope you lost a few thousand before you paper handed
tsla $800 EOW
Looks like someone big is buying up GME 👀
buy SQ
When they get the rocket flying you will never see it at $23 again - SPCE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Anyone whose been gobbling up shares over the red days you are in luck keep gobbling buying the dip and pray holiday numbers are fantastic and ICR goes well and we get a 13D with a bigly increase 🚀🚀🚀🚀 actually any one of those means 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I believe brother!!!   RC > JC
Bers r FUCK
Somehow timed the bottom with gme calls I guess

Why the fuck is amd up 5%??
Kinda homo if Nio doesn't go to 55 today

Yeah! And some are women as well!
Does anyone know why quantumscape (QS) is down so much today? I’ve been thinking about buying
Inverse this for tendies
don't tell me to take puts and not even give me a position to start with. way too much leg work for me
Just got marked as a patterned day trader. Fuck, what happens if you can't close your calls?  Also, can I buy more calls?
Nothing like a good pump and dump with rocket emojis to start the new year
Yes, it's now or never
I was referring buying low and selling high intraday after a week of red. but intuition works too.
All hype, no logic. As I was going to point out to the comment you deleted, even a fractional amount of DD will show that ACB is a massive financial mess.
[removed]
fuck should have got into ttcf earlier
Totally up to you. I’d wait til next week’s ICR showing and most likely reported holiday sales before doing anything. This morning [https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) shows 200k shares shorted. This week will be bumpy, next week is tangible news.

Well at least PLTR is going back up.
GME RISEEEEE
$ASO looking strong. Huge upside growth potential. Premiums low - take a look.
$280c 6/18/21
WTF GME is erecting back. CTRL+Z
Just doubled my PLTR positions and its now half my portfolio. 

Sorry to fellow bagholders when this thing nose dives to $10 in the next 30 mins
June exp is good it's up to you if you another play then sell if not hold
Norway—> Northway —> North = Up —> TSLA up..., how did he miss that signal?
now lets see if the VIX falls off a cliff in the next 30 minutes - hour
Go Ninja go ninja go

Have you paid attention to any of the DD posted here
Need you tards to all buy NIO to break 53.8 please and thank you
Cohen buying more GME today.. filing will be tomorrow or Wednesday. Bought more Feb 20's
haha GME PUTS printiiing, dump that sheeeit boys
BTFD
Lol happens to us all bro.

At least you locked in 120%. Can’t be mad with that.
this is GME to ground control...
Dont get me wrong me too am a GME shareholder but this mtfk is an emotional lesbian alright
Is this satire?
What’s your PT? Yea she’s been flat for 3-4 months
What the fuck just happened

You bet against tsla didn't you? Rip
Same but now idk whether to sell
Cramer
8 consecutive red candles on SPY's 5 minute chart today. I'm no TA voodoo witch doctor, but that's gotta reverse
I have this position. 3400% is from .01 to .34 but if you actually invested you spend .05 on that contract.  Up 600%.
Like I said, on a fucking platter, captain fagbear.
I don't think I truly found a tenbagger yet, so nothing to make old man proud. I posted few times about stocks that I see as a good value. Will do so in the future too about some of the positions that I'm currently building.
Feels like it’s gonna stay at 220 for the entire year...

What is everyone’s predictions of NIO before Jan 15th 2021
"Guys" isnt an inclusive term Cramer some of us have titties
Mainly expectations of democrats winning senate is my guess.
Yeah scotland already did it, 100% going into national lockdown
Biden has been talking about it for awhile
I was wrong and I'm sorry Vito.
We can stop China and damn the aftermath? You're right. We totally can wake up tomorrow to sirens and the preppers taking cover in their fallout shelters.

A presidential SMS hits all of our phones "Look! I am on the way out and now you're all vaporized."

Second SMS "Good News! The only places that were bombed aren't OUR kind of people. Oklahoma City is untouched. Looks like we might have the popular vote now."
So glad I didn't sell GME  [😭](https://emojipedia.org/loudly-crying-face/) [😭](https://emojipedia.org/loudly-crying-face/) [😭](https://emojipedia.org/loudly-crying-face/) In Cohen I believe.
link?  i'm not selling, i just wanna see what stupid shit they are saying.
They warning not to get in gme...that only means one thing
Jeff bezos ate him
Market dribble down until Jan 7?
MT!! Steel gang stronk!!

Am I the only one whose Robinhood is working perfectly fine?
hold
Really appreciate the discount on GME stocks. Picked up more shares(cash).
Why would you even buy into that pos. 

REEEEEEEEEEE
SPY CEO supposedly being replaced on Jan 20
Buy the DIP!!!
This has been a tough stonk to trade for me as well.

Gainz is Gainz. Could have just as easily dropped. Good for you!
Holy shit. Even if marijuana is legalized in the US, ACB is the last company that will profit. You will see a huge bump in share price if MJ is legalized and Georgia goes blue. But at one point or another reality is going to set in that ACB is basically bankrupt and is surviving off of dilution alone.
Fuck sake, Nio taking off but GME ruining everything.
Warning to all bingo gang! Not saying sell, but def be prepared for a drop sometime this week. But who knows, might not happen.
# HEY LOOK PLTR IS AWAKE
Did you join in or watch a quick 150% gain pass you by from the sidelines?
QUICK! Everyone pile into hyperinflated tech stocks while we wait out the second wave of lockdowns! Nothing could go wrong!
QS still has a more promising future than GME

Edit: and I didn’t pump it, I said I wanted to DCA in 😂
The only good and safe play for the next month or two is ZNGA. Be at peace.
I guess TSLA joining the SP500 didn't stop it from being meme worthy.
Pls explain
Bull trap
[deleted]
You got time.
As in switch to drilling down
PLTR rising from the depths of Satans asshole
No , it broke out , AMD will only go up from here. You missed out so much gains.
lol gg
Pls explain what this chair joke is
You know the market is rigged when the price chart looks like big seismic graphs no one in real life can do that, that shit is not normal, it’s  computerized manipulation. Day trading is for dummies.
It do go down 😞
It's finally FUBO reversal time. Deadass. In for a few thousand shares at 26.70
Best way to start a year

How fucking more contagious can this shit get? The fuck?? Did it invent teleportation or something I mean what the hell.
Baba puts?
Ride out this $740 1/15 TSLA call in hopes ppl dump their $600 in or cash out now a quick 30%

Just remember, floor is pretty secure at $16 with Cohen's 9mil share purchase. Unless he's looking to lose money on GME, I think it's still at a very appealing price.
What did you call me?!
really need a big week out of NET
amd about to break 96

PTON puts kill me every time even when it goes my way. Bought this morning, saw profit, popped a rod, went to slap the ol' palm tree and came back to 0.
I'd keep holding off, but I expect the reversal this week
Best time to buy in a while bro. Gl
After 6-1 split sure
Too high, IMO... & Elon’s.
I hate myself for believing the GME smoothbrains here 😒😒😒😒
Being generous I’ll give it +12% in 3 weeks
True - I need to step away for a minute.
VXX calls saved my portfolio
should i buy nio rn
Yepp BigFuckingTendies down like 6% for no reason :(

What does this mean brother
shit I did
Jesus effing Christ FDX. Fuck right off with this bullshit. If you’re looking for a potential big play enter a long FDX position now
You'll be alright
Fair enough, can't fault you for a bit of added risk. June is past April, which is supposed to be a critical month. Could be a good time but to be honest I haven't done enough DD to really recommend it.
CRSR, posted it on here. Have bought 3 more of the Feb calls since then as well
within the realm of possibility a signifianct strike on the US happens with a transition of power, PLTR can prevent it.

Why are all the chip makers up? I can't find any news
[removed]
If you can't stand the volatility, this is probably not for you. Don't complain when it swings up later though. If you did not expect volatility I don't know what to say, but it is never too late to read the lengthy DD that comes with its own PDF, that discusses the volatility issue specifically.
Please explain?
fucking NIO not stopping

🚀🚀🚀💦💦💦
They're banning the sale of them, not the ownership. Open a dealership on the border and sell to clients remotely and deliver the car into the state for them.
BABA is gonna moon when they find jack ma’s body
Exactly that. 

Well spotted on this one.
cant get wrecked if you bought in at $10 lol
W shaped recovery
Link?
just got bought out.
see my other comment in this branch or look into my older posts.
It’s a market. There is no “they” it’s other idiots selling. 

If what they are selling is worth more than its exercise value, the market price will reflect that. So those options will cost more on the market than the value they get when exercised
More infectious sure but not necessarily more deadly
GME gang holds on
Time to jump on the GME train I guess
This is what’s known in the animal kingdom as a “stupid move”
RemindMe! One week

Not really, i Iike watching people who FOMO’ din destroyed. Atleast apple was obvious, would never short it though
If it dips but honestly idk if it will

Have you tried sleeping with a ~~textbook~~ computer under your pillow?
yea march
I saw PLTR was going down so I bought a put and now it’s flying up. You’re welcome
Same with Etoro
im wondering the same
sadly yes, after his base shrugged at the Russia tapes, the Ukraine tapes, and of course the "grab 'em" tape ... it's pretty much over
good stuff brotha. what was the catalyst for today?

GME is a failing brick and mortar retailer. PLTR is fairly valued at $50B for a service company...

Whoa, Tone 🖐
Because the TSLA bears are all dead

The real question is why do we buy anything besides TSLA

 I practice what I preach, so you can see my older posts and I’m long in most of the stocks I listed. I do have some positions that I’m still building up and they are undisclosed, but that’s no more than 1/3 of my longs. Best performers so far are SIG (entered 16, now 28) and FSM (entered low 6 to almost 9 now).

"Selling at the ask"...if u want a fill, you need to sell between bid and ask. U got lucky. Jeez. No wonder everyone on rh loses money.
Not a good idea to buy into a company making a loss per share...?

WTF happened to that pre market hype?
Just buy stonks, they only go up!

Short to volume ratio has been down for the past few trading days. I’m curious what will be displayed at EOD. Is this Melvin desperately shorting or is it a genuine sell off?

I don’t think it will spike past ATH in 3 weeks but the dip is bottoming, I choose to believe
My boss bought $4 calls last may. He is going to retire soon. This is the most sure-fire way I have found to get promoted so far.
Nice!  That candle this morning was crazy.  I saw 1/15’s at .18 and missed it.  Shot up so fast
Is this a v shaped recovery
Need to stop buying stupid shit and just buy leaps in companies I know and believe in
I swear TSLA always thrives the most on red days lmao
If you bought GME shares it isn't a big deal. If you bought GME calls then you're dumb because we said to buy GME shares.

How can McDonald’s lose when the McRib is back? It just makes no sense
I think it's just the whole market shifting toward the reality of no easy virus resolution 

Gaming/consumer computer stocks up like AMD, NVIDIA, and Intel, pricing in continued work at home/gaming

Blue apron up again, which just anecdotally is a shit stock but which rips upwards on virus news

CRL is up big; a solid play but usually doesn't move quickly, but does on virus news similar for research reasons

Not that there's no other possible reason for AMD up, but all of these moving together is what I've been noticing in the past after virus sentiment changes
“Entire net worth expires next week!”
Gotta be retarded to make retarded money. My unrealized losses is such a small fraction of the realized gains from my stupid ass other moves lol

What you mean? My watchlist is all green. TSLA, NIO, LI, XPEV. I’m rich today 😳
I have the worst fucking timing
It would be pure profit if they were actually a software company like MS. Unfortunately, they're still at the point of being consultant for hire, so no, not even close. That's why their valuation is comical for what they provide.
Just made the NYSE opening bell my ringtone. I now get a boner every time I receive a call
You can go to their website and download a pdf for their holdings in each sector

Fuck PLTR
Prepare yourself for the next XPEV run to $70!
tsla is literally the embodiment of stocks only go up
I made that mistake this morning. Sold all my Tesla calls for a measly 120% profit and then jumped into dog shit. Should have waited and just bought the TSLA dip.
Now that the pussy hands holding PLTR have sold, moon mission is back on boys 🚀🚀🚀🚀😎
Mrs. Watanabe = Mrs. Soprano

Fuck melons gona be richer than bozo. A month ago people were like "TSLA woUlD hAVe tO GO to 900 for that!" Lol
From looking at past ARK dips, it usually takes them like a month to recover from past ATH dips. We have 3 weeks left imo

Is there any reason to keep GME? Should I be playing the long game? I mean the organization itself is awful

Nope
Use your fucking brain dude are we in the land of the free or the land of smol pee pee
Lol, ok Dr. Burry...
I bought as much dip as I could.  As soon as I'm green though I am dumping half.
PLTR  said SIIIIIKE
If it ever dips, Ill buy some NIO leaps. Fuck it, I'll pay the premium.
Hit piece dropped this morning from motly
Its ok i can just buy more and lower my average price 🥲
Ok I can’t sit here and stew all day about whether or not to buy Tesla, I’ll fucking buy it. 

Question for you all - would you buy shares or call options if you were buy Tesla today?

You’re right. 😔
Nice PLUG dip.

Why are we downie
imagine not investing in TSLA and hating money.
weird right? it's almost like hundreds of thousands of people are dying miserable and alone from an airborne pandemic
HOLY PLTR
That’s a good idea. They can’t get you if you’re a Scientologist
robinhood how about 0.0% borrow fee for using your shitty product
Alright, I'm paying attention to PLTR again...
+3,400% today lol
The stock market doesn’t even wanna do its job this Monday. Classic.
Why does rh keep having these strokes??
You lose 100% of the battles you don't fight.
Told ya!
PLTR LET'S GO
I’ve been in since august and my average cost is far lower Than the $17.30 it’s trading at now but even still days like today hurt. Lol these posts help a lot knowing that we have a whole army of people buying the weaknesses. Wouldn’t mind a good news cycle to hit the tapes soon though.
White pants after New Years smh
Yes, but we enjoy those things when they (mostly) pay. If you get fucked like it's happening right now even the most retarded of retards will stop playing or try something different. Give it some time, when the market goes back to it's "normal" perma-bullish condition shares will be considered gay and boomer stuff again
where are you buying these ? is the ticker NGA i only can find LEV edit.. never mind i’m dumb
I don't understand here, if you had only bought each dip you would be up.
Good volume on PLTR green candles
legit nail biter
Wer ist berd?
So what your telling me is to not sell??
So you can buy the dip?
Definitely a good time for July calls.
Holy shit, were did PLTR come from lol. Was down heaps last time i checked.

PLTR shook out the paper hands and decided to fly again
Yes
China ev baby
Holy foook TSLA!
What happened to AAPL
PLTR is cock teasing us??
In a very real way ali baba does not compete with Amazon. 

Amazon is primarily a retail store where ali baba is a business to business sales portal for buying products manufactured in China at scale by individuals and companies based outside China. Its a portal to china's factories. 

They're different business models. 

Oh jack Ma is being punished by the Totalitarian Oligarchy that is the Chinese political party. He's being punished for saying something that makes sense out loud that makes the one political party allowed in China look bad. 

He may in fact be dead. But its likely he's just in prison somewhere.
Perfect entry point for AAPL, this is the floor, only up from here until earnings.
TSLA is now worth $700B
Anyone who sold GME deserves a ban
Yeah... we’re only up 2% today. *HARD*
We’re slowly leveling brother, that means Cathie working on her spreadsheet

Trying to keep people from being impulsive babies who freak the fuck out and forget everything the second they see a stock in the red. Kind of like how bears come out of the shadows and claim that they were right all along as soon as a stock goes down in value

If GME holds $17 today, we are in a very strong position to climb slightly in tomorrow's premarket before plunging to $16 or maybe even $15.

There is pretty much a <1% chance for Stripe and a 0% chance for Starlink.

People need to stop repeating this bullshit.

There is 0 reason for Musk to go the SPAC route, IPO route, or any route with Starlink other than shits and giggles. He has no lack of access to capital as everyone is throwing it at him hand over fist on ungodly favorable terms. The SEC notice about being able to raise capital on a DPO means that if he needed capital he could put forth a 1% stake and it would moon instantly regardless of the price with 0 middlemen.

Tl;dr - 16k (shares, since some of you retards can’t figure out the $ sign) deep in this biatch and buying more with selling my other investments

Didn't expect to find this here
Correct.  Also, if anything, how badly their website sucks for ordering computer parts might accelerate RC's takeover and send GME to the moon.  Look at the piss-poor selection of gaming desktop parts, literally just a few motherboards, with no reviews, price comparisons, etc.  There's no fucking reason right now for anyone to buy a damn thing for PC gaming from Gamestop's ecommerce website right now, it sucks even by Boomer standards.  (It would be one thing if they were selling these parts in-store; at least people could have instant gratification).  Hence why Papa Cohen needs to get in immediately and make them clean their act up.

Yep. Shakespeare of our time.

Kicking myself for selling my MT calls last week and keeping CRM.
I thought that data showed that most people want the version with a disc drive.

Anyhow, people seem to have transitioned from a "sudden short squeeze" narrative partially into one where Ryan Cohen comes in and overhauls the business into a digital gaming powerhouse. Or something. 

There have been a lot of posts with rockets.
That's the spirit GME still has some gas in the engine.

Spy red.  But my holdings are green? What is this dark magic!? 2021 Already trying to make me it's bitch early before it really fucks me.
lol, you have positions in PLTR, NIO and GME?

You're the literal reason I love reading this sub.
Done trading for the day until RH can accurately tell me how much money is my account. Jesus Christ

Because the stores closing are part of dedensification (not very useful to have two shops in the same mall sort of thing) and people are actually happy to spend more to buy the version with the disk drive (at least you can resell a physical game, you can't resell a downloaded one). This is all available from the numerous DDs posted on this subreddit.
American stocks are just volatile because of the upcoming state elections and will shoot up when the winner is known, whoever wins. Buy the dip

Nice, big baller
Probably leniency to actually get ipo'd.

IRS probably didn't care as much but if they are going to be a publicly traded company they would need to comply more strictly.
Nah I don’t play with junk stocks. It’s just hilarious to me how you mofos pump this pos company and now it’s come back to rip you a new one.
Good
GME not stopping
cry
lol

It can go down much further. You can tell by the way it's gamestop
Jan 11th GME is going to present at ICR under the "technology" category instead of the "retail" one - that change happened quite suddenly before Christmas.
Run offs have all kinds of fun risk, but it’s the possibility of what happens after the electoral college business is done that’s probably having some impact on VIX.  Not a ton of political stability for the market to work with.
One of the best books out there... Ignsoc!!  “War is Peace, Freedom is Slavery and Ignorance is Strength.”

Keep telling yourself that dude. Post that loss porn
Really fucking glad I got my shit assigned on Friday now
Duhhhhhhhh
Not going to lie, nice to see those realized losses zeroed out
These first 40 mins were exhausting. I’m gonna take a nap to rest up my bruised ego. I might check some work emails later but for now 😴

Good luck my fellow crayon eaters
I sold my WMT leaps on the opening bell because they were hardly moving and right after I sold its moving up.
Magine this for one second, each morning when the market opens you wait 30 to 45 minutes to let the volatility die down. So when you do eventually decide to buy every single position that you open immediately reverses from a steady strong climb and you proceed to lose 40% of your portfolio in five minutes

Edit: couldn’t be me
Feel that
When Creed Bratton gets in trouble he just transfers his debts to William Charles Schneider
Picked up some DKNG LEAPS. Feelin good
If you sell you are going to be grounded for a month mister!
GME will probably drop another day or 2, but it will start going back up by the end of this week. If you’re going to buy the dip I’d at least wait until tomorrow.
If dumping funds into SAVE and LUV shares don’t pay off a year from now, I’m going to be one salty mf
What if we all just rooted GME to go down... idk it might go up. Inverse WSB
Jagx 👀 and acst 👀
I left AMZN. Honestly whenever that POS starts going up again, whoever fucking held you fucking deserve to make money.

Yeah, I had divested from QS and then was talking to my Bro-in-law and he was going on and on and onn about solid state batteries so I was like "fuck it" and bought a couple shares on the 28th at 115/share.

*sad Animorphs bear cover noises*
Why for the past month have we been up bigly pre market then dump morning than flat all day
We really don't know much (so it goes with pre LOI SPACs), but PSTH is the largest SPAC ever, has many billionaire investors, led by Bill Ackman, the tontine 2/9 warrant structure, as well as some big name rumors (Stripe/Bloomberg).

I also feel that the market is overvalued, so I feel safest with my money in SPACs and green energy right now.

There are two senate seats on the line. If Dems win both the senate will be split 50-50. That means that the VP can be the tie breaker. Democrats will control both the house and senate which means a lot of stimmy. Overall bullish.

Let‘s hope. Went in today and it bonked me pretty hard.
I haven’t really touched my portfolio in a few months. I thought prices were wild back then. I’ve been waiting for a couple weeks for a few plays knowing there should be a stimmy bump. 

Some kind of bump apparently already happened. This is something else. I can’t buy at these prices. I can’t do it. I’m also not gonna bet against them.

PLTR get in now. This thing likes to return
The two most popular stocks right now (GME, PLTR) are shares/leaps plays, unless you are retarded. Selling covered calls seems to have taken some traction recently too, probably because many got buttfucked by playing OTM calls in those two stocks and are now considering a safer, but not completely homosexual, approach. Makes sense and memes apart is nice to see people avoid YOLOs in favour of bagholding shares bought at ATH, it's a small improvement, but an improvement nonetheless!
You are a next level retard if you’re still holding GME in 2021
They won't make money until 2027 and that's only if the science experiment works out. Speculation only for now.
I consider myself a man who likes buying dips, but some of these today are 🥴
MT with that cameo at the end

Up eight percent today fellas

The Elon tweet is priceless

Okay boys and girls! Lets play how low can SPY GO?! Right now it’s down almost .30%. And my dumbass bought calls ending EOW at what I thought was the dip. Can we get this thing any lower? The answer is always yes
I just keep buying not shitting you I don’t even care

What's my boy AMD doing
Gambling on earnings is always fail
It's my fault guys, I sold my GME and PLTR shares before new years

Sorry 🤷‍♂️
Link or ban
False. If you're in something that's drilling you're just in the wrong thing. Dems flip GA, weed stocks are going to moon
Lmao morons using China-owned Webull. How’s Xi’s dick taste today?
I bought calls at open
holy shit buygo
Ouhhh okay sorry I thought u meant, “there are many people selling on Amazon/ebay/Shopify, who the hell relies on Alibaba anymore?”. Clearly I misunderstood you, sorry.
You're a 🌈 year
Bangbus really banging me hard right now fellas
Apple just took a $10K bite out of my portfolio. Fuckers.
let this be a lesson as to why we call meme stocks meme stocks. Don't simp for them. The whole point is to get in, make money and get out n not be the one stuck holding the bag
Still holding on GME. 💎👏
I thought the whole point of the squeeze theory was to buy shares
I thought CRSR would save me from the gang bang but it just quietly got in line. 😢

SPY PUTS FINALLY PRINTING

Did just PLTR have found its bottom? 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

\+5% and to Mars and beyond!
Proud of you
DKNG has fucked me so hard this month. 
Fucking degenerate gamblers.
Panic sold my aapl calls 🥰 still have my puts though
I thought your money would wipe away the tears, and it did but... That hurt a lot more than I was expecting. ;(
Is this the end for WSB? Finally found a group of retards I can vibe with and every meme stock is falling like a house of cards
at this point ive lost so much that selling would be mega retard
This guy is on the news every other fucking day locking something down this is getting fucking absurd
Lol I love knowing some people probably just royally fucked themselves by selling amd at open 😂
What expiration?
Here’s your TSLA dip
GOEV gonna punish me for buying this dip?
don't worry we can shoot ourselves together, are you holding shares or calls?
Because I suck.
I'm furious i didn't pick up spy puts at open
Will pltr hit 20 or 30 first? Place your bets!
Aight: counterclaim.

Trump caused an actual recession. Why is blue bad? Did we stop making money from 08-16?

This looks good for a lot of sectors like electric and solar that are already doing phenomenal

Attention Motherfuckers,

Stop dumping PLTR you toilet paper handed bitches. It doesn't need to drill just because the meme sentiment changed. I have it on good authority Shitron agents are shitposting anti-PLTR memes.  
THanks U dum fuks
We dumping
not even a dead cat bounce for GME
Doesn't WeBull know i'm tryna lose my stimmy this AM?! WTF
Because I spend $300 a year buying monster energy drinks but refuse to invest in what I believe in... I’ll warn you all before I go long.

Maybe  500% run up over three months might be a little over-ambitious
Aight, bought more
It’s gonna get downvoted to hell but whatever last minute craziness that the republicans and mango 🥭 pull trying to keep office. Also factor in the high likelihood that protests in DC and elsewhere may turn into outright rebellion. No one wants to hear it but it’s getting priced in.

TTD never recovering
Bought more, no cash left now but later today or tomorrow 1.5k should arrive at my broker. Don't think it will go below 16 cause Cohen

**DUMP EEEEEEEEEEEEEEET**
steel gang lets go
im 21 i live in a poor kinda country... I got a TSLA share with 100+ profit, what do i do
How about no revenue for 5 years and a shit load of shares hitting when lock up expires?
Lost a lot during the last two weeks but made a 4k gain today with zm and mrna. Won't try to make up all losses in one day so I am going to buy some shares and call it a day today
I am targeting IPOF personally.
What are the plays here? Feb 12, 30Cs?
Pipe dumping
Just a reminder that NIO day is this weekend. Price action fuckery is gonna happen just before the moon
MELT UP

Got some catalysts coming up the next few weeks. Have faith
Getting out asses handed to us!!!!

Biggest pump and dump on NYSE in a while I'm surprised this was legal.

No just not be red. Like the last 5 days.

It's fascism. A merger of corporations and the state, where the corporations are still nominally privately owned. 

If it were socialism, the government would install leaders from within the government itself.

Today is much like "My Shits Fucked Up"
Game Over PLTR
Fed system is different than your state and local prosecutors.  Federal system being at 94% is more due to the fact that they won’t move forward with the prosecution unless it’s a near damn slam dunk case with evidence.

im sure one of these days the shitbox RH servers will SAVE me money and I will be happy but as for now they have only cost me.......
didn’t the bag holders buy in at like 10?
Buy GME at s discount price asap
But there are no rocket emojis?
The fed didn’t buckle until the repo incident in September ‘19. The Christmas correction slowed rate hikes, but they were still intending to continue those ops till Repo broke.
This only makes that more likely, right? Easier to make money if it pumps to $900 before falling to $450 than if it just corrected now
Some pretty wild action today, this ain't the sell off I've been expecting though
STEEL GANG ROLL CALL
Serious question: How much more can TSLA grow? The market cap is approaching 1 trillion

Managed to pull a quick 4K on open with a tsla 715 and 720c purchased Wednesday. Didn’t think 730 would actually happen when I jokingly said 730 on Monday morning last week.
What are they scared of? The Dems winning? Cause that doesn't seem like a long shot

Pretty sure there’s no news.  If you buy more here, make sure to save a bit of cash in case it dips further.  I think the low of the dip would be around $15, but I don’t have a crystal ball.

Yea me too luckily I have Robinhood as well??? Lol thought I’d never say that

The above is more about the reason for the timing. The reason for the crash would be because it's retardedly overvalued.

Well I didn't lose any money but Webull pick the wrong time to stop working...
TSLA left without me.
I'm not saying we as WSB. I'm saying we as the nations of the world. I'm not talking about reddit. I mean if we all banned together would could put a stop to it and liberate China. The issue is that no one wants to pay that price tag.
Let us know your next one so we can inverse.
Yes PLTR die, and take apple with you
I keep getting “System is busy, try again later”

Imagine buying shitstocks like GME
imagine buying at 105 haha lol how could an idiot be this stupid
NIO  EOW $60🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Sigh, it's fucked. Once lockup expired the stock will free fall. It needs to climb Jan Feb with the demos, interviews, news of contracts. We also need a strong earning report so retail holds its shares and doesn't panic dump.

This post tells me that tomorrow is time to buy GME
Wouldn't get your hopes up for a major dip, especially with earnings later this month

“my stonk that was insanely overpriced went down a bunch?”


“WTF?!”


lmao all the noobies
Is this the part where everything that is super green goes depression red, and everything red sprouts up a fucking jack and the bean stock sized bean pole.
Name calling does not equal being to emotional. It is just my way of expressing to someone how dumb they are. Maybe you’ll learn something.
Legit question, if like 98% of the float is under water how can Melvin even short it and attack as much thry are?
Buy the dip
Yeah buy more shares
“It smells of the ancients!”

Already lost my 600 stimmy on this dump lol anyone else?
It seems asinine to still buy TSLA now, but I'm tempted just to ruin all your calls when it inevitably crashes after I buy in.
Waking up down 3k and climbing.

Maybe someday AAPL would like to open and... stay green?
At least NIO's actually doing something. I keep poking GME but it's starting to look less like a rocket and more like a corpse.

Still in it, it's only a loss if you sell or it goes bankrupt but... GME pls.
Ignore all the DM's... today you have made people a lot of money. Looking forward to your next update post.

What the fuck is going on with AAPL?
Don’t sell GME you paper hand cucks
Yeah, I’m more worried about GME for sure. I got some stocks for the short term when people would be spending their stims on consoles. Hopefully it perks back up a little soon. Don’t want to lose too much on it.
If you’ve sold already, 31 minutes into 2021 trading year, go ahead and close your account now. You’ve lost already.

 A variant of the coronavirus identified in South Africa is more problematic than the strain found in the U.K., Britain’s health minister has said, as both strains continue to spread rapidly.

there's also not guarantee that you just get a Chapter 7 filing rubber stamped, "I made a high risk investment without fully understanding the total risks and now I owe $20k that I don't have in cash", does not sound like the it would pass the means test for a valid Chapter 7 filing, and the U.S. Trustee would likely succeed in forcing you to refile a chapter 13 claim, aka restructuring. Where you still pay your creditors and your credit still gets fucked.

Sold out of my Tesla stocks. How much more can this even go?
Fucking up my calls. Blew up 10k in like 2 weeks. Just fucking bagholding.

Shit did nothing but go down since I bought it
I’m taking these TSM Gains
Just added to MT. Still undervalued compared to price of steel. Feb Calls ftw
My Memefolio ain't looking so good either 😒
Has NIO reached the moon yet? No
Why is NET dropping?
Hopefully for me by the 15th.  Sold to open a bunch of mid $30s a few months ago
Is the market being gay because of the Georgia runoffs?
Damn 17... looks like theres no turn in back im holding till 0! 

I dropped another 160 dollars, BUY THE DIP!!!

Edit:its 18 were going to the moon! Im proud of you dip buyers
WHY THE FUCK IS MCDONALD'S DOWN $4
I said same when I worked there in high school
Yep everyone Is jumping on tesla
ENPH u just joined the SP500 would be cool if u stopped selling off
GME squeeze is more of a cult.  Imagine betting against billionaires with your 20k in shares.  They can keep the prices low for the next 100 years.  You guys are holding some sick bags.
I’m extremely leering of investing in China.  BABa has excellent fundamentals and the Ant IPO was all set to go.  The CCP wiped all that out on one fell swoop destroying hundreds of BILLIONS of dollars worth of value.
I’m long PLTR, but I will buy short term puts if needed so that it goes the right fucking direction again. That way id be long, short, and theta gang. Not sure how I could lose from there but I’m sure PLTR will make sure of it
Huge spreads and crazy IV. Not yet, friendo
Are Moderna puts free money?
Yeah I could’ve held onto Tesla, but what is the fun in thousand dollar returns daily?

I’m a retard god damnit!

I need the self loathing associated with riding calls down the slope because you know when you sell it’s gonna moon
Maybe I'll actually be able to tell the wife about [this terrible idea](https://imgur.com/a/RjfJPxJ).

Suck $45k into 12/8 ACB $9.5c at open.

**Almost $60k of gains in 20 minutes**.
#Why is PLTR so FAKE and GAY
[deleted]
Yep, shit company. Doesn't even price match anymore
We got pump and dumped
I know we just had a 3 day weekend, but can close the markets already

Guh
Fuck bald-head-Bezos and come to Daddy Musk bro
Ever go on TikTok? Up, down, up, down, up, down lol
TSLA TO THE FUCKING MOON!
I doubt some one with a 20k debt of this type will get any kind of reasonable loan if they get one at all here. Also depending on the bankruptcy you qualify and file for you may not owe anything let alone interest and your credit will only show it for 7-10 yrs
No one said this stock would only go up and never go down. Why would you wish for other people to be broke and out in the streets? That seems like a problem with yourself more than us. I want everyone in here to retire early and be millionaires. Good luck with your life, I hope this post made you feel better about yourself!
QS gang -200% wya
You should try options. My portfolio swings 11%+ a day. Already went from +12% to +5%  cause a stock dropped a buck
During a pandemic with shutdowns that is a great feat. Fuckin clown.

Nice that I have someone to blame for losing money
DKNG let's stop the whole going down thingy
nope
What’s funny is that when GME dips to 15-16 over the next week GME paper hands and 🌈🐻 will be panicking and laughing at GME.  Then when GME goes back to 20s all the retards will be asking when the dip will happen so they can buy.
It will hit 55 today
Get fucked retards
🤡
You’re on WSB and you’re looking to lecture me on risk? It was a 17% return and I took my profits asap. The fuck ❓
Yay nio go
$MT 🚀🚀🚀
Or flip that.  The word gets out that RH wont pursue people who owe them less than say 50g, then all the sudden people start yoloing their accounts and then never paying what they owe.  Either extreme is bad and wont work so yea I'd say they 100% pursue someone owing 20k.
Imagine not buying the BABA 225 dip L
"these calls are for march" i keep telling myself as they go down everyday

Until the next big thing was slipped in there so well...  I had to scroll back up to confirm and start laughing.
I think your gif is reversed. I shorted this as soon as I saw PLTR and moon mentioned in WSB...oops.. Was I not supposed to say that? My bad. I'll go count my money. Later boners.
u in NET, SQ, FSLY, UPWK, PLTR, APPS, GRWG, CHWY, CRSP by any chance?
Best Buy was the worst investment i ever fucking made
It's a good way to hedge the market though. Bet republicans as underdogs, buy GLD calls. If Dems win I expect gold spot price to go to past 2300 by Feb, and USD to take a shit.
Oh no, what are you in?

Step 1: go to college

Step 2: take out $50k in student loans

Step 3: pay off $20k debt and yolo the remaining $30k in gme.

Step 4: get ass raped by melvin and sell at a loss

Step 5: congrats, you now have $10k, you are a savvy investor.

By getting direct access to well-known and respected Sompo CEO Kengo Sakurada, Palantir CEO Alex Karp was able to forge a strong personal rapport that helped cement their [$500 million partnership](https://fastinform.com/sompo-to-invest-500m-in-palantir-technologies/). The relationship is built on more than business strategy alone. The tall American philosophy PhD holder and the elderly, powerful Japanese executive once engaged in a mock bout with ancient swords during Sakurada’s Silicon Valley visit. Those kinds of direct and memorable personal bonds are the key to achieving success in Japan.

It's a sign that you're using the #1 most best platform for retards.
You’ll regret it your whole life.
It listened!
it doesn't need to go up right after, im playing the long game. nio has good tech, good service, good price, good management, it has a moat, good roadmap and vision. number 1 in customer service, number 1 in convenience, government has close to 15% stake in the company, baas partnership with one of the top battery makers in the world
This happens with mergers and I expected to have to hold for a while
Dude! Learn from this. The price action tells you all you need to know. People want to own TSLA stock.
Amd 🚀
is that shit real?
is goev a buy here?

It’s ok to be jealous ❤️ I hope whatever you’re going through gets better and you come out a happy successful person

GME will be down to $5 and people will be like "Buy the dip!"
That's where I'm at currently... Pretty sure that's how it always works.

Rates will go up if we get runaway inflation and it starts hitting regular people pocketbooks in the form of food, gas, and energy. 

If inflation can be stored in assets, then the party will keep going.
Yea they trying to get on MUs game
Government controlled businesses are all fun and games until the other party gets control. I doubt you'd be praising such a system if Don Jr. became POTUS.
NIO, TSLA, maybe chips. GL retard
If Amazon goes to $3300 by tomorrow I will give my Alexa a friend.
Shorts are panicking buying up 1/15 24p. Depending on new directional info on 1/11 and holiday sales report 1/13, their efforts either A) are in vain as Cohen takes control or holiday sales were amazing or both. B) Cohen makes no moves and holiday sales are awful and they simply push out the timeline to unravel their short positions. C) they scare institutional investors and retail retards into panic selling every share they own. Don’t be retarded, be patient.

How do you all deal with the bad decisions that result in a 100% loss for that contract? I guess the smart thing to do is to use spreads so that doesn’t happen. Just happened to me and it really sucks man! I do not like it.
Weed stocks are a joke glad I'm only down 10%

That’d be interesting just to see who has lost the most in the world on Robinhood.
NIO you beautiful bastard
Pumped and dumped. Turns out that a company with no product till 2025 isn't worth $100 a share.
I hope all you GME paper hands get fucked.  For the last 3 months, GME has dipped 30% after hitting a high.  Guess what 22.35 -30% is?  $15.6.  Give it a week at it should go to 15-16 area, and then it’s gonna go up again.  Its not hard to understand.
I sold for 8 percent loss. I could have not been a bitch and just waited 10 minutes to make profit. But I put the order to sell last night. Really didn't expect to sell within 2 second of market open..
ROKU and BABA on discount.
PLTR is going to tank so hard and fast you sheep won't see it coming

No problem! Appreciate it!

COME ON PSTH there must be a takeover target here

&#x200B;

PSTH Takeover Targets:

E.g. Stripe, Airbnb

Acquisition Criteria:

&#x200B;

* Value investor with growth potential = attractive valuation relative to long-term intrinsic value
* Predictable, simple, free cash-flow generating; could be negative but should be positive within a reasonable amount of time
* Business moat with low disruption risk
* Not affected greatly by macroeconomic factors, commodity, regulations, interest rates, volatility 
* Strong balance sheet
* Has access to capital markets, but not dependent on it
* Large cap (between $10-$100b)
* Exceptional management and governance = management is trustworthy, experienced, talented, and competent
* “Acquire smaller pieces of superb business over which we have substantial influence, rather than controlling interests in lower quality businesses”
Not even a hint of green lol, what the actual fuck

China can overtake the US in all areas. But if you know who really runs the game and realize they can’t operate in China as effectively or have control like they do in the US, the US will always be on top. Won’t always be pretty.
same it’s ok
Done
It's early. Don't make drastic moves on the first hour of trading after a long holiday weekend. Lots of my shit is falling but I'm not touching a thing until tomorrow.

My NIO shares are printing today but that covered call I sold on Thursday is not.
Why’d WISH get shot down?
Life was so much easier before I got my friends into GME. Now they're pinging me every time it dips.
OP how you feeling right now?
it will drip down for like 4 days, and then WHAMMY, liftoff. If only I could buy the day before liftoff and not before day 3 of slow bleed like I have been...
1% to 6% is actually quite a leap.

Tsla went through 10 years of trading sideways and fighting shorts
Lmao
Anyone riding the silver train
VALE
Bro don't diamond hands. 60 end of year!
It is the reality, though. The market has been running on sentiment, not reality, ever since the March crash. Every time there is a small change in sentiment the market moves accordingly. That is why the large uptick occurred after the Pfizer vaccine results were announced, immediately followed by profit taking. That the market has been struggling to hold gains recently tells me that a correction is likely imminent. The only thing holding it up is retail and hot air. Smart money has moved or is currently moving to safer pastures.
I buy per week because otherwise I'd starve waiting for a red day
I can buy a $1 gaming pc from wish and Aliexpress so I’m chill
Bought the 85 calls back in March for about $10 each, realized the 90's were selling for $12-15 so sold them. Made my money back the same day and then diamond handed them until 2 weeks ago and started moving the strikes and dates around to make more money.
Y'all still have a chance for MT shares get innnn

Dear Cathie,
I think we might need some time apart. If you're going to shit the bed at market open 6 days of the past 7, I'm going to be forced to buy puts until you get straightened out. So I'm going to give you a little space and get back to making some righteous tendies until you're better. I'll be here when you're ready for me, but I can't keep losing like this. Love is love, but tendies is life.
Nio and ICLN 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
TSLA you da real MVP for holding up my ARKK shares.

Thoughts on PLTR as a long term hold. is this a good entry point? Also, bought GME at 20.80. Do I average down or just let it ride...
Oh no, I’m only up 10% now. BRB roping.
When Elon Musk says that he thinks that maybe the US response to the coof or something was anything less than perfect and then just conveniently decides to stop coming to Tesla and SpaceX board meetings or doing any other work for 2 months I'll eat my words. Until then, Fuck the CCP
I definitely felt like CHWY couldn't hold 100 let alone 108 but somehow held my shit instead of selling and it just sucks.

Robinhood is on its bullshit today. Saying I am down when steel is going to the moon.
If the American stock markets actually catastrophically fail at some point, it's either due to the literal apocalypse or some kind of socialist revolution that happens once material conditions get bad enough for the average person.  Either the markets go up forever and you make bank, or everything collapses and you're fighting your neighbors for rat meat and "money" is a distant memory after a week, or a a glorious revolution takes over, nationalizes everything, and actually provides for the people in a communist utopia.
Sold Boeing for a massive loss, what an absolute shit stock

Wage slave
Welcome to the end of the bull market
Whooshed right over me cause everyones so bullish on it buying this 7 layer dip. Lol
Lol PLTR at 40B is higher risk than TSLA at 700B according to the markets. You love to see it.
I hate INO so much. I held a big bag in the summer at the low 20's. Finally realized the company is a POS with a crap CEO. Dumped at $13 and it kept going down ever since.
"he bot?"

"daaahmmmppp eeeet"
I remember the kids game show. You had to know your cities and states to win the grand prize and there was a lot of running around.

I bought GE leaps when I saw the new CEO managed to right the financial ship and neutralize most/all of their bleeding. I dont think GE is going back to $50+ for a while but I absolutely think it doubles to $20 in the next year.

Oh shit. Really. Guess ya basic.

Yup! I hear that! I'm locked out of buying till Feb. So sad. Marked me as a day trader and I'm poor. :c feels bad.

 Mark my words. Baba to 256 by end of month.
Hold your horses
OH THANK GOD! I thought you said NIO!!!
Another day of TSLA carrying the rest of my trash portfolio
Robinhood=🌈
My man, you got it backwards. 

The Fed is desperately trying to create inflation to keep the economy growing. 

My personal macro theory is that it is failing because gas prices are still so cheap. With 20M or so people still out of work, cumulative miles driven by month is still down big time. If gas prices start to lift with unemployment still super high, it is stagflation time.
apple is super gay
I am from India. Based on your DD I got Indian equivalent of MT(Tata Steel). Already 300% up today. Thank you very much.

Dear diary:  turns out confirmation bias on WSB still in fact means I will lose money.
NIO is just getting started. It's gonna keep climbing until the end of this week in anticipation of NIO day. Then NIO will drop details of their new sedans, battery tech upgrade, battery subscription plan, self driving package, EU partnership, and NIO will keep rising for the rest of the year toward $100 as they hit each of their goals.
Illuminati/NWO initiation, planning the next pandemic to get richer bigly, etc, etc.

Don’t panic and buy the dip
WTF SPCE can you not?????
This is your last chance to buy PLTR over $20, boys.
Hahaha everything is going 🌈 across the board
Upvoting out of respect. What balls... or autism.
Yeah California is screwed. The RE oligopoly are making sure every single ballot measure to ease housing pressure gets defeated.

Bulls did all that work premarket, just to let this go flat.
there’s no way tsla can pump at this valuation.

## tsla: I’ll effing do it again!
If GameStop falls much further I'd love to average down... if i had any cash left 💎🙌
Holy fuck even T is green this morning
Ebay to the rescue
I thought I made a great call buying the net dip at 82

Under 20. Buy signal
MSFT investors played Cyberpunk, I see.

Every single morning lol
Update on MT sold up 30 % and buying later date next dip
WHY WONT RH UPDATE MT DAILY TOTALS
Because it has no fundamental support. Just cocaine and gambling.
Where were you when PLTR was kill?
Losing thousands not being able to get out of AI right now.
PLTR being gay
There is nothing worse than selling formerly heavily green options at a loss
Errr... Really bad ones

Jimmes do be rustled ngl tbqh rn plsfly
I almost had a fucking heart attack, robinhood's chart glitched out and showed a massive downwards spike and half my money was missing. It corrected a few seconds later but WTF. That's NOT okay
This aged well......
Ahahahaha wtf?
I actually got really “lucky” as being born a Native American in a federally recognized tribe and taking advantage of using the Section 184 loan from the HUD program so I only have to put down like 2.25% with a competitive interest loan and can leave the rest to compound on ICLN / TAN to hopefully kill the mortgage in 15 instead of the 30 

Thanks a lot man I appreciate the help. Eased my head for awhile
GME please fly
Solar is fucking invincible

I’m trying to buy Nio but it just says N/A for shares and I haven’t received my order confirmation hoping I’m not losing money!!!
Etoro down while gme drills wtf
GME got hit hard, not sure if by shorts, puts or what, but it is fluctuating all over the place now..

IB shows stocks available to short before 7.30 as 400k, then it fell to 40-something thousand, now back to 200k-ish. Guess that might be why.
Wtf Is it dropping for
I got you man 👨
Bring back Ali!
BABA to finish in the green today. Get your calls
I fully expect that right after my 1/15 options expire PLTR will moon like crazy
PLTR decided to take my lunch money and run today 😂
Selling PLTR is anti-American
It's a 1 year liquidation sale bro. They are following the Wal-Mart strategy of "lowest everyday prices, guaranteed". If you buy high and sell low, this is your dream company.
PLTR announces 1 year new contract for $22m.

Stock falls on the news.

The fact that there are still 20M people unemployed and real estate is boosting 10% annually is not something I am prepared to tolerate. 

Eventually, it is going to matter that 20M people are going to be permanently out of work.

It's had a pretty quick run up, I'd be hesitant to buy anything over 28 a few months out now.

happy new market year 🥳
Hold my VALE calls? Up 30%

Depending on the loan type (FHA, traditional) you may be alright.  You can show the profit from the AMD sales so that may be sufficient.  This assumes you didn’t make some massive purchase of AMD at once (I.e., where did the $20k come from?), but if you bought slowly then it’s small dollar transactions that you can justify as simply using your allowance to buy stocks.

GL.  Don’t stress.  Just know you may have to jump through some hoops.
NOOOOOWWWWWW!!!!!!!!!!!!

1st week of 2021 Lets GO!!!
Its all downhill from here huh?
ICLN classically dumps at open then slowly climbs all day, then gaps up overnight and repeats. I'm in ICLN as well.
https://imgur.com/geZXIAg.jpg
lol what, it would have to rise more than 10x for ATH. If that happened I think I'd become a millionaire.
ICLN call holders, what we doing at open? Sell then buy the dip? Or are we on the up and up?
good ol nio

T is bae
"Citizens can't do anything" weird, I recall SW airlines tanking and losing 400 million dollars within a month after they aggressively removed that surgeon. Its almost as if you dumbasses got off your depressed asses and actually fought for whats right, our government wouldn't be in bed with China. Money stops talking when the citizens have had enough or did you miss the revolutionary period? Whats worse is they had far less capabilities to overcome the government than we do now. 

As for China, boycott and Boston tea party the companies in bed with slavery. I can't comprehend how people in America are vandalizing a statue so it can be pulled down due to slavery, but won't destroy apple for paying for 10 million Muslim slaves to build their phones. Can't do anything? Nah. You're just happier funding slavery for convenience and luxury rather than standing up for whats right as many have before.
I was told to buy B.N.G.O at .50, and again at 1.20

I didnt FML

Might FOMO today after a dip
It’s actually be 500 shares, but I don’t got that money right now, might just do 1 contract

How long before QS is the next NKLA
Why’s that
Inflation only matters on the stuff you spend the most. I don't really care if my small food budget goes up 5%. I do care if my rent goes up 5%.

All in NIO weeklies when it does its everyday open sell

Sell the news up to NIO day.

Now, whether thats sell today or in a few more days, IDK.  Probably gonna creep a tad higher.

I'm going to sell my NIO call 50C at open probably. They've been red for so long that I'll take the sell for profit. Nobody lost money selling green.
I just want a few acres around where I live now. We'll probably move away at some point but will want to come back eventually. A few hundred acres out west is a dream of mine. Maybe in Montana within a day's drive of Yellowstone. Might as well throw in a stream or river for fly fishing too while I'm fantasizing...
You should've seen the Weekend Thread
yes
Not stupid at all, lower tax on gains.
someone give me strength not to be a paper handed little pussy and diamond hands my apple 139s

Probably a drop to +.6% and then back up to our regularly scheduled moon mission

Sometime my pre-market show green to my portfolio and say "You will never get this, you will never get this la la la la"
Agree but perfectly time this is impossible. You’d be burning cash faster than this actually happens, and even if it does, you might end up just break even.
Lmfao
TSLA shareholders will wake up one day and see their wealth down 40% in one day like QS when the bubble pops.

I love my insurance broker. I started using him when I bought my house and he’s a deal hunter. I had better car insurance for like 3/4ths of what I was paying before. It’s all under an umbrella policy now but I definitely recommend using a broker.

I'm not American but how often you people use the credit system? 

In my country the banks already charge more than loan sharks so we almost never use the financial system to get credit, we own the money to buy things or we just don't buy.
I definitely agree with your last reply. I was simply addressing that there is a rather large cost connected with acquisition for PLTR meaning your "pure profit" claim was getting a little ahead of yourself. In a years time when they are a recurring customer, I would say you are right. Almost entirely profit!
BABA calls
this has been the longest weekend all year jeez

Hold TSLA through today or sell at open?
"My shitty stocks that I invest in keep dipping but why are the indexes that hold fundamentally good stocks keep going up?"
I hope. Not that I want Tesla to tank but because everyone loves a nice feel good story.
TSLA is too high IMO, lol
Lemme in. LEMME IN. Need to buy MARA calls.
You mean besides the fact it has no revenue or product or customers?
Thanks man, I’m just worried cause my timing seems to be incredibly off almost always.

It should have never been up so much. The company has zero revenues for the next 5 years. In 7-8 years it might make a profit. The tech might work. 

It could be the next Tesla, but it took Tesla 9 years to get going. I wanted to short the shit out of this stock when it was 125, but this should be all the way down to $10 to be honest
Yea but we have Liberty Prime. What do they got?
Thank you for your hard work, happy gambling !!

BA is historically caught in the geopolitical nonsense between US and China.  With China threatening retaliation, will not bode well for BA short term.

NIO already got 7.5m PM volume. Shits gonna get insane
I searched fidelity investments for the Nasdaq e-minis ones and they aren’t on there anywhere that I could find the other day could be part of why there is no market if some trading firms don’t have them.  I believe the S&P has been out for a while, as far as I’ve read they are just like the regular S&P options just way smaller like the SPY ETF.  What is great is they get better tax treatment then SPY ETF options as it’s partly considered long term gains instead of 100% short term like other options.

Stop supporting companies in bed with China, 90% of businesses in America are small mom and pops. Youre telling me you can't give up a little luxury and convenience to stop slavery over there? Does it only matter when it happened in America 200 years ago?

It's rough for sure. But having something you can dig a bunker in without some fucking landlord complaining is a plus. And... if you buy in an area with appreciating values, you'll end up with neutral mortgage in 5 years or so... we're up 250K on a home buy from 8 years ago... 

There's also the mortgage interest deduction which is a lot your first many years. The buying process sucks big time and you never know where the market will go, but it does have its benefits.

Good luck!

So everything was dropping for 3 days straight but all 3 indexes are up 3 days straight. How come?
Lol I just made that up - but it feels like at least 15 😩
This is the way
The house itself isn’t ... just think, you’re buying an asset that will likely appreciate (and presumably, worst case scenario, lose little value).

The nightmare is getting the loan.  Fucking loan officers, underwriters, and banks.  They will ask the stupidest questions while giving a rectal exam to your finances.  

And it’s always stupid shit, like “please explain why Amazon refunded you $57 in 2018?”
I'd sell and buy some longer dated calls with the profits
As mentioned before, you liberate China by not funding their dumbasses nor the companies in bed with them. We legit have a historical moment where we dumped millions of dollars of merchandise because we didn't like our governments behavior. Yet no one bats an eye to the slavery that produces  80% of products we use. Apparently slavery is only bad here in America lolol
wtf is cramer on this morning. he caught up on the cocaine he missed out on the past week.

Damn I haven’t traded since last year!
Luckily I got a foreclosure from the 2008 fallout. FWIW I would have said 2 years ago that the market was too crazy, and it just kept going up. Nobody knows.

Hello Merry people
Now back to your previously scheduled fade
Because u touch ur pp at night
New Year, Time to get that P&L off to a good start fellas
The PLTR norm is already being set up!

Minor green in pre-market that gets bled out by open, small pop on open, sharp drop, minor rebound, and then bleed for the last 5 hours!
If you can’t see the democrats and left wing are the only ones trying to get people cancelled, then you would probably be better off killing yourself and avoid all the trouble life is going to give you

Amazing
Real estate over time has never gone down. Just like the market. It took less than 10 years to recover from the biggest crash ever. As long as you take care of the place you will be fine. Poke your head in the attic and under the foundation once a year and remedy rot/water damage outside keep gutters clean and thats pretty much it.

Japan has a long history of illegal suspect 'interrogation' that closely boarders on torture. I think the criticism in itself is fair, difference being that in China, they use actual torture devices and aren't shy about it, either.

They found the hack before the feds. So they are arguably the best at what they do
My internet is down, how are my QS calls looking?
Does anyone remember a time in history where PLTR didn’t go down premarket?
Ya I like the idea of the ETFs and go long but I'm long on many many other things. This is just my weekly gamble. With that being said, I still think I'm going to pick APHA 8$ FDs at open

Match is still taxed when you take it out, so it's a nice bonus but nothing life changing.
Ah! That makes sense. Definitely RIP. Also obligatory you theta pedo!

And I would go the CC route if that much money was on the line.
My first order? Stop buying shit made from China. Second? Start to burn down companies directly affiliated with China and their slave labor. I really cannot comprehend why this is so impossible to see. America has done it before and can do it again. Hell even in ww1 and ww2 we nearly had coups on our government because of their shit behavior. Whats wrong with another Boston tea party against slavery? I thought Americans hated slavery?
Is anyone feeling DANGEROUS this morning and thinking of catching the QS falling knife? It might get caught right in your ass or maybe you time it and make enough to offset your PLTR L for the day? 🧐

 the inflation number is just a number, it does not necessarily reflect an individual consumers experiences. A lot depends on what goods and services are going up, by how much, and how much of those goods and services one partakes in.  


So yes, inflation will return (for some, it never went away). How bad it is, for each individual, will vary wildly.

This legit expanded my cultural awareness and deepened my understanding of the stock market's underlying mechanics. Invaluable resource, 420/69 would watch again.

It was a penny stock, but it’s over $5 premarket so I supposed it fair game now.

I doubt it. They'll counter with "we told you how risky this is, you knew what you were getting into", that kind of thing. 20k is nothing but if 10,000 autists YOLO 20k like that, they're done. I doubt they can afford to just not pursue debts.

7x QS @ 65, 1x SNOW @290, 1x BABA @ 235, 5x NET @ 77, 1x PLTR @ 25 although the last two should explore otm... That's about  140k if I take assignment

I think APHA would have the biggest speculative gains tbh, they have the capital to quickly move into new markets. Personally, I’d go actively managed ETFs though if and go long. Let the people who pick winners for a living pick your winners for you in a burgeoning industry.

That's the most unbelievable drop i've seen in a while.. holy cow. 130 to 60 in less than two weeks.. ho-lee-fuk.
Usual fading in PM, then red day
Reduce amount per day; set a time you can't smoke before each day (e.g. 4:20) and push that time later each day; make it a reward for doing something productive; never wake and bake; try mixing with or switching to CBD, use it only on weekends... I gradually added these things until stopping entirely a few months ago. Making much better trading decisions now so pretty damn happy about it. Used to feel stressed without weed, now I almost never even think about it

Not even gonna lie, I looked at the history of it on reddit and I think it legitimately originated out of r/conspiracy and the sentiment was basically:

>”why is no one mentioning this and why is this not on r/all ?”

The next 48 hours it exploded and was pretty much front page reddit within a short period of time after that. I dunno man. Seems sketch. Either Ma is hiding to evade the CCP or the CCP is “hiding” the fact that he’s missing.

But the way I see it, Ma is too much of a blow hard to not pull a Snowden and try to talk to people despite the CCP, but to be fair, he’s probably too dumb to be able to pull that off from a technicality standpoint. I think he may truly be *permanently* missing.

**They straight up Khashoggi’d his ass**

Edit: or, if he still is somehow alive, the mother fucker is driving this stock in the ground on purpose to poise an epic comeback and buy-back-in for himself.

Seriously.


At best, we'll be waist deep in zombie companies with basically zero economic growth. At worst...it can get a lot worse than that and not just economically, but socially. As government and banking/financialization further encroach on every aspect of life.
We're living in a clown world.. that's for sure.
They won't get anything through the senate through 2022 and the repubs are in a fantastic position to take the house in the midterms.  Weed is going to maintain status quo for a while.  Which isn't good for business.  Still a good long term investment if you have patience.

You could start a gofundme for that Wendy's lunch.
They don't "get" the money they work the entire fucking year for it, and it's 30k pre-tax so not even 20k after.  

If the intent of the stimulus is to stimulate the economy, this is a family that would actually spend the money locally at restaurants or buying goods, not immediately turning it over to Visa or their rich slumlord for back rent.

Alright guys, I know that this is asked ad nauseam, but is TSLA seriously a stonk that only goes up? Is it going to go up forever? 

I sold my shares at a profit but feel like I will always have FOMO as long as I don't own TSLA somehow. 

I know that nobody knows the answer to this, but are folks here betting on TSLA hitting $1k again this year? Are there folks out there shorting it today? Or is the smart play to just stay the fuck away from a stock whose behavior that makes no sense?

I was like..."haha, gotcha, bought PLTR at an average of 25! Not even touched NKLA or HTZ with a stick, i'm part of that crowd!" then i noticed the GME one...so fuck you!
Yes, they won’t have a product until 2025
Plus pay some large fine.

I have MT $30c for 1/15, is that gonna be too soon?
The couple making 180k gets 30k more you fucking idiot
PLTR is teasing all of you so harddd. Big boys gonna dump it today

Fire sale on PLTR
Ok im sold
They do on the days it happens but it’s hardly a headline Bc it’s covid and election season. Prob be some news ab it today with the anniversary of killing solemani or whatever his name is
[deleted]
Never did I recommend shortselling, you read it wrong. Those are the decisions people should make according to their personal strategy. What I said is that if you want to hedge against the market collapse - there are more cost efficient ways.
I miss some news on QS?
Imagine complaining about making 180k 😍😍 but seriously, what do you think is a better plan then?
> and everyone’s got nukes. 

So? they don't cancel out. You can't unnuke your city to fix it
When I lose my money gambling on the market for the 4th time, do you guys have any tips on brands of rope to buy? Preferably something that can hold like 240 lbs of retardation and not snap
Usually rips the first half hour before nosediving. Buy in then and ride it back up

This is the way

Same brother. Hang in there
At this point that should really be in ghost Jedi form.
Bro they make 180k stop fucking white knighting for them u simp
Your getting to worked up over grammar.
Have we seen Stefano Pessina in the last couple weeks?! Only explanation would be that the former Walgreen's CEO has gotten lost in the Rainforests of the DRC hunting for dinosaurs.

For those comparing PLTR new contract amount to current market cap:

Repeat after me, *”THE MARKET IS FORWARD LOOKING”*

So if your short, prepare to have your brown eye gapped by hypergrowth
The 180k couple can still buy 59 more PS5s than the other couple
Don't ask me man... Am about to be assigned 7 of these fucking turd options... Where the F am I going to find 45 odd k... Am a poor post Brexit limey

Grabbed some lotto ticket $72 Puts on friday
Working night shift on days like today is kinda stressful. Pretty much my busiest time at work is the last 30 mins of my shift which happens to be right at market open. Positions looking bigly green but this wouldn't be the first time this shit fades while I'm not looking.
My two cents: shares yes, calls not so sure
[removed]
Same bruh, I'm scared China is turning Jack Ma into an AAPL laborer. Puts on BABA, calls on AAPL.
Green ain’t that green. Do you know what it takes to produce the batteries and solar panels to go green?  It’s really just outsourcing environmental impact to...?  Ding ding ding! China.  “Go radioactive” should really be the cry of anyone who actually cares about the environment, but whatever.
You talking about Tesla, right?

Understand but your bored just like me. Tbh you are not real at all. Your just a fake Redditor saying fake things. I mean they can be studied and looked up
And you can pull stuff out your ass but you are not legit. Ima peace out tho.  This isn’t win or lose. Was interesting to chat. Stay safe and all. Just think what you say is fake. Not how you feel.
 Your validated. Don’t worry not gonna just dip and throw insults. Just wanted to let you know what I think of our convo. But also how I respect you and the things you do in life. Weather you are actually a therapist off of Reddit or you are not. Hope 2021 is good for you. And you can reply too I will read it.

STM let’s go !
Let it run a bit and then turn it into a spread.
I just don't see that happening. Democrats promise a lot of stuff that never happens. Just my opinion but they're in the pocket of all the same companies which leads me to believe that won't happen. I just really doubt they raise corporate taxes. But you may be right that people will fear that happening.
Vale up 4%, MT up 7% in early market. Steel back on the menu

Can’t argue with that logic cocksucka!
No but that first sale creates tentacles into the account and the bureaucratic process within the organization. Considering a lot of these are govt or quasi gov entities, that's a huge hurdle to jump. Solutions like these are extremely sticky by their nature. If you're a company, the more you get your processes in bed with the product, the harder and more expensive it will be to move. It's not as easy as dropping zoom for teams.
Today is my first day as well going cold turkey. Buy stonks that go up to inject dopamine, you’ll forget about being high right away

At some point, they’ll sell the debt to a company that specializes in tracking people down. Those people will hound you forever and your credit report will be terrible. Best bet is to suck it up and take out a personal loan to pay it off and move on. Declaring bankruptcy will cost more than 20k in the amount of extra interest you pay for having a shit credit score the next 30 years.
You'll need 40k and 32 frogs. Not toads. Frogs. Toads wont work. This is finance, not witchcraft.
Run, bike, lift, or build something. Make it past the first week and settle in to a routine.
if you place a call pre market that’s a little higher than the ask what’s the chance it gets filled at open ? slim to none? (given the stock is 🚀 premarket)
Were you not able to before?
got nothing against weed but i feel like a useless hobo 2 days after smoking up so i quit

Expansion into china opening a new store every 15 hours for the next couple years until around 6,000 new locations are established. Not including other store locations being added across the globe. They're improving their rewards program, once indoor seating is re-established that'll further drive demand up for coffee as well. Plus adding that coffee consumption is increasing as a global rate of 5.5% annually. 

Grabbing the call as well because IV is low and given between now and expiration date is plenty more room for upside in terms of price target increases, future investor days, partnerships, etc etc. Just something great to hold long term in the portfolio.

Wait what? Lol CNBC said the co1n crashed 15% earlier. Lol really? I need to see this.

Just remember there doesn't have to be this whole TSLA vs NIO bs. There can be more than one EV company that is successful. NIO will have great growth throughout the years but will never be like TSLA.

Slow down the nuclear arms race?  Hasn’t that race ended ages ago?  Didn’t stuxnet put an end to the last racer?  Terrorism is what this country was built on, and war on concepts don’t seem to do too well, for example drugs are winning the war on drugs.  World calories are sufficient to feed the world currently but distribution is the problem, so go talk to some war lords who like their people hungry and we are pretty well ready for the next big problem on the list.
\-2.4% for a "missing" CEO isn't even that bad imo.

Well there’s a huge difference between can’t and won’t, and everyone’s got nukes.
The "Jack Ma has gone missing" narrative is such lazy price manipulation but it'll work for a moment because it confirms all the beliefs and concerns of the most gullible people.

I don't know why people bought puts. The premium was absolutely insane. They'll just get theta crushed.
Is it too late to buy nio weeklies at 55/60 at open? Probably IV will be through the roof and it won't work
Sell em today there will be plenty of people willing to buy with the increased iv who don't even know what price it's being sold for.  Congrats

Someone else said 100+ by the end of 2023 just on fundamentals.

The shorts are fighting hard on this one. That is why everyone is saying buy shares and hold them in a cash account if you can.

We actually have helped them in their pursuits a lot. Just 39 years ago most of the nation was dealing with food insecurity. Now, with the influx of western cash they are well fed and have a booming(propped up by the country forcing the banks to give out bad loans) economy. Perhaps if they were still worried about getting every one fed, they would be less worried about watching what every one is doing. Remember Maslovs hierarchy of needs.

I don’t know. Those corrupt regimes tend to not be very open with anything they’re doing. But at the same time, I get the feeling that most rich people over there are rich because of some kind of corruption. And the regime accepts it as long as those rich people stay in line. When they start questioning the regime, the regime pushes back: “You’re going to question our corrupt ways? Well, let’s look at your crimes that we all know you did, but we agreed not to peruse because... well, we both stay off our corrupt ways. But if you’re going to play that card, let’s go to court and you go to prison”. Kind of like the Russian oligarchs who are all criminals, but as long as they stay out of politics, the government leaves them alone.

Wait for the pullback, futures don’t mean as much with less traded stocks. My guess is it will open high, pull back, rebound.
Remember stocks do only go up
I’m only in calls but why do y’all gotta downvote bears whenever they mention their puts. Those guys have been through enough
Tip is to look at your counties public housing records and cold calling people who may not have their house for sale on MLS or publicly. It’s the equivalent of going door to door in a neighborhood with a card offering to buy someone’s house (this method works as well). Many of the best deals in real estate never come on the market.
Is it too late to load up a quick Nio call today?
Nope, from my background. It is applicable to you.

Jack isn't the CEO. Does he have anything to do with the company anymore?
That may have been the reason then. The reason now is the price is too expensive because it was run up too quickly. They want to buy because it’s proven there is interest now despite the fundamentals. They just want the prices that earlier funds got in at which was under $10. 

This thing drops back to the low teens they will buy. I say get it over with so they can get theirs. It’s not going anywhere until then unless retail stops being chicken shit.

Is there any options to place calls on Jack Ma’s organs, incase he slips and falls in this prison.. er re-education facility ?
XLY's option chain is really bad. I wanted to "blend" some AMZN stability into my Tesla play for next month but the volume and open interest on the non-first-monthly is almost non-existent. Not sure for XLC but then again if they have the Greeks you want, more power to you. Don't forget XLC is like 50/50 big tech and big debt boomer dividends so it's more sensitive to bonds than the debt-free low div XLK

Why would you buy shares of a company like QS if you can’t even hold through one big dip, QS is a long term play when I bought shares it was with the understanding I was going to hold the stock at least 5 years and I’m prepared for huge dips, the stock was up 30% in one day of course it could dip back. People who can’t hold shares are the ones who lose the most money..

That's fiscal stimulus. Congress would have to do this, or pass a law allowing the Fed to do it. Half the country would "reeeeeeeee SOCIALISM!@#$" so it's not happening in our lifetimes. Instead the Fed has to bend over backwards in their interpretation of the law and pump asset prices with QE, hoping some of it trickles down. 

Fed is also dumb and in denial about it.

This isnt advice but I would suspect that if you just deleted the app and closed your account then there's a decent chance they wouldn't pursue you legally beyond a few threatening emails because it would be an absolute disaster from a PR standpoint, especially since RH is under quite a bit of scrutiny at the moment.

A few "I opened a RH account and deposited $5k thinking that was all I could lose and now they are sueing me for $20k and I'm going to lose my house" stories in the media and they are going to be losing a lot of customers.

Still quite risky but better than bankruptcy
NIFUCKINGOOOOOOOOOOO BABY!
How does it make sense to have a <1000 P/E ratio
Once we find out the Chinese gov't officially off'd Jack Ma I'll have to sell some deep out of the money calls to to limit the losses.
it flips basically every fucking time so…

HUNGRY FOR AAPL?
Do you retards really think Jack Ma is dead? We have seen this shit before, he will emerge in a few months like nothing happened
Excited to spend all morning reading about solid investments ( MSFT, SQ, NET), but then impulsively yolo meme options when the market opens (CRSR, SPCE). Tell myself something like "I'll use the profits from this to buy those other stocks!!!"   


Can't fail guyz right?
I’m so sick of people saying an R senate with Biden in office would be better. They literally won’t let any stimmy pass, how stupid do you have to be to not know that
> Sell your GME and buy VALE & MT while you still can.

The fact that this is being said and left unchecked makes me worried that I should sell GME.
where is my Ma
Mods, I’m all in on ICLN. Can I get some gang green flair?
All luck no skill
He technically isn't missing, just hasn't made a public appearance
this very much. the software is one a kind and most importantly *built* 

let the money roll in
Now try to sell it ha
So BABA that was considered undervalued and had a BUY rating from all anal-ysts is in a free fall. PLTR that is considered overvalued and the same afflicted individuals insisted on selling is now surging.
Why workhorse taking off this morning
I love to sell PLTR puts as well!  Print money around $18.  Good call!
Well yea they aren’t going to tweet negative things. I bought shares at 10 and I’m in it for the long haul but expect it to be silent for at least a year.

That’s what I’m saying. It would be great if it happened, but Elon will probably prefer to do a direct listing instead of some SPAC reverse merger

Trade of the year: dumping 5 figures worth of BABA calls on 12/22 at a 30% loss. That’s the best outcome you can hope for with that trash. Good luck bag holders don’t forget the lube.

Personally I’m holding. But if you want to play safe, sell half at EOD
For what it's worth Burry's thesis is that if there's ever flight from ETFs there's nowhere near enough liquidity in the market to absorb the supply being dumped indiscriminately. Good companies get dumped along with bad and everything comes crashing down. I feel like funds focused on small caps are even more susceptible to this.
All in on 2150P and 2100P expiring this week. Yes I’m retarded, but this stock has massive swings each day. But today, I might be fucked.
Agreed. And if GILF Cathie don’t want it, I don’t want it.

Heard that Jack Ma's doing an unpaid internship at Xinjiang (gulag of china) now.
Where you go? I miss you so , feels like it’s been forever
My guess on this situation is that RH doesn’t trade after hours and their leveraged stock/options dropped to negative before RH could pull a margin call. Margin calls stop you from going into debt to RH.
He has to disclose his calls
Thats one expensive ass put position
I tried to say that many places outside of china are reliant on baba and if baba is faltering, then those business will be impacted, if this incident cuts that deep into the supply chain. It is definitely skimming it.
It barely did anything on the most recent contract before this too lol
Damn that sounds pleasant
I did the same with CAN. Up 22% premarket

Parents: IF you’ve got $60k why are you living in our basement rent free and not chipping in on meals?
Some brokers pool investors money so the broker buys, idk, 50,000 shares, then divides them up between investors. But obviously favour their investors throwing in 7-figures over people like me.

The media is controlled by the same corporations that control the government.

We are literally divided on purpose. Since the dawn of time the people that have have oppressed those that have not. Nothing has changed, the haves have simply gotten better at disguising it as freedom.
And you are enjoying it aren't you?
Sell your GME and buy VALE & MT while you still can.
You're so fucking edgy bro
I know I should want to make money, but honestly I'm a bit exhausted from the endless upward green. It seems so detached
Don’t worry I’m a doctor and I’ve seen this before. What you wanna do is buy some PLTR calls at open
Cause this shit is about to drill to the center of the earth and I’m not gonna sell calls for the next 5 years bag holding 🤦🏻‍♂️
Lol pltr crashing with a new contract in a new market and country. At this point it feels like nothing is going to save this stock.

Don’t get me wrong... theres flaws in Star Trek. Like, who wants to be a high school custodian ‘for the good of the planet’. However, in the story line, humans would have gotten there on their own. They made warp after ww3. The Vulcans just helped them advance faster.
Okay. Thanks.

Strange as demand for the stocks and warrants are both independently high. But I guess people tend to fall in one camp or the other.
First day back to work and I can already confirm this is gay as fuck

Because it's "Explain like I 5", right?
I think it’s funny the banks would even allocate one share instead of just doing 100 minimum

Except the Fed isn't elected so they can just stick their fingers in their ears, shout "OUR POLICIES DON'T CONTRIBUTE TO WEALTH INEQUALITY LALALALA" over and over again and there's nothing we can do about it.

Oh and our taxes don't pay for it. Fed money is created out of thin air. We pay for it in inflation and all the other social ills that come with massive wealth inequality.

If you believe in Cathie Wood, you're buying that BABA dip this morning.  I'm betting she's adding more.
Start the fucking count already!!! These NIO calls arent gonna buy themselves
Got one weekly just before close on Thursday for a little earnings play. Should I buy march/April calls today?
Does robinhood not allow you to sell premarket or something?
Listen here you retards, Xi is giving you another chance to load up on BABA before it takes off for the moon after Jack mysteriously vanishes forever. Buy the fking dip...
BABA? This is the only dip I can find this morning.
Close it out. Don't exercise.  Gain that time value.

Honestly if we were talking about Imperialism era I’d feel pretty confident in your statement as well. But given how good these little slimes are at computers I doubt physical strength or weaponry would be useless after major hacking attacks on banks, power supplies, distribution etc

Fun fact since i started blocking people who use the words dont sleep, sleeping on, asleep my profit has increased almost 170%.
You can't just say bankruptcy and expect anything to happen
Correct
Why does a unit (stock + 1/3 warrant) cost significantly less than the price of seperately buying stock + 1/3 price of warrant?
Pltr let's go!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Unemployment was still way below the Fed's mandated level. Assuming her priors were true - that QE is the best way for the Fed to help the economy - unwinding the balance sheet would have been counterproductive at the time.
Can’t wait to watch premarket slowly fade, and everything sell off at open because I got too horny that my YOLO was green premarket

Weed calls? which ones?
it's coming back down now. i wonder if it'll increase when the mkt actually opens. not sure when's a good time to come in.
Sell and buy OTM calls!
Cintron, Credit suisse, Morgan Stanley has them.
MMs, please take PLTR to 30. Everyone knows it is a fair price.

Just say that you recalculated!!!
I watch a lot of peter thiel videos so I guess the google algorithm knows to show me news about anything Thiel related haha. I listened to the q3 earnings call and started buying that next day, averaging in unfortunately shoulda just loaded the truck cause I had high conviction with it
I had COVID back in beginning of November and taste/smell still hasn’t fully recovered. I’d say it’s about 75% back. Anyone else have a prolonged taste and smell recovery? I’ll be seriously depressed if I can’t fully taste my vanilla ice cream ever again.
That doesn't make it any better, though the Japanese conviction rate has different origins, such as case selection by prosecutors dropping all cases that seem less likely to end in a conviction and compared to other developed nations rather limited rights for suspects being questioned, causing a high rate of (potentially questionable) confessions. Also a weak judiciary, compared to the prosecution.
Cheers to another day of shorting DASH into the fucking dirt 🍻

BA being a big piece of shit as usual.
Everyone sleeping on FLIR, buy out happening, will get close to double.
Problem for Yellen is unemployment was still way higher than the Fed's mandate. JPow is the only one to get the opportunity. And he failed both times because the bond market is clearly broken without Fed intervention. The options are to let it all collapse, or keep kicking the can down the road. The only one that has a hope of matching the Fed's price stability mandate is the latter.
For real fuck PENN

 Bring us two Absolut Martinis               

  straight up. Precisely seven and                

 a half minutes after you deliver              

   those you'll bring two more, then              

   two more every five minutes until              

   one of us passes out.
Im buying QS and PLTR dips. Hope this shit drops HEAVY at open so i can load up.
math checks out
I'll home brew some gasoline as well.

Yeah I thought of that too, but like I said, until that is ubiquitous and rapid transit is, real estate is the way to go. You’re not going to see a massive crash in demand overnight in real estate, and city centers will still remain “centers” for a while until then.

🤷you'd have to crunch the numbers in your area to see if it is worth it still. Also would be smart to tack on extra money for inevitable repairs and time spent dealing with such things. Living in apartments can also offer amenities you'd never be able to afford at a house (front desk services/door service).  I'm not saying buying a house is dumb. I'm just saying you have to assess your individual situation. Some people prefer letting home-owning be someone else's headache. Personally I prefer the option to move around freely and will likely never buy.

I know it's not sexy but Renault might be a decent punt. Renault's ZOE is selling really well in Europe and is small form factor car cheaper than nissan leaf and id3 and also a bit smaller in size.

Why? The Japanese spent most of written history kicking the shit out of them. 

I would never actually advocate for war, but I don’t think China would do very well if the world actually wanted to crack down on them. The reason they don’t is more commercial - everything is made there.
It was dirty before they did that
The CCP already eliminated his old comp and are known to take out any nuisances.  Alibaba is not longer without Jack Ma, his damn book was basically a warning to people to not do business with the CCP if you could read between the lines.
Once Jack's "re-education" is voluntarily completed, by choice, he will return to bring BABA to new heights in the name of GREAT COMMUNIST CHINESE GOVERNMENT OF GREATNESS AND NOT VIRUSES!

Yeah, thinking of doing that. Most of my money is in leaps, so I am kinda immune against a drop. But, I would rather secure some profit now and buy back if there is a dip later.
PLTR like the boring female classmates we had and never noticed, now they became the hottest milfs in town.
Same shit somehow. When I wake up I'm mooning and then the more I check it, the more shit fades on me wtf
What about the one Ren Zhiqiang? Billionaire who called out the CCP and after people started asking where he was they told the world he "voluntarily" came forward with all of his crimes of corruption. Sentenced to 18 yrs. Oh and China has a 99% conviction rate.

Also, when I mentioned the conviction rate just think of this. How many of us are in jail for calling the POTUS a clown or "orange man".

CCP freakin jailed a guy for "protesting" for walking around with a sign that had a smiley face.
Sir - it's called geared to income housing and when you have none its a sweet deal.

I don’t want to be a loser and buy UVXY calls but damn they look tasty
More good news for $PLTR  
Probably means the stock will tank today too as usual.
Reminds me of a speech by a famos soccer player, Erik Cantona:


“As flies to wanton boys are we to the gods, they kill us for their sport. Soon the science will not only be able to slow down the ageing of the cells, soon the science will fix the cells to the state and so we will become eternal.
“Only accidents, crimes, wars, will still kill us but unfortunately, crimes, wars, will multiply. I love football. Thank you.”

I'm getting worried about Ma. Do you think there's sum ting wong?
Its China, what do you expect -_-

Youre talking about the country that kills you if you slander the "glorious leader", ran over its citizens with tanks, welded people into their homes when corona started, kidnaps and "reeducates" people who think wrong, and over the past year has been publicly shown to have muslim concentration camps, literally pulling a Hitler 2.0...
Unless you plan on day trading today or tomorrow I would go cash until the election is decided. Odds are the GOP holds control but obviously that is not a guarantee until after the election. Cash gang until Wednesday. Either way Wednesday

&#x200B;

EDIT: and by "election" I am referring the senate runoff
But grammatically it’s always plural. You would always say “they are” never “they is”. Same thing with ‘you’.

I don't think its politicians that are the problem, its that people don't care about human rights violations on the other side of the planet if they benefit from it.
A perfect call
Actually useful info, thanks man
Things you can't unsee...
There's a guy at work that is expecting the stimulus but I'm pretty sure he makes too much to qualify. I don't have the heart to tell him.
I'm up on it. But at some point you have to protect the profits you have. I'll probably will get back in after march. You can even see my post history and see PLTR has treated me well.
Yooo we need Georgia to not screw this rally up.

Don’t be a stupid bitch, if you’ve got shares just hold them. You already paid for them, just wait and see where it goes. 

5 shares @ $15 (pre WSB glorification) 10 @ $27 (post $33 dip) and considering 200 more shares at $20.
I dropped a few hundred in before the run and only wish I had done more. Just leaving it in there. At some point this thing will crash down hard so not dropping anymore in

So up 1% premarket and then down 4% for the day
So you’d rather take the loss rather than just leave this in your portfolio to grow at several times over next few years?

Maybe this type of thing isn’t for you. Guaranteed it comes back to at least your initial price over next 12 months. 

Just have patience.

What legislation?
China IS CANCER


This is another step in China's never-ending campaign to annihilate human rights:

* Hundreds of human rights lawyers (not even dissidents, just the LAWYERS who defended people) were snatched by gestapo all over China in what is known as the [709 Crackdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/709_crackdown).

* One of those lawyers, Wang Quanzhang was [sentenced to 4.5 years](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/28/wang-quanzhang-china-sentences-human-rights-lawyer-to-four-years-in-prison) for "subversion of state power". But that's not enough. China actually [went after Wang's 6-year-old son](https://chinachange.org/2019/09/06/imprisoned-lawyer-wang-quanzhangs-six-year-old-son-once-again-forced-out-of-school/), forcing him out of his school and banning any other school from taking him in.

* A dissident, [Wang Bingzhang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Bingzhang_(dissident\)) was kidnapped by Chinese agents in Vietnam and sentenced to life in prison after a closed trial that lasted 1 day.

* A man wore a t-shirt with the word "Xitler" on it and [was disappeared](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2016/11/03/young-chinese-activist-missing-after-sharing-plan-to-wear-xitler-t-shirt-on-cpc-anniversary-report/). Eventually he was [tried for "subversion of state power" while barred from meeting with lawyers](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2017/02/15/chinese-xitler-activist-trial-subversion-lawyers-barred-seeing/)

* Another man, [Wang Meiyu](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/sep/27/death-of-chinese-activist-in-police-custody-prompts-calls-for-investigation-into-torture) hold up a placard calling for Xi’s resignation & democracy. He was arrested for "picking quarrels”. He ended up dead in custody.

* A woman live streamed herself [splashing ink on a Xi poster](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V9sF34fJwh0). She was [disappeared](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-woman-dong-yaoqiong-disappears-spraying-ink-xi-jinping-a8455166.html). Her last social media update: *"Right now there are a group of people wearing uniforms outside my door. I’ll go out after I change my clothes. I did not commit a crime. The people and groups that hurt me are the ones who are guilty"*. Later on there was report of her being [sent to a psychiatric hospital](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/07/23/chinese-protester-splashed-ink-xi-jinping-poster-sent-psychiatric-hospital-report/)

* After the ink-splash woman's disappearance her father made a series of broadcast to call attention to her plight. He ended up getting [taken away by the police in the middle of a live stream](https://www.hongkongfp.com/2018/07/14/police-interrupt-youtube-live-stream-father-missing-chinese-woman-splashed-ink-xi-jinping-photo/)

* 5 people associated with a Hong Kong bookstore that sold titles such as "*Xi Jinping and His Six Women*" were [disappeared](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causeway_Bay_Books_disappearances). Only one managed to escape back to HK. He held a press briefing to tell the world about his kidnapping by China. He's now in exile in Taiwan. The other 4 are still somewhere in China.

And, of course

* [1.5 million](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-xinjiang-rights/15-million-muslims-could-be-detained-in-chinas-xinjiang-academic-idUSKCN1QU2MQ) Uyghurs rounded up in concentration camps

* Genocide through [forced abortions](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-women-abortions-sexual-abuse-genocide-a9144721.html) on Uyghur women

* [Sexual torture](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-uighur-muslim-women-abortions-sexual-abuse-genocide-a9144721.html) of Uyghur women such as rape & rubbing intimate parts with chili paste.

* [Leaked footage](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/d722aw/chinas_detention_of_uighurs_video_of_blindfolded/) of a large number of blindfolded Uyghurs shackled together

* A Canadian journalist [wanted to debunk reports of Chinese anti-Muslim repression so he went on a stage-managed show tour put on by China](https://nationalpost.com/news/canadian-went-to-china-to-debunk-reports-of-anti-muslim-repression-but-was-shocked-by-treatment-of-uyghurs). That means he only saw a fake Potemkin village that China actually thought was acceptable by Western standard. But the brutality of even this fake Potemkin village stunned him. Now imagine what's really happening in the real concentration camps where millions of Uyghurs are being held. Imagine how bad the true situation is.

* Using minorities & political prisoners as [free organ farms](https://www.reddit.com/r/worldnews/comments/c1my5j/china_is_harvesting_organs_from_detainees_uk/). A doctor's [eye witness account](https://nypost.com/2019/06/01/chinese-dissidents-are-being-executed-for-their-organs-former-hospital-worker-says/): *'The prisoner was brought in, tied hand and foot, but very much alive. The army doctor in charge sliced him open from chest to belly button and exposed his two kidneys. Then the doctor ordered Zheng to remove the man’s eyeballs. Hearing that, the dying prisoner gave him a look of sheer terror, and Zheng froze. “I can’t do it,” he told the doctor, who then quickly scooped out the man’s eyeballs himself.'*

* Call for [retraction of 400 Chinese scientific papers](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/feb/06/call-for-retraction-of-400-scientific-papers-amid-fears-organs-came-from-chinese-prisoners) amid fears organs came from Chinese prisoners

* [15 Chinese studies retracted](https://www.newscientist.com/article/15-15-studies-retracted-due-to-fears-they-used-chinese-prisoners-organs/) due to fears they used Chinese prisoners' organs

* [Cultural genocide (and organ harvests, of course)](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/china-uyghur-muslim-rules-laws-treatment-chinese-human-rights-religion-a8534161.html). A uyghur's testimony: *"First, children were stopped from learning about the Quran, then from going to mosques. It was followed by bans on ramadan, growing beards, giving Islamic names to your baby, etc. Then our language was attacked – we didn’t get jobs if we didn’t know Mandarin. Our passports were collected, we were told to spy on each other, innocent Uyghur prisoners were killed for organ harvesting"*

* China is moving beyond Uyghur and cracking down on its model minority Hui Muslim. ['Afraid We Will Become The Next Xinjiang': China's Hui Muslims Face Crackdown](https://www.npr.org/2019/09/26/763356996/afraid-we-will-become-the-next-xinjiang-chinas-hui-muslims-face-crackdown): *"The same restrictions that preceded the Xinjiang crackdown on Uighur Muslims are now appearing in Hui-dominated regions. Hui mosques have been forcibly renovated or shuttered, schools demolished, and religious community leaders imprisoned. Hui who have traveled internationally are increasingly detained or sent to reeducation facilities in Xinjiang."*

All you TPP fanboys keep conveniently forgetting that the public was told fuck all about details. We literally didn’t know what it was actually going to do, so all we had to go on was rumor. And the rumors were wild, talking about how all jobs would be outsourced immediately and the corporations would rule everything. So of course the general public was all “fuck that”. And whoever was in charge of communicating for the TPP accomplished diddly shit in terms of educating the public. Hell even slobberingly left friendly Reddit was generally a hard “no” on the TPP. Y’all just forget about that and want to say “orange man bad”.
Thanks bro

Buying SPY Puts at open
Aren’t we all brudda?
People who discount the value of Palantir's small contracts forget that it's recurring revenue & that they're adding small contracts pretty much weekly. The fact that they can scale up or down so that they're not relying on just a few huge customers is really appealing to me.

 ~$1B in revenue expected for 2020, even ten small $30M contracts in 2021 and they're up big on revenue YOY. Bullish on PLTR
Perdue out of campaign trail definitely doesn’t help. And Loeffler has never actually won an election

Sorry for your loss, fellow retard.
2 sentence DD... Go!
This is the way.
You have a harem?
“Absolutely YOLO $200”

You don’t know the meaning of at least 2 of those 3 words. 

You pick.
Bold of you to call Tesla a Level 5 autonomy that's not there yet when as of right now it barely classifies as a full Level 3. That's like calling a RH trader with a 10k portfolio a millionaire that's not there yet. Every stage of autonomy is exponentially more difficult than the last so i think it is extremely unlikely Tesla will achieve anything close to high Level 4 or Level 5 anytime soon (in the sense that they will assume any kind of liability and don't demand the driver to be fully attentive at all times), based on the already relative snail pace they've been going. If you think about it they started out at a low Level 3 and are just now a high Level 3 (if we're being generous), after like 5 years of promises. I think Musk greatly underestimated how difficult it would be, considering he was promising something along the lines of Level 4 for 2018. Or he knew how difficult it would be and just lied, that's also a possibility that for some reason always gets discarded, i honestly can't imagine everybody he hired was so inexperienced that they seriously told him they could do it in 2 years.

I'm not sure on pricing as I've not gone on there in some time. Don't just use TOR. Look into Tails OS. It fits on a 4gb thumbdrive and comes prepackaged with Tor, PGP Encryption, etc.


Unplug all of your regular hard drives and plug in said USB. Then, flash the BIOS and select Tails as the operating system that you want to boot up.

>	Also IMO limiting our consumption option would be a great thing. The amount of shit we produce that is made to be enjoyed a couple of days then thrown away sickens me. Pure and simple waste of resources.

Although you are right about a lot of resources being wasted, limiting consumption options would be a pretty bad option imo. Overall welfare would reduce, and especially people with a relatively lower income would be hit by this.

Investing a lot in green and sustainable energy  should be the priority right now. The sad thing is that a lot of people are very much against saving the world for some weird reason, so it won’t happen as much as it should.

I'm really looking forward to the RH IPO. I hope it's later in the year, I want tendies from MT first.

Personally once you have a decent position of etfs, roths are perfect for the wheel theta strategy because of no post taxes. I would recommend running one or more on a stock your bullish on. You'll generate a lot of money to use on buying more etfs or the underlying stock

>It would maybe double cost of consumer goods, which if you are poor you couldn't buy and it would couse big jump in inflation and big distrust in American gov.

Well there was a plan that would have stopped it involving a trans-Pacific trade deal which included many countries that wanted to check China in a multilateral partnership. Forgot what they called it...I do remember that a certain buffoon and his lackeys killed it though.

And before you come out and say Hillary Clinton said she opposed a month before the election, please don't waste my time in a bad faith argument. Everyone on Reddit and their mother knew she was lying when she said that. It was so obvious. She negotiated large portions of it before she left the SoS job for christsakes. It was a stupid flip flop because Trump and Bernie convinced a bunch of rubes economics wasn't real. Trump went further and convinced the rubes that if he we just talk a real big anti-China game and take actions that sounds strong that's even better than having good policies that could actually combat China. Now China is stronger than ever while we have our dick in our hands while we embarrass ourselves and can't get intelligent policies through to restrain China. It's a joke.

Buy low, buy low, keep buying low, when you have 1000-5000 shares, start selling 5-10x covered calls with 5-10% OTM and get rich. This method is developed in colaboration with the new palantir gotham extension "Getting tendies analytics".

They want WW3 I guess. These people always seem to think we can somehow beat China in a war. Even if we can the fucking planet would turn to dust ball from the instant use of  already scare resources both sides would use. We need to get mad at our politicians and the corporations that lobbied them into writing trade deal that would made it more favorable to move large parts of manufacturing out the country and into China and other countries.

Look at the o c g n chart all time. It’s horrendous. Then compare it to an all time chart of a legit company. Then look at the last week. The pump already happened. Anyone buying now is paying for the sellers wife’s new tits and they get stuck holding the bull. Guarantee that thing will be back to .50 where it was in no time.

Stay safe out there friend.
MT up 7% premarket. Let’s go baby! I’ll remain cautiously optimistic that it won’t dump to 1% green by open and finish red like the last two weeks.

Happened to me last month and I literally posted "puts on my balls" in the daily thread too. 
Getting nice comments from all the sweet autists actually made me feel better.


It didn't hurt, but it's like I was constantly aware of my left testi. Urologist checked it and said it was nothing to worry about, and now 3 weeks later it is gone and I am back to normal.


I did, however, went insane and kept postponing seeing a doc. We're guys, weird shit around our junk can make us nervous.


Set up an appointment, and I'm positive you'll end up finding out it's nothing. Calls on your gooch.
It's not bad, but its teribble. It would maybe double cost of consumer goods, which if you are poor you couldn't buy and it would couse big jump in inflation and big distrust in American gov. and it would maybe happen that our tax money still would need to subsidise that same factories so they would not raise prices more becouse profit is a profit, you are in trade deficit with your store where you buy bread, why then you dont go and fix that issue or maybe make your own bread from localy grown wheat or rye.
Did you take the last donut?

Government bonds actually costs money to own here in Europe due to the negative interest rates a lot of countries have.

But 7% on index funds is still a good choice, for those who aren’t autistic :p
They're totally death camps. Also Saddam had WMDs and Gaddafi was giving his troops Viagra to rape people. 
No, but seriously, it's largely distorted by the State Dept and Nt'l Endowment for Democracy funded NGOs as a pretext for war with China on "humanitarian" interventionist grounds. It's hilarious how an Islamophobe like Ted Cruz is suddenly so vocal about the plight of Turkic Muslims in China.

Wish I had just dumped my whole portfolio into Bingo back when it was a dollar instead of putting my last $10 in.
Yah that’s part of it. They are just a suckers bet and you’re better off sticking to things in the $20+ range. 

 You’re buying those stocks from someone and the ones selling it to you are the ones winning. They have no stop sell orders since most brokers don’t do stop orders under $5 so your risk is insane. When they do drop the chances of it coming back to break even are crazy low. 

If it’s a .50c stock and it falls to .25c - if you didn’t get out you now need that stock to make a 100% move. How often does that happen?

They are ripe for pump and dumps. They also will dump on you in minutes since there is no buyer support like you see in more established stocks and if your over leveraged panic will set in and you’ll eat a big loss. 

Just say no to penny stocks and anyone who tells you otherwise is an idiot and probably had 1 good trade or is trying to get you to pump it.

👁👄👁

Idk, it just makes sense that institutional buyers want to supress the price and push it as deep as possible before buying in. Lock-up expiry will definitely send it down, so it makes sense to keep it down until then. And imo, it's easier/cheaper to keep the price down for 2 months than it is to let it moon, and tjen trying to push it down

You need a sound business generating value, something of worth other than sweaty neckbeards gathering in a local mini mart, to instill consumer confidence and growth.

GME is a dying brand, the latest in a long line of dying brands like Sears, Kmart or Circuit City.

Going to be a red day for BABA

So you’re saying theirs a chance
im quite flattered by you taking time to copy and paste the definition of quite a difficult word that you have come across several times in the recent uighur topic, ill give you a pat on the back for effort. Thats all you really can do though, copy and paste.

 if you look very carefully and open your slanty eyes you might actually find the key word at the beginning of your definition of genocide where killing needs to happen genocide to be coined that. no body count, no declining population, fake reports from the same two sources that are badly translated at best. if you quote daily mail then lol Ill just stop replying

 I personally believe the multiple UN reports and believe the greatness of US intelligence to speak up about it if there were any real genocide to be found ongoing, but no massive graves, astronomical numbers of deaths really do point otherwise. Its unfortunate that the term concentration camp is used because it has connotations back to ww2, but it really is just pointing to that it is just a reeducation centre to repurpose and mobilise an at risk population to religious conversion.

but thats ok, war is not genocide because civilians cant be categorised into purposeful killing right.

edit: do remember to acknowledge why china has thousands of other muslim and uighur ethic minorities that arent actively being genocided by the way. this seems to be another point that many conveniently ignore
YEAH !!

FIST ON CHEST NO FEAR 😏🚀🚀🚀🦈🦈
If we signed the TPP and negotiated with allies to fight China with us we would actually put a dent in them. Plus it is not worth the effort to relocate the already lost jobs back here. That would only increase consumer costs.

One of the  oldest tricks in the book,  "short and distort". While the seasoned investors and traders get used to these mockeries of valuations and mostly ignore or make a profit off the same , I  feel sorry for people who have invested their hard earned money into companies they trust based on researched opinions, facts  and suddenly see their account balance fluctuating owing to foolish biased statements from "analysts".

Max profit was \~2250 with max loss of \~6000. I say approximately because I re-positioned a few times over a couple weeks (at a profit fortunately). Also, I was afraid of a run-up this week so I actually got a couple call spreads 750-770 last week that protect me against $4000 in losses in case of a big run-up. Max loss on those spreads is $500 since I got a good spread on the entry. Soooo basically its complicated but looking good for me so far haha

Here's the consensus I'm seeing on all the serious DD:

Long term (2+ years): bearish for all your reasons and more. We still have no idea how the PC thing is going to work, or why Microsoft felt obligated to fork over a percentage of all digital purchases to GME, so there is hope for the future, but it won't be enough to change bearish sentiment until we have more details (hopefully at ICR).

Short term: highly dependent on a Cohen takeover. The current board's mindset is "How do we delay our inevitable death?" Cohen's mindset is "How do we avoid death altogether?"

Very short term: all signs irrefutably point to a squeeze. A Cohen takeover and/or great news about the company's shifting direction will make the squeeze push even higher with bullish hype, but the squeeze is happening even if we get bearish news. *Edit*: This is thanks to all the shorts betting on immediate bankruptcy, which means even a 1-year death will kill the shorts.
Fuck this, fuck you, I brought at $25 and PLTR is going to the fucking moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Hindsight is 20/20. This pullback is healthy to go to 100 k, it can’t go straight up
As I said- it seems to be regional- west cost loves weedmaps, east coast loves Leafly.  I can speak for both consumer and back end support, Leafly wins in my book. Weedmaps is trying to improve, but I just see them doing the same stuff Leafly has already implemented. In a grander scheme, this is more like apple versus android- both will thrive but some people have their preferences

No one cares about the Amsterdam exchange. It's premarket in the US. And no shit, but again, we can be posting every time a <50 dollar stock is up 95 cents. This is a joke.
Xetra right now 590 Eur \~ 725 USD, so more like 2% up on last close in the US. But America Paper Hands and Gay Bears will sell that off in about three minutes after open, because Good News = Stocks Down for Tesla.
Lockdowns are good for the market.

A lot of the news is prob already priced in. Will still get a nice day i think, and it will keep going throughout the week. I'm thinking green all week but not a massive +10% day.

yeah, i do think we will see an increase but it's not going to be instant. Our biggest catalyst will be earnings which will absolutely OBLITERATE projections. Until earnings I expect this to get to 26 until then. Earnings will push it probably to 30 and run up past 30 afterwards. All speculation though
Yea I'm gonna stick to +-3% volatility thanks
CRSR. Thought it was a gambling company before I bought it and I couldn’t even remember the ticker correctly but it seems like it’s going well.

it's up 2.9% in the US pre market.
Twitter is going to shit itself when all the soccer moms wake up who invested at $30k+
I dunno bout that arkg unless it’s like $100 and a month+ out. It blasted down that $100 level which should have technically held and then after that 2nd to last inside day (inside days are buyers meeting sellers and a pivot will likely follow) so followed by another big sell I’d give that bad boy some more time. That 100 is major resistance and historicaly 100 is a major psychological resistance for all stocks to break.

Also, it’s been trading in like a $7 avg range so when it does pop through $100 again it miiiight hit 107/110 so unless you’re gonna play it 1+month out near the money you’re gonna want to scalp it and not be greedy.

I don’t know how to quantify the increased leverage since it really depends on the future and the option you buy. But there is an increased amount of leverage when compared to both equity options and normal futures.
 just some bored weekenders playing since the markets were closed cashing out. Just more proof the market is speculative.

People who make $20+ will feel invalidated, cause now they hardly make more than minimum wage. Not a good reason but it’s true
Wages are only a small component of most goods. So you can double minimum wage and maybe it adds 5% to the cost.

We have retail workers getting paid $26 an hour here in Australia and we're a much more functional country than the US. Free healthcare, strong welfare system, not much crime.

7.25 federal minimum wage

40x7.25 = 290

290x4 = 1160 per month before taxes. That's not a livable wage even in the cheapest parts of america.
ICLN is the closest thing to free money there is. Gubmint backing it for geopolitical (less reliance on foreign oil), environment, politicals (climate change freaks) reasons. literally no chance it doesnt grow exponentially during a Biden administration.

I’m thinking similarly. Bounce at ~17.30 max in next few days & runnup to mid Jan sales numbers, sell off news and one last, a Melvin short, then to the moon!

Edit: ^ this is my worst case scenario, FOMO may lead us back past $20 by Wednesday

Out of all the big social media companies, Facebook really is the worse. their main app blows and is filled with boomers and Karen's, Instagram fucking sucks now, they just copy whatever the new social media is and implement it's features in the shittiest way possible. Just try using their stories feature, my god it's like navigating a minefield with your finger to avoid bringing up an extra menu or webpage that you give up after 2 pages and just get off your phone. Like the only reason ive managed to open your app was because my brain was on autopilot in mindless consumer mode at 3 am, forcing me into popups makes me remember why I don't use your shitty app and you lose screen time. Everytime I go on the app I fucking hate it. Snap, Twitter, reddit, everywhere has the mindless scroll down way better then instagram, sure I still feel like a dumbass when I realise I just watched 5 minutes of a fucking fortnite top tens clip on snapchat when i don't even play the game, but atleast they kept me on the app like their goal is intended to be. It just feels like a chore to get any content from Instagram, enough to get me to write a paragraph about how shit the app is at 3 am to the only sub I know where it fits to talk about a company being stupid.

If you think companies give two shits about anything that doesnt impact profit that youre really naive.
You are right that higher minimum wage is one of those things that sounds like a good idea, but might not actually help people.  However, countries like Denmark that have high minimum wage also have a suite of interconnected social policies that keep income inequality in check and support working class people.

Do I want to live in Denmark? no

Its not extaggerated at all. Noone will say anything because they have their manufacturing in china, and noone gives a shit about human rights when theres money involved.

This is not about people not knowing about ity they just dont care
Same as Tesla’s. Quit spreading BS

Dude, did you diamond hand this? Lucky if you did. I took what I could (25% loss after averaging down as much as I could stomach) because theta was killing me 1 cent a day and no apparent hope. I did roll my options forward but I wish I just held my original contracts (stupid stimulus effect was delayed by a week).
ICLN $35 EOW

Yup, they're looking at me. The guy who bought PLTR at $33.

Don’t forget my boi GDXJ
Nah they’re fucking with billionaire rights.

Thought I was gonna be smart and top up on green stocks before tomorrow. Everyone a step ahead 🤣
We could be dipping under 20 for the next 2 weeks actually. Heck, I wouldn't be surprised to see the price dip below $18 even.

That said, unless Shermanator omnichannels us again with the holiday sales numbers, I'm convinced the price touches $30 before March 2021.

Which is why I'm all in on GME. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌙
Oh man creativity here is always up to date !

Lolol
If Jack ma is missing since October, why do we only know it now?

Seriously who the fuck is this guy?
Fair price is 30? That’s a PE of 5 for sales this year. You sir are not good at this. PE of 15 which is considered low for sales in 2021 would put this stock much higher than its current price. Don’t speak if you don’t know what you’re talking about

It’s insane that peasants don’t understand that raising minimum wage hurts people the most. 

Big corps will just raise prices, passing cost of higher wages to consumers, or they can automate and fund through low rates.

Also, it make big corps larger since small businesses can’t handle minimum wage. I think they should raise minimum wage more so stonks will go up more to eliminate competition from small business and big corps, stonks, will have higher market share
That would release some stress
Vix goes up with swings right?
this is in no way worse than Hertz
why have puts after it already dumped 35%

Right and they have been doing it for 80 years. No one really cared before and no one really cares now. There is nothing leaders of other countries will do about it.
Imagine being invested in some steel company (probably with cost basis of 25.50) that loses money while any other meme stock is returning 50pct/month. Hey at least you didn't buy pltr at 33!

They would probably get it for a good price considering the current situation no?
What the fk is going on
Alright autists I know I give you guys a lot of shit but we need to have a real talk here. So, this opening is going to be the last time you see NIO anywhere near the 40s, last chance to be an official dip buyer before this thing rockets past ATH and throughout 2021. Do not sell this stock, even if it dips on certain days or times it will get bought up and go higher. This thing is going to pull a Tesla this year
Good point, you should double down.

21 with 28k CAD you could qualify as savings considering I haven't got expenses here. I'm trying to make as much as I can now before my mom makes me move because I know bills will bite me in the ass later, even with a better job than I have now. I think I'm doing good for now but who knows with the World going to shit. I saved a bunch of fucking money by disliking the taste of alcohol to the point of abstinence too, I guess that was a win, at the cost of missing out on potential social interactions.

The reason no one is really doing anything about it is the same reason no one did anything about it back then.

The problem is that Rocket is at the top of its cycle. And yes, interest rates will probably remain depressed for another 1-2 years. However, most of the refinancing already took place over the last 9 months. This will slow down **hard** and will show on future ERs. This doesn't mean they aren't a good company that prints cash. They are. But, a booming business doesn't necessarily mean a booming stock price. It's all about future growth. I think that growth will stagnate. Not only did most refinancing already take place, there is only so much market share (realistically) that RKT can capture (they're already at 10%). Also, home prices are now ridiculously high, while people are not taking as many loans anymore (banks aren't lending nearly as easily as they did in 2004-2007. If you're not making 6 figures, no bank is going to give you a $400K loan).

Lastly, tutes hold because it's generally a good **and** safe investment, not because a stock has 50-100% upside potential. RKT is a safe investment. But, I don't think it has the ability to double from here. That should have happened already, and it did not. Too many downside risks at play (interest rates rising eventually, top of the cycle already, close to **realistic** max market share, home prices too high for people to purchase over the next year). Not a 🌈 🐻 on RKT, just playing devil's advocate.

Yeah I was in pltr but I kept poking it with a stick and it wasnt doing anything so I went all into gme. I'll look into psth I've seen memes but know nothing. You think shares or calls ? Or some of both ??
Try to type IDDQD as a ticker for more ammo.
If you're retarded, which seems to match your description. My best advice is to pick any company that has gained 100% in the last year. Practically guaranteed to just as good this year.

The tl;dr is that stonks go up until like mid-January, when maybe something to do with the GA election will stop them going up, maybe. If you don't believe me, here's some greeks and big words.

There's a grain of truth, volatility might go up now that everyhing else has been priced in, so if you're bicurious, get some hedges.
I see it at between 50 and 50.5 presently in premarket, via IBKR. So it seems that IV will pop nicely for you. Btw it was upgraded by GS on Jan 1st to $59.

Very true.  I try to play to volatility with these SPACs as they seem to pop and drop a few times throughout the process.  This one, I do not own however.  For me, it seems high, but at the sametime, you don't get the reputation of Bill Ackman without being amazing at what you do.  Best of luck to you Pal!
I bought then wrote covered calls on it like a dummy
RIOT up bigly
What strike?
Say what you want about boomers but at least their trading platform is excellent. Same can't be said about RH.

Its ok GME and PLTR stayed behind for you.
How about replace whip with hammer and sickle.🙈
You're clearly not hearing me.  FA is, always was, and will be king.  But you keep on with your astrology.  My backtesting using low lag indicators from DSP and other disciplines confirmed this.

Who cares if you "bought the top" of PLTR?  Anyone who did their FA might be disappointed in the short-term if they bought at 33, but FA isn't about day trading.

Good luck.  You're gonna need it.
Yeah it’s not even close.  They’re in prison because they committed a crime, not praising a different god like in China.
You can’t even began to fathom how good you have it. So entitled.

I think you people are insane for betting on Gamestop. Consoles are already produced without disk drives, nobody goes to Gamestop to buy peripherals, their transition to digital is 10 years too late. If I want to buy games digitally I buy them on Steam, PSN or xbox live. Gamestop is as irrelevant now as it was last year and will crash soon once the delusion fades.
What happens after they do know about it? Anything the U.S can do except for sanctions? (Despite them hurting the U.S more than China since China has all the economic leverage) What is awareness going to do? Oh yes, all the #prayforuighurs really gonna stop the suffering, that's right.

ETFs are boring pussy ish
Stock options are a financial instrument that allows markets to do, not only price discovery, but discovery of the entire predicted distribution of outcomes for an equity as a function of time (under some assumption on the class of price distributions).

WSB uses them as lottery tickets.  An opposing faction--the "theta gang"--tries to make money by selling them lottery tickets.  Hedge funds and market makers realize that neither group understands the underlying instrument, and this allows them to (i) do arbitrage on options prices (like "convexity arbitrage") and (ii) manipulate stock prices in the short term, thereby distorting outcomes and screwing over both gangs.

A third, much smaller group, knows that most hedge funds don't actually understand the math underlying models like Black-Schoels and where it is most likely to fail.  They are able to exploit HF's poor modeling, but only to the tune of $10-50B/year in total, a relatively small sum in the global economy.
I appreciate that. I’m in for a few hundred shares at $25.50 right now and thinking about adding to my position. A dip would actually be pretty appealing to me
You mean the "bers r fuk" ones or the "PLTR 🚀🚀🚀" ones

the dude that consciously threw away like $20k-something (or maybe more) on an SPY FD was depressing as fuck to see

regarding financial success and intelligence, there is some correlation because you do have to be able to understand some basic math and have comprehension skills

what's more important though is energy, persistence, and aggression or drive. that is one common factor among all people who hit it big

the other important factor is luck, which is completely beyond anyone's control

Doesn't take a genius to figure that.
The question is when? Timing is key.
You can still get rekt on your puts if your timing is off by even 2 months. You miss your mark, you won't have even a penny left to short Tesla when the time does come. You wait for the crash to happen to go all-in, it's already over. It will happen in a flash.

I burned 20k in a month doing otm calls on spy. If I had been less autistic and done it to tesla I'd likely feel different. So the last 4 weeks I did small bets on tsla and made a few k, but the stress and time investment just doesn't seem worth it. Overall long positions on growth has worked overtime.

Don't get me wrong I understand wanting to flush my parents with "I made it" money. But if you keep grinding your chances go from 0.0001% yolo wins to 25% on compounded accumulation.

You'd be right. In economics it's well known that the economy does not reward people in proportion to the marginal utility of their work. There is a lot of luck involved.

I've seen old industrial companies with 3x debt to book, yet still 'profitable' and included in major indexes. Book cooking isn't that hard if you have lots of assets. You can jack up goodwill or asset estimated value almost as you please. That's why I barely ever look at EPS. FCF is my true love.

stop loss is great and all but if STIC closes at $15 tomorrow and then opens up the next day at market open gapping down at $10, you will not be able to sell it at 14 and you would lose a hell of a lot selling that many shares at $10. Sometimes I wonder if stop loss is worth it.

oh then HSA doesn't seem worth it to me if you are young and don't have any real current major health expenses? I know health expenses can always pop up at anytime but if one cannot take out contributions and one doesn't have health expenses at the time, HSA seems a waste because you won't be able to touch that money for a long time. What would a person use it for with no health expenses? General monthly insurance premiums maybe? However, I agree with you on 401k being last since its pre-tax and for young ppl that might not be an advantage, and I agree on Roth since one can always take out contributions while the rest grows but I just don't see the point of HSA.

May be its not worth for them. I know BP, airbus and F1 story and government story. Customer fit and acquisition will only get better in time. Hopefully they take lessons from these two deals and build on it. We will see

That was certainly my question. Wouldn’t expect $1.5-2m cash (entire trading account less rough 2020 tax bill) would get you a lot of calls to be part of core SPAC (credible) investor base. So if it’s legit and OP has relationship-d his way in, this seems a sweetheart deal that he should jump on!
Any chance PSTH can take In N? Out public?  its owned by one girl who inherited it. could probably expand all over the country with proceeds.

Futures are looking so STRONG, TOO STRONG that I honestly am afraid it's gonna crumble up until open. NO way it can look so good so sexy so early on right? Right?!
N
If you front ran the support, then you prob got burned but that's the risk of front running. If you bought at the top and still haven't stopped out then you're probably not using TA correctly lol also how many people did FA and bought the top of PLTR?

I would say FA is arguably worse right now when everything is so detached from fundamentals more so than ever. Also, it works better for long term trading but I'm talking mainly short term here cuz I only trade short term. If fair value is $xx, how long is it gonna take to get to that price if ever? My style is quick bets for big moves with stop losses instead of buy and hold.

If the market was completely efficient then yes, TA would be unnecessary and FA would be king but it's not, especially in the short term. There are ups and downs for seemingly no reason with no changes to fundamentals. There are better companies valued lower than worse companies and vice versa. Fair value is different across sectors, etc. I would rather not mess with all that and trade based off technicals and the rules I set using them but to each their own lol

Get a pack of turkey wings from the store, along with a jar of jerk marinade from the international aisle (or a can of diced tomatoes, if you're a baby). Put the wings into a large ziploc with about a tablespoon of oil and either the contents of the marinade jar OR your usual salt/pepper/garlic powder/paprika seasonings. Add a tablespoon of lemon juice if you have it. Massage the bag to coat the wings: you can do this a day in advance and let 'em marinade OR set the bag aside while you handle the rest of the prep, if you want to be eating in 30ish minutes.


Quarter 1-2 onions (to taste!), and cut 2-5 potatoes (peeled or not, your choice) into large chunks (I cut them in half, then cut each half into 6-8 pieces depending on spud size). Peel and crush as many garlic cloves as feels appropriate, then dump all of this into the pot. If you're using the tomatoes, add them now, with the liquid. Add capers too, if you like them. Next, take your wings and lay them on top, in one layer (two if that's the only way to fit it, that's fine). Add chicken broth to the pot until the wings are in but not _covered_ by the liquid. If you don't have broth, use water (Dump a chicken ramen seasoning packet or soy sauce or something in to season it, preferably). Cook for 15-20 minutes on the "poultry" or "pressure cook" setting, until turkey is cooked and tender, but not falling apart.


If you used jerk marinade, serve over rice. If you used tomatoes, serve over rice or pasta (you made turkey cacciatore).

My point on Palantir was that if you needed a PhD for every sector you invest in, you'd have no investments. Memes are cool tho. ARKG is not available in Europe. Since you said you know other companies far ahead in the process of getting FDA approval for the same therapy, can you name them? I'll look into those.  Thanks!

Don't care too much about news although I do follow it to get a general feel of the sentiment but it's pretty much unnecessary and it's also misleading quite often lol I use TA for short term trading like day trade to 2-3 days max. Don't care about fundamentals at all either since I usually don't hold anything more than 3 days max. There are certain trades where I go in thinking I'll hold for a week or two but that's a different type of trading than my usual strat.

For a simple example, let's say I'm looking to pick up calls for PLTR tomorrow if it hits 23 then bounces cuz I have it marked as support. It falls through 23, I don't buy since it didn't bounce. It bounces and trade goes my way, great. It bounces but falls shortly after, I stop out. It doesn't quite get there and bounces, then I might just enter since it bounced even before getting to support or I may not since it's not one of the scenarios for entry. 

It doesn't matter what kind of news came out that day since by the time we retails get the news, it's old news anyway. You can just trade purely on technicals and react faster lol like I said before, it helps me set entries and exits, and helps me base my trading on something with rules, etc.
Whats your opinion on Home Depot and Cocacola ending their relationship with PLTR stating it wasnt worth the cost and they could have done it inhouse? I hear two extreme sides where one says pltr has awesome software capabilities while the other side is trashing their platform as confusing and simple to the point a baby could write a better program, let me know what you think thanks
Silver too? Everyone keeps saying this. What are the technicals that show this?

That would have done it for example.

That's my strategy!

My long calls aren’t that long out to 2022 but I have most of them expiring June. MRNA is the only that is expiring in may. I am data analytics and finance major did a ton of technical analysis on MRNA and put a price target of 165 don’t know what happened. I have to recalibrate some of the variables. But I am very conservative on long options most of the airlines I have going up about 5%. I don’t know I can’t figure this market out. I presume it might pick up by February but that just a guess on intuition.

If democrats take Georgia, get ready for another $2,000 stimulus injection also buy as many guns as you can because you can be sure there another round of gun sale restriction around the corner.
Damn dude
Here was RH response when I asked them about it:


Thanks for reaching out. I'd be happy to provide more detail about your account restriction.
 
Your restriction was a result of day trading while you were in a Day Trade Call, and is not due to pattern day trading.
 
When covering a Day trade call, your deposit must first settle before your restriction is lifted. Once the deposit is complete, then the Day trade call is considered met. Since a day trade before then, while your day trades were restricted, this caused your account to be further restricted from making any purchases for 90 days.
 
We are unable to remove this restriction from your account until the end of the 90-day period. Bringing your account above $25,000 will not impact the restriction on your account.
 
I understand that this probably isn’t the ideal resolution for you.
It's an amazing way to cash out before the apocalypse, though.
This is the way

Closing means to buy back the option that you sold. You do this to either take profits or to roll your option you sold.

Example:

Sold a AMD 100c 1/8/21 for a .86 premium

After 3 days, option is now worth .20 due to theta decay.

Buy back option for .20 for a .66 or $66 dollar gain.
idk bro some people are talking about a crash coming
Even gold and silver moving. If I didn't know better I'd say someone is printing trillions of dollars or something.

So for volumes looks normal for HKX though, not seeing anything looking like a big sell off.

We'll see what happens with NYSE.
If the price of said option goes down and you want to profit take in case the Stonk moons
With our luck it will be red by open
You buy back the option off the market, which counteracts the one you sold and ‘closes’ your position
When a stock cracks a whole number like 700 and it’s a new ATH. Buy that shit. Price action tells you all you need to know.

Nah it’s real, only for margin accounts. I covered my call but had to sell my weekly AMZN position the next day and I guess you need to wait 2-3 days for the call to clear before you place another day trade or they restrict you from buying for 90 days. I can’t buy shit on RH now and they told me there’s nothing they can do about it. My account was about 50k my money and 8k margin when it happened.

Ma is mostly a puppet/face for Baba since i woulda say 2016 so everyone can relax. Baba isnt like Tesla, where Elon makes up 90% of its valuation.
Jail or death. CCP tries to do that to all the billionaires that get too powerful
Where he later
Shorting this stock doesn't really make total sense. Sure, the short plays might eventually turn profitable in 2022+, but time is a factor in this kind of market.

There were hundreds of other stocks to long or short for far quicker and bigger profits. Yet, shorties chose to maintain and increase their short positions even after it became apparent that GameStop will NOT go bankrupt in 2020 and 2021 and enter into yet another next-gen console cycle, making it, at least temporarily, profitable.

All that money that's bleeding right now could've been allocated into INSERT\_ALMOST\_ANY\_TECH\_STOCK\_HERE and they would've been in the green bigly, instead of having to wrangle this huge losing short position.
Damn Carmen didn't age well.

Excellent writeup. Very easy to understand and based on very rational notions. We've just been continuing the pattern of the Greenspan puts.

"I get a sense of pride in this noble cause, as a member of WSB community" - What a kind and generous community we are. I have no doubt we will be vilified in the next crash as a major contributor to the mania, but know that our YOLOs made the world a better place by accelerating EVs and renewable energy.

You are probably completely right in your assessment. There are a lot of hurdles for GME to overcome.

But, in this irrational bull market, it likely won't matter in the short term, when GME posts a few good quarters and the stock price shoots past $30, $40. The only losers are gonna be those that don't sell at least part of their positions once this goes 3x+ and wait for the price to deflate back into low 20s again.

I don't believe this MOASS will happen, far too many small investors and holders for something like that to happen. I also find it stupid how shorties haven't covered earlier in 2020, it wasn't hard figuring out that the price will rebound on next-gen console cycle, at least temporarily. Maybe it never touches the old console cycle market caps, but it will, I mean, it HAS ALREADY multiplied.

Cohen is an X factor. He may or may not save the company in 2022 and beyond, but for now, it's good to have him around as a periodic positive catalyst.

I'm a retard, but I'm not just blindly yoloing lol I'm yoloing based on my reasons to enter or exit a trade based on the rules I've set according to my TA lol it's really not hard haha if I have a price level set as resistance where price struggled at multiple times before and the price breaks above I'll buy calls, if it rejects I'll buy puts. It's an oversimplification but it's pretty much just guiding my trading instead of just buying when something is going up and selling when it's going down.

Super interesting post! Given what you wrote, share your insight on something like $LIT a super specific ETF on lithium companies many of which retail wouldn't be able to buy in bc they are foreign entitities.

I get GA is republican stronghold generally, but the people just had fatter stimmys taken out of their hand by a republican senate and now they are supposed to vote for 2 people who were accused of insider trading at the beginning of the pandemic (Kelly) and insider trading throughout his career (Purdue)? 

They literally just watched their calls drop from 2k to $600 in a single senate session and can point directly to the downfall of their theoretical calls. Now you expect them to go out of their way on a Monday to double down on that stock in person by voting for two 🌈🐻??? 

Idk man. Seems bold. McConnell cut the power to the printer and Daddy Trump is mad, this is a lot closer than it should be and as OP said it's one hell of a unique opportunity for some calls.

While I agree with him saying that anyone that says they know what's gonna happen to the price is complete BS, I'm saying it's not just random patterns. Even if TA is "random patterns", it can help guide you with your trading and help take the emotions out of it by setting rules based on something.

TA gauges probabilities at key levels and helps you set entries/exits and suggests when to hold instead of just buying when something is going up and selling when it's going down. You can use it predictively to front run to take on more risk for possibility of a better entry or you can use it reactively for less risk, but worse entry.

If you don't believe in it or don't need it then don't use it lol I just don't get all the hate surrounding it lol

Yeah, fuck it. I already decided I'm going all in on some 1/15 calls for Cronos and Canopy. Election results could take a few days to a week, so I don't feel good about 1/8. Worst case scenario Republicans win, I lose it all but I'll make it back in time for the next catalyst. Best case Dems win and fucking rocket🚀🚀 thrusters engage straight to tendy town💸💸. And I mean  LITERALLY fucking sky rockets since it would mean marijuana is in the best place it's ever been in modern history with a clear path to decriminalization and the ability for marijuana companies to access finance. Imagine most big companies today without access to next to any forms of reasonable capital. Pot companies pay extreme premiums for debt, if they can get any at all. 

I get it's a long shot for 2 Democrats to win GA that hasn't had a democratic senator in 20 years, BUT Bitch McConnell interestingly made this a real election. People really don't like having money taken out of their hands, and conservatives really don't like seeing things like "gender studies" which McConnell had no problem passing. Also, Trump isn't exactly inspiring the masses to vote considering he was just recorded asking for votes like a loan. "Come on, I just need 20k and my business will boom!." "I just need 11,xxx votes." We will see what his tone is tomorrow in GA. 

Plus, if the Dems do win pot stocks will 🚀🚀🚀🚀 then fucking 3x 🚀🚀🚀🚀 when the MORE act or similar is passed, and then fucking 10000x 🚀🚀🚀 when we get national medical marijuana within the next 3-4 years. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 And then a billion times 🚀💸🚀💸🚀💸 on legalization in 5-10 years depending on 2024. Think about riding the catalyst waves all the way to Papa Jeff's holy grail of a marketplace. Prime delivery on dank? 

Printers will print so hard they will moan daddy powell. 

Credentials: work in marijuana industry so I don't mind making a big risk on it considering the marijuana industry is why I have it in the first place, also lived in GA 15 years (so have tons of GA friends on social media that LOVED Trump, they aren't happy and none of them are encouraging friends and family to vote. None.), and also a conservative not happy with Bitch McConnell.

Here in lies the randomness of the markets, thats why sometimes it works and sometimes it doesnt. Doing this on the 1-min timeframe is dangerous as the algos most of the time will beat you but as you move out (5min, 30m) you can get more accurate hits. then its all about risk management

but this is wsb so just buy calls and print tendies
Ew, That’s the guy who sold covered calls on GME at $9 and lost out on $50,000 in gains for a $228 call premium

Yeah a linear relationship between the effort increase and the pay increase is incremental in terms of overall state of life assuming you don't hate your current job. 

Working 1.5x as hard for 1.5x the pay above ~70k isn't going to do anything for you. There are some studies around this. The extra time would be better spent doing something you truly want to be doing.

There are other factors too, but I don't know you so I can't give great advice.
You are retarded
>If you are trying to pay in Yuans with your UnionPay card, it's not going to work. You need to add credit card that local bussines allow, Master, Visa, Dinners. Can't pay with Unionpay.

so since PLTR is effectively controlled by Karp, Thiel, and that other autistic dude, what would stop them from voting to take the company private and forcing us all to sell our shares for $0.50
Worth gambling

Not much. This was 10 years ago now. I went to University of Arizona and this was just a (very small) party on a Friday. A guy in my frat was filming a video and this was a still shot from it. 

At the time we just thought it was hilarious that my boy in the very middle (who was completely fucked up) hopped in the frame with his glasses all crooked. He’s the only one in the photo I still talk to.
There was literally no reason for him to purchase to his current level if he weren’t all in.  Bears are fucked.  

Worst case scenario IMO is $50, which would still 2.5x most of us.

I wanna say limit down but this market is retarded.
Shares are the way.
You mean the pump on price? Because I was talking about how much they are making like.. the money they earn after selling services. This looks to be $0. I assume the price is going up because they anticipate to make money in the future and it’s all based around the ability to make something and hopefully be profitable
I’m liking the reverse psychology on PLTR where everyone is now saying a slow increase over time.  Now that no one is expecting it, $80 EOW.

I don’t want this to become a NIO thread but reading from your post, it seems like you are not updated: 

1) NIO has battery swapping stations.  Here is NIO subsidiary:  https://youtu.be/92wtNQz0Emg

2) NIO owns XPT which makes the powertrain:  https://www.xptglobal.com/cn/

3) NIO is releasing a new sedan and a 150 kWh battery pack this week (better range than Tesla):  https://twitter.com/NIOGlobal/status/1345947500511780865?s=20

4) NIO just had a record monthly car delivery (7007 vehicles; 121% growth vs 2019):  https://twitter.com/NIOGlobal/status/1345792706589540352?s=20

Elon even indicated NIO will be Tesla’s main competitor, not ICE companies.  You should download the NIO app.  I am sure you will see how outdated you are.
Anyone really thinks 23.55 is the top for PLTR? Buy that shit at open, don’t be stupid. GME might get propped up for a few more weeks too, but it ain’t going above 20-22.

Infosys is a shitty company and I hate them. Every contract companies I have worked with regretted it. However, they are capable of under bidding anyone else and the have the manpower to throw bodies at the problem until it is fixed.

Assume 1.5 hookers a night, you’d run out of money in about a quarter.

I trade equities futures, “move” does not mean liquidity, most of the moves in Asian market is mostly due to the lack of liquidity and big players washing out small potatoes. From my experiences, it is not advisable to trade in these hours. You might as well just trade Nikkei. But don’t think there’s much difference if you are swing trading options. Two different things. No experience in that department.

I think more so for other GYNA companies than for BABA. BABA is established, and Ma’s not a part of the exec team anymore.

I don't think you're a racist if you can't see how the US commits and has committed plenty of crimes that are comparable to what's being claimed of china. I do think you're missing the bigger picture.

How many times has the west used crazy propaganda to demonize our new baddies? Are you aware of the legacy of Hearst's media empire and the anti communist propaganda that was literally born from Nazi Germany?

Most of the people pointing this shit out aren't even tankies, they just feel that it's appropriate to question the western narrative that continues to drive imperialism and needless wars/cold wars that seem to enrich the military industrial complex and leave us with crumbs. I personally don't believe the uighurs are being systemically organ harvested or whatever. The people who have pushed this are not really trustable given their weird hyper religious background. I'm of the mind, personally, that the Chinese really have made anti radicalization camps to combat uighur Muslim radicals. Does that mean these camps are kosher? Fuck no, just like Guantanamo is a shitstain on our country. Do I think its impossible that uighur women are being abused in said camp? I'd be stupid to assume they aren't, anyone who understands Asian society (insider/outsider mentality) knows that the people in these camps will be abused one way or another.

I'm rambling ( typing on a phone with ADD blows), but honestly I've been one of those people in those articles reminding others of America's wrongs and the point isn't to say that China isn't capable of doing a lil imperialism themselves (as a snack!), But to get people to question the narrative theyre being fed.

Frothy valuations with a long time to go before they actually have a target. It should be trading at a small premium at best - maybe in the $10.50 range, right now spacs are in a huge bubble.

Mickey can successfully say “Fuck You” to fair use, not just by challenging it in the courts, but also by changing the rules of public domain every 30 years.

I have certifications to consult for both SAP and Salesforce products as well as Tableau. SAP will continue its decline over the next few decades as a dying legacy tech that only old companies and the government uses because switching costs are too high. Salesforce will rise and fall in a similar pattern. Slack is good, but they overpaid for it. My investing time-frame for Salesforce is bullish for the year or two, then probably bearish in the VERY long term.

My DD is based solely on how many recruiters email me. SAP consulting gigs have dropped to zero several years back. Salesforce gigs have been waning. Past year, Tableau has been like half of the emails.
My parents used to get a solid 3-5% interest by just keeping their money on their bank account.

Pardon me Madam.... want sum fuk??
No ✨
By “many” catalysts I’m guessing one of the main ones you are referring to is FSD. I can assure you that until FSD has a material impact on Tesla financials(more so than it currently does since ppl pay for FSD upfront) you aren’t going to see a big stock increase (other than perhaps a temporary hype based spike). And that’s not going to happen until the regulatory environment becomes clearer. 

The only real catalyst on the horizon imo is cybertruck which imo will sell much better than even bulls are expecting. 

Just my opinion anyways, I’m sure there will be plenty of Tesla and Elon surprises ahead

Depends on what your definition of “make” is, some would argue LG/Panasonic/others are the ones “making “Tesla’s batteries. But if you want to go by the former definition, GM and VW are also “making” their own batteries. And the second part is wrong, selling batteries by themself would be a very low margin business.

Risk is pretty minimal at this point imo. Fundamentals supporting price. Lots of upside left. Plenty of other stocks out there at ATHs. GME is close to its bottom. Interesting to see that people find GME risky when looking at it from this angle. 

Bias clouds their thinking. Many investors just can't shake that 'going to zero' bear thesis that has been beat into investors for years.

Yes, but the actual control of the chamber would be in the hands of Schumer as leader instead of McTurtle, meaning he would control what legislation even gets considered in the first place. Plus Dem control would pretty much cinch all of Biden’s more progressive choices for cabinet (even with the more conservative Dems). It would be a big difference. Even conservative Dems are open to tax increases and additional regulation, just not to the same level as someone like AOC.

And the BULLS with the hat trick from red to green
That’s because a lot of Japan is still rural and they have amazing high-speed transport so it doesn’t matter where you live, which means supply and demand is spread out for the entire country, which is a different scenario to what I described in my comment.

They also mastered density which included reasons of the above, so again, demand was not a huge issue.

They also had a severely declining birth rate and wasn’t too keen on immigration, so population wasn’t a problem.

Any other examples besides Japan?

IMO Alibaba is a pretty decent company with a good business plan and a huge market share. It’s share price was in the $170-$200 range for a few years.

Recently the shares went to $300 on hopes of gains from the Ant financial IPO as Alibaba owns something like 25% of Ant. It looks like the Ant IPO will be suspended because Jack Horse was running his mouth so shares have fallen back to the $200 range.

Idiots on this thread are mad because they followed the crowd late to the party and bought near ATH, then we things went wrong they held on too long and lost moneys. 

It’s kind of like idiots who go outside in winter without a jacket then complain it’s cold.

Be careful dealing with China in business, stocks, whatever. The Chinese viewpoint is that if you get cheated it is your own fault for being gullible enough to fall for the trick.
In honour of the recently deceased Jack Ma, I’ve compiled a few of my favourite quotes of his. 🥰

“Philanthropy is not about helping others, it's about helping yourself.”


“Intelligent people need a fool to lead them.”


 "My favorite movie is 'Forrest Gump.' He said nobody makes money catching whales, people make money catching shrimps.”


"Of course, you're not happy when people say 'no.'"


“ Most people die tomorrow evening."

Im convinced PLTR will drop down to $15 due to wsb keep fucking posting about it .
I don't know if it's gonna crash, I hope it doesn't as I have 20% of my portfolio in ARKF and ARKQ. The thing is their AUM went up like crazy so they are essentially the largest stakeholder and account for a lot of the daily volume for small caps. This is great when inflow continues. My thesis is that now that they have gone viral, there are a lot of paper hands who might sell at the first dip (when it's supposed to be a 5 year hold as per Cathie). When there's a big sustained outflow what do you think will happen to the small caps, they will get crushed as ARK will need to sell to maintain the proportion of holdings in the fund. Sources for the AUM and daily volume are https://twitter.com/EconomPic/status/1341803730304262144?s=19 and https://twitter.com/KermitCapital/status/1343705783171751938?s=19

I'm a supporter of both. But why is whistleblowing in the US not protected by the first amendment? Isn't whistleblowing when the first amendment is needed the most? And right when it's needed the most, it's simply taken away from people. There is no free speech in America. There's just perceived free speech. You can say anything you like, but if it harms American interests, you lose that right. Doesn't seem that far off from China to me.

Saw a WSJ YouTube vid bout COVID economy and tax laws. Had a CEO on there who paid 7% tax rate on 8 figure income last year. I pay way more than that and make sub 100k. Hmm maybe there is an issue here. Also the IRS has publicly stated and released reports showing that those making under 120k/yr are audited at an extremely higher rate due to IRS basically not being able to afford the process and time it takes to audit high net worth individuals and fight their lawyers. They don't have enough master lvl auditors/tax examiners to successfully do that. Hmmm maybe there is an issue here.
Yep, Im all over this

I looked into this a long time ago. I kind of forgot mostly everything. But I think I remember, as long as you make a reasonable attempt to keep it private and you’re in your own home then you’re fine

If he's threatening violence, that is cause for involuntary commitment. If they're able to get him at all stabilized then, when he's in a better state of mind they might be able to persuade him to sign an advanced psychiatric directive that will go into effect if he has another acute episode. It sounds like in this state, he's going to end up in an institution of some sort, either a hospital or jail. A hospital is a better spot.

Well yea, you can't talk someone out of schizophrenia. The paranoia and delusion are very real for them. If it really is schizophrenia they need serious help before they harm others or themselves. If it's an episode where you feel in danger call 911 and tell the dispatcher they're schizophrenic. The paramedics will handle the situation.

I wish, i can explain my understand in few words. Let me try, AWS, Google and MSFT even with megaclouds and in-built AI/Analytics capabilities lack the pace of the scaleup and speed of Palantir. When it comes to security, Palantir has an edge, also Palantir application team works hand in hand with client team and this embedding of team is better than big tech.

I made an image but posting an image in reply in Reddit is pain
That bear thesis has been parroted for years. It was widely believed to be correct until recently with the release of new consoles. The addition of Ryan Cohen just makes it worse for bears because part of the bear thesis for years has been management incompetence.

Guess what. Your argument is a bad thesis at the moment. The company is making moves to improve and the share price is reflecting all the moving parts that are bullish. People were assuming YEARS ago that this current generation of consoles would be the end of discs. It wasn't. Not even close. Physical to digital console sales are 5:1

No idea what you mean by being 'completely frozen out of the consoles'. That bit doesn't even make sense. MSFT is clearly supporting GME. 

Feel free to be bearish on physicals gaming, but maybe wait 5 years before buying puts for that reason alone.

Comma AI is what you are comparing Tesla FSD to? Very different ball games here - I can see how they look similar since they are providing similar functionalities now but the ends goals are very different. 

Tesla FSD is Level 5 autonomy when it's ready (obviously it's not there right now).  Comma is an aftermarket add on product and can make no such claims to any level of autonomy.  Functional safety is a critical part of an autonomous system that will be impossible to attain with aftermarket products.  Right now, Comma's systems are toys for hobbyists at best.

One time, a friend and I caught a medium-sized one in a noose we rigged and took turns jumping on top of it for photos. Not long after, we threw a dead rabbit into the swamp where they lived and one came up and grabbed it. The sound that thing made crushing the rabbit immediately made me reevaluate the fuck out of my decision to catch one and actually drag it closer to me much less sit on it.

All statistics are invented metrics. What do you think the indexes are? They're institutional favorite baskets.

It's likely just data from top brokerages on what the largest holdings of retail investors are, which makes sense as a metric here.

Wholeheartedly agree with the premise and conclusions about index funds and passive investing distorting markets in unexpected ways. At this point the largest indices are too big to fail, as so much money is tied up in these funds that track the indices. 
I think higher yield can be found in individual stocks picked carefully based on knowledge not available, or not known, to others, and my investing style is to find out stuff about a company and make a call based on my own views about how successful it will be in future. That said, like everyone else, more than half of my own portfolio is in index funds.

Right, those will burn long term. Long term puts are mostly bought as insurance for those holding shares. If I have 100 shares of Tesla that I bought for $700 each, then I can buy a $700 put for 2023, which guarantees I can sell them and break even until 2023.

TSLA will hit $5k this year not based on fundamentals, but on the markets finally catching up to realizing TSLA is the furthest ahead at self driving. Look at the investor day presentation. They had a problem with FSD confusing bikes on the road vs bikes attached on the back of the car. They pulled training data from the fleet, labeled it, and tuned their model. Real life is billions of edge cases like this.

Look at OpenAI's GPT-3. The best AI we have available and with the largest number of parameters. Self driving is just a battle of who has the most parameters in their neural net, which is gained through more training data.

not talking about that, even if she continues to time the dip perfectly she will run into the problem of parking billions of dollars. You can easily invest a couple of millions into a small cap, once you get to hundreds of millions of dollars you become one of the majority stakeholders. With the massive inflow into ARK what is happening is that ARK is literally the majority holder for a number of companies, for some of these small caps they account for more than 20% of the daily volume... Once there is an outflow of funds, it will be a negative feedback loop for many of these small caps.

I don't know how true, but I read somewhere that most (or at least a lot) of the moves in the Sp500 have been happening in the "Asian" hours recently, so don't want to miss these

tax reporting on the futures options should also be much easier than on stocks/ETF options too i guess

The m/a details will account for hour holdings and you'll be sent documentation clarifying your position prior. 

But tbh you're always better off waiting when it comes to m/a the parent company (buyer) always drops during m/a and the company they're buying always goes up before the announced acquisition.  So you never really get more for less.
Post your position or GTFO
Funny, it's the exact opposite for me. Now that I've managed to save a little, I see how hard won it was and how easily all my hard work can just disappear. I never get that way before cause I was always broke.

Except all the countries without guns have ten times less gun violence than us. You could buy an illegal gun if you had the connections (extremely unlikely), but it'd cost you tens of thousands of dollars due to the massive risk of smuggling firearms into a country that's either mostly banned them or made them very hard to own.

Time to jump ship would have been on vaccine news. Still not terrible but it’s gonna be a slow bleed up from here. Since it’s the new year, you may consider taking profits to move to something more profitable. Waiting another 4 months may save a bit on taxes but unless you’re up $450k or more, chances are your EV moving to more profitable positions would more than compensate for the short term tax hit.
Sounds like you're the one who needs to be tea bagged..

Yoooo you ever hear of a "worst of option trade"😲😳

"We cheapened the premium substantially by taking our exposure through a worst of option: an exotic option that is priced based on a correlation input in addition to the standard inputs for a vanilla option.

you pay a single premium for a basket of options. Worst of option structures are cheaper because the payout is determined by whichever option performs more poorly from the buyer’s perspective. As long as one of the options expires out-of-the-money, the option buyer will lose the entire premium."

(From Quora question about the two smaller time dudes from the big short)
You should rephrase to the real answer: probably very little to do with AI and very likely something that sort of resembles AI was shimmed into some small part of the product so the sales team can say "AI" and the engineers get to have a bit of fun

Right? Different world! 20% down payments were preferred and in a lot of cases required. Super high interest rates. Banks were so picky with passing out a mortgage because they took the risk. These days banks will let you get a loan with as low as a 3% down payment and rock bottom interest rates they’re practically giving homes away to anyone with a credit score. If you look at NAR’s Affordability Index homes are more affordable today than at any point in the last 40 years.

You can toy around even further...open a debit spread, but short a credit spread (with a lesser width) against your initial spread, essentially an uneven butterfly. You will limit directional risk and breakeven. You will maintain short vega and long theta (most likely). Going to dabble with doing this with PLTR
Pretty sure CCP took his shares.
If Palantir does not reach $25 today
Hahahahaha I respect this.

How so?
I’ve been thinking about this too.

RC has 13% of the company and showed his commitment when he went >10%, but he obviously wants more. 

Going into a bidding war would trigger a squeeze and make accumulation impossible. So that’s a no no.

Unless he is loaded with an ungodly amount of calls. 

If he has done it, he might even be able to get the company for free by selling extra calls to the shorts mid squeeze.

The sec fillings are all about securities, not calls. 
Please, correct me if I’m wrong!

Good luck 🤷‍♂️🚀🚀🚀

In my view, that boils down to the identity of the Republican candidates:

Purdue is a previously elected, well-liked candidate with statewide name ID who’s worked his way to his post

Loeffler is an appointed, never previously elected billionaire with little name ID

There’s a theory that it’s psychologically difficult to vote against a candidate you’ve previously voted for. That it’s tantamount to firing someone, and that’s a hard hurdle to jump. The hurdle must be jumped for Purdue, but not for Loeffler

At the end of the day, we don’t really know jackshit until election results are in. I’m just giving my best guess, which could be 100% wrong!

Thanks for the reply and that makes sense. 

I agree completely with you. Most of the noise on this sub is incredibly short sighted and appears to be fomo driven. I was an early BABA holder but sold in 2019.  Picked some shares up 12/24 and plan on getting more if it dumps again this week.
Yeah I would if I had more available capital to really get into it, but I don’t want to reduce anything I’m already in to buy it. Great company though, love everything I’ve heard about them.

Totally fair perspective. If Warnock and Ossoff win, I think it’s by a razor margin. And think warnock wins more votes than Ossoff. Purdue definitely has a better shot than Ossoff. The only change in my thoughts on Purdue’s chances are that he’s stuck in quarantine through Election Day- that’s how I hit my 55% odds for Ossoff. 

I’m not sure the market moves if Purdue and Loeffler hold their seats. A win for both of them is just a continuation, no changes. Interested in your thoughts, though. I’d rather get my bets right on the market than politicians.
There is a reason they are cheap lmao

[deleted]
They are. You use a brokerage - that brokerage is profiting off of you.

The brokerage is backed by financial institutions that will inevitably see a profit off of that brokerage’s success. 

Financial institution funds brokerage -> you pay the brokerage for access to margin (money they borrow from the institution and lend to you) -> brokerage profits the difference

And that’s just one way they profit off of you even when you’re profitable yourself.

For instance, bonus points for those that use RH - they sell your order flow to other institutions. FOR A PROFIT. Which is hilarious, because it’s only recently they even took RH collective holding info  private.

Ok, let's talk about Tesla.

For the record, I do not own any Tesla stock, nor do I own a Tesla car, nor do I plan to own either in the foreseeable future. (I \*do\* own an electric car that I built myself. Love it. Planning to convert my daughter's car soon.)

Here's why I think Tesla's stock value *could* be justified and *may* continue to go up.

1. Tesla is a car company that makes a profit. It's not Amazon. But then, Amazon *didn't* make a profit for a long, long time. Amazon's retail product delivery service still doesn't make a profit. Who could have known that Amazon would beat Microsoft, Oracle, Cisco, Walmart, Akamai and all the others at cloud services? AWS is the meat of Amazon's profits. Who could have predicted this when they were just a book store?
2. Tesla is also a consumer goods company. Solar power is just the tip of the iceberg. Heat pumps, Smart Homes, Satellite Networking... Yes, it's a tech company -- but it's more than that, it's a *BRAND*. Brand is far more valuable than innovation. The story you sell is more effective than the product you sell, *especially* if it's an also-ran product...
3. Musk only knows one way to manage -- like a startup. Still going strong, like a start-up, after all these years.
4. Leverage. Space-X, Boring Co. Tesla and whatever else comes along -- Grid-scale electrical storage? Off-grid self-sufficient housing? Insurance services? They all share tech between them. Tesla's Octo-valve, for instance. Almost certainly was designed by an aerospace engineer at Space-X.
5. Tesla isn't Apple, or Amazon, or Microsoft. It's more like Java (the programming language) in the late 1990s.  Java didn't do anything better than any other language could do. It was a far worse language than many other more suitable, more mature ones. It failed at its main promise (write once, run anywhere!) Most seasoned programmers laughed at it. They said it wouldn't last. And yet...

So, forget about the cars. Tesla is a *brand*. It's a consumer technology-goods company that got it's start with cars, like Amazon got its start with books until it found gold in cloud services. Tesla is still digging, currently using a constellation of satellites... It won't end there. That's guaranteed.

Having said that, keep in mind that any one of IBM, Oracle, Walmart or a dozen others *could* have eaten Amazon's lunch at any time. Amazon was lucky no one tried very hard.

Agree with all of this.  It’a probably more like yahoo or blackberry than Amazon.

Even if it’s Amazon, you’re no longer getting in at the ground floor at this valuation. It’s priced today as if it’s already become Amazon, when they have shitty cars and are struggling to deliver half a million units in one year. Do people think that legacy automakers sitting on hundreds of billions in cash to invest are just gonna roll over and go bankrupt?

You wouldn’t have paid amazons current stock price for an Amazon share in 2000, but that’s essentially what you’re doing with Tesla if you invest today. 

Everyone knows this, but the only thing keeping it afloat is Elon’s never ending hype machine and OTM call options fuckery scaring sellers from jumping back in and getting burned. But when this thing drops it’s gonna drop far and fast. Timing is the million dollar question.

At most top tier SV companies the focus is not on 'amazing', but on shipping features quickly and iterating on them to squeeze more revenue from consumers. They need maybe one staff level eng for that, and an army of drones to code it up. I really hope they don't waste money trying to become a tech powerhouse of some sort.

A trading platform for games would be amazing, but (obviously) Gamestop can't do that right now, and Cohen would need to rebuild the company and its priorities from scratch. Hiring a few engineers is a necessary but not a sufficient condition for what you want.

Why manipulate the market when its already being manipulated

This is the way
It’s like Amazon but you can link up with Chinese factories. So... say you want 1000 spark plugs sold at a primo. You’d buy it there and then can either resell or use. 

You can also buy a lot of “unbranded” US shit. So like weights that are exactly the same as the ones you’d get at Walmart without the logos.

A lot of Amazon businesses are essentially buying shit off baba and reselling on Amazon.

Care to elaborate more? What's wrong with the float?
I don't know what Ma is doing. But I have read what the chinese government is proposing which is common sense regulation of the most dominate company in China. It *actually makes sense.* But people don't read the proposals and instead think "big scary chinese government is going to up-end one of their most valuable companies via nationalization."

Look the dip is warranted, but contrary to WSB thinking, YOU BUY LOW--not stocks that are running to all time highs! This is an incredible opportunity for LEAPS or shares.
RIP to the people here who kept insisting that China's investigation was "nothing" and consequences will be minimal. Ma is getting Gulag'd

There are like, a dozen scifi show episodes and dozens more literary works which explore the myriad flaws and limited value of a perfect democracy such as the karma system.

When you graduate highschool in a couple seasons and start pursuing higher education beyond early classes, you'll learn much to this effect as you get further into accounting and begin learning about how much human psychology and group sociology determines also but the most concrete mathematical truths.

You're on a good path, and your lashing out is expected and understandable from an 18 year old cusping on the ambiguous edge of manhood, caught between centrist societal shifts and peers who still define political attributes on a graph. Eventually you'll shift from peer learning models, just as you shifted from parent learning models a bit before puberty.

You should understand better than most, just how poor a definitively incorrect and Abelist title retard is for neurodivergent human beings and how it might be the wrong ideal to champion, even if it does generate limited sympathetic response, gently pushing the scale by increasing the social face valuation of a particular action(the updoot) in the minds of the insecure, seeking acceptance in every action out of disproportionate fear of rejection.



I'll accept reject for it's informal ambiguity. In limited satirical context I'll accept retard. Under no circumstances, however, will I accept the callous devaluation of those members of society given a different dendritic framework. You won't live the actions down, and risk forming a mask to double down on such decisions as were made in a time of growth and change with limited concrete information available to you, or you'll pretend that was never who you were, either way playing a part, and doing what I am forced to most hours of the day in a species whose survival had relief in part on being the same as your peers. Hiding who I am from a society polarized to limited shades of black and white, generally ignorant of the colors once represented prior to the psychological grey goo, eating novelty and shitting compliance.


If you feel lost, unable to find a way to be you, uncertain if life, park your fanny under a fig tree for a bit. You'll see it with time. And, just to indulge a little as inspired by a fellow in this conversational grid: I love you. Informal meaning, expressive of appreciation for your tenacity in a linear existence and understanding of unseen limitations of an intelligence incased within it's own senses. Just be safe. Live well and die loud, just like you were born.

Here's this one: https://raybb.github.io/random-stock-picker/
So I can still trade that cash once its settled in a couple days but I have to wait from here on out for settlement of funds before selling or buying somewhere else? Or do they restrict all trading for 90 days? Thats what I’m confused about. ☠️
bonds aren't equity. it's a form of loan.
Jack Ma is in a Chinese prison now that he crossed leadership.  People's Republic of China prices it at whatever they think is best. You can trust me on that. Source (am not chinese)

Give barrel aged rum a shot like Ron Zapaca or appleton estate. They can be super similar to bourbon and really smooth. In a old fashioned or Manhattan variant or even just sipping. 

Gin I can't stand either. My wife loves the last word cocktail. Its almost like a Gin Margarita but the pine flavor of gin ruins it for me.
Drop her a hint
They already secured another 5 billion in share sales on Dec 12.  Didn't at all nudge stock price. Tesla trade's against the laws of economics.

5 billion will burn in 3.5- 4months.  Then another share selling.  They didn't hit 500k cars as Elon projected.
