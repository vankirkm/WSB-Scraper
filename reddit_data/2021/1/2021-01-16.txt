So i can double down in my position. Like if I sell now I will have 60k buying power right? I will just buy 60k worth of shares of GME now so my gains will be even bigger. Is that how it works or am I missing something

No such thing
I’m not sure my analysis of that article is completely correct but I believe it’s actually really good for $MP. That’s China playing more of its hands at controlling the export of REEs as a geopolitical tool. I spoke on the role of geopolitics and REEs on my DD post when it was $FVAC before the SPAC completed. My understanding is China is aiming to have more direct control on REE supply chain through tightening its grip on the entire supply chain. My thoughts are it looks to be a double-whammy of benefits for $MP. 

1) by tightening exports and controlling more of the supply chain the price of REEs will probably increase. Companies and countries might begin to get weary of the potential for lessening of exports of REEs and stockpile supplies which would drive current demand up and cause prices to rise. This can be seen by the price of a metric ton of neodymium going up 2000 yuan since yesterday. The market has heard this news and the price went up not down. https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/neodymium

2) China tightening its grip on REEs is another wake up call to the US of the geopolitical leverage China has over the US. There’s trillions of dollars of economic activity in the US that’s reliant on REEs to fuel them and the US knows this and wants to be independent from foreign influence. Think like how fracking caused the US to become energy independent and an oil exporter, this was to decrease the reliance of the US economy on global geopolitics. This action by China may cause the US to invest more into refining capacity in the US and speed up the process. The pentagon already has invested $9.8 million into the REO mill site and would likely do whatever it could to get that ability back. That would speed up and lower the cost for $MP. 

One thing in there they mention is that it could control more of the import market but I think that that wouldn’t be considered cause it doesn’t make much sense from chinas perspective. Last year they increase REE ore concentrate imports by 80% and many of China’s economic initiatives are reliant on REEs. More importantly China is the only place to mill right now so they can maintain the imports from MP while still maintaining their geopolitical pressure. If they stop imports they’d just be lowering the global supply by 15% with no added geopolitical pressure on the US. In addition, Shenghe resources is a Chinese mining company that owns a stake in MP and has a contract to buy all MP ore through 2021 or forfeit their shares in MP which would function as a giant stock buyback. Also China isn’t stupid they know they won’t be able to put the US REE industry out of business as the US gov has said many times their desire to be independent. Even if China stopped imports from MP it wouldn’t put them out of business as the US gov would do whatever is needed to keep the industry afloat

Oh, and their desktop app (TWS) might seem hard to figure out in the beginning, but you'll get used to it

ws likes to assfuck canadians buying US stocks with their absurdly high fees. I love ibkr as you can convert currencies at the actual exchange rate
So, what if he's looking long term?
This margin shenanigans would actually be a fantastic way to outsmart the retail and sink the price pretty heavily from a hedge funds point of view. I am sure they have inside data knowing the percentage of this that’s on margin and what the implications of a margin reduction would be.
I’ll be financially independent by 50 w/ no mortgage, a hot wife & two kids, good enough for me. 🍻
Depends on market price. But right now almost 1300 shares. 

But 47k could get you 626 37c options if you got them for the $0.75 for 1/22 expiration they show right now and that would get you the leverage of 62,600 shares. 

So it’s quite a bit larger

Wtf man. Read something. You can't make shit on GME options right now because the IV is stupidly high. MMs calculate into the price how big of a move the stock might make. The know GME could moon or drill, so you gotta pay a huge premium for calls or puts on that shit.

You make money by weighing IV risk vs. how much you think the stock might move.

Compare this to a company like tesla.. they have so many ideas and the most talented engineers, their only limitations are cash and time. if they accomplish their goals before their competitors, they will have a monopoly for a long time. Im pretty bearish on gme, but realistically, theirbiggest problem is that they are close to bankruptcy and they need to change theirbusiness model asap. For tgat, they need cash and talented software engineers/devs (more cash)

True statement about the leaps. Spent .72 in November on the chance Ford is over $15 by 1/2023. Now it's 1.25, but I imagine that will fluctuate over two years. It's not like they aren't trying to change things.
I love NOK, but it just doesn't move. I had 40K shares the day Elop (Trojan Horse) sold the mobile division to Microsoft. Payed out well then, but just kind of floats around now. It's an incredible company with so much talent since buying Acatel, but still doesn't monetize where they should. Maybe a decent play with the anticipated release of the Nokia 10 via HMD Global. They are releasing it late and should have beaten Samsung to the 5G flagship launch.

Is the sky blue?
There are two squeeze effects

One is the tendency of wsb call holders to sell their calls, causing a dealer to dump 100 shares, and then put them in new securities that cause a dealer to buy fewer than 100 shares at least initially. 

The second is that if the call is near the money, price movements down can cause a dealer to start dumping their hedge. That’s more like the active squeeze.

In opposition though is that as time progresses, itm calls generate buying on flat price as their delta gradually increases.
10k that's it? 

Hmm....

Nothing. I’d argue that Cohen’s primary objective is to turn GME into a successful business as opposed to squeezing out shorts. If he’s planning to completely change how GME does business, seems that he would need more than the $500m in cash currently sitting on their balance sheet, considering he’d need to exit long term store leases and has $250m debt that will be due in less than a year.
Options sellers (most ) are going to hedge their calls with stock purchasing. 

This is how a gamma squeeze works. 

With autists using 10x leveraging buying options we’re forcing most options sellers to cover this call soaking shares as a hedge. 

We’re accomplishing the same thing just on a much larger leveraged scale.
So the move is to not ask what the move is,.
 but the golden rule is to always inverse WSB which means: what's the move here?
He is probably all talk with no position.
Probably? No this is my life savings!

he didnt close the contract, he exercised it (actually turned in the option ticket for 100 shares), so you could say that he "made" the money but its still in the shares (i fucking hope OP)

He exercised so that means he owns the 1000 shares.

Question, and confusion. Most of the call options I’m told to look into have premiums that would cause either net loss or breaking even if the stock meets the called price. Is this “at the money” so when calling I should be expecting the stock to rise much higher than I want to call it at? It looks like no matter what, I want the stock to rise well over the premium amount(duh) but in any case, the stock must go ludacris to make any money, no? I can’t make money calling GME @ $43 for example any date past like 2/5 the premium soaks up the money. And even if they do get to $43 I’d be making like $100 at a cost of $500-600? And if they don’t meet the price they are worthless as opposed to just buying shares how is this beneficial? I may be completely fucked on the math but I’m not seeing the numbers for gains that people talk about on here. 1 GameStop contract called for $43 on feb 26 would bet me less than $100 gained. Why are premiums so high? Seems very risky. Now, I will admit a $47 call would net around $500 if met on the same date. This seems extremely optimistic though. Is the sentiment in this sub THAT optimistic? Why are short calling premiums not much lower than longs? Seems like there’s zero incentive to call near date unless you think it’s rocketing in a couple days by 30%. Am I comoletely wrong and fucked?? 🚀 or?? 🌈 🐻??

Yeha, I'm confused why folks think that's a reasonable PT.
The gain weeks are epic, but the down weeks are depressing and costly. I’ve run my account into 0 a few times over the last year and it was a bull market... be careful, do some safe plays and have a reasonable amount to spend on riskier options. This sub is amazing and can make you a shit load of money, but also beware that we are all degenerate gamblers who are greeedy as fuck and our heads are in the clouds looking for the next 1000% gain or more.
me too
Anybody else here a shareholder in Green Bay Packers Inc.?  Today was a good day.
Jesus... Exactly. I thought I was reading a chat room transcript from Prodigy circa 1995.
I think they still have like 34,000 patents left.

Edit, and they just settled with I think MSFT or someone.
I have no idea what GME will do if it does squeeze, but it might not be just a rise and it sets there.  Or it might.   Point being I think some people will be caught off guard, depending on what it does.   If the squeeze is more gradual then it's going to be like boiling a frog -- so slow you may not recognize it.   If the squeeze is sudden, you may miss it by holding out too long before it dips down (provided it dips down).  I think the VW squeeze only lasted 4 or so days as a massive sharp spike before the price came way down (and never returned to peak squeeze price).

This could be tricky if you're trying to predict the absolute top.   I can't tell you what to do as I'm not a financial advisor or expert, but I already have limits set to auto sell my shares at various prices in chunks.  I won't be kicking myself if it shoots much higher though, because really gain is gain in my book.  As long as I don't sell below my average cost I'm pretty happy.

I do wonder if this is going to last months until the next Earnings Report or if it will be sooner.   (Or if it never truly squeezes in the way we are expecting)
Os that supposed to be an option? I cant find it on Stash

Ah, unfortunately I dropped off the anime at the Dressrosa arc, not because it was *bad* per se, but because the episodes started dragging a bit (recaps started taking up a good chunk of each episode). Maybe I should pick it back up again!
JMIA is more 10 year play than 2 week play.
Bro, you're gonna be fucking aliens on the moon together.
Could it be due to volatility in general?  Once GME breaks, its gonna drop hard.  I think they are scared of both ends.
Because the bb "rocket" was a plant by MM to lure dumb money away from gme to control the squeeze. 

The bb gains are going to be sideways while gme squeezes.

Don't get me wrong, I think data processing and privacy regulation is big business in the future for some companies. I just don't think anyone will pay PLTR to do it, or will want to be associated with them outside of their tiny niche they've carved out.

Frankly if you think their operations with the domestic or foreign military organizations are ethical, I got a bridge to sell you. They are facilitating the analysis of large scale dragnet collection of civilians of various middle eastern and Asian countries.

And these operators I'm sure have a good track record of ethics and concern for human rights... or not.

Stick to porn.  Any face-to-face meetings are probably either police stings or vigilantes looking to blackmail you.
A normal simplifying assumption with ordinary stocks is that all puts are long in end customer hands and all calls are short. With gme I think most vol is short for dealers, so not so many covered calls.

Oh also, Mexico quite literally has a deadline of April for marijuana legalization. They had a December deadline, but it was extended to April. Could be earlier, but I don't see it happening later.

Not so fuk. They’re needed to progress clean energy. Most likely the administration imposes either a credit or tax for harmful carbon emission, that’s the problem. Coal and oil aren’t a problem so much as the carbon emitted from burning them.

Does a service exist that matches true market-savaant autists that are risk averse and money-poor with wealthy but otherwise retarded ham-fisted morons with big balls, bigger bank-rolls and low IQs to go in on market bets together as a team?

Robinhood + Bumble + Upwork type of thing -- best autists would be ranked by total gains and command highest premiums --- I would totally pay for this.

Actually, I am. Is my autistic going off? I’ve been trading for about 8 months now all together but I do a ton of research. Looking for feedback!
That's crazy how much blood have I missed :( I watched subbed but apparently the us version in the beginning
It was someone's bright idea to short 160% of the float of a publically traded company and I don't think the hedgies deserve the blame for that one.
I got into trades few months ago, I told my friends and family about it, then they told me to invest in ETFs. I did. I bought 5 different ETFs and AAPL. I paid so much dollars in conversion fee, and they only went up and down for 1\~2% a day. I would see 50 dollars gain, then 50 dollars loss, then 50 dollars gain... Wouldn't even cover the conversion fee.

A week ago, I said enough of this bullshit. I tried to sell at the best price and still lost 500 dollars in the process. I picked some random tickers from this sub, and read dozens of DD on them to make sure I'm not buttfucked. I bought NIO at one point, but sold as soon as I saw the chinese shill on this sub. Thank fucking god I ditched that chinese fingertrap, it dropped 10% not too long ago. I learned to not fuck with chinese stocks ever again.

BB, GME, SCR.

It took me a week to see 50% gain. Holy fucking shit.

Why even bother getting 10\~12% gain a year if it's going to be covered by inflation anyways??? ETFs are fucking scam. Never again. No risk, no gain.

Fuck y'all who's still scared to buy GME and BB. Grow some hair on your balls and EARN MONEY 🚀🚀

Idk i feel like an old trader or something but offerings used to always be bearish.. it's hilarious that we can have these self feeding cycles of offerings, stock moons, company can issue even more shares for even higher dollar, stock moons some more on "positive cash situation".. what these offerings all are is dilution.. and dilution has historically more often than not been bearish.. literally only 2020 and into 2021 have offerings suddenly flipped bullish.. it's really just an indicator of how optimistic everyone is that they can fucking issue shares and the stock will rally.. it's insanity. We all act like all of these fucking companies are just fan fucking tastic and will for sure all execute the best courses of action for the company, right? All of these little shit companies with no revenue will all do great right? Room for 1000 EV companies, room for 1000 data aggregators all valued in the billions, right? There's room for 1000's of companies doing the same fucking things, and all of them will be valued in the billions? Seriously little far fetched to think this is normal.. none of this is normal, at all.

Yeah 10 million would be low imo. But then these billionaires can give away 10 billion and still be set for the rest of their lives. They could still buy anything they want. Yachts, hookers, cocain, mansions etc.

https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/insider-activity
advice please....I prefer options to stock and realize the risks of the latter due to potential timing problems. I admit this short squeeze is a bit confusing to extrapolate ideal options timing. Is it safe to say the safest move here would be to do the options more in May then the next few weeks? I understand I would make considerably less if it happens soon and I hold May vs. 1/22 or anything soon. Given all we have to work with would you autists recommend later this year rather than next week. I know everyone loves risk here but not looking to leap and lose it all

Yeah in the future it would be better to hold the original lot of shares and then just buy more when you want to. That way your average stays lower. But you still made money so it’s not like you’re ultra retarded or anything. You could’ve been extra retarded and sold at $20 then bought back at $40 or something 🤷‍♂️

I just got done reading Rich Dad Poor Dad. At the moment my advice would be to find a job where you learn a skill that is valued and needed. Then work for yourself.
A short squeeze is when those who sold without owning the shares (shorts) are forced into buying shares because they don't believe it'll go down anymore or because they run out of margin *and* there is more demand than supply. 

It means shareholders can basically dictate the price they are willing to sell to the shorts, because the shorts *have* to cover their losses.

That's my understanding anyway, but I'm retarded.

To the moon!!!!  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
If that were the case no stock in history would short squeeze and every stock on the market would be best to shit since there would be no repercussions for shorting. 

Shorts borrow shares to short, they have to then cover at some point and they buy to cover. 

How shit like with GME happens is when a short borrows from a broker X amount of shares and shorts them they will turn around and borrow more shares from somewhere else, short it and then borrow more. 

With enough people doing this sometimes you’ll have shorts borrowing borrowed shares from each other and you end up with more shares being shorted than available on the market. 

This is essentially what has happened.

Paying off my current mortgage will allow me to put wayyy more money into the market.

Really wondering if wsb has the highest monetary contribution to Reddit.
They make 30-40% on each game sold.it’s the same if they sell it on their site, or game stops sells it. When GameStop sells the game they have less overhead which makes them more money.

As long as they get the same cut it won’t matter. 
Now if GameStop offered them 50% why wouldn’t they take that?

That would be retarded as fuck. This is the history of this war:
- Hedge funds picked GME as a short target because they believed it was destined to fail
- Hedge funds see that they may have been wrong, yet instead of covering and moving on, they abusively manipulated the stock price and published hit articles in an attempt to force GME into bankruptcy
- Cohen comes in, whips that weak ass boomer board into shape, and squeezes out the shorts, sending a clear message that they are not to be fucked with

This is exactly what Germany did when Porsche squeezed the fuck out of the VW shorts. If GME did an offering, they would basically be saying “it’s alright if you fuck me in the ass Melvin, just make sure to leave some cab fare on the nightstand.” Does Ryan Cohen seem like the kind of guy who takes it in the ass to you? DOES HE???

That’s the craziest part. He was betting on GameStop as a company and happened to luck his way into a massive short squeeze lmao

I just hope he has the sense to get out before this thing crashes
Yes, but what that kid did is nothing like this.

All this would've been is him buying a ton of calls and shares to beat back the bears.

That's totally legal.
He’s probably at home cranking it

I honestly believe that if he had just been a guy with a position, and not posted on wsb, none of this would have happened (including cohen's interest / investment).

I don't think anyone here gets arrested or anything for GME stuff, but it is very obvious to people not participating that there is fomenting / manipulation out the ass going on.

p.s. it is my understanding that reddit has been contacted by federal investigators in the past, and has given up the goods (ip addresses, additional metadata, etc. etc.) but please verify on your own, I don't know this 100%. It was discussed during the post snowden days
nope
Read through your entire post and about 98% of the questions/follow up. I must admit I’m somewhat new to most of this as I would Imagine a lot of ppl are due to this GME topic. 

First, thanks for your post. I don’t understand all of it, but the general ideas and theories do make sense. I’m just curious as to how long you’ve been doing this?
can confirm Schwab no longer allows margin on GME.

can't screenshot because Schwab is a legit broker, not some RH shit that crashes when you need it most.
All in on APHA
As an inexperienced trader, the build up to the big squeeze has been very stressful—despite the obvious, massive opportunity, I’m convinced I’ll find a way to cuck myself into little or no profit. I’ve seriously developed an uncontrollable and absolutely infuriating eye twitch from thinking about it.

I’ve read god knows how many $GME posts over the past week and none of them provided the kind of cathartic confirmation bias you’ve just given me. Because, whence the squeeze hath been squozzed, this will still be a great company, with great leadership and a bright future and that’s something I want to be a part of.

If you're bad at thinking, try reading things that smarter people have thought of.

1. Cross-platform downloads. That's right, it can be downloaded and played on PC and consoles for one cost.

2. Money back on digital "returns" means less of a cost commitment than literally any other download service.

3. Physical stores switching to PC-building stores, which opens up custom builds to the majority of people who are too dumb and/or lazy to build one themselves.

Microsoft just agreed to give GME a percentage of *all* downloads from the Microsoft store. Do you really think your 30 seconds of "thought" is smarter than all of Microsoft's management? GME is going to be the comeback of the decade, and everyone knows it except for Melvin and people like you.
A computer simulation predicts that the Spike protein can bind to the ACE2 receptor better, potentially allowing the strain to infect cells easier. These mutations can also change the shape of the spike protein, which could potentially cause our antibodies and vaccine produced antibodies to not recognize the virus or destroy it.

But what they really need to do is take the actual spike protein and compare it’s binding affinity to other spike proteins we know about. Not talk about computer simulations to drum up hype.

If it’s that guy, his firm forced him to as it was getting too big of % from their portfolio. That’s why he sold like 90% of it just before the squeeze at $20. I’m sure he wasn’t happy about that - had he waited one more day...

They sell digital codes for games to the native console app store. That's not the same as being the platform where you see 30%+ cuts (Steam, Google Play, etc). If the price at Gamestop is the same as buying directly on the console there really isn't much of a benefit to do so unless you have something like gift cards to burn. Nintendo ultimately likes this strategy right now because it helps accelerate Gamestop's cash cow in used and preowned games. Would Nintendo rather they sell digital or physical?
Haha gme my boy

Why the fuck would you “cut losses” then immediately buy back in? You’re literally doing the opposite of cutting losses. The way to really cut losses is to buy more on the way down.

Do you happen know what % is typically covered calls? I expect a non-trivial percentage to be covered.

I agree there was a gamma squeeze component, but IMO you are overestimating it. I suppose that is weakly supported by the lower than expected dip on Friday.

Also your thesis does not explain the volume on Thursday does it?

Since I have not looked at the data I will take your word for it though :)
Jesus Christ that's one green dildo. Think it has more room to run? What's your price target?
Yeah but if it's Thursday and you sell puts expiring tommorow at $1 higher than current price, it's not that big of a deal unless ur trading something volatile.
Do u really want me to pull the dates. It’s a fact that after these earnings the stock price went down a bit. I’m still very bullish on this stock and am still gonna hold 30 calls for the 19th but I’m just mentioning something that people should be aware of

Thanks, yeah I hadn’t fully repositioned to capture the move fully, closed a hedge at a loss and swung into some nicely paying off debit call spreads for July, it was a great week but being dumb and not adjusting would’ve been more profitable. Took me a day or two to fully appreciate what Ryan’s appointment means for the price. This will continue to get bids. Dips will be bought, even if we see high $20s there’s a higher multiple now given we know more and more revenue is going to be shifted to e-commerce. It’s simply a matter of time and people seeing the results before more gets priced in. The short interest will lend to more strange fits and starts along the way, IMO.
I look back on my time bag holding that shit with pure disgust. Bought at $31, continue to buy down till eventually had $24 CPS with 40k invested. 

The day I sold and realized my 7k loss was one of my best trading days ever! I’ve seen tremendous growth, GTFO of RKT now. I promise you won’t regret it

There Acai Bowls and Mexican Street Corn are to die for.  I average 3 Acai bowls a day and one MSC for a WFH lunch.   I also have 29,000 shares, I started accumulating the day FMCI announced who they would be bringing public.   Their growth is phenomenal and that is mostly from their private label business (Trader Joes Acai Bowls and Mexican Street Corn is made by TC).   The branded business will be the engine that gets the top line growth to take off like a rocket.   One of their exciting new products I have not yet tried is their Breakfast Bowl.  Cage free eggs and plant based sausage for a breakfast entree.   Their expansion in 2021 will be into outlets outside of Sam's, Costco, Walmart and Target.  BTW, try and get any products from Walmart on thursdays or later in the week.  Walmart stocks on Tuesday and by Thursday the weeks stock is gone for the MSC and the Cauliflower Cheese Pizza and the Farmer's Market Ratatouille (which I add a cut up hot link sausage to).   Right now Sam's Club has the most products and the best stocking plan.   Try it, you will love it.
I like that idea a lot.  I know building a PC can be daunting for people who aren't very DIY, but this would satisfy them and also be a great place to learn more about the different build components.  I definitely think they'd have to have a regional distribution center because their stores are way too small to physically hold all that inventory.  But if you can offer a gaming PC that's built and either delivered to your door or you pick it up at your local GME store in a short time frame, I think they have a winner. 

I went through Cyberpower PC on my latest rig and it took about 5 weeks from order to receiving my gaming PC.  If they can beat that time window they can absolutely start taking market share away from those other companies who build PCs.

The only point you need:

A digital download of Cyberpunk was $60. A physical copy for PC with the OST officially printed, with stickers, box art, a physical map and a necklace of Samurai’s logo was $60.

Who got the better value?
yeah maybe the sub got it confused? BBBY actually has high short interest, so there is a chance it could theoretically moon (dunno what the odds are), but ya maybe the sub known for its retardation was actually retarded
I'm not sure you know what know what those some of those words mean

When do we start talking about XBC here?
Great post. I’m in on Feb 32c and March 35c. Hoping their earnings report is great and it really gets the squeeze going.
This is incredibly well done! I’m having trouble understanding what you mean that very ITM calls are extremely squeezable. 

I have an April 16th 20c, if I were to sell it on the open market that would cause 100 shares to be put into the market lowering the price because supply went up. But if I were to immediate buy the stock with my newly acquired money, the effect cancels out. Am I understanding that correctly? Is that where a squeeze could come? 

Would the same thing happen if I were to exercise the call? 

Thanks for the write up and any help you can give!
I sell at a loss when I get tired of waiting for them to go up. And want to move it to something else I think will move. Always need something to file under capital gains losses.

I think memberships are key. Not sure if that’s in their plan, but it could potentially play a huge role in how they incentivize people to buy.

to post in daily threads you should need to post proof of at least 1 GME share

Yeah this just got me thinking after reading the comments and looking at some of the shit they recommend. All of their bullshit etfs have had like 3 years of gains in a year in 2020? And they would rather buy that right now than like me, doing a teeny bit of DD and beating their yearly returns in 11 trading days. If you're going to buy spy that's fine but don't put any effort into it. Fuck.

Thank you for your post and responses.  You're a big asset to this place.  You're reasonable, rational, easy to understand, and seemingly mature.  

I have a question -- Does this rule mean shorters could keep the price at the COB market price?  I mean couldn't they simply short over and over as the price goes up, effectively stomping out any chance of a run up despite the rule?  The rule as you said seems to prevent simply shorting the downturns, but not the upticks.  Is this correct?

Talk to your local hospital or clinic; the vaccine expires within 6 hours of being opened so instead of wasting it, if they have extra doses and no one around to get it, they're giving the doses to people who sign up for them. You get a call and you have 2 hours to show up and you can get it even if you don't qualify yet
I’m starting to leg into a long position. And of course it ran 5% after I started legging in. I think they have huuuuge potential over the next few years.
Mostly luck i bought the 1/15 calls after the price went below 20 ended up losing money fast as it dropped to like 17ish, but held out. Guess that saying is true time in the market is better than timing it.

Yeah, buffet dumped WFC mostly because it’s a bank and he doesn’t like banks very much. RKT is merely an originator, not a loan holder. Their mortgages get sold off to banks like WFC and JPM mostly. My main thesis around RKT is that they’ll become involved in auto financing soon as well. They’ve done a pilot program with Vroom last year and my understanding is the results were stellar. I suppose  news along those lines could create a pop in the stock price, but I wouldn’t expect wonders really. Currently holding 2/19 20c.

I used to build my own computer. Like 20 years ago. It is really fun.   


My favorite thing was back then (maybe now still, I dunno) you could buy a cheap Intel chip and get a motherboard that allowed for overclocking and you could basically get the incredibly expensive, top of the line Intel CPU performance out of the really chip CPU and save a bundle. Typically, tho, building your own PC was far more expensive than buying something off the shelf unless you found a good cheap place for the parts.

Another bull case is that sideways churn hurts bears way more than bulls with the interest they're paying. If it goes up, bears lose. If it goes sideways, bears lose. If it goes down and some bears cover, it goes back up and rest of bears lose.

Bears right now are rats on a sinking (rising) ship. As soon as any news comes out that GME is on a turnaround they will eat each other alive to get out.
I pick a percentage that would be an acceptable gain and then set a limit sell when it hits as a safety net.

If you think Sony or Nintendo are going to willingly open up their consoles to a third party app store... I don't know what to say to you. Now, if there is some legislation/court cases that force this then I can see where you are coming from but ultimately I don't see cross-platform licenses becoming the norm so I don't see the need to have all of my games under one account for different platforms. Microsoft has benefit with doing it for Xbox/Windows, but Nintendo and Sony do not.

The problem is buying share is limited and shorting share unlimited by those short sellers. Kind of like gamblers paying in casino. Casino has fake chips and we are playing the real money. Who will have the upper hand as I am just thinking ? Margin requirement restrict margin for buying GME shares but will this have the same treatments for short sellers. I am not sure whether I get it right.

That’s why I’m bald deep in PLTR. 

IMO today’s defense is vastly different from yesterday’s. Because so much of our world exists on the internet, a company such as PLTR eith it’s technical ability to collate various data sources in one UI will be how factions are snuffed out. 

IMO if PLTR was contracted with US Govt leading up to this there would have been massive intel showing what was brewing in the pipeline prior to Jan 6th events of that awful day.
He played bad in their previous 2 games against NO this season but he’s just different in the playoffs. For +1000 it’s a good bet I think lol

They could at any time, and that would alleviate the pressure on the shorts and the MMs to finding shares. Margin requirements will go down, short interest rate will go down. Very bearish. What prevents them from offering, is that they know they can squeeze more money of out it, and they're not desperate for cash. They've been planning this for too long to just take the money and run now, there's too much upside to grab.

Sounds Bullish AF. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I just bought in.  Think it’s gonna run up
1) Nope. There is likely a high short interest for GME (100%+), as in a high short % of float. Has nothing to do with short shares available to float.
2) Do you not see the parentheses? To add some numbers: an absolute minimum of 4,183,137 fails-to-deliver shares since Nov 16th. An average fails-to-deliver outstanding value of $10,739,658 on trading days in December.
3) You're right about the margin requirements, that's my mistake. But the fees do go up in relation to availability of shares.
With Ryan Cohen on board I think it gets to $100a share by next year personally. With a squeeze, I have no idea. 420.69 would be fantastic, would make me a millionaire.
Cool. That will make it more volatile when the mods sell you it and have to hedge.

They have to signal it ahead of time they can't just do it tomorrow. There are rules. They have to do it at big shareholder meetings. Right now they have in place the ability to create 100 million dollars in shares, which is nothing. They have stated that this is just in case, and they have no plans to dilute the stock.  

Beyond that it would be a terrible move. They are fighting the "this company is about to go bankrupt" narrative. If they were to dilute the share price, that is something bankrupting companies do. They need to project strength and they know it.

Halo 3 was the shit.
lol shorts will just keep on paying interest is your view. 

you prob finance everything.
Surely was some momo fomo on Wednesday I agree. But it was definitely gamma squeeze with the option structure there.

Prior to Tuesday there was a huge wall of 25/30 strike calls that probably were almost entirely unhedged, and 20 was moderately hedged. That in turn swept upwards causing buying probably 10-15m shares based on change of total delta just from this week, then more on longer dates. That’s just the calls. It also obliterated short put positioning. Put that to they’re and it’s easily 1/3+ of outstanding shares to hedge. And don’t forget those 5.4m in the money Melvin capital puts that got swept through. That is a direct buy of 5.2m or so shares from start of week to Friday.
for gme do you guys sell at peaks and re-enter during dips? or just hold

I don’t think
We have GME stocks but they are keep shorting using unlimited naked short and try to push GME down. I am not sure whether margin call would stop those short sellers from doing that but it certainly stop us from buying more shares from margin call. Who’s has the upper hand on this ?

Right on man.  This should be the new focus.  Find every big short and pumping all our new gains in. Everytime we win we are bigger and can pump more money in.  Hedge Funds are f*cked.

I actually think this is what happened to Tsla.  As each bet paid off the winners had more money to dump into the next bet.  Became a wave that MM had to recognize on Delta hedging the calls.

Only "so far." I think PLTR is a great long play for 2021 and beyond. We're just that far ahead... The market will eventually catch up.
I saw someone posting realistic figures that put WSB in the ~6% of total shares range. = ~4M range

Guys, the only decent bull case right now is the short squeeze continuing.

News and performance of the company don't matter if you are buying now, it's purely technical.

If you wait for that bubble to pop a bit and come in after the dust settles in this thesis, I'm with you on it.

All this to say GME 420C 01/29/2021.
His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy

He got PLTR on margin already, mom's spaghetti
Am I underestimating the amount of capital in this sub? I thought it was broke fucks only.

Itm calls sort of squeeze because most people here eventually sell them and roll, but buy new positions that are total less hedged shares. That causes an implicit squeeze-like effect.

I don’t know which brokers did other than Schwaab and TDA.

good fundamental play, dont know why everyone is screaming its gonna moon next week

fairly sure someone just said its gonna moon and then everybody fomoing from gme just piled in
Must disagree with your 1/3rd figure. Options sellers/dealers normally hedge by buying shares = current delta don't they? So there will be OTM with delta 0.69 for eg, which when it suddenly goes ITM  in one day will not result in a buy of 100, but 31. The 69 buy would have already been priced in.

You also seem to be completely ignoring the FOMO too. The volume on Wednesday was 144M. No way there weren't new longs piling on.

If you’re all in on GME sub $20 would you buy more GME or put the rest of capital into BB?

Ryan Cohen bought around 1.2 million shares around last December at around 4.x. So he makes 9 x already. He is robust to make growth company like chewy from 3 employee to what it is now. So many expect that he can do the same for gme as well.
What would the price have to be at 2% of his total capital? That’s when they might start to feel the distress? And what % is it at now?

Shit that is good to know. This year will probably put me in that bracket -and I was planning to take those deductions. #poorpeopleproblems
Just wow. Congratulations and hope you get to enjoy all of it !
Next report comes out in ten days, It'll be interesting  either Ortex's estimates are way wrong, and that public comments from S3 that shorts haven't covered and that price action was retail hysteria was all a lie, but IDK.
Motherfucker was supposedly mailed on the 6th. I practically live across the street from the damn Treasury. 

No fucking joy. What the shit, USPS? I could have *walked* from my house to the Treasury and back 20 times over already.
Not 0% at all. Would say 50%. Many Solar ETFs went up over 200% last year with Trump. You don't think with all three branches being Dems and the environment being a priority that over the year it can't go over 300%?
So $300 x 2 = $600 share price? Buying more shares 🚀🚀🚀
Can you explain why ITM calls are squeezable?  Or did you just mean short term ITM calls?  My April calls are so deep ITM I can't see any situation where I'd been pressured to sell them.  

Also, you think another 80% increase in share prices going into Friday is a bearish sign? So if this trades sideways a week until Thursday and shoots up 80% the last hour it'll be the same as it walking up to 80% Tues, Wed, and Thursday?

Also, you believe all brokers increased margin requirements?  I'm on Robinhood, how do I check?  Because if it was increased, I didn't noticed.

Fuck it. 
Let's hit $5,000.
Do you think it’ll go up this Tuesday? I bought 35 shares
The upward pressure is the accruing interest that short holders are paying out. We don’t lose nearly as much just holding shares.
Also Cohen releasing news on upping his stake, or any new management news can easily be a catalyst.
Would be perfect time to do it also.
Hi it’s me, Tuesday
I think you're probably right. The whole post read very off.

It was basically slowly deconstructing every piece of hype with technical jargon we barely understand and can't rebut. 


What I do know is that he claims a short squeeze happened, but that's not possible since there are more shorts now then ever before.
To confirm my bias and my Roth holdings, I’ll tell you to “get fucked” good sir!

Deep down, however, I know you’re right 🥴
Looking at some more 1/29 calls, well see what they actually cost Tuesday.
when, if ever, do you think we'll see another -5%
[deleted]
That’s what they do.
You might be beating the dead horse at this point.  If the guys who bought all the shares start selling you’ll be hurting.

It costs money to hold stock in ETFs. SPDR ETFs aren’t cheap
You know he threw a few incompletions on purpose to get to 69%
So now that this GME short squeeze is publicized and somewhat started, what’s stopping big money to start getting involved to buy some stocks here to cash out at squeeze levels?

What are you planning to do with all that money?
So my plan is some extra strength chart staring on Tuesday and Wednesday. If it squeezes, I hope I sell the top. 

And then I have a stupid amount of money and... I dunno, I'll buy some PLTR? Wait a week and buy a GME LEAP? Itll probably still be stupid volatile, though. 

Maybe I'll just copy u/deepfuckingvalue again.

Can anyone explain to me like I'm a autistic 5 year old why Melvin and other institutional short sellers can't see this coming and do something to avoid the shit show that is coming their way?

I see all the WSB vs Melvin memes and I really do feel like David fighting Goliath here, but I also can't help but feel like they know what's happening and will do whatever shady shit they can to stop it?

Can't they buy / borrow from other institutional share holders, off the exchanges, to cover their shorts?

A lot, actually. WSB is usually right, but timing can be way off. I've seen TSLA, GME, PLTR, BB, BBBY, MT, NVDA, AMD, MSFT, F, GE, etc. All with gains and losses,  but mostly through options. Miss time it, and you're fkd. Buy shares an you'll usually win, but with options you'll fly or fall.
but FR, if ur going long on a stock you want ur cost avg to be as low as possible so that it can compound faster, once u pass that 5x, the gains just get insane. 

for ex

I think naked share means the short sellers pull the shares out of thin air and sell it without borrowing them, and doesn’t change my calculation? To simplify my calculation, some entity A owns all 69m GME shares, Melvin came in and said I’m shorting GME, and sell 75m shares to entity B, now Melvin has -75m shares, A has 69m, B has 75m. Does this make sense?
I can’t wait for PLTR demo day. No one knows what the fuck they do but just know it’s been a meme stock. Demo day will happen and people will put 2 and 2 together. 🚀

There already is competition in this space. Like another poster said once Palantir gets its claws in you you're on the PLTR ride for the rest of your life.  This market is literally driven by boomer upper/middle managers who want to invest in "data" .  This worked for Tableau after their 2016 collapse.  Palantir is like Tableau but with a technical consulting wing and an already established base of government contracts.  

Mid-term they at worst move sideways. Long term it depends on future product lines.  I can easily see them challenging Salesforce's crusty ass CRM or acquiring a smaller "data" startup and bringing it into their offering.
ICLN is the way
I think its Blow but I havent seen it in years
This. Melvin shills keep saying oh it's only 0.27%. Yes, that's the cost to open the short. But the losses are unlimited. We could kill Melvin or at least take their tendies.

Thank you for the confirmation bias that’s exactly what I was looking for haha but obviously the coming week could bring anything but is there a rule of thumb on selling x days prior to expiration?
Ok. Why exactly are you suggesting that this last week's puts were all the puts they had on GME and thus can no longer be squeezed? What is the evidence?

Are you serious, I am bag holding 130k profits right now. People are preaching it because this is a once in a lifetime trade. I'm getting rich whether a single person on WSB buys a share.  

  The annoyance is people acting like they are part of it buying calls. They might get rich along with the share holders, but they didn't actually do anything to increase the share price.

I keep telling people, there's a lot of noise here, but when you find technical info, verify before you trust, it's kind of a backwards version of a phrase we use in shift work "Trust, but verify."

Tomorrow is...Tuesday??
I also called the top low. Had 100 or so calls expiring on 1/15 and I started trimming after the pop on Wednesday at around $32 going up to $37 or so. Sold 85 contracts on Wednesday. Sold another 25 on Thursday including dipping into some deep ITM 4/16 contracts. Missed out on $70K or so from calling the top early but that's the timing game. 

Still have contracts and shares representing close to your position. 50/50 on where we end up in the next week. I've also set a soft target price in my head where I'll close 130 contracts and look to re-enter at a later point. After next week, no idea how it will play out either until March or so. I hear that RC will likely reveal the strategy at the next earnings call, but it's still tentative.
are you even making sense rn? I have feb 19 puts and tsla WILL hit 700 by then
Lol okay man. It’ll probably double this year. Good luck on 100% gains if you can get that.
Creepy af.  BAN

It's okay guys. Number 2 will win it for Baltimore 🤣🤣😭😭
They can take months or longer (years) to fully flesh out before reaching bottom.

If I buy the dip, I'm sure going to be doing it in small chunks slowly simply because I (and everyone else) won't know where the bottom is until its all history.
I have $5c BB leaps, I’m prepared for the best.

Because look how well the SP stayed stable despite the offloading of all their shares
You had me in the first half
Why would I be salty? I never even used the word done, so not sure what you’re quoting. I’m not buying in when it’s already hyped up this high, there are plenty of other ventures.
well, I ddid call the top on TSLA. Wait... dont tell me you had calls on that too XD
From personal experience, when I build a PC, I go ham and future proof that baby for at least 5 years. I've seen people comparing rigs to phones, but i disagree. It all comes down to if my PC can play the newest fallout, COD, Cyberpunk, etc. on max settings or not.
I’m holding TRLY and APHA shares, selling CSPs. Both have been great. I’m very happy the sector as a whole is really doing well, I have... high hopes for the future.
Wow I just looked it up that’s not that bad
Anymore news about the infastructure package yet?

He is now free to buy up to 19.9% of the company which I think is very likely. 🚀🚀🚀
We should blast Ryan Cohen with “ideas” along these same lines in hopes he’ll half-confirm them or something so we can share that on Twitter.

If the Bills finish it off tonight and the Browns pull off a miracle tomorrow I think we’ll be in for an insane 2021
I read that Melvin has about 0.27% of his funds capital in GME shorts, with a cost basis of about $8. 

If we push to $420.69, he will have lost about 15% of his fund’s **total** capital, off of a single minuscule position. 

You hate to see it, folks.
Anyone else got a bad feelin bout next week?

!RemindMe 1 day
I was thinking about buying 100 shares or so on BB and then just watching it before possibly buying more
Have they traded at all yet?
Snow puts. This was as of Jan 7 when another 60~% was added to their float and the fking stock was moving up. Biggest horseshit ever. 

I was watching level two data and anytime there would be a large sale at market and a red candle would come up, a mysterious order of 15k would be bought and boom back to green.
Who tf are you?
How do you find where their current assets are? I see their quarterly report from September which was a few months ago
how’s like 3 yrs ago lol?
So is it a wash and just more ammo for the squeeze? Some DD posts seemed to suggest otherwise.
I am long.  I have 4200 shares i wrote covered calls on so I do hope it dips next week before it goes to the moon just under $30, I will pay my dumb tax and then back over $40.

I also have about 40 April 15 $15C.

Good luck man, you never know.

I was seriously down all Thursday after going WSB on FD’s. I was kicking myself for not selling at the peak early AM.

Then on Friday, Cathy rolls up in her unmarked van and says “get in, we’re doing Moon stuff” and low and behold I finally come close to breaking even after my fling with the SLV surfers over the Summer. Up 20% in one day. 

But yeah, you do you amigo. Friday was great because Thursday sucked so bad.

This is kinda where I'm at now after reading everyone's comments. I'm not really sure what my target is (or should be) or a good strategy for identifying the top of the squeeze, but I'm not above cashing my investment out at some point.   

I really just invested because of my trust in Cohen.
Yeah bro. This is literally the first time when a pump makes sense. It seems ridiculous but it's actually real. Haters are always going to hate but they are really just salty because they didn't buy a month ago and they are too pussy to buy now.

Don’t forget Trevor and Melvin.


Edit: Fuck Bob Swan from the bottom of my heart.
you can make shares basically out of thin air -- it can be done. Saw a video where Jimmy Chanos explained that basically # of short shares can theoretically be 10x number of shares for 1,000% short float at max

I’ve read tons of GME write ups and most of them have a misunderstanding of financial concepts or (in my opinion) a misinterpretation of data.  I just wanted to reply to you to say I think you did a great job on this, I agree with you 100% and thank you for the post! 🍻
What do you mean
I read it. Didnt understand most of it. Ill be honest, I dont even know what the greeks are. But I did at least try to understand it which makes me feel even more retarded. At this point, im not sure if thats a good or bad thing.

Because I know I am retarded, im still sticking to shares. My sisters husband is trying to teach me about spreads (His favorite one is the Iron Condor) and risk management, but even that still requires too much thinking on my part. Buy and flatten is what ill stick to. Seems to be working out so far.

He asked where I get most of my information. I said WSB. He laughed, shed an internal tear. Probably called me retarded in his mind. Then told me he doesnt risk more than 1% of his account per trade. Now hes waiting for me to blow out my account.

My response was. "The only thing doing blowing here will be the Hookers. Blowjobs and cocaine. Doubling down!" 

And thats when they kicked me out of the table during Christmas dinner.
Better not tell you now
Why not both?!
Not the TSX where the stock also trades.
My understanding is every time you sell, you are providing shares to Melvin etc to cover their shorts. This is bad as the more they are able to cover, the less the price will increase (iow decreases demand and likelihood of short squeeze). Best to hold, buy more on dips. Go into this with expectation that spike may not happen for a few weeks, but if you hold strong, you are likely to be handsomely rewarded.
safety!!!

The prejudice "actions have consequences," when it comes to monetary policy, seems to be one of the most empirically unsupported ideas out there in recent memory. Anyone alive in the 2010's remembers all the stupid "but Greece" arguments for why we had to cut spending and/or pull back the Fed. And printing more currency turned out to be the right idea every time.
They're sitting on 1.2b in cash, thanks to Altria (Marlboro). Not only should they sky rocket based on positive news, they are sitting on a mountain of cash to purchase the prettiest assets as new reform takes place.

They've been "waiting this out" for months already and the position is only getting worse, you can literally see it in the tape.  At some point, even if they don't "have" to close the position from a margin standpoint, they will.

For any new people to BB, I am bullish BB, but feel you should know a little more before yoloing your life savings into this stock.

This is a LONG hold. This is not a squeeze scenario that will pop how GME did. If you're looking for the next GME, you need to do some research and realize that may be a long time coming.

In the tiniest of oversimplified explanations, BB looks good on paper right now because of one time patent sales and licensing profits they realize to offset some pretty heavy operation expenses. BB is in a transitionary period since it was, and still is seen this way, a hardware company. Now as a software company, they bought a start-up in Cylance 2 years ago and have now merged their software with Cylance to create Cyber Suite and are getting some sweet contracts. They have partnered with Amazon's AWS to help them develop IVY which is the smart software for vehicles that won't see any revenue till mid 2022 at the earliest. They also have QNX which is actually a stronghold of theirs right now currently generating revenue that can see some great growth as they are in roughly 60% of the EV market. HOWEVER......THIS IS A LONG HOLD. If you're looking for some FD's, fuk outta ere because you'll most likely lose your money. Otherwise, it may get a little volatile right now as we've seen over the last couple of weeks due to the dampening from Q3 earnings and now the rise due to all the presentations. These presentations are all reiterating what I stated above, but for whatever reason, you tards think this means rockets now.

Anywho, be smart with your money. Still a good investment, but a long term investment.

Edit to let you know I hold 400 shares at 7.50 and $5 calls at $4 a pop for 2023. I personally am thinking about selling my shares and just going deeper into these 2023 calls as those babies will print hard even at these current prices. Just need patience.
\>Maintaining your wealth

Answered your own question there. What is your definition of wealth when you have a billion? How would it change once you enter that class? It's easy falling into the trap of becoming conceited when you've aimed to achieve and succeeded at the thing that everyone in the world views as the pinnacle. At that point, when you have people groveling near you and a sensible opinion comes around that doesn't lick your boots, your perception will have been warped by a toxic environment and you might be hostile or ambivalent to giving that opinion any weight. Billionaires don't involve themselves with significantly less wealthy people all that often for a lot of reasons that are more than likely out of their control.
Every. share. counts. Cannot stress this enough.

Agreed - I get pissed when I see this.  He's creating some narrative like we're somehow 1.8 million people collectively pooling our money together to try to crush positions on the market based on no fundamentals or catalysts or anything.  The GME DD that's been going on for the past 3-4 months (and frankly even longer, there was some good stuff in May of last year as well) has been top notch.  Hard to not get into a position when you can't argue with the bull case.

I guess I didnt clarify. I don't have much as far as volume goes. I got 15 shares @ 17, sold at 34, and bought back in with like 300$ extra cash I had and ended up with like \~23 shares. I guess I Should  just held my other buy at 17, and bought MORE at 34? That way it at least keeps my average down I'm guessing?  Sorry again, broke retard here only been trading 3 weeks. I'll be buying more GME Tuesday and keep this clown fiesta of a start I have on my portfolio going, probably what I should have done in the first place.  Lesson learned... Right guys?

Hi thank you for posting this.  A good chunk of this went over my head but I always love a good learning opportunity and as much as I love the jokes here, it’s always nice to get a serious DD post.
What about the "house" and location?
Totally, I'm surprised at how good it is so far. Never watched it when I was younger so I wasn't sure if it was worth starting.
My hands are getting shakey with all this gay bear talk
wtf
There's a lot of dumb rocket emojis around and posts with no info in them, but pltr isn't over, it hasn't even started.

People in here trying to get rich quick lose interest when something doesn't gain 100% in a day but that doesn't mean shit.
The exit strategy is simple, they increase the margin requirements to 100%, open up new shorts, bring the price down, force the majority of retail to be wiped out and get margin called and then buy their shares at cents on the dollar.
Bro
Maybe because he’s your friend, he trusts you, and didn’t see you’re a grimey piece of shit

  
> Have you seen the dd from u/jeffamazon

Yeah, I've read/followed any GME posts here that were on the front pages of WSB. There were always some things in his DD that never made sense to me. I decided to re-read part 1 and this stuck out to me (likely again):  
> They can talk about how $GME is going to be Blockbustered. Only one problem - GME’s Netflix… is GME itself.  
  
That doesn't make sense. GME's Netflix are Steam, Epic store, Origin, Play store, etc. I can say with almost certainty that Gamestop is not going to make substantial headway into digital game delivery.  They've taken too long to come to market (and failed with an acquisition in the past) for this. The only way they get into this market is with partnerships like revenue sharing with MSFT (my understanding is this is not unique to GME though, and all other retailers get access to it).  
  
Don't get me wrong I did end up buying GME shares 2 weeks ago on the dip (at a higher price than I sold back in 2018! I think I did a buy at like $12.60 and sold at $15.70 3 months later).
So everybody apparently needs to read up on delta hedging. Go read anything uberkikz11 or the other OGs posts they are very informative. Some of us have just had plans in motion for a while.

How’s the non-weed life been?
If you buy options, whoever writes those options is usually buying those shares to tentatively hold for you, but you get 10x the leverage. If they’re writing naked calls, they’re exponentially more fucked on margin requirements. Anyone writing naked calls at this point is all in on whaetever hand they’re dealt. 

Not utilizing leverage at this point seems to be what those under the knife would prefer.

Why not tho?  It’s not that uncommon in the industry actually. Hell Burry everyone’s profit is mostly GME forever
Yeah maybe. I don’t know if companies are waiting to see if it works for Fubo before doing it themselves, it’s more the whole “not being federally legal” thing holding them back. 

They will have the first mover advantage, but it’s going to be a very slim/short advantage before there’s plenty of other options in the space. It will need to be a fantastic product and user experience to maintain that edge. I personally haven’t used it or have any friends that use it, and of course the Sportsbook and integration of that is yet to happen, so I can’t speak to what the product is like. 

Somebody is going to make a ton of money in this space, and it could very well end up being Fubo if the company is run well and has a good marketing team. So just for that potential I’ll probably open a position to go along with my dkng and penn, especially if it dips a little more!

GME play is a bet on a once in a lifetime squeeze and is up 180% last week 

BB play is a business pivot and new contracts + positive news and is up 22.76% in a week 

BB sounds better to me but who knows
How do you see such thing?
imagine guh
Same here man, I'm nowhere near caught up. Around 170 episodes in right now.
Yeah I get bothered by them just laughing and being like "the only objective was to band together and squeeze shorts".  No.  I got into GME after seeing DD here, looking into it myself, and mainly my thesis was confirmed by Ryan Cohen.  When RC came in, had no idea who he was - did more research and realized GME is gonna be a great hold throughout the next couple years under his leadership.  Like, there are so many bullish catalysts that the stock has merit on its own fundamentally.  The fact that it's so ridiculously sold short is a bonus as it shows market sentiment hasn't shifted.  It's started to now, and they think this is just luck on WSB's part.  We were just early and saw this before most of the market.
There's an Indian billionaire who just doubled down on stocks recently. He now holds just under 20% of the company, he's been trying to purchase the company for cheap but was recently stopped because of shareholders reporting this to the SEC. He's also on the board of directors aka this guy know BB is  🚀🚀🚀 $$$$ 🚀🚀🚀 , tried to fucking snipe the whole company but was stopped because it was against the rest of the shareholders' interests. BB is finally ramping up.. took them a while and now they are getting into a position to truly monetize their QNX OS + other plays.

I know these movements will shake some paper handers. I told a buddy at work to buy shares and he did. Then he went down 40 bucks and sold. The paperest of handses. I plan to increase my position whenever the stock dips below my average from shorting action. I have kept good cash on hand in order to do so. I am greatly looking forward to the coming weeks.
Wait so did he make it out or was it all a dream? Asking this because I already know that BB and GME are going 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎🤚🏼💎

Needless to say, that relationship didn't last long and I found a love for making tendies or losing everything in the pursuit of making tendies.

Damn.  Calls on your school.
Short squeezes don't happen over the course of months, so $4 or whatever their summer low is would be a lousy benchmark. GME has been stable around $20 since their last earnings, and we don't even know if this run up to $30+ was short covering or people going long with RC and friends taking over the board and kicking out the lousy management.

And even if it was short covering, we don't even know what percentage of shorts covered, and how many are still deeply underwater.

See C, BLK, and WFC. Banks were rising purely off momentum. Earnings weren’t that great and it showed that the core businesses that aren’t cyclical are in decline. Bank stock valuations are more grounded to fundamentals so naturally they should decline to their true price. I think BAC is close to $26 a share but with the call volumes I doubt it will reach. $30 is where it’s support is
same is said for apple.
When you learn what NOT to do, you’re still learning something.

I entered PTON 100@$88 and sold @$115, now @$157. I entered LMND 100@$91 and sold  @$125, within a week it hit $181. Gains are gains but that taught me to trust my gut more. PLTR was such a roller coaster that I didn’t touch GME other than a few shares. I’ve been long BB, this is a game changer for me.

I’m assuming he just held until expiration, sold the shares at $20, and made a profit. Obviously, not the profit he would have made if he just held the shares. But no moron is going to sell calls at a lower strike than what he paid for the shares, so he still sold higher than he bought in

Yes, If the STAKEholders equal the SHAREholders. Just cause Melvin has a share, doesn't mean they have a stake in the company. The future for GME under Cohen is so bright, I gotta put on some shades 😎
I read a report that 34% of TWTR’s users are Trumpers, and 71% of the content on TWTR the past 4 years are Trump-related.

Meaning they shot themselves in the dick.

Especially with how volatile the stock is right now, selling naked calls is one of the easiest ways to get fucked beyond belief.

Yeah doesn't it just basically come down to the question of, can you use that money to beat the 2-3% mortgage interest rate? If yes, then obviously dumping all that money into the house and having no bills is worse than paying bills and earning back more with the extra capital.
Seems like the concern is covered calls being able to liquidate those shares if there’s no performance. But if they’re covering the calls, they’re buying shares. They’re also doing it with 10x the buying power they’d get if just buying shares. They’re incentivizing 10x the length on shares. 

If they’re writing naked calls amid a short/gamma squeeze, then good lord.
What’s a trading site that lets you loan shares to be shorted? I’ve had gme for a while and I could’ve been making a killing...
I have looked Melvin Capital 13F and they are shorting GME with $15 puts July, 2021.

Their maximum loss would be only 100% if the price until July 2021 remains above $15 and put options expire worthless. If the price drops to $15 with this IV they would probably make money even if it doesnt go under $15.

Theres no short squeeze in put options and since they can simply let them expire worthless why is everyone expecting short squeeze?
Don't you know in 2020/21 offerings are suddenly bullish now? Shit i remember when offerings were bearish.. now they're bullish because "tHe coMpAnY NoW hAs MoRe CaSh tO inVeSt iN tHe FuTurE!! hurr durr"

Yes it is.. The last 10 years has shown us that we deal terribly just with refugee crises and resource shortages which will be dwarfed by the ones climate change will produce.

We are in for a very tough time within the next century. The breakdown of the environment is no joke, and a reasonable expectation of 16m sea level rises will be catastrophic. That’s our best case scenario right now.

Papa Cohen ain't buying new shares at this price. I still hope he can make some anouncement about the future of the company that will act as a catalyst. But he bought the shares at like 16, he didn't buy over 20. Like hell he is buying at 30+ unfortunately.
Someone posted in here in December about unusual option activity for 1/15 7.50C, significant volume. I bought 5 for pretty cheap. BB proceeded to do fuck all for the next month and I thought it was a done deal, then bam one day before expiry it blasts off. So yeah, someone with deep pockets knew something at least a month ago.

But, now hear me out: why do your wives not get themselves girlfriends? I mean, can someone elaborate for a newbie like me plz? Anyways, I would like the chilli-cheese fries with extra BBQ sauce on the side. Thank.

Oh wow.

I bought 200 shares of MMNFF stock at IPO. If I cash out, I could get a spliff or two.
How do you determine what date to make your call? (am n00b)
>First some facts:

>1) There was an obscene amount of shorts of GME before it went up last week (138%+ of float). There is now still an EVEN MORE obscene amount of shorts of GME (120-170% of float as high-quality estimates).

>2) There has been over a month of likely "naked short selling." Aka, ILLEGAL market manipulation (Sells of unconfirmed shares that then end up not going through) in an attempt to further drive down price (27 days on NYSE Threshold securities list, since Dec 8th).

>3) Fees to borrow GME have gone up significantly (sitting around 30% atm) and required margins have increased at brokers (75% for Fidelity, 100% for Schwab). This means those brokers are less confident in it going down, and that there are less available shares floating around (lower volumes).

1) I think you are confusing short volume with short shares available to float.  There is alot of short day trading volume on big price action days.

2) Likely?  You have any evidence of this?

3) Brokerage firms increase margin requirements based on volatility metrics.  Has nothing to do with some analysts opinion on if am equity will go up or down.

I stopped reading after this. Dude is well-meaning but his facts are not actual facts.
How so...? The names aren’t worth knowing so I don’t know them off hand anymore
When do we buy?
All dating apps should be shut down. Buying more apple if they do it.
Sell at 23-25. Shit has been profitable af for me all month. Just manage this position closely.

LEAPs are always a solid play that gives you some leverage. Wait for the IV to drop some more. It was high after the spike. Go to marketchameleon to check it.
You don't understand I was retarded before the other retards and I have a retarded plan that has been in motion. I'm not changing my retarded plan now that the other retards have their own retarded plans. Our retardedness will coexist but my plan was based on growth without the squeeze with the console cycle.

you receive cash after its been taxed.  You are not taxed on anything in your tfsa. However, when you hold a us stock and this stock pays dividend, that div is subject to a withholding tax. This means that the company gives you 85% of the div and gives the rest to the gov. But you will not be taxed on the gains you made from selling the stock for a profit
I haven't touched LEAPs so far (only options plays I do are CCs and CSPs), when you say to sell weeklies puts against your LEAP puts you mean using that as a collateral to your sell?

eg: I get TSLA 500 1/22 and keep selling weeklies TSLA 500 (or less) and the broker will use my LEAPS as collateral instead of stocks or cash? 

If that's the case is there a way to tell my broker (before settlement) what it should be doing? I trade on RH and TOS for reference.
Let's keep the gains on the TSX then
money ain't real, time ain't real
LMAO what

If you have Fidelity, they may offer it if your portfolio  is worth at least 500K and you have to put in a minimum of 100K.

That being said, I think coinbase will a direct listing. So basically anyone can buy on open market the day it's traded. They will announce and you'll have to just wait in the morning.

Sorry about your GME shorts retard.
what are verticals
If they have a short position for more than a year wasn't the $3 share price in the summer a good point to exercise? Where they hoping it to go to $1? It continuesly went up since the summer, losing them money. I don't get why they looked on how the price increased and now exploded. Am I missing something here? Are short sells a fixed date that can't be exercised or sold sooner?
It should be a long term boom too. LTHM is the next big commodity.
'lent shares recalled' will be the catalyst

moving to milton
I've been saying this from the very beginning that GME needs to focus more on PC and am glad to hear they're looking that route.  I have the older generation of consoles, but have been almost exclusively playing on PC for the past 5 years.  PC users also tinker with their rigs too by upgrading various components so you should see recurring revenue.  It sounds like a dope idea.

Nah. You gotta sell a call above your strike.  As theta eats away on your call it’ll eat away on that one as well.  But say you sell a $3400c and it goes in the money.  You’ll stop profiting on your call once that $3400 goes in the money
This happened to me with fcell. Bought shares at $2.15 sold them at $4 now its around $20.

It’s more about where in the price range vol is going to be expressed and what price ranges are hard to cross. I’m net bearish for reasons not in this post but you could take a bullish view for other reasons.

Yep.  Gonna go back in on another one Tuesday.
I was bearish about holiday sales and warning people of what to expect. I was very accurate. I did not factor in a historic settlement like Monday’s. Which gives long term GME bulls like myself so much more upside & valuation than the current price even now represents, IMO
hahahah, the song is amazing too
Very nice
So...you were making shit up in your prior post then?
Did you rebound?

I feel like GME popped once ppl stopped talking about it. By that logic, PLTR will moon in the next two weeks

Yes it is, after I saw a few comments someone finally linked it and I was able to confirm it for myself. I don't however have that link to redistribute because I'm a fucking retard. But PLTR is going to the moon trust me on that.
Maybe I’m retarded. I think they’ve just left the U.K. for good. 😭 Can’t even shop online now. Oh well, maybe if this squeeze happens I can profit to reopen a U.K. store.

The $9B was not only for cybersecurity. That was my point, it was also modernizing their IT which PLTR will definitely be apart of.

I’m hoping gme gets me to make some real moves in a similar way this year. People like you have inspired a lot of us.
This is not good news, lots of retards fomo'd in on margin at $40 all the way down to $35, if shorts step in fucking hard they can easily bring this down to $30-$25 range and thats just normal GME price movement, it goes up like a rocket and comes down like a rock.  


More than likely a whole bunch of long positions on margin get liquidated and there are all these free shares to scoop up and cover on id say the post itself is good but as you pointed out, the retail sentiment of paper handed bitches who threw everything they had on margin and can not actually afford to fund the margin call that will come is going to be pretty epic.
I grew up in one of those homes and it got me to WSB recklessly trying to end up back there so it’s honestly not that bad

Red days for a while fellas. Look at VIX
next time you hop on a FOMO squeeze please do a little bit of research
Implied Volatility is probably the thing you experienced which is a measure of pretty much how volatile the stock is. It contributes to the price of an option as it is pricing in volatility as volatility gives higher likelihood of a big possibly favorable move. When stock moves so quickly, it's IV shoots through the roof as does the price of the option and as it tapers off, so does the price.

You should read up more on how they work before you get burned playing them cuz they can burn you hard lol it's good to get some hands on experience with some change though cuz just reading about it isn't enough. Knowing which are the best strike/exp for the type of move you're expecting is very important too. Good luck trading

They're working with Hyundai and by extension Apple as well as a recent article that Kia will be using their chassis. They have ex BMW executives on their team who know what it takes to make money mass producing autos as well as angel money from well connected Asian investors. The just announced the board and its all the right kinds of people for a company that is serious about becoming a major EV player. 

Tony Aquila has been an automotive entrepreneur for 30 years and he has proven successful as recently as 4 years ago. Their prototype is already crash tested, lowering the barriers of entry for tech companies (AAPL) to develope an EV. The skateboard chassis is a game changer for EVs because they can be literally anything. Its plug and play. Car, truck, van, whatever. This company will be reeling in profits from subscription leases, direct sales of vehicles, bulk sales of chassis to other makers and royalties from others using their tech.

It's not just another EV start up like Nio, lucid, et al. Like I said, they're the real deal, just Google it you'll find all this shit in articles from the last 2 weeks.

When Melvin did that, the dealer had to sell 5.4m shares to hedge. They bought way in the money. So was an attempt to make a price collapse. Can probably figure out when they did it in the records and see impact on price.
Cybersecurity is adversarial; someone is actively trying to hack you, and you defeat them any way you can. You could call it 'combat' if you wanted

In Data analysis, there is no adversary (except ignorance). You are trying to leverage what you know to gain greater understanding of underlying principles

&#x200B;

Now yes, there is significant overlap in skillset between these 2 fields, HOWEVER, they are still pretty fucking different. For example, I personally have done some data analysis, ive done ZERO cybersecurity
100% agree. if they want to buy for nearly 41$ (math is hard) then they have confidence it explodes.  so no. i just want to see if they would really offer that

So with the Greeks, the importance of each depends on how you’re playing it, and i feel like (key word feel) Vega feels the most arbitrary, but depends on your strategy I suppose. If you’re trying to keep it close to at the money with your orders, like I do, you’re prepared for a Vega of like 6,7 fuck it even up to 10% of the premium—that trade off comes with the relative profit security of having an atm stock. The further you get from ATM in either direction the more Vega becomes less and negligible, because you’re swinging for the fences

As a general rule, unless you’re doing some hardcore OTM YOLO shit a few percent or less ratio to premium price is ideal
What do you guys think about 50 dollar calls for Tuesday? Or just get more shares?

How? What’s the rationale behind that statement?

Makes no sense. If the same short sellers are writing naked calls their margin requirements are going to be exponentially difficult to maintain. If they’re writing covered calls, you’re buying shares.

When you can’t meet margin on naked calls, that position gets liquidated, and gamma will be through he roof. If they’re covered, they had to bid up those shares to cover, and gamma still goes through the roof.

Fancy lighting? Does this mean my new GME rig will be yeet enough to to post to R/battlestations?
Yeah I read it but them but it's still kind of confusing to understand how shorts that need to sell because of margin calls is bullish. I got in at 22 and then 17 with 700 shares but I've been averaging up this week and now hold 1037. 

If it keeps dipping I'll probably have to sell because of margin but definitely not as much as people that bought 35+.

Amazon at 3000 should be a extreme buy tho
I'm not smart enough to have an opinion about what earnings look like.

I have a small position on long dated calls. My play is that we hear amazing subscription increases because of them putting their 2021 movie catalog on the service and the price shoots up because this is a reactive, speculative market.

I went long dated because I'm often wrong and time is my hedge.

I’d love for someone, maybe u/Unlucky-Prize, to explain more about how large block option trades can impact share price. The option dealer that sold Melvin Capital their 54,000 1/15 24p had to hedge the position somehow. How do they do this and what impact would unwinding that position have on the share price?  Are all options trades hedged by the dealer with stock or other options?

Companies value is set by share price. Getting shorted to oblivion limits options for credit and other avenues for raising funds in hard times. A very healthy company can be run out of business through shorts especially when something like COVID happens. If GME didn’t have a healthy war chest in March there is a good chance they would be gone today. A company that has been on the decline for about 6 years (revenue) and whose stock is a penny stock. They would have to issue hundreds of millions of shares to raise real money and who’s going to buy them? If anything would cause a sell off. What bank would loan them money? 

While shorts don’t effect day to day operations it does make bankruptcy more likely.
If gamestop can use its data to have the right volume on releases and be branded as "never out of stock" on popular items, while successfuly avoiding warehouses full of junk, they could EASILY get my business.

Only from the most basic technical definition of “brokerage.” It’s a gambling app. That’s what it actually is. There isn’t even a number to call if your account is hacked. RH users also get the worst prices on fills because RH makes the bulk of their money front running those orders and selling order flow, to their own customers’ detriment.
I’d definitely invest in Alibaba, their technology is light years away from most companies . I’d be careful however their technology being integrated into western society could be difficult with security concerns. Also something to keep in mind is Jeff from Amazon is already copying products bought from AliExpress to undercut sellers reselling AliExpress goods, I.e. if Jeff decides to take the AliExpress route, by making and producing their own goods it could damage Alibaba when it comes to sales of physical goods.  I’m optimistic for it to come to western markets but it’s a shame their technology will likely either be blocked like huawei were or restricted.

These boomers have no idea.  Maybe they should stick to stuff they know and not video games.
It’s based on demand. The more popular to short the higher it gets

Look at like one of the banned tickets here. Or gme.
Selfish with no shares, hope your calls get eaten by theta and vega
Risky business
That is currently happening, some people are having to sell to cover margin. Been a few posts explaining it well, but longs will be effected less because they have to sell less value in shares to cover margin than shorts will have to have in value to cover.

I’m not tryna be controversial just curious but wasn’t it true that most of if not all of MLK’s speeches were written by his Jewish friend ?

Will demo day have any effect on PLTR? I’m hopeful but not convinced.
No
He was YOLO’ing GME since early 2019, long before it was cool. In fact he was a laughing stock, just take a look at his early post history. Who’s laughing now lol.

We are here to make that happen, gonna suck if you miss by just a couple days though.
Even after the squeeze the share price is going to be much higher than what it was a few months ago. Also, GameStop still has the option to do a shelf offering of $100M worth of shares. So if they do that while a squeeze is happening they could raise a good amount of capital to help fund the turnaround without causing too much dilution.
If covered and not exercised, you multiply the impact of short squeeze through gamma squeeze.
TLRY calls.. the current valuations and conversion ratio are shit for APHA.. bigtime fuckery. Even after adjustment the calls will end up being a better return long run.
First 2 years not so good, last 2 years better.
u need turnovers and bombs
Actually true though
More likely bubble pops, investors start crying and suing the brokers and everybody else, and then we get more day trade regulations
Just finished watching this
Apparently this is the DKNG sub now. Step aside GME
Markets are closed anyways.. Wish i worked monday
Tesla is at .3% HAHA might as well throw it in a savings account. I guess ill have to do some research but i dont understand how that rate is determined and why teslas is so low

Thanks so much for that! I've been so confused about that since I've started playing with options a few weeks ago.  

It seems that the most important thing for a play like gme is having the momentum behind it because I noticed when I had my 45c on Thursday even though they were out of the money I was up a bunch because there was momentum behind it but as soon as the momentum died they dropped in value in an instant

On some brokerage platforms yes, but also because if you’re margin called and can’t cover the cost of the shares purchased on margin then you can be forced to sell for a loss. If it happens to enough people it can cause the share price to decrease.  There is a high likelihood of margin calls on all things GME both on the long and short positions.

Selling TSLA and AMZN put credit spreads 3 weeks out with earnings in 2 weeks.
Fuck Melvin. Buy all the shares!
Welcome to BB sir
It's very important to understand that when Melvin does a short sale on the equity they are essentially selling non existant shares to then open market trying to drive the price down...its an expensive manipulation strategy. Also, when they sell puts, MMs need to hedge which also drives the price down.

TLDR, there is no price target. If we all put sell limit orders at 420, then that's the price target. That's the price Melvin has to pay to close their shorts.

to all of you who are thinking about selling GME, trust the process. A couple weeks ago, people bought at $22 and sold for a massive loss. Several people bought at $38 and probably sold at $32 for a massive loss. Those paper handed pussies could have been in the deep green right now, but they have no faith. Even if you bought at $42, you will be in the green soon. DIAMOND HANDS 💎

I was reading somewhere that the only way that institutions will get margin called is if we 20x in a single day. Wouldn't be margin called be bearish since you tell investors holding a shit ton of shares on a margin would have to sell?

The break even shown only matters at expiration. If he bought these when the stock was trading at 35, and GME goes up, his calls will gain value according to delta and delta will gain according to gamma. You don't need options to go ITM to flip them for a profit. If it hits 60 his gains can be pretty insane depending mainly on how soon.
He started with $45k.

Depends on if they're naked or covered calls. If covered and exercised, price could go down if a lot of people exercise the calls and then sell immediately.

Uptick rule, dropping out of ICR, the crazy run up, Ryan Cohen, and possible margin calls all in one week. Tuesday has uptick rule in effect still and I am hoping for at least some upwards pressure Tuesday from retail margin calls. Hopefully I get lucky and the big boys get margin called or decide to cover initiating the squeeze. Since i've been in on GME this is the best scenario of events I've seen yet to initiate it.
No I bought PLTR at 11 and sold at 27.  I get my kicks clowning bagholders.

Yes, someone can explain. They've explained it hundreds of times in this sub. Look up chewy.com, Ryan Cohen, the sales for the company, how much Melvin Capital is shorting GME.

I've been thinking about this for a while. Seeing it here is the confirmation bias I needed

As I've put it elsewhere:  Shares are what is required to make GME happen, everyone with options are just retards drawing in their notepads while the smart kids do the group project.

Reducing available shares on the market is what causes the squeeze.
Good DD, interested, but... Positions?

I see your point.

I don't know of a data source that tells us institutional vs. retail option investors.  But per u/unlucky-prize analysis, there's a shit ton (Thursday) of options on each side (+/- $35).  

My theory is, on there are more boomer sentiment on the puts, thus, more institutional money on that side.  On the call side, it's majority retail investors.
Don't get me wrong, there are some Joe Schmoe betting against GME, but on average Retail investors aren't as savvy and sophisticated enough to make that educated guess.  We don't have the tools, information, and resources to make educated bets like that.  Usually retail investors aren't sophisticated to play the call side as well, but this sub has put retardation all on that side.

I guess we will see on Tuesday, and as unlucky prize said, one thing is for sure....volatility.  

GLTA.  I'm in the same boat.
Just go to the SPAC sub and pretend you're here, those dorks will love it.
I will say, historically, legalization has not made things faster legislatively for most things. In fact most laws typically slow down businesses no matter the type; truthfully it's rational if you think it through: The more tape you had the more you have to cut. So what happens with legalization is stipulations and then even with mainstream adherence and acceptance there are limitations which usually complicate the enforcement. But that's just historically. I could be wrong!

Secure the bag And still have massive leverage for future gains.
I think you'll be good. maybe get out on the next run up towards earnings I've been accumulating shares around 90 and have a CSP @ 77.50 for Feb I'm not worried about getting assigned on but would happily take.
they’ll be ITM bigly

You know how institutions have the tendency to screw over retailers? I have a feeling Melvin will cover before retailers, screwing them over having them to buy back at a much higher premium.

Need TLRY to going up this week!!
Priced in. ICLN is a good buy but unlikely to be a 🚀 until we get some green new deal action.
Idk why.. shits going to get hyped whether we pump it or not, plus not like they're risky.. worse case they go back to trading at 10 bucks but probably trade at a premium to NAV either way 11-14.. or worse look at how big of a premium you pay to suck Ackman's dick with that bullshit, no deal even announced.
Yeah, it's at least an improvement mpg wise for me lol. I want to get a couple years used and just can't find many g70 online, and I live in Seattle not some tiny city

Isn't... that literally investment firms, funds, etc?

Pumping and dumping is lying or bullshitting people to get them to buy. It is actually tricking them. Asking people for help is neither of those.

I’m envisioning a bundle of things that go along with purchasing your custom built PC or parts at GameStop. Some sort of bundle with GamePass, tech support, free entry into some events or tournaments they host for a year.  Then once you do this you never shop anywhere else for the next 20 years.

Yeah, loads of brokerages reject shorts across a whole raft of equities, whether they are marginable or not.

I've never been able to short Tesla through Schwabitrade, for instance.

The shorts that matter don't use Schwab, Fidelity, Etrade, etc.

You can do that with shares. Listen, we’re all trying to get tendies here. I saw your other comments saying you pulled out when you hit 100% return. That’s fucking awesome. But what if I told you, you can hit 100% again if you buy back in right now? End the cycle of peasantry with a proper fucking YOLO

What makes you think we're going to get all the way to 60 without a catalyst? I'm hoping something announced before Tuesday at open. 

Fully possible considering how events this week unfolded. Last week I was calling people tards for buying weeklies with 30C strikes.

I got burned on buying 45C on Thursday because I held them too long but I could have easily doubled my money because we did have some momentum earlier in the day
Damn right. I’m joining them after GME is all said and done. Or else I’ll end up losing everything (again).

There's no new good news coming that isn't already known. People are talking about Biden environmental plans like they got secret information. That's all been known for MONTHS. 

Everything from here is either confirmation of what is already priced in or drops because Biden hits roadblocks and can't pull off what he said he would.
When WSB collectively says buy shares instead of calls for a ticker it should be headline news.

It would be beneficial if TLRY was trading at a premium to APHA but it isn't.. as it stands we get 83% of 2.94B at current standings, assuming you bought now all else being equal, you're buying a 3.84B market cap company (APHA) and assuming the price ratios stay the same, only getting 83% of 2.94B at the end of the day.. You instantly take a 23% haircut assuming the same ratio is maintained as far as how the market is valuing both companies going into the merger. TLRY calls are a smarter move, the APHA conversion ratio is not beneficial to APHA shareholders at all.. but i would assume market will price that in and move the valuations closer together ie higher TLRY market cap and lower APHA market cap.

That seems like very optimistic & risky price. Will be interesting to see what happens.

as a console gamer that has bought and downloaded games, I'd much rather have physical copies because buying additional disk space is annoying as fuck and if I want to play an old game I downloaded but then deleted to make room, i don't want to wait for a 1GB plus download and then patches.

Obviously as bandwith and storage capacity cost/dynamic changes, so will this - but thanks to net neutrality (awful) and companies like XFinity beginning to charge for data/bandwith (triple awful) I don't see this changing anytime soon (and become costly for the average gamer to change library on demand). Internet infrastructure companies are going to do all they can to keep net neutrality dead, at least in part to serve their own interests.

That, and chunking into Amazons hegemony in a few spaces, gamestop has room to run apart from the squeeze IMO. I look at Chewy's current stock price for reference.
The premium for 60c is about a dollar so he needs it to go above 61 to break even. 

I'm still learning too but delta has to do with how the contract increases in price.

Most autists use robinhood which will give you a margin call but they don’t actually make you close your position until you hit 0 so I don’t think the margin call is critical for shares we currently own unless the price really drops then the longs will be squeezed.

It just didn't feel very aesthetic. I don't know could be the autism.
Yeah I've been playing around with this idea since I replied. The premium is so high that the B/E isn't bad, assuming GME doesn't crash down by end of month. But that's a lot of collateral to tie up (same as buying 100 shares, I know). Might just buy calls.

This is coming from someone that had opened covered calls at $19 (cost basis on shares $17) and was supremely disappointed on Tuesday with my decision to collect $200 in premium on my shares that had doubled in value. Now trying to figure out a way back on the rocket ship.

That's my real gamble, my big position isn't a squeeze play to me. Been watching GME for months and this past week was very different. The combination of events unfolding told me to take a gamble.
So if you were buying calls then 1/2023 would probably be your best bet. I was gonna try and cheap out with the 1/2022s
That's a really good point actually, if they become a reliable source for used pc parts they will change the game

Lol "fake news". Fuck this expression. Some people just have bearish opinions, and some of them write for Barron's. Also, many bears may have cried uncle and quit as they suggest, but the bears are deeper than sharks teeth and we're eager to replace them at this fresh new "unrealistic" high. 

Think how many people told burry he was crazy during the big short on real estate. This isn't quite that level, but the bears on gamestop could populate a medium sized country. (The bulls in the big short could populate the US plus every other country).

The point is, the short position may have increased (I'm not convinced yet because I don't know whose data is good and whose is wishful thinking). But even if it did, it doesn't change the **long term bull thesis**. There is to much focus on what the shorts are doing. **GME is not about the shorts.**

This stock has a mile of upside and pretty well protected downside to 1.5B valuation, especially once covid recedes, for a few years at the start of this new console cycle. We need strong earnings and bullish qualitative catalysts. The only thing that makes me sell before we see cohen's changes take shape is a 5x short squeeze. IMO the squeeze is a sideshow.

Pseudo intellectuals like you are the reason regular people have a hard time filtering through bullshit.
I am saying that it will go through 50 fast if it’s near 50 then slow down a lot after. But pending updates of option structure. So strictly that would be more sell 51/52 without strong momentum if you are hesitant. It’s harder to move up over those numbers than earlier.

When a hedgie is paying 40% interest per year on a $500 asset that they shorted at $8, they’ve gotta let go.

At that point, even if the initial short was just 1% of the portfolio, the yearly losses to interest are 22% of the portfolios size.

I think that's the logical next step. I'm looking 5 and 10 years out and think it could be treated like multivitamins.  Able to be picked up in any store, easily shipped across state lines, and  not something you need a prescription for.  Maybe big pharma companies will control the more concentrated stuff that has to be regulated like prescription drugs?  Probably a mix of the two scenarios.

If Cramer cared he should be calling the SEC and ask why they are letting brokers continue to allow shares to be illegally sold short. Answer is because brokers are getting paid interest from short sellers who can easily afford it.
Impossible. Free speech. Like not even joking. In addition most people's retirement are in pensions and shit like that.

Can you explain to me how shorting a stock, “selling non existent shares to the open market trying to drive the price down” is legal. Seems to clearly be market manipulation which to my understanding is supposed to be illegal. Mass shorting of a stock seems to be the most obvious case of market manipulation possible. You’re selling huge quantities of shares that you don’t even own, driving the price down, and then directly benefiting from the lowered price... I also don’t even understand how shorting stock isn’t the stupidest play when it comes to trading. Limited potential profit vs unlimited potential loss. Maybe bc when it’s done by huge institutions they’re allowed to manipulate the price so they know shorting will work almost all of the time.

I’ve been thinking about it a lot and fuck I trust Cohen.

This is short term stuff, the real golden Apple is ahead. I don’t think a short squeeze like VW can happen because there is no way to force shorts to cover, they simply have more money than us and there are a lot of shares available for them.

What we need is a change in narrative for them to abandon their thesis and that will only happen over time, with good results each quarter, with a good plan. And I believe Cohen can do it.

To be fair I bought in initially in August with $1200, 100 shares at $4.89 and 20 $13 calls at $0.29 premium. Sold the shares after 100% return and have been rolling calls out. Still should be delta hedging on calls so roughly 20% of my shares exist somewhere.

Sold friday for 25.50 when GME was around 37. It's about as risky as buying shares at 34.50. I'm assuming it gets assigned.

Probably not the most efficient/effective way to play this but I was expecting a few days of calm before the next big move up. 240-300% IV on naked calls was too much for me.

I've seen this linked multiple times. Do we have an overlay of short interest? I remember reading an article explaining this VW squeeze a few months ago but I don't think they showed this info. Just curious, because when I look at that graph it makes it very obvious that it is probably going to be very hard to "time" this as a stock holder. You will be playing against your fellow holders to try and time/sell the top, because you can see that spike is fairly short lived in comparison to the moving average.

If GME was dead in the water and we were just hoping for a squeeze and squeeze only it would be a much more dangerous position.

High short interest is considered bullish since every short seller will ultimately buy the stock.

> The impact on any retail short positions is effectively zero.

Maybe you're missunderstanding what being a "retail investor" means. Not really sure. This quoted part is pretty dumb even for a retard. There are some numbers up there that explain why (retail) shorts are under more pressure than (retail) longs with the increase in margin requirements. The only way this is not the case is if the average short price is above the average long price. I think the idea of forced liquidations on the long side is a little far fetched given the recent price spikes but hey I guess it could always go either way.

I tried to sell the remaining 10 on Friday, but nothing happened and they expired and I now have 1200 shares of GME cuz I already had 200 shares. Why didn’t the order to sell to close 10 contracts go through on Friday? What should my next move be now? School me down.

I took a quick look through your posts but didn't see any great DD on this price target, did you post it on any other accounts? Just curious what your logic is about this other than simply "squeeze" which I think we are seeing is harder to do to that level than WSB has led itself to believe.
Does this mean that shorters collectively owe more stock, than what’s available?

Am I missing something? GME has a 51mm float and ~140% of the float shorted. How could 5.5mm shares represent the ~71mm shares shorted? Am I completely misunderstanding the way these values work?

I agree with you that home growing will go up.  I just don't think the majority of users have the time, space, or attention span to do it themselves.

Once it becomes legal at state and federal levels, big banks and venture capitalists will be more willing to invest in companies. That brings in money for lobbyists and further changes to the laws.  The money can help fuel rapid growth and make it even cheaper to buy. So it just moves things along faster.
I have clogged the toilet at best buys. Pm me if u want a pic

Gme is getting close to a short squeeze. Wich should (according to this sub) get anywhere from a 2x-10x. Then dip. 

Bb looks like it has been making huge moves lately and should also rise. But over a longer time with slower returns.

Basically: gme requires a more precise timing, but has more gains short term.

considering this article is from jan 11, 2021 i doubt it. also considering the fact he said himself he bought at 7.50 in 2013, we can clearly see it was actually 37.50 before the split b/c that's how much it was back then. why would he quote the price in the way you've described if he's taking 7.50 as his cost basis?

also as far as Kathy goes, TSLA's valuation is still ridiculous. She got incredibly lucky and once you make some crazy call like that all your other picks are self-fufilling prophecies because of the hype after until they aren't.

What is your guess for how many GME shares (or options) have been bought by WSB readers?

2M in the community \* 

10% following on GME \* 

100 shares on average =

20M shares

Both GME and BB will print for different reasons. RC will drop another poop emoji and or increase his ownership and additional 7% to kill the shorts and haters and this will skyrocket GME, and Mr Chen will continue to reshape BB with continued partnerships and vision since he stands to profit massively from hitting $16 and beyond. New partnerships with the government/major companies after the SolarWind hack would help. 386 GME shares and 150 BB shares. Getting more Tuesday💎🖐🖐

Was a community of toxic clan leaders creating toxic environments for their clan members and then putting them all in one forum to go at it with each other all day😂



& I just remembered I knew a guy on there that went to juvenile hall for some time for pretending he was apart of isis and attempting to recruit kids🤣 legit made the news and everything lol he was funny asf I miss him.


I remember hearing of a few others that went to jail for some time too, including my own clan leader rip. Anyways good times

Fucking christ this audio was loud. Nearly shit myself and I'm already on the toilet.
Same.
I think the inherent flaw with this logic is the assumption that 40m shares cannot be sold. Yet you also say that institutions and ETF funds are buying. They can't buy if shares can't be sold.

To put it another way, there's the 69m shares issued, and 71m shorted & resold. But if we ignore insiders and institutions that will hold for now, that means people OWN 140m shares and they can SELL up to 140m shares.

So when you say that about 40m shares won't be sold because of insiders and fund managers, that doesn't mean only 29m are sellable, it means 100m are sellable.

If the bank wants to fuck the system and say sure Polypheus. We'll give you a share of GME even though we're over the issued 69m shares, I  still have the right to sell that share.

[deleted]
I know I know. It just helps keep things in perspective.
I think your logic is sound overall. The thing here is that a short squeeze is really "artificial" value. Without organic buyers willing to pay the squeeze price it will pretty readily fall after shorts have covered, or as soon as new shorts come in; I seriously think this is the biggest concern that most here are not considering... if new short positions are established and GME does an offering I think the price is going to implode. Contrary to popular belief, GME still doesn't own the most substantial portion of stock to truly fight the biggest funds.

Money on the bills bro.. sorry, but DKNG has to give me some of my money back.
I used to work at a gas station and a few times a day the phone would ring. I wasn't allowed to answer it but my manager was always watching porn in the back and he picked it up. Sometimes he would hang up, walk to the front and tell me to go change the price on the sign out front. As far as I've been able to figure it out, whoever was on the other end of that call controlled the price of gas.
Yep. They’d hopefully do it when shares are deep in triple digits

If it 2xes again they’d all reduce again to right size their position. Melvin isn’t one of them but there are many others. 

If it 20xes margin call but they’d hedge vs that before it happened
Main reason they’d close would be impatience - too high cost to borrow plus belief not going down any time soon

Thanks. Siemens also announced a new project to develop hydrogen wind turbines which if i understand correctly will produce hydrogen via electrolysis. This is particularly interesting as hydrogen can be used in high temperature industries such as the steel industry, as well as the aviation industry and for domestic consumption. Wind is probably the best bet as i think the biden admin will go big on home solar, and help out utility scale solar, but go big on wind since it has a higher energy density/m2 than solar, and also because it will support domestic steel industries which will supply the steel needed for the tower and the nacelle. This would likely be popular since more steel and concrete is used to construct wind than solar, which will provide a domestic boost for the steel industry which has been heavily hurt by years of chinese dumping in the industry. The boom will also lead to an increase in construction and manufacturing jobs which could serve as a transition job for people in the oil and gas sector. I would also say that solar is worse for the us to manufacture as a large number of the panels are made abroad and also are harder to recycle/manufacture due to the chemicals used in the process which has led to significant pollution as well e waste not being disposed of correctly.

You can see in my post history it's hard for me to process or understand PTs above 200, but that doesn't mean I'm not praying for a legendary squeeze. With 2950 shares (maybe more on Tuesday, we'll see how things go), $340 is a magic number.

Me: Why do all of them say 69,420 $ROPE?
No, not necessary. Let's say I have a $30 call. When I sell it for $600 to the MMs, they hedge it by selling 100 shares (as the delta is almost 1). I reinvest ALL of my $600 profits into shares, but it's only 16 of them.

During a short squeeze they'd have buyers. Especially if you sold at a slight discount compared to purchasing shares directly. Short sellers will be looking to cover however they can.
If you're talking about within US, local and state taxes. Crude price is maybe 30% of the total cost.

If you're not in Cresco Labs Inc (CRLBF) you hate free money. Buying more shares next week.
I’ve been preaching they need a steam/epic like app and compete in that market, that’s a huge move though and that would need to have been in the works a while. But if that is the case GME could become a monster of hardware and software gaming
Wrong. It's to prevent them from taking a massive loss when the stock dumps. Maintenance Margin requirement for a long is 80% at IBKR and 30% for shorting. A regular stock like AAPL will see get you 30% each way. If you have portfolio margin it will be different.

These twitter "gurus" have no idea what the fuck they are talking about.
With DKNG it’s the same either way baby 😈

Market makers and high frequency traders will buy your contracts up.
deep ITM contracts have buyers they just often dont sell for much more than the intrinsic value because they are so deep ITM that IV likely won’t impact whether or not they expire ITM

So glad I’m taking a gap year to go back to school. I’m done being a PM and product manager. Gimme that individual contributor, keyboard jockey life as a data scientist.

It means that when the media says the squeeze has already happened, that is likely untrue. However, also doesn't mean it will happen Tuesday or this coming week. We need a catalyst (e.g. Cohen ups stake to 20%, Cohen named CEO effective June 2021) to ignite

I used to work in R&D. Burning money produces real world data, and data is valuable. It’s a good sign when those costs go up. 

In palantir’s case, they have defense contracts. If those costs go up, that means they are producing results, and the clients are further pushing for growth and progress on previous projects to be continued.

GME does this thing were wsb hypes it up, then as soon as it goes red everyone forgets about it then when the coast is clear (down trend) shorts start to cover and wsb jumps back in and sends it flying. At this point its not even funny how predictable this is.
Anyone who hasn’t been here for at least 2+ years should just have their comment auto-minimized

You are now part of this 

Hold the fucking line
I went 10c
> Cash: this would be the greatest opportunity for free massive cash influx at the expense of shorters by doing an offering when it squeezes

An offering would ultimately be helpful to the shorters, right? I get that prior to the offering the short squeeze would not be great for them but the offering alleviates the squeeze somewhat.

One thing to know is that robinhood will issue you a margin call but they just restrict buying new positions. They don’t sell your position or even make you sell it until you pretty much hit 0
GME will be at $100 by end of year. Minimum. Do it.
Which site is that?

The paper isn’t bullshit. Viral escape is a real issue and if dumb fucks keep giving the virus a home to mutate in we are going to have a Covid flu season. The title sure as hell is bullshit though.
There is a limited number of shares available. Bad guys will be obligated to eventually buy shares, but if we hold all the shares hostage they will have to buy at a higher price. So Buy now!
Bruh, wait till at least EOD Wednesday before you start freaking out. Yeah, it’s possible you could lose a chunk of money but Friday was a shit day for the market (even though $BB was technically green).

That’s me. Got butt fucked by the cigar butt. Had ten open naked 20 calls and 26 calls each and woke up when GME was at 36. Never sleep in on naked calls. If I had to guess that guy works at a place with dynamic hedging so would’ve lost a lot less. Ended up getting out Friday with a loss of 25k

BB is Canadian which is why it will be trading on the TSX Monday, if there is a ticker for it there then yes it should be trading - not sure if there is.  It will be a quiet day (probably) bc our markets are generally quiet when the American markets are closed so BB most likely wont make any big moves Monday or at least not like it would if the American side was open.  Maybe a good day to get in if you are able

If we don’t get some good news or a tweet from Ryan in the next 1-3 weeks this could be a long term squeeze. Longer than what most people expect.

I don't.  My last sale/re-purchase was $21.85, and $17.33.

I had a covered call at $36 that didn't get called away on Friday.  And I'm wondering if that's a good or bad thing, ATM.  I clearly had a top set far too low when I sold the call (when the stock was at roughly $30), because it went well above $36.  I probably should have sold 14600 shares covered by the call when it went to $40, but I did not (and then let the call expire worthless).  Of course, had it ended just above $36, I would have sold a big chunk of my position just at the time I was figuring out a new, higher exit (by selling 14600 shares at $40, and then having another 14600 shares called away at $36).

The current situation that started on Wednesday is going to make entries and exits much harder to predict, to be honest.  Much, much harder.

Stock prices tend to fall in the middle of the month. So, a trader might benefit from timing stock buys near a month's midpoint—the 10th to the 15th, for example. The best day to sell stocks would probably be within the five days around the turn of the month.

Personally don’t think the big squeeze happened yet, but even if it doesn’t. Take off will happen regardless. GME is already headed in the right direction especially with Cohen and the others members that are joining the board.
I said FRESH!!!

Some of those are 30 minutes old...
the future of cannabis is not growing plants.  It is growing cells in bioreactors.  Cronos bought a denver startup in 2019 called ebu that does something like this.  My long pic for this is BioHarvest  Sciences.  Yes it is a penny stock but they have a product VINIA make from red grape skin cells to promote vascular health hitting the US  in 2021 and already  available in israel.   I can't determine if what bioharvest does is significantly different the biosynthetic cannabanoids but I believe it is.

All non gmo, no pesticides, no soil hardly any space exact replication of cannabanoids reproducible infinitely.  Mods let it stand.  Any big companies doing this i would like to know about.

Someone did a s/o about BB tech the other day and it was seriously underrated.

I used to work at a company working on automotive computing platforms. Basically they made the car computers that the car companies would build on top of. We used QNX (the BB OS) on all the platforms. QNX is architected very different than Linux or Windows yet it is still largely posix-compliant. It was the only OS of it's type that was commercially available, unless you want to fuck around with the NASA spacecraft OS which no one does.

BB is seriously underrated. I like that they're really looking at 5G patents and other energies tech. I want to see them start to get their fingers into more infrastructure and security technology.

Yep, I lost $9k on Friday Diamond Handing $GME.  I felt sick for about an hour.  But, I have faith if we keep holding, there will be another wave.  $GME has too many good things going for it right now.  Even if the stock drops again, hold it and buy more! It will eventually pay out more than you paid into the stock, whether it be from a short squeeze or from the future value to come. Either way, you can not lose.

Damn, $2700ish (based on friday quotes) in premium for that 60p. A lot of that is IV, if IV continues to rise, its going to be hard to buy that put back for profit. 

B/E at that premium is 33 right? I'm just trying to figure out how risky this play is. Getting assigned those shares at $60 will be rough if you mistime this.

Um ok cool
Remember back in march when gamestop decided that their employees were *essential workers*? Everybody's freaking out about the plague and these guys got stuck dragging themselves to work without any PPE or clear preventative measure or nothing.

They're people getting fucked over by the pandemic that need a job. If you know anybody who's tried to find a job in the last year, you know how harrowing it is. And if somebody gets infected in your household and you're on the hook for the bill for a ICU stay? You're fucked. How do you pay rent? utilities? food? And now a new board wants to come in, lay everybody off and move the business online.

In most narratives, we're the bad guys here. We're the greedy investors that scream at the board cuz WE WANT TENDIES NOW.

Just something to think about.
That was my issue with the whole margin debate. The institutionals have deep enough pockets to cover margin maintenance even on a 100% requirement. The only way to hurt them then is to solidify the narrative that GameStop is *never* going bankrupt AND the share price will only continue rising as Cohen executes his plan. 

Eventually the shorts will have to capitulate and I foresee it as a gradual event since they’ve been resilient thus far in the face of strong catalysts and a rapidly increasing share price.
What do you guys think this will top out at before the merger?
Downvote not gonna help, it's a simple question. People should also think about this scenario before going all in.

yes and no.  this company has some kind of convoluted share structure that allows the 5 founders to convert their shares to common and sell them without giving up their control of the company.  its was a substantial talking point during their Direct Listing

1) I agree retail investors are more likely to get margin called than institutions. My post is assuming all institutional shorts are holding tight. My argument is that RETAIL shorts will be pressured out at a greater rate than RETAIL longs.

2) I doubt melvin will be forced out of their position or go bankrupt because of it. I'm talking RETAIL. The number of institutional shorts outnumber the retail shorts, sure, but unless you can show me evidence that 100% of shorts are institutional I'm going to assume that someone had the amazing idea of shorting a brick and mortar retail in the middle of covid lockdown all on their own.

My argument removes institutional investors from the equation. They do what they do in their own little world and for the most part we can't predict what they're doing because they're working with vastly different information, experience, tools, and priorities from us. Chances are this won't change their behavior in the slightest. My argument is that retail margin shorts will experience disproportional pressure relative to longs with the increased margin requirements, and this will cause buying pressure.

When you say you disagree to >0 buying pressure means you believe that more retail longs will be forced to close than retail shorts. If a majority of investors (both long and short) opened their positions 38-42 this could be possible, but otherwise math says pressure on shorts is higher than longs. Even in that case, consider that longs can do a partial close without additional capital and shorts can't. To have selling pressure you would need a hugely disproportionate amount of long closures relative to shorts. Even with us being retarded I don't see that happening.
Just think, that **$8.5k** you made ***just off shares*** could have been **-$27k** if you weren’t too 🐱 to buy weeklies
Oh my god. Oh my god.... yessssssss

Spr and aer were not one of the popular plays on wsb, so your gains aren’t because of wsb.
I read through some of your other posts/comments.  You seem like a decent guy in a bad situation.  You’re handling it better than most guys your age.  Focus on yourself and your own gains and you’ll be okay. Your kid is too young to know what’s going on anyway.
Dont wait for the inevitable, if you were going to dump the bitch anyway might as well do it now you prolonging it only makes it worse. Just send her a screenshot of your gains after im sure the wound will still be fresh then

Well written, I am sceptical how many retail investors are actually shorting GME on just these two brokers, Schwab and Fidelity. I can't wait to see what an epic day Tuesday will be tho.

Yes a brand can pivot. I really hope Reggie does a lot of the pr stuff with GameStop. He is legendary in that area, has charisma, and knows how to speak to consumers and investors. He should really be the new face of the company. He is slightly older than Ryan which should show confidence with major investors and is a company man who would most likely agree with Ryan’s proposals for the change that is needed!

🤣🤣🤣
Yeah, that's when they expire worthless at market close that day. You have to sell or exercise them before that.
it happens literally every week when a stock moons. you can use it to gauge buy in periods.

was that a different cut of the movie?
This is exactly what I've been saying and you're one of the few who's mentioned this. Selling GME for anything under 100 and you're basically being ripped off. This stock will handsomely repay the patient longs. I may be wrong but I don't see this stock lasting much longer under 40, we might have until Wednesday or Thursday to load at these prices.

Oh, no, I completely agree with the doctrine of laziness. I am saying that cost is the problem; laziness has to be met with price which means that the cheap liquor at the store is cheap specifically because if it were all expensive no one would buy it and everyone would just make their own.

Never underestimate the frugality of your fellow man; it is quite insane to see. People will go to great lengths to save less than a rational amount of money to care about even at extreme risk to themselves.

As I said earlier, it's anyone's guess where it goes, it might hit 1000 or not even hit 100, but that's the excitement of the ride. I'm not delusional, but at the same time, nothing is 100% impossible in the madness of the current market. I lost a good chunk of change in the downturn yesterday & still bought more.

I'm not paper handed, but I'm not going to let it take me down either. I'll watch carefully & take my tendies when the time feels right.

Oh honey I know a top when I see one.
It still closed at $9.55 which was above Thursday's close. Was a bad day for the market in general. Sleepy joe's poorly received stimulus plan and the news that covid vaccine supply is greatly diminished effected the market poorly. Honestly faired well for how the market was that day. Also it jumped 40% the day before...

If you’re asking why did they short Nintendo. Then I would guess it’s because they don’t follow what other console makers/ software companies due: rip off their customers with constant micro transactions and make glorified low-mid tier pc consoles.

61 hours until markets open.

I’m currently at the bargaining stage. Denial was short lived, placing and cancelling orders only got so far.
It was likely a correction from it jumping the day before and compounded by a red market. Sleepy joe's stimulus was poorly received and there was news that covid vaccine supply is diminished greatly which played a roll in the overall market. I'm sure there were also some boomers who took profit and are clueless to BB's new plans. It closed at $9.55, which is still higher than Thursday. Honestly faired well for what the market was doing.
How much is too much to buy the stock-? on Tues??
God is in the moon right now, can't blame him
Haha, I thought you bought ITM leaps. You have plenty of time, but you gotta diamond hand that shit.
Let me finish that sentence for you, "would be just 🚀"!
I'm yolo'd 30 shares and a 4/16 24c into GME, nothing in BB right now but with intentions of looking deeper into BB at a later point. Want to be properly strapped in when the real short squeeze actually takes off. I think BB would also be a good choice most likely if GME wasn't a powder keg with a lit fuse at this moment.

Maybe after the MOASS I can take some profits and multiply them with BB if it's still an ongoing play but GME feels like where "it" is at right now.
... .... ........
Do you have clarity on the stock issuance for Top golf purchase. I've read roughly 90M shares. is that at the fixed price of $19.60 at time of announcement or if it closes early 2021 and ELY is at $30 will they issue less shares to cover the purchase? 

I'm also curious as to why LT Debt ran up to $822M throughout 2019 before announcement of top golf. why were they taking on so much debt last year? 

Where in the BS is the 14% ownership of Top Golf they already had reflected? I believe in the other assets? 

Lastly - they mentioned a deal between top golf and callaway for exclusivity prior to purchase announcement. Was top golf already buying callaway clubs at their venues and selling TM apparel at their venues? (thus less upside value there)
You hold or buy or buy and hold. If you sell, you’ve failed.

The future is now, old man
I didn’t put much on GME, most of my money is in BB I think either way even if it’s the long run I’ll get my investment back there’s no way it’ll sit under $10 forever, it did before but I maybe one a few in the world that believes in BB.
[deleted]
you've opened my world
Find the common denominator.
3 calls ftw
So what's everyone's opinion on a price target in the long term, say 2-3 years? IMO anyone selling this stock under $100 is getting screwed.
Why? How does that benefit them?
Tuesday is when the market is open again. Closed Monday for MLK day
this is probably what will transpire
Sold GME at an average of 17. Made a profit of 200 lol then it sky rockets. It’s cool. I just didn’t believe in GME like I do in BB

I’ve gotten at least a dozen people who don’t use Reddit to buy GME. I’m sure there more people who don’t comment on my FB posts but I’m getting messages from people seeing my 900 to 1,100+ percent gains in a week and want to know what the fuck is up 😂

I’m telling everyone I know and I’m sure a lot of people here are too.

Between me and my family were holding about 1,000 shares now.
I still have a few calls that are deep in the money as well 🤑

Gonna diamond hand these shares well past $150 a share. I want to sell at the peak. Gonna try!

My man is dropping some next level TA over here. Instead drawing with crayons on the price chart he's using numbers to give us support lines and shit.

Jokes aside I love your posts, and it's something I'd like to do when I grow up. It's like using options for sentiment analysis kind of work to predict stock prices.

I was looking at GME options chain on Thursday and Friday and nothing really stood out. All volumes/OI were below couple of thousand contracts, which does not seem like enough to drive price by itself. If our assumptions are correct it took 50,000 contracts at $24 to stop rally we had two weeks ago. 

 Can you share some resources for us that would like to learn more about it?

I was the one affected with new GME margins adjustments by brokerages and I closed all my other positions to get all in GME. But my approach is Theta Gang and I am squeezing that sweet premium on all my long positions. Trying to keep some firm floor under me while leaving some room if we indeed rocket up next week.

What margin requirements?  Margin is a collateralized system.  To maintain a short position, you have to have 150% collateral against the position, via some combination of cash and other marginable securities.

When they change margin requirements on a specific security, they are changing what the value of the collateral is.  When they have margin at 50% on GME they mean you can use half the value of GME shares to borrow against.  When they drop it to zero, they are saying you can't use it as collateral for any margin borrowing.

*That change* is meaningless for a short, because they aren't using GME shares as collateral.
Holy fuck you're retarded.  The only reason us shithead americans are debating is because our government didnt do what EVERY OTHER "MODERN" GOVERNMENT DID, and PAY people to stay inside.

I like my boss. We have our disagreements, but hes a good guy.
Precisely the entire thesis behind this thing. The cherry on top is that GME has actual value potential as well, so sitting in it doesn't even feel bad. The real question at the end of the day is margin percentage of retail long positions vs retail percentage of short positions. Those two amounts are what will make it easy or hard to wait until that next catalyst.

It’s a combination of supply being cornered and positive announcements. If this sub owned 40m shares the price would then be in the low hundreds. Good luck selling it to someone after though.
Any word on IPO price for the ARK space ETF?
GME peak short squeeze price - I’m seeing some say 100 and some say 300. Is there any way of predicting?
They're known as bullish puts if I'm not mistaken.
Fuck yeah! 🙌 right there with you.
i plan on selling all at $550, so should i sell half at $250, then the rest at $550?
Cost. That's my driving point; the way that the stocks rise is that there is a revenue spike but legalization likely won't cause *more* smokers or at least not long-term users, so that means, at least in my line of logic, that prices will have to compensate for the demand but if the price is too high ... a terracotta pot and some pot seeds will suffice for most people.

The squeeze might not happen for a while, that's why we have to keep holding/buying. It's definitely expensive for them to keep shorting, but they have a fuck load of money. If they think they can pay for a few months now holding the shorts, in order for us to fold, they will.

This fella is a GME bear since day 1.. Look at his comment history. Also look at his two DD posts, trying to hide his bearishness by giving the small nuggets of positivity.

Where we're you two months ago with this DD? Where were you last week prior to our market correction to a fair value price? Just happened to come out of the woodwork now? People I know that have read this DD think the exact same as me, bear hiding in plain sight.

guys... the one fear that keeps me up at night is bagholding after the GME short squeeze is over... getting too greedy and not selling at the top. i know this is a frequently asked question but does anyone have a reliable idea of what the top could really be? i see a lot of people planning to sell at $420.69, but what if it runs up to 600+?? 800+? i mean profit is profit, but we all want those big gains. i personally don’t plan on selling till we hit $550, but jesus it scares me to think that i should have sold on a lower price if it doesn’t make it up there.

I make no claims in this post. I did in my prior post. And yes, announcements or large actions by hedge funds can move this unexpectedly

Hence me asking around on threads. Prior to the run up, I was thinking 50-75 would be reasonable. Then I started really considering the DD and arguments people have been making with available data. Now 75-150 is a window that seems reasonable, if very conservative for a true squeeze. The situation is very different from the VW squeeze, but even if GME 5x’s like VW that’s still 175-200/share for GME. People can and will argue that the short % means that a squeeze could lead to 10x or even 15x run up. We’ll see. Shorts are more consolidated and powerful than paper handed traders, but Cohen still likely has a ton of room to increase his stake. No one knows—I’m waiting to see what Tuesday brings (or if Cohen stirs some shit with a tweet on Monday).
my dick is hard and helmet is on
How do you know these "ramps" exist? Just curious.
So how blood red is Tuesday gonna be? Stimulus couldn't even give market a pump end of last week. Market had plateaued for a few days before that too. Definitely seems like very bearish sentiment
[deleted]
How do people see a stock that traded flat for two decades and decide to buy it? "ah yes, I want that 1.25% dividend yield"
Is there any chance that margin requirements for shorts went up? I still dont see how this would materially affect institutional shorts either way. I see these new margin requirements as bad for the GME holders as well, but margin rates have been high for a few days. Also if there is a reduction in the number of shares held on margin, then wouldnt that reduce the number of shares that can be borrowed or is that non material.
So if I understand correctly, if we have a week of uptrending value on the strike price, and a gap up to a high next thuraday near the theoretical $60 strike price, it would be wise to sell, expecting that friday the stock would tanks due to the reverse action you were explaining.

Alternatively, if the stock dives and were low $15-$20 it would be wise to buy end of day Thursday or at the bell on Friday morning because of the huge net buying. Do I have that right?

You mentioned its less options expiring than this last week but still a lot. Friday we saw a 10% drop, would this indicate we would see a potentialy similiar move on this day one way or another +/-

Plug rebound week incoming!
It’s bearish regardless. You sell the calls and gain a bit of premium, hoping to hell that it doesn’t hit strike, or it hits strike and you cover the calls for a measly premium meanwhile losing out on the future value of the stock that has now gone up. You wouldn’t sell covered calls in a bullish market, you would keep the shares.

Edit: regardless if it’s covered or naked, either way you’re fucked if it hits strike

Remember also that they plan to issue 90M new shares so after aquisition at current prices the implied value is closer to $5B
Yeah I have to admit I thought about grabbing puts on it at that time the last time I went in a GME there was like 2 people (it's still like that but I guess they figured it out 🤷‍♂️) and I was like K this is def gonna be GG but thankfully didn't follow through.

I sure as hell didn’t plan on it surging that far that fast that soon. I ended up writing a covered call on my position and used the credit from that to purchase more shares. Next thing I know I wake up one morning and it went from $20 to over $30 <2 hours. Definitely wasn’t expecting that situation to happen just yet.

Hasn’t  the majority of push from WsB just been drilling everyone to buy shares only. I think we have a strong footing with cash purchased shares. Also Institution 💎🙌won’t be swayed by margin calls. If shorters are already fucking bleeding with short stocks under $20 this would have to hurt them more than us
Not for situations like GME when it makes huge moves. 2-5% moves in the underlying it’s close

Nobody really knows. 

We don’t know how long the squeeze will be. 

We don’t know when it will be . 

We don’t know if it will happen 

But when it happens it will probably last a decent amount of time because there just aren’t enough shares to buy to cover. There is almost no escape

What we do know is that every catalyst makes the stock explode and makes it explode at an even higher rate because it started at 4$ and shorts have been losing since 4$. When it gets to 40$ it shakes out a bunch then goes to 40$ shakes out more who then buy the shares .

We also know that we have a Board at GameStop that is playing ball. So they will be soon releasing positive news when possible.

Are talking about the 1.9 trillion stimulus? 🚀🚀🚀🚀
The thing that’s happening right now is a ‘short squeeze’ plenty of posts that explain what it is. Basically 🏳️‍🌈🐻Melvin capital and others shorted way more shares than are available. If you hold shares they can’t buy them from the brokers, thus raising the stock price cause supply and demand. They are then fuk because they can’t cover their shorts and if they can the price would be so high they’d go negative. 

It’s unsure if it’s next week or further in the future. But so many posts say Tuesday will be the start. 

Options don’t take shares away from brokers so the supply is still the same. 

At least that’s what I think. I trust in WSB

I second this
I would have to disagree that this is net > 0.  

You are right in that institutions shorts would have to cover and close out of the entire positions while retail longs would only have to sell partial.

But my thesis is two fold ...

1.)  Retail longs are more likely to get margin called and sell than institutional shorts are.  Wsb retards have a much shallower pocket and cannot fund their account or trade out of other positions as easily as institutional shorts.

2.). The amount of institutional shorts far outweigh retail longs by a longshot.  Coupled with them having much deeper pockets, Melvin could easily rebalance their portfolio to shore up cash.

Overall I see this as downward pressure all things equal.  We need some sort of news catalyst that would spark institutional longs like guidance from Cohen or a solid plan.  There is only so much retail firepower left, bc all of us retards already fired our bullet and resources.  Maybe I'm underestimating the new retail wsb tards that get indoctrinated every day ... But I would be really cautious.

Be interested to your response.

No so they won’t sell easy. They don’t even know they own GameStop. These are the people that own ETFs that contain GME.

The companies (black rock or vanguard) have 100% allowed these shares to be borrowed by shorts, that’s how they make money and cover the near 0% fees on their ETFs (look at the vanguard total stock market etf). 

Now, they also have a unique dynamic in that if the price of the stock goes up they have to buy more in order to accomplish the objective of their fund. But, they also have to sell more if GME goes down. 

So basically they are guaranteed to be borrowed, and exacerbate moves up/down. Thanks for joining my Ted talk. 🚀🚀🚀
the lower your cost avg the better. lowkey, you did it wrong but WSB way, you did right.
Well as someone being realistic....what’s the realistic expectations?

Cause i honestly have no clue. I just saw rockets and bought.
Even if bb doesnt moon in a week or a month, this is a solid long term play.

DD doesnt even mention Cylance being owned by BB. Cylance has a higher market than BB, approximately 2x.

This is pretty damn bullish imo. Means at least BB will hit 18-20.

Speaking from a first time experience building a PC. Speccing it out is fun. Putting it together fucking takes hours and is fucking nerve wrecking because one wrong move and you will brick the machine causing you to spend additional cash just to replace the parts for your fuck up. I would definitely pay someone a service fee who is more experienced and comfortable putting it together day in and day out.

I've replied to a lot of idiots over the last couple years on here.  But, you might be the new king.

You can only short in margin accounts, because you are required to carry 150% margin coverage on a short position.  A change in margin requirements allowing a long to only use 25% margin against GME equity, or even 0% does *not change anything* for a short.
especially the icu number which only declined 69

You probably can’t margin on gme rn depending on your broker.
I’ve noticed several people (myself included) pushing for genuine expectations or prediction rather than memes. Guilty as charged if skepticism at 1000/share constitutes “doubt,” but don’t take people trying to form reasonable expectations and exit strategies as doubting the squeeze or value play that is GME. For me, it’s about framing expectations with the data we have.

Rod Alzmann on twitter seems to agree with you. He thinks that although the new margins cut both ways it slightly net bullish. If what you're saying is right and retail shorts represent a significant part of the position, then that's fucking fantastic. We trade a bit of the top for a lot of firing power next week which is where they will likely throw their last big fight to keep prices down before an eventual catalyst from RC. Imagine though if we get one anyways before Tuesday and the entire short position dumps. I'd cream myself. Anyways, 🚀 🚀 🚀.

You’re right David, we don’t know what you do. And frankly, I think I speak for many of us when I say that we are still trying to figure out why you keep doing the same old shit for a measly 6% annual return when you could be making outlandish bets on deep OTM calls and printing sweet tendies.

Should I be watching the markets Tues/Weds for fluctuations between 30-45, and sell whenever it jumps above $40, then immediately reinvest the profit back in when it goes into mid-30s? 

After this, what time frame are most people holding for? Know we're saying long, but realistically what does this look like, and actually how high are we expecting it to go? Is the $420 sell just a meme or genuine?

Let me give you some free advice my fellow autists. Never ever make the mistake of thinking that you know where the market will go next. Just a rumour can obliterate all these folks who are wasting their time trying to look smart by pulling numbers and trying to figure out where GME will go next.

Top is definitely in

Do any of you look follow startups on MicroVentures or OurCrowd?
The growing PLTR hype is making me nervous about the $33 2/5 poor mans covered calls I sold
Bills over 50 or under. Fuck
So realistically, should we be emailing them and asking to be taken off the margin account? Or does it really only matter in this particular GME instant?

You dumb? I said buy
FCEL gonna be ripping this week back to 20 for those sweet earnings.
This is amazing post saved for later. In the meantime I have sold a covered call at 45, am I in danger in any way? I don’t care if it gets called away. This is so rigged, I’m just in it for the rush, but I feel like this can explode one way or another.
No the more shorts the better, if they have seen the DD and still decide to short they deserve it
Bills money line I’m getting shitty on labatt blue for you bills fans
Can some1 break it down more? What are the edges of this company vs Maxeon, Finko and first solar?
Fuck under or over for bills???
Most PC parts are low-margin though
its too darn much for me
Probably mostly from TSLA AMZN GOOGL spreads yeah.

That’s a good play but I don’t think it will be filled. Worth a shot on Tuesday.

Seriously dude, put this video on your resume. It’s fucking gold.
How do you think it will go next week before earnings?
Naa. I prefer to be the change I want to see. So I pay my employees well. Work 4 days a week. And smoke hella weed. Stay angry and poor.
After we finish riding GME to Valhalla, take a look at Dillard's - DDS - for the next moon shot squeeze

\- 97% of float is short, Macy's tanked so little competition, and strong analyst upgrades across the board. I'd bet my '02 cherry red Miata that she'll hit
I mean data suggests it hasn’t. You must be a retard.
These autists got to me and that 7k It cost me is 1/3rd of my portfolio I just spent building over a month lol

CNBC autists will be flooding into GME next week from all the squeeze pumping going on.
He's jealous that Cramer is the boss, and probably thinks himself better than Cramer. Which I would too.
Does this mean I can buy shares/calls on margin Tuesday for TDA? Like is it 100 cash requirement or just my buying power is reduced 100%?
More fomo into gme pls. I don’t know when it’s dropping, but when it does the loss porn will be amazing.

Jpow has already said it will be 'years' before they raise rates.

He has said they will overshoot their inflation target before raising rates.
Longs but that train has left the station kinda
Why not options? And when do you think it’s gonna take off? Sorry I’m new
 Love to see it. Just tell him how to load that Stimmy check into GME
Damn good shit.
My pants aren't on fire.

Lmao the one dude saying WSB is the captain now

Unfortunately you are right
Do you understand that 1000 less patients than 126,000 is still WAY more than our hospital system can handle?
I'm holding those too 😬
welp gonna use my paycheck on more pltr shares 🚀🚀🚀
What’s zh
Should I do under 50 or over fuck me
Thank you for your DD. I wish I could have understood everything you said but I think I get the gist. For those having a whinge, they are smooth brains who rely on this type of DD that will get turned into a meme that they will then follow. 

Quick question(s) - I’ve bought shares so I’m a “long”? I can’t do options in the app I use (which is when you guess what a stock price might be?) which if I could would turn me into a “short”?
Bills. Allen and Diggs is such a lethal duo.

There’s a ton of shares short. We just have no evidence it’s Melvin at this point.
I'm short $PNIS, do I qualify?
Irony
Gonna be 100% GME, cause that shit is going intergalactic 🚀🌔🚀🪐🚀⭐️🚀🚀🚀
They are banking on the buyers running out of steam and that their pockets are deeper than the buyers. That’s the way I see it.
Stop. 👏🏼

Playing. 👏🏼

Weeklys. 👏🏼
If you’re short GME you’re a POS. It’s fine if you don’t want to join the battle, but contributing to the other side is a really shitty thing to do. These institutions are responsible for destroying thousands of jobs, and stealing money from regular people like you and me by doing manipulating the market.

Cramer has a realistic potential of becoming some sort of hybrid between Reddit and mainstream tv, immediately adding 1.8m degenerates who will watch every second if he starts talking about their meme stock, while the rest of cable tv is dying. I’m sure he will convince his bosses and we’ll soon see a wsb segment.
I’m here to win.
You know the only way to short squeeze is to buy shares. You basically decided to let everyone else do the work while you leverage your money to get a bigger return. You deserve this lol
Drop it tuesday morning @9:30. Don't give the shorts any time to plan
I think since no one - not even Cramer who claims to have read the posts - understands the actual value play here, they see the price action going up so fast they think it is sure to go down just as fast

I've been enjoying their growth so far. The best part is they are weed adjacent. They sell the things every grow op start up needs, seems like pretty safe bet to me.
Spot means the stock. Futures term sorry

I agree with point #1. And that’s it.
At least politics has some effect on the market
>My cocaine habits are under control at the moment also

It sounds like you need to pump up those numbers then. More cocaine = more profits.
I know you don’t think this huge squeeze and the price 5x will happen. With the possibility of it though, what would be the tipping point of the melt up? Would it be a certain price or catalyst from Cohen? Sorry For the questions I’m just trying to be as informed as possible to make the best trades.

Do we know Melvin has a direct short? What is the evidence?

Loaning shares to shorts - yes that’s the downside. I leave yield enhancement on in my accounts and trade stuff long that is popular to short though. The rebates are significant. Worth it to me. Maybe it is to you maybe it’s not.
Blood red open book it
Why would you even consider paying for stock suggestions?
I assume they anticipate massive profit taking from the bulls though. They don’t want someone buying the top at $1000/share on margin for it to dump
Bullish af
Not necessarily if they are selling naked calls. Which they have been.

Why did the GME squeeze happen anyway??

I think you really could see sub 30 or above 40 or both this week.
Fist look at my taxes. It’s always funny to see the total cost basis off all the contracts when you trade mostly spreads. Managed to break $10M in total cost for the year Jesus  👀👀

First time here but about to dump some of my holdings to pick up 100 shares. Possibly more
The politically motivated hit pieces are the funniest. The fact that the far left aligned in Silicon Valley refuse to do this sort of work just means that they have less competition.

No one really cares about these people when it comes to real world issues and potential conflicts. They just pay lip service to it so the children on Twitter don't throw a tantrum.

My personal retard strategy is to sell during freefall.

Please be $40+ by June 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Bills are overrated trash. 2-2 vs playoff teams, should have been 1-3 if not bailed out on a phantom PI.

This is my plan as well. $400 in now. $600 more tuesday for $1k.....may drop another 1k wednesday. Then sit and wait. Ill sell $2k when it hits to get my money back and keep the profit in for the ride. 💫💫💫💫

Get them in a room alone, and take it from there.
These guys have a lot of money, and GME is only one position in their portfolio. I'm prepared to hold for a few months. I think they will try to wait us out before covering.

Congrats on the sick gains 

Depends on your view. That’s basically owning the stock on margin at this point. Could hold or could flip to shares to reduce risk. Just understand selling will cause 100 shares sold per contract, and the money back into shares would be about 50-60. If you rotate to oom calls you’ll increase the amount of buying dealers have to do but risk your gains.
Yeah hopefully you don’t get any annoying or long lasting symptoms. Some people saying 6 months of no taste sounds miserable

$STZ (Constellation Brands) is mostly known for distribution of alcohol, but they own a large share of Canopy Growth $CGC. They have the liquidity and solvency, as well as the distribution framework for me to hold a position with them. They're pretty much the perfect sin stock if it becomes legal in the recreational sense. 

I just want to see the day where I can go to Total Wine & More, grab a fifth of vodka and some MJ in the same trip, it'll be like Toys R Us for adults that don't want to go to therapy.

We are legion. Shorting a stock over 100% is more retarded than anything this sub has ever done, it's their time to get burned.
It's a good question, in some cases it's because they're licensed to give opinions and have to disclose if they have positions, etc. - there are sections of regulation written specifically to govern communication with the public. I have a Series 7 (registered rep) and a Series 24 (principal) and there is alot of emphasis on this during the exams. It also needs to be made abundantly clear that these are opinions, and why you have 20 pages of disclosures on any financial document you get from a broker. 

I think it mostly comes down to intent. Recommendations are typically based on some analysis of the fundimentals or broader macro picture - but when someone says pump it ... It's obvious they just want people to trade to move the price up... Creating a false impression of strength of the company and thus drawing in other investors who might be less informed and so on and so on... There's another type of manipulation called "momentum ignition" that it would fall into.
I'll probably be aight, I'm pretty young and in good shape. Just gotta avoid giving it to my parents who are morons when it comes to this stuff

Frankly I don’t buy that. The low effort, amateurish DDs should definitely NOT be in the same category as the kind of DD we saw on GameStop. 

If we counted only the high quality shit (thinking steel, ICLN, SPACs, PLTR, MGNI, KROTOS), I think the win rate would be pretty damn high. 

That being said it depends a lot on your own timing for buys and sell

You expect a >50% jump in 3 weeks?
Just a tip check out #TheStrat on twitter! Those stocks haven’t reversed on the monthly or quarterly timeframes yet so I’d wait a bit in that investment.
If the price goes up, yes.
Exactly my point. An enormous portion of those will go bust or get supplanted. Sure, I trust Cathie, but given the very nature of ETF’s I’d rather do the DD on her DD and grab the most promising ones
You will have to cover it
Say what you want but, GME will not be sold and will continue to be purchased.
This makes perfect sense, thank you

Market is closed right now until Tuesday at 9:30am, so whatever you buy now won't be bought until market opens (if you didn't know😊).

 Just gotta go with your gut and listen to the stream of retards on here (the people with their entire lives on the line mostly. Seen people put all of their money/401k/retirement/etc... Into GME at 34+) and we'll 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 to the moon!

Plus it took a nosedive EOD Friday
In their investment day videos they said their rollout costs have greatly reduced and they are able to set up their software much quicker than they used to. 

I guess it will always take a bit of work as it will be custom for each company, but it looks like one of their goals is to significantly reduce that cost, and they are succeeding in that. They do the whole rollout for free, which is a huge plus for potential customers.
Let's go.

Yeah, the shittiest part of assembling a PC rig is that you have to buy MSFT Windows separately (relatively expensive).

To me it doesn’t make sense. The VW squeeze happened because Porsche had purchased around 70-80% of VW’s stock and the hedge funds had no place to buy the stocks but Porsche which meant they could sell at any price they wanted to. In this case though, there are going to be so many idiots who’d sell their GME stocks for a mere $45-50.

A possible senario for an infinity squeeze in your example would be the following:

Owners of the 100MM shares (that haven’t lended their shares) decide that they won’t sell or lend out shares no matter what, AND
One of the lenders (yes, 1 would be enough) who lended *some* of the 150MM shorted shares decide that they want their shares back!

Most short squeezes are not an infinity squeeze because everyone has a price! So at some price point the owners of the 100MM shares start selling! How high the price goes during a squeeze would be a function of how many lended shares are recalled by the lenders (Ironically, it is often for the purpose of selling those shares when they get them back!) and at what price point people who actually owns shares (and haven’t lended them out) are willing to sell their shares, i.e. 💎🙌 =>  🚀🚀🚀

Told people to buy SRNE before it had the run up on Thursday(1/15 7.50 call for .15). My reasoning was speculation based around Biden’s upcoming plan and their plans to increase testing and vaccinations. I would’ve posted one on GSK(glaxoklinesmith) as well had I not gotten the temp ban. r/wallstreetbets missed out on a 30% run up that would’ve netted a 15 bagger by Friday at mark out. SRNE has a 2b market cap

That’s kind of like asking what’s stopping yahoo from launching a sports betting platform like DraftKings since yahoo is primarily what people use for fantasy leagues.

Yahoo is not likely to enter the sports betting space as it can be considered a conflict of interest for them. Same can be said for ESPN+.  These companies are more likely to partner with fubo than be direct competitors. 

Amazon and Hulu are also just getting into content creation, trailing Netflix by years. They are waiting to see how sports betting pans out with companies like fubo before entering themselves, if at all. Fubo will have first mover advantage, which is huge.

Not buying it. No way a WSB poster talked to a woman in person for this long.
I totally forgot about Reggie. This shit is getting very deep and very personal very quickly.
That’s a good way to lose half in a divorce. Tell her. Maybe she’ll be down.
Try this explanation: 

I have an apple that I bought and put in a basket that holds all the apples from everybody everywhere. Short #1 wants to sell an apple but doesn't have any, so they make an agreement with the apple basket to "borrow" my apple and sell it, promising to put it back before I need it.

But then the apple basket makes an agreement with Short#2 to loan out my apple (that I don't currently have) and let them sell it.

Now three people have sold my one apple. That's how we get 300% short ratio (GME is at 250%).

Eventually they're going to have to buy back an apple each to give to the lending basket so the basket can cover all the apples it's lent out. But just because they're buying doesn't mean people are selling. If people think the value of apples will go up, they'll hold. Which means Melvin and Co will have to drive to every supermarket, progressively buying more and more expensive apples until they can pay back their debts. **But 300% short rate, means they'll have to buy an apple, give it back to you, then turn around buy that same apple from you again at a higher price, just to give it back to you once more.**

Failure to deliver is when shorts come by and sell an apple without making an agreement with the apple basket. Then when the person they sold the apple to comes to collect they just kind of look at them awkwardly and shrug. This is highly illegal, but is probably market makers and hedge funds collaborating.

It doesn't. But if gme wants to benefit of the squeeze they'll announce an offering at what they perceive to be the top. The offering will force the price down but an offering at 200 dollars puts more money in the bank then an offering at 12 dollars.

> Shorts have to return shares immediately cuz maintenance is at 100 percent

Jesus.  The retardation here continues to reach new epic levels.

That's not what that even fucking means.

Eliminating margin on GME does nothing regarding a short position.  A short position in an equity counts as "cash" with regards to margin.  You have to have adequate margin to cover your short position at all times.  Regulation T stipulates 150%.

Eliminating margin on GME means your GME shares... your long position, is no longer marginable.  You can't borrow against it.  If you had $100,000 in your brokerage, and you used your available margin to buy $150,000 worth of GME shares, and now they dropped GME to a zero margin position, you either have to come up with an additional $50,000 to deposit into your account, or you have to sell enough GME for your remaining shares to be fully covered.
ok great now i know what to expect. think they could get the price below 30$ ?
Ok cool. I just didn’t know it was for the next trading day as well. I thought it reset every trading day
They just keep paying interest on their shares while they hold the short positions. They have tons of money reserves to do keep holding. If the price goes up though they can’t short anymore and at some point they have to close their positions at a loss

My god you're delusional if you think democrat politicans won't push more assault weapons bans and ban guns.

"In 1994, Biden – along with Senator Dianne Feinstein – secured the passage of 10-year bans on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines."

This is from Biden's website bragging he did so.

"As president, Biden will:

Ban the manufacture and sale of assault weapons and high-capacity magazines."

It's literally on his campaign website. You know the democrat electorate argument is bullshit, they knowingly voted him in. Disingenuous.

Going by the infinity squeeze on volkswagen it's actually much better to hold through the spike and sell on the tail end, then sell on the run up. 3x as long to get out at the right time too.

>Monday it jumped to € 348, up 66% from Friday. Closes the day up 149%.

>Tuesday - Starts lower than Monday close but then goes up. During day it hits the high point at € 1K . It closed at € 945 that Tuesday.

>Wednesday - Porsche jumps in and offers shares to help the shorts. And price starts going down.

>Friday - Closed at € 495.

I’m going to read this a few times because it sounds like something I should understand, but don’t (well, not entirely).

A refreshing, post, and a reality check. This play primarily requires an open mind, and a fuller understanding of the money we’re betting against. 

I am left feeling slightly deflated, especially at the prospect of seeing $30 or less again, but I suspect this is down to a lack of understanding and experience.

Regardless, this is a fascinating situation, and should the shares break through $30, at least we have an explanation as to why, which makes it easier to hold on.

Thanks for taking the time to write this.

Most of your analysis is on options, at least as far as I can tell (new trader, also retarded). Can you translate your thesis to simpletons like me who only buy and sell shares and don't trade options? I'm holding right now and I'm not sure what the volatility you mention for next week - other than I should probably bail on Thursday or hold long term.

I appreciate the response, it’s helpful. I think your background in accounting also helps a lot when it comes to interpreting earnings reports as well... yes, being skeptical is very important. Most people tend to seek information to confirm their bias- glad you’re smart enough to do the opposite.

I don’t know anything about fundamentals, but I do know about unusual options activity. And there’s been some significant calls sweeps in FUBO recently... they’ve been buying every dip so far. I followed the call sweepers and picked up some February calls on Friday... maybe if we get a little volatility this week, I can get some cheaper shares too.
What does that mean tho?
I hope you guys listened to me and put the farm on the Packers & Chiefs this weekend. Them slam it all on Conor McGregor next weekend.

They are on margin unless you have emailed robinhood to turn to a cash account. But you are already settled, so you just have to shoot them an email and cross your fingers that they're fast enough
The margin changes are neither bullish nor bearish, they simply reflect increasing risk as volatility of the underlying increases.
As a golfer and someone who works at a golf course for a living. This is one of the most incredible shots I have ever seen in my life. Even though it was a practice round, no way would anyone be able to do that again if they tried

I bought a call for like November because I saw the chart looking healthy.

>One other thing - contrary to what I sometimes read, Melvin Capital was already squeezed, or rather, their dealer was by proxy. Wednesday was that squeeze. They bought a bunch of ITM put options which forced dealers to sell a ton of stock to hedge. When the price shot up, dealers bought into that short they made to hedge the Melvin puts, and now the Melvin puts expired worthless. Melvin can not be squeezed further unless they enter a new short position of some type. 

Ok, so Melvin bought puts and then their dealer got squeezed and the Melvin puts expired worthless. So what? that doesn't say anything about Melvin's core short stock position, those puts weren't Melvin hedges, and so Melvin's short position remains squeezable. 

Not sure why you'd say that.

>Yield Enhancement Program

>A pro tip I have for this sub is – if you intend to hold a ton of long stock that is in high demand by short sellers, you should get paid to lend it to short sellers. That’s how the option dealers make a lot of their money – I’m sure citadel is making a killing holding a ton of GME stock to hedge, and promptly lending it to hedge funds at 30% borrow rate, while having very little risk. Most brokerages don’t pay you for lending your shares out, but IBKR does. 

This is beginning to sound suspicious. Nobody should be allowing shorts to borrow their shares. Driving up the cost to borrow and reducing the shortable float should be **prime** objectives for people long 

**Not sure why you'd say that.**

I did see that volume has increased substantially yesterday for these and 30C of the same date. Hopefully someone sees something I don't, and I don't diamond hand $7,920 worth of calls to $0.

Cos it already ran up huge. Some are rotating out into value, more so is people having a heightened appetite for risk right now and making more speculative plays.  This is why are we are seeing a lot of huge runs from smaller companies.

Yesterday being red was a good thing. It set up the rocket for Tuesday perfect
Six figure salary. Still a wage slave. Cohen save this repentant sinner.
What do you want to know
So they lost $55m but they no longer have a stake in GME? 

Sorry if I sound like a retard.  I don't think anyone really knows what's happening with GME, we just trust the rockets.  

How many of the 79 million short positions are covered in this way? I saw that there are 79 million short positions and 68 million shares and realised that there could be serious money to be made.  

But as you said,  when our calls expire and we sell those calls ITM because we can't execute them ourselves we are handing the enemy a discount. 

Ideally we need to keep injecting cash into GME and not take the gains.  Thats easy if you are a massive corporate investor who has the funds to keep buying shares circa porsche on VW in 2008. But when you are reliant on a bunch of paper hand bitches to turn diamond hands this could easily fizzle out at $40 a share. 

I'm dropping my shares on Friday COB whatever because I'm not going to be a bag holder.  This can't last another week, we have paper hands.
wow thats disgusting, he lost a ton on a sucker's bet and is blaming other people
If the interest was below 5% you just wasted money lol
Not enough rockets for me to take this seriously
I don't think I have seen this movie. Which one is this?
theres most likely going to be some pressure relief from calls having expired friday, and i think the majority of them wont be exercised. but i dont think that changes the bullish fundamentals of GME, and there will be further correction upwards looking for a better valuation, even outside of the short squeeze.regardless its going to be a bumpy ride.
How much more upside do you think?
Okay imma empty my savings and buy 150 shares Tuesday

Too poor for TSLA 😭
This was always a q4 earnings play.  March/April.  These things don't just happen overnight unless RC drops another bomb next week.. I'll admit I have 18c and 20c for Jan 29, but my first positions are 14c for april.
The form lists 5.4m shares short - in a line that says put and values the position at 55m.
It's very important to understand that when Melvin does a short sale on the equity they are essentially selling non existant shares to then open market trying to drive the price down...its an expensive manipulation strategy. Also, when they sell puts, MMs need to hedge which also drives the price down.

TLDR, there is no price target. If we all put sell limit orders at 420, then that's the price target. That's the price Melvin has to pay to close their shorts.

✂️✂️✂️✂️✂️✂️✂️✂️✂️✂️✂️

to all of you who are thinking about selling GME, trust the process. A couple weeks ago, people bought at $22 and sold for a massive loss. Yesterday several people bought at $38 and probably sold at $32 for a massive loss. Those paper handed pussies could have been in the deep green right now, but they have no faith. Even if you bought at $42, you will be in the green soon. DIAMOND HANDS 💎

Oh my fucking god look at the math retard. It’s the second most shorted stock and it isn’t even close to being covered. All that’s gonna happen is big money is going to keep holding and covering to keep the price low and scare retards into selling.

140% of the stock is shorted right now. They overplayed their hand. Literally the only bad play right now is to sell. Hold your shares and if everyone else does we all make money.

This isn’t fucking hard.

I’m trying to jump on the GME bandwagon with a brand new RH account (opened yesterday after business hours). Am I just out of luck?

I’ve got cash to spend, but my funds won’t be settled until late next week. My plan was to use the $1000 instant deposit to buy shares on Tuesday, as that seems like my only option. 

I also opened a brokerage account with TIAA (I already use some of their other products), but same story. I won’t have funds deposited in time if things take off on Tuesday or Wednesday.

I've skimmed through this long post and two things, which flag to me is "OOM" I assume you mean OTM? 

And secondly regarding the up tick rule, I found the following "No Market-Maker Exemption. Many commenters on the SEC’s April and August 2009 releases had urged that any new short sale restrictions contain an exemption for bona fide market-making activity. As noted above, however, Rule 201 includes no such exemption. This contrasts with Regulation SHO’s “locate” and “close-out” requirements, as well as the SEC’s 2008 emergency actions. It remains to be seen whether the absence of a market-maker exemption under Rule 201 will decrease liquidity."

Doesn't the 52k puts Melvin purchased at $24 that was declared on the sec site counts towards the short interest, no? I'm wondering that he hedged those against the cheaper puts he already sold to cover his loss, and this 140% short interest isn't what it appears as Melvin won't be forced to cover as everyone seems to think..?
I read your whole post. So because the float is still quite large, do you think it's just not going to be likely for awhile that brokerages might margin call shorts? / Realistically, is a short-squeeze really only likely if GME's board recalls shares through a change in ownership?


Things seemed... simpler before this Wednesday. Now it seems the big MM's have all the power manipulating stock through all these different options and short strategies

If you're already deep on GME, go BB, otherwise GME, I don't think BB is going up anytime soon, more of a longer term play but I can be wrong I'm just a retard here

what if the bubble won’t pop?
It's very important to understand that when Melvin does a short sale on the equity they are essentially selling non existant shares to then open market trying to drive the price down...its an expensive manipulation strategy. Also, when they sell puts, MMs need to hedge which also drives the price down.

TLDR, there is no price target. If we all put sell limit orders at 420, then that's the price target. That's the price Melvin has to pay to close their shorts.

to all of you who are thinking about selling GME, trust the process. A couple weeks ago, people bought at $22 and sold for a massive loss. Yesterday several people bought at $38 and probably sold at $32 for a massive loss. Those paper handed pussies could have been in the deep green right now, but they have no faith. Even if you bought at $42, you will be in the green soon. DIAMOND HANDS 💎

You're probably a 📄🤚 little 👶 who sold BB and GME too early. Had to pay for your 🌈🐻 drive in.

Was the movie good or was you too distracted hearing your wife getting the good dick from her boyfriend in the back seat?
Could you elaborate on what’s wrong with management? Not arguing, just want to make sure everyone has a full picture of this company after reading this post.

I don’t disagree that the company didn’t do much of anything of value during its first decade or so as a public company, as the chart shows. Even right now, they generated only $28M in revenue through Q3 of 2020 which isn’t great. But my DD was more about giving people an overview of some potential opportunities  in the near future. This sub loves GME and BB, companies with historically poor management, and this is a play that offers similar upside for speculators in the next few months IMO
He sold on Tuesday, the right for people to buy at $20. The stock was in $35+. So he lost at least $15x100=$1,500/contract and said he sold a lot.
oh right, yes
Definitely.  Look at their 1 year, 5 year, 10 year etc... they're an incredible company.  Biggest threat is regulatory, not competition.

Even if I wasn't bullish I wouldn't buy puts on amazon.  I'd rather buy puts on Tesla tbh; amazon deserves their valuation (I wouldn't do either).    I've held amazon for a long time, and I've bought more during the past month downturn.

Tuesday
So are we all on board with the fact that the minimum GME will soar is around the $100 price point? I’ve got a cool 100 shares to buy now for Tuesday. I’m finally convinced this is the way after weeks of watching along.
It's easy to say "look you retards of course that was gonna happen" after the war. I mean we could have avoided every economic crisis thanks to that. The thing with GME is there's too much shit backing it, so it's hard not to believe it will go up, and i'm not just talking short term here. Even if the squeeze doesn't happen for whatever reason, the stock is still severely underevaluated right now. But you're right, anything can happen because the stock market can be a bitch and those short fuckers might have some tricks up their sleeves. I'm totally prepared to lose money on GME. It's a casino, but i'm only gambling what i'm comfy losing. I would be sad because of the meme and the data etc ofc, right now it's really hard to believe nothing will happen
Sometimes it feels like the more and the louder the autism leaks, the more the dying dumb boomers feel like they need to prove themselves. That's when they get rekt and give us our money back. And I'm okay with it.
Literally all in.
is this the explanation for what's going on with Melvin's short position too? They're rolling that 55M in puts over to some future date at a new strike ?
I did. I just cant set a sell limit on this app
People like you make this place less autistic. Thanks OP
Its very possible.  If OP is right you could have a great chance at a big payday, but not a lot of stocks of nearly bankrupt companies turn into goldmines after already doubling in a week.  Don't do it if you aren't prepared to potentially lose it.
[deleted]
That could be the case but then it would also present a great buying opportunity for everyone before another big run up. I dont see GME losing to a big dip from shorts. If it dips under 30, everyone should go all in for another jump

Why has big tech been flat for so long? You guys think earnings will get them going again?
You understand the stock price doesn't actually impact the companies results right? The price going up or down does NOT create more or less revenue. It may make it harder for them to issue more shares to raise funds but debt is super cheap right now if they were to need money to grow.

 The companies results normally impact the stock price but not always.  It is a loose correlation driven by INVESTORS sentiment and macro events. The economy could tank dragging down the stock price and GME could actually have great sales and their stock could trade flat. It also depends on how other companies are doing.  Gme as an investment is competing with other companies for investor dollars based on return vs risk.

To add to this. It was a big options expirations date. Underlying shares held by MMS sold the shares most likely, instead of holding them because short demand was lower because of SEC uptick rule.

As someone who’s holding shares, arent you exactly the person I’m hoping loses money?
Need a catalyst event in either direction, or need someone to pile in. If a big hedge fund comes out and buys a few million shares, that sends this way up. If they come in and short a few million shares, that sends this down. To move a stock, you either buy it or sell it.
Awww look at me I made so much money I owe a lot in tax :/ 

Bro very few relate and even less care
Already on it
and by game i mean short squeeze
No one planned it to surge but everyone anticipated it. Just like everyone is anticipating it will squeeze. No one can plan when it will squeeze but everyone is anticipating that it will squeeze. At this point nothing is natural about this stock. It has not been natural at the $10 and $20 level because fo how artificially has been suppressed. I think the first paper hand shorts have been shaken out and thats what se saw last week. Again I want to stress out that this squeeze if you wanna call it that, grabbed the attention of the media and it will be looked at more closely than before, especially now going into the next quarter.

Have a Break. Have a Kit Kat
No U
I’m retarded too, no worries. It means that I bought a $22 call option that expired on January 15th (1/15).

I don’t remember what the premium was but I can use an example right now. 

If I bought a $37 call option for GME that expires on 4/16 (April 16th), I’d pay a premium of $978 (each contract is 100 shares so $9.78 x 100 = $978 premium, this is what I’m paying) 

To break even, the stock must hit $46.78 (+29.08%) and anything beyond that, are gains. The only money I can lose on a call option (long) is the premium I paid.
Good diversification 👍🏼
confirmation bias is why
It’s looking like a better buy, I’m hoping for 70 by mid February
Call your guy, your local branch, or even the national number and ask them about getting in to the "**Fully Paid Lending Program**."

Smart people disagree. I think this could run to 60 or 70, but not beyond without material changes to things. I think its more likely to go down. But again, smart people disagree.
Accuse me of paper hands, but it is also a dangerous game.   You try and play for the tippy top and you are likely to be the one left holding the bag.
Thank you for the analysis, I saw your post a couple days ago and that's what kept me cautious and didn't immediately all in Friday(did still bought a decent amount). I have a couple questions.

1. I did a simple search on Reddit and it seems like the argument for a GME short squeeze already existed a year ago, the stock price has increased several folds but the actual epic squeeze never happened, while the shorts have been high volume the whole time. Why is everybody suddenly so confident the squeeze will happen in the coming weeks? Any reason other than the big gap up this week? As you said, the institutional shorter have deep pockets that they will unlikely got margin called without stock price increase crazily in the first place. 
2. Now that everybody is aware of the possibility of a big squeeze, what would you do if you are the big money short sellers? I don't imagine they will simply sit and die. Is it possible for them to gradually cover the old shorts and set up new shorts so they never cause a big squeeze?
In my closet, on the shelf in the back, collecting dust.
la clippers?
the highest snap percentage of any back this year was 77%.  If he’s getting 70% snap rate that is top 5-10 snap rate in the league.  Henderson is a non factor at this point. Akers is the future, been pretty obvious late in the season.  Completely taken over that backfield.  I am hoping however that people see 2020 stats and he slips later in the draft than he should.
But you hate names?

I think they will get more contracts lol. No doubt. But thats not gonna hve the effect you think itll have. Pure and simple its overbought. Rsi says so. No institutions are coming in this high above the vwap. Either a miracle happens and cathy throws down on it or some shit or this is going to fill the gaps it had coming up. Thats just how it works. Only retail is buoying it up at these levels, momentum is gone. So unless you get the cheersquad over at stocktwits to be more effective youre outta luck. Be smart, let it dip further, take the discount if you want it so bad.

It's 5,400,000 notional shares short via puts. That means they are sythetically short with a put, so if price goes high enough, they just lose the put. Value of the put was 55m bucks, so they paid $10 a share for that put - in the money for sure. That got wiped out wednesday. DD on WSB indicated those were expiring this friday, big tranche of $25 strike puts.

"covering" happened in the form of their dealer covering their short which was hedging the calls they sold to Melvin. That happened.

>	[Jack Dorsey, Twitter’s chief executive, was working remotely on a private island in French Polynesia frequented by celebrities escaping the paparazzi when a phone call interrupted him on Jan. 6.](https://www.nytimes.com/2021/01/16/technology/inside-twitter-decision-trump.html)

>Mr. Dorsey was concerned about the move, said two people with knowledge of the call. For four years, he had resisted demands by liberals and others that Twitter terminate Mr. Trump’s account, arguing that the platform was a place where world leaders could speak, even if their views were heinous. But he had delegated moderation decisions to Ms. Gadde, 46, and usually deferred to her — and he did so again.

Why does Jack still want to be CEO of Twitter? He seems so checked out of it all.
True dat. Also, where are the rockets?

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Out of 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
My current theory is that brokers (maybe with a nudge from those filthy bears at melvin) have noticed that most of the retail long position is actually pretty leveraged on margin accounts. Naturally as volatility rises on positions, brokers raise margin reqs so that they can minimize their own risk (and in the process margin call all these positions helping out the shorts). And that's why they're presenting such high short availability. They're expecting a lot of long positions to free up next week. The bullish counter argument is that these raised margin requirements should also fuck over retail shorts by raising their margin requirements which is a lot more lethal since shorting is based on the premise of high high leverage through borrowing the entire share. Also, some say that margin calls beginning to show up at these lower levels could be indicative of similar albeit less intense things happening at the institutional level. So overall, you're right. This is not bullish at all, but we'll find out more on that later. The real light for us tho is that GME is a long anyway hold to begin with especially with all the DD thats coming out on what they're doing with their stores. If we hear anything from them or RC anytime soon this thing will blow, the idea is to hold our position long enough to keep the price high until then.

It's currently 4% interest. I'm collecting $6.46 daily on 2210 shares loan. 

My 2210 shares were loaned at a cost of $59,015 (~26.7 per share) 

$59015 x .04 = $2360

$2360/365 = $6.46 per day. But it hasn't been everyday since I signed up.

I'm just holding and selling covered calls so it's just an added bonus money to me.

Thanks Chimpu 🐒🐒🐒🐒
yeah, sometimes they have some reasonable articles on certain hype stocks like QS or hydrogen stocks. I personally like it because it provides a decent balance to my usual extremely bullish hydrogen/green energy news sources.
Yeah pussy, you won’t
Hell yeah brother 🚀🚀🚀
What I dont understand is why wsb is so assured that rising margins are good. 

As you said, institutions have deep fucking pockets, the only one getting margin called is us.
Might be a big fucking trigger in favor of shorts.
BUT THE P/E RATIO IS LOW!! THIS WONT BE LIKE 2009!!!
I think the other ARKs are going to start catching up or even outperforming but you can’t really go wrong. Even PRNT and the Israel innovation etf ripped face this month
Name checks out
do you think a squeeze might occur ? whats a general timeline if so?  Im going to hold for my life but im a bit scared .
Don't have to imagine - I did :)
Yea but its not the MOASS that gme gang is looking for. Someone posted an article where some short squeeze analyst said the run up wasn't a product of a short squeeze but people going long on GME. Why wouldn't you keep doing what's working?
Sometimes!
>they used puts, and don't have to cover.

They don't? 

My understanding is that they have agreed to sell shares at whatever the price was when they executed the short. So if they shorted it on Friday they will have to sell those shares at $35 a share.  

Unless they bought the shares at that price (which doesn't make sense) then they will have to buy shares at some point between now and when their shorts expire to cover their shorts.  

The only way out is if they have long short positions and can outlast the autists.  If they can hold off buying for another week,  some paper hand pussies will sell for a loss or breakeven, or even a 1% gain, allowing them to cover their positions. 

What am I missing?
If people don’t follow through it can. 


We know the company is worth more than 30-40. We aren’t pumping to make call gains. We are pumping to cause a short squeeze and kill off Melvin. Their cover attempts will spike share price. Once we know we are at the top of the spike you can start selling. Melvin has more to cover than alll of us except for DFV. DFV is largely in Calls  though. His calls will go to 10m+ value.

You need to post this to the main board. Our fellow autists need to know and get involved

Lowes also has a 15 billion dollar buy back of almost 20% of all shares. Think about that.

Can you be considered “on the spectrum” if you are bad at math? 
Sincerely, 
a true autist.
I agree that we've already seen people enter the market based on the news, and the post-squeeze price will probably be around this price, maybe even lower, for a long time until Cohen's changes start to be implemented and yield real results.

But here's where you're wrong: the squeeze hasn't even started yet.
My gosh can you idiots please stop upvoting any gay gains post with freaking GME? This is WSB. Get your 4k of shares and take it to r/investing. That's not a YOLO.

It's a fair question, plenty of people wanting to know if we already squeezed, could squeeze next week or sometime in the future. 

Lots of people saying to hold/buy and wait for the squeeze, and I will because I have already made back my cost basis as of last week. But we still want to get some idea whether or not we will 🚀 next week.

I am pretty sure everyone here wants GME to 🚀 but we also want to plan our strategies a little, we can't always go full retard.

Browns have a lower chance of winning than their ML implies. They got lucky they got 5 TOs vs Big Ben, including a fumble TD. Mahomes doesn’t turn it over like that and their offense is even more elite (Steelers put up a ton despite all the TOs).
M13 gang rise up
SPCE is only one component of ARKX. I’m guessing we will see a lot of satellite companies and defense (LMT, MAXR) added as well. Considering the need for high resolution satellite imaging and intelligence, I’m especially bullish on MAXR.

Calculated with Greeks , many variables tbh.

 You lose daily value through Theta , a high theta means you will lose more value on your option per day, something like TSLA or AMZN, flat days will kill you. A low theta means price holds steady because the stock usually doesnt move much.

 Delta means how much your option will increase per value in relation to the underlying stock. A delta of 0.5 means for every $1 the stock moved towards your strike , the option will move $0.50 in price . which of course means you'll gain $50 in premium ($0.50 x 100). Delta changes the closer or farther you get to your strike. A farther strike will have a smaller delta and a strike that is close will have a delta very close to 1.0 and a deep ITM call will also be infinitely close to 1.0 but will never exceed it because it'll now move $1 for each $1 the stock moves. This is why ITM options are very expensive. 

IV(Implied Volatility) is a measure of the recent or expected volatility being priced in. For example , stocks with earnings coming up have high IV and will be more expensive than at other times in their record. It's pricing in a move. This also means IV crush is possible where the stock doesn't move enough , say 3% after earnings and you think you made profit but it'll crash because the move was less than expected and IV will fall, taking away all the IV that was priced into the price of your option. It works to your advantage too. Say you're in a stock that moves 2% on average and news drops that makes it fly 20%. IV will be through the roof and you'll most likely make a lot of money . 

The other greeks also affect it but not as much as the previous ones i discussed. You can Google 'options price calculator' and play around with it but there's not a single options trader I know that bothers with any of that. There are too many variables to try to plan a specific profit. You can make profit on an option without it ever actually being ITM, as long as it moves in your direction , you could even sell early when the stock is at $60 or $70 and still make a profit. Trying to hold out for it to be exactly ITM doesn't work out a lot of the time. It's mostly experience tbh. You can kinda tell when you aren't comfortable being in that trade anymore and you take profit. I'd say about 70% of my trades are never ITM before I sell if I take an OTM trade. I would sell when I've made a good enough profit and move on. Sometimes it works out because the stock reverses and sometimes it keeps moving , just the way the game is played. I would enter a trade focused on making a profit and not on selling once it's ITM. Never hold out for a specific gain unless you're very certain about your position or you got in early before a rally, it's almost never worth being too greedy.

Current fee rate: 32%
Also they have 1.3m right now, but had 50k Thursday evening. Their available shares for shorting only went up all day Friday (meaning very few chose to short on Friday after early morning which makes sense since they could only do it on upticks). After they got 1m shares available and it didn't go down, the fees did which means demand was down.

From front page. I've seen a lot of talk about GME and part of me thinks "Maybe now is time to give this a shot. At least everyone seems to be having fun." But I'll admit, the terminology of how to actually buy and enjoy the ride has me completely baffled and confused. And that's just for the normal posts. Then I see something like this, and realize I'm so uneducated on this that I hesitate again to make any sort of move. 

Where the fuck do I even start?
I got in at 11 and it pretty much went up every day, definitely my best stock. Sold it to get into GME, but this stock was such a champ.

People need to stop thinking about the short squeeze which has yet to happen and go long on GME which is the thing that actually ran it up to 40. Focus on whats working and stop down voting people who point out the facts. If yall keep buying and holding the price will keep going up and then shorts will give up. Battle of attrition = short squeeze 🚀 🚀 🚀

I almost agree but I enjoy seeing the posts in aggregate - if everyone is giddy it's time to write options, and if everyone is suicidal it's time to buy them.

Nothing is a loss If you never sell. I'm not worried about which direction GME goes since it's going to be a long hold. If it squeezes damn right I'm selling but no point in selling if it dips for the next 3 months.
Can't stop! Won't Stop! GAME STOP!

They win by not covering their short position. Not buying back. They can pay the interest.
This is correct, a few will dip into Partial DiffEq or Linear Algebra as well.
lots of pump and dump activity on it. twitter especially bad about it. I'm bullish but got in at 14. Wouldnt buy now.

What you’re missing is the autism, we’ve got crammer endorsing us to the boomers, a million autist buying shares in the multiples, and to top it off, we’ve got everything in our court to squeeze the most. Most importantly if every autist holds (which we all most likely will), even if some lurkers buy in and sell for profit, the diamond hands show after. Just buy and hold till the spike and you’ll make 💎👐. Just as long as no one falls for the panic sell or tries to buy calls, we’ll do fine. Just spread the word, make sure everyone knows not to fall for the bluff the shorters are going to try and we win. I’m buying a hundred more shares come Tuesday if not more.

It would not be the first time that only the market makers win. They are making mad bank lending shares right now, and then gouging this sub on taking offers at bid/ask on contracts.

This is all good and well, but unfortunately BBY typically falls or goes flat after earnings... just an observation
Thank God 'cause my shares settle on Tuesday.

Similar to options they can roll the dates over. But they’ll have to pay interest over time and it can compound if unpaid over time.
Also, the cost of opening new shorts has very high rates due to limited float.
On top of this, SEC rule just took effect that they cannot short until price goes up. So they can’t artificially drop share price.

Why is m klein’s SPAC banned? It has a larger market cap than most SPACs mention on this sub?
No but as price goes up, the original owner can demand shares back to sell. Then short seller has to buy back. 


Since the sec rule is in place for now at least, the buyback can only occur at uptick prices which can contribute to the squeeze.
it can be both

gonna be honest a lot is in GME but I have like 7k in other stocks and using very little margin
Most likely not, but it will be whether or not margin calls happen on GME. After talking with some people margin calls may affect bulls more than the shorts, because any institutional money can cover their position most likely while any bull balls deep in there will probably have to sell. I have faith that we'll be fine though, because I'm leveraged to the tits, and my margin requirement is still pretty low because I have a little bit of money in other stocks still. We'll see what happens, time will tell.

That’s what people said about pet food for chewy. They said that it was cheap and easy to get on any website but especially Amazon - why would anyone bother?

RC said pet food online was like a flea market. Confusing, too many options and nothing really catered towards the owners. He bet there was market share for a customer centric pet supply business and got laughed out of investment rooms everywhere - this ended up with Chewy.com

He’s betting the same thing w GME. Check another post for “build-a-pc” kiosks launching at multiple stores and a push for employees who get computers.

The Uranium price jumped 30% back in April I believe. How do you know that this wasn't the full extent of the covid supply shock correction? From what I see, there is little to no upward movement on price since April despite many new contracts getting negotiated. If miners of uranium are so well positioned due to the lack of supply because of the even more exaggerated covid shock, then surely the spot price would be rising. Its not.

Same boat. First week being in the sub. From what I’ve gathered, it’s looking like possibly GME should spike if not peak from this whole thing on Thursday. 

I’m just a fuckin tard tho so what do I know.
Nope. I'll hold these until the big show.
1. You can deposit additional funds to increase your portfolio value (minus any cryptocurrency positions) above the margin maintenance. This will allow you to keep your positions.

2. You can close some of your positions by selling shares or exercising options. The proceeds from the sales or funds or shares from exercise will help cover your margin call. This may allow you to avoid depositing additional funds.
If I made like, 10mil I know I would immediately gift away at least 1million to friends and family.

This is actually a key metric companies like Netflix uses strategically 

https://innovationtactics.com/contribution-margin-learn-netflix/

Pretty absurd how many people fall for these tactics
To tech communities I've been in:
 - optimised for growth and change = startup
 - optimised for profit and stability = business

PLTR seems somewhere in between the two now.  Still chasing growth pretty aggressively, but compromising with some profitability too.

On the other hand, there's often an extra condition for "startup" which is that it must be privately held, so I guess by my own usual metrics they aren't a startup any more.

You’ve got to build in a fair percentage of investors that will trim when the ballooning price causes the holding to be overweight.

Also, a lot of WSB has low exit points in mind and there are definitely many paper hands. Some novices will try to swing trade and lose some of their holdings.

But I agree completely.  The forces have shifted in our favor again, and there really close to a snowball point.  RC is going to flex, and we’ll hear MelCap blowing up in the distance.

I’ve been building my position since August, and have been compounding with options.  It’s been a hell of a ride and I’m jacked for the next phase.

On Tuesday I’m liquidating all my long term positions for gme, the gme gains will be greater than the losses from a cap gain going short term instead of long.

I’ll be buying in chunks if there are any dips, and whatever is left will market buy at the close.

If you don’t learn from the past, history will repeat . GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀
GME's market cap is 2.7 billion. Far from "small".

You realize 13% or even 20% is nothing when compared to the VW squeeze right? That literally will make no difference here. 

But a billion dollar + market cap is "such a low" News to me. Sounds like you are a noob. WSB has been pumping this stock since september. WSB does not have as much power on GME as you think except increasing the premiums on options.
Wouldn't call it safe. Friday was in inside day, and FAANG as a whole has been shedding the whole year.

I don't understand Cramer when he says he doesn't understand what Palantir does. Information about Palantir has been pretty frequently exchanged in WSB and easily available on Google. Palantir literally mooned to $30 from $18 on NOVEMBER 25TH. It's nearing two months window period. It doesn't make sense for Cramer to refuse to talk about PLTR for a whole month+ when he's had so much time to research it. Dude's obviously lying about still not knowing about what PLTR does when he visits WSB so much. Bet he's scraping up as much shares as he can.

If he is on board GameStop now, and GameStop was able to give him 3 board seats without much of a fight, I think they are really willing to listen to Cohen. 

Since Cohen made Chewy, and did awesome, I think he will do the same for GameStop.

Dude just look up a margin interest loan. If he’s approved for said interest rate for value in shares he’s going to borrow less than the max borrow. Usually 2-8%. His drawdown if the stock tanks would need to be a massive crater in order for him to sell - the bank only has rights to the allocated value + interest to cover the loan.

I think you guys need a situation where shorts cover but no more shorts step right back in for this to happen.

sweet, **your right!** Throw me some meaningless cash.
Interesting thanks pal. If I may then approach you with a query of mine currently. The current GME chart is aligning with the VW squeeze in a really uncanny way. Additionally a lot of squeeze like action occurs after a sharp drop in price and then an explosion up, as with VW. It seems to me like what you are saying would happen either way? It’ll go up and then come down and then go way up. Is there a scenario where it doesn’t drop before this hypothetical squeeze to what ever crazy 3 digit price is getting thrown around here?
Will drive tons of press for the company
Dislike 👎 your opinion. It was a fantastic movie!
You could sell some of the options and exercise the rest. That’s better if you end up with more shares.

Edit: oh it’s just one option, then exercise it if you have the cash
Most ranges predicting when **the big squeeze** is going to happen are 3 days- 3 weeks. 

In my eyes, ATM calls for 2/19 are the best way to go. 

I’m sitting on 50x 2/19 GME $35c.
Thank you

Margin Call was a shitty movie imo. The whole fucking thing is just people vaguely talking about some bad financial thing that's about to happen
its litteraly one talking website
No. I ain’t buying this shit
It think a way to think about it is when you buy lots of stuff scale of economy can go the other way, because you run out of good deals and have to start taking worse deals.

So because GME is shorted over 100% total shares available if I've been reading right. (plus some of these shares are locked and unable to be sold)

Basically the general idea is if you had to buy enough shares for their bets against GME they would need to come to all the retards here with their offers at 690.420 and be forced to buy it with nothing else left for sale.

But I'm still putting on my diaper with 10 shares and along for the ride.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I’m optimistic about green energy such as ICLN and stuff but I may have to rotate out of some of my more bolder calls for more realistic positions if this next week goes poorly (and by realistic positions I mean GME OTM calls and shares)  GME TO THE MOOOOOOON🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I actually have been letting myself get assigned because I've had high confidence in my ability to buy back below the strikes I sell. ZNGA usually doesn't move too wildly and is a good one. BB is also good but has gone a little nuts recently. AR is one I'm watching but doesn't have weeklies.

There isn't, the supply deficit that was already in place only got worsened by COVID shutdowns and now the buying on spot by Cameco, Kazatomprom and Orano.

Yes, new contracts will help price discovery, but a slow upswing in prices is expected as contracts take long to negotiate and idled supply comes back online. The general consensus is that is will run somewhere into 2025, but if hedge funds or other financial institutions decide to do the same as in 2007 (buying up physical uranium) there will be a more parabolic spike and drop which might take place as soon as 2022 or 2023.

The fundamentals are in place, it is time to let them play out and see what kind of bull market we will see.
Holy shit u must be new here... All time high

https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/articles/more-money-less-problems

> Back in March 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic was just beginning and the shelter-in-place orders brought the economy to a screeching halt, a quirky-but-clever idea to save the economy made its way up to some of the highest levels of government. Congresswoman Rashida Tlaib proposed an ambitious relief bill to keep the country’s metaphorical lights on: recurring payments to people to help them stay afloat during the crisis. And the way Congress would pay for it? By minting two platinum $1 trillion coins. (You read that right). 

>In this episode, we take a jaunt through the evolution of our currency, from the gold-backed bills of the 19th century, to the most powerful computer at the Federal Reserve. And we chase an idea that torpedoes what we thought was a fundamental law of economics. Can we actually just print more money?

So this is just wrong.
The number of float shares are those not held by ppl who can't sell without a form (ie, owners of the company). Aka those tradable.

A short occurs when someone borrows a float share and sells it with a promise to pay it back later (and pays a daily fee). This becomes a shorted share and is sold to someone. It counts as one share, but its ownership is a bit weird (regarding dividends but that's whatever atm).

Every time a share is shorted there is now one more shorted share (and it's still in the float pool). So if 200% of float is shorted, that means that every share  in the float pool has been borrowed and sold short an average of TWO TIMES (probably at different price points). That means that two times the available float pool needs to be bought by the shorters in order to cover their debts.
I already forgot my 10% loses yesterday... Wish it wasn’t a three day weekend... 😞
With enough buying, anything is possible, but I think we would need new option strikes purchased into with new money. The current ramps only push this to max mid to high 50s, and really only easily to low 40s. Beyond that, it's a heavy lift. I don't think these shorts are so easily squeezed.  An outside view of this would be that though WSB is large, it's still a spontaneously organized retail group, and prone to profit taking and moving on to the next thing if gains stop happening.

"This eighty year old is comma die if he gets corona. And let's face it, way too many old people have gotten corona. But if we vaccinate him there's a 5% chance of fever. Zoomers can shrug that off, but he's got a 10% chance of dying."

If everyone involved knew the associated risks and still agreed, then that's fine. Tragic, yes, but a known risk that was deemed acceptable.
LOL cohen doesnt own nearly enough to make the difference here.

Now I know you are delusional and have no idea what you're talking about because you are saying retail wont paper hand when most will sell from a 10$ price jump. we can touch 60-70 sure. but anything above that you are just asking to lose money

Candidate Biden signaled that he was for decrim, but decrim and legalization are two very different things especially when it comes to weed companies having access to banking. On the other hand, candidate Biden made fun of millenials for thinking they had it rough and now he's on board with student loan debt forgiveness so who the fuck knows? If he's smart he pushes for legalization in 2022 to boost the midterms elections. Actual federal legalization I think happens in the runup to 2024 election.
Is the pump sustainable? Not forever. It’s a squeeze, will obviously drop after the pump and shorts have to cover.

The announcement of the board shuffling and Cohen and his 2 colleagues joining was recent news. Happened on Monday. Then the managers sold em later in the week.

If the majority of shorts actually covered it would go above $100.  Not sure they’ll actually cover anytime soon though.

I'm in puts only and not also calls because I think we are at prices that will bring shares to sell out of the woodwork, think the margin requirement change WILL have a dampening effect, and think that if we aren't up, people will monetize calls which sends it down. I also think when the ENTIRE wall of WSB is all GME, the level of investment this sub is going to contribute will begin to taper. And, I think at this price level, this will be seen as a juicy short by large hedge funds like Melvin that can put a lot more than the 55m they did at it. Feels like a push down is very possible after such a run. I'd dare not short this in the 20s though.
Get over to "Account Details," and scroll to the bottom. Look at the account type.
If I was in Melvin's shoes and not totally retarded to understand GME is now not going bust I would buy all the calls I can get my hands to cover my short positions, then when I'll have enough I would use these call to cover.

The squeeze would happen but it would be the people on the other side of these calls who would get fucked

You're mistaking my point; I didn't say DFV expected it to happen, **I said that people would make up the legend that he knew it would happen**, that is, his bet on the value play of GME which may have netted him a few hundred percent was definitely not supposed to make him a millionaire let alone a multi- without the sheer force of luck. 

Without everything that did trip up for GME in an alternate universe he's posting gains of maybe 5x and we are all star-eyed but okay with it.

IF a short squeeze happened, those with the calls would reap the most tendies. I would be surprised if the retarded WSB autists running the show weren't all in on some calls while telling the sheeple to buy up the stock to squeeze it for them.

Honestly this would leave a better aftertaste than subway.
I thought it made sense at $5 and even at $9 and $10 to shoot for a turn-around getting into the low 20s. I don't think this price is value anymore.

I'm concerned that Cohen may be thinking this is a growth turn-around as opposed to a cash-cow turnaround. I'm confident growth turn-around is wrong. I think cash-cow turnaround would be dope. Put on some cheap debt, dividend like crazy, play hardball on leases, get competent at ecommerce distribution, retain locations that are effective local publishing for the large publishers and get great concessions to do launch events, etc. It's not clear to me he's really thinking that way. Some of the language in his letter felt overly growthy, and I hear comments here that I know are some combination of impossible/insane/unaffordable/unaligned, like "Buy steam"
My target is $420.69 at least. If shorts need to cover from longs, and there aren’t enough longs, we can literally set ANY price we want if they want to exit. Why settle for less

I've been thinking about this more and I think restricting/removing margin will have short term bullish but long term will limit the short squeeze duration/magnitude. I'm going to go through all my reasoning here so it's going to get a little long and rambly so **TLDR; shorts are forced to cover pushing price up, but no more shorts can enter to fuel further squeeze.**

- The first question is, why are banks increasing margin requirements or removing margin altogether? 

There are two possible answers. Either the banks can't find the shares or they're trying to protect themselves from potential losses. Not being able to acquire shares seems unlikely, if that were the case we should be seeing low availability and high interest [which just isn't there.](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME) People assuming banks are worried about their clients money are wonderfully optimistic but woefully naïve. You can take your account from 100k to zero and the bank won't blink. What they're worried about is you taking your account from 100k to -100k and can't pay it back. 

- So the banks are protecting themselves. But from what? 

The longs, with 75% margin requirement, would have to take 75% losses before losses exceed their collateral, and after that their losses are capped. For a GME bull that entered at 35$ that means a share price of < $8.75. **Shorts, on the other hand, have their losses exceeding collateral at any price > $26.25 (assuming 35$ entry) are exposed to potentially unlimited losses.** 

- Ok so banks are limiting their indirect exposure to shorts by restricting or removing client's margin. Why does this matter? Aren't most shorts institutional and therefore not affected by margin requirements?

It's true, most of the short volume is big players, but there is a large amount of retail shorts as well. Not only will you have contrarians looking to capitalize off the correction, you'll have all the boomers and casual investors who see Cramer, CNBC, and SA articles predicting the fall. The assumption that most retail shorts are in puts I think is false. If you ask anyone on WSB they would probably make that play, but most retail investors aren't degenerate retards. Most are boomers who favor slow steady growth and get hard thinking about their 2% dividend from MCD. When they see Cramer railing millennials for taking some deadbeat stock through the roof, they log into fidelity or schwab and sell shares short. They're not on RH blowing their retirement on puts at 30+% premium.

- Boomers short. Banks restricting margin. What happens from here?

Last week we saw Schwab increase margin requirements first to 100% and then eliminated it altogether. Fidelity increased their requirements from 70 to 75%. Rumors are IKBR were planning to do the same. It's important to note that while removing margin does decrease bank's indirect short exposure, it has the possible effect of triggering a short squeeze if too many clients are forced to close their positions at once. That might explain why IKBR didn't end up changing their margin requirement on the same day as Schwab, and why these changes haven't been widely publicized by the banks themselves. So lets assume that banks take a gentle approach, progressively rising margin requirements before removing margin altogether. This forces some longs and shorts out of their positions over time as they become too high for the trader. But there's an interesting difference when the longs are forced to cover vs. the shorts. Say I'm long 200 shares of GME, 100 bought on margin. If the margin requirement increases from 75% to 100%, I can sell 12.5 shares and I now have enough collateral to cover the remaining position. If I'm short 100 shares with 75% collateral and the requirement goes to 100%, and I close part of the position with my collateral, my margin requirement will decrease but my collateral will decrease by an equal amount. **This means that the traders who forced out of long margin positions will only have to close a portion of their position while those forced out of shorts will have to close the entire position.** Moreover, given the recent price increase, it's likely that on average the shorts will need to cover more collateral than the longs. So **shorts are more likely to be in financial distress and will have to close large proportions of their positions than longs.** The overall effect is net buying.

- Short squeeze intensifies. Retail shorts forced out.

At this point in the lifecycle of a short squeeze with the stock running to new highs you typically have more and more short pressure- old shorts double down, new shorts see Cramer having a seizure and get fomo, some retard checks RH and sees a giant green dildo he doesn't agree with. This can potentially start the lifecycle over, if a catalyst can force this next generation of shorts out. **By limiting retail shorting, big banks are effectively turning off the gas for squeeze continuation down the line.** 

I think that's it. Went a little overboard here, might end up posting it as it's own post. Let me know if you disagree with any points here.

No one planned it to surge this far this fast, that was technical factors around the gamma hedging/short covering. It's already in an unnaturally levitated zone vs the normal rollout of the story. Doesn't mean it cant go a lot higher though, but this is not a 'natural' place for a stock in this situation and story to be. Very unique circumstances have been created.

He laid out the TRUTH about the shorts. This is just the beginning and it really starts to show by catching the attention of media to the likes of your boy Cramer Bloomberg Barrons among others. Wait till people that were ignorant start to realize (besides us WSB retards) that GME is truly a value play and pile on top of Cohen saving his extra 7% dry powder to hit the shorts right in the feels. Not even talking about positive catalysts coming in the next days/weeks because we are witnessing RC Is moving fast in executing his strategy as he intended all along. Hence the price movement we saw last week. 
Wait until it hits $60, you will spit 2-3 DDs a day on how the stock could go either way 😉

There's this thing called money and some people have a lot of it, so they get to use it for nefarious purposes. Other people have not a lot of it, so they are willing to do tremendously evil things to get it.  


Even if we didn't have money and just had food and water supplies, you could apply the same formula.
Whoa, this is a big deal.  I cannot tell you how frustrating it can be to order PC parts off the internet.  Package delays, damaged product. Or it just doesn't work and you have to go through the hassle of returning the DOA product for a refund and wait another week for your part to arrive while your brand new partially finished PC collects dust.

There are no in store retailers near me that sell parts and i'm forced to go through someone like Amazon.  I've been itching for a large retailer where i can just walk in and pick my parts at the store and build my new computer THAT DAY.

Fucking hell, i'm getting hard at the though of it.  I don't think people realize how many cities across America don't even have a microcenter or anything of the like they can just walk into.

There is a massive untapped market of retail buyers itching for something like this and they don't even know it yet.  Who knows, 4 or 5 years from now instead of kids lining up to buy the next gen consoles, they will be lining up at gamestop to build their first computer.

Alright, this is misleading (not blaming you, since I’ve seen this going around for some time). 150MM shares shorted doesn’t mean 250MM available shares in your example. At any point in time there will be at most 100MM shares available. When you lend your shares, your shares are not “available” anymore unless you get them back from the short seller. In this case (lending your shares) you actually don’t own any shares, but instead you own a promise from the short sller that you’ll get some shares back in future. You can theoretically buy back that promise as a short seller, but in that case you wouldn’t be trading any actual shares.

In fact, the whole concept of “synthetic” shares as stated here is misleading (I know some educated folks have also been making this mistake, so I don’t blame you), the shares that people buy from the short sellers are not synthetic, it is quite the opposite: the shares that the lender owns after lending out shares are the “synthetic” ones.

So, if the people who bought the shorted shares and didn’t lend them out aren’t willing to sell anything, there are no shares available for the short sellers to give back to their lenders if they demand it, given that other folks who also lended out shares don’t technically own any shares to give to the short sellers.

I hope this helps clarifying things a bit!

It's not really a dangerous game of chicken as cash covered, but you need to mind your total exposure to GME, and figure out which view you hold more strongly - it's either that the stock is going to the moon, or it's stable and gradually up at this price. If it's the latter, by all means sell those puts. If its to the moon, go buy the stock.

Thanks for this - it's very informative and I'm still wrapping my head around the technicalities, but I have a couple of questions:

* If you feel that there will be volatility both ways then why not buy both call and put (maybe longer dated) and play it both ways? IV will be relatively less so you sell the ones that end up making money and average down on the losing position, then sell that when the stock goes the other way.

I guess my question is that considering the sentiment around the stock, why are you *only* betting against it? With options, particularly when you mentioned that there is high IV (which there is)?

I sold covered calls last week (1/15 40C) which went ITM a couple of times, because I saw how high the premiums were. I haven't bought any options but if I do, I'll likely be buying July or further out.

I'm holding onto the stock for now (not margined), and playing around with options to see if a little extra money can be made there.

The institutions are only trying to trade the IV (implied volatility), they do this by Delta hedging. When they sell calls (call options have a positive delta), they need to buy stocks to make their overall position delta neutral. This means they make money if the realised volatility is less than the implied volatility, and their profit is not affected by the direction the stock moves.

Dude I’m sorry but I just totally disagree with you he definitely has to be using some BIG gains to help that company out. ALSO the government has awarded him money for his Space X company. So it’s probably not out of neccisity
It’s GME - always a possibility to drop.  But always the possibility to 🚀.  That’s what you’re getting.  I went in initially in October at 1g then slowly started avg down my calls.  Used my other investments to keep funding it. By end of November I was 33 contracts in.  Rolled some out to April’s.  The past wk has made me believe that with every drop, this rides just going to get better and better
Kind of like a double negative.  Makes sense.

Hey David Faber!!.........FUCK YOU MAN!!!!!
You can do that, but there is a chance of more downward movement before upward. You might be better off seeing a limit order at like $30 so it instantly buys if it dips them just keeping a close eye on it Tuesday to decide when to get in. That's what I'm doing but I have 70% of my gme money in shares already. So if it instantly spikes and I can't get more oh well. If it drops I'll buy more.

Yeah you’ve got it. A margin account allows you to technically “borrow” the money while the funds are settling and allows you to truly day trade. You’re not charged margin interest for this like you would be if you actually borrowed money to buy additional stock that exceeds your cash in the account so you’re not trading on margin. 

However if your account has less than $25k total value you’re limited to 3 day trades in five business day period. If you’re above $25k in a margin account you can do unlimited day trades.
Yeah I don’t think RH gives access to OTC markets unfortunately. Makes me more bullish. When this lists on the NASDAQ ( or possibly NYSE... lol) it’ll only moon more.
So how blood red is Tuesday gonna be? Stimulus couldn't even give market a pump end of last week. Market had plateaued for a few days before that too. Definitely seems like very bearish sentiment
Also the first time the play has been to own and hold shares, rather than buy otm calls and let them expire worthless
Webull has you on a cash account by default. They just enforce good faith violations if you purchase with unsettled funds.

So the funds they give you for Instant deposit are considered unsettled and you have to wait t2 to sell your shares or you take a GoodFaith Violation and get 90day time out.

I mean I'm not a big gambler (did I say that out loud?) But the options for sports betting in Canada blow. Minimum 3 games on proline? Come on! Not everyone wants to bet on games on the regular, some people just wanna bet on game 7 of the cup or whatever. I think our government finally realized they were missing out on big money cause bettors were using out of country websites like bet365. I think SCR will be good for Canada, but I dunno how they'll compete in the US

I wondered about that-Whether people have some 'reason' for what they do..I wondered last week WHY Chen? Is'nt more VOCAL with all the exciting new 'stuff' 'behind Blackberry? Why after the gov breach? and just all the exciting things that are promising about the Company-Why more folks are back in ??? another decade...Is Chen silent for a reason? I do not mean Silent-but just-I see so much commentary that shows me most are clueless about the 'new blackberry'.....How did(or where). you find out about the bonus-That? is the kind of info that adds a timeline in my mind.

I’d say 45-50 is safe bet on Tuesday if more shorts have to cover considering uptick rule in effect. You can see $100+ if all the institutions  and retail holding GME just don’t fuckin sell. Look at what losing 5% of the short interest did to the price and then realize they’re still shorting like 120% of the float at least. Of course, you sell on the way up.
Skyrocket when shorts have to cover. You see what it did to the price when they started to cover when a few big whale buy orders came in.
Gotta love the ethos!
“Suppose a company has 100 million shares outstanding, and 60 million of them are with institutions that participate in stock lending programs, making the shares easy for broker to locate.

Shorts borrow the 60 million shares and sell them. Suppose 40 million of the sold shares end up with institutions that participate in stock lending programs. Shorts borrow those and sell them again. And again. And again.”

That’s how you end up with 100+%
What’s that mean ?

so there are a ton of options expiring friday. Less than last week, but a lot.  At the end of the week, dealers will either be net short or net long stock w/ regards to the expiring options. As those positions are closed and rolled (or not rolled) it will tend to cause reverse action to whatever the dealers position is. In the case we are at $15, that's a ton of net buying. If we are at $60, it's a ton of net selling.

100 shares is a good position! I’m not “loaded” by any means (not compared to people making hundreds of thousands on calls) but I’d consider 100 shares a serious investment for most people.

I will say this regarding DFV: He didn't expect to happen what just happened, not half a year ago.
He did tell us what he thought and how he came to yolo on GME. So while the ludicrous gains he has (even just the $2M in cash are positively ludicrous) can be safely attributed to luck, there is the fact that he had done his research and we told us why he thought GME would rise.
Did he know GME would rebrand and Cohen would take interest? No. Did he have good reason to believe that GME would rise, netting him not a guaranteed twentybagger (that's his current cash alone, after all) but a likely modest increase? Yes, that he did.

For lots of other things you're spot on though, it's just that he specifically is a bad example.

Imagine being Melvin Capital, the most pathetic  company in the world at the moment.

Instead of doing good with their billions under management, they do the most disgusting and vile shit. It's time to put them out of fuckin business. They need to lose every single penny under management.
Probably sleep deprivation and/or shrooms.
How does a market which is extremely overbought react to bad news like a global pandemic? It crashes...swift and hard.

Short squeezes are the same, with people running for the exit all at once to stop their losses. Only in this case they run to buy and the stock crashes up.

Those are really different things, and you are concentrating risk. Thing is, if we breach 30, it can start to fall kind of quickly both by this sub freaking out, as well as the MMs dumping due to their negative gamma around 30 (and it could be worse if a lot of new puts were written last week). 

Anyway, to sell a cash covered put you are basically saying that you think vol is overpriced AND the stock will go up, so you are effectively increasing your long. I guess the question is which belief is stronger. If you believe more on stock up than on vol overpriced, you'd just buy the stock more.

Thanks as well!  Regarding bullet #2, if you sell the call option contract and are ITM, with the following scenario:
Underlying stock is $50 per share, you get a call option for $5 per share and buy 1 contract, so your premium = $500.  Strike price is $75.

Now, it expires in 1 month; 2 weeks in, the underlying stock gets to $80.  So now you're ITM, if you choose to sell your call option contract and not exercise it, how much would you earn, how is that calculated?

This is the way.
$420.69, $694.20, and $1000 sell orders reporting in, sir!  Make sure to actually place the sell orders everyone - if those are the only shares left on sale when the short squeeze comes and they need to close out their positions, well, then the value of GME is whatever shares are on sale.  Put in the orders GTC as high as you want, but minimum $420.69 for sure

And of course, 💎🤲🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

No clue but set a sell order at 420.69
And 363 less than 420 👀👀👀
14:30 (2:30 pm), but this Monday market is closed as Holiday.
I've had a cumulative return of 20% so far after running it for 2 months. That's lower than it could be because I haven't been doing it at the same scale/risk level. Both of which I have increased after the first month. If you can find high volume tickers that don't move much and have weekly options you can control your risk more and run multiple wheels. 

It's really fun.

I did write this.

Graduated USC, ran the accounting department of a local commercial real estate company until 2020 until i realized commercial real estates future looked pretty bleak and left to develop low income housing projects with my partner. This gave me a lot more free time to delve into stocks and I really like what I see from Fubo. We do a lot of DD in commercial real estate and I was always taught that it’s more important to look for reasons not to buy a property.

My DD just comes from being obsessed in finding as much about a company as I can. I scour twitter and stocktwits for leads to research and fact check, and in doing so I find and connect missing pieces. My process is to try and find anything to convince myself NOT to invest in a hype stock such as this one, and so far the only red flags I see are those typical of high growth startups that aren’t profitable yet. This always comes with scale, and Fubo is on the way.
You are my hero, 7 figures here I come 🚀🚀🚀🗽🗽🚀🚀🗽🚀🚀

As someone that has build a couple computers before (nothing huge but I know the basics) I can assure you that this market is prime for disruption. Pc building isnt that bad actually but most people dont want to get into it and therefore order a pre build computer online. The problem is that there are hundreds of sites and its very confusing for people to decide which specs to pick. Because of this you have a 90% chance to get ripped off. I seriously believe gamestop could be a mini microcenter but not only for pc builders, but for regular gamers too. 
They could even combine this with their own digital store, like steam/epic games. You can buy digital games, order pc/console accesories, read gameinformer to stay up to date, have special deals for powerup members and buy digital DLCs or order fysical collectibles from games you play a lot. ALL IN ONE APPLICATION. 
I am just thinking out loud here but everytime I read something like this my dick gets hard and my brain is going sicko mode. Sorry for this long, probably stupid comment but im about to increase my buy order for tuesday 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

i REALLY liked this post and your last post that you linked. as a GME bull, i appreciate you showing a complete picture and not being bias to one side or another.  i got a question and you seem like a good person to ask. 

let’s assume i have a high risk tolerance...as evidence by the fact that i have over 12K in shares with a $19 cost basis. on tuesday or wednesday i want to buy ~3K more shares but figured....hey why not sell some cash secured puts instead with a strike of $30 and collect about $6K in premium. just want to get your thoughts on this strategy.  thank you 🙏.

Really appreciate the effort and detail. I caught your last post and played it off against some of the other bullish analysis. I felt it was too bearish but had enough validity for me to get out of the 1/15s Thursday. I didn't get the best exit I could have but it definitely was a safer option, and better than Friday close.
Will heed the same this week coming and be checking any updates you add to this.

Bigger holders wanting to fuck the shorts could call back their shares. I'd say given the payoff for stock holders creating a squeeze, they'd be highly incentivized to do so. In any other case they may not care if their shares are lent out.

I don't have an answer to your question, but I do have something to say about the future. If this takes off as hard as we are trying to push it to (420.69 and beyond), the stock market and maybe even the world is never going to be the same again... Could you imagine what thousands maybe even a million of retards would do with millions of dollars, each, in their wallets?

Going to be a lot of angry 🌈🐻 that's for sure. 

But it could always bit us in the ass too, can't rule out the possibility! However, all the numbers seem to be in our favor, GME's float is at 250% and short% was at 94.6% (might be off by 1 or 2 %). 

What does this mean? 💎🖐️🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

$60 is a good price point if you wish to trim.

$70+ is my top end range for now. I feel 5bn market cap is fair value with all we know.

$100+ 2022 seems like a no brainer. There's so many reasons for 7bn market cap next year and it will become very obvious to the market by 2H21 after Cohen reveals his plan and starts to show some results.

Don't let people shame you for that. You made a shit-ton of profit off that trade and you moved it into a much safer investment while at the same time helping squeeze the shorts. You played it perfectly (of course I think this way because I did the exact same thing with my calls going into shares).

GME hasn't done 10x. That would put the price at $200, assuming you make $20 the starting point for the squeeze. And we don't if it has even started yet. $30 - $35 could be the starting point. We don't know if the run-up this past week was from news on Cohen and his cohort both joining the board and buying a ton of shares, or the beggining of shorts covering. But in any case we're no where near 10x.

So again, yes, I was incorrect in my understanding of the situation and you are correct.

My intention was not to spread bad information, at all. If anything my goal was to help the GME cause because hit pieces like this one put out by marketbeat.com can cause a negative reaction that’s not warranted.

Stupid question- if the price shoots up to $300-$400 can Melvin even afford to buy the shares?
It’s a great political play. Democrats have campaigned on police reform, and it can be argued that AAXN’s products help facilitate that. Body cams + “non-lethal” tasers instead of guns + half their business is a SaaS play, which I love.
Just checked sec filings. 3 GME directors sold almost half of their stocks on 01/15. It’s not the guy who was forced to sell. These guys had around 10k-20k stocks each.
It's very interesting because they dive deep into a lot more detailed information about Gamestop and the board. These guys have been very bullish on GME for a while now, I can only imagine how happy they are now. 

Worth a listen imo if you're invested or interested.

If this pops, can we all coordinate sending dildos and other 🌈 sex toys to Melvin's NYC office (attention Gay-briel Plotkin)?
Make a video of the board room at Melvin yearling at a guy trying to convince them to settle
It's very important to understand that when Melvin does a short sale on the equity they are essentially selling non existant shares to then open market trying to drive the price down...its an expensive manipulation strategy. Also, when they sell puts, MMs need to hedge which also drives the price down.

TLDR, there is no price target. If we all put sell limit orders at 420, then that's the price target. That's the price Melvin has to pay to close their shorts.

to all of you who are thinking about selling GME, trust the process. A couple weeks ago, people bought at $22 and sold for a massive loss. Yesterday several people bought at $38 and probably sold at $32 for a massive loss. Those paper handed pussies could have been in the deep green right now, but they have no faith. Even if you bought at $42, you will be in the green soon. DIAMOND HANDS 💎

Bought 25 GME shares Friday at 3, looking to add 25 more Tuesday at open or is it too late
huh?
I just wanted to say thanks a bunch for you last post. The talk of a big down on Friday spooked me, so I set up a little hedge for myself. Made a little bit of cash, and I was able to roll it into a few more shares towards the end of the day.

This post is great too, even if it does stress me out a little bit.

Idk if the guy realizes the reason a squeeze happens is because demand is astronomically higher than supply of shares. Why he thinks an offering at that point would be stupid is beyond me. Then again I’m retarded.

I’m not the best at understanding the market but if someone were to buy an offering at say $40 a share doesn’t that mean their shares will go nuts after the shorts cover? Why wouldn’t someone buy an offering?

There are metrics for it in place. The issue is that with the new volume of retail investors, things may act a bit differently since people investing with $50 aren't going to care that the giant market is going down if $BB isn't plummeting.
Whats that
This is definitely an outlier though

Sexy fucker
Preach. OP studied finance and skipped their macro Econ class. Even if it’s not real growth, IE it’s just inflation, I’m not about to miss the train. Stocks will go up because putting your money in your mattress earns more than debt, Biden is gonna give america $2T of cash via various means, investing in emerging markets is meh (I like it but racist boomers don’t), and we printed $4T in Q1/Q2, and finally the fed never actually unwinds its balance sheet. You’re playing in 2008, but times have changed OP. I lost $50k shorting the market after the initial March drop, because fundamentally, it should have kept falling, but fundamentals are now meaningless. Get on board, buy some hype stocks, embrace inflation and party. Roaring 20s is back 100 years later.

I'll sell you 5 for $1000

Sold!
I used to do pennystocks was down 90% because of them losers.
I bought BB after seeing a post about it on here and I'm currently up 16%.

I've been lurking for a few months and have seen the following stocks all get posted on here and go up shortly after: PLTR, KTOS, BB, CRSP, GME, AMD and at least 3-4 more but that's as many recent searches as Freetrade will show me.

Every single one of them has gone up by a considerable amount after it was posted here. AMD and PLTR are currently down from when I last searched from but those are older ones that have had more time to come back down from the peak after it was posted.

&#x200B;

Following these general rules: 

Actual reasoning about why it will go up in the post.

No comments about stuff that OP has overlooked, or OP answering those comments and allaying those fears.

Lots of people replying that they agree/are buying.

Lots of rocket emojis (yes I know this one sounds retarded but hey it appears to work).

&#x200B;

If those rules are followed I have yet to see any stock that was posted on WSB that has not gone up after the post.
Yes, all in GME


Position 20.6 shares @ 37.64 $GME
you do realize iv is so high if gme stays flat you will get doubly fucked right?

You wrote this report?

What’s your process for DD? Is it strictly from googling FUBO? What’s your background? I’m impressed with this report and just curious how you found such good information. Are you in the industry? Whenever I try to get more info on a company, all I see is the same basic info from seeking alpha, market watch... all the redundant and useless top hits from google. The investor websites are equally useless. Any advice on how do more thorough research?
I just don't get it why they have the dollar requirement even there. Anyways I appreciate you responding. My acct still shoes 45% Marg req.and I'm trying to do maths on a 85% increase. Like the way I understand it, if that were to happen, the cost basis of the original buy will need 85,% equity in the acct. And not on the market value, or "dollar requirement " column they have there. Seems confusing having that there.

I agree with you, I sold my tesla shares days ago. Delusions and infinite greed is the sign of bubble popping soon. Even the next door Jimmy's dog would buy tesla right now and that's a red flag. When it pops tho, I'm going to buy it again.
Same but I think game might take a week
An easier way to understand shorting is simple 1 - 1 = 2.

So here's the math:

\+1 to the person who actually bought the stock. The stock is owned.

\-1 to the person who *borrows* the stock. The stock is owned.

2 from the fact that now one share has two owners, but that won't last, as the person who borrowed it needs to give it back eventually. What a short squeeze represents is when the price goes way up and the buyback cost of the stock to return it to the original owner is worth more, not less, than the price borrowed at meaning that the lender wants it back. That's it!
I hope you don’t get a 3090 then, that shit is a tank
buy shares and hold them, no one is going to buy your contracts
Yea every time we hit 375 we rallied this appears to be  floor.

If every time you see the words "hard as fuck" you think about dicks, that says a lot about you.

It will probably shoot uo right at open, with everyone else buying in over the long weekend. Wait until half half hour after market opens when there's usually a bit of a dip.

They want to create an ecosystem (IVY) running on every car. Basically the Android for cars.  The car doesn't have to run on BlackBerry QNX, it will be available for every car.

With this ecosystem comes an App Store, Data Analytics, Fancy UI.

BlackBerry is very good at creating a secure OS (the QNX has all levels of certifications) and is good at the 'lower level' stuff for cars, Amazon is very good at Data Analytics, Fancy UI and has the capability to set up something massive like this ecosystem (and an App Store).

The effort will be 50/50, the investment will be 50/50.
You act like anybody on this sub will be holding GME in 5-10 years.
Yeah I'm looking into doing that on PLTR
Bigly true.  I use mine to hammer in the stakes on my tent that I live in and have terrible luck with women.
> Cohen has a bad reputation because of his plan to shutter most of the brick and mortar stores.

To be fair they have waaaaay too many stores, when you hear stories of two gamestops in a single mall then they should be shutting stores, they are as bad as starbucks.
What? One share every hour they work? idk - most Americans would complain about not getting actual money.
I have a couple of leaps in arkk
I think so since they give you instant deposits, but haven't researched them.
What’s your favorite movie and why?
That might be it. To be fair world is a small place in the end, especially when you're in the finance business and one of the faces of 'burn' the shorts campaign. Dr.Burry (aka the original autist) gives fuck all but a small fund manager making enemies? Major risk that does not apply to WSB I suppose as anonymous crowd is safe in numbers. "Retards together strong" kinda gets a new meaning don't you think? 

In regard to misinformation, it's frustrating on one hand but on the other... brilliant. I don't need more confirmation bias DD wise, but media/experts trying to lie to my face? Bots trying to rip internet communities apart? (it's a board on stocktwits for god sake!) Reeks of desperation.

I was thinking about this as a play with BB since Sony is getting the BB software integration. If Tuesday or Wednesday goes well with GME , I’m all in on BB shares and will throw some money into some SNE long calls .

Shit posting aside, thinking about buying 100 shares of icln and selling July deep otm calls. 45c were going for $2.58 eod Friday. That's an immediate 8.3% return and a 50% return if exercised.

I know this sub is often split on the boomer-esque nature of ccs but seems like a good play.
Aren’t they in talks to partner with BB? This makes me very excited, I’m buying more on Tuesday 😂

So much research and you either on purpose or ignorance forgot to mention the most important part of their business model?

 * They are *not* SaaS. Why does that matter because of cost of delivery. They’re a bespoke packaged software house.

 * Each software solution they sale must be customized and professional services involved. In essence they are a consultancy.

Why this matter _against_ the bull thesis? Because they won’t be able to grow at the multiple at which it stands. The multiple it’s currently enjoying is hype, mono, etc. but unlike other software companies they won’t be able to grow at the clip the shares are priced at.

In your comparison, you compare it to Alteryx, and plantir has a 6X larger market cap with only a small fraction of the revenues.

TL;DR: incomplete analysis leads to errors in conclusion.

Thanks and sorry I should have been more clear. I was wondering if market makers would always be available to buy even if the price goes insane but am now thinking that might not be the case because the NYSE is an auction market. 

But having said that, if we assume the shorts (for some reason) all decide to cover or are forced to, wouldn't there be more than enough buyers for each seller if the short interest is more than 1?

These are all great points. I've read tons of bear comments, but they're all just "PrIcE iS hIgH, eAsY ShOrT", and I still don't see any catalyst for this thing to fall yet.

$40 may not even be a crazy price once all the shorts who have artificially pushed the price down are forced to exit, on top of changes RC makes.

I just wish I knew a good price target for when to exit the squeeze if it does pop again. My best indicator to exit is when I see shorts covering, but I worry a lot of that data is trailing, and there will continue to be shorting through the squeeze, just as people buy during crashes.
How about the sleeping snakes and frogs? Did they evict them? Are the environmentalists OK now?

It won't work like you think it will, and you have no idea has small a margin most small businesses run on. Maybe after 10-15 years of living like a pauper trying to pay off loans, buy equipment, trying to build a customer base, you might as a small business owner start doing well. If you're paying 5 workers more than minimum wage, say $10, and a manager $15, now you're mandated by the government to raise everything to $15. Your manager is of course going to demand a raise, so now you have to pay her $18 an hour. So now the government has increased your labor cost by $28 an hour, or $58,240 a year full time. Of course payroll taxes are based on pay so that also goes up, so total increase is probably close to $60,000 a year. As the owner paying yourself $75,000 a year after taxes, the rest going towards keeping the lights on, lease costs, insurance... now what? This is the very real scenario of the majority of small businesses that you apparently don't consider "really a business". The reality is that normal people won't be able to start small businesses, and the only ones that will survive in the new government skewed economy are the rich and the major corporations who can afford to automate. If you don't like big box stores the idea of a mandated $15 minimum wage is literally the worst thing that can happen. Walmart won't be going anywhere, but the mom and pop shop that competes with them will be gone. Your college indoctrination is over Kid; time to wake up to the realities of how an economy really works.
Fuck yeah

May I interest you with some XPEV? Had a 20% pop at the beginning of last week, from which it sold off on weak ass volume, so it has refueled for another big pop next week. I think its a good opportunity, and it is a Gyna play that hedges against US politics.

Well when they take away a considerable large chunk of it (33% where I am) it can hurt
Since you seem to be well read in this, is it possible that those holding shorts/puts could be using a long call straddle to recoup their money and limiting squeeze potential? Maybe I misunderstand that strat, but it seems like a good one to go with since the price is so volatile but not sure if it applys here.
So this dumbass went from short seller, to losing his pants, to now on the GME bandwagon? Fucking boomer.
It can
[deleted]
Well, I don't know if that is a correct paraphrasing. The squeeze is half done which means the price movement from the squeeze is half done but *the whole price movement is not from the squeeze*. That's the important part. You may get a few more dollars out of the squeeze itself, and kudos to you, but honestly at this point I would say that within a week you're genuinely seeing what the market thinks of the actual changes in management and rebranding of the company.

Am I bullish? I don't know. I await? Yeah. Either Cohen will meet his promises (of which is a tall, tall order) or he won't and if he doesn't, he doesn't, that's fine. I would say that you'll make more money holding for a little while until you have to truly trust in the company. Squeezes are very short limited events if they actually occur because forcing someone out of the position is really hard when you're up against billions in capital.

This ain't no Tesla.
I stand corrected you are now down 2 points and counting.

In case you guys were wondering the longer you hold the more interest bears have to pay on the shares they borrowed to sell. Eventually it will no longer be financially smart for them to keep waiting for GME to go back down and they will have to buy shares to cover the ones they borrowed. Fueling a rocket ship. Some of the big bois wanna prove a point that deep pocket boomers arnt afraid of WSB. Momma didn’t raise no paper handed bitch. GME and $BB$ to the fucking moon bois

Also of you sell for a loss and buy it right back at the dip you will be subject to the wash rule and have a higher cost basis than expected. You'd be better off holding and buying the dip (if you can) to lower your cost basis. Either way you're gonna make money

Restricted?
Sir how did this happen
Oh you mean buying a lesser dollar amount of options vs. shares; I see what you're getting at. Still, highly unlikely of a worst-case 90% drop vs. say a 50% drop where shareholder is down $450 and option holder has total loss.
For real. If shorts actually covered in that time we would see spikes of millions in volume. Most spikes were still 6 figures

Nobody can predict that one.

The take is to remind yourself your feelings are irrational not say the other people are dumb.
Does anyone expect this to recover? Im bot sure if its a joke or not.
YES! everyone is absolutely convinced its already died and don't truly see the potential GME has to transition because they really do NOT understand the gaming industry. It's hilariously sad to watch.

>Losing $3k today in TSLA and NIO was not fun. But I also bought into GME. So if I crash, I’m doing it with my WSB homies.

Ditto, but closer to -$40k. Can't wait for the correction to the correction.

We actually make money on GME here
Also something to note is bubbles burst after a vertical rally, this trend is seen in South sea, 08 housing, dot com, Japan asset. Now the market could spike 20% from here and I could be totally wrong but I am definitely concerned

Retail is usually the last to enter and first to get wiped out. Depression-era "investing" was eerily similar. Once you start saying this time "it's different," you set yourself up to get fucked up. If you want to be long, consider getting puts as a hedge. It's what a lot of the big boys do. No need to sell everything, when your puts appreciating will outweigh all losses. I'm short-term long, but buy SPY puts here and there to keep up as a hedge whenever i start to get a bit uneasy
Probably up to $27 after open and back down again :(

If you rlly learned your lesson, youd put the options bullshit aside, and allocate all dollar bills into shares. NOAOOOAAWWWW
That would be like if we invested in a company and started being like “I think we have a good chance of surprising on earning we have a great product” which arguably is more warranted but still dumb af

Highly doubtful since the market was created by rich white people to help rich white people get rich lol
With 9m you don’t even have to sit in cash to live a kush life. I’d dump it all back into an Index fund and live off the dividends. 1.5% of 9m is 135k a year for doing literally nothing. And that dividend income will historically grow at 7-10% annually so every year your getting a decently large sized raise almost no matter what. After 10 years that 135k will be roughly around 291k annually if the SP earnings grow like they have....and that nest egg will be much MUCH larger.

Hi
I'm not trying to encourage anyone to sell, really. But I am encouraging you to buy the dips with your new additions rather than buy the highs. Just trade strategically. If you want to buy the highs to add momentum, do it with smaller amounts to gauge momentum. If you notice momentum waning, it's ok to lighten up 5-10% and buy the dip back. 

I realize if everyone just keeps shoving money at it it will run over the shorts like an elephant, but if the momentum slows down, buying the dip becomes the better strategy. Can you really have faith that everyone will keep shitting money into this stock? Maybe. But that's harder to believe so it's better to buy the dips and buy smaller amounts on momentum.
That’s what I’m saying you restarted fuck. Now go short Tesla.
So what will happen to my 100 shares on margin at Charles Schwab that I bought at $16? I'll be forced to deposit $1600 or liquidate the position?

Let me guess...you got fired.  Don't worry, there's a dumpster behind Wendy's where you can make some money, $1 per customer.
Oh lol, I think that's from increasing pop. More and more people are coming and not playing along with stonks only go up, but you're right. There are more people talking about puts that I've noticed, but I think that's going with two things

1. People are expecting a bubble pop or market downturn
2. A lot of the puts are bought on stocks that skyrocketed recently

1 is betting on a major event that could be years out. 2 is smarter because major upswings are usually followed by a correction, but they're betting on stocks that people are buying more and more into here.

Either way, stonks always go up, follow the meme stocks, diamond hands, etc. Try not to bet against the stocks people consistently bring up as making them money lol

Great post, wish I read this before I bought some GME shares on margin. I'm comfortable with the company and its future, but now I'm worried about the "those stocks aren't yours" part. Although I understand those shares technically belong to the broker, if I set a very high sell limit order, they won't be able to screw me out of the potential gains, right? Excluding the principle and interest rate that I owe obviously.

I was fiending for it idk why. Something about the smell of a subway shop is intoxicating. I probably go once a year.
I can’t honestly see GME bailing out the shorts quickly when they were just trying to murder the company.

If I was Cohen and were approached by the shorts, I’d let them off, but at a much much higher price. This rewards the loyal investors/share holders and the company gets a huge inflow of capital. Win win for everyone, even the shorts (they won’t have infinite losses).
Oh boy time to buy more GME

They have a $100M shelf offering. It does benefit GME and him by proxy as an investor for the company to get $100M while minimizing the dilution of shares. If this goes parabolic and they sell at $400 that’s only 250,000 shares added. Which is good for long term investors.

Not the best timing for that business model unfortunately.
I shorted before first minor share expansion and made a little money. Made about 300k in the main December lockup, then lost 125k of it holding too long after rolling into short-dated puts to try to squeeze the sellers (Failed, they were smarter than that), then lost another 25k holding long-term puts after. I'm neutral on it now, waiting for an entry. So net profit 150k last year. Was like $25 and $22 puts and stuff into the lockup expiry.  I think the company has nothing, but I also think the stimulus check dip buy is a thing, and need to get the next round of stimulus out of the way before I re-enter. Probably a great short before the April lockup expiry because they'll have so much competition then, and be out of catalysts. Lately they just keep publishing how they have locked in some public utilities. They still haven't announced cable/internet and trash service for the factory, and that's a 20% run right there with their investor base.

Your so evolved!  Thank you my leader for bestowing such many of knowledges onto us dumb sports fans!
Right! Amateurs. I saw a seeking alpha article that said why xpev will surge, and then posted THE SAME DAY was another seeking alpha article saying why xpev will go down. TF
But remember - there's no limit to the number of times you can lose 25% of your portfolio.

I talk about it "with" my wife , meaning I talk about it and she listens because she knows I'm happy to talk about it...but at this point I don't really have anyone to share it with. People don't care as long as it's not their own money engaged. At most, they will care if u do money, but it will just bring jealousy...
Do you think we have time to get in on Tuesday at market open? Or is this rocket gonna be already moving 🚀
If GME dips at all Tuesday Ill add another 1k shares to the 2k I have already. All in.

It would be insane to assume there was no covering when the stock almost doubled in a day.

The guy is a perma bear and gold bull who ironically sells gold. Been saying the same thing about a collapse since forever. Would've missed out on the longest bull run in history listening to him and gold has been a crap investment compared to stocks even with the recent bull run it had.

Anyway, what did he say? Dollar collapse, hyper inflation, end of the country.. buy gold from him?

Goddamnit man. Do you not understand how much money these short positions have? Even if this blows up in their face they will survive as long as they submit soon. We are now well above the short position range, but the SPECIAL part you need to pay attention to is that now there are not enough shares to short. This increases margin cost of the short position and also makes it impossible to double down. The short interest is what is special. Without the ability to create an even larger short at the current price it would just be stupid for these people to not give up and buy to cover and move on to better prospects. They can be prideful and hold as long as they pay the margin interest, but the more attention this gets and the more shares that are bought the dumber Melvin Capital will seem for just not cutting their losses. If you Rich Af would you want to give your money to a company that arrogantly got caught with their pants down by a bunch of autists and then continued to stay in their shitty position?

No shit but Volkswagen is once in a decade because of alot of factors. Short interest wasnt even the biggest reason it went up like that.

It was because one institution owned 80% of the shares. You could have every factor VW did but without that key part its nearly impossible.

Imagine going all in, not any time in the past year where the stock has been hyped daily on this site, rather after it has surged 100pct in 2 days. I just can't fathom the lack of brain cells that most people here display. If there was a contest for how to never make money, this would be a solid entry.

Nope, ill check it out now.
Look at the value of the contract. It possibly is worth more than just the (current share price - the strike price), because it has time and volatility value. So you can instead sell the call, and then buy the share.
If you have to ask then yes

Like everyone else is saying great post, I just don't get how people can say a stock should rise 700% in a year and call it warranted

If I am not mistaken Volkswagen infinity squeeze happened with 13 % of stocks being shorted. We saw a 4x increase from 200$ to 1000$, but now there are how many? 130% stocks shorted? How high can GME go? As I understand 3k might not actually be out of the question?

> There is nothing better than running into a store and just looking at all the different gaming shit they have all over the place. Gamestop is actually an experience especially when you're a kid.

So was Blockbuster, seriously. And like i mentioned, i think the games are great and want to see things to keep that quality. It's just a cool industry, because of the quality of these games, and I'd like to see anything that improves on that experience from a kind of sentimental standpoint. Not sure if that "experience" will be enough to save the brick and mortar locations, though.

I can see where games themselves are going, which is why i'm so interested in anything related to them.

I want to believe, I just don't fully see it yet.
Question is how SUSTAINABLE/STABLE it is. Chinas Economic growth imo is far higher than their potential growth which ain’t good. I think this all ties together with how the bank of China is giving big corps money so they can buyout companies, assets, everything in western countries to ‘diversify’. Even if it’s a company buying, behind it is the Chinese state.

This is what I thought for a while but many of the options selling MMs actually use a gamma hedging strategy when selling weeklies that necessitate purchasing shares to offset their short call delta.

"Delta-Gamma Hedging Definition" https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/deltagamma-hedging.asp

Tldr: if enough degenerates buy OTM calls it creates positive upward drift due to these algorithms. TSLA being Exhibit A for this phenomenon.

Alright... you retards convinced me. Finally going in on GME. Dropping 15K$ on Tuesday. Just can't decide if I should dump it all in at open, wait to buy a dip, or buy some then buy more at a dip... (if there's a dip).

Decision decisions...
As annoying as these clueless boomers are, there are a lot of fucking boomers in the world. Imagine if we actually had the patience to provide them with real DD. They might actually get other boomers to buy in, making the squeeze even a bigger certainty.
You got leaps.  Small period of time?

Be careful calling out WSB, as we might respond with BIG DICK ENERGY
It's about an elementary school dropout that grows up to have DFV hands to the point that he sees the great depression coming and shorts it, making about $15~$20B in today's money from that move alone.

The ending is fitting for WSB.

I'm currently 31, not knowedgable on bonds for the most part but will do some research, will also consider using VSTAX as I am in the US. I really appreciate this advice, I really want to make use of this money and to do it the right way. The YOLO on BB probably wasn't the best move but I didn't go too far into it as an experiment.
[deleted]
Take this shit elsewhere. I’m trying to make money you winey bitch.
if they are short the options (meaning, they sold the options), they can accelerate price changes when price near the strikes of options they wrote, because they have to hedge in the direction of the price action - whether or not they are short a put or short a call, higher price = buy, lower price = sell.
Yeah all about the visa, did you see that Molly’s daughter was arrested, go check out the sub the memes are hilarious
I hate to say it but that’s the boomer sentiment. 

GME has a huge opportunity to turn around and all these boomer shorts keep looking at it and repeating same line thinking they’re more in touch with the digital age. GameStop has so much cash they’re not going BK any time soon. They can bleed out into the foreseeable future if they wanted to just sit on their asses.

Undervalued/suppressed stocks like these are key money makers for investors and retards alike. Even without the upcoming squeeze, GME has a lot of room to grow through e-commerce and specialized repurposed brick and mortar locations. Basically a squeeze with a safety net.
Idk why everyone thinks all bears are the same, I wasn't calling a bubble in 2015 because their wasn't one, but I am now, we have people saying "this time is diffrent" and "following smart money is a mistake" and when a p/e under than 200 is a steal then yea I cant help but call a crash

But sure, buy puts

APHA and TLRY are going to merge very soon making them the largest cannabis company out there. It will also give them a huge start on the US market for when Biden legalizes cannabis. APHA just had a decent earnings report where they continued on the up trend. TLRY earnings are coming out soon I believe.

When APHA and TLRY merge APHA shares will be .83 of a TLRY share. With the current price both of them are trading at though, it means you will actually turn a mad profit at the moment because of how lower priced APHA is.

TLDR: BUY APHA 🚀🚀
I'm digesting it in small pieces because my background info on psychology is so small I have to read a chapter and then go read about 8 other psychology related things lol. About 3/4 through though and it has been wonderful
They merged with Tilray and are retaining APHA management (but will trade under TLRY on the NASDAQ). They bought a microbrewery in Georgia so they are going to do drinky drinks. Something something positive earnings and EBITDA. US Dem sweep should be positive for the canatendies. And something about first mover advantage in the US probably

Can someone clarify why options are bad for the impending short squeeze? I know that part of the rational was that we cannot time short squeezes, but with far out enough strike dates and less capital you get more shares locked up because market makers are required to delta hedge their positions.

When my 300 $50 calls go deep ITM, they lock up 30,000 shares for a fraction of the cost of 30,000 shares.

Gamma squeeze could be the trigger we need, considering what happened with Tesla’s epic run up.

Because you just spammed a bunch of garbage, this meager DD provided more information than you did, if you want people to buy in you need to provide solid points backed by available research, people didn’t buy into GME because of memes but because of well reasoned research saying it was undervalued
So get rid of all GME and BB posts?

I agree, it's a ballsy play, but it has a great risk/reward ratio. In almost all of my speculations, I include a short-term, cheap option play, incase the underlying makes gains earlier than expected. For every ten or so situations like this, I only need one to hit to make it worth it. Thanks!
Robinhood needs to make a ranking feature like SoFi. I want to the boys 🚀
Gone like his hairline.
I thought about this and while it would take some juice out if the squeeze it wouldn't completely end it. Also it would mean that now we are talking about an up and coming e-commerce platform with an e-commerce guru heading it that has no debt and a bunch of cash on hand. That would only add to the long term viability of gamestop

I'm a simple man...I see rockets 🚀 🚀🚀🚀 I fucking buy!
lol. no love from the mods. i must be some type of banned bc I didn't even get the removal message. Here:

I'm seeing a lot of retards here that think because they've disabled lending, or because they aren't borrowing money, that they're helping fuck over Melvin. That's not the case. Even if you aren't borrowing money, it's still a margin account if you can use instant deposit or have never heard of settlements.

Margin (the type of account) and margin (the money they lend you) are different. ..ish.

Margin accounts let you spend your money immediately after closing a trade, where as cash accounts need you to wait 1 day for options or 2 for stock. RH lets you trade immediately even when under 2000 and not in an official margin account, by personally lending you the money. Instant deposits are the same. They can only lend the money if you're on what is typically called, a margin account.

Luckily for you there's still time to fix it and switch to cash:

You can downgrade to a traditional Robinhood cash account by emailing support@robinhood.com with the following:

- Confirmation that you have $0.00 in unsettled funds and no pending transactions. You can view your unsettled funds in the Account section and your pending transactions in the History section of the account menu.

- Your feedback on why you no longer want to use Robinhood Instant.

*Once we have your email, we should be able to downgrade your account within a few business days.*

**TL;DR:** Increase your tendies by emailing support@robinhood.com the following as soon as possible because it takes a few days to go through. The lazy shits can't even properly take our money.

>"I have no unsettled funds. I want to switch to a cash account to avoid the day trading restrictions."
It doesn't help to see posts or comments of people with diamond hands turning a small amount into huge amounts of money. It also doesn't help to see stocks you sell continue to just keep going your direction.

If anything, sell half or like 80% of your position if you're up a good amount, set a stop loss somewhere and let the rest ride for as long as possible.

I agree it shouldn’t. But there are a lot of suckers stocking groceries with degrees. While it might chock out small business- I would argue they arnt really a business if they can’t pay a real wage so it shouldn’t effect them either right??

No I totally agree. There is a psychological aspect of group engagement when it comes to movies. I am 100% taking positions in theaters as well as hospitality and travel stocks. 

Just remember it's going to be a trickle reopening due to the backlog in vaccinations.
It becomes legalized federally the hype train will launch it to 420 levels. And I think that's every weed stock. I've made 39% profits back from Canopy. Depending on how it goes maybe it's time to sell what I've got in it.
I made that post just for you. go read it so others see it. Everybody thinks that and it's kind of concerning.
Use to have that same mentality. Then when my kid was born, I’ve suddenly become terrified to die. No matter how shitty the fucking world might be but holy shit **LIVING** is just beautiful. Thinking, experiencing, *feeling*. 


Plus, I want to see this kid grow up. I want to comfort him when he’s hurt. I want to encourage him when he’s sad. I want to celebrate him when he achieves. Cant do any of that if I’m dead :(

You have to have a goal in mind otherwise this will happen. 
If your goal is to ride it until the real squeeze then being up 40k or 1k doesn’t make a difference. That’s just part of the process
Short squeezes are any rapid increase in an underlying as the result of shorts covering. This happens in spy every other day.

They are way more often then you think

Imagine having the balls to double down with even more shorts to cover the first shorts these nerds are incinerating million dollar bills.

Why does everyone just forget the great depression, one of the largest stock market bubbles, why did it burst because it got so irrational people feared a bubble burst so they started selling, also another interesting thing was during the great depression the banks were buying up a bunch of assets to calm the market, similar to what the fed is doing and eventually it didn't work

I remember having a huge sense of pride when Blackberry was competing in the phone market. Hell everyone had a Blackberry, BBM was on fire like imessage is now. Waterloo always gave me a huge sense of Canadian pride because of all the Canadian innovation that's pumped out of there. 

People who doubt Blackberry don't know the kind of autism genius level innovation that that region has a reputation for pumping out. Now that they're in cybersecurity expect top notch work.
For those of us planning to buy more Tuesday’s what’s the expectation? Buy at open? Or do we expect a dip later in the day? I’m going full YOLO on GME. I just want to maximize my share count here.

BB is the chick you had in highschool with glasses and pimples. No one wanted to fuck her. Neither did you. One day a guy named Jef said " Damn i havent fked in years...i need some easy pussy". He walked down the hallway to find his prey. BB accidentally bumped him and her books scattered. Jef looks at her and says "why the hell not". BB became popular in one night, throwed away the glasses and let her hair loose. *She was a 10 all along * you thought. You tried to approach her, but now you cant afford her. Ten years later and BB is married to Jeff and she cost more than your 1 bedroom house. And there you are....bald and lonley drinking in a bar at a happy hour thinking why are you so fking retarded.

I don’t precisely but I’m long term bearish unless Cohen has a very precise plan. I’m worried that he will try to tilt them to excessive growth instead of managing as an outstanding cash cow. Excessive investment could set them up for bankruptcy if it’s not done with a large secondary, and even with, dilution. I get really nervous thst some longs are advocating he go out and replicate or compete with steam. That seems nuts. Ecommerce distro of physical games makes sense but I’m not sure how valuable that is since I still think it’s a continually YoY declining category. 

I buy a turn-around that is based on light debt and tons of dividends and better management of the operation. But this isn’t a giant growth sector, it’s a declining market.

So many of the fangs need catalysts. Only Tim apple is strong enough to move up a tiny bit. The rest are all so dead waiting for stuff to happen. I don’t see a reason why Amazon would fall below this support unless some terrible news come out. They are literally the backbone for people in this pandemic, especially with small businesses closing down. It’s gonna bounce off this support IMO.
Since the SEC required margin is 50%, you clearly didn't. Or you misunderstood and it's 80%.

Who cares about long term about this company. Sell at the peak and move onto the next stock.
"probably won't"?  Much more like, "there is no fucking way".
Check the first link in my post as they provide more in depth detail, but in short

Ryan Cohen 12.9% - can’t sell because he upped his stake past 10% which makes him an insider, can’t sell for 6 months

Other board insiders - can sell, in fact some of them did. A few board directors who are leaving as the new wave of directors enter, sold shares on Wednesday, albeit a small amount. These insiders are allowed to sell, but selling large amounts would be against there best interest since they’re the ones who run the company, so we hypothesize that they will not sell.

Institutions - kind of can sell, many institutions are totally free to sell their shares. However, the largest ones which I listed have indexes or ETFs that hold GME so they are unlikely to. For the ones who can sell freely, it may be against their best interest to sell early.

WSB - obviously can sell, however, if we stay true to diamond handing then we take up a sizeable amount of shares. I urge others to keep it cool and hold on, but it is yet to be determined if that will truly play out.

If you have paper hands, think of unshakable conviction that DFV, RC, and some of the yolo'ers in this sub all have. If they can hold with their thousands and thousands of shares, you can hold with your 10-500. They are exemplars of the virtues of prudence, courage, and fortitude. Follow their example.

As for price targets and exit strategies, consider that a squeeze proportionate to VW (a meteoric 5x rise) would take us to 175/share. For some people, that's a ceiling and for others a floor. Of course, you could also be swayed by the logic that the squeeze does not necessitate being tied to VW's rate of increase and could easily be 10x or 15x--the situations are different in a number of ways. It could also do something else entirely. Anyone who tells you for sure what will happen (especially if it involves four digits) is crazy or meme'ing.

But I do know this: if you sell at 45-50, you not only will be robbing yourself of serious money, but you'll let the shorts win and betray the gang. Even if it tops out ay 75-100 like the \*conservative\* estimates posit, you will regret it. Hold fast, have conviction, see it through.

Yeah, saw and (partially) understood that - but it’s the the other scenarios that make your post so helpful. We‘ve seen enough rockets already.

It’s an interesting situation to watch unfold. Moon, or a double up or just sideways... as I got quite a good entry price and only own shares I am not afraid of anything. I can hold for a long time if there’s no immediate liftoff or further uptrend. Heck, I still own Nokia from 1998 worth about 4,5% of my buy in. 💎🚀

there may be a flip side for this. Perhaps Walmart can perfect self-checkout, and the smaller grocers are burdened far more, leading to even more dominance by Walmart and even better performance.

Tremendous read.  Thank you.  His theory seems to be to sell by EOM Thursday if up, due to forced selling in Friday.  Seems like he projects in the 50’s maybe.

What does the number behind my name mean?
They're graded like diamonds. Just make sure it's certified by whatever organization that certifies lab grown diamonds. You'd have to bring it into a lab to get them tested to even tell the difference.

Even simulated diamonds like moissanite uses the 4c's. These are even less expensive and look even better to some people (sparkles more) and most people can't tell the difference.

Of course, she has to be okay with the non-real thing whether it's lab grown or a simulate. 

People think diamonds are rare but there are a crap load of diamonds but supply is controlled by the diamond cartels so they can sell it for way more, that and all the marketing gimmick like diamonds are forever so no one sells them, further limiting supply. 

The history of how diamonds even became part of the marriage tradition is pretty interesting. It's all marketing, decades and decades of marketing.

With your expectation of high volatility, wouldn’t it make sense to execute a straddle option with expiry at 1/29 for those that aren’t necessarily bullish or bearish, just expecting massive volatility?

Based on that chart above Volkswagen did about 5x from bottom to top during the squeeze. GME has already done 10x. Not saying it can’t go up more but it already had a huge run and you’re nuts if you don’t take at least some profit on a 1000% gain.

Bro I’m at 500 BB shares @ 11 and I’m not even pissed. This is for sure 10 bagger eventually. The CEO literally gets an undisclosed cash bonus amount if this stock reaches $30. Sounds like the motherfucker wants to be paid in stock as well. Get your tickets now. I sold GME at 20 because I lost faith. I will not fuck up this time!!!!!

Nice post. Appreciate the research. 

I've seen cramer say that 144% of GME shares are shorted, but that was a couple days ago. Since then, I've seen speculation of higher % as well. 

Along with that I've seen twitter reports of" brokerages raising requirements or completely eliminating margin on $GME... margin calls going out".  I'm assuming tuesday morning.

Just exercise and sell the shares.  They probably have no extrinsic value anyway.
Sell them for a little under the asking price and some MM will buy it
>  this is not even bringing up the opportunities that they have with the brick and mortar stores they do still have though

What opportunities do you see with the brick and mortar stores?

I expect a sell off from hype stocks into value stocks and commodities, similar to dot com this is a sectoral bubble not a market wide, and the crash will not be market wide either.

Calculus definitely provides a good foundation for understanding rates of change and accumulation. I don't have much experience with the financial side of math, but an elective course in financial math or math modeling, and perhaps differential equations, might help improve understanding.

I wouldn't regret getting a degree in neuroscience. It's definitely becoming a more in-demand field in academia (although I completely respect your distaste for that).
Good luck with the tendies.

As someone who ordered a computer from Ibuypower Linus tech tips number one recommended builder, I hope GME kills it in this area. 

IBP has almost no competition and baits you in then fucks you right in the ass, you literally cannot call them without trying 50-100 times, it will just go to busy, my email from 12/08/20 took them over a month to respond to, they offer discord help but you need to sit at your comptuer until one of their mods pops their stupid fucking heads out and says 15 more tickets up, and your scrounging just like the other 1,000 nerds trying to get a ticket.  FUCK IBP. Estimated ship date was last week, the only thing they've done in 6 weeks is process my payment. I'd cancel but I feel like at this point a decent company might take longer then IBP will.
It has a lot of potential due to the current circumstances. High steel prices, which are moving higher, supply side deficits, commodity inflation due to monetary policy, major government infrastructure plans, and competitors, such as Tata Steel have recently published massive profit margins.
[deleted]
I think an important aspect that needs to be mentioned is that IV is stupidly high on all options for GME right now. Big movements are already priced in, so you can easily lose money even if you correctly guess whether it'll go up or down. I would not play anything even remotely close to the money. Ironically, FDs are the best value with the understanding that it'll likely be 0 or a multiple bagger.
yep! $2k more coming in hot!

You can create one if you are in an eligible country and share it up to 20 people can sign up with any given code before it no longer works

You need a pretty big account to consider surviving off of it. Ideally you want to keep money in the account not constantly taking out. Yeah some people like to gamble risky plays, can go either way. 

You can make good money if your smart, the markets also in a bull run, so it's not that difficult in the current climate.

AMD still has a lot of room to grow in their market cap if you compare to Nvidia and Intel. The sell off is definitely an overreaction. Intel still sucks atm.

You need to have enough buying power in the account to cover 100 shares per contract at the strike price.

If you have buying power go to your option and look for the exercise button below your options information. This will take your cash and get you the shares at your strike price.

Well, I will be hedging this position since I’m uncertain about the market’s reaction to the inauguration. But again, this is long term. Another thing I’m considering is the potential for an increase in the minimum wage. I think this is bearish for brick and mortar retail and bullish for an undervalued e-commerce platform such as Wish. Sorry for the rude ass message earlier, hope you jump in and join the party especially if we dip below IPO price again.
They have some GME Shares i do not know how many they have to trade but if Europoors buy a lot  and there are not so many GME Shares in Europe the Price will go up far beyond.

Here is the MOST important part imo that this discussion didn’t take into account: 

Not as many people bought GME as you in your deep GME gang thought they did. A lot of people missed out, so they wanted another stock to blow up and catch the ride on.

Yeah, seeing this indicator being represented as bullish a lot lately and it doesn't make any sense. I think it's actually slightly bearish in situations where most of the upwards pressure comes from margin'd retail holders, but most objectively all it represents is high volatility that's making brokers want to lend out more under the anticipation of shares becoming available soon.
Lol
too many people short sold GME, now they're getting fucked because lots of others bought it and made the price rise. TLDR old people are losing literally millions.

i dunno about the 20c's specifically but some of the higher strikes (like 30c's) were up over 50,000% after a couple days.

They went from a premium from pennies to dollar amounts so go figure. There are retail traders out there that are undoubtedly bankrupt from this week. Collecting as little as $5K in premiums from naked calls "that were never going to print" would leave them with a loss in the 7 figures (well they've be liquidated before it reached that point, but yeah it will blow up an account)

That's true but if you want leverage, option is the way to go. You can potentially go with call spread to minimize IV crush but beyond that, it's hard to get get around it. Try some of the option strategies of selling calendar spreads to fund your longer term options. Eg. Buy Jan 2022 and sell otm weeklies at key resistance to minimize risk of exercise.
$694.20 i think is a better one. Lol

And I think there is long term sentiment beyond the squeeze. I could imagine if people 10 bagger they will buy back in some, or let it ride. If they get us stimmy checks fast, we might be able to reload it extra.

With current movement, 139c is too much OTM if you wanted to play safe, Theta will consume you. That strike is a lotto play. Seems AAPL doesn´t want to break above 131 in the past 2 weeks.

They have like 8-10 people working in the store as opposed to their regular zoo of people (less in labor cost). AAPL is going to crush it.

Ah so i can have 0 margin but because I'm technically borrowing the money for the day trades its "margin". Is that it or am I even dumber?
No idea, but vanguard index fund definitely makes money lending shares. That’s how zero fee works.
They can issue $100 million in new shares. There are about $2.5 billion worth of shares short (72M shares at $35.50). On Wednesday, about $5 billion in shares traded. The offering wouldn’t even be noticeable at current prices, let alone squeeze prices.

No. I can’t afford cable Tv. All my money is in the stonks.
This is probably a full retard bear question, but how would the IV look at the top of squeeze for a long-dated OTM put option? We for example know that it’s not feasible the valuation to hold at $200 for example, and a option at say $50p in +3 months feels like it should get close to ITM. Thoughts?

Don't tell him 🤭. Let the retardedness happen.
Minimum wage increases won't effect people who have college loan debt... at least it shouldn't. Minimum wage was meant for kids to get in to the workforce and get some experience; it was never intended to be something you could buy a house and raise kids on. All raising the minimum wage will do is further choke out small businesses, and speed up the rate of automation. The free market should dictate wage based on demand. Central government planning never ends well as they pick winners and losers based on political expediency rather than wisdom.

Still new to this. Bought AAPL Jan 29 139c. 

Is this really stupid and risky ? Plan would be to flip them before earnings, play is anticipation of an earnings run up after trading sideways for so long and looking like they are going to have monster results. 10 percent increase is a huge amount of market cap.

Is there a better way to play it ? Less OTM?

I don’t hold GME and people that pump it are annoying as shit but there is still a massive short on it.
Thanks- that's the answer I was hoping for!

So again with over 100% short interest, wouldn't a margin call probably be BULLISH in this case?
Yeha i guess I’ll just hold and maybe try to average down
One thing I am learning since dipping into options over the past year is I constantly under-estimate MMs. They are composed of not stupid career trade veterans and rarely get caught with their pants pulled down. Those firms know how to limit damage and I’ll guarantee they are mitigating constantly. MOASS’s cost people their careers and while I’d love for It to happen and the entire WSB community to get rich, I’m very skeptical the MMs will lay down and take the billions dollar dildo passively. Will be interesting to see how it all plays out. GLTA.

I’ll add that at $300 its market cap will be at 21B which is still way less than CHWY (41.6B) on comparable financials and the SAME management team. 

In this frothy market anything is possible and GME could get to CHWY levels quickly.

I understand the concept that our entire discussion could could totally wrong, and GameStop could literally either skyrocket to 50, or plummet back down to 10. You never know until you know. But I think we all agree that we appreciated the detail of your discussion.

Huge news if true. I'll increase my Put position on Tuesday if they confirm this business strategy. 

First of all, Gamestop employees are in no way qualified to speak with any confidence about the technical PC parts needed for high-end gaming rigs. 

They are part-time High School kids who weren't even born when Battletoads came out. 

Besides, this business model has been tried once before. The company was called RadioShack. They also had Trump Steaks and Sharper Image massagers - and they failed.

But I guess Gamestop has Funko dolls, so there's that.
So whets our next play?

THIS SHIT IS FUELED UP AND READY TO BLOW 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 ILL NEVER SELL
Fantastic piece! Been in GME since $4.5 and this battle is getting stronger by the day. The most interesting thing recently was the selling of approximately 500k shares (their entire position) by DOMO Capital, who were actively touting a short squeeze. My (personal) view is that these have been sold to Gabe/Melvin who are using this to dump, or cover their positions, by offering the intraday high price. If people want to push for a short squeeze, they should buy shares, not calls.

Edit: Bought at $4.5 then topped up at $16.
Don’t hate the player hate the game.

I actually think there is an area for fan items in the e-commerce gaming section. Like toys and other merch doesn't really have a great platform. If GME just focus on nerdy game collectibles I think they could do ok.

This is the way
The thing is no one knows when a correction will come. I remember the fear back in March, everyone was online and on TV talking about a ‘W-shaped recovery, dead cat bounce, etc. Had individuals bought into that fear, they would’ve missed out on some of the most glorious gains ever. Generational wealth was created by rising the wave upwards — and those who listened to the fear, W-shaped recover talk panicked and sold down 20-30% in fear of losing more of their life’s earnings. Those people lost so much and watched the massive bull run from the sidelines
Exactly... that was my point

Hey, when you're right, you're right.

I believe it’s the duration the equity is held not how it was obtained that is the difference between treating it as personal income vs capital gains. One year comes to mind. Not a tax accountant here, just a full tard.

Ya I noticed that. If everyone stayed bullish wouldn’t we just be bulls forever?
Economics extremely simplified;

Shares = finite commodity

Short positions need shares to reduce their losses. They have heavy firepower, but remember this is not their whole world, it is probably a small set of their strategy on average. It seems like the only thing that matters to this community but it is not so for them. The cover cost they are able to provide is a function of their net worth and leverage, and thus, determined by their weight class. Large firms can expose themselves to high risk, smaller ventures cannot.

Short positions lost almost a billion last week. They have also doubled down, interestingly, which indicates that they are able to hold their position at price levels of the low 30s and are certain that the share price will drop. Either through paper-handed moves or institutional moves. I would expect that short positions can hold for a cumulative total of a few billion before dropping out as a demographic. I'm expecting a dip to $30 due to manipulation then a squeeze within 14 days. So another sustained large dip before short squeeze, if you bought above $35 then it'll look grim for a while.

Full disclosure my field is economics and not finance, this is just my thinking!

Gotta chop at the ankles if you wanna take down giants.
Do you actually think GME is going to hit mid 50’s next week?
After this can we get Apple and TSLA to get back up? Thanks in advance.
Can you tell a retard where that setting is?
Thanks bro👍
Honest question, retard fresh out of the packaging here, but I bought at 17, sold out at 34, and bought back all in at 36 with what I made. Did I do it wrong or was this the right decision? I figured any more stock that I could gobble up is less stock Melvin gets, am I wrong?
Maybe if all the WSB autists tweeted at him & promised to buy new Teslas with our tendies we might be able to get him to come play. I mean, with him selling the short shorts, you know that he'd love to screw the shorts again...
Embrace me.

Everyone seems to have a different approach to accounting.  MorningStar has Float at 27.29M.

I am not expert in gamma and hedging. What I know is that last year, gme bond price drop from 100 to 70 and many buy put options to hedge those risk. That’s increase short GME to over 100%. I actually do not know the mechanic how the above works ?

Besides the deal with MSFT where they get a cut of all their digital game sales
GTFO
This killed me
let me add to the Pokémon packs stuff: right now there is an insane amount of hype for Pokémon booster packs (in Europe as well as the US). They’re sold out of virtually everything at GameStopDE, most  new  booster packs (champions path, vivid voltage etc. were sold out in the first hour. GameStop is already the #1 location for Pokémon releases in Germany  since the only other stores getting those packs are one man card shop businesses. There’s another big release coming up In February (shining fates). I’m certain GameStop is in a similar position in the US. Those packs are even reselling at double MSRP, there’s huge potential for GameStop if they manage to secure more stock and sell the hyped booster packs in bundles with less hyped booster packs to profit off of that. I went in store at GameStop 3 days after the release and the clerk told me I was the 25th person to ask him about that booster pack already. I’ll try to find out how many boxes of SF they get if the store is opened again next month (current lockdown). People are saying GameStop is dying but really they are in a good position selling PC parts, games and collectibles like Pokémon cards and funko pops. Even without a squeeze I’ll be long GameStop, they are truly underappreciated and I am certain RC can make this a 10B stock in no time.
Is it bad that so far I’ve made more money gambling than trading stocks?

That´s some high IQ play right there
I like your funny words magic man
covid breakout, financical times and wsj bearish too
The hidden truths of wall st: They are all as stupid as we are.
If he bought at $35.50 he would need $174 mill. I believe his current holdings of 12.9% cost him only $75 mill because his cost average is so low (You can figure out his actual cost average from his 13D filing but pretty sure his average cost is $8), so honestly he could probably afford that just off his GME gains rn. 

Also dudes a billionaire so it actually might be likely to happen
Three huuuge reasons he would benefit from a squeeze: 

3. Clout: This would be the greatest announcement of his coming and would herald in a new era for GameStop by putting the whole financial world’s spotlight on them

2. Shareholders: in all his letters he’s pointed out that protecting/pursuing shareholders interest is one of his foundational goals

1. Cash: this would be the greatest opportunity for free massive cash influx at the expense of shorters by doing an offering when it squeezes
Letsgoooo tards

They can. If the LEAPS market flairs hot enough to move sentiment. Otherwise, do they really have the same impact in this instance where the goal is to make it harder to close buy orders in a squeeze? Tell me if I'm wrong in that, but don't waste too much breath, I don't really "learn lessons".
Hw much money is enough for you guys to retire?
No buddy. These days matter too.
Jesus Christ, I thought Friday would have taught you dickless morons a lesson. Most of you are living paycheck to paycheck. Given bad information, you are going to cause yourself even more financial distress. WSB does not have an effect on the market. It is however a tool that can be used by those that control the market. And not for your benefit.

Basically, just buy Aphria instead of Tilray... The ratio is .8381. Tilray is at $19.70 x .8381 = 16.51 USD. Aphria should be at 16.50 USD.

Anyone on the sidelines with GME, but have some really sweet meme video ideas... remember that scene in The Patriot where the Lt. is like “but sir, you’ve taken the field” then he’s like “now we shall take their spirits” replace “the field” with borrowed shares, then “spirits” with calls. Europoors are obviously Melvin, and you know how the movie ends.

It still means an L because we make them lose a bag. It isn't about bankrupting them, it's about hurting them, winning some tendies, and coming back richer for the next hunt. I think you will be amazed at collective action through memes and dreams, versus how lame it must be to be a bear. GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀

The toys/collectible business is huge for them though, so I wouldn't say they should get rid of that.  Dunno about candy though (cheap but high margin, not sure if worth the shelf space?)

Also started at 40k last year. Up to 120k rn, was 140k on Thursday but GME dipped. Can't wait for next week
What movie is this? I feel like there has been at least 10 movies I need to watch from all the new memes people are coming out with
Interesting read. Thanks!
can't ignore the obvious signs that it's a sinking ship. good luck buddy
The risk is on Tilray's side. Aphria is the much better company in every aspect. Higher revenue, lower costs, better brands etc. Tilray needs Aphria, Aphria doesn't need Tilray.  If the merger doesn't go through Tilray would be screwed. 

Lastly, your statement of 'high risk of the deal not going through' is false. Irwin Simon stated it's definitely expected to close no problem.
GME or TSLA puts, pick one

Edit: don’t do it pussy. More to life than you think there is.
Proof?
Congrats man nice job

I did appreciate it, but you're trying to be a dick and an elitist pretending WSB hasn't always been a joke, when you, yourself, in fact, posted trying to be funny. And yeah, if you talk shit about how the past was better, someone might just check your past WSB history.

You'll own the option to buy that many shares at the strike price.  If its market value is above your strike price you essentially make 1000x the difference in value.

I've become very nervous. Not because I'm scared to lose my money, fuck that. I just don't want to miss the squeeze! Close monitoring is required. I'm holding till the end. I've set up a sell order at 650. Sure hope we can take off that high. Let's do this, brothers.
Cramer & Faber remember the hate mail. Shit bet they are still reading those letters from the 90s.
Seems weird that they're allowed to short more shares than exist, but it's on them for *shorting more shares than exist*. They need to be aware that that's a very precarious position, and that it can go tits up.

When you say shit will go down on Tuesday,  do you mean the stock price will go up or down? sorry my brains a bit smooth like that

I’m not really an investor or in finance, I know enough to understand real science from hype... in other words, This isn’t a theranos situation.     My personal view was that Tesla was a pretty bad company with a great product in the past.    This has shifted slowly.   But asking me where I have seen other companies able to do extremely difficult things across multiple industries is really not analogous.   Musk is an important part of the  company, I don’t think Tesla would be where it is without him, but where I think people fail to understand Tesla is the quality of their team.   They have an army of really smart people, some of whom I’ve been lucky to know, and the truth is they will disrupt many industries in coming years, not simply automotive.   Starlink is probably the easiest example... especially for curious people to begin to understand what I’m saying...  if they follow the trajectory of that particular concept, and how it will tie into it’s vehicles and begin to allow Tesla to disrupt other industries.  Tesla is far more likely to dethrone apple’s key products than the other way around.   And it’s not an either-or question, musk versus hero worship or cult... all that is nuts and admittedly true ... but for me it’s real science and army of nerds making things happen that excites me... karpathy and deep learning and how musk has recaptured the a space race without a Cold War.      It’s awesome man

You know you created a new PLTR meme right?
More food for thought:

There is that one dude who published his work of taking pix of ppl's texts, so a novels-worth of comments from this sub is just a work in the making 🧐🤔
Dd?
Yeah I am deep into 2/19 150 calls. Been doubling down and price avg at 2 but still down almost  50%  they closed at 1.10 Friday. I’m hoping they go down one more time so I can snag 10 more at 100 or lower to bring my price down to like 1.30. It then just has to get to 135 or 136 by 1/29 to get out with a little something 138 would most likely net a nice 40% gain maybe more. 
In the meantime I’ve been just ripping puts. I played the same damn 128 1/22 put 4 times for 30% each time in 2 days. Could have done it 8 but didn’t want to push it.
Is MARA gunna moon Tuesday?

you mean $42,069.69?
May green be in your future.
Any idea of websites with current short interest information? I seem to be too retarded for google.
Everyone was with $GME for months til it happened. It’s a waiting game after all
I'm finally convinced. Tuesday i'm getting in.
shorts don’t have a say in it, their brokers force them to pay the premium. This is why everyone needs to sell limit at 420.69 and that will become the strike they HAVE to pay.

You’re correct in evaluating the growth potential of the position, not the risk.  

I’d look at the chance of profit % for each weekly sold, and modify based on your own research.  I would also calculate it on a per contract basis.

You’re basically trying to calculate the compound probability of dependent events.  

https://www.ck12.org/c/probability/probability-of-compound-events/lesson/Probability-of-Compound-Events-BSC-ALG/

Things get kind of murky, as there are multiple variables that will effect the impact of n1 on n2, but it is a good way to develop a general heuristic for the trade.

I would spread my short leg out over multiple strikes as well, to minimize risk.
Should I liquidate my AAPL and AMZN weeklies? Or take the theta hit and hope we rebound by Friday? Short weeks fucking SUCK
I just found out that the IRS won’t be accepting tax returns until February 12. This shit is sooo gayyyy😑. I’ve been waiting every day for my W-2s to come, and I’ve been waiting on this money. This is some bullshit....

I was not aware of that. However, why then does one of them only sell roughly 8% while the others sell roughly 50% each? This makes it seem like at least one of them chose to not sell the maximum percentage that they could, no?
I think some shorts covered or someone is lending out their shares for a fee.
$12 1/22. first options call ever. i should be good right??
It will go up or down. Or trade sideways
I’m not blind, right? That 100% has to be wings of redemption
Are we sure Cohen is on board with this strategy if it began before he was on the BoD?  I can't see why he wouldn't think it's a great move, but it seems like this is the perfect thing to announce at the conference, and they pulled out.

Short story time: I invited tinder date over one time. Got drunk as hell, tried to fuck her. She was on her period. I still tried to fuck her, but ended up not doing it. 
So fast forward 2 weeks later and she’s texting me that if she is pregnant will I take good care of the baby. I’m like whaaat the fuuuck? We didn’t even fuck. Then she started going on about how some sperm could have slipped in when I was trying to fuck. I just read those texts with my mouth open. I thank god every day I didn’t fuck that psycho and get stuck with her for 18 years.
Stock moe has 300k youtube subs and he's pumping it now, should be a decent tuesday unless bad news kick in first

It makes sense for them to keep shorting nasty since there’s no news or updates as of yet. If Ryan tweets some magic during the long weekend, shorts could have a bumpy ride next week.

That’s also not exclusive to Covid-19. All viruses can cause cardiovascular complications due to the bodies inflammation response spreading into the circulation system leading to myocarditis, and inflammation in the arteries raising the risk of blocked arteries, weakened arterial walls, and aneurysms.

Respiratory scarring can occur with any disease that shows symptoms in the respiratory system. Common colds, bronchitis, even allergies and sinus infections that lead to sinus drainage and coughing fits.

Neural dysfunctions are also regularly caused by infections and the bodies inflammation response. As well as every other system in your body. Inflammation is an important part of the bodies response to infections. It’s the primary way you can increase blood flow, and in turn an increase in white blood cells to the area to fight the infection. But an over reaction from your body can do just as much damage as it does good.

It’s a good thing people are starting to realize that diseases can cause complications outside of the normal symptoms. But know that it’s not exclusive to Covid-19. And it isn’t more common in Covid-19 either. It just gets more attention currently.
The question is where do you live and how much will it cost to get into your first unit?

why the fuck is it called ufc "fight night" when the fights are at 12 in the afternoon
$BB has 8% short interest. There are thousands of comments going around saying it’s a squeeze candidate. While GameStop has over 100% short interest on the stock. $BB is NOT A SQUEEZE CANDIDATE. I will be posting this all weekend to warn r/wallstreetbets because if you’re investing in $BB you’re hoping on a pump on the news that dropped (which did happen) it is NOT short squeeze candidate. It feels like a discord group got together and decided to pump that to WSB this week (then dumped next day.) This weeks price action on GME was not the result of the short squeeze at all. On fundamentals alone shorts haven’t exited their positions.

https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-soars-60-in-apparent-short-squeeze-11610559366

Buy more GME and ignore anyone pumping any other stock. This rocket is going to take off. It’s fundamentals are all right there. Don’t get pumped and dumped by $BB. 

They announced a new phone & a OS partnership with Sony for their car that is years away.

THINK YOU AUTIST.

1.	⁠Who is buying black berrys anymore?
2.	⁠Who is buying a Sony car? No one.
3.	⁠$BB partnered with Amazon to standardize a platform for car analytics. Okay, good luck convincing any company not partnered with $BB to just hand over their data to them. No serious EV company has agreed. Tesla is never going to get on board with that.
4.	⁠It pumped on that news because now people realize $BB isn’t a completely dying company.

Don’t get caught holding those bags. BUY GAME. It’s price was suppressed the past two days by the largest sale in stock ever from the two board members that left. And it barely declined. This rocket is getting ready to go.
Shake that 🌈🐻 mentality there’s no crash coming. STONKS only go 🚀🚀🚀

I been anticipating a crash from 2017-2020 because of this stupid gay bear book I read called “the sale of a lifetime” missed a huge bull run.. but STONKS will only keep going from here, maybe another flash crash.

Yeah I feel. At some point I might say FUCK what they think and do it OR lie to them, it's seriously a huge saver. Over 5 years, that could be over $80k
This is fucking amazing. I’ll add another 109 shares to my position
Uptick rule tho?
The question I have... why WOULDN'T GameStop do another offering of stock? Sure, they'd be giving the people who shorted them an out, but they'd still be taking money from them at a decent premium that they can use to save their business - and it'd be going to them instead of WSB.

Is there not enough time to get approvals or something?
Is there 2024? haha

I have 7 units. I can give you tons of advice. (Cheaper / less gains)Houses < duplex < 4 plex < apartment units < apartment complex (expensive / gains galore). Having multiple units covers those units that are empty.

Manager cheaper manger fees do not correlate to better managers. You need to ask about maintenance fees / hr. Tenent finder fees. Base monthly fees. Itemized statements with receipts. You have to keep on them.

 My manager was a buddy of mine, it sucked, I had to fire him in about 6 months. 

I took the properties over my self I manage all maintenance / rent collection.. My wife manages bills, mortgages, rental advertising. 
 
The courts are never in your favor when it comes to evictions. It is better to offer the tenant cash to leave in a week. for example I had a tenant who would not pay this month. I offered her $300 to leave by today. She just left 30 minutes ago. It would have cost me $300 to evict her, plus I would have lost $700 for this month, plus our lost $700 for next month. The courts would not have evicted her until the 6th of February.
🍆🍆🍆💦💦💦
Yes, it can happen. You can file hsr then find an issue with the company that makes you not want to go through with purchase. However that  would paint the target company in a bad light which I doubt is what the PLTR insiders want. 

So in the pltr case I highly doubt they’d pull out of it

Should call and say something like “hey so I heard the GameStop in San Diego is going to have PC build stations  by July and I was curious if the one near me in (enter city here) is doing the same?” 

I say July because I’m assuming it won’t be that quick and if the sales person knows the real timeline then they may slip up and say something like “that’s odd, I was only aware that stores will have stations by September”

I've been buying since September when it was sub-10 & rolling profits from other stocks into GME as I went along.

With recent purchases, I gapped up to 23.58, so technically I need 423.58 for 7 figure profit. 

Would love to see 694.20, but I'm not greedy...

Its not really. The short interest is more than 100%. They need to close their positions. If they want to close their positions, they need to buy a share from us. We already have a buyer that HAS TO buy all our shares, sooner or later. And we can put the price we want, cause there are more buyers than sellers.

Ty for the insight! I imagine there is a certain price point where shorts have to cover too.
We run about 2 million Covid tests a day apparently. If under Biden a new process starts by which Positive cases immediately get BAM or Regen, let’s say out of the 200,000 daily cases just 10% are good for BAM. 20,000 x $1,000 a day is $20M a day in revenue that could materialize out of thin air. AND this napkin math is just US population.

I know what that *should* do for the market cap, but what it *will* do is likely something very different.

Now pharma has had a good run since March 2020, so I don’t expect anything insane.

So should buy 10k on the dip or just tuesday morning at whatever price?
There's actually a short bid rule in effect for Tuesday which hinders their ability to drive the price down by shorting. So Tuesday could be a good upward move without shorts dragging it down.

Compared to us they might, but they are still a business that is out for profits. And these stupid ass shorts are going to get someone fired.

How many katanas do you own?
Even if the short is 0.27% of their portfolio we could make it blow up and they might lose real percentage chunks. If they shorted at 40 and it runs to 80, thats a loss of 0.54% plus interest fees. If we run it really high, and there is nothing left to short, we could make them lose a chunk. They're not the only short, we will spread the pain.

This is common misconception. There is no calibrated standard for ring sizing. A ring size could be off due to something as simple as getting ring mandrels from different vendors.

They are of course going to find a way to take advantage of retail investors and take their money. Do your own research and joining hype trains after they have left the station is another risk also
I've been considering it, but I dont feel i have enough saved up yet. I trade forex for quick 1-2 day trades and stocks for 3-6 month plays and while I feel I make enough, it would worry me to be reliant on that as i might start making mistakes and be under more pressure. 

It's nice to have the skills to do it though, takes some pressure off my job and let's me dream bigly

In the next couple of weeks, we might see the squeeze. If it reaches 200-300, HOLD! with all the fucking shorts dying, that is NOT the maximum for the squeeze. 450 at least! To the moon!

In order for cohen to purchase the remaining 7% to hit his cap at these price levels how much capital would he need?
Yeah
I really fuckin hope so. I doubled down after Q3 at $11 knowing his conviction. I doubled again this week with $45 strike 1/22. Just hoping I dont need to role those over for another week or 2. This is surely a powder keg and cohen has a book of matches.

Might be in the minority here but if she's okay with it, go for lab created ones. Way cheaper. The diamond industry created the most successful marketing campaign in history.

They will not sell their shares to the shorts trying to cover. ETFs are usually market cap weighted so the change in stock price does not cause a rebalancing.

Of course they do lend their shares to the shorts, that's how we end up with such a high short interest.

Might be small relative to AUM but depending on how hard they get crushed on the shorts it could completely water down the results on whatever fund they were doing this in. This isn’t going to kill them but they will feel it for sure if they aren’t hedging.

Nope now's the perfect time! 🚀🚀🚀 Moon next week!
If we hold the swings to +/- 10% then the price they pay to hold the short bleeds them money. It isn't enough to throw in the towel but we might grind this out hard next week. We only win if we keep up the buying pressure. Some of us got paychecks friday and tendie rockets reloaded, but I advise keeping your powder liquid and buying every dip.
You'll need to hold for a few years at least to hit 400.

Melvin Capital is a 13bn AUM hedge fund. According to the last 13F, the GME short accounted for 0.27% of their portfolio [Link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link)

And unless they're stupid they should have bought hedges by now (which we will only know when their next 13F is made public). You retards are just landing pinpricks on an elephant but it feels satisfying to diss them I guess lol
Yeah I hear ya man. The more money I make from my career, the less I feel like I have.

Lmfaoo exactly. That’s crazy haha. Unless they have completely remodeled their entire business structure I just can’t get behind the idea that this business whose revenue streams are becoming more and more obsolete is somehow going to the moon. Even if they’re selling tons of consoles, the business just seems so dead. That would create a pop in revenues short term but not so much beyond that imo. I’m retarded tho and will be the first to admit I know nothing ab the company other than what I’ve seen/experienced firsthand

§240.10b-5   Employment of manipulative and deceptive devices.

Look that up at ecfr.gov. I don’t think this subreddit has anything to worry about. Legally, a pump and dump occurs when a current shareholder decides to lie/defraud new investors to increase the value of shares and then sells at peak and scrams. What you autists are doing seems to be an attempt to bankrupt Melvin while at the same time securing your investments in a company you think will and should do well. Never mind the fact that the past three cycles of PlayStation drops have boosted GME to 38 and beyond (around 70 if I remember) for over half a year each time. That alone is enough reason to warrant the buzz. I’m not sure how any attorney could look into this and think that a legitimate violation of regulations is occurring. That said, you guys should refrain from saying things like “pump it” or anything that would even bring the eye of sauron aka the SEC looking your way.
Selling puts are bullish for the seller, you don’t want the price to drop. You still collect premium which is a slight hedge but overall, you should be selling calls if you think the price is dropping

I’m not writing any options, because it moves so fast that either direction it could cost you

I remember when all the of the ARK funds launched. They IPO'ed at $20 and I think that was back around 2016.

Just to ask a stupid question that is probably obvious to everyone else who has folds in their grey matter...  If Melvin and others are in such a bad spot on this and they're slowly being backed into a pinch.  Doesn't it make sense for them to actually double down and help us push the squeeze and cut their losses?  Certainly the upside of monstrous gains would out way the bad shorts..

I would agree with you in a normal market, but QS had almost a 60b mc last year w/o a product. My thinking is that the ev hype will start to fade this year and that money will flow back into TSLA and whatever the new hot sector is. I think one promising study from any of these gene companies is all that’s needed to for the sector to take off like crazy (not that it isn’t crazy already).
I don't care if PLTR shoots up to fcking 1000$. It's a matter of principle at this point. Fck this stock.

I don't know about your personal case but I personally graduated as fast as possible (3yr). Yea college was pretty fun, but the opportunity cost of not working (starting salary + additional loans taken each year + loan interest compounding) was like easily in six figure territory so.... And I didn't exactly come from a privileged background so it was a no brainer for me
Wait, is it too late to get in??
Fuck yeah man! Lets start the year by making the Melvins who have been fucking average people over forever kill themselves for once.

I have agree to you. I'm fairly new on this subreddit myself, and fairly new to investing. I started around start of december and BB was the first one where I bought any shares in (mainly cause I started with extremely low funds). BB was around 7ish at that time and I only had money to buy 4 stocks at that time lol. Anyway, there was no increase for a week, I managed to invest another 300 euros to my investment account and so I went for the GME meme stock at around 19$. I've made a few hundred profit from GME and now I came back to BB since it shows more promise. In with 30 @ 10.24$ average.  
BB to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
Except we can only lose the shares we buy. A guy betting $3k today, might lose that, but not more.

These guys have literally no limit to their loss. Depending on how much the stock goes up, they can theoretically lose infinite money.
I bought calls on the Bills
Shorts aren't leaving, we should stop spreading scared sentiment and start spreading squeeze sentiment

Paper handed retail won’t drop the price. Institutional ownership of GME is over 100%(cause of short sold shares, pretty hilarious) 

Retail needs to sell when they like the number and can’t handle more risk. I know 💎👋🏼 is great and those that do will make the most money (probably) but the squeeze will end when BlackRock and friends unload some of their positions.

Coming from someone with experience in your hypothetical scenario, “work earlier” means no one will take you seriously for promotion until you’re older, even when you have the best performance/experience.  You’re just the “young guy who’s good at his job” for like 5 years.  You end up in the same trajectory as everyone else your age, except you don’t have a degree but instead a few extra years of work weighing down your soul.
As a fellow retard, I have no idea but I've already placed my bets with rest of you.  Free money sounds too good to be true so I'm looking at this from all sides.  I'm sure Melvin has a lot of smart folks working for them and maybe some retards, too, so the MOASS has to be on their radar.  It could be that brokerages aren't on anyone's side other than then own and they are trying to limit their exposure and not get torched if/when this 🚀🚀🚀🚀 takes off.

Why
It’s the same company that told me I qualified for free shipping, charged me for shipping anyway, delegates all customer service to overseas 3rd party companies and then sent the item in such a small box it got crushed. 

They should teach a class on how to lose a business for being retarded.
I think the main argument is that it pumped so much in so little time based on optimism let's be honest here, that it's bound to crash or there has to be a correction

The downside risk is total loss of the investment, but it cannot go further than that. If I buy 100 $10 shares, and the bitch collapses to $1 two years later, I'm out $900. If I buy a $5 strike option for $6.00 and it drops to $1, I'm out $600. The downside risk is mitigated. The only place of higher risk is in the $4 to $5 range at expiration.

LEAPS are not roulette.
Yeah at first I was like ok looks like we're yoloing like it's 2005, GME and BB are back. No, it is that we spotted severely undervalued companies with potential, and this makes them good investments in classical value investing senses. Of course, with added 🚀🚀🚀🚀 the prices get pushed up more, but it isn't like someone made a funny GME or BB meme and we all voted GME to be top meme stocks. GME is rising, and we're making memes along the way. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

I’ve been seeing a lot of comments recently talking about I’m down 5k, I’m down 10k, my life’s over if I don’t hit on this option etc. guys if you’re playing with options 5 or 10k is nothing to make back. If you would have bought plug two weeks ago, your $200 in call options would be worth over 10 grand right now depending on the strike and expiry. At the end of the day as long as you have some money left learn from your mistakes and become profitable. You might not hit a 10 or 20 bagger but start taking your wins and learn from your mistakes. you can erase a 10k deficit in a few weeks if you make good picks but you can’t make your money back if you’re dead.

120bn TAM, 70% gross margin, means gross profit of $84bn. Assuming you get exponential growth, the target should be reached within 10yrs. Discount that at 15-20%, give it a 15 multiple, comes to 300bn. Right now it's valued at 50bn. Way undervalued!!!

At some point I imagine Cohen would agree to it though no? Issuing shares at a much higher valuation than otherwise possible is the primary benefit for a company in situations like these. In fact, wiping all debt from the balance sheet and having a few billion off the bat to restructure the company going forward would be hugely positive in the long term (terrible for the squeeze though)

One month is still too young. At least 2 or 3 months would be better. Lets say 2
Over on the gamestop subreddit, full of gamestop employees, Cohen has a bad reputation because of his plan to shutter most of the brick and mortar stores.

I'm not very confident in GME long term either, but don't straight up ignore fundamental changes.
I’ve read as high as 137 I think, there’s actually even more short interest.
Man I hope not too. But if I had a gun to my head to pick right, I’m betting on Rodgers today.
Does RC have an incentive for GME to squeeze? I'm sure he's aware of what's going on and perhaps finds it entertaining/interesting but he doesn't really benefit from a squeeze does he? If anything I could maybe see it as a bad look to shoot up in value then go back down to fair value as it makes it look like people are just playing games with your company because they don't see real value in it.

I’ve been doing this for about a decade. It’s pure luck. All I do is look at the price charts (literally just stare at the pattern - no fancy technical analysis) & news/gossip. I read the matrix and the matrix says “you’re a clueless retard but I’ll be benevolent”.
   
I can hold for years if I believe in a company. Or a few days. The only time I sold with loss was because I wasn’t aware of a hostile takeover that took years to resolve. One trade wrong out of many = luck.

Just sit sidelines just in case insiders dump after lockup ends within the next month or two.  But I had leaps since PLTR was $20.  I don't see PLTR going back in their teen's but PLTR growth is insane with signing new contracts every month.
Yeah, inflation doesn't seem to be on WSB mind at the moment.  Please don't come around saying no one said anything.
Depends on COL in your area, how long you plan to stay in house, among other things. It's a tough decision.

Has anyone heard anything about this? Could be just random twitter bs, but also could be an inside scoop.

Also, PSA for all GME shareholders on margin: Please talk to your broker and find out what your margin requirements are going into next week and adjust for that. The shorts are betting on a lot of us being unable to hold our positions next week, so see what you need to do whether deposit or move other positions over to cover.
What did OP say
Eh if you are struggling with cutting losses that sounds like an entry and exit point issue.  I typically have a general idea of at what point I will cut bait on the downside and upside when I enter the trade.  For me at least my decisions are usually based on the underlying as opposed to the option itself.  If the move on the underlying to make profit on the option is getting unreasonable it’s time to sell or accept expiring worthless.
So I understand the sub is hyping up GME because of the short squeeze but when exactly would I sell and how long would the squeeze even last? I’m new.
You could post in at least one of the two, if not both.
Made some good wins last week with the same tactics. I hope it will work again haha
I hate Aaron Rodgers. Literally my least favorite player in the NFL. But they’re winning today lol

Edit: my fucking prison ink is gone :/
Bad idea unless the Packers win.

Are you able to actually find the first time users commented or made a submission here?  That's interesting. I am definitely for this.

Totally depends on your risk tolerance and what you hope to do.  


At the end of the day, if you’re making money, you’re making money.  Don’t beat yourself up if you sell options for a profit. With one bad day, options can go to zero, so selling for a profit is always a win.  


If you sell shares early... well, scold yourself a little bit for that one.  


I would consider selling the $40 call if/when GME spikes up this week. And then use the proceeds to buy shares & another higher call. But everything is subjective, so if GME spikes to the moon (well into triple digits), I would just call it a win & move on, or just do shares if it looks like it will keep squeezing. If it only jumps to $50, then that’s not a full squeeze & I would then do the longer dated calls & shares - like mentioned earlier.
Dude. It's a value play inside a squeeze play. We should be 50 on fundamentals. At least. If news like this was true and got out, shorts are dead. Squeeze soon.
Not to get too philosophical but I would say the now is more important than the forward. Yes you should have goals to strive for but Life itself is now. 

Too many people live to retire. Life is like music and the whole purpose is to dance.

$500 up! 5 3/19 $10 calls and 80 shares.
Also there must be a lot of new retail participants outside wsb looking at the recent price increase, thinking this is the next blockbuster and initiating new short positions. Lots of noise on Stocktwits, Twitter, YouTube in support of this. They will certainly be affected by this and be forced to cover.

Depends where you live. My tenants pay 33k+ a year for my old house in San Diego. They could not afford to buy my house in today's market.
I only have about 10k of my 230ish on GME and I feel like a pussy

Been reading a ton of stuff about how the $15/hr bill will unequivocally spike inflation, drive up costs and competition for low end housing, while spiking layoffs to offset costs for companies that can’t pass the expense off to the consumers. 

Basically it’s gonna bring forth an era where only Walmart & Amazon can afford to play the game because of volume. Oh, and $12 Big Macs. 

Soo, it should be interesting.
Cramer even explains himself how they rig it here. He knows how it’s basically illegal, but admits he did it just because the SEC doesn’t understand the methods. So maybe after leaving that behind, he understands. He’s sort of with us. Good video of him explaining.

I’ve made the most money of 2020 on NIO. Bought a ton of stock and several nov calls when it was at $14. Sold option at $20, in retrospect, like an idiot but an idiot that cleared good money. Sold all NIO shares premarket yesterday and am out on it. Feel like it’s a (redacted) flip between hitting $100 by March and possibility of waking up one morning at it going from $60 to $30 before you can even get out due to some fucked up China related shit. Will always love my little Chinese EVs, but agreed, shits too spooky now.

I mean theoretically it could but I feel like the stock is riding the hype wave right now. I have no doubts that crispr is the future, but I have to wonder if right now the backing for the technology is a bit premature (mainly talking about Cathie). I work in biotech and understand the limitations associated with delivery and efficacy of drugs. Nothing is ever straightforward and I'm not sure how many of the current people invested are there for the long haul. Just my 2 cents.
Any of you dweebs actually daytrade or make a living on just trading? It seems like the most useful skill to master. Obviously it takes years but once you have it you can work pretty much anywhere and nothing can take that away from you... so long as the market is around.

I have the same tickers but July 21 expiration AAPL 130 and SNAP 55
buy OTM and roll them higher as they go in the money. take profit and juice the position at the same time
Haha no. I’m up big and getting more
Also I can’t see an actual investor deciding the middle of a short squeeze is the best time to establish a position, if people are getting in for the long haul they’re probably waiting for it to return to normalcy.
I'm happy for him. Diamond hands paid off and hey, he's one of us. Full retard. Probably a safe bet though because anything Elon touches or talks about turns to gold.

I did exact same thing with wish, sold my 20c for a loss the same day it shot up to $27... lost 80x2 and put a sell on one for $10 loss and was hoping hmm atleast I will only lose $10 on one. the price of the calls were 3x what I sold. It is what it is

Great post! Now what is this about an ambulance driver?
Cramer was floating the idea to GME to issue more stock this week on his TV show.

Wouldn't that be sad if GME just creates another X multi million shares which inadvertently lets the shorters unwind and the wave becomes a gentle ripple in the water?
Definitely long term, got mad FOMO watching the other ARK trains leave the station and don’t want to miss this one.

Where can I look up when the shorts expire?
This is very helpful.

Looks like for every LEAP (average cost 1100 for 2022 20c) I could sell 30c (way OTM) weeklies against it for 24 bucks credit. 5 LEAPS...120 bucks a week-ish so it would take 10 weeks to get another LEAP. 10 LEAPS at 240 a week would be 5 weeks. Not bad. Does this sound right or am I missing something?

I appreciate your help on this!

I am a lemming with 💎 🙌. Holding.
I have but I think I don’t know enough still. Maybe that’s the unknown that I can’t see. I’m trying to spot blind spots with very limited knowledge but this who thing. but I’ve only been investing 4 months. I’ve not even begun to grasp options and how the Greeks work etc. So I’d only go shares until I’ve read enough. 

Regardless of whether an investment position is taken or not is still compelling to see to the end as it’s just an interest situation brewing. I hope the institutional shorters get fucked and retail and GameStop win this. A warning shot that shorters are not invincible in definite. 👍🏼
Pretty sure nobody predicted the exact date but there numerous DD’s on GME before referencing Ryan Cohen “secretly” buying a huge amount of GME stock. Basically saying he grew Chewy and now he is going for GME and why it’s a buy. Don’t have a link now but you can find those DD’s and other lurkers can confirm

2x *longer.
That would be true if shorts needed to be backed 1:1 by actual shares. What we're effectively looking at is some number of shares being shorted twice or more, since all you *really* need is a % of the position value on margin, not the share itself. Or, as I read charmingly expressed here, "shadow jutsu shares"
They talk about hate on Twitter? Maybe we should flood Cramer with some autistic ❤️ and he will start to fight our battle for us on TV
I used hitfilm express. Downloaded it this morning, watched a 10 minute tutorial and threw this together. Part 2 will be a 10 fold better
Pltr is a long, long hold. At least 2 more years, if not 4 or 5. They themselves have said that their software was made 5 years before the world needed it, meaning it will take time for it to ingratiate into all major corporations that need such data analysis.
My only concern is the lockup expiry as I have a lot of shares and may have to think of a trailing stop limit sell so I can buy back more shares if the price drops.

Shot at least you’re reading the DD. A lot of the new r/all crowd on here is just going to read this thread and lose everything in less than a month.
You know he’s on to something...short term sure there’s a massive short squeeze, but long term do you expect a brick and mortar store to be surviving the current generalized customer behavior shift? Ffs everyone buys everything online and “online stores” don’t have to pay rent or min wage to our brother retards working minimum wage there

I’d be taking profits during this short squeeze bc this can go to the moon BUT the trend shouldn’t invert

TLDR: make money on puts when the squeeze is over
How’s my 1/29 calls looking?

Wall street should be open on Monday. What's bidens plan for this 😤
pornhub
Bloomberg alr reported it
Also in October, the deal with MSFT was [announced](https://news.microsoft.com/2020/10/08/gamestop-announces-multiyear-strategic-partnership-with-microsoft/).

They’re shifting all their business operations to the Microsoft 365 stack, including CRM Dynamics.  They’ll be setup for better data driven decisions and collaboration.  It also equips all staff with Surface devices on the sales floor.  Maybe something like the Apple store where there’s not really a register anymore.  Just checkout with the employee anywhere.

This deal also includes a GME cut of all digital sales from Xboxes sold from GME for the life of the console.  That’s some nice extra revenue for essentially little effort.  And this happened in October!  I’m wondering if we’ll see how much they made from that deal with nextgen console sales in their next quarterly.
$GME theory, sounds great 🚀 

But yeah you’re probably right. I want to stand out, if I have a math background which I am relatively good at I should be able to have something to put on my resume
Instead of calling people paper-handed bitches, you should encourage people to buy the dips and not buy the ATHs. As tempting as it is to get everyone on board and push it up ASAP, you are setting people up for failure and those people will defect when they're down 20-30% and hurt the goal of pushing it up. 

If you are a nervous-nelly / paper-hand or unwilling to hold on for several months, please buy the dips. Don't buy the momentum.

If it was bought with cash, he would be subject to personal income tax.

Just found this


deal includes around $2 billion in cash from the private equity firms, while the remainder is stock and/or retention packages. [Update: Another source says that Volition just sent out letters to limited partners, saying the full purchase price will be paid in cash at closing.
Finding a way to make money and not working for anyone is the way. Even better if you have a passion for something. Trading could provide that avenue if one was serious about it.
If your weekly at 35 dollar strike gets called, you shouldn't be sad lol? That's an insane delta gain from the underlying. Furthermore u can just buy back at a dip since if it hit 35 dollar in a week, a pullback would probably present itself. (Like it did so many times before after breaking ~29)

Any idea how the transition of Trump to Biden will impact the market? I think historically it goes down due to uncertainty and this means the bears will win and avoid a nasty squeeze.

RMO has a $234 MILLION contract from Lion Electric and some nice contracts with other EV companies! It seems to be getting some love from Cramer (mentioned the company in a positive way on his show a couple of days ago + tweeted an article about them yesterday). Also seems to be liked by some popular twitter accounts that talk about stocks. + It dropped rather quickly from its all time high to current prices, could be an oversold play. MONEY TIME MOFUCKAS

LEAPS are much easier to hold once you’re up on them. Personally I don’t think diamond handing long term contracts is particularly impressive if you’re already up over 1000%.
YO RC IS THIS POST TRUE?
I hate you. But have a up vote.
Honest question. I have a 42c expriring in april. Ive never played deep itm calls. What are the chances there are just no buyers on that contract and then IV shits itself.
I usually threaten them with physical violence and then ignore them afterwards, I call it the “Chris Brown”
You seem to have spent more time thinking about this than most on WSB, I think you have a good idea of your risks. I am sure you will make the right decision for your situation. Just don't buy calls, the situation is too volatile to predict and the cost of calls right now are through the roof.

Go for Mathematical Economics, imo.

Probably cooler Game Theory in there while Financial Economics sounds like boring ass accounting lmao
I mean I didnt want to use my profits to buy back in to not have this shit spike

So obviously wasnt a big loss (maybe not yet) but this sub has me all in on GME, obviously i check the charts lol but i guess the hold in the 30s is a good thing a bit out of my mind after that godly spike

It's very important to understand that when Melvin does a short sale on the equity they are essentially selling non existant shares to then open market trying to drive the price down...its an expensive manipulation strategy. Also, when they sell puts, MMs need to hedge which also drives the price down.

TLDR, there is no price target. If we all put sell limit orders at 420, then that's the price target. That's the price Melvin has to pay to close their shorts.

Wow a whole 0.1% up. So you can get 0.35% return v 0.25% return.
Thanks for the DD. What options you looking at?

Well, if I said that, I certainly didn't say it before Cohen stated he was going to do something that actually isn't possible yet. And the price did double so... 1 for 2!
Post a better screenshot or ban. This could very well be paper trading.
Idk man. I bought PLTR calls and sold them a day before the big purchase by Cathie Woods. It's kind of really really sad. Why would I sell call options that expire on FEB 12? $26C. I literally sold 2 days after purchase for a loss of like $70 I think. I'm so fucking stupid

You should read Reminisces of a Stock Market Operator if you haven’t. Cornering a market does work but working an exit requires having a market to sell into. Easier in commodities than stocks. You won’t be able to maintain cartel discipline into $420, and even if you do, you’ll need buyers after. Institutional shorts aren’t dumb and will hedge or exit before.

Dude, this makes so much sense.
It still doesn’t explain the MASSIVE buying that happened Wednesday if huge short positions weren’t closed. Don’t get me wrong, I want this thing to pop over $100, but I think it’s disingenuous to not consider that there hasn’t been a large short cover already. 180 million shares traded Wednesday alone, I just don’t have any real data that says the large shorts are still underwater until we get reliable short interest data.

You really do wake up one day and realize you left the rockstar phase of your life...

If you’re in college, fight with everything you have to stay there as long as possible. Take minimum credits, take semesters off, hell even get suspended as long as it doesn’t jeopardize the diploma. 

A guy once told me “once you join the workforce it’s all over” and I didn’t really take it to heart. I thought “oh this guy isn’t as successful as I will be” or “I’m so great I can turn any environment into an awesome one”...

Well guess what, that motherfucker was exactly right. The workplace is a bland, depressing, neutered environment that **will** erode your enthusiasm and passion. This is a structural necessity of 99% work environments. You will not change this no matter how awesome of a person you are. 

Long story short, put off graduating as long as humanly possible. Because once you do, it truly is all over...
Dude I joined a random discord this guy was telling us plays on options. He for fun, said buy a SPY 420C back when spy was down at like 250 during Covid. If I held on it would’ve been similar gains. It was like a 1/29 2021 expiry costing like 9 cents!

Bolt 24s only good thing is less sugar. Also I dont know why its got caffeine in it.

BodyArmor gets its electrolytrs through potasium and is 10% coconut water. Tastes amazing. No artificial coloring.
If the contract holder does not exercise it, you keep the shares and the premium! Technically, the only realized gain is from the premium. The rest of your profits are unrealized as you have not sold the shares in this scenario. You still hold the 100 shares at whatever price they are at when the contract expires.

Not if they don't stock anything though.  I guess I'm not seeing the appeal of walking into a brick and mortar store down the street to use a kiosk to place and order for a part or system that will be shipped to my house.  Isn't that what a website is from home?

Not trying to shit on GME here, I'm literally all in, but them getting rid of toys and candy and shit, and replacing it all with stocked PC parts you can take home that day sounds more appealing to me.

Yes exactly. And while I think the outcome is obvious, this is a once in a lifetime situation. They illegally shorted shares they hadn't bothered to borrow. This is something WSB would do, not a financial institution. Yet here we are. And there are STILL people betting Gamestop will go bankrupt.

Someone said GME at $400 would represent a 20 billion dollar market cap. Or a 20 Brazilian Market Cap...Not sure, but the point I’m trying to make here is why the f$&k can I not buy a Xbox X without losing said Brazilian?
Legggggggoooooooooooo 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚🌚
bearish short term
With short interest being over 100,  that would mean All of GME capitol is on loan.  Correct?

It's very important to understand that when Melvin does a short sale on the equity they are essentially selling non existant shares to then open market trying to drive the price down...its an expensive manipulation strategy. Also, when they sell puts, MMs need to hedge which also drives the price down.

TLDR, there is no price target. If we all put sell limit orders at 420, then that's the price target. That's the price Melvin has to pay to close their shorts.

to all of you who are thinking about selling GME, trust the process. A couple weeks ago, people bought at $22 and sold for a massive loss. Yesterday several people bought at $38 and probably sold at $32 for a massive loss. Those paper handed pussies could have been in the deep green right now, but they have no faith.

When the squeeze happens, I'm pretty sure that I'll still be happy I did it. If PLTR outpaces GME, I'll be a little sad, but I'm already up a substantial amount & if it moons really hard I'm looking at a potential 7 figure payday.
LEAPs should do well, though I'd probably go into ERIC instead, they're a stronger company in general.
So do we sell when it spikes or hold for a couple of months???

So let’s just say I bought 100shares of ABC for $10per share, and I sell a call with a $20 strike price. So a month later ABC is at $15per share and the call is about to expire so he does not execute it. Do I make $500 on the 100 shares that I have because it went up $5? Or do I just make the money from the premium?
I tried calling some stores and they dont know shit 😫
Yea I’m a bit new when it comes to puts and calls as well can anyone help me lmao. I just got 200 shares tho so let’s fucking goooo GameStop actusly giving me money after all the years of the opposite

On the other hand, we can't lock down the floating shares because we'll have a bunch of people paper handing and getting margin called. The increased liquidity will likely be an even stronger effect than the short interest difference.

You didn't have some financial guy from Porsche going "whoops just paper handed 10m shares lol!" to his boss, because, you know... that's his ass.
Thanks for the reply. What’s the 4S you mentioned? Can’t find it on google
LOL you’re actually fucked in the head. i literally said the only thing GME has going for them is their high short float. if investors realize that their shorts are covered, it’s all downhill for them. 

not once did i say their shorts were covered.

you also talk from authority to prove your point as if you know how this market works.

you also compared a matured industry to a growth/speculative industry which is laughable. how stupid can one be? lol

Since the short interested jumped up to a **WHOPPING 79 MILLION SHARES SHORT** I don't think your Friday summary is correct. Seems like the 🌈🐻 are in full blown panic mode atm. **10 million shares short than exist, 79 million total shares short on a 24 million(ish) float is, well INSANE**

What happens when **Team Chewy** tops up another 7%?

I see an Aug 21 exp (rather than a 17th) , but it appears to me that the break even on that play is 3038.

So if amzn doesn't hit 3199(best case) by Feb 19th, are you just cashing out at that point? Or are you going to ride the remaining aug call into the sunset?
If you’re referring to gme then there’s two sides to this. 1) a lot of brokers have made margin maintenance for gme at 100% this past week, meaning if you bought gme on margin then you better make sure you have enough cash in your brokerage account to cover your gme shares. They will usually give you some time to cover, usually about 2-3 business days. If you do not cover then your brokerage will market sell your shares, which could flood the market with gme shares and drive the stock down. 2)Short sellers will see this and try to enter a short position while it’s going down, driving the stock lower. Well with the uptick rule short sellers can’t enter a short position while it’s going down or on a down tick, they will have to wait until gme has a up tick to short the stock. 

TL;DR let’s hope most of the gme 💎🙌shareholders can cover their margin call.

The problem is that there were two times in that span where it went green momentarily but then it crashed again. I was done trying to time it so I let it sit. It was a large percentage of my investment money too. 

In December of 2018, I used a microcrash to average down my position. Now that prices are up to 3 year highs, my now large position is paying off and I am very glad I held. I should note that I locked in a $3k loss on it in March to free up some capital for other trades. But now I have more than covered that loss with recent price action.
Someone's about to be a GameStop bitch 😩🐳🐳
I agree with you bearish sentiment for Friday. I just need to figure out when to sell my 1/22 20c and when to buy back in on shares to really profit from the squeeze. I’m thinking of converting the profit into ~35-40 shares and another option for around March or April

For sure. But the manager seemed convinced they were pushing forward. Go call your local GME stores and see what they say.
Be the retarded reddit bit you want to see.
Probably not legal for a huge bank to buy shares in an attempt to squeeze. But a lot of little guys wanting to *profit* off a squeeze is legal. If the sum of these little guys contributes to the squeeze. Well, so be it.



Also: The profit from the squeeze for a bank would be low, a few million in profits is nothing to them. They peobably focus on bigger plays. And they have laws & regulation as well as internal rules about what assets they can buy in what amounts
No they didn't. Amazon and Walmart were different business models - one was entirely online and the other was entirely in-store. Also Bezos is a different animal to the Fubo ceo, whose name really doesn't deserve to be in this sentence. You're just saying shit to justify the short squeeze but whoever participates in this is going to get so burned, they won't come within an inch of this sub again.
it's possible the squeeze finished thursday, IBKR reporting shares are available for borrowing indicating a ton of covering already happened

Im buying calls though, no way I'm buying shares to pump up the price and let you get away with all the derivative tendies yourself.
Look at it this way.  

How many weeklies would you have to sell to buy another leap?  

What is the chances of the leap being liquidated if the weeklies hit?

If the aggregate risk of the leap being liquidated for the period it would take you to earn enough premiums to buy another leap is less that 1, it’s a good play.

Of course, you may want to use a different number than 1, depending on your tolerance, or free cash to buy the weekly back if the stonk moves against you short term.

What if we’re higher than 50s before the end of the week? I’ve seen some people talking about possible 100+ a share. Is that realistic or even possible at this point?
> Also, with getting rid of margin- say I bought or shorted @ 15 and price is now 35, do I have to make up the 15 or make up the 35?

Depends on if you're long or short

- If you're long you borrowed 15$/share for your initial investment and are required to maintain some maintenance collateral (lets say 75%). If margin req goes to 100% you now have to cover that $15, regardless of the current share price. If you bought 100 shares on margin your maintenance req is $1125, after the change to 100% margin requirement your maintenance req is now $1500 (+$375).

- If you're short you borrowed the share at $15, you had some initial margin requirement, and the ongoing maintenance requirement will be some percentage of the current stock price (50-75%?). So someone who was short 100 shares at $15 with prior maintenance requirement 75% has had their maintenance requirement increase from $1125 to $2625 with the price move and to $3500 with maintenance requirement change to 100% ($875).

- Actual figures depend heavily on entry point and current price. Please don't use this information to inform your trades.

TLDR: Longs have to make up $15. Shorts have to make up $35. Given these numbers, shorts need almost 3 times more capital per share than longs to maintain their margin requirements. See bullet point 3.

How much? Did you ever think it would’ve been better to take the loss and use the freed capital for other profits? Might’ve made back your loss with that money instead of it being ‘blocked’ for so long? Interested to hearing
Ouch...bad decision. Next week will be rotation week where hot hands move from GME to PLTR. GME will still be up but PLTR will crush it and you'll FOMO.

BB is now a tech company. They do cyber security, and make software. Also John Chen is their CEO. He got deals with Amazon and now Sony as well to do their self driving technology. I bought 100 shares. It’s a hidden gem. Get it while you can 🚀🚀🚀
They are buying up shares. You think wsb was the reason behind over the 100M volume on Thursday?
Yeah, they dont take fees until I sell so if I never sell🤔

Attack on Melvin
Looks like oil prices going up tho? Could b their time during Q1. Gotta find the undervalued stuff, I think  Sony is undervalued from a tech and innovation standpoint—they are prob gonna come out with an EV and I would guess flying car. Another i have been huge on CRISPR gene editing stocks but some reason sold a bunch pre covid. Should’ve held. I would be rich. Only have crsp of the three I used to own. That stuff is pretty mind-blowing. The tech’s ability to remove disease from human and non-human genes is simply unfathomable. I love Tesla for its innovation always thought it was previously undervalued. CRSP, at least the crispr tech, analogous to Tessie imo. Queen Cathy ran up its prices but I don’t think it’s even begun to run

[deleted]
The longer it stays up, the more the pressure shifts. It just shot up a ridiculous amount in 2 days, that would always make pressure downwards. The huge short % would also make pressure downwards. But the existence of a huge short % in the context of consistent gains for the past 6 months (I think) makes upward pressure as well.

Any real galvanizing event/news would definitely shift it upwards.
Congrats on your success!! Nice gain porn!! Don’t listen to these jealous retards!!

yes, and my question is which firms exactly do this reporting? Because the NYSE doesn't seem to do it, and many of these websites reporting info don't say where the info is from, and some say it's "estimated", without saying what exactly that is taken to mean
This is beautiful
Those of you who end up getting another $1400 in Biden Bucks, what will you do with the money?
I'm a retard and just figured out your comment was satire. Carry on then..
I've been playing around the same scenarios in my head.

Their behavior could also depend on their strategy. Do they want to completely escape the trade/thesis or do they want to burn cash to buy themselves time, reduce volatility and big upward moves that would increase pressure/margin call potential and then resume their attack. Melvin has $20B AUM so that's a lot of capital to work with to weather out a storm.
Nice. We ride together.

Shhhh!!!!! This is more than just that. It’s a war with Melvin at this point.
No more upvotes. It says 69
LOL at everyone in WSB being like “yeah, I’m not selling GME until it hits $100, but if it looks like it’ll go to $150 I’ll probably diamond hand it”

You fucking donkeys, “yeah I guess if it goes up 300% that’s okay, but I want more”
What’s a “paragraph”?

Lmao what???
Luckily I’m hedging my portfolio with PLTR being 80% of it. Kick rocks retard 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
There's another point that's bad for straight shorting and that is that if you have a leap put and the stock goes up, you can't be margin called.

In the other hand, potentially you can 💎🙌 a short through a long time of a small amount of upward movement.

But I think the real reason bigger firms short shares is because they are far more liquid.

The market is always “buy the rumor, sell the news” well TSLA started a rumor that they would be making 100 billion a year in 9 years.... 


So, in my analysis, we have 8 more years of a bull run, or 8 more years to start a new rumor.  I like those odds.

20 covered calls on his 2000 shares. Makes no money beyond 15 but keeps premium if it doesn’t hit it.

Sold puts is long position. Makes money if BB goes up it stays the same but loses if BB drops a lot.
You might get lucky, sure. But set the limit too high, for too long and you might miss the frenzy. You may have to sell it at VM 29th price level. The candle wick/shadow is somewhat misleading. 1 share may have sold for $900+ (poor boomer). Someone with better data may shed more light to that aspect.

Buy shares of GME not calls 

shares not calls shares not calls
You got to wonder if I eventually you'll get somebody on here pumping it just to dump it reversing the Wall Street bets momentum
though i guess with GME it is a different case but i find it strange that all the DDs seem to recommend buying shares only rather than a mix of calls and shares 

calls would force more shares to get bought up by MMs and produce a squeeze quicker right? seems like the sentiment is right but so many members here have small accounts and would fare better buying long dated calls than buying shares if the goal is to produce a squeeze

I thought cash accounts were supposed to be fine as long as you don't have issues at the bank.
We will!
It's to hold the extra rocket fuel.
Huh? 30%? No cap tax???   
Last place I saw 30% on divs was Belgium.
Margin loans. When you have millions, banks fight to lend you money at 1% interest often using the stocks as collateral. Risk is when stock price collapse they will sell your shares to cover the loan. That's the risky bet since you'll be selling at the lows instead of at the highs.
With thay much money, why not put $1mil in a meme stock and write covered calls.  You can literally make 5 figs every few weeks.
I feel attacked
One of us...
You won't miss that 22k, especially in smaller bits month to month, but you might miss out on insane adventures that stay with you the rest of your life.
$250 net worth is still broke
Well, not with that attitude it isn't.
Sell 20% at $110. Then I'll decide what to do with the other 4000 shares.
Fair. As you noted, it depends on what those call holders do now. Exercise to keep float lower, close out and buy some stock with the gains, take their profits and run on to the next meme? Who knows...

SOLAR FREAKING ROADWAYS
I saw Cramer at a grocery store in New Jersey yesterday. I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything.
He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?”
I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying.
The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter.
When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.
I’ve got a quick question what happens to my 100shares in someone exercises the call?

Confirmed, ban this kid
Here's my tinfoil hat conspiracy theory.

What if RC had this whole thing planned out? We have the roller coaster tweet where he's like hold on, then on Friday we get news of directors selling, leading to a massive bear attack, and then...

Here's my interpretation:

The directors are in on this plan. They knew that news of them selling would cause the price to drop, making the bears think they have the advantage, causing them to overleverage and trigger SSR rule, taking away their ammo on Tuesday.

Notice how they didn't sell THAT much stock, they still have sizeable portfolios (someone correct me if I'm wrong).

RC acquires shares at a discount on Friday and then news comes out over the weekend, triggering panic buying. Now bears have less ammo to suppress price because of SSR and are scrambling to cover, causing the MOASS to begin.

If true, that would be some true 4d chess! I can only dream!

Positions: 2200 shares and a few more calls. LFG GME!!  🚀
One of his new 5G etf plays uploaded on yt yesterday
tell your brothers this stock is gonna rise up🚀🚀🚀like they won’t even believe✈️✈️✈️just rise up🚀🚀🚀rise up🚀✨🌚
This theory holds based on the assumption of continued buying Tues. and Wed.  With paper handed bitches, and the latest media run up, big boys would not want to touch this with a 10ft. pole unless of a news catalyst.

What do you think will drive the price up, ex Papa Cohen releases news of a share buy? 

I feel that there is more downward pressure in price due to what you're saying, than upward pressure in price.  I could be totally wrong however.

Current Position: 4,700 shares.
The rest have merely adopted it
Yeah their products are next gen no doubt
I did ~$5k Friday morning at ~$38.50, watched it drop and trade sideways and got nervous. I’m such a rookie

No, its a cash account. I just did too many day trades
Graph says it hit $912 high on the 28th, I wonder how long it stayed that high, an hour? Three? 10 minutes?
is something happening?
I've read about the uptick rule, but I'm not sure it makes a lot of sense to me. So ultimately it eliminates rampant shorting to manipulate the price, which would alleviate downward pressure while the rule is in place, correct?

People talk about it like it's a huge bullish flag, but it seems that really it just eliminates a bearish indicator. Does that seem right? And if so, what effects do you anticipate we'll see on Tuesday?
Hi burry
Bro, YOURE that reddit bot
Something that makes a random dirty poem using every letter in your username or every letter in stock symbols in the post for each line.
Pissed my pants watching this.
They don’t have to buy up shares yet though. They can create a price ceiling by shorting every time it tries to go up on Tuesday and hope it deters large buying accumulation for the rest of the week. Could easily be a boring week of consolidation without a new catalyst.
Been in this since march, started at 5$ but have since avg'd up and down to land at about 7$ for 820 shares.

LETS FUCKING GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO
this may be a dumb question but i haven’t seen anyone mention it before. is it possible for the GME squeeze not to happen? it feel inevitable that it will, but i’m interested to know if it’s possible for it not to happen.
Will there be more blood in the market next week? I loaded some faang stocks to swing n they dipped more 😂😂
It’s gonna go up 57% in a day and they’re not gonna sell, then it’l slowly trickle down to $20

*oh wait*
r/boobs
r/thetagang my man

Pmcc
Why would I not sell at the $100-300 spike and buy back at the dip before the big squeeze? Seems like a no brainer to expand the size of my slice of the pie.  Too risky to try at this point?
But, if MMs try to short it even further after Tuesday they could drive it down more.
I figured it out. You could
Have just told me. It would
Have been quicker.
I get more cash come Monday. Will buy truckloads $bb, tendies, printer go brrrr? 🚀🚀🚀
Pltr is definitely $100 in a year
just buy now later you will be retired .
Not gonna happen unless a black sheep scenario occurs
So will they sell easy?
Last night I was having full blown auditory hallucinations.  I heard Cramer screaming at me. It was strange to say the least

Why do the shares have 6 decimals?
I just went to my local GameStop. There were 5 other customers in the store, all of whom looked like they were about to drop some dough. Long $GME
This is actually huge, see people don’t understand the niche of the gaming market. They want to buy and support someone who understands them. GameStop revolutionizing themselves into a one stop bestbuy but nerdier is going to be huge and that doesn’t consider all the e-commerce

That and computers are like phones, everyone wants the latest and greatest
$100m / ($100/share) =1m shares

Like whats really the end goal here for all you guys invested in GME? I'm just curious what the end game is?
If by works you mean if your immune system got triggered, then you should check if your muscle is feeling a little stiff and/or is swollen after the injection. Maybe you have a small fever as well and/or you feel a little achy this are good signs as well. If it works as advertised, it's about a  10x reduction of the probability to get infected.  Since you might have daily exposure if course you shouldn't let your guard down. Then there's also the risk that one of these mutations manages to bypass the immune response of vaccinated people as well.
Anyone else spend all their time here when pooping. It’s 50/50 here and r/gothsluts
You can be rehypothecated into 0 if doing it on margin in a Lehman brothers scenario, but not if not on martin. When not on margin, in theory you’d have cash collateral in exchange and worst in financial oblivion get hit with a realized gain and owe tax. It also causes dividends to have less favorable taxation if you receive a kickback in lieu of dividend. But mostly it’s just profit. Ibkr has full disclosure you’d read to sign up outlining this in more detail and clarity.
Either which way it goes you will have taken part of something that they write about on the stuff I wipe my ass with. Your story will touch my taint.

They advised parents of autistic children to go through the 5 stages of grief (like you would if your kid DIED).

They support, endorse and receive funding from the judge rotenberg centre who keep torturing and murdering autistic children.

And yeah theyre utterly fascinated by collecting the genetic data of every autistic person in the world.

Much better than the Ross and T J Maxx which look like an unkempt after Black Friday sale, Walmart. One step down from Home Goods but with a much larger selection. Only half the stuff has been opened or used upon markdown. At 0.10 a share and held by the penny stock king of hedges. How could this not be a buy?

Yeah functionally I think this might even still be better than how it was in Feb and March with all the FUD.  Euphoria is annoying but the constant sky was falling was way worse in my opinion. 

Although the media attention has made things more obnoxious that normal, but way I look at it is if you have to be constantly validated about your positions they are probably not all that great and long term that comes around.  Additionally if you are that emotionally invested in them, you won’t be able to cut the thread when they turn and it will blow up the account.

How are you accurately figuring out institutional ownership when institutions hold 110% of all outstanding shares (which sounds bonkers)?

[https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/gme/institutional-holdings)

I guess you're just taking the top ones, but the 110% number has me going o.O
No no, you're thinking of the Tesla Model GME. Elon is buying game stop and plans to bring Elder Scrolls 7 to your dashboard. It comes with tendie holders and has diamonds etched into the steering wheel grip.
But why shares when I can buy calls 😎
Appreciate all the good information!
Cheers dude. I know its unlikely to happen within 1 month straight away but I'm happy to keep rolling and rolling over with the kind of potential payoff I see. If it takes a year, okay.

In my original post that was removed I had also noted that the stock had rallied 100% within 12 months with short interest starting to tick down slight over the period which might point to a greater breaking point with the shorts soon to come. 

I agree it's over priced but that hasn't seemed to matter for much of anything lately 🤷‍♂️ the momo is there. It has been gaining 5-6% on days with no news and even with the market down Friday it finished up 1%. Again to me pointing to the shorts getting a little exhausted and reaching breaking point.

Funds (people) aren't supposed to do a lot of things but that doesnt stop them from trying or doing them or just straight up lying about their intentions.

Appreciate your take on it ✌
ITM has a higher delta and moves with the stock price while being more protected from losing value to the other Greeks. It’s like buying 100 shares at a discount so long as the price goes up

Hi, I’m new here, and the post gave me one thought: what?
Any downward price pressure is 100% coming from the US, not Europe. Almost every day of the past week, MT opens green in Europe, then when it's red in US premarket and at open, it goes red in Europe.

If Ryan Cohen buys those 7% of shares and triggers the squeeze, he will be famous for all time. Economics books and lectures will talk about him forever. WE will  make history. The SEC will have to make some changes to the rules because of him.
Why so far out?
thank you good sir
Those are my second favorite
At this point I’m convinced It’s not only us.

WSB is almost like an echo chamber where we thought we are the only the force behind the MOASS, but this information is almost public now, brother Cramer praised it in the show and I’m sure that there are outside whale who saw this coming and scoop all the shares up past days.

If you been following all the GME post, DD, etc. would you not want to take a bet? Let’s say you have 10 mil in the market and you comfortable to lose 1% of that money, downside is losing probably what, 20%, 30% of that fuck you money? Upside is the MOASS that can multiply to 5x-10x and the feeling that you beat the short sellers

This is a share play not option play, my position is very small but I yolo my savings into this play.

yeah i kept tellin myself that for a few weeks one time with aapl. it's old and crippled with a bent cook and doesn't like to move too much.
This is not true as of yesterday.  I spoke to Fidelity rep who confirmed they are still 30% margin.
I think the margin requirement is already super high on RH of you're holding GME. If used about 18k in margin and my margin maintenance amount is about 16.6k
GME gang and BB gang need to work together now. BB has the potential to make us all fat tendies. It’s so cheap now and undervalued. It will 🚀

The uptick rule shouldn’t matter much. There’s still up bids and the dealers can ignore it. I don’t think they are held to it anyway and they are net long currently. Buying at the money puts can cause lots of selling.

One of the fed chairmen loosely discussed having to tighten sooner than expected. Then was promptly scolded in public by JPow. I don't think we are anywhere close to having to tighten but I don't think it'll be three years either.
One thing though is that GME will be traded on other exchanges (e.g. Frankfurt) on Monday. Not sure how that affects things.

I believe the logic is if you have enough capital, you can short partially, less than the full collateral needed, and hope to cover if needed by selling other assets when needed.

Wow. You did amazing. I guess having some cash to start with helps a bit. Only got $500 to use rn.. Even making 20% last month. I don't see the millions yet haha. Hope I can save $500 more for stocks this year. Good job anyway!! 👍
SEC triggered a 201. How will they manipulate down without margin? And all the while FOMOs and YOLOs  tripping over themselves to get in, while simultaneously shorts are forced to cover?

This happens when people view political stances as their identities. People who get mad at protests are just yelling ‘NO ONE LOVES ME/PAY ATTENTION TO ME”
When you have 4.5m sitting around to wipe your ass with it isn't difficult to set it and forget it. You boomer'd that 9M with leaps
presidents are just one factor out of thousands. they are important and their policies matter, but you think it was bill clinton who was responsible for the dotcom bubble run up? or trump responsible for booming tech? as long as the feds and president plan to leave things mostly alone and keep current rates (hint: biden will) then the other factors far outweigh this. trump pump idiots and biden stock market doomers both probably have red accounts and are coping hard core.

This sounds very 🌈
The premium I receive for selling the covered calls can mathematically be removed from my overall cost basis. You then re-divide that by the amount of shares you own and you get your adjusted cost basis.
Don't act like a bitch a explain if you know
WHERE THE FUCK ARE THE ROCKET EMOJIS!?  HOW AM I SUPPOSE TO UNDERSTAND THIS!?

It depends but often yes. Look at all of the people on here buying options. So many of them expire worthless. Why scratch lottery tickets when you can be the one selling the tickets?
New 188M contract ..... so that's a solid 10% in the red.
Lol. There is no DD here. AWS news was December.
Nah, make it a fresh gift card as an extra “fuck you”. Can’t spend the gift card money to buy puts in gme, can only spend money to increase the profit that GameStop makes (like buying 0.05 of a ps5). The irony
Probably due to the timing of a negative event or something
It seems it breaks the rules of the sub.
Can some explain how exchanges can you short more that 100% of available shares? That confuses me. I recall ing the number of shares shorted was over 100%
The reason for that is that insiders are just allowed to sell a certain percentage of their shares at once. That doesn't mean that they hold their shares because of the reasons you mentioned. I'm still long on GME but your post is just incorrect.

[deleted]
The most important part of this post, IMO, is **new shorts**. Most people don't think of that. Just because there's a ton of bulls doesn't mean we are short on bears. Go anywhere else and all they talk about is cigar butt.

I think the MOASS is not likely on price action alone. If there is a bullish day and during the day some big operational news strikes, that could do it. Like they announce a partnership with Sony on software sales and a new JV in esports with Team Liquid or something totally unforeseen. 

Until then, it's not likely that anything triggers a full on 5x or more price move based on pricing alone. Tuesday with uptick rule should be an interesting sight to behold. Wednesday I think updated short interest reporting comes out, and if it's over 100% you could see speculative appetite increase.
[deleted]
Excellent write up and thanks for the articulate explanation of the gamma effects here. Definitely a follow.
More. Always more.
It won't be a better deal than the squeeze.
yeah i would thing, that’s the thing—speaking as someone who knows nothing⁠, wsb has much more power buying OTM calls and forcing funds to hedge by buying shares than we ever would just buying those shares ourselves

right?
This was done in iMovie.
Sue a bunch of retards, surely that will hold up in court, come and get my .69 cents in my Robinhood account you f4ggots
Replying to my own question after researching a bit: 

Couldn't find their borrowing price, but their short position was "first reported" in Q4 2015. Price was in the mid 40s around then, and in the last two months of 2015 dropped sharply to upper 20s... I would assume a lag in between their having established the position and being obligated to report it, which would mean it was in the 40s when they borrowed it?

They're responsible for 5.4 million of the 71.2 million shares short. 

numbers from here [https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings\_tab\_link](https://whalewisdom.com/filer/melvin-capital-management-lp#tabholdings_tab_link) and here [https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/key-statistics/)

No but Google can
I prefer to insert dominance
I wouldn’t sell. You could be right and save like 6%, which isn’t a lot of money, or the stock could go up 20%. If you believe in it long term, which people smarter than you do, you should hold. I’m not selling unless it’s over 500$. And I have over 5700 shares.

Long term everything is pointing to it going up, even without the short squeeze it should be higher than 60$.

34 is the bottom I believe, I’m personally buying at those levels.
This one is really good, thanks
If you have a stock you think will go up but not by too much, sure.

Let's breakup WSB into groups of 100k people. You only interact with people from your group for lets say, 2 weeks at a time. Then based on something random, you pick another group to join and leave the current one.

Im a very tall midget, but so are you.
Two questions. 

1. I read through a lot of comments but nobody is talking the Diamond hands you have to have in order to hold such huge gains for so long...  am I off here?
2. Kind of related to 1, but could this be part of an advanced option trade and the other half is close to equal his gain?
Didn't know about the margin thing.. is that true? I bought 45 shares -- $750 in and $750 in margin. I dont' want to sell, I can get the equity from other stonks but I'm deep in the meme stocks and I don't want to give those up.
Bush was 39%
Obama was 28%
Trump was 21%

Biden now back to 28%

SIE is cool because it’s only 60$ and available to everyone. 

SIE + Series 65 and you can become a registered investment advisor (RIA), and operate independently. 
The requirements in some states are relatively lax. There are usually minor net worth requirements (not crazy, like 35K) and they need RIA’s to have some sort of liability coverage so getting an L.L.C. (Not expensive depending on state)
That’s what I’m thinking

Yeah, they liked us when we threw everything into SPY calls. Now, they see we made our own money printer and if we pull off some wins we could legit be rich and even more retarded. The autism plays work because we have learned to not panic by holding calls until expiration. We have no sense of emotion now due to this, and we become like autistic savants whose only skill is pressing buy on GME, yet it will work.

What kind of autistic question is that? His first orders of business are increased stimmy checks to the people, and massive infrastructure spending.

Raising taxes as the Bear case is a red herring. Taxes will still be lower than before Trump, and the market did just fine with 35% corporate tax rate, so I don't see how a 25% corporate tax will tank the markets

Got it. I’m setting a buy on August calls for $TUES morning.
Hm, sad. Would love to hear more to calm me down.

Im not sure anymore if i just participated in a big pump and we are already dumping.

Try to go all in with your net worth + margin, maybe you will feel better.

We had nowhere near the participation required to make it work. New Zealand did it right and they're on the other side now. We're gonna keep half-assing it for another year.
Your memes have gotten pretty 🔥 dube
You misspelt 🚀🚀🚀
They dump the shares as people unwind or rotate positions.  I suspect the initial selling was mis-interpretation of the director form 4s around selling shares, and then the later selling was related to option unwind. And there was net selling of course, but a stronger underlying bid than I expected.

Welcome to WSB
God forbid someone has a different opinion than you. Look captain I'm with you here thinking this could go higher, but the people calling bullshit on this squeeze continuing have a different opinion and who knows maybe they turn out to be right. Doesn't make it a cOnspIraCy just because there are all kinds of opinions. Some of them are just salty that they missed out on this one, so naturally they went for GMEs little retard brother BB
Volatile would be the right word. Shorting come Tuesday would be restrictive due to the uptick rule, which would indirectly affect options (similar to Dec 30). I’d imagine the price of puts would be cheaper on Wednesday. If you check my comment history I’m a GME bull, my views may be bias. But I can only imagine that this stock will swing both ways until there’s a firm press release from GME stating their strategy moving forward. Large institutions are still betting heavy against it based on the existing/former strategy. Once they realize GME won’t go bankrupt they’ll exit their positions (most likely not all at once).
Please update if you do end buy buying top of the call charts for 1/22

FUD ALERT
Mods are a asleep
Actual deaths are 13 not 23
"Twenty-three people died in Norway within days of receiving their first dose of the Pfizer Covid-19 vaccine with 13 of those deaths apparently related to the side effects of the shots, 

from CTV news
"Norwegian  officials have adjusted their advice on who gets the COVID-19 vaccine in light of a small number of deaths among very frail older people, leaving it up to each doctor to consider who should be vaccinated."
 This news is neither shocking or unusual considering the advanced age of the deceased..
The truth slowly sets in

You think it’ll go down Tuesday though? It went down to $34 and I still held. Maybe I should sell right at open on Tuesday and put in $2k at the dip

Disney doesn’t own fox sports or Fox News.
I'm not disagreeing to anything you are saying.

The 1%ers have billions at their disposal, which they can deploy a fuckton of ways to influence govt and thus rules.

What tf do you have, fellow autist?  You don't have any power to make SEC put any 1%er in jail, nor you have the power to re-instate this forum if it gets shut down.  

So once again, don't let your 99% mentality (however justified it is) ruin it for the rest of us.
good luck

Honestly I'm not even here for the squeeze, was very undervalued and very profitable so far. I am also sticking around post squeeze if it is squoze because we're currently sitting at fair value in my opinion and its now a growth play with RC. The squeeze is just a juicy cherry on top.

Yes
Shorts are by definition on margin, but most are institutional and have active risk management so their decision to cover would primarily be because they think it’s a loser of a position not because they are forced. Except on a day like Wednesday.
Sounds like something Jeffrey dahmer would do tbh
$30,000 in and $1.15 dividends per month? That’s good money! I’m at 50¢ dividends myself each month, and trying to raise that.
Lol and just because there’s a lot of short interest on a stock doesn’t mean it’s going to squeeze either

Best of luck moving forward! With as many shares as you have, it would be something each week at least. Just a super long road to getting back to even, but doable over some time. I’m in the same situation with PLUG right now. Bought at 70 and it’s sitting at 60. Only way I can make this back is collect premiums along the way until some good news hits.

Looks pretty 🌈
Essentially if he’s doing this right, he is hoping that BB goes up, but not too much. Ideally for him it would go up to just under 15. In that case he keeps all the premium and the shares are now worth more. If however BB goes above 15, he will miss out on more gains. Finally, if it tanks, he will be assigned more shares and the ones he already has will be worth less.
That’s 1/1000000 though. And you have to be especially retarded to do something like that.

Not sure, my put purchase target was $832 and it hit $880 the day it hit my buy range. Check my comment history and you’ll see my comments on TSLA $800, then switched to puts. Last time I shorted Tesla was August 30th. $632 or the day it touches that I’ll sell my puts, and flip some profits for a dated long call.

The Stock keeps shooting up with the stimulus checks because you can get your stimulus check deposited in cashapp if you don’t have a bank account. So with Biden coming around with more stimulus checks I just see more gains
Most of them are using a lot of money when investing, so yes it makes a lot of sense to buy dividend stocks in that case
This was one of the pieces I didn't understand until recently. You summarized it very well. Those expensive call contracts will be attractive to anyone looking to purchase shares. Shorts would snap them up to avoid the short squeeze market price.
Read your post and everything so far makes sense.  There's only one thing that I might respond to.

You said GME will go down definitely in the next week due to the pattern of VW, before the meteoric rise.  VWs case is because there wasn't any activity before the meteor rise and it was sudden.  So sellers of the stock want to sell without buyers, then it was ignited by an announcement of Porsche.

GME's case is different.  You got retards here pumping the fucking stock on the daily, and buying it at obscene prices, no matter what.  

What do you think the catalysts are for a major drop in price before the meteoric rise?
You need to look at how many people are in the world vs how many have died vs their age and any pre existing conditions they had.
Shits gonna be worth a 100 mil in a few years.
How do you feel?
Bought 118 @ 8.88 on Thurs. Got scared of train leaving station on Friday morning. Don’t usually buy near open, but picked up another 152 at market price, bringing my average up to 270 @ 9.67. 

Seems like BB might be a good turnaround play, like GME. Also similar market cap to GME. Think this sub could do really well discussing and doubling down on plays like this.

Ya, still could work for tight b/a spreads like SPY. Either it goes your way or you're out. I'm thinking of trying this and soon as it turns profit set a stop loss to break even or small profit and then do a mental trailing stop loss as it runs up. Gotta work on cutting my losses earlier.
If you believe it will go higher than yes, i believe it will.

It’s not easy holding this one for someone who is new because you could be up 10% or down 20% so you have a high chance of selling. Especially if this is all your money. High risk high reward, scared money doesn’t make money.
No maybe 65

Thank you for the nice comment. Always nice to share information to someone eager to make it. I saw no one replied to you so I wanted to fill in the gaps for you. Thank you , hope to see you around as well. Good luck.
I didn't address 3) because i thought it was obvious but don't let it expire , especially in your example , expiration means you will lose all your money and forfeit all profit , always sell . Theta also affects the price of your option the closer it gets to expiration and lowers the value. Theta affects OTM (strikes nowhere near close to the price of the stock) more than it does for ITM (in the money) options that have exceeded your strike.
So I just got approved for level 2 investing. If I buy calls on GME, what do I do after that?

I do want to ask when you refer to the options section, are you referring to weeklies or those that are due months out or just options in general. Thanks!

Ok that's a good point, opp. cost compared to growth is always how I've thought about it but never considered that you could compound up but you could do that faster with high growth.

Back to buying FDs.
If your account limits you to three day trades it’s a margin account, not a cash account. That’s my point. That rule doesn’t apply to cash accounts. 

You have to wait for settlement in cash accounts, not margin accounts.

FUCK IT BOYS IM BUYING. SEE YOU AT $300

THIS IS BIG GME TO THE MOON  🚀🚀🚀
You are missing the fundamentals in your fundamental analysis. Value is relative solely to what someone is willing to buy it for. When you get margin called, that willingness is removed and is replaced by force. Shorts exceed float by a huge amount. Shorts will be forced to pay whatever sellers demand. 

And I ain't fukn selling 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I would reduce your expectations about squeezing to 100k win in a month though. Fucking awesome if it does, but it would need to meme like GME and I don’t think that’s happening. Lots of stocks carry a high short position for a long time. I might be retarded, but I don’t think a fund is allowed to purposely trigger squeezes either. It would need to be retail, and it’s already too expensive for most people (plus no cult-like worshiping of board members as far as I know lol).

I’m guessing the price is being suppressed by shorts, reaches a bottom, shorts cover over days with a chunk of profit, price rises cause it’s a low volume stock, repeat. But again I’m retarded and don’t know what I’m talking about. The price action over the last 6-7 months is crazy looking compared to other stocks, and I have no idea how long it will continue to cycle. But unless the shorts’ thesis fundamentally changes (eg they thought company was going to die, but an ER or two makes it clear they are growing) or WSB and RHers meme hard, it’s probably not squeezing.

My point is, if the stock is $105 on 2/12 or something, don’t 💎 🤚 hoping for it to pull a GME and make you 100k overnight. Be sure to book some profits at least, and maybe buy a March put in case it sells back down 10-20%. DFV’s GME calls were 1+ years out because no one knew when a squeeze might happen, and GME was already over 80-100+% shorted for months before he bought them. It’s possible that FIZZ may never actually squeeeeeeze.
Hasn’t changed my politics at all.
I am wondering why the market was down like 2 minutes after market opened on Friday? I thought the MM would dump the shares that they hedges against the calls they wrote after 330pm?

Wallstreetbets is more of a go big or go home subreddit.  R stockmarket is more traditional investments. 
Gme got new ceo thats had success in ecommerce and an investment company bet on it doing badly and is being forced to buy shares to cover their bad bet. Both happening simultaneously probably lead to the bump. Saying anything other than it is going to keep rising on wallstreetbets is heresy.

Thankfully GME is small cap with small float
Jealous clown lmao
Less of these
with a SI over 100% of float, would the margin change not be bullish in this case? Aren't most shorts on margin?

Also, with getting rid of margin- say I bought or shorted @ 15 and price is now 35, do I have to make up the 15 or make up the 35?

Just trying to understand
One might say at least they have a yard
Well it was already your money in the first place, it’s basically the same as selling a % of your shares and buying it back. When you receive the dividends, the stock price goes down accordingly and you’re paying taxes on it in a taxable account.

and you’re a smart one for not acknowledging the fact that retail gaming industry like GME is a maturing one? 

you know nothing about valuations so stop pretending like you do. so what costco is undervalued cuz their market cap is less than their yearly 1x revenue multiples? walmart too?


you compare revenue multiples of GME to early stage tech companies that are fully blown out if proportions. these early stage companies like FROG and SNOW dont even have a fully defined market segment. hence why bubbles can form and may look like they’re overvalued early on. GME’s future was bleak and still continue to remain bleak. sure their revenue multiples are significantly less than others but look at walmart, look at costco and see how their valuation fair with your dumb valuing methods.

you also talk like ryan cohen will change everything. GME will remain in the landscape it’s in. GME has made adjustments, but they’re still headed towards whats soon to be a block buster. 

i dare you to come back once people realize the shorts are covered instead whining here of unrealistic hypotheticals and glorify a dying company. have shame, donkey.

To be fair, in what industry isn’t there competition?

This is an extremely sticky space in terms of clientele. Once a contract has been landed, what incentives do governments and enterprises have to replace or build the solutions Palantir is offering themselves? I have a hard time believing the budget would be allocated.

Given that Palantir is ahead of the game in their product offering, having inroads into governments and enterprise customers could open up more sales opportunities down the line.

So then it comes down to what you believe the market opportunity is
Capitulation depends on the firm's portfolio balance and it's margin allowance.  You're intentionally misleading the masses by saying shorts expire by inferring an opinion of 'capitulation'.  Melvin can hold this shit through end of year if they inject more money into their portfolio, plain and simple.  There is no 'known' capitulation time frame ... It's all 'feeling'.  You should state it as such.
Well I'm a new so my plan is to put in 2k. Sell enough to cover my initial investment and let the extra go as high as I'm comfortable.

He himself would tell you this company is still grossly undervalued at just $2.5B. I know this...because he’s been saying it for a year already.

He was saying it even before Cohen came into the picture, which makes it an even more valuable play. This still has crazy room to run whether it squeezes or not, but it likely will and the market cap will find its water at a much higher point than it currently is.

It actually could have been a short attack. We'll see what the short info says when updated next week (I think 1/15 data is published Wednesday). Several sources have claimed it went up during this week's rise, but I don't have paid subscriptions to anything that has real time short info. 

It does make sense that shorts would try to stall the momentum with short sales, but it's an expensive tactic that can't last forever.

Flip side, at one point I was at -$33,000 on Friday. What goes up, also comes down.
The issuing option was put on the table by the previous board. Cohen likely won’t agree to it now. Even if, the amount won’t make a dent in shares shorted
Seems like you would need a solid initial investment to make it worth it, but I dunno.  I like growth stocks and don't care about dividends, perhaps I might be gay.
I’m fairly certain people just downvote things immediately that don’t involve their positions. People are selfish. This kind of well thought out post will get downvoted a bunch but the 3,000th “GME🚀🚀🚀to the 🌕🌕” post that provides no value will get a ton of upvotes.

Interesting, so when you say short interest, do you mean people buying puts or a decrease in the puts people already have by covering them during the squeeze?
Yeah I’m not purchasing any oil futures or anything like that. More so I think IF oil prices do go up, finding which individual company will increase the most is difficult. That’s why I’m thinking XOP because if all oil companies go up, this will as well.

But what you are saying definitely has more room to grow, the hard part is finding which has the most room.
Do you know where I could find more information agreeing with what you're saying?

Understood, but this thing went down from $43 to $34 after climbing from $20 earlier in the week. Long term may pose more risk as I do believe new management will turn the ship around. If I were to bet against, which I am not, it would be prior to the next er.

How many people have gone to jail for insider trading over the last half century while big corporate gets routinely bailed out by the taxpayer every time the economy shits itself? Martha fucking Stewart?

Until we start seeing the SEC put real criminals in prison and enforcing these rules then no, you don’t get to preach to me. Kindly eat a dick, retard.

I think you shouldn’t have such a negative view on R&D spend. It’s quite fundamental to the company’s growth.

Okay but if you YOLO’d into almost any meme stock on WSB this year you would be up bigly. If you’re sitting on the sideline or losing a bunch of your gains by hedging who is the stupid one in reality? Obviously the day of reckoning will come for those who continue YOLO everything, but if you took advantage of a face-ripping bull market and made out are you really stupid?

Can you give me an example of a company that has innovated and dominated so many different industries. Energy, insurance, taxi, software (FSD), hardware (the cars), green energy (solar), rockets, tunneling, biomedical interfacing. 

The fact that people think this is remotely possible is why it’s likely a bubble and people think it’s a cult.

Over the last six months, MT increased from $11.65 to $25.76. 

Regardless, that is not how you should view trades. The fact that MT is lagging is an indicator that you have a good entry position. It means it's undervalued compared to its competitors. It makes far less sense to play options on a stock that has rallied higher, despite having worse profitability.

What are your expectations on an actual game plan for the stock? I find it to be a worthwhile bet that upside is so high with no squeeze, and downside is protected relative to the upside. I could see it easily testing back to 20 before year end if the turnaround plan isn't discussed in public in more detail and sales stay flat. 

But the upside is really tantalizing. Curious your thoughts on what the business will do that's new.
this is the way my dude. also selling CCPs to take advantage of the insane IV

Banks would no longer benefit from fed settlement laws (allowing them to hold deposits uncredited for a couple days), so retail banks would take a hit too. Payment apps like Venmo and PayPal could take a swipe, especially if the Fed voluntarily serves as the facility for instant settlement. I don’t know what the move is yet, but I’m following it closely too.
SEC gets a lot of flack for alloying Chinese companies on US exchanges as it is basically just sucking out investors capital through fraud in most cases.
Performance of last 3 months

MT : 67.67%

X : 158.64%

CLF : 144.61%

So, yes MT stock has performed less good than X and CLF these past 3 months.

But no, MT isn't declining. The stock is way less volatile than other US stocks. Less volatility is not necessarily a bad thing.

Performance of last week :

MT : -2.74%

X : -6.2%

CLF : -8.44%

And the growth perspective for MT is strong, so no it's not money wasted.

All in all, the trend should impact all steel stocks and all of them should be winners.

I trust the DDs that have been done about MT being more global and vertically integrated. I'm in with 100 EU stocks and some EU warrant calls.

As long as the fed continues to destroy the dollar I will be bullish. The day they stop we will have larger problems than a stock market crash. Perhaps my gains can afford a loaf of bread in the future. This comes from a recovering perma bear.
Hello and thank you
The fact that you asked if it’s a $10 company rather than a $4.XB is concerning.

Anyways, yes I think this is a sub $6B company.

The balance sheet isn’t really that impressive. Gross margin seems healthy though.

Maybe a buy and hold that r/investing would be interested in. Still, not WSB worthy

Other than full on gambling and getting lucky, best way could be leaps on some cheap stock, like after a major dip. wait for next big correction/crash, find stock that dipped heavily but is likely to do well in the future and buy 2022/23 expiry options.

If not willing to wait long. get good at day-trading fd's

This thing took off on Wednesday due exclusively to retail buyers anticipating a squeeze. Some profits were taken. The shorts shorted more, triggering a 201. All 1.8 million autists are DDing right for the next 3 days an realizing that the possibility that this is a $100/share stock EOY even without a squeeze. 

I speculate an open price of at least  $40 on Tuesday due to MSM, FOMOs and YOLOs. The squeeze will start. No shorting, margins withdrawn. Some of the shorts will start to be forced to close. Even the full on tards ain't taking profits while the stock price is rising $1/minute. As the week goes on, the new puts from last week will start to expire and those positions will be forced to close. With selling volume dried up, it will take days for the shorts to cover their borrowed shares, some of which have been borrowed more than once. All the while the price ticks up, and up, and up, day after day.
 Well buying calls is just the other side of someone selling covered calls. Unless they are doing it naked, they already have the shares.

I guess it depends on what the ratio of shareholders to call holders is. I’m betting we’re predominantly shareholders based on the hundreds of posts the last few days and every DD since last year heavily pushing shareholding but I wouldn’t know.

You know how it goes, most of the them will disappear soon as we get a decent sized pullback.  Happened in June and happened in September.  Happened in late November with PLTR.  Just a matter of time.
A year ago to the day I had less than 6k in that account. ( I went on to add a little over 70k over the following two months which was most of my life savings) but starting slow and learning is important. It’s been a crazy ride.
Fair point! Nothing stops them (as far as I know) from dramatically increasing that number that I know of. (Other than paperwork for the Directors.)

It’ll be interesting to see how it unfolds. I don’t know if it is a likely scenario, with 1% odds, 10% odds, etc. : but I do believe it exists as a risk to a full blown, Volkswagen style, squeeze.

This is all after having a 6-12 month emergency fund and building a “DCA fund” to buy every dip.
oh no, I know they are miserable right now, borrowing demand is just not there, and people that do want to borrow won't qualify because of how uncertain the economy is. They're not doing great, but they are surviving and they won't fail like last time. The culture has changed I think, they are much more conservative right now, which is good for them, but not so good for the economy when we need money to get to people and they won't lend a dime. Things never actually returned to pre-2008, which is both good and bad, depends how you look at it.

Lol, I haven't laughed out loud in a while this autist thinks a short is buying put options. Either he's kidding or he's serious. Can't tell on this sub just the thought of it is funny.
Up 120% in 2 days, then down 10% on an overall red market day?? Yes I do believe it was a consolidation 🚀🚀🚀🚀

What is your thought process on that
It just sounds like you're overconfident about your ability to detect that someone is lying. There are 1.9 million subbed to WSB, there are bound to be people who just sound sus, maybe there are people being paid as well but I think your overconfidence is cringe.
I bought +10 calls for Jan 15 $11.50 . Massacred me for -$960. Rolled it over this week for $489 debit. Hoping I can recover some back.

Stop posting this garbage and go somewhere else
That’s correct, once the short sale circuit triggered, short still can manipulate the market by holding down the ask only.

I personally have a big position on TLT (20% of my net worth) + another 15% sitting in cash. This should give me liquidity in case of a drawdown. Given this fact it would be stupid of me not to put the remainder of my position to work milking the market (which it is right now, with appropriate stop losses in place). Long term I agree with you.

Yeah, I pretty much said as much in my post. I'm not looking for upvotes, I'm looking for a discussion. The timing is fucky, the newfag astroturfers are fucky, the fact that Jim fucking Cramer explained the Short Squeeze on prime time and the WSB play on GME the night before -- fuck man, we were *primed* to take off. Even his shitty twitter mention sparked the initial jump to $35. Boomers should have been all over this shit. But right when boomers should have shown up to get the DD on GME, the narrative was shifted to another up-and-coming stock.

I'm not saying BB is bad, but holy fuck was it [pushed hard by brand new accounts.](https://i.redd.it/c4xt65xwdjb61.png)

Guarantees..... oh you a cutie pie.
r/agedlikemilk
True. I got out of Occidental after buying in at around $10.50 a share. Sold it in December after holding it for exactly one month and 6 days (if my memory is still worth a damn, lol) Sold it for $21.50 I think (maybe it was $20.50, shit I'll have to go look back at the RH balance sheet) and that's only because I wanted an "early christmas gift." I sold both G.E. (which I had held for 6 months) and Occidental at that time.   


ANYWAY, the point of the story is Occidental started dropping almost immediately after I sold it. Still worth more now, but it took awhile. My thought process was with Biden in office, gas and oil stocks would need to prove processes transferring to clean energy or just get out of oil entirely. That being said, people will STILL be driving "gas guzzlers" for at least 2 or 3 years for my tastes...  


Still watching and waiting to see if oil stocks start tanking once Biden is "fully vested" into office. Some friends of mine say this is just the beginning for oil, especially since the Saudis are now moving product again. One guy thinks Oil is back up over $70 a barrel within a few months...  


Then there's our "second wave" of Covid... I'd be stupid to tell you that I KNEW what the next 6 months is looking like...

 Do you live in Canada? Just download 365 app right now and see if you think SCR is going to be providing anything revolutionary compared to what’s already mature in the market. Canada is more liberal than California. Imagine the license fees and handle tax that will be included in regulation material. A non-diversified business like SCR isn’t really primed to take advantage of this situation that will include heavy initial capital investment and long road to profitability.

That’s exactly right. When are those vs the gradual option decay though? Devoted long term bag holders aren’t at risk on that but call option holders are.

The offering would be valued at $100 million. They have stated this, if it did occur that would add roughly 2.8 million shares at current share price. A pittance compared to the amount of short shares remaining.

Don’t forget the whole world was bearish on GME until literally a few days ago and most still are so. Outside of WSB sentiment and hype doesn’t build as fast. Regular ppl and institutions are gonna be watching for more concrete events/catalysts to really start investing or to decide if they’re doubling down. Also catalysts don’t necessarily become less effective as time goes by because shareholders aren’t the ones on borrowed time.

Got a great play. Tupperware Calls. Has been steadily climbing ever since it's 52 week low. Recent article said the company was 48% undervalued. Dipped hard just like everything else did on that blood red Friday. Resistance seems to be 30 but I don't believe it will go that low. I see a recovery back to 35-37 and then breaking all time highs. Depends on how the market it obviously but if we see green this is an easy bag.

As I await for the casino to open, seeing some of ya'lls gains, just wanted to tell ya'll: fuck you, and congrats! 

A couple months ago, my bro asked me, "Have you heard of r/wallstreetbets? YOU belong there." Since then, this has been my source of: entertainment, FOMO, motivation, and smoothed out my brain for optimal "investments". With that said, I think my bro thinks I'm an autist-- not sure since this is unconfirmed. 

I got into options this week with my FOMO ATH, and looking at my graph, I detect a pony pattern: bullish AF. Ready for this casino to open!!! 🚀🚀🚀 Good luck y'all, and may the tendies always be with you 💎🙌[TA Pattern](http://imgur.com/a/4WCkqMy)

Thoughts on canoo?
That's a very complicated question. Too many assumptions would be needed to answer it either way. I'll just say it this way:

1) Anyone holding a short always has interest in shorting more to drop the price.

2) The rule does not **prevent** shorting. It prevents **shorting at a price below market price**. So I wouldn't say that it leads to pent up short demand directly, it's just there to prevent excessive market manipulation by shorters.

Sure, any "bad" news is good for shorts. And if they can hold out that long, that would be ideal. If you can call losing millions ideal.  

But they are already getting margin cut off at multiple brokerages. I will not at all be surprised to see other brokers follow suit. If they can't borrow money to wait, they can't wait.
They are kind of different. Tesla was going into a zero competitors growth sector. This is fighting for share and cost effectiveness, fixing a broken value company.
which?
Maybe because the fucking market is closed?

First off, this isn't just an "age", it's how things will be from here on out. Secondly that's just flat out wrong. No one has EVER tried to keep regular people "out" of the markets. They want as many Joe Schmoes to put as much money as they possibly can into the markets wtf are you even talking about?

If you’re going calls be smart and go with Leaps. Don’t buy dumb like many of us (I include myself with that statement) and get 1/29 calls and only a few leaps. BB is a long play. Nothing under 6 months and be ITM with a low break even % while the price is still in the $9’s. If you can’t do that help us all and buy shares. Need to drive that price to the moon. Buying straight calls won’t do that. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕

Here here young one, either A) market opens at a loss due to the massive force of shorts squeezing the nuts off GME so you buy that dip📉 or B) market opens high 🚀🚀🚀and you ride that rocket to mars

Legit if you put a limit buy @$35.50(the price we're at over the weekend) what may happen is your order may not be excecuted due to markets opening higher than that price, basically jumping higher than your limit immediately.

This guy does not fuck
\-They could but they have to pay fees. So they can just return them at a price, triggering the squeeze, or they could keep delaying the return and pay fees indefinitely.

\-I don't think that's the case. Is this really the craziest stock in the last 12 months? We've seen TSLA be absurd and afaik they never took the margin out for it.

\-I really do think it's impossible to go back below 20$. There are 3 guys in the board whose mission is to turn this sinking ship around. They must have a plan if RC is so committed to it (12.9% of shares). Even without RC, they overestimated how bad things looked for GameStop. How's a company that makes $7b in revenue going to have a MC below $1b. It cannot be. The shorts started their shorting and got the SP to around $4, now we are at $30+. You really don't think their thesis is dead now? The main point is that digital is the future for games, and I agree, but that future is not now as data shows AND there's the MS deal for digital revenue. Their thesis is dead for me.

I do agree with the statement about ripping the band-aid, maybe we don't have a VW squeeze, but we see this thing raise steadily for years. But if it's the latter, who's gonna sell their shares if we can just keep checking the short % and keep holding and holding until we get the SP we want? You'd have to be dumb to sell with a short % above 10%, the only thing everyone has to do is just wait for the price they want, knowing that shorts are exiting. So in the end that triggers a short and violent squeeze either way.

The 25th UBS Evidence Lab DIY survey of 2k+ adults (> Access Dataset) paints a bullish near-term picture for Home Improvement demand. Specifically, 67% of respondents expect to do a home improvement project within the next 3 months, the highest read in the 6 year quarterly history of the survey (vs. 61% in Dec’19 & 59% in Dec’18). Further, the average expected spend was up 31% to $7,200. Buy LOWE's calls. March 200$ Calls. As inflation keeps rising with government spending, the dollar begins to lose its value and though future earnings look worse in retrospect, unless there is updated guidance. Value and cyclical stocks are more stable and therefore you can estimate how much their earnings are. This survey from UBS suggests that home improvement is still in a bull market and funds are flowing into Lowe's and HD. I suggest Lowe's because it's a smaller market cap with more opportunity for growth. HD can only lose market share, gain a bit only.

What makes it different is that it's going to be an online app. Accessible through your phone anywhere, and anytime. The attractive thing about those 'illegal sports bet' is that they can just make it happen with few clicks in a bar, laughing and shitting with other no lifes at the bar. Young people these days don't even have access to a car in Canada, thanks to shitty insurance rates. They won't just walk into a gas station to bet on a sports team, nah, not how it works. By making it legal, you attract people who were scared to break a law, and tons of traction gains.

Do you have a better frame of reference for folks who have no idea what’s going on? It’s a race against margin costs that will probably capitulate in the next 2 weeks but we have people expecting a moon on Tuesday or Wednesday. There’s a good chance that doesn’t happen and people need to understand that and hold through.
It’s been kind of shit around here since Citron’s NIO tweet. Seems like that took a lot of wind out of peoples sails when we realized some Twitter tard has the ability to stop every run up we are riding. He just has to come here, read for 15 min, buy puts, and then write a tweet. Rinse and repeat.

Nope, I had 1/15 options that paid out nice. The entire market is not a ponzi scheme because it’s no relying on a short squeeze is it. Some names are like this. You think AAPL is relying on a squeeze?
So, you’ll take profit when you see fit? Ok. If it’s at the top when short ratio is down to say...1 or 2...who will buy it from you? Would you buy it off someone else? Knowing full well you’ve cleared the shorts you’ll buy at top thinking GME will somehow be a growth story?
Collectively you can’t all make out. Some of you will sell and some will be left bag holding. It’s simple math and logic.

I’ve been involved with BB technology for 15 years now and rode through their mobile demise.

If you look for analysts comments over the past years you’ll see a trend.  Undervalued.  Lots of cash on hand.  Huge IP buried in their basement.  Government contracts. Industrial/nuclear supply chain.

Then nearly every analyst talks about their phones.  BB exited the phone market like 5 years ago.  That’s an eternity in the phone industry.  The don’t mention that BB tech is already in nearly every other new car on the road, nor do they mention how they’ve been working on car automation for years now.

They also don’t mention how they have existing relationships and dedicated infrastructure with every cellular carrier in the world, left over from their mobile phones.  Would a dedicated network independent from the internet, certified for DoD use, that could connect to every car in the world with mobile service be useful for the next generation of smart cars?

BB is one of those tech stocks that I bought just to sit on and wait until i was retired, so I don’t have to wash my yacht myself.

I spat out my coffee having only heard the first flat note. God bless you.
For the first table I just combined the holdings of the entire board, so RC ventures has like 12.9% and Sherman has some, etc. The actual numbers for each board member is in the post I linked.

So if RC adds 7% he will go from 12.9% to 19.9% and the board as a whole will go from 19% to 26%

Hope that makes sense
Even with the big dip down it was up 5 percent for the day.  I love the pep talk and this company is making an interesting pivot.  Chen’s a turnaround guy and the company is positioned for future success.

Right. It’s not a bad stock but it’s being shilled as a squeeze rather than fundamentals. A lot of FOMO going on and a lot of money going to be lost. This is a good long play like the 2023 calls.
I bought a put for $35 on gme Friday when it was hovering around $37.50, I caught the rocket on the way down ig
Saw it with vw too. It dipped a lot at first but once shorts started covering it went up FAST.
I see why you think that but I have been looking into it more and I think BB will develop into a GME play. It is undervalued and forgotten, but it will rise. The timing is sus but they thing is that it was a lot in response to selling patents to china, partnering with Sony, and Facebook settling all in the last three days that helped. Of course, GME is more important, I find being able to get a used xbox is more likely to happen then ever shopping for a blackberry. But, they are still heavily used for security purposes by the government.
Well duh, doesn't not make it fun.
Yeah Idk if the sec gives a shit about a bunch of teens giving each other bad advice. Pretty sure OP is just grumpy cause some other teen messed up their secret weapon stock tip.
Margin requirements are really a measure of a broker's assessment of volatility. The higher the margin requirement, the higher the broker thinks the volatility is. It does indeed affect people trying to buy shares on margin, it also affects people that already own shares. Two-edged sword.

But increased volatility means those brokers **don't think they know where it's going**. Brokers that **don't know where something is going** are not in the same boat as the short sellers (**who think it's going down**). Therefore, IMHO, those brokers are less likely to let the shorts stand forever without calling them in because they agree with the prediction those shorts are based on and are willing to let em just ride it out and pay the fees.

On that basis would it be a fair assumption that there’s a lot more short interest out there than was able to be exercised on Friday? If anything the short restriction being in effect all day Friday would suggest a lot of pent up short demand that will be released as soon as the rule is lifted, no?

r/dividends the type of people where the upvote triangle is pointing down
I would assume factset is fairly accurate in their estimates.  Don’t know how would they stay in business if they keep displaying false numbers. Will know official value when FINRA is released. In the meantime 🚀🚀🚀🚀
GME will buy out TSLA by the end of the year.
Robinhood will exercise it automatically, or sell it an hour before close if you don’t have the cash. I don’t know what happens if you don’t have the money and they can’t find a buyer.  

I know that for puts Robinhood will expire them if they can’t find a buyer and you don’t have the shares, instead of putting you in a short position like most brokers.

I hope so. I jumped in on the GME train after hours yesterday. 100 @ $35.98

I paper handed this back in November when I had 50 @ $18.53 and sold for 12.93 2 weeks later. Buy high sell low.

>PLTR uses a lot of data anayalst who does the gritty nitty work of extracting the data

Welcome to ANY data platform.

There is no such thing as "AI" that works out of the box.  You will always need data scientists for this sort of thing.

There is likely economy of scale here tho, the more data sets the more common functions you can build.  I.e. find a data source in one gov org that exists in another then you only build the model once, find that again in another 5 agencies and you simply redeploy the model, made adaptations to one, and it applies to them all.  It's all about the data.

Whether or not they're losing money on data scientists is a different discussion.  I find this hard to believe, maybe a loss leader for some clients, but as someone who sells data platforms, consulting, and integration, you just add margin to resource cost or blend it with software/services.

He can and eventually will, but the more you use that bullet the less effective it becomes, and you also open yourself up to the rebuttal and short sale reports if you get specific.

I said this when someone originally posted his GME thing awhile back. It’s just a finmeme/parody account but people here are quick to follow and slow to do their own DD.
You think it’s too late to go in now?
Yes that's the most useless degree I've ever heard of, more useless than an arts degree seriously.
Some guy last week said he was waiting for it to hit 20$ again, now resistance is at 34,  if you believe it’s going to 5x from here why would you wait to get in at 6% lower. 
6% isn’t going to save you anything, and if your belief is it’s going to go up then buying at any price lower than the expected price is the move.

Ok I appreciate the logic and the argument, and I’m not saying YOU don’t understand , but let me explain what I mean... if the stock rises to 10x what it is currently (I think this possible) it will do so for reasons that most people don’t yet grasp... my argument here is that even most Tesla enthusiasts and bulls are still largely unaware of the implications of what Tesla has been developing and planning and why.    Argue that the current price is mainly based on what is coming with dominating the automotive market.   They don’t foresee what I believe is coming which is not Tesla joining a holding company, but becoming a holding company of sorts with spacex, boring, starlink and energy, not to mention the gaming platform under development and neuralink (which I view as much more far fetched).    My argument here is that most bulls have baked in the game changing tech and EV and view it as bonus that it is loosely affiliated with other visionary companies.   I think Musk is capable of converting these vision of taking several companies to a different level and the most convenient way of doing so is under a Tesla banner.   And I don’t consider myself to be a bull.... more of a cyber bull

Thanks for the analysis. Agree that the super short squeeze is not very likely unless we can get institutional out, and that won't happen if there is now no proxy vote.
Worst case GME drops to $5 a share?
Can the casino open up already smh
If 30% of float would have been bought back, we'd be around 70 by now. That would have been 60% extra demand (30 less short and 30 more long)

Anyone know what short interest there was during the vw squeeze? Seems unlikely that it was near 100%.

Also my company just switched to Salesforce and they're loving it.  I've also seen some major negative reviews but I think salesforce sales team(heh) are pushing their product to a lot of small and mid-sized businesses that are realizing they need a product like salesforce to keep afloat in this new post-covid market.  Salesforce is about to make a fuckton of money, even if its not the best product.

I have come a across of pltr as part of my day job. What they sell is a bitemporal data built on a sql database. That is what pltr sells and honestly that is not a difficult problem to solve. They managed to win  govt contracts because of Peter theil's connections with trump. They literally given up on their product for financial institutions because the clients figured out that pltr adds no value. Best of luck pumping a low margin IT consultancy business.

Why the fuck is everyone saying that shorts expire? Short positions do not expire like options. Either the lent shares get recalled by the owner, the position becomes too expensive to maintain and the shorter closes the position or the broker closes the position.

Shorts do NOT expire.

If I was a huge investment firm? I'd short volatile stocks to 0 all day long if it was possible and legal. And that's exactly what naked short selling tries to do, short sell before a buy actually goes through so you can short and return and re-short and return and re-short as far as you want.

If you want to trade by this post’s thesis, then you should be buying shares throughout.
Am I wrong or are a lot of people misinterpreting the effect of the margin requirements. Doesn't this affect people trying to buy shares on margin? Which limits retail investors ability to push the price up. Is that not accurate?

I’m dropping 2k more next week. My plan is 500 at open and see how Tuesday goes. If we get a dip I may throw the rest in then. If it seems like the squeeze has started I’ll throw it all in then
I can’t find any of those tickers on RH. Can somebody help?

Cant get the tendies if you dont try
Never go full retard
Could the shorter have rolled over their shorts to the new price range which they think they can control? And we're using the total short interest as an indicator that they didn't cover at all whereas in reality they just moved their covers forward taking a lot that caused the mini squeeze on wednesday?

The net financial difference is the time value of the option. That is, the option is worth more than the shares if there's still time left until the option expires. Therefore, only in rare situations should you exercise rather than sell the option if there's time left on it.

Yes except that only 27 million covered their short (if what I said above is true) so the other 43 million are heavily underwater and if they cover then it’ll be the spike to make the new shorts cover.

Ok I dont want to open up wounds or derail the thread. But I dont Understand US things either. Im European. Democratic Socialists. Wages are negotiated via unions and business owners.

Tips like you said is the equivalent of me gifting someone money so I dont even think of it as a wage. The wage is something else. But yeah.

Texas size 10-4 super chief.  You have people saying they are going to hold this ticker because it has long term investment potential because some guy who was CEO of an online pet supply retailer who is speculated, not even confirmed, to be coming aboard to be Gamestop's messiah.  It's insane in my opinion that everyone thinks this one guy can save a business that made its money off a corner of the market that has all but evaporated.  For every one person who actually says they want to hold it, there are 9 other autists on here trying to make their 10-bagger so they can post gains porn for karma.

Nothing that is hyped by this sub should be considered sound long term investment strategy, especially when it relies on thousands of fuckin WSBtards working together towards a common goal.  There will be winners and there will be losers.  You can't guarantee that you will be a winner but you can guarantee that you will not be a loser if you just sit it out.

This is all my opinion.  I have done no DD and am not a market expert.  I'm happy to be proven wrong and I hope everyone gets rich.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X2WH8mHJnhM) in all it's glory.
Thanks this is super helpful, I’ve only done a few small options trades and have mostly just done shares with the stocks that are popular here. Regarding exercising the option, I’ve tried looking this up and it’s all conflicting information; in your scenario, would I need the $5000 in cash (since I currently don’t have margin on my account) in order to exercise? Or would my broker (Etrade btw) see the ITM option and automatically exercise and sell the shares for me?? It seems like if it’s the first, I’ll be looking into doing leaps, but the second is pretty prohibitive.

You continue to dig yourself deeper and solidify you being a complete dumbass. “ the market is forward looking”. And you say there are no fundamentals. Start with the easiest one. Revenue. It’s still undervalued. You can say I’m a newbie all you want. I turned 70k into 2.8 million on over 400 trades over a  year time frame. Yes I’ve gotten lucky but I’ve also found value on my own and made all my own picks. I have had 5000% options trades at over 500k. You haven’t done shit. Too early to evaluate a price? That’s why you will continually be left in the dust. Short squeeze is the only thing going for them? They’ve executed already to turn the company around 100 ways. And you don’t mention Ryan Cohen once. You are a fucking joke.

Isn't it kind of back to square one then? If all of these shorts opened new positions at around 30 or 40, it's going to take another really big price increase to force another squeeze.
Grats on the IV gain. Im bullish af and i don’t know options well enough to yolo on it yet. I love wsb but many i assume here for the free tendies are way too blind coming to this.

There's been a lot of option activity all over the market and some interesting price action that's followed as a result (see XOM on Friday, ZH covered it well, I dunno if it's okay to link ZH here). Given this increase in option activity, there is bound to be a reckoning - someone will get burned either on the upside or downside due to a large move.
Ok
Truth. We’re in a rigged market now. Stonks only go up, is not a joke at this point
IBRK has as low as 25k shares available to short on Thursday. Friday morning up to 500k, Friday afternoon went up to 1M (with steadily decreasing %). I would assume that's because they saw a decrease in shorting as of Friday.

Hey, another Kripp Sleeper. I don't fall asleep to it as much as I used to but it is nice to have something going on in the background.
Wtf is a dividend?
Assuming that short interest is still close to as high as it was at the start of last week, it's still not close to the same situation. The VW squeeze was caused by Porsche drastically reducing the number of shares in the float. Short interest on VW was 12%, and Porsche's purchase was going to bump the float size down from 45% to 1%. In GME's case it would be like if the short interest was suddenly bumped to like 600%. The GME squeeze, if it hasn't happened yet, could be big, but it won't be the size of the VW squeeze.

In all honesty, I appreciate everyone’s concerns. What most people aren’t taking into consideration is that the car drove (yes, past tense...) safer than I. If I decide I deserve another one, I will be driving safer as I know know the feeling of traveling sideways down a freeway at 100MPH. Again, my fault, not FSD.

I would NEVER recommend someone attempting to replicate this picture and it wasn’t made for viral posting. It was late, I was hungry and on a very straight section of road. My #1 focus was on the car and it’s reactions and everything else (spilling food, picture quality...) were secondary. Still, I get it, not safe. I think the most damage that came from this post are the hoards of Tesla owning autist who might try the same, without taking the precautions I, believe it or not, did.

Like i said, i hold for long term, but paperhand retards here gotta calm the fuck down if they wanna stay in this one
Im no expert by any means, but I know if IV is high (still 250%) you're likely gonna have a bad time. 

I doubled my position on Friday with shares. I'm very confident it's going to hit at least 70 minimum. Lots of people are expecting it in the hundreds. There isnt a bad spot to jump in with shares, you just may have to wait longer. Just this retards opinion.
Just be careful that also means that if it stays in this price range for a while the calls will be most worthless

In this game your greatest risk actually one that isn't connected to the price: IV. 

I personally am done playing with this because after I predicted correctly that the IV would rise when the quarterly sales results were presented I was like, "Oh fuck, these guys are exuberant". 

I think at some point a lot of people are going to lose a lot of money even when the stock does what they needed it to do just because of the number of exits even if the price holds and the options are ITM both ways.

You’re kidding, right? A ~10% drop after a 120% gain after two days is totally expected. People are taking profits, new shorts are being sold, etc. look at any stock that has done similar things.

Show off.
100 shares of PLTR = $2500.

1 deep otm covered call 1 month out = $215 profit 

So $2500 investment will net you $215 a month. I'm pretty sure that's more that half of r/dividends makes combined.

There is a lot of pumping going on. I dont trust it.
You see me with 5 pebbles. You borrow my pebbles  You bet another guy from ur cave 5 pebbles that pebble demand is gonna go down. U were wrong. U give the 5 pebbles to ur cave mate. Now I want my pebbles back. U look around. Everyone likes there pebbles. They don't lend u any. U search for some on the ground. U find 2. How long till u can give me my 5 pebbles back? U can't. There aren't enough pebbles. 


Now put this on a much larger scale of numbers and pebble prices are gonna 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

r/dividends The type that can retire
r/dividends the type of people who buy 100 shares of Ford just to get a discount on a Fiesta.
I bought weekly calls as lottery tickets.  The IV is so high & we don’t know what will fully trigger a complete squeeze.  So the smart calls to buy are ones expiring past July.  


Shares are the risk safe move.  Even with no squeeze they should retain 70% of their current pride based on optimistic buying after the Cohen news (and that’s like a really bad scenario case)
/r/dividends the kinda people to randomly approach you in a restaurant and ask if you’re done with that and ask if they can eat it

We can't of course not really evaluate the connection to trump. Thats another factor why you can't accurately predict howfundamentally this company will do in this year.   
e their products, because they aren't available to public and nobody really knows how they work (at least i didn't find something) (which is also resulting in an outcry from rightwatch groups for months)   
agencies

Also, it looks like they profited hugely because of trump. Alex Karp is somehow connected to trump, even before his presidency even begun. I think it aint a coincidence that PLTR grows if the government pushes them.   


Before trump PLTR also lost contracts with NSA for example. They have a good or bad product but not everyone is satisfied and i find it hard to really evaluate their products, because they aren't available to public and nobody really knows how they work (at least i didn't find something) (which is also resulting in an outcry from civil-right-watch groups for months)   
agencies

Of course, Biden won't push PLTR away if it does work. But it does seem like a huge gamble to me. If the contracts don't get a renewal, then this company is in serious trouble.  


We can't of course not really evaluate the connection to trump. Thats another factor why you can't accurately predict how fundamentally this company will do in this year.   


We don't know how much trumps connection with Alex did something and how much force there was for the agencies to use PLTR instead of another competitor it could be that under Biden this pressure, if it was necessary isn't existing anymore and then you are will see all these contracts expiring and the company isn't yet profitable?  


**Don't get me wrong:** It seems like a nice stock, but a one with heavy gambling. Or i got something fundamentally wrong and can't read us-balance-sheets
Steadily climbed?! Are you serious? When news of the steel increases took effect, X moved from the 16s to the 23s, steel dynamics from 38 to 42 and what has MT done? 22.5 to 23.9? With it continuing to decline every day. 

Of ALL the steel stocks, MT is by far the worst.

$100 seems impossible to me this week without any news over the weekend. 

Breaking $60 seems challenging this week since many new investors see GME ath price at ~$64. 

I see this week as potentially having a run up to $50 max followed by a retrace to around $30 and consolidation around $35. 

This could look like the squeeze is “over” and shorts begin covering followed by news from GME which leads to 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
To follow your logic, the stock would have fallen further on Friday if the 10% rule weren’t invoked and shorting wasn’t restricted?

Yes.

Important to remember also that at any minute the company itself could drop a catalyst on us and the powder keg will be lit. We don’t know when that will be, we just know it’ll explode if/when it does.

The announcement of RC joining the board along with the other Chewy execs was an unexpected one and I presume the next announcement they drop on us will also be unexpected, so best to just buy, hold and wait for the explosion.
Where do you get that information on the expiration of their shorts? Just seen people post a lot of different information concerning shorts/puts expirations/margin calling.

If this is the short squeeze than I want the organic growth. Remember the fundamentals. This company is worth in the 50-100 per share range based on our cash on hand and free cash flow. I don’t think that’s the squeeze although many did cover but were replaced by new shorts that will squeeze as well. Fintel shows that on the 13-14th had a total of about 55 million shares traded short. Iborrowshares shows that there aren’t many shares available to short. So I’m assuming half of the short shares traded were shorts covering, and the other half are new shorts jumping in.

Kurt is not one of the directors on the way out and was not forced to sell his shares due to the RC agreement. Kurt is one of the board members that will be put up for reelection at the next annual meeting.

He also was not a direct beneficiary of these shares, his fund hestia capital sold them because gamestop's rising price had caused it's gamestop position to breach their single stock concentration limits. 

RC is not required to bump his stake to 19.9% he is capped at not going higher than 19.9%

And where we are at now. Both companies want their money from the credit back. And they are looking around right now trying to get more credit to cover it
Shorts expire e o m but the margin cost is super high so it’s a game of chicken. The first people to start covering will get out but set off a chain reaction. They are trying to bluff us by buying more and making us think the price is going down as a last ditch effort

You left out the part where they explained to the idiots bashing their small “returns” that they don’t get to invest working for CNBC. Imagine being so close to all those opportunities and never get to act on them.

WE aren’t doing anything. Investing is dog eat dog and you shouldn’t be asking for someone else to tell you what to do. That’s how you get absolutely fucked. Read all of their financial reports and news articles and come to your own conclusions about what to do. 

Otherwise, put your life savings into shares and pass them down to your grandchildren.
Look. If you’re long, then just sell other assets to cover.  This is the best bet in the market right now, even if it takes holding til June.  The shorts are going to bleed, and they will be paying incredible interest as long as we hold.
Not conviction, but loss aversion.  And they’ll do whatever they can (sometimes unethically) to make sure not to lose. It may take them a while but I think they’ll have to exit their positions because of the cost to hold the positions on their books.  They’ve been short for a long time, and that’s when the stock was trading at like $8 for months. Now that it’s over $30 they’re going to be forced to manipulate the stock back down (which they have to be trying). When they fail to do that they have to mark their losses and start unwinding their positions.  Melvin can’t be the only big shorter and when the dam bursts there will be a chain reaction of unwinding positions pushing the price up that continue until short interest drops to more normal levels. Get your popcorn.

Just trying to increase the level of discourse. We were there once. A lot of new traders. They will learn by doing, reading, thinking, and of course, pain.

Brokers will manage according to their estimates of what happens under stress. If people are extending into concentrated accounts of only GME with huge positions long on margin, you can bet the brokers will start ramping margin req. The fact IBKR hasn't means IBKR has fewer clients doing that so far. Which makes sense relative to Schwaab.

I don’t get paid till Friday, how fucked am I on yolo my paycheck
Very good point, and sometimes I myself forget that. It’s almost that little thought in the back of your mind that sees somebody make 400k off a few grand and then you think, “What if that happened to me?” But the reality of it happening is much more slim. A lot of times I’ve made 200% returns at open after buying calls, but I sit on them and don’t sell immediately. I feel as if patience and knowing when you reasonably sell is good as well. But there is always that evil thought of “What if it gets higher”

I know a lot of people talk shit about these long, actual DD posts, but I really appreciate it. Makes me feel better. I’ll admit that it’s a little over my head in some parts but I still have a lot to learn.

And so people don’t downvote a serious reply to a serious post, here’s some rockets 🚀🚀 🚀
You're not all going to sell at the top, that's not possible.

I am genuinely concerned about the number of people who interpret the word short to mean either: a small rise, or it's happening soon as in a short time from now.
Yes.
It's actually less risky than holding stock. While it runs the risk of total loss, you get 100 shares of leverage for a lower price. If the stock drops, you're still fucked either way. The only issue is liquidity (sometimes).

It works better with lower IV, but there's still a benefit.
Yes. How is it done elsewhere?

"You see this line right here ? This is major support from this level alllllll the way down here. But going up we have this line as resistance we bounced off it 2 times already but the next time we could crack it with the momentum we are seeing. Long term I am bullish but short term it is a risky asset to own." - every guy ever

It stands for fixed deposits. It's shorthand for 0 days-till-expiration options. Options are a derivative of stocks, so are more volatile. They also lose all their value when they expire. The commenter is basically joking by giving you advice to bet all of your money on a very risky position that depends on the stock going up or down considerably within a Friday afternoon.

Great question I used to work at McDonald’s when I was a pleebing back in the day. The minimum wage at the time was $9 and shortly after it was raised to $10. Everyone also got a dollar raise but the cost of certain items went up as well, presumably the big mac, fries etc. now the jump from $12 to $15 is a much larger pay increase but you also have to understand that the cost of living is also going up in certain areas and although it seems outrages the area in which they live in can technically afford it(NYC, San Francisco, Seattle), but I cant say this for every state, In that scenario most companies would have to readjust prices to meet the current demand for pay increases basically it would like nothing ever changed. The pay increase would be more to fight inflation if anything.

Q3 2020 never forget 😢
Squeeze might happen this coming week, in a few weeks time or with Q4. If i have to hold for months i will do it even if it plummets temporarily.
Big tech will come back in a big way as money rotates out of the easy stuff (has been EVs/Clean Energy, SPACs, space, etc.). I think funds have been probably been adding big tech (minus some necessary position trimming for risk management) in a tight range. This is why it's mostly been flat for 6 months (AMZN, MSFT). 

I bought calls that are probably too short-dated in hindsight. The play book will likely be price suppression over the next 3 weeks leading up to earnings, and then gains thereafter. This was kind of common 6 months ago when a few companies blew out earnings and saw no movement, but sure enough a week or so later they run.

Listen you retards this is something I've observed over and over again with AAPL. If you wanna make money, this is a surefire way to do it.

When there is news of an upcoming product announcement, corporate call, launch or earnings for Apple, buy 2-3 days before the event and sell it right before the announcement day at the close. I have not seen any other stock that predictably follows buy the rumor sell the news as AAPL.
There is always a run up before the event and sell off on or after the event day.

There's a super in depth DD of PLTR on Seeking Alpha titled "Palantir: Parallels With Microsoft, Potential Network Effects Underappreciated" that I would recommend if you're all in. I didn't paste the link because i think SA links are banned here. Has a price target of $47 by 2022.

I've been a screeching PLTR fanboy since a bit before the first public earnings report and I agree that this company is still undervalued in comparison to other SaaS and data management/analytics companies. However, I do think that the increasing politicization of PLTR should not be ignored given PLTR's dedication to serving the US and the current state of US politics. AOC has criticized PLTR for it's contracts with ICE and the unfortunate consequences of the insights PLTR provided to ICE agents. It's often discussed here that Obama and Joe like surveillance which PLTR allegedly assists with and can/does face criticism from representatives from both parties who are more privacy-focused. 

These things are more of a testament to how good their software is than anything, but it's clear now more than ever that other business (potential clients) have no problem disassociating themselves from highly politicized firms so that they don't end up in the spotlight as well. To be honest, I hope that PLTR makes Foundry a separate company that is still owned by PLTR (think Alphabet vs Google) so that their political work doesn't affect their commercial brand.

TLDR: PLTR 🚀🚀🚀🚀

In this context of a squeeze, the more shares taken out of circulation, the better.  Covered calls are very profitable right now due to the price of option.  Every covered call takes a hundred shares out of circulation.

As an attorney, i can say you are correct, publication of "insider information" means that it is no longer insider information. That includes publishing it on a forum/bullten board like WSB. That does not mean the person posting such information can be sued by their employer/contractor for violating a NDA, restrictive convenant, ect for making the insider information public.
Right now it's pretty low so I picked up some more shares
The obvious difference between the two is that DFV actually posted positions, consistently. He made his case and put his money, literally, where his mouth was.

I’ve seen several pump and dump schemes on this sub and BB checks the boxes.

Sudden, speculative interest in a stock with dozens of new accounts claiming rockets. 

It’s a dud for me without much differentiation or competitive advantage but go off.

Always diversify. The only stocks you should invest in are GME and PLTR like you mentioned but also BB. You will be on the moon in no time🚀🚀🚀
Pros you own shares so no expiration, cons would be you get rid of the leverage having calls provides aka you have control over 100 shares without paying for 100 shares

People don’t want to wait around to sell their old game and then have to ship it then wait for the money from eBay. People want cash. You can get all those things on Amazon but you can’t just doordash them from amazon. If you want a headset, controller, any other accessory you’d have to drive your lazy ass to the store or wait until next day at least to get it. GameStop started having doordash pick stuff up.

Just did some further digging for you. Domain registrar is in Nassau, goddamn offshore trail ends there again. However from the start the records show that the ownership of the domain itself is prohibited from being transferred. 

So we know the Antigua offshore company (IOEL) was a subsidiary of British company Sportingbet Plc. Sportingbet Plc was acquired by GVC Holdings Plc (now Entain). Entain is a FTSE 100 company. They are likely still the owners (or they at least have significant control of the Caymans LLP which owns said domain still). Offshore companies are notoriously hard to track by design but that's all I could get. Hope that helps. 

However IOEL cumulatively only had a 50% stake in the said LLP, with the other belonging to Starnet International Systems Inc. which doesn't exist on any internet directory. Even if you managed to get in contact with Entain, they would have to agree with Starnet to allow the LLP to sell the domain. Or since the domain is prohibited from being transferred they'll make you acquire the fucking Caymans LLP? No idea.

sorry if im toxic but it seems we have folks spreading FUD out here and I need to nip that shit immediately. Think about it this way.. they generated 1.7 billion net last quarter (that number will increase i assure you), the market cap is 2.3 billion after last week. that is like buying a house for 220k and being able to rent it for 170k every 3 months. if you look at that and say "holy shit i'd buy that house in a second!" well guess what, thats what you are getting with gme stock right now not to mention the shorts closing.

The volume was absolute insanity on Friday. I made some small tendies with a 1/22 10c But I let it bleed a lot of value like a true autist. I have 300 shares @ 10.20 so I took a small beating and it's possible the next couple weeks won't be kind but I'm comfortable holding the position for awhile and possibly buying more if it continues to dip.
I think the price could go up. Or it could go down. I'm confident it'll definitely do something

Clearly you have done well for yourself , but some of your claims are uncharacteristic of the high net worth people I happen to know. My friend is one of 3 managing partners at a pharma vc with 3bn under management. He never talks about his money like that. The only inkling I have to his net worth is simple math and understanding how vc works. And the 900k quarterly check to his ex I accidentally saw him write when visiting him in SF. Anyway - I appreciate your insights. Sorry didn't mean to be a prick.

So let's draw a parallel here.

Insider Trading is somewhat like Copyright Infringement in this case; for the people who are downloading the stuff from the torrent website, much like the people who are reading the information from the public forum, there is no real "crime" there. It's the uploaders and the informants that are the criminals. 

So if someone did "leak" information prematurely they are the person who would be charged. Using the information itself isn't a criminal offense in and of itself. What happens though is often the user is the informant, i.e. the CEO knows because he's doing it, so they end up one in the same.

Think about it, wife = $200k a year. Wife provides coffee, food, and blowjobs. Its easy to find an employee that will provide you with food and coffee, and its easy to find an employee that provides you with blowjobs, but its hard to find one that does all three. 

If the wife wasn't involved, you'd need a chef/secretary which will run you about 50k a year, and you'd need a hooker for about 150k a year (blue chips only for Karp), so the cost is the same as hiring your wife. But now if you want to eat caviar while getting your dick sucked, you'd have to talk to two people not just one.

Turns out all the Kennedy fried chickens were owned by unrelated people an kfc would have to launch dozens of separate expensive lawsuits to sue each and every Kennedy fried chicken. Most were owned by immigrants with no money so even if they lost kfc would be out the money.

Be cool if ICLN actually did something nice for once
r/dividends get so wet over $1 a month they don’t notice they’re down 40% on their shares
first of all:

if you buy 100 shares it'll cost you 1000$, if you buy the right to 100 shares it cost you 890$, if you end up exercising you pay another 100 $. same price if you actually want the shares but cheaper if you just plan on selling the option.

Second of all:

Options prices grow exponentially while stock prices move slowly. essentially for the 1c contract for June, if the price goes down it's no different than buying shares. if the price goes up \*quickly\* you'd make a larger profit than holding shares.
Y’all dudes are so young, why does a crash bother y’all, you can make it back and then some. I’ll be 60 next Friday so I know there will be corrections of 10-20%, but if you own great growth companies then it will bounce back quickly

So in your example, you have $1000 in call options. Current stock price is $110. You buy 100 stocks for $90 (total cost $9000) and sell for $110 (total gain $11000), so your net is $2000. But you spent $1000 on buying the options, so your net win is $1000. As opposed to $100 if you had $1000 worth of stocks. Is this correct? So the boost in % comes from the options multiplier (number of shares per contract if I understand correctly)?

They haven't banned SPACs at all. You just can't talk about ones that are under certain monetary thresholds. Agree with a tax megathread though.
Me? I'm a historian and a warrior. I don't even understand the math behind option prices.

And 2008 was no one's fault, and the biggest thing was the believe housing markets only go up. People would take out big mortgages they couldn't realistically afford in order to flip houses. Investors (both retail and institutional) would buy the debt from the banks in order to collect the interest. This created the incentive to banks to give everyone some kind of loan, knowing if they lent out too much they could just sell the debt for a small net profit. Bankruptcy was irrelevant as they could sell the houses used as collateral or more likely refinance as housing prices rose higher and higher.

Case in point: The Lehman Brothers maxed out their leverage in out to buy houses and debt. When the bubble burst the houses fell in value and a lot of people defaulted on their loans. They Lehman Brothers paid their debts... By dissolving the company. The highest profile bankruptcy in US history.

Part of it, the other part is that a share can get shorted a second time (like a share Person A shorted at $10, eventually changed hands and got shorted again at $15 by Person B). With the stock rising generally in the past 6 months, this is quite likely to have happened a lot.

He sold for cash. He mentioned that he thought about buying more shares
The way shorts work it provides liquidity, and the math comes out to actual 25mil floats. You add that with the 71 mil shorts to get the total 96million that is trading on the market. Basically they have to rebuy 75% of total shares that is likely to trade hands in the market. Though shorts probably won’t have to cover till 0%, so id say a more realistic number is 50mil shares covered, 50% total shares trading. Its hard to say how much it would affect price if shorts scramble to cover all the shares tho. VW squeeze was 13% shorts covering 19% shares trading, so 67% needed to be covered and it went 10x in a few days. We are in similar ballpark but because of different volume level, if a squeeze happen, $100 might be a good first take profit target as retails are paper hands. After that its impossible to say where its gonna be.

Flair checks out. 

Natural ways of opening up your pores helps a lot, saunas, cardio, hot tubs, etc. It's when your skins is dry that it creates excess oil that gets trapped under your pores that causes bad skin. Also if you are in cold, dry climate then a humidifier helps.
I think that's just for businesses, if you have a business you have to pay quarterly taxes on what you estimate your yearly income will be. Don't think that would apply to stocks but who know everyone here usually get to claim losses before Covid.
Personally, I prefer strikes that are closer to the money, or ITM. In situations like this, I play leaps, combined with monthlies. I'm confident in the long term position, so I'm okay if my monthlies don't hit. I'm adding to my March $25C position on Tuesday.

Good point- I swore if I just got my money BACK at 9.00 I would GET out..... Then? I waited.... and in a moment saw it Dropping down....  But as you said.... it’s not a LOSS at least Yet- I am so far in.... got the long weekend to decide my bravery level-
I didn't say anyone "just wanted to cash out." I'm simply trying to make sense of the large volume of insider selling. If they have a view of the stock jumping in the short term, why sell off so much earlier this month? Seems odd to sell low and buy back in higher, doesn't it? I wonder if it has anything to do with pulling out money to buy one or more people out? Maybe that explains insider selling leading up to the HSR exemption.
Sure, I'm happy to discuss. In fact, I wish there were a lot more discussion than their currently is. 
Here is what I think on each of the points you raise:
- I would say the shorts do not necessarily have to return the shares at some point. They can keep them for as long as the lenders let them, which could be forever. I agree the higher the SP gets the worse it gets for the shorts. What I wonder is how bad "worse" gets and how it compares to the alternative i.e. covering from the point of view of the shorts.
- I agree this is relevant but I think it can be read as brokers protecting themselves against retail buying on margin at high prices and being unable to cover the margin call when the price comes back down.
- I think it's wrong to state the shorts will never make a profit and the price will never come back down as if it were indisputable. The shorts might well think the opposite. Many people here do. If the shorts decide to get out, I think they will try to do so in whatever way costs them less. It could be by ripping off the band-aid in one go or by unwinding gradually. As much as we might want them to, the shorts will want to avoid lifting the price from the earth to the moon, as they do not want to pay moon prices (unless this somehow hurts them less than all other options).
What about lower price resistance? Its held up pretty well above 480.

Wouldn’t the question be what value the credits continue to have in the next administration?

Right and you pay a CFP because you have wealth to protect and grow.  You aren’t going to be willing to be 40 or 50 and watch 20% of your retirement disappear because the hot sectors had a bad day.  If a broker had my parents in the shit I am in I would tell them to fire him.  Different goals for different folks.  For a 25 year old with disposable income a 20% swing on a fractional percentage on their lifetime earnings doesn’t matter.  For a 55 year old who doesn’t want to eat cat food in 15 years it’s a totally different story.
Yes. Exactly.  Now that Cathie bought you should just go for the $50’s.
I'm not mistaken you are counting RC 7% twice. Right now he has ~13% as far as we know. His agreement allows him and his buddies get 7% more. So if he exercised his right, they will have 19% total. But correct me if I'm wrong.

Lidar is expensive, overpriced and cuts into profit margins. A two camera set up works just as good if not better than Lidar. That’s what it is saying. Lidar is expensive and unnecessary and has drawbacks when it comes to being able to read the road. It can map things but not actually see them/differentiate. Cameras need a lot of data that’s why Lidar is used as a short cut but it has major drawbacks and economies of scale issues.
As I understand it, Rule 201 was invoked during trading yesterday and remains effective until end of trading the next trading day (Tuesday).

GME held its price pretty well the rest of the day, until the last hour when paper-handed bitches got anxious. Even so, pretty good price strength.
Melvin Capital goes bankrupt because infinity squeeze actually happens. Their brokers have to suffer loses since they didn’t cover the margin. Many respected brokers go down since the squeeze made $GME the most valuable company in the world. Banks lending money to their brokers collapse since the money cannot be redeemed. The government can’t bailout the banks since Sleepy Joe and the senators are occupied at the Capitol. 

The world financial system collapses, chaos emerges.

My retarded brain did not understand any of that. Can someone explain.
I agree Beth Technology is a big AMD fan
Me too :(
Do you realize that the short squeeze on on VW made it the most valuable company in existence at that time? 

How much would you have paid for a roll of TP back in March if you just used your last piece and had the runs? Paper towels are usually $1 at the store and are much bigger, so a roll of TP can't be worth more than $1.5, but people were buying them for $5 a roll (and sometimes more). 

I'm not saying you are wrong, but I am saying your arguments for why aren't valid. Also, you appear to be missing that it seems the shortage (number of shorts), has only grown in the last 2 days, not decreased.
[deleted]
>	What you’re trying to do is illegal 

Yup I’d say this is on par with your usual Reddit legal advice
[deleted]
How do people not understand that over 100% of floating shares have been shorted?? This has nothing to do with how GameStop is as a company or what RC’s plan is for the future (I am bullish and fully believe even after the squeeze that GameStop will easily be $75+ in the coming years). It’s the fact that all of these shorts are bleeding with the insane interest that is on these shorts. Shares would need to get to below $15 to even start making money (and that’s being generous. Probably closer is like $8-10). Eventually they are either going to get margin called or just cut their losses. Some brokers have already stopped allowing margin on GameStop and its only a matter of time before the squeeze happens.

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I mean if you check my history you can see I've held GME for some time, I even bought the dip yesterday.

I'm sorry i'm retarded (just like the rest of you) but I've never seen any concrete proof that GME could go to $100 or beyond. I remember in September how volumes of GME DD were released that yes, GME could indeed go to 30 quite easily and possibly 60. Cut back to 3 months later and now the average DD price target is 100. Huh? I'm open to any arguments other than "hurr durr squeeze is infinite". You could see how a stock like VW could go to 800, but how could a game store go to 300? It's quite literally just greedy market manipulation.

For me, Tesla is #1 and VW is #2. The latter figured out what the EV game is about. It’s not swapping an ICE engine with an electric one. VW’s CEO Herbert Diess has “Mission T”. He sees cars as: connected mobile nodes. This guy understands what the future is about and knows Elon is doing something right. Industry 4.0 is about changing how the product is built. Using Data and AI to exponentially improve the product and lowering costs. 

Diess survived a vote of confidence last month. That should tell you something about how hard is it for legacy makers to switch.

Hey, I was told that if I hypothetically make big gains trading, I'll need to pay my taxes quarterly instead of at the end of the year, is that correct?

Has anyone written a thing on taxes and how to do this? I could do it when I figure it out if no one knows.

I’m happy to make much higher price guess than that... It’ll be $40 when a launch date is announced, push $70 with a successful test and $100 after Branson returns to Earth from his first flight. Plus, many small bumps as Woods goes on the road show to talk about ARKX.

Call me old fashioned I guess but I’m over here still playing AMD. After this little dip back under 90 I know Lisa Su Bae is just taking it back down under 90 one more time just to blast through 100 before earnings, no way amd isnt about to moon. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Side note, I’m proud of all you GME bois, I honestly didn’t think wsb would be able to coordinate the autism and pull off the squeeze so I didn’t hop in, I felt more comfortable buying the amd dip. But good job guys. You all proved were a force to be reckoned with.

Those are some cool cherries you picked, bro.  Care to share?
we'll never crash, but if we do, I hope it is now cus I have calls that exp in july.
How did the short squeeze happened if there's still like 120-170% of shorts ?

To me it feels more like an tech bubble in general and EV specifically. But who knows when/if the bubble bursts. But maybe I’m just salty I never got into TSLA

This? Makes sense.  
The post? Not so much.
Just want to point out with your price comparisons, Best Buy has ~264million shares outstanding, Corsair has ~92million and gme has ~69million so even if it did reach Best Buy’s shares price of 114$ they still wouldn’t have the same valuation.

What I'll say is people are excited over Cohen. We don't know what he is going to do or what the plan is, but many are certain he had a plan and it will make gamestop very profitable.

It might be a go to for games, consoles, and accessories. It might be sold out to Amazon, hard to say. People are certain it will become an online powerhouse though.

what happens if MM's decide to buy shares at $35 each
On Mon, Jan 11, Gamestop announced it would follow a plan from RC Ventures (one of its largest stockholders, and including Ryan Cohen who made Chewy into a billion-dollar company) to change its board of directors to include Ryan Cohen and two of its members. Ryen Cohen said "We are excited to bring our customer-obsessed mindset and technology experience to GameStop and its strategic assets. We believe the Company can enhance stockholder value by expanding the ways in which it delights customers and by becoming the ultimate destination for gamers. Alan, Jim and I are committed to working alongside our fellow directors and the management team to continue to transform GameStop. In addition, we intend to bring additional ownership perspectives to the boardroom."

At that point, you need to remember, the stock had been under apparent intentional short selling pressure for months/years, while actually steadily growing in price for \~6 months since August when RC Ventures first invested. In Dec, RC Ventures added a few million shares. Monday's news was enough to make people think..."maybe this will be very good...but we'll see, if it goes up, there's an additional incredible profit chance given the short %," but not to immediately buy in. Wednesday, to be blunt, somebody started buying in, and lots of others who had seen the **high potential of Gamestop with the guidance of Ryan Cohen and other e-commerce smarties**, combined with the **INSANE short % of a steadily GROWING stock**, decided to join the gravy train. The reasonably positive outlook and the massive short % had been exerting a positive pressure on this stock for a long time; there just needed to be a catalyst to start the rocket 🚀. The short % pressure meant that if/when that catalyst came, it would lead to a VERY strong push. For whatever reason, that catalyst happened Wednesday, and with Monday's news, it was enough to start the VERY strong push.
Monday then?

Yeah but you also need a good exfoliator and a cleanser. Plus some vitamin c serum and maybe some retinol.
Yes, BB is cheap, that is why people are pumping it. You’re missing the key component to as why it’s cheap though, because it is seriously undervalued. This isn’t a literal pump and dump, this a pump into a company who is dramatically undervalued, and people are now starting to see the value. It will continue to grow, and there’s many incentives for it to.

Sorry but no, ppl don’t fall for this bull. The play is either steel dynamics or X but NOT MT! 

There has to be some heavy heavy shorting going on with MT. And keep in mind that this could be going on in Europe. It goes up a bit then every single time there’s a downtrend the rest of the day. Also plenty of articles showing société générale changing the number of shares they hold.

Don’t buy MT don’t waste your money.

Shave it off. If you take it and decide to stop all your hair is gonna go even quicker.
Issue is that while there’s definitely an increase in retail long interest, short interest is also going to continue to increase the higher the price goes (unless there is actually a squeeze). Any negative news or 2-3 Qs of continued losses/bad performance could be bad.

But for the next 2-3 months we should only be riding on positive catalysts so no stress. Don’t see any short term negative surprises coming up.

Is it though? I work in equities and this is hard to prove. What if a large investor comes in and says they now believe in GME’s turnaround story? Basically what Ryan Cohen is doing, but no board seat.
Of course, I can’t find the specific case or I’d share it. But basically robinhood designed their system this way and it was being used exactly as it was designed. You could argue that because this has to do with financial markets it’s slightly different, but it’s hilarious that RH wants to both take back profits earned AND hold people accountable for losses. If the profits are theirs then should the losses.

tell if multiple accounts are on the same IP and do an IP ban. You saying you’re evading bans plus multiple accounts would be plenty for admins to IP ban you. This is all assuming anyone actually cares. I’m just reporting this for anyone who might not know how Reddit works. Please don’t mistake this for me actually caring what you do.

Because BB was also blowing up at the same time? It’s not that far fetched, GME isn’t the only stock on the market that is under valued, and of course GME has the huge short interest (BB has some too, just not near the levels of GME). If you look around from the past couple months people have been posting DD on BB, some people when it was 6.50 I remember, and it’s now 9.50 with a peak of 11.50 since then.

They might end up, like one of the other keystores around.

However, what got me into investing to GME, is the underrating in December. If you take a look at their revenues (\~6-7 Billion annualy)and compare that to the Market Cap (\~2.5 billion)   


I see potential, even more, if they can e.g. shift their used console/games after market to an online business, I guess that is my biggest, hope, that they are becoming the **ebay of Games**, but maybe I am just retard, dunno

I always find it funny how these people don’t understand rules of sell-side Wall Street. They think that because a company is selling a stock on public markets, there is no way it could be a scam or fraud. If they are involved in a scam stock (unknowingly usually), it’s okay because they’re making money and should encourage others to buy. Wall Street wouldn’t just sell you garbage, right? 

When in reality Wall Street exists purely to get you to buy whatever they’re selling. Could be good, could be garbage. Wall Street do not care as long as they collect their fat fees.
As always : if you sell, not only you lose money, but you make them win

If DFV can hold though a year seeing millions of profits you can also hold one more week if shit hits the fan. They want you to panic sell and be a paper hand bitch. Don't be, and let's fuck Melvin together. If this dips further i'm doubling down on GME 🚀🌔

Can someone with a PHD in GME explain to me how there are 1 million shares on Iborrow/trade website available to loan? There should be less. Or was it from shares sold by leaving board directors??

Selling options quickly tends to work better, shares are the one where you have to decide. I often sell shares in like 20% increments once it hits my price target of selling

This is called the merger spread and it's directly related to the risk of the deal falling through, you can calculate the approx risk. This isn't free money any more than options are free money, you're being paid for the risk you're taking. That spread usually closes almost entirely by the time a merger is imminent

I had a limit order on Friday for open at $10.59. it hurt so fucking bad to watch it go to +$100 and instead of tapping out there I watched it slowly fall down to -$100 by the end of the day. Shitty. I'm confident it will go back up though, Friday just sucked all around for everyone.

Ofc long term implications are unknown but for people that are 65-80 years old there is no long term complications they will be dead anyway.

I agree fully ... that's why I'm having trouble fitting the recent insider selling activity into the picture. It's the only thing that jumps out at me as a possible red flag. Sankar for example seems to have sold 1,000,000 shares on 11/16 (or 30% of his stake unless I'm misinterpreting this). Maybe something unexpected happened this past week that's compelling them to want to buy back some of what they sold earlier in the month? But when I say t hat it feels like I'm just reaching for confirmation bias. Haven't come up with any other ideas though.
My 1/22 11.5c’s depend on this

Be careful swing trading though, I sold at $20.7 on Wednesday and then it mooned to $38.37, touching $42 on Thursday.

Only sell when you're 100% sure it won't go any higher. I wasn't 100% sure, but my impatience costed me $5000 in gains. I can live comfortably for 5 months off that kind of money here where I live.

EDIT: I still made $2700 swing trading GME before that, so swing trading has its place, but just be careful is all I'm saying.

Cause it's not like borrowing physical objects (like borrowing your friend's copy of a CD).

Shorters tell their broker that "Imma sell X shares at this price." Brokers don't care how many there are, as long as the shorter can give them back that balance in shares.

I don't think I'm making much sense so it's vaguely like how you can spend huge amounts on your credit card, even more than next month's paycheck. These things are numbers instead of physical objects so it's possible to owe them several times over.

Tl;dr GME shorters are doubly screwed and 🚀🚀🚀🚀

BB has been short sold for a while now and they increased volume from 14% to 16% recently. TUTES are at about 53%. Extremely bearish. Options were up on Friday and a lot of puts bought. Shorts are covering this week from that pretty big increase of close to 50% of their volume. Maybe part of the reason.

it’s amazing how you still feel confident about its current valuation when the market is forward looking. i urge you to come back and review the share price once the shorts are covered when most of the people who are invested in this stock are here to ride the short squeeze then gtfo. just by the way you talk, it’s pretty clear you’re just a beginner trader who got lucky from a few trades. well done, but you can’t even realize your biases.

i accumulated higher returns than your current investments at one point which was my peak, but not once, did i think my investment ideas was a surety. however, i thought they were logically sound investment ideas. but boy was i wrong.

i just think it’s premature to call how much GME should be priced at just because a dying company spiked once short term. it’s great that you saw the short squeeze - but it still lacks proper fundamentals. i emphasize and reemphasize this once again, but short squeeze is the only thing that’s going for them.

Holy shit this thread is funny
I’ll try to help.  LEAPs both make millionaires and destroy wealth.   The far OTM calls are often called LEAPs.  (Look it up).  The Jan’23 $50 Calls are about $7-9 a piece (amplified by 100).  One call = $700-900 to buy.

They are $50 strike in my example.  They are “OTM” out of the money, very far out of the money in fact because PPS is only $25 right now.
Lets say you pay $9.  By the expiration date in Jan 2023 you need the share price to be a MINIMUM of $59 just to break even- because the calls will be worth approximately their intrinsic value on expiration day.  

For every amount over $50 on the day of expiration the contract value will grow.

If the PPS is $75 on day of expiration the contract will be worth $25.  You paid $9.  You made almost 3x.   Meanwhile if you bought shares today for comparison you’d make about 3x (75 / 25 = 3x)...  around $75 PPS the share and calls perform similarly...

NOW let’s say he is right (he’s not, it’s overzealous but only by a little...) and the share price is well into the $100’s; let’s say $150.
If he bought shares today that’s a 6x gain.... but if he bought the Jan’23 contracts they’ll be worth approximately $100 per contract ($150-50 = $100 intrinsic value on day of expiration). He only paid $9 per contract.  So that’s an 11x on calls versus the “mere” 6x.

And this is all using the day of expiration and intrinsic value only as examples.  The calls can outperform the shares much faster due to inefficiencies, liquidity, and “Greeks”.

When you see some of the market made millionaires they’re often because of LEAPs- far OTM calls on high conviction plays.

I think PLTR will be $60-80 by EOY ‘21 and $120-160 by EOY ‘22 potentially with some wild fluctuations along the way.  I think the revenue and profitability will surge and WS will cave after 1-4 more blowout earnings and start rating it appropriately.  For this reason it is also essentially my all-in as well with about $550k including $200k worth of you guessed it- the Jan’23 $50 calls.
It’s a 10x disparity, my dude. Also, as TSLA matures they’ll  also be exposed to those liabilities.
What’s the source of the meme?
Look at the last price run up & the dip after and the severity of it compared to the most recent run up. Identical pattern with a less severe dip. It’s going to consolidate here for 1-2 weeks I believe and rip on earnings.
Bench????
I’m sure they’ll do great. The company also has lots of great things to look forward to in the future. 

With that said, the shit doesn’t move. It’ll probably stay flat smh

First i doubt there was a $690 (pre split) call in Oct 2019 going for $0.31. Stock was already near $350. And deep OTMs are very expensive. I doubt anyone was even selling these with Jan22 expiration. 

Assuming it was there, no one will hold it till now, not selling at 1000%? 10,000%? 100,000%? Lol. Impossible 

Unless OP is an insider and he knew on expiration date stock will be $4200.
You do realize ban evasion is against Reddit’s rules right? I mean, I could care less but it’s possible some mods will, just FYI.
Well if it's more than $250 you would itemize and attach the receipt. Taxes are sneaky so at this point if you go that route I recommend an accountant. It's maybe 2-3 hundo for piece of mind and the maximum refund or minimum payment.

I'm trying to sell but I'm driving and am struggling to focus on both the road and the app. By the time I get in the stock price has fallen by half. 

This is the trading equivalent of running at half the speed of smell when being chased by a murderer.
There is short interest representing ~140% of the shares available.  That’s why this is the opportunity of the decade. I don’t know exactly what the short interest was on the VW short squeeze but I think it wasn’t even 100%.
In order for the short squeeze to be over, the shorters have to close their position or at least lower the total short to 50 percent or lower. They haven't. It hasn't happened yet.
Well duh, GME is just 10 times better than your average stock

I love it. Doing something similar at about 20% of your totals.

Question about short puts. Why are you still holding them? Most juice is gone by now. My guess is that they lost 2/3 of their value in last week's rip and now you are left with the last 1/3 for another 3 months. I mean 1/3 is still 11k.

Just wandering what your thought process is.
Depends on how fucking stupid the militias are.
Maybe not the whole , but a lot. Just debt alone ( lookup comparison of enterprise value ) covers a large amount. This is the reason why you're having the current difference in opinion about the number of cars they need to produce in the thread above.

But I agree that it might not cover the whole thing currently , which is why I put the disclaimer in the last line.

Thank you for the kind words. I am highly convinced the big short(s) are feeling the burn and thusly the bot/disinformation campaigns are ramping up. This is part of their playbook and surely we’ll see more before we see less.

I think it’s highly plausible that Gabe Plotkin following DOMO is connected to him selling out early.
I agree with ur things. personally I dont play with spy calls, but can seem like a solid play. I might buy 1 contract and see how it goes. u think the bubble will last until june of next year tho? I see a big correction coming end of this year (tax reasons, crazy aftermaths of inflation, overevaluation of companies, etc).
I can't see it going down any further without a broader market sell off. I suppose it could continue sideways, but I thought stonks go up?

True. And maybe a counselor will help with that but considering the stories I've heard about how that shakes out, I would be making damn sure I tried every other option first. How long is "a while"? Cause a couple months probably isn't going to cut it.

It's tough though. I sympathize with your situation. When your woman doesn't want you anymore it is the worst feeling in the world. You feel trapped and worthless. When the one person you care about the most rejects you, that cuts deep. When it happens over and over it really knocks your self esteem. What's that phrase, better to be alone than with someone and lonely?

But it takes a while to bounce back from. So be kind to yourself about the process and how you're feeling. Appreciate the progress you have made. Even if just a little. Definitely consider therapy for yourself before couples counseling to get some additional perspective. I would not tell the wife about it, people still have messed up views about mental health and I worry she'd only think less of you.
Dude I started with 11k in March. I put my house in forebearance! So needless to say gme can’t fail or I’m fucked Bc I got it all in there lol
I drive a Tesla and it’s fantastic, but the whole autonomous driving isn’t happening anytime soon. When the sun is low camera’s are blocked. When there’s a tiny bit of rain the camera’s are blocked. In other words you are dependent on the weather so the whole robo-taxi fleet isn’t happening either. I guess they will need lidar after all.

Dont buy shares with margin.  Some brokers have rules where if yo have shares on margin they can lend them to short sellers to cover their positions.  This hurts the cause.  Also because the stock is already super leveraged you might get margin called on your leveraged shares and be forced to give up your positions if you can’t cover the cost of the shares you have on margin.  This also drives the price down and hurts the cause.  Buy what you can with your money. Don’t buy shares on margin

Are you saying people who just say "BUY GME/PLTR TO THE MOON" are essentially collaborating on an illegal pump and dump scheme? Because they are not presenting DD for others to make up their own minds? 

I certainly see the pump. I never see the dump posted. 

We are going to start seeing a lot of posts that say "Not financial advice " in the bottom corner. 

Also, the op needs to chill out. Chad's who are mad that a larger share of the public found the buy button on a stock site need to sit down.

Agreed! I keep saying Sir Jack a lot is a pump and dump scheme. I even reported it to the mods and nothing happened! 

A bunch of high schoolers are going to get burned, and worse on margin with a dumb yolo play.

Hopefully someone doesn’t  “off” themselves because of it.
I’ll never understand the mental gymnastics it’s takes for TSLA bulls to assume most people don’t see the potential when the stock is already being priced as if the potential future is a certainty. 

How can you on one hand proclaim people just don’t get it, while at the same time have a stock that is trading at insane multiples precisely because people not only “understand it”, they are betting on it as is obvious with the stock price. 


The tech bubble happened precisely because everyone saw the future coming. Amazon traded at insane valuations because the market saw the potential. AND THEY WERE RIGHT.

Yes. Insiders and institutions own 45m of 69m shares. WSB owns 5m. 

Shorts sold 72m shares. Meaning there is 140m long interest that needs to be bought down to 25m by the shorts.

I’m with you and I’m not. It very unrealistic to not expect profit taking for people who are taking big positions, taking on huge risk (i.e. a large portion of their net worth). It’s one thing if you’re putting in 25k or less, sure diamond hand. It’s another to tell someone who is up a down payment on a house, or a house for that matter to hold no matter what.

It should start running for a start . Has become such a lazy retired boomer stock .
Meh, not really. A pool of investors would give him money and he would use that massive buying power to cause a lot of activity in the stock so he could push it up and sell it higher. There is nothing illegal about that, unless they made up fake news about the stock, which Jesse never did. That's just the game of speculation.
At best he will only regulate then interest rates. People forget he’s been moderate right his entire political career.
Hey retard boomer OP, you don't need to double space after a period. It's not 1940; we don't use typewriters here.
Nice

Be VERY careful right now. A lot of brokers have stopped allowing margin for GME.
yeah I closed out my BB positions at what ended up being the second peak on Friday AM because I didn't wanna wake up Tuesday or get caught holding the bag watching big sell volume happening 

also means I can just spend the weekend reading and getting ready for tuesday with cash in my account

Tread carefully. It’s an expiration date on my call option for Jan 22nd. If you look at APHA ticker you will see that the stock price has shot up 50% after the earnings report came out. 

TLDR I paper handed what could have been a 4000% return on investment.
I think you underestimate the hype of watching your favorite team pull off that insane combo in a fight all while you hear the live spectators cheering in the background and the commentators going wild. And you can do that all without having to watch someone break their femur for entertainment like some bronze age peasant!
It’s a short combo because you’re buying puts and selling calls. The synthetic part is that it is done on shares that they don’t have.
Slipped and fell on the ice last night, puts on my face.

This was covered well on YouTube by big boss i think
370 @7.01 3 7c bought during consolidation Caught the AWS moon 5K turned to 10K. Thought it’d moon the following weeks and lost 10K. Avg down from 7.50 to 7.01 during consolidation, bought some leaps. Played Facebook settlement hoping they’d disclose the $ and they didn’t. But she still went off. Bought Thursday  1/14 8C x 30 for 1/15 and 8 7.5c for 1:15. 7900% on 8c’s. Doubled my account value. I called my friend Thursday morning telling him I’m turning on margin and leveraging everything on 8C... shoulda coulda woulda.
Like the Op said, she’s oblivious to news sometimes, sometimes she goes for 50% in two days. 

I think the news wasn’t the issue it was about cash on hand. BB is established, we know this- can they successfully create this new ecosystem and moon? Sure but it’s gonna cost money. Between the fb settlement and then the selling of patents I think that showed wallstreet they will be doing this right.

Some of the posts on here are fucking bots pumping tickers for MMs.
Let's just say it involves the color Purple.
Need you to teach me how to make money off options plz. Watched YT vids. Did some research. Still seems confusing AF to me. Need it dumbed down to the point where 
If you think stock price will rise to xyz you would buy/sell a call for xyz. I get the whole strike price, expiration, etc. Do I need at least 100 shares to start messing with this? Are there training simulations out there? Any help appreciated from a true autist. Ty
Coulda had the poonami but all i wanted was Konami 😔
A standard swap. Yeah, probably.

Again, one of the key things here is that we don't know the age or value of any of the shorts so it is very possible that the shorts are years old held at prices far beyond what is known. Truthfully you could be up against a $60 short from 5 years ago and just have no idea. They haven't even lost money yet.
An artist autist?
Just hold and you may be okay. The 12c’s are obviously teetering on an ass fucking for you, but at the same time I think your 10c’s will end up printing.
No. Shares bought in margin accounts don’t count, they just get loaned out and sold again.
Strike?
DO NOT RELY ON THIS WEEK, WE COULD GO DOWN. The MMs are going to try and shake out those who are too dumb to be retarded. Don’t expect anything until the week of the 25th. If it’s next week, great but their shorts don’t expire until the end of the month
Do you know what happened after 2007 and has gotten worse ever since? QE, fiscal stimulus, and low or negative rates. Shorting anything is a fool's errand until you can predict a liquidity crunch or deleveraging like in March, or a specific massive failure like Luckin Coffee or Solarwinds.
Not quite...

Big money has an ear to WSB so the tardation spreads through the system, big money making dumb af plays.

Michael Burry is shorting Tesla. Might not be a bad idea now...
Apple needs 5-10% run up this week.
I'd probably just buy a few FOTM LEAP PUTS on SPXL or TQQQ or some other 2x-3x leveraged bull ETF, also a few VXX or VIX calls. I'd have to do a lot more research to see what is likely to hurt the most in a correction, but it's easier to just bet against a 3x bull. IV goes through the roof, meaning a FOTM might triple or quadruple in value even if it never goes in the money.

I've got 1 in SPXL right now, but might roll out to a longer date and pick up 2-3 more. I'll only spend 5-10% on this as I don't think it's imminent, but you never know. I try to buy into bear positions on bull days and bull positions on bear days.
Yeah but it is the next blockbuster.
Make it a fun surprise when he does your taxes this year
truly retarded but also dont buy on margin
ARKK and ICLN. It's literally free money if you hold leaps for a few months.
GameStop can only issue $100m in new shares. 

So that won’t end the pressure.

Agreed.

We won't know for sure that's a certainty, but I see $BB more like as an appealing backup plan for those that didn't go on GME early. There's been a few amazing DDs about it and it's really appealing, it has a bright future. I don't think it will end up like GME, I got some in BB just for the longer play, with what's on the road for them they can only go up !

If you want therapeutics look at SRPT. Mommy Woods bought 945k shares few days ago
Not typically. It usually leads to a decrease in the share price because the number of shares outstanding increases. More supply to feed demand. Also, the newly issued shares are usually priced below market so that usually drags the market price down as well.

Tbh the thing with charity is, as soon as money is involved, there are more black sheeps then good ones and money gets holed up in "fees" and "Standard expenses" etc and only a friction of it ends up where it needs to be. Support peoples fundraisers instead, hit up your orphanage with toy gift cards, buy a shit ton of land and turn it into a protection zone. Open a company and employ people that desperately need a job etc etc.
Last night I dreamt that I saw the chart shoot directly up and when I checked my shares they were worth 90 million dollars.  I was like "THIS IS IT" and tried to sell but then the whole thing shut down and I was like "oh nooo SEC" and then it reset and the price went back to 38 a share.  Then I woke up

So yeah I'll keep you guys posted

keep in mind "insider trading" also has to involve willful exchange of information, and possibly exchange of compensation.

If you are at lunch and overhear some ABC corp executives are bragging about Q4 earnings results that haven't been released, and then you go buy 1000's of calls - that doesn't count.
so let them do it so they get the SEC on them. Too many tards that take themselves too seriously anyways
John Chen is a fucking Chad icon, the one mythical alpha god we deserve
If you check the GME chart it had near identical movement on Friday. I also suspected something was up. I figured maybe it had to do with the insane option activity on these. I don’t know too much about how market makers work but from my understanding.. as the weekly calls get closer to expiring worthless, the MMs start selling the shares. On top of this, the overall red market, people taking profits, and day trading shorts.
Well said, I think earnings will be solid and 2021 will be a strong year for contracts

Where's your short ratio data from? Yahoo finance's data was updated 31DEC. The NYSE reports short ratios data on a monthly basis, and their calendar says next reporting is 15JAN. I don't understand where all this people and websites are pulling this "daily updated" data from.

I’m long GME but I’m definitely cashing out when it MOASS and get back in after the squeeze has squozen
On mobile so don’t have the link but the short interest increased from around 71M to 79M with only around 69M shares outstanding.
Down currently but hopeful
Nobody buying only stocks is losing much money right now. Stop gambling on options.
380%+call, bought to close and jumped back in to end up -52% by the end of the day. Still green nonetheless.
Don't need everyone. Honestly we autists aren't the biggest factor. Institutional and insiders are keeping the available float low, compared to the massive SI. Thank god the thesis doesn't depend on us. 

Most of the shorts are already underwater. Every event for the next year will work against them: return to profitability, console cycle start, debt payoffs and credit upgrade, high fees to short, retail rebound post-rona, RC confirming board control, share recalls for board elections, GME acquiring some hot start-ups and shit with our tendies, digital buyback program, more revenue sharing agreements, possible buyout, activist whale see squeeze opportunity, etc. As market cap looks more reasonable (I mean, it still does), bankruptcy thesis recedes into history, there's going to be downward pressure on shorts, maybe not a MOASS, but higher peaks coming. That's what I'm in for.

What happens is these companies use this money in their daily activities. Hence “public shares. 
You pull a fast one and make their stock more valuable and then the company is approached by the shorter douches and they try to run the business tell them to cut this go all online blah blah and then you end up with GameStop. 

Now GameStop has a potential to grow because of you autists, but how many stay invested? Once the next meme pops you pull out of GME the company now goes tits up. They already are contributing to the unemployment rate, next it will be the tanking of gme which allows their longs in Amazon and Walmart to grow and dividends increase and they can short your next move. Pay the fuck attention guys.

Counseling for my marriage made things worse because it just brought up old shit from a third party who didn’t know what we had. It made us agree that we both hated counseling and that was nice for awhile. If we would have stuck with it for 2 years, we maybe would have made it but I doubt it. And I doubt I’d be feeling sexual for those two years while figuring it out

I lost all sexual desire after doing a grown man’s laundry for years and cleaning up after the family and working and doing a majority of everything while my husband did improve himself, mentally, educationally, physically. He is a great dad who lived like a king while I felt like a slave. And we still got along and joked and loved each other and did family things. I just did not want to fuck him or touch him at the end of the day tbh. I’d look at her day and what she is doing, if she is overwhelmed in the slightest, that will make her not feel sexually attracted to you at the end of the day. I could be completely wrong but shit, it’s worth a try if you haven’t considered it yet

True. Since he's more of a centralist neoliberal I doubt he would actually do anything. I'm just over here with no student loans and wondering if I should take out a subsidized incase he actually does forgive that loan. No other loans and it's subsidized anyway, the only thing that could go wrong is that I spend it or lose it in the stock market and can't pay it right back in full after graduation; I don't need the loan but if its gonna be forgiven that's free money

Don't buy weeklies. Buy further out so you can have time to grow. I typically look for leap opportunities. DFV held his GME for more than a year. WSBG held TSLA for more than 2yrs. Even if you don't know how to pick just buy leaps on ARK funds. ARKG is going to be a huge runner in 2021.

So why are you talking about cars. At current levels, TSLA replacing every other auto manufacturer is priced in.
I feel if the sole reason A Karp & execs took their firm public was just to overload their shares for a quick buck then they’d be doing their last 17 years of work a massive injustice. What do you think? I’d have thought they’d have gone the IPO if it was all just for monetary gain.

Yes
I wouldn’t stress about buying the top. BB looks like it’s on the come up and is a decent fire and forget IMO.
If I am not mistaken

Premium (contract value) only increases if share value decreases at a specific rate based on Greeks/IV stability and multiplied if volume increases as well.

For puts, the faster the share value drops and the more that contract is bought (volume) the higher the “premium” goes or, if you were, value based on the greeks that the seller set it at.

With all that’s happened with GME, you can see those fuckers writing hit pieces to help contain the price. It’s so obvious. The wording they use is clearly to scare people - it’s not fair or neutral at all. They are paid to say a certain thing. Motley fool, Barron’s, seeking alpha - if they’re so smart about investing why are they writing articles instead opening up a proprietary trading fund themselves? 

Oh it’s because they don’t know what they’re soing

I also don’t get how one individual can be isolated out when these obvious GME and BB shills have been running absolutely rampant these past few weeks. It’s fken absurd how the whole sub has been taken over like that.

mark my words bro, they are going to print bigly. dip to 24.5 on teusday followed by massive 28+ run on thursday, friday.
Funny part is this is one of those things which is obviously bad but if I recall correctly, nobody was charged. 

There was a time where some very sus DD would show up and the sub would shut down for a couple days quite frequently. I am assuming there is a screening process to some degree as well as a much more sophisticated method of tracking who is posting what on this sub, because back in the day there was a lot more downtime to snuff out the folks breaking the law. 

Watching these children openly try and manipulate the market through collective action is kind of surreal. People go to federal prison for that shit and they are posting it on reddit publicly. I personally feel like every idiot who posts GME 🚀 should be permabanned for complicity in a federal fucking crime.
The short thesis on GME is the same when applied to BestBuy, Panera Bread, Home Depot, Target... not 'wrong' per se just overapplied, and therefore kind of useless.  Otherwise all retail stonks would be shitting the bed.

If a new company like Tesla was making the same amount of cars as these legacy ones they'd be valued much more than these are. All existing manufacturers are being valued less than what they should be under ideal circumstances , due to much higher amounts of debt , pension liabilities , [labour strikes](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/30/gm-strike-highlights-how-shift-to-electric-cars-puts-future-auto-jobs-at-risk.html) ,  investments in ICE technology and tooling that might not pay off as govs mandate EVs , [dealers that they now need to pay off to close](https://www.thedrive.com/news/37801/gm-will-pay-cadillac-dealerships-over-500000-to-go-away-if-theyd-rather-not-sell-evs) etc. Also margins on a lot of those cheap cars is very low. It's how android's have such a large market share but such a low percentage of the profits.

Not to say TSLA isn't overvalued , but something to keep in mind while comparing.

This.  Take whatever Barrons and Seeking Alpha is saying and inverse them.  The fact is that they are paid shills.  People only pay shills when it benefits them and makes them profit.

There's a good case to be confident in it long term. The console cycle means they'll be flush with cash short term to give Ryan Cohen the funds he needs to start the transformation. If he succeeds the price points that GME had in the past are on the table with ATH being 63.30. There's ba lot more stuff like difference in float sizes and market size that people can point out but honestly I think it boils down to a bet on Cohen

Just depends on the ticker. Low volume, low float tickers like many SPACs, absolutely and you're seeing it here more and more.

Larger stuff it can happen as well but it won't move it all that much unless we trigger some HFT algorithms. We can move the market in the sense that the broader market is now talking about us on the regular though.

FWIW, I recently read that 25% of all daily trading volume in 2020 was RETAIL volume which is absolutely unheard of. Like, double most years. Combine that with the fact that the majority of money in the market is now passive money coming in on a regular basis and you wind up with some interesting things that can happen.

If the strike hits, I profit on the stock since it exercises at the strike I wrote , and I keep the premium I got for the covered calls too. If you own shares at a cheap price you’d almost be a fool not to be writing covered calls with these premiums.

I do it on pure principle because I despise the tax prep industry and what they've done to all of us. We have to file taxes, instead of them being filed for us, literally only because they lobby hard to keep the IRS from doing so. It's disgusting, it's literal textbook rent-seeking, instead of being a competitive business with any value. I will not cave and give them a single dollar. Fuck them.
I'm holding these positions not because I want to own MT long term, but rather because there is a fortunate scenario in the steel industry, and MT has the best positioning to capitalize from it.

Most of the work I do at my small firm is in commodities/raw materials speculating. I'm only attempting to capture a large move over a small period of time.
You fucking retarded? They want you to get emotional and bankrupt you every paycheck. You are just gonna cause them to win.

> What you're trying to do is illegal. 

If market manipulation is illegal, why are big money firms allowed to short so heavily to artificially drive down prices?
Technically yes. If people try to call a top on the squeeze and short it, but the price keeps going up, they will magnify it. But damn, imagine shorting the very top of a squeeze. Thats like riding the wave back down and gaining double.

Anything these people say is incredibly shady right now. Something fucky is happening.
Yes , someone always has to buy it back but the market is full of bots and MMs providing liquidity so you should never have a liquidity issue on a decent stock. If you buy some random ass stock with daily volume of 100k, the options will be even less liquid and have a huge spread too so it's not recommended. Also, if it's expiring soon and is like 30% Out the money , you're probably not getting anything other than $1 for it, if it even fills at all.
Thank you!
There has a been a few companies lately that the lockup period had no negative impact. DKNG is another one that happened a couple weeks ago
They actually make a lot of sense on stocks that aren’t nearly as volatile as, say, GME right now.  

Imagine you own 100 shares and decide to sell a call way out of the money at a strike price that you expect the stock to never reach, theta is your friend here and you’re literally making money on top of money.

Hey this idea is possible.

I think dark pools do have some impact on the market price because the market makers, hedge funds, and HFT’s have access to dark pools. 

The only way to leave no price record, is if they do a securities swap agreement where they swap one security for another. (Which was mentioned in one of the WSB posts earlier). Or if it’s a private transaction outside of the dark pools, but I am not familiar with those or how it’s done.

Still think GME is a good buy, 35-36 seems to be a support, but next week may be crazy due to Political catalysts. Keep an eye open. See a lot of upside potential.

I know Cannabis has been boosted recently by Dems taking over, but I am not too familiar.

As long as you put some cash in the market you are more inclined to keep an eye on it and you will be more personally invested in doing research. At least dip a toe in if you are not sure!

Get information from multiple sources and try to sort out the noise.

Gonna buy 50 more shares
Do you just give them the 1099-B?
Here's hoping
Sure.  Calls are a contract (option) between you and another party to buy shares at a predetermined price.  The options are almost universally in blocks of a hundred shares.

What that means is that if you exercise a contract, you bought a hundred shares.  In the context of what I said above, what I meant was that people exercised a hundred shares and held the hundred shares.  Most of us gamblers simply do not have the margin or cash to buy the shares even at the predetermined price.  Let's say I got 100 options of GME at 30 and it closed at 35.  Discounting whatever premium I paid, I made 5 bucks a share.  Thats great!  But, I simply don't have the 30000 dollars it would cost to own them (30*100).  So, it immediately gets sold back out.  That increases the supply from the covered call (there are very, very few naked call sellers out there.  In fact, its the highest option level for most brokers that you have to qualify for) as it releases the locked up hundred shares.

So, I am saying that about 90% of those shares resulting from the exercised call are back in circulation.  Not really a good thing.

Wanna hear something crazy but true? If you take their deferred revenue from last year in software & operations they trade at a P/E similar to Amazon. Tesla reinvests everything into growth that’s why you see that. But once that exponential growth is hit it’s going to be pure tendie town.
Thank you I haven’t followed for a TP during squeeze. All I saw was price target before
BB next right fellow degenerates??? 🚀🚀
I can’t say for certain but in my opinion, anyone still shorting this stock is foolish because of that SEC rule. So, if you haven’t loaded up on shares yet. Do so. Do it with cash, NOT margin. If you’re going to use margin make sure you have other equities to cover.
I’ve been coming at it from this angle for a while man and while there were some positives she still hasn’t made it out of the forest. Self awareness was something I lacked before all of this and it’s been the biggest game changer for me.

For what it's worth, if a poster is telling you to hurry up and get into a position, you're being invited to give them an exit. Or in other words, if their move was so stellar, why would they give you all the info to make the same moves?

There's a big reason that becoming self-sufficient, profitable, and consistent is/has been the barrier to being a full time trader. You've got to earn it with study, experience, and learning to find your OWN alpha.

What's going to be the new meme after GME?
"it's market manipulation!"

Well... yes, but all market forces are "manipulation" and the regulatory environment that makes short squeeze occur is, in fact, a market force. "Manipulation" is a fake concept that exists to de-legitimize the gains of players who are outsiders to the "conventional" investor (read: someone who doesn't have a real job).

Yes. 

But even if TSLA does those things and more, it still trades at an unrealistic P/E for a car manufacturer, which is why you made clear TSLA isn’t a car company. I agree with that assessment by the way, but the incremental investor here is buying into Musk and innovation.

This is from one of your previous posts: 

The title say it all. My girlfriend was robbed at gunpoint leaving wingstop. They took everything. They asked her to hand over everything including her wallet, phone, and keys. She’s lost her car, over $300 in cash, all her cards, and her iPhone. We aren’t STRUGGLING STRUGGLING but are very very tight with money so this really hurt. It’s gonna be hard to pay rent next this month. We live in Texas and I am wondering legal what to do next. We’ve contacted the police and given the information of the robber but now what? Does insurance pay for a new car? Is there anyway we can compensate the lost cash in her wallet? A way to get a new phone?

i 💯 agree with you and here are my own retarded observations. 

-TONS of BB posts trying to derail the GME train
-why BB? cuz it’s dirt cheap and a recognizable name. 
-hidden agenda? BB float is over 10x that of GME. good luck trying to move something with 500M float and not nearly enough shorts. 

-i’m a simple peon brain
They have to wait for confirmation
What did I say that you disagree with, or that would make you think I’m dumb?
MT has always been a meh company. The whole steel industry goes through ups and downs. The whole industry is poised to go up. Maybe I just have a personal bias against MT. Check Nucor and cmc and they have performed similarly.

Thanks so much for the reply! Is Tuesday the day the Melvin has to pay for his shorts or is a final date not specified?

Gaming is a huge market. That’s up to Ryan and the new board. RC wrote he is against B&M stores and they must change focus to e-commerce. I doubt they would’ve done this without any ideas... and they have their track record
At the end of a short squeeze the stock will drop 75% in a day. Don’t write covered calls you can only lose. The whole point is to sell the top of the squeeze before the drop.
Has anyone done some DD on how the Gamestop board choosing to offer $100 mil more in shares would affect all of this (this was referenced in their last earnings call)?

I suspect with Cohen and his two other seats on the board they wouldnt push for this, but it would also be a HUGE cash boost for them to take GME next level, so its on my mind.
Bought Thursday morning, 3 baggers already.
I like your funny words magic man.

That sounds like a confession.
I have a question for you guys. My broker offers buying with leverage. For GME they offer me 2:1. (So I buy 1 share, they lend me money for 1 more share). My question is, are the shares bought with leverage considered mine?? Are they influencing the squeeze? I am of course paying interest on the amount leveraged.

The downgrades are to suppress the price until lockup expiry, when institutions can start buying up large chunks of shares. If PLTR were break out before the expiry tutes are basically fucked so they’re doing their best to keep the price down, fear monger the lockup then buy in cheap and ride this monster up for years. It’s a monopoly rn and Wall Street knows it.
If u dont like the sub, leave lmao
Sounds legit... I'm in!
He’s not wrong, I wouldn’t advise anyone else to make half the plays I do if they were paying me.  I good CFA is there to protect as priority one and grow as priority two.  For most folks on here grow is priority one, two and three and protect is a vague concept.  

Look at some of the posts from Friday, folks down 20-30% on a barely red day.  That would get your ass fired as a CFA unless you have an insane level of trust with the client or an established track record.
It’s an APR.  

But at these rates the shorts are guaranteed to lose almost 1% of the current price every single week.  Most of them have been shorting since... $8.  It doesn’t take many weeks before that 35¢/week adds up to more than they could ever profit.  


So it becomes a game of hoping that if they don’t cover all at once, the price won’t hit $100/share.  


But as they wait... others will buy.  And they pay more interest every week.  And, while they hold their short, they can’t put that capital to work to make them money either.
Ban
It’s you’re. 
Explain how?
So, you’re saying when you reach the top and you’ve defeated the short interest which is publicly available knowledge. At that peak. You’ll do what? Hold? Hold for it to tank again? Will more buyers magically appear? They know short internet is gone. The squeeze is done. More buyers will come to buy it off you? That’s your hope?
Or will you sell it before it gets there and fuck over your pals? Will they beat you to the punch. 
You can’t all hold and make money. So, who you selling it to? 
So, just say...some of us will make out like bandits while some of you will be bag holders. That’s more accurate.
Stocks only go up
You really think the SEC would spend time and money hunting down crazy retail traders? No, they audit brokers and big investment firms. Our problem is that brokers and the NYSE don't trust us enough to let us access the real fun stuff, so we're stuck mostly with vanilla options.

But back to the original point, whether a guy has ten grand or ten million under management is irrelevant to his honesty. And hyper-competitive attitudes are a great way for many honest investors to get screwed over. You don't need to be a jerkwad corporate raider to make money.
Ok my bad for hostility.

We’ll get through it because even if the feelings aren’t there our commitment to each other still is.

I may be confused but there wasn’t much increase in December. Unless you’re referencing the hike up in the 30 days prior around November.

Thanks.
Would we care? Isn't that what we're doing anyway? And aren't we all just trying to ride a pump on the way up? Does anyone care if PLTR/GME/BB/NIO/THC🐝/Etc crashes a few months later? I mean, the latest fomo-ers will care, but they all know what game we're playing.

Every old time "legend" seems to be someone who was insider trading on the low.
Why would you make me watch that?
They couldn't... they were liable for that because it's their own massive fuckup and horrible negligence that allowed it to happen. It's frankly a miracle that the SEC didn't drop a huge fuckin hammer right in their nuts.  RH tried to sweep that shit under the rug as quietly as possible because that kind of negligence should have gotten them shut down.
Holy shit do I have to enter each and every one of my transactions into my tax form ? That’ll take hours
First post that comes to mind was that dumbass post on NIO sky rocketing from the “Chinese citizen” who said their is massive NIO cultism in China, so much so that parents take their kids to “NIO Houses” instead of to school.... psh what a dumb fucking post... any autist who believed that absolute bullshit are literally fucking retarded.

Yes. In Dec 2019 they had enough cash on hand to take it private. They bought 1/3 of the float at that time. Still have plenty of cash with low debt and a new console cycle to help while they transition. 

The shorts weren’t “wrong” this thing can still die. But the timing was very wrong. They have enough capital to likely make it 2 more years of bleeding. IF they don’t change and succeed
You think it'll go down towards earnings then up after then?

From the company:

“Net loss was ($64.4) million, or ($0.43) per share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to net loss of ($0.9) million, or ($0.01) per share, for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019, primarily due to an increase in selling, general and administrative expenses related to additional stock-based compensation expense as a result of our recent public offerings. Net margin was (24.4%) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2020 as compared to net margin of (0.4%) for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2019.”

I’m not sure about the labor expenses either, but I take it as a growth signal.
How does that relate to what's happening now?

I wouldn't invest in GME long term but there's a chance they could be profitable again if they attack the collectibles and trading card market hard. There's a huge demand for that right now.
Buy now, Li is waiting.
Yea the whole point is that you can 3-4 ATM options for the price of 100 shares.  See my example above for 04/16 ATM calls.  If you wanted to play 01/22 like a fucking idiot you could buy 6-7.  The leverage is the whole damn point.
Why don't I just wait until it drops to $16?

I’ve always said the way to cut back the bullshit of the daily threads is to limit a new comment interval to 20 minutes (not applicable for responses to comments if a thread is started).

What time frame and returns you praying for?
The higher we go the less realistic it is to think we’ll have 0% rates until 2023 like planned. We’re also fading away from a very long time of monetary policy into a future fiscal policy which will stunt momentum. You’re right 30% up and 10% down still a massive gain but 10% down over a year or longer killing things like leaps and speculative non dividend paying equities would decimate what most of this sub is about. No reason to be bear now, just change from neutral to bull to extreme bull but we’re heading for a time where a lot of what people do to win long could change. Next few years will be interesting

Dude I bought 4 months ago and doubled my money in the past few days.


Check my post history from yesterday. I literally dumped another $7,000 into GME when it was around $36, averaging way up on my shares.


No one here is pumping anything. We're literally buying every chance we get.

Yeah, well, LEAPS are sort of the casino’s cheat code.

Problem with short term options is that you’re hoping that something good happens for your stock *this* week or month, and you can’t time that. If it doesn’t, you just blew money. If it does, and it’s from a known event like earnings or approvals, you get IV crushed, so that doesn’t help either. That’s the casino part - betting that something will happen *soon*.

With LEAPS, I’m saying - yeah, I know something good *will* happen, I dunno if this month, next month, or 6 or 9 months out, but it will. I don’t care much about time because my option ages extreeemely slowly. Think cent a day. So, assuming that stonks do really go up over time, on average, I’m almost guaranteed to make money. But, these are obviously long term plays, and while I’m happy with making 100’s if not 1000’s of % of ROI per year, people here want a lambo in a week.

Theres a possible rotation coming as MM decide how Biden is gona treat tech which could play into it. I might just buy the next GME dip like the retard I am.

What you dont realize is that chump has made serious bank theta ganging on GME for months now.  That chump also made plenty of money on the way to max profit off GME shares this week.  Lastly, the chump helped the short squeeze by holding the shares on covered calls in the first place... Unless it was a naked call, in which case guy is just a chump.

This is why Im worried about the housing market.
Great post.

I remember, I think a lear or so ago, there was this same type of young enthusiasm on this sub, doing this exact same shit. With some big winners for sure.

 As soon as the financial news outlets started reporting on their success, it was not a week later when it really appeared all the institutions were just inverting wsb.  

Well, after that, all the yolo'ers literally disappeared, they lost it all.  So much total loss porn. And then the next group of youngin's slowly started filtering back in and thus the cycle repeats itself.  


I watch bloomberg news every morning for the opening bell, and they started talking about reddit traders a week or so ago, which means another great inverting is due at any moment.  And then this group of idiots will be broke, and gone, or potentially in jail for market manipulation.
2023 BUT know there isn’t a short squeeze that people are shilling. It is a good tech company that is converting their OS for other uses primarily cars.
Depends from his luck, really!
You guys are pretending..?
I opened most of my positions about nine months ago, and MT has increased over 100% since then. They appear to be the best positioned company under the current climate. Cleveland-Cliffs only purchased the US operations I believe. The demand for imports is up, and growing. Why don't you think they will continue to grow?
04/16 ATM calls are 142% IV.  You could buy 3 of them for well less than the price of 100 shares of GME stock (around $3000 vs. $3500).  The combined delta on the 3 options is around ~195 meaning the dealer has to go long 195 shares to hedge his short call delta.  So for even less capital you have bought the equivalent of 195 shares.
LMND huge dump inbound?
No, I wouldn’t. Think long term. That’s my opinion though.
If you’re serious I would say stay away , no one really knows and there’s high risk involved

Sir, this is a casino. 

I’m not even joking. Following WSB in this bull market can be profitable but you should only risk what you expect/are willing to lose. If not, your emotions can get the best of you and cause poor decision making. 

Consider your limits before you even start looking at plays. Bring what you can afford to lose. Best of luck.

GME is the stock with the best DD on this sub, if you question us, then you are the retarded one
[deleted]
So the new consoles didn't move the stock at all...you're saying that a new console launch that ALWAYS drove GME prices up wasn't atleast a contributing factor in the squeeze.

Im not arguing that its a squeeze only its sustainability.

This is the only post I've made about MT, despite having positions in it for the last nine months. Over the last six months, the underlying as increased over 100%.

I think short supply, record high prices, and large scale infrastructure development create a great opportunity. This is a good company operating in a highly beneficial environment.

If there's something I'm missing, or I'm wrong about my thesis, I'd appreciate any correction.

Cheers!

I've posted here a few days ago about how I got in on BB the day before WSB tried to meme it to the top. Cylance is going to be huge. Compare BB to Crowdstrike, except BB actually has valuable tech while Crowdstrike is better at getting large contracts.

Thanks shinereps. This is a great post. We need one like this everyday to keep the morale up.

I do think it can go higher, that’s why I’ve set a max of 1500 shares daily to sell once the stock is above my target - Would take me 6 trading days to sell 9000 shares.

I was born into the 4chan. Molded by it. I didn't see the normie internet until I was already a man.

Is there any proof the SEC actually got involved. I remember both occasions you're talking about and I remember people claiming the SEC was investigating, but I don't remember ever seeing anything backing up the claim.

I was always under the impression that it was a joke and that the sub went private so mods could clean up the mountain of shit posts.
147.5 shares at average 10.93 BB
yeah, I just meant mine does
I'm a noob and maybe I'm just extra tarded, but it seems like pumping up a stock and telling everyone to invest in it is exactly what all the financial media outlets do. Stock twits, influential investors and commentators like Cathy, they tell everyone to buy a stock cuz this is the big one. They obviously don't just pick a stock and yell thier millions of viewers or subscribers to invest. Those stocks are agreed upon to be the stock to pump and dump for the week or month or whatever. 

I think that everyone yelling GME and making posts for others to buy stock and hold is exactly what happens elsewhere online. Shit, stock twits has armies of accounts screaming at everyone to buy NIO and spacs. And they do. Doesn't seem any different to me.
Exactly and to elaborate.

The Fed fills the balance sheet of institutions. This stays as a reserve, but because of that additional liquidity, they’re EXPECTED to loan more money to customers. 

Those loans are offered at lower rates to entice people to borrow. And then that money is intended to be spent on goods and services (not equities) so the economy actually grows versus artificially inflating equities.

Many believe, and to a degree can back with data, that this much “printing” devalues the US dollar. Thus equities rise regardless because - inflation. 

It’s not that stocks are really jumping 5%, 10%, 15% at random because people are taking the Feds money and betting on stocks, it’s all relative to the original purchasing power of the dollar.

So in a way, it’s not unreasonable to see how equities got where they are. Relative to the dollars value six months ago, a year ago etc... some equity valuations are tame.

First of all,  it trading BB I am actually investing in it long term. Second of all I am not your financial advisor. Go do some DD, I am just posting my positions. There are however many reasons why I think blackberry will grow both short term and long term. Mainly they have so many partnerships. It’s not that hard to google man. I’m not even telling people to buy BB, I’m simply saying it’s something great to look into it’s still a bit of a long term hold tho.

Do you really think you’re allowed to say that after this post
Thanks for sharing. Learned some stuff I didnt know. Thanks OP.

The dramatic increase in price is NOT from a console pump. It is a short squeeze.
Gotta stay tight in the trenches boys. Remember selling is high treason punishable by banishment. Hold fast and buy the dip

Ok so they literally 2xed aapl’s eps from last quarter. It was .7 and this one is 1.4... wtf... are you telling me aapl magically gonna sell 2x more now? These market analysts retrds gonna fk up my calls if aapl gets like 1.0 eps which is great but it’s gonna look sht comparing to the wall street target... some one shine some light here...

I had people whisper me in discord because I was talking about how I'm gonna hold on $BB. They were literally that blatant about creating a community that coordinated hype for stocks. All I could think was that had to be mad illegal, why would anyone risk that.

Write Covered calls on GME to be safe if you don’t care about losing the shares you own pussies. premiums are crazy high you can make like 12-15% weekly.
if our thesis is correct this could x10, if it is wrong, it could divide its price by 3. It's not guaranteed, but it's mighty good odds.

To be honest, all the trade-able cash of every single person in this sub (plus their margin + life savings, etc) would probably only be able to raise TSLA by 0.50$. Whatever “manipulation” we think we’re doing is not real.  It’s like affecting two cheeseburgers in all of McDonald’s.
I want to believe this is a joke.
There was only 1 big screen TV in the house. We had to take turns playing video games back in my day. I watched more Final Fantasy 7 than I actually played. Waiting for my turn on Halo. NBA, NHL, NFL. Winner stayed, loser rotated. There was always a half dozen kids over.  

Watching the game was sometimes as fun as playing it. My brother could crush kids 1v3 on Halo. It was fun to watch.

Agreed, if WSB actually had the power to do this PLTR would be worth 1000. The only reason we have an effect on GME at all is because that's how brittle the situation was before we even got here. No sane firm should have shorted this much with no hedge.

Please run the numbers yourself too but with 3 months to go the extrinsic value is usually so high that i think it will be better value to sell and buy shares.

Time will tell. But usually squeezes are "events" and not drawn out very long. On top of this you don't have the data for the original positions of the shorting itself just the fact that it is shorted. There's a lot to this but given the whole concept of the two emojis (which don't make sense) there's a good chance it would go over your head.
I feel better about those falling knives I caught yesterday speeding my buy across the day. Still end in the red. Waiting to see how Tuesday goes to nab more and start selling weekly OTM CCs. Good luck, FOMO bro.

Well, I read that entire thing and not one time did I see something telling me to *not* buy more $GME, so I’ll be doing so.

Yeah that's pretty much it.  YOU won't make money, someone will. But some fat cat capitalist is on the precipice of sucking an $860m cock and every share of GME that you keep him from buying adds another inch to that cock.

The scheme is a prisoner's dilemma because in order for it to work, everyone has to agree not to sell.  But once this guy is rekt it's going to be every bull for himself and the person who wins is the one who bails first.
just tell her you bought her some shares of GME
[deleted]
I appreciate this. And I think your points are valid. 

The problem gme is facing is not just that there are a lot of ways to buy video games, but that the people making the consoles are also selling the games. If GME pivoted to a digital platform they need to convince the console manufacturers to let them have market share.

Microsoft partnered with GME because gamestop had one thing microsoft didn't. Physical stores. It's not a coincidence that microsoft closed their physical stores as they were partnering with gamestop. And now gamestop is closing their stores. Microsoft has no incentive to maintain the partnership.

Also, this post was a warning. I don't care if gamestop stays or goes. Just don't want naive college students losing money.

$90-100 is where gme was at the start of previous console cycles in terms of market cap. Could squeeze will beyond that.

I subscribe to Motley Fool, Beth Technology and Ticker Target. Good deep dives
Buying slightly OTM is fine, but if you’re yelling YOLO and buying say a MSFT call $240c 1-22 all the time, you’re going to get crushed. Yoloing is a meme on this board, and it would feel amazing to go make 3 million dollars on a 1500 dollar gamble, but just remember that’s basically like watching a highlight reel of people dumping all their chips on to green 00 on roulette and having it hit. You’re more likely to lose buying deep OTM calls instead of slightly OTM or ATM calls. Nobody ever went broke leaving money on the table, but many people went broke buying 50 dollar calls on Kodak
Can we get more posts like this instead of the millions of memes flooding the sub every day? This is the content I come here for.
Someone had to say it. 

Fucking EVERYWHERE I go on the internet, whether it’s from a random stream to a minecraft server I cant escape chat messages like ‘GME 40C’ and ‘NIO 60C’ or sometimes ‘Bought .1 shares of TSLA today!’. 

I don’t want to be a hater, but this sub has changed a lot from how it used to be. I don’t want to say it’s necessarily a bad thing, I just miss when the mainstream media didn’t mention us every single day.

Lets keep this shit under wraps.

Basically, this squeeze has more to do with the fact that institutions “own” more shares than available by owing more through buying put options.

While I do think minor profits are probably smarter for people who already have the capital; GME is set up for much higher than $65. 

If we look at the historical console cycles, if we pick the *lowest* price gain it has had, we're looking for $95 per share, so something like $90 would be a smarter PT to start exiting.

Add to that the hype that's been going on, and I think we will probably shoot past that once the ball starts rolling.

They’ve been making turds for forty years. They also went bankrupt a while ago. They missed the boat on EV even though they had one in the 90s.
Have you read the justification for those price targets? They say Tesla won’t do all of these things. That’s why they justify that price. Have you read them? I have.
I was so pissed I couldn’t get more calls with my available funds...  they shut my margin off as well, E*TRADE.
Dam right boi ! All I still need to know is how hard can we trust ortex numbers on that 77m shares short as off 14/1.
Interesting. I'm in with 900. I agree it seems like there's some major catalyst coming. The insider selling is the only thing that gets me. How does this fit with your thesis?

A circuit breaker would do jack shit about people being required to buy 72 million shares.  Margin calls don't actually stop if you turn off your phone.

The GME squeeze is fun and all.

But we all understand that longterm it may go back below $10 right? Not right away but it will happen.

That historically these console pumps do almost always sell right back off?
Omg. I forgot about that. I was old enough to know it existed but never look.

Preach
This. I'm glad I'm not the only one. A lot more negative potential than positive potential in the short run and maybe long run. Sure, the one time cost of listing and compensation was only for last quarter, but where is the growth coming from? He stated ~500mil growth needs to be maintained to break even in the upcoming years. Will the US government allow PLTR to sell to other countries? If this Tech is our advantage, why would we allow them to sell to other countries?

The dilemma would be PLTR hooking up with another Govs. We would threaten to pull out and use another company. It all comes down to if it's worth it for PLTR to lose the US contracts for outside growth. Let's play chicken. Who has the power in this scenario. I'm too retarded to understand the psyche on this and the maths on the opportunity cost for both parties. Anyways,

This is true and a significant threat to how they scale (not very well). It takes data science experts and domain experts to partner with these companies data to tailor make these experiences. Its basically like IBM Watson in that regard.

These knowledge engines aren't magic, and all voodoo AI or something. Palantir has been hemorraging money in operating expenses largely due to the nature of how they are setup (you think they'd have gone public if things were peachy in their shadow ops with the gov?)

Further, there is a major risk of impact due to data regulation with the companies they partner with.

From their own website on GDPR:
"Foundry’s flexible data protection capabilities are helping organizations prepare for an ever-evolving global regulatory environment, from the GDPR to the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) and beyond."
https://www.palantir.com/solutions/gdpr/

And beyond is a key phrase here. More is coming, and they regularly acknowledge this.

Particularly after the last year, and violent extremists on social media platforms. Big data companies that have been ruthlessly exploiting the public data will feel the pain with a Democrat controlled congress and this has bipartisan support regardless.

The downstream of that will impact analytics companies like PLTR. They probably won't be crushed by this alone but any opportunities it presents are far outweighed by the risks.

This is a major reason they've been desperately trying to diversify into other areas, but its largely small potatoes when most of their revenue still comes from the feds. Their software is not cheap, so if youre not getting the ROI... bye! (I.e. post-covid)

Google and FB are currently in the cross hairs for antitrust, but its inevitable data regulation will continue to be a major threat to large tech.

And the icing on the cake.

"We strive to contextualize major world problems and think critically about whether it's possible to engineer complementary solutions in an ethically responsible way. When the answer is no, we turn the opportunity down." https://www.palantir.com/pcl/

When the answer is "no". Yep, totally ethical and cool. 🙄

So if the answer is kill the terrorist along with 10 children or the bus driver with 20 children and 2 terrorists, based on some twitter/FB/insta data and correlating that with those hacked emails/comms/dragnet collection from the nation state government theyre partnering with is the answer for them "no" or... hmm let's talk with your experts and figure out the details. And what made this person a terrorist? Who defines the label? He was a MAGA terrorist! No he was an Antifa terrorist!

I'm sure there's no grey areas when dealing with ICE or Afghanistan/other Middle Eastern countries, or the police forces of America which are also super ethical, right? 

FWIW I am absolutely biased against them if that hasn't been made clear. I have vehemently disliked them since 2014 and will shit on them whenever the chance arises. I don't support companies that are effectively super powering the dragnet collection against entire populations of people with 0 transparency or oversight and abetting companies/governments in committing human rights violations. I suspect many others share a similar sentiment with me.

Tl;dr Best of luck to you that are on this FOMO 🚀

They have ties to US defense contractors. Their ability to 3D print complex PCBs is what draws me to them. I think the exposure they are gaining from being in ARKs ETFs will drive the stock for now until they become scaleable and start selling their products. They make up 3% of ARKQ and Cathie Wood has been buying about $1-$2 mil in shares everyday. These direct offerings seem to be creating higher floors for the stock. Hopefully they put out some good news in the next couple weeks and lay off the offerings.

This is all great information but a lot of the stuff you put in here went over my head.  Where's a good place to start to learn more about these tools and the technical terms you used?
cut off one autist, and two shall autist harder
I want Steve Carrell on Christian Bales shoulders with a big overcoat to play me and my diamond hands
Wesley Snipes has a helicopter?
Seen this before. Hope MT takes off, we're approaching the timeline.
MMs are manipulating GME by shorting it more. In theory they could get short interest up to 500% lowering the price to like $3
More like Damestop am I right?

55c March here 💎🙌!!!
From what I have read and research of GameStop. GameStop bond prices last year drop from 100 to 70 so that long put options were added to hedge this risk. As a result, short open interests were building up, way about 100 %. Then Melvin Capital was buying put of GameStop at 24. So even if GME share move up to the moon for more short sequeeze. Melvin Capital will not be hurt so much as the long put loss is the maximum and if GME go down. Melvin Capital will gain few X return ok investment. The short sequeeze is from GME 14 to 42. Now sure whether GME will go any further up. Also I look at Melvin Capital performance, they beat S&P 500 for last year period and they have AUM 13 billion. I am not sure whether Melvin Capital will be bankrupt even GME rise to the roof. Just share my opinion on GME
!RemindMe When I get to Mars 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I HAVE A DREAM that GME gets multiple circuit breakers up next week
T original squeeze itself from Melvin's puts unwound this past Friday. New shorting will occur but that won't be the original bet and thus it won't be the original short. Monday will have numbers as far as I know once these contracts settle.
True. Melvin and the shorts will be holding the bag. 

Honestly 60/40 on the short squeeze. 

Share price is still undervalued without the squeeze though.
So what happens if a squeeze with GME DOES happen, but Robinhood crashes because of the amount of insanity trying to be processed at once? 

That's going to be great times.
I feel it too, than I will take the profit and buy more BB
you got big balls on you son
There was also a recent article about how their covid tracking software was shit and HSS hoped biden would replace it. Only one article on it though. I don't think WSB meant to pump and dump, I really think they all had dollar signs in there eyes and wanted to get in on the ground floor of something that might remotely resemble the next tech innovator like Tesla.

Good analysis, thanks. I am a former investment banker and current private equity investor. I’m not sure I fully agree with your financial analysis in the third bullet, but I’m too lazy to DD this myself and do more research. I own 530 shares myself, but made the investment in future potential vs. current earnings profile

Right, same here. Red flags when determine purchase is if they add some kind of dedicated support really cheap, which to me means, "you can't use this product we will use it for you".
That guy's wife is a Stanford IT graduate though. So, it's not like she's just there for the paycheck.

First time on this subreddit, I'm buying and trusting y'all with my money 😂

I didn't think suggesting that wall street and big hedge funds might occasionally manipulate would be considered wild. The difference between the retards and wall street is that the SEC would shut us down and we wouldn't get bailed out from the government for crashing the market circa 2008. It's about time the retards level the playing field by combining our collective retard strength. Fuck em if they don't like it.

They keep grids of where and who dumped what and when at landfills I read in another article. What I find fascinatingly ironic is that Wales, who built their entire economy on digging  old shit out of the ground as coal, does not want to look for this. You can put 1,000 people to work for a year finding this thing and still make a huge profit.

Look at me.

I'm the boyfriend now.
Newbie here, if I understand correctly would that be predicting the shares to be above $50 in order to make money? If so what do you mean by it dramatically outperforming shares as isn’t that the opposite? Cheers
When all this shit is over, someone needs to explain me what the fuck happened! I’ve been reading every post, every comment and I’m am so fucking clueless it’s not funny. But...I bought a lot GME stock and calls. From what I read, this is the way.
I think it means this: 🚀🚀🚀
This. When people are unhappy in a relationship they will look for any sort of excuse to use as a catalyst. Can't put your finger on why you're unhappy? Nobody is going to support you in divorce. Your HUSBAND forgot your birthday?? You go girl.
There’s a price to pay for shorting
A massive stock market collapse would make a lot of that printed money disappear.
I have to doot in my pants... anybody got wet wipes?
You should clarify that you mean that instead of spending $x in shares they should yet $x in OTM calls; otherwise what you’re saying is incorrect. 100 shares have 100 delta while one ATM call has 50 delta (most of the time sometimes significantly more if there is a big call skew). The MMs have to be delta neutral so if you buy a stupid OTM call with <10 delta then they only have to buy 10 shares to be neutral.
Can someone teach me to go from "paycheck to paycheck" to something more comfortable and debt free?
If it does squeeze super hard what is to stop a circuit breaker from bringing down the mother ship?
Long PLTR pls fix

Lying to investors in order to change stock prices is called market manipulation and that's covered by securities fraud law. And this guy is essentially calling the whole industry crooked, which probably reflects his own workdview.
Predictions on SPY ATH this week? Or we going down a bit more ?
OP probably lost money following some moon post lol.
I think we deserve a little bit more credit than just getting in before big institutions did. I truly believe by getting Cramer’s attention and him putting shorts on blast, we jump started the institutional buying.

Before RC news this week, how many Barron’s, CNBC or MarketWatch articles had you seen even talking about the short squeeze? Personally, I had seen zero. Now, though, almost every article directly mentions the squeeze being something in play
wtf is wrong with you, you beautiful retard

So I only understand hsr in the context of m&a deals (particularly private m&a) as that’s what I do for a living, but when I’m buying a company and we have effectively finalized all negotiations or we are 99% sure we are going to buy a company, only then do we file hsr (as at that point it can leak and become public knowledge). So what that leads me to believe is that there seems to big some big buys happening in the very near term.

If you're truly interested in the financial markets and not looking to get rich quick with a yolo, you're best bet is to search out and do some reading. That's square one, and if you don't know what diversification is or how to accomplish it in your portfolio, then you really shouldn't pay much attention to options for now.

Every negative perception is rooted in the belief that the company is just another dying brick and mortar game retailer that will be dwarfed by Amazon (who really shouldn't be allowed to enter the space anyway per monopoly and fair competition regulations so this is where writing to State Representatives comes in). People are neglecting the state of VR, video game advancements, and console advancements.
And this is why an informed community is what is extremely important. A lot of people here including myself don’t know jack shit about the market extremely well. 

The spectrum of knowledge on here is fucking wide as fuck. From people who know nothing to people who know just as much as a fund manager. 

I’m all for shits and giggles when this community bags on newbies with shit, but at the end of the day, we all started somewhere and i think it’s actually very important that if we want this community to survive we have to come together and try to help educate each other on some basic and serious shit. It’s hard finding this shit on our own sometimes because there’s just so much of it.

thanks! 370 is an imp number to watch out for. We will likely drop to 355 if we convincingly break below 370. I was thinking of buying puts/ put credit spreads or inverse spy etf calls, but theta is gng to burn them everyday if spy moves sideways for a while. I can get longer dated options but I need to spend more capital on them with lower returns compared to monthlies or biweeklies. Based on this, I'm planning on just buying credit spreads. With the capital & profits, will likely buy some spy long dated debit spreads for 2x returns since it usually rallies right after that & recovers quickly. Do u have any suggestions on how I can maximize my profits or any better methods for this? Thanks!

If they could capture market share from Trex this  would be really solid. My only concern is they lost $60 million last year. But their labor expenses jumped from 4 million in 2019 to 121 million in 2020. Im trying to figure out why they had such a jump. Either way thanks for the DD

You're right about volume. I see volume in 2 places.
One says volume 153.85 

the other says 
Total volume (shares) 72.57M 

Do you know the difference? 

And not ashamed to it admit you know a lot more about this than I do.
Bahaha how dumb do you feel being wrong g@y boy. Short the stock and send me screen shot so I can laugh at you even more. Its already up to 9.50 yesterday with 75% roi this week dipsh1t and 1586% roi in a month lets see ur best undervalued pick little boy w no brain this will be 15 soon then when ark puts in its etf its going higher and once fda is out its going to 100 plus like its shit competitors.   Send me screen shot of u shorting this stock with all your money if your so smart f&^^k tard!  So looks like proved your completely ignorant, its no wonder why you make crap for money.

1. GME is heavily shorted by 140%

2. WSB create shortage in float by buying shares, 

3. several bullish catalyst driving prices up.

4. shorts need to cover by buying back shares, price goes up further (WSB hoping step 4 repeats endlessly until $100 per share)

Well yesterday they didn't have to worry about 201 yet. But yes, that is exactly what they are trying.

They might even try to play around this by flooding the order book. Who cares. In the end, they will lose!

That's the beauty of this: if they buy more and more shorts, the amount they have to defend gets smaller and smaller before hitting the margin call.

For example, let's say currently the cutoff point is 55 when they break, if they buy more shorts, the new cutoff point might be 54.8. so they have to buy even more and the new cutoff is 53. And so on and so forth.

That's why a SS is called a reverse bubble. Only they know where the red line is, but I don't want to sit in their meeting room having the emergency meetings this weekend.

I don't think molecular dynamics developed enough that they can really produce very strong scientific conclusions alone. If you look through the literature, different force fields can produce very differing structures. I'd also like to see the metrics that describe the equilibration of the system, which this paper completely lacks.   


TLDR: Molecular dynamics sucks.

This does indeed seem to be the situation.

[Investopedia reports that for the NYSE short information is released monthly](https://www.investopedia.com/ask/answers/06/shortedstock.asp). And downloading the calendar from [NYSE's website](https://www.nyse.com/market-data/reference/nyse-group-short-interest), the next release date seems to be 27JAN (see [this pdf](https://www.nyse.com/publicdocs/nyse/data/NYSE_Group_Short_Interest_Calendar.pdf)). Though I'm not sure whether we should look at the "Settlement date" or the "NYSE Group Release Date". The latter is 15JAN, the former 27JAN.

At the same time, [the website where this information is from](https://financhill.com/most-heavily-shorted-stocks-today), says it was last updated today.  I can't find any information on that website saying where the hell they're taking their info from, but the "last updated" figure might just mean the last time they checked their sources for news, so it doesn't mean that the numbers themselves represent the current situation.
Lol it’s a cowards way out if you’re scared you’ll be wrong.

I’ve researched every single car company that could come close to Tesla’s new batteries or EV tech within the next 5 years. Most companies don’t plan to have anything until 5 years from now. You can continue to not believe me. They’ve literally had press releases where they say they are 5 years away. Apples new car is 5-6 years away alone. And it’ll be priced at 100k +
If you’re young just try to max out your Roth IRA and 401k. Go all equities. Just do 100% VTI and dollar cost average (basically contribute the same amount each month). I’d suggest either a smaller “fun money” account or allocating 10-15% max if you want to try trading meme stocks/riding the bubble
you're on a sub called Wall Street bets not thinking about money.

I’m not sure if it’s not just a pump and dump - they have bad relationships with Millataru who they want to make money from - and all they do is employ software developers - but take what I say with a train or salt because all I really know about the company is what I’ve read in this article
Maybe because I know shit all about TAK, I’ll look into it

Almost 153M+ in volume on Friday. 65M on Thursday.

Average volume is 20M with a short position of 16%. Way bearish. Those fuckers are probably sitting at close to 50% heading into Tuesday after pushing price down on volume because of puts bought at 10 or less and options on the same day. For a 3-day weekend they’re holding this position!? Balls but stupidity. If you want to fuck done shorts this week, then BB is it on them covering that run-up.
I hope so! My calls dropped $4k in value yesterday.

Nah. It's a solid company. I haven't spent as much time as OP on the fundamentals but I love the ethos of the company and I love Karp. I've watched a lot of interviews with him and read a fair amount about him. I've also read about the work environment and am convinced they will continue to attract the best talent.
Turn off stock lending if you use Webull.
First off, the only thing pulled out of thin air is your assessment that they are 5-6 years behind Tesla. You have NO fucking clue where they are in the development of their technologies. But more importantly you have NO clue about what partnerships they may have with other companies that are developing technologies parallel to compete with Tesla. Those deals often times ARE fucking secrets. BIG secrets that are often protected behind NDAs that come with consequences if broken.

Buddy, wsb is dragging the rest of reddit closer to itself. What you're seeing all over the site are the bunch of college-age / late 20s idiots who come to reddit FOR THIS SUB ALONE to try and make a quick buck.

Check yourself, Six Years. What WSB has done to reddit since the pandemic started is insanity.

You can assume that IV is constant and focus on delta/theta alone. Ideally, you don’t do this on stocks with inflated IV because LEAPS suffer from IV crush just like any other option. 

You’re not betting on binary catalysts for highly volatile stocks here. If anything, you’re betting that volatility actually goes up over a period of time and the stock just organically does well.
Why would this be faked? I use the same brokerage and saw the same thing. This isn't unusual to happen for stocks that have a large decline on heavy volume.
This is Wall Street bets I don't give a fuck if you take it seriously or not go fuck yourself

The problem is the solipsicity of your opinion. If you're convinced that a troll farm is pumping BB, why wouldn't a troll farm be refuting this post as well? You're not going to get any answer that you can possibly accept without the possibility of it being a shill response.

Sort of, VM had 27% of shares that could be sold at SOME price, held by institutions, with 30% short. 

GME has literally more shares sold short than have ever been offered. 72m short on 69m issued.

Either way, exciting times ahead.
Because the underlying assumption is Cohen's goal is to create a VW squeeze situation and dilute shares/do a buyback/etc. in order to get rid of the shorts so the company can have a chance of growing without being suppressed and at the same time acquire funds to fix any of the lingering issues left by the previous management.
Mr Packinrod...Can you explain to me what's going on with GME and WSB? From what I understand we are buying GME at current price and some cuck is gonna get his shorts wrecked at an absurd price? Can I participate? Will I make money?

She claims its lights started flashing and bells were going off -- all signs that she had hit the jackpot. She even snapped a selfie in front of the screen, which was flashing "printing cash ticket $42,949,672.76." Except, according to the casino, the jackpot was a mistake -- a malfunction in the machine -- and she wasn't going home a newly minted multi-millionaire.

There was some old lady leading the class and she was making a math problem with a comparison to the Buffalo Bills.  The point she was making is it was as ridiculous of a claim (her math problem) as claiming the Buffalo Bills were either in or winning the Superbowl.  I woke up thinking that was funny... the Bills in the Superbowl.

Gap, 4-0!!!!! Minimaal, haller 2x 1x tadic en Klaassen natuurlijk
Because Tesla’s current price target of $1250 assumes they will deliver 5 million cars by 2030. That would justify the $1250 stock price in present day. I think they will do that by 2025. It’s part of the equation for exponential growth.
The military don’t typically like to change vendors especially if the agencies have been using their tech for years. They’ll just keep giving money for upgrades/renewals. Palantir is set for decades with gov’t contracts alone.

For growth, investors just want to see if they are able to scale in the commercial side because that’s where the money is.

Now they’re public, people will know more what they do so I think Palantir is just getting started.

1. The squeeze will only work if people keep buying, if there is no pressure then no squeeze
2. I have faith in Ryan Cohen so I'm long anyway

Its in your brokerage agreement. Just like how when you deposit money in a bank there isn't a physical vault they go to get "your" money. They do whatever they want with your money while they have it, and you agree to it when you sign up for the account.  

How do you think brokerages make money? The same way banks do. By doing shit with your stuff.
No

You make a good point, and the OP might be right, but i’ll play something else then to bet that TSLA will 100% on some sort of zealous cult belief. Even 100% is not that much in this market atm. Sure options are more than 100%, but it’s also more risky, especially given we are again talking about a 1.8T target
No, I understand the challenge clearly. I think you are misunderstanding how prepared these companies already are to tackle these challenges and how much progress they may have already made in doing so without telegraphing it.
Buying BB at 9 is like buying GME when it was 9 a few short months ago

Long story short it's a turnaround hopeful with a bit of short squeeze drama for extra fun  


Longer version:   
They made it through covid intact and a previously successful investor is holding a large chunk of shares. From what I understand based on media reports and chatter, that investor and two of his lieutenants from his previous e-commerce company (Chewy, valued at 40 price to sales) have plans to turn the the company around by focusing on customer delight and online sales. Private equity companies do this all the time - they take an ailing company, restructure the organization, modernize it and focus on growth (although they often fire a lot of people as well and load the company with excessive debt, but that's another story). I'm my view, the rally has been caused by the news of old execs leaving and Cohen and gang entering.

Short term and possibly a reason why the stock has seen a rally, is because of the large short positions and the resulting **short squeeze**. If you check the data, you'll see that shorts have naked shorted the stock (ie. shorting without having borrowed stock). These type of situations can get a little hairy in case of a sudden price increase - shorts can only exit their position by buying stock, further driving up the price. **However, data posted in wsb also shows that shorts have increased their short position, which would actually mean that the short squeeze hasn't even started yet and the rally was due to news about Cohen**. As with everything relating to market microstructure / auction market theory, don't expect to see any educated coverage in the financial media. Is so much simpler to say wsb is pulling the strings, because it's out in the open, rather than buying data from BATS or other exchanges to try and get a feel of who's really driving this.

**Future growth:**

The way I see it, if the plans work out, the company should see a increase in sales which would increase investor interest and lead to an expansion in the price/sales multiple (growth companies have higher P/S, P/B, P/E multiples). However, this is not a 0 to 100 in a month play, the way I see it, it will take years for the plans to work out, if they do. I'm not YOLOing this and I fully expect to see a quieter period after the short squeeze has ended, but I'm in for the longer term. I really like the turnaround story because of the possibility of asymmetrical returns - downside is capped at -100% (if it goes tits up), but the upside is so much bigger.

Don't make decisions based on the herd. Do your own DD, manage your risk and find something else besides reddit to fill your time. That's the only way you have hope for diamond hands.

Chewy won not just because of its e-commerce or any of the tactics you're mentioning. It won because its core strategy was hyper-focusing on a passionate customer bases' needs and experience - all the other stuff helped support meeting these needs. All of the things you listed are getting access to the 'stuff', but completely ignores the experience and interaction. I don't expect GS to mirror the tactics utilized that made Chewy successful, but the strategy of hyper-focusing on a passionate niche customer segment and revitalizing the customer experience is absolutely one that can differentiate them.

PLTR can do exactly what they want in 1/10 of the time and 10x better - they have a massive market to capitalise on.
I’ve been slowly moving my portfolio over to PLTR since Christmas. I think it’s now time to go balls deep 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Maybe they knew people would FOMO in hard after the previous days run up. Maybe funds are trolling WSB now and setting bear traps with pump and dumps. IDK .. all I know is they did it to make money.

edit: the fomo would skyrocket seeing the 25% pre-market pump making people think it was the next GME .. worked on me but i'm holding for as long as it takes.

Don’t listen to people trying to pump shit. Read DD (Due Diligence). Do your own as well. GME is a unique scenario of massive short interest vs a turn around strategy by Ryan Cohen and his Chewy team. Firms were too scared to touch it with a ten foot pole—but we weren’t.

Go back to letting some boomer out your money in ETF’s because you shouldn’t be here if you can’t keep up on current news and stay ahead of the market, I’ve been in GME since $15 a share lol, go fuck yourself while I jerk off and clean up my load with money provided by Melvin’s like yourself.

Fuck you boomer get back to your index funds, cunt
I don't think it will give a fuck, tump got it and nothing happened
You have two options:
1) Buy as much GME as you can.
2) Lurk for a bit, see what gangs have formed (GME, PLTR, BB, TSLA, NIO, etc etc), understand *why* those gangs are buying, and considering buying into one if their reasoning makes sense to you and if your own research leads you to that conclusion.

Lots of meme stocks get thrown around here—you need prudence to discern what’s worthwhile. And don’t fuck with options. Just buy shares.

Edit: My position is 2950 shares of GME (2270 in brokerage, 680 in IRA) @ 30.16 avg after doubling my position on Friday.
I am honored
it would go up. all news makes market go up lol
Okay listen here you little ****, let’s say you buy 10 shares of GME @ whatever price it will be Tuesday morning maybe 40, it doesn’t matter.
You multiply 10 with at least 100, bc that is a reasonable price that GME will have at the Minimum.

10x40 = 400
10x100 = 1000 
-> 600 Profit

I get the concern. And you're absolutely right. I think we have a better chance of this turning into a motley fool or seeking alpha clickbaity type shill factory rather than a legitimate threat from the SEC.

That being said, a major concern has always been the pump and dump schemes, and probably even more of a concern now with Botnets so easily accessible to any dipshit. Prioritization of content with Reddit's system is easy to astro-turf, bumping something until the algorithm shows it organically and actual people jump on it.

The government has been printing a lot of money for a lot longer than a year. Inflation hawks have been wrong every step of the way on this. The reason for this is that the dollar is the international reserve currency, and people flee to dollars during economic crises. Japan printed even more money for even longer, but since the yen is also a major reserve currency, they had problems keeping inflation up to the central bank's target.

You could see some modest inflation if household savings are strong and stimulus checks are going out in 2021. But nothing like the "zomg the monetary base has tripled in however long" folks claim.

To be clear, the loudest voices talking about GME the longest have never been advocating for market manipulation. They have been vocal about the short situation and how it could very well become unmanageable by the short sellers if they over extended their positions, which could result in an upwards correction of the stock price and potential short squeeze. That creates a legitimate profit opportunity. People who are advocating for market manipulation or that this sub somehow runs the markets are also the people who have 20-200 shares in GME calling it a yolo and buy 0DTE lottery options. Perspective.

I’ve been following Tesla for over 6 years. The last risk of bankruptcy was like 4 years ago. Since then, that talk of risk has basically gone away except for maybe some no-name funds.

My retard understanding of it is GME has an insane number of shorts betting against the company so people are buying GME to fuck the shorts and raise the stock price when the shorts give up

I think you’ve got a misunderstanding of how much its going to cost any of these auto makers to switch. 

First: their distribution model is retailers that they have to convince to switch fully to EVs.

Second: they have to change their entire factories (most likely build new ones)

Third: autonomous driving is the key. It will allow Tesla to make a clean profit for nothing on millions of cars.

Reddit would get sued. And moderation would change. Not sure what would happen with the market. I am sure they could get subpoena's to see who made what plays. These people are not dumb (debatable) but they will look at trading history, relationships and build a case. People posting DD is fine. That is not insider trading. Having access to the financials before earnings release would be.

Also people on this very subreddit were entertaining the idea of the $50-$100 put on the forgone conclusion tesla was going to be bankrupt within 1 year. Professionals thought so too, and lost billions on that bet. 

Option price is also partially determined by the open interest and the IV was super low on the upside at the time. I never made a bet either way on Tesla, but I watched it all happen.

I'm talking about having to lay eyes on the comment of someone who can't put their shoes on correctly. It's offensive. Not really talking in context of making money.
lemme take care of that
I'm just curious what the end game really is for GME after you guys are done destroying Melvin.  Seems like there's going to be a lot of bag holding

It isn’t a problem until some retards start explicitly trying to “coordinate an attack” which is as good as admitting a plain market manipulation.

I am referring to some posts of GME in the last few days where some people literally write suggestions to “lets all buy at $x to force the squeeze” - this is obviously illegal but hard to prove...unless you fucking write it explicitly like so!
Well I bought the same ones as OP and they were $2 (pre split) so I don’t know what to tell you. TSLA was around $200 and everyone saying they would go bankrupt. This contract strike was 3.5x the current value at the time. 

Believe it, don’t believe it. Maybe go look at a historical price chart. 🤷‍♂️
Shares?
Just realized that some 1dte hedge puts I bought Thursday were actually itm after close yesterday. I was thinking that they had expired worthless
Bro stop trading you’re going to hurt yourself
One of the more reasonable posts that I have seen on here.  Agreed. Also 🚀🚀🚀
I think the numbers I’ve heard are around 60-100$ being a target

Anyway, idgaf anymore gl
That's true. But with Reddit's group think style of content prioritization in a sub, you can have a bunch of retards latch onto a concept and blow it up real quick. Lemmings like you read about. And honestly it is kind of hard to not fall into.

Whoops. 2021.
Market close monday lol. its martin luther king day
Are we too euphoric?
Mine was 60% rn and if market plunges on Tuesday, my portfolio won't see another day
Oh okay yeah correct. I will prob buy a leap on it.
What if \deepfuckingvalue was ones of the gme board members?
also GME is nobrainer. its a longterm hold stock. so you can put a small part of your portfolio even few hundred bucks and once melvin capital goes belly up or even just has heavy losses and investors start fleeing and their ceo has to sell his 44 mil florida mansion, you can brag "i ruined a billion dollar hedge fund" :P
He had more I think took profits and he mentioned something about how 13F don’t show the whole pictures bc options didn’t show on those
Look at what it did for google
Only rookies that hate money will set it that low.
Other than the falling bit, that actually kinda looks fun

I feel like ICLN forced a lot of ppl to drop it this past week. Which means it'll moon this upcoming week back to 34.50
I actually moved to 3rd st in dec so technically I fucking made it. I still can't believe it. Just in 2018, I lived on Manchester and 94th. I used to see prostitutes on my block every day.

Tesla bull and it’s my largest position, but this is true casino fog mindset.  There’s a lot of future performance priced in already but also not. 

Model S&X refresh with 4680 battery pack, better specs most likely, FSD rollout this quarter. Plaid performance model.  Model Y production ramp.  Double the export rate to Europe. 

Those things will drive the stock higher but Q1 never good for unit sales. S&X lines shutdown for a month or more for upgrading, so no output.  Speed should improve as a result though.

Autonomous vehicles, sure they get a leg up there. But EV tech is an easier adoption than you realize for these companies. To not have plans for this moment would be tantamount to purposefully bankrupting them. 
Where have they been? Resting on their fucking laurels mate. That’s where. Let Tesla take the risk in developing the tech while you rake in profit on gas powered cars.

The reality is that some parts of Africa (e.g Sudan, Mali, Ethiopia) were just as developed as the rest of the world for some time, but other parts were just as "barbaric" as the Vikings, or the Mongols.

The reality is that much of Africa is far too infertile for civilization to develop, so it didn't. The Europeans aren't at fault (not completely), nor are Africans (not always at least), but rather geography.

Civilization in Africa developed wherever it could, and it created Grand Empires (the Nubians conquered Egypt before and Mali was insanely rich), but most of it was just tribal wasteland.

Lumping it all together as one entity called Africa is both disingenuous and damaging, and it can be considered bad history.

There's no administration stockpile of reserves, according to what they told governors yesterday and contrary to what they had previously promised. Pfizer said it does have second vaccine doses available to distribute to people who got the first shot.

Where does this site get its figures from? 

Not only does it list short interest at 68.13 million (a figure from the 15th of December), but the 249.67% float would suggest that there are over only 27.29 million shares left available for purchase. This would be great, except I can't find any other sites to support this. Even the NASDAQ takes over a week to update their statistics (which they do every 2 weeks). Places like MarketBeat, Yahoo Finance and Ortex (which are generally much more reliable) only have figures from the last bi-weekly update (31st of December).

Unless someone can tell me I'm wrong, I'm certain that NOBODY knows what the true float % is. The last figure was 147% on the 31st of December
Maybe they just got another serial killer on the loose? Their prisons are pretty swanky

This is amazing. Well done fellow autist
I was pointing out that there is no way that WSB has that kind of money. I'd wager that 99% of wsb'ers have accounts under $10k and the .01% of us that have more than that make up a collective wealth of less than $250,000,000. 

Can you move a single ticker with that? Sure. Markets? I dont think so.
6/18 is a ways away so youve got time. But i totally see the price faltering a bit further down so you probably overpaid for that...
Do both
Cop shares too, buy it up. It will pump hard
then Monday comes, a big trash truck, and plows the guy into the snow
TL:DR - options are money printers, shares fuel the money printer. Something something rocket takeoff.

When they sell their yachts I’m sure they’ll use the funds to buy a few million in puts on something else, and we’ll take that money too (so long as the DD pumping out of this sub aligns).  Then they’ll have shit credit, switch to food stamps and start looking at cardboard boxes after they sell their rental properties and main home.

Here’s the thing with that, people give too much of a shit about getting downvoted and hate mail to post contradictory stuff.  However that is by far the best way to get quality DD.  I posted how I didn’t see the short squeeze on GME happening and one of the folks who responded outlined pretty much the exact scenario that happened as far as what the triggers would be.  He was off on the when but he damn near nailed the what.  

There is nothing wrong with calling out the risks and the side benefit is you will find a to. If accounts to block when you do it.
Please tell me WSB isn’t going to regress back to it’s weekly calls days. There’s a reason why you don’t see many old users on here. Weeklies killed them all, including me, I’m just a ghost

Guys yesterday seemed weird.. also about SEC Rule 201 if I understood correctly They can only short on an uptick. They first crashed the price down and kept it there all day. Look how it never moved above $36!!! Every time it went up, it got shot back down! They must be continuing to short all day yesterday. If they didn’t do this, they’d be shorting at open price $38-$40. Each up move instantly shot back down this didn’t look normal. Please correct if me I’m wrong I’m retarded

Where were they for the past 20 years when Tesla snuck up on them? They’re not sitting on their hands now. But they’re also 5-6 years away at a minimum and have no autonomous software. Tesla has a billions of road miles analyzed advantage on their next closest competitor in that sector: Google. Which is in the millions. That vast amount of data is almost incomprehensible.

Derek Dack is Chadder than Chad
I’ve seen research in here showing high volumes of Put options placed at like the $16 mark.  So that either means that’s when they bought or that’s the strike price they bought.  If strike, then the only time they’d make any money is when the stock falls under $16 because that’s when they can buy stock to pay back their owed shares.  1/15 was apparently a big expiration date for options, so the put options that expired yesterday will now need  to be fulfilled with the amount of stock they borrowed (thesis being that shorts now have to buy back 70m shares because their puts expired and they can’t buy back cheaper than their initial investment.
Are you okay?
That was not a crash.
Lol still a better outlook than mine

FYI fellow Autist....a CFA is a big fucking deal, perhaps the equivalent of a Doctorate in finance. Dunno how he got it cuz he can't trade worth shit
How so? Say X has 100 shares and sells a covered call to the shorter Y, who shorted 100 shares. The call is deep ITM at expiry and thus gets exercised. Now 100 shares are sold by X to Y at the strike price. How does this create any buying pressure?

More generally, say there are 1000 total outstanding shares of company ABC. Our guy X shorts 1000 shares at $5, banking $5k, and buys 10 calls at strike $10 to hedge. Some, or most, of these calls might have been sold by MMs, who will then buy some fraction (depending on the delta of the calls) of the underlying shares to hedge. There are now 20k oustanding shares floating around, 10k of which are generated by the short positions, and some fraction of the remaining 10k ones are tied to the short call positions. That leaves you with more than 10k shares freely floating around. When the shorters decide they need to close, they exercise they calls, and close all their positions buying back at $10, regardless of the current price. We are back to the initial situation with 10k outstanding shares, and no buying pressure was created to cover.

Is this picture missing something? I'll be happy to be proven wrong.

Granted, I'm not saying this is the current situation. For one, we should have seen a huge number of calls in the OI if they were used to hedge all the short positions, and I don't think we do.
If you don't like 0.5% down days, wait til you hear about 3% corrections.

The spending proposed requires a large amount of treasuries to be auctioned, driving the yields higher. If you look at the ten year treasury the yield rose significantly in anticipation of Biden’s announcement and continued to rise after he surprised with a larger bill than expected.

When treasury yield goes up, you end up making it harder to finance current debt with cheaper debt. This impacts equities because most companies cary debt that is now more “expensive” if you will. 

That’s most likely why equities sold off.
but think of the bright side, you can walk into any store and grab anything under750 bucks and not be charged with a crime.

Got DD to support?
Two BRAND NEW consoles came out this year and GME is down 3.5% on their 4th quarter revenue. 

The argument that they're going to move into a subscription service or the chewy guy will come up with some brilliant plan is ludicrous. There is nothing they can do that isn't already being done.

Subscription? Xbox game pass.

Digital sales? Amazon, walmart, or idk, xbox, playstation and fucking steam?!

Accessories? Amazon

Need them in a pinch? Walmart.

Partly has taken place.
Stop with the fake news. 

1) His screenshot shows that he purchases these supposed calls in Oct 2019. So be bought an option thats over a year our. And then I’m not going to repeat what I said above. You won’t find an option with such a low premium for such a long period for a growth stock like Tesla at these prices of the prices it’s been at over the last 10 years. 

2) Your supposed case is bullshit too for the same reasons. Whether it was back in May or last Oct, 1) there wasn’t a market for the options you claim to have purchased and 2) even if there was, they would never be that cheap. The mathematics around option pricing would never price it that low.
Anyone posting DD should just stop. This entire sub is going in on GME at open.
They have 30% profit margins on their cars. #1 in the industry. And $10k autonomous software they sell on top of that will be pure profit. They are projected to have 1.2 billion software revenue in 2022 alone. I think this new development on their timeline with cars will get that much higher.

Does it trade on the EU stock market, or are you buying it from the US market?  I'm probably wrong but I don't think GME is available except through the US markets so no, you won't be able to.

Short interest is still very high, and honestly with the amount of shares shorted it would need to go higher tbh. I think that was more of a gamma squeeze on Wednesday, not shorts covering.
Same here. Sold some CC for $15 1/22. If I get exercised and the stock flies past $15 I don’t care since I bought in at $11.41 and made a profit. If it don’t get exercised and the stock falls, slowly rises or straight lines, I still made a premium.
I did something similar. I think it will go up up
I do believe there are folks on here trying to manipulate everyone to their benefit. The mods do a good job weeding that out - but posts will slip through.

But for the most part I really believe we care about each other. We celebrate other's victories, offer encouragement and spend a lot of time explaining thoughts and ideas. 

We may not be exchanging Christmas cards, but 90% of people here are all rooting for us ALL to succeed. You just need to do your DD to find that 90%.
Nah dude the SEC rule prevents shorting on an uptick. So they can only short after stock goes up rather than flushing it down with almost instantaneous falls once it reaches algo triggers

now they are, they are poised to finally be allowed to grow, and they will. it wont take much to move the needle.

That doesn’t counter what I’m saying. 

I like Tesla as a company (not crazy about them being a conglomerate, wish they’d split up), but they’re selling cars at a loss if you remove the carbon credits. 

If they can make cars at $25k, that’s awesome. It also means the higher end cars will likely come down too. But it still doesn’t mean they’re making profits on their cars.
Dude I have $11.5C expiring that Friday so I fucking hope so. If I am being honest though, a smarter play would have been super long calls. I may have to reinvest into that.
Got some BAC calls 34.5 exipry of 2/29, expecting to print. Beating earnings combined with stimulus progression should do good.
I don't like how there is a huge dip right before the spike. There are going to be a lot of single ply pussi paper bois letting go. May DFV give us strength when the day comes that we are tested.

I agree but if GME does an offering that is probably just going to encourage ppl who are long term( like me) to increase shares, and will be better for the company long term. Additionally, something like an offering is likely only going to increase short positions, to have a potential squeeze again. Cohen isn’t going to leave his seat. He wouldn’t show this much interest and enthusiasm if he didn’t  truly believe in the potential. An sec filing for the negitive is something that we can’t really predict right now 

All in all, I am holding even if I loose money short term Ans bears win. Overarching theme is that this stock is so overly shorted and resistance right now is completely synthetic. If gamestop continues positive news, then the shorts are going to get crushed, and the upside seems more lucrative than any regular bullish stock position. For that reason alone, I’m not letting go of my shares until I make a profit. I already sold and gathered some of my profits while leaving some shares in just in case of a boom does happens So I didn’t miss it. If that little drops by a 50% on Tuesday, so be it. I’ll make it up by buying more shares and holding at a fair price

I was in this compony at 11 dollars before I even knew what this thread was. I decided to get on since every other post seems to be about GME
36 shares, 2 9c 1/22 and 2 9.5c 1/22 locked and loaded!!!

This makes no sense lol. An organization wants people to buy shares. More investors = higher stock price = they make money

Thanks for the intelligent and prudent post. I think there’s a lot of good advice here and I greatly appreciate and thank everyone who offers it. Some rowdiness and fervor is also an essential element of this sub, but I agree that toning it down a little would benefit us all and help keep a great thing going.
I’m an Army officer and I love it. If you’re the kind of person that wants to work for a “bigger picture” rather than just a regular job and you need structure, by all means do it. Once you serve past your initial 3 years you’ll get the GI bill which covers 3 years of your masters.

Don’t listen to everyone bashing the military, it’s a great option if you don’t really know what you want to do yet.

At this point, with Cohen and the Chwy gang on board, the “what if” part of the thesis has proven to be true. Making money on this has never been easier 

1. Buy in
2. Block out all bearshit 
3. Enjoy crazy profits by June/July or earlier 

Cohen made this price jump happen just by joining the board. What happens when he releases his plan? What happens when Cohen and the boys buy up their allotment of shares? What happens when shorts actually start to cover?

Bears come out in full force every weekend saying the crash is here. Ignore the noise. My belief is Friday had pullback because they aren't sure what to make of this new tax plan Biden mentioned. NIO got hit harder because of the former Co founder is now at another EV company but it'll bounce back. 

GME only being down 10% after a 100% run on a day like yesterday of all days is pretty damn bullish imo.
Puts on Wells Fargo?

Short interest would be less
Prob cuz they want to protect people from buyingbat way higher or lower prices than the price really is. You prob are not able to sell at more than a 25% loss or smth like that. I know it was more complicated than that but it was something like that last time I checked why mine did it
Every bubble is uncharted that's why they are so hard to predict. That being said, being early is the same as being wrong.

what data are you referred to when you say shorts havent even began to cover
My advice is buy before you see the good memes and sell when youve seen about ten of them.
Which one you guys prefer to use: Swaggy or WSB Synth?
I also tried to read it. If only I could read.

Also want to go to grad school in the future and getting out with no loans would be a blessing. I hate having debt hanging over my head
I’m holding all the way to the top because I have a lower amount of capital
But surely this will help GME revenue? And at very least up the stock value preventing the shorts?
I’ve had quite a few of these lottery tickets. Usually sold for 100% gain only to see them go up 1000%. This guy had bigger balls (or worse risk management) and the appreciation was straight lunacy. I agree - most of us wouldn’t have held for the entire ride
I know of a few on here, which, when combined will probably equate to a decent %
“Exponential growth” - Cathie Wood 

This will put Tesla solidly years ahead of any other car company. It’s their Apple moment like they had with the iPhone. It’s going to get people in their ecosystem & it will be game over. Autonomous driving is safer than any other way to drive a car. That alone is huge.
How do we know that the short squeeze has not yet taken place in the last few days you could already see a high increase
Oh man, check out some of the DD posts in here going back 6 months.  GameStop is about change for the better, bigly.
Now apply inflation.
I think this one might be a buy the news type of event given the recent days. I didn't want to hold over the weekend but I might just get a 2/5 120-125c spread.
Also a good choice. I own 5k shares of EPD, which is the premier company in that ETF

I think, me as a eurpean can trade GME on monday right? does somebody know?
Call me old fashioned but I can't see how people can get on board with drinking their THC.
Why is this sub bothering with BB and other shit right now. GME has unlimited squeeze potential. The one time where we can all benefit by buying GME and people are trying to chase other things smh.
I did some DD too. This redditor has been around for 4 years so he ain't an overnight pump scheme fuckit I'm in
Sauce please?
You already know

TLDR version: To the kids reading this, yes you are the all powerful sex god that can manipulate markets and one year on this subreddit will allow you to buy a Lambo 20% of the time all the time! 

Keep at it champs!
What do you think the price will look like next week? And what is your long term price target?


Thanks for your insight

Everyone just put 69,420
That’s a valid point that it should be priced in to some degree but I’d still expect some change
That would make it a $1.8T company. 

Not saying you’re right or wrong, but there’s only one company that’s there. And they have a lot more profit.
Point on the 1W chart where BB hurt you. 

Sounds like you were on the wrong side of that run up, better luck next time.

The guys that were pumping BB 30+ days ago definitely sold Jan 15. 

But hey, maybe there will be another pump and dump that you can profit off. Lots of people do...
It’s horrible because I’m still losing money
Honestly idc I'll be watching gme all next week, I'm prob holding my bb and buying more for 6 months min. I think we could see it by eom but I wouldn't expect any huge moves for a few more months.
One question tho: Is the 1.8 members enough to actually pump a stock in this huge market? Just curious as to how much effect we have in the market . Thank you

It's not that they bought into GameStop or own revenue of GameStop it's just that they have a profit sharing program through their digital sales so anytime anyone buy something on the Xbox store GameStop gets a piece of that

I bought the same options as the OP, so you’re wrong. I paid $2 per $690C in May 2019. OP got them a bit cheaper. There was a 5:1 split so then I got 5 contracts at $138 for each $690 I owned. $2 / 5 = 40 cents.

Short version: mutations in covid strains may render antibodies produced after vaccination ineffective, virus can still enter human cells and cause disease.

Long version:
RBD = receptor binding domain, in other words the part of the COVID-19 spike protein (against which vaccines have been created) that binds to the ACE2 receptor on human cells, the way the virus enters.
Amino acids have letter codes, the number stands for the position in the protein that's changing in those mutations (e.g. A XXX B). Consequently, the RBD protein changes in shape, if there's a new spot that the virus can bind to human cells with that the antibodies produced by the vaccine don't block, it can still bind and enter human cells, replicate and cause disease.
Vaccines will need to be changed to include this variant to be effective again. Now there's a possibility that current vaccines offer some protection still, and/or decrease the severity of the disease course for these new variants. That's something that will have to be seen.
Also worth pointing out that it could have basically taken a bit fat dump and he would have been out of pocket.  You win some, you lose some. We don’t talk about losses.
Hey can you help me out, What does "less than 10% of the call holders are actually exercising." Mean?

They have conviction i guess. If you truly believe its going to zero(i dont know why you would), wouldnt you love these highs to ride down to zero? Borrow rates seem high though so im not 100% sure
Porsche announced they had a 74% ownership of voting shares the Sunday evening before the VW spike; GME is a completely different situation in which no hostile takeover is present, and the problems for GME long term still very much exist. I think it pops to 45-50 then settles around $25-30 after all is said and done.
Calls on ARKQ - >!the robots win!<
Or you know, read some DD, and make triple your dad’s income? See, everyone can say shit.

Ohh he doesn’t like being called that
No, you aren’t getting me.

YOU CAN GROW MORE THAN ONE PLANT AT ONCE

what you’re saying is they grow one plant, see if it’s what they want and if it isn’t they try again.

That isn’t how companies cross breed anymore.

They will take hundreds of differently bred plants all at once, grow them all, then test them for the quality they want. It doesn’t take nearly as long as what you’re saying.

Plus, what if they can’t even do it
> to pump some calls you have **on a dieing \[dying\] company** so you can make tendies while they're left holding the bags. 

The company is in transition. If it does die it won't be for some years now at least.
OoOoOoOo somebody got up on the wrong side of bed.
Yeah, it gets pumped and then “dumped” onto the shorts, not tards like you, at 100x the current price as they rush to cover. This is punishment for being fucking retarded and continuing to short 140% of the float when it was obvious the company wasn’t going bankrupt. They had a chance to get out.
If you don’t understand how you can make money by hearing this, if retards would just hold their fucking shares and set a limit sell, even at $40 you’ll make a profit when shorts start covering.

That's pretty much every post on this sub, get with the program!
Dude I wish
I’m with you. Got 2/19 100c. Even if it doesn’t squeeze it’s been yoyoing and looks like it’s on the upswing right now.

I’m going to swing trade this rather than look for a squeeze though. If it moves to $100 in the next two weeks I’m taking profits and might buy puts. 

If I see volume tick up I’m going to assume it’s because WSB is flooding it and I’m going all in with calls for a week or two lol. Average volume is < 500k
If you’re graduating college (With Bachelors degree) and choosing military make sure you go officer route no matter what. Look at which military branch gives you best career progression. (You can also get the military to pay for masters degree through an ROTC program) Army vs marines vs navy vs air force. See what job/branch has best civilian job application. Love our combat arms troops but realistically does not translate well to civilian careers. Don’t let the recruiter dictate your career. Understand what your goals are in life and how can the military help/hurt those goals. Lastly, understand difference between active duty, reserve, or national guard. Most not in MIL wont understand but I love my military experience and wouldn’t trade it... but a lot of my training translated into the civilian sector and met a lot of really interesting people in the military... and sometimes its about who you know not what you know.
Woah what a scum

I own 7 shares, and I'm gonna hold them until I make $200 on them.
I've been bearish on PLTR from day one. Memers convinced themselves a boomer stock was the next tesla. This is a government contracts company, boring. I am sure the company will continue to increase in value but at boomer speeds.
Buying GME shares is a very high reward to risk ratio play. Yes, there’s a chance GME can crash. But $20 is a strong support level, and if it goes even below that, Cohen loaded at $16. $16 is the absolute floor IMO. Even if you bought in at $35, you would lose only a little over 50% if it dropped to $16.

Hell we’ve all lost 50% in minutes easy on fd’s. Just treat this like a long term options play with no expiration date, and enjoy the ride

I think APHA still has a ways to go. Wait for more announcements from new admin before selling.
I’m sort of in the medical field, Army seems to offer some good career paths in the field I’m interested in. I’m a very “keep your head down” kind of person so it won’t be an issue. When I do a job I do it well and don’t like to cause problems. Since I’m getting my bachelors I probably won’t be going infantry
do you think it'll get over 12 by the end of next week?
Ideally, you want to enter positions when stocks and options have low volatility, but where the company is demonstrating new growth and leadership in an emerging market. This is the exact case with Nokia.

If the company was stagnant, and operated as "business as usual", I would agree with you.
You could be just holding the bags, or you could jerk off into the bags and sell them to Melvin at 10x value

I’m playing both. I really like BAC, not just a value play. It’s so far ahead of other banks on tech and it’s strong in every segment. 

I’ve got $30c for 4/21, 6/21, and 1/22, and $35c for 1/22. Been holding those for a month or so and am up between 1x and 2x on those. I added $2k worth of WFC 1/22 $40c on Friday. Might add the same for BAC after earnings or more WFC.
Thanks for the opinion 🌈🐻 here’s mine. Cohen is a catalyst and your Puts won’t even be worth a penny.
I went in both because of uncertainty. If options, I'd go for LEAPs here (why I bought a fuck ton of Jan '22 calls), since lockup expy inevitably is gonna produce uncertainty for price.. Why not a healthy mix of both?
The fact is I'm right you are wrong

I know. But the point is that you’ll never find LEAPS that are priced that cheap for a volatile stock like Tesla that’s a year out. Even back then, leaps were not being sold for cheap because no person in their right mind would be on the other side of this trade. 

Every option you buy needs a seller on the other end. 

Go ahead and look through other stocks and see if you can find leaps that are under a dollar. The price of an option is proportional to its likelihood. The only way you can find an option this cheap is something that’s expiring the same day and has like a .01% chance of happening.
I couldn't bring myself to lock in all my other losses. Just sold my gainz for hopefully more gainz. I think I might actually be retarded.

At what point does it cross into market manipulation though? Any retard can make 1000 posts anywhere telling you to buy a stock because they think it’s a good investment.
Cramer's tweet came at around 6a. I see GME trading at 20.43 at 9:30a and 31.45 at 4p.

Nothing that I see in the short data for those days indicates any significant squeeze.

And make no mistake, this is Cramerica, we're just living in it.
LEAPs
Doesn't matter if they need the cash, they're a company that announced a plan to offer more shares within the last 3 months and their stock just skyrocketed, I wonder what the best business decision is? Probably to maximize profits for members of an internet gambling community that is holding shares purely to make a play off of other investors betting the company will fail.
is the situation with game stop even similair to previous short squeezes? I read up on what happened with VW and at the time porche SE owned 74% of shares and the german gov. owned 20% and both were completely unwilling to sell leaving only 6% on the open market, thus when buy outs started shares ran out quickly. Are there similair massive stakeholders of GME?
Damnit... not supported on RH. My plays are APHA and TLRY long term because even after the merge they are already working with Anheuser Busch which gives them global distribution in the  CBD/THC beverage market.

I care about you.
I'm waiting for the drop to sell most of it. With the Volkswagen infinity squeeze, you got more money selling it after the initial spike then you did selling it before. And the timing was much easier.

>Months leading up to MOASS, stock price doubled and there was a big dip the Friday before the MOASS ( € 65 Euro drop).

>Monday - At start of trading day jumps to € 348, up 66% from Friday close b/c of weekend press release by Porsche. Closes the day up 149%.

>Tuesday - Starts lower than Monday close but then goes up. During day it hits the high point at € 1K . It closed at € 945 that Tuesday.

>Wednesday - Porsche jumps in and offers shares to help the shorts. And price starts going down.

>Friday - Closed at € 495.

SEC can’t go shit lol 😂
And the haters say you can't time the market 😏
If it’s really a good company keep buying, cheaper prices are good. I was buying JWN for months last year bc it kept going down, and when it popped I wound up with over %150 returns, still holding.
I’m not saying it’s not a sound investment; I’m merely saying I have... shaken faith in anyone that is trying to profit while being subject to communism. 

You could still do well. I wouldn’t sell because redditors have mixed feelings, but I would definitely tread lightly on a culture and ideology I have a small understanding about.
Do some fucking work and look up how to value a company. Add in your price target of $1000 and tell me if it gets there.

It should not be anywhere near that fast. The VW squeeze rose for about 6 days, then dropped back down over a 2-3 day period. This may act a bit quicker but will definitely not happen all in one trading day.
What is considered near, medium and long term for you
Thanks, I actually just wanted to ride GME in hopes of some profits (even though I can't really imagine it will be this much) because I lost a bunch on other trades outside wsb...thats why I am asking myself when the best time to jump off is and whether any effect of the short squeeze will be noticeable in the EU market on monday  
On the other hand, I do believe BB can go a long way! Still I hope GME helps me eliminate my losses

Nobody knows, but my outlook is bullish long term so worth investing even disregarding the potential short squeeze. Even if it doesn’t happen Tuesday or next week, it very likely can happen again...and again...and again until bulls realize that this isn’t a brick and mortar store.

I'm pleasantly surprised to see the growing attention Nokia is receiving. I didn't expect it to hit r/wallstreetbets this soon. When I speculate for large returns, I try to find companies like this that have high value risk/reward. 

Positions,
1. 200x 19 Feb 2021 $6C
2. 200x 21 Jan 2022 $4C

So, why is NOK an interesting risk/reward play? I'll list a few reasons in general terms, unless specifics are requested.

1. *Recent sentiment shift*:  Nokia has shown improved quarterly earnings, and secured several major 5G deployments. As a result, we're seeing more news, publications and analysis that reflect a bullish outlook.

2. *Undervaluation*: Nokia trades at a lower forward earnings compared to its competitors, such as Erickson and Cisco. While Erickson has risen over 35% during 2020, Nokia has remained flat. I believe this will soon change as Nokia gains recognition for its recent growth and partnerships. 

3. *Partnerships*: Quite recently, Nokia announced new and expanded partnerships with Google, for cloud-native network functions, T-Mobile, for a five year 5G network rollout, DTAC for 5G services throughout Thailand, a sole supplier deal for Taiwan Mobile's 5G network, and over [60 additional deals](https://www.nokia.com/about-us/news/releases/2020/01/09/nokia-highlights-momentum-with-63-commercial-5g-deals/) with companies such as AT&T, Sprint, Verizon, Vodafone, Softbank, and others. 

4. *Leadership*: Appointed less than a year ago, Nokia is now operating under Pekka Lundmark, who serves as president and CEO. The old and rotten days of Rajeev Suri are over. One of the main reasons they appointed Lundmark was to drive shareholder value. 

5. *Early Stage*: While sentiment is growing and new deals are being minted, Nokia has yet to reemerge into the top tier investment news cycle. This is important because it's an indicator that you're entering into a position before hype is occurring. 

6. *Premium Cost/Secure Floor*: The premium cost for options, including LEAPS is cheap enough to make this worth a risk/reward play. While you could doubt the growth potential, Nokia operates a strong and growing business that provides a secure floor for share price. Thus, I don't have any concern of my options dumping due to a large drop in the underlying. You will pay around an 8% premium/share ratio for options, which is obviously higher than your bluechip stocks, which are around 4-5%, but this is because the value proposition is so high. 

Why do I have leaps and monthlies? The leaps are self-explanatory. The monthlies are so cheap, that I'm willing to front the cost incase Nokia gains traction sooner than later, which it appears to be doing. 

TL:DR; NOK 200x 19 Feb 2021 $6C 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Bullish for GME in the short term or long term? 


I’m trying to understand what position you’re taking if you think people who wait out this week for the squeeze will be bag holding but you’re also bullish on the company.
This was 2019.
This is too good. Too real. I am us now. Yesterday before opening bell I fomo yolo'd full Autist mode and maxed out my margins on all 3 big meme stonks, lost 3.5k buying high by day's end.  💎🙌 🚀🚀🚀  
edit: fomo 🚀🚀🚀
If a company has average or bad products or services, it’s only a matter of time before their customers realize and churn. Any investment should have some fundamental confidence in the product/service being sold. I do not. 

My mistake in saying your DD is flawed. Misspoke. But I’m firm that the company’s projected vision is flawed.

There’s already legal precedent for this with slot machines. If it’s broken and you keep winning then you’re not at fault for anything. You’re only liable if you tamper with machine or system. If you just use it, and happen to exploit a glitch, then that’s the system owners fault.

I did a bit in the army. Don't make my mistake. If you choose to go this route (desperation only real reason, maybe youre one of those love of country ones) Sign up for a trade that will give you an actual usable skillset, then get out after contract.
Once again, you're not getting it. Cross breeding once doesn't get you the results that XXII is getting. You would have to cross breed over and over and over and over.

I dunno, I like the trend of people donating to their local food banks or shelters more. Local centers are really hurting now, and inculcating an ethic of people donating a pittance of their incredible trendies to something local would spread the love directly to people who need it. But as a theological ethics PhD candidate studying virtue ethics (how the fuck did I end up here), I’m all for anything that encourages a generous spirit.
like the mainstream analysts on mainstream media that manipulate markets?
What’s up with the faint 1 next to 10000.
The shorts need to get back in reality bc we forced them to retard. The two are connected, you are truely retarded if you think that it doesnt matter WSB owns  10% of the fk stock.
Isn't buying a call just allowing him to buy it for that price tho, meaning he hopes it will actually be higher than his call price? He's betting on the side of the stock, a put would be betting against it? That's what I always thought.
Couple of questions.  When can we expect this to blow?

I hold 50 shares and hoping to acquire more Tuesday but  Is it worth it to buy calls to hopefully maximize profits?  I know calls don’t do anything to hold shares from the shorts but will calls be profitable and if so, what strike price and expiry?

Am I retarded?
Only stockholders determine what a fair valuation is. Short selling requires stockholder participation to loan the shares. If longs don’t sell the price can’t fall. 

Price falls when WSB loses their conviction, which is why so many people get irritated with the concern trolls

Not only that but once it becomes posted on a public domain such as reddit, quite literally, it no longer becomes insider information.

 So even if I had information like "Hey guys, my dad owns walmart and he said that they're buying out gamestop for 50$ a share" then posted it on this reddit, then immediately hit my buy order, nothing illegal was committed.  At all.  

Because every human on the planet has access to this information now.  Its no different than bloomberg news being the #1 financial news source and you having to pay for it to get the early scoop on their terminals and all that.  

Now, if i made a trade on that info, then told aboit 100 others in DM's then made a post its insider info.  

At best, we would be shut down for pump and dump schemes but even then thats not the case its not coordinated.  I make a post and whether you do it is up to you.

Fuck you we are fighting Melvin. This isnt about money it is about power.
There is nicotine just very little. Enough to satisfy cravings and withdrawals but not enough to sustain addiction. Other companies have "alternative" cigarettes but these don't go through any sort of regulatory process with the FDA because its not actually tobacco. See TaaT. 

I don't think you understand VLN as a product or you wouldn't be asking about adding flavoring or filters. 

If there's hundreds of strains why are they still breeding new strains? You know there's over 100 cannabinoids in the plant and we have focused on like 2-3 of them. How do you know there aren't other relatively unknown cannabinoids with huge potential benefits that we just don't know about yet. XXII could be the leader in creating proprietary strains with alternative cannabinoids. 

Vaping isnt even deemed safe, hence why all of the vape shops have closed down.

Tesla positions looking kinda shaken up this past week but god and Elon willing we’ll see the earnings run up in full swing come Tuesday or Wednesday. It bounced off of sub 820s a few times and refused to go any lower. Last time it instantly shot up to 845 and then tested 860 breaking it briefly. If you’re in Tesla this week god speed and good luck. We’re in this together
He’s not wrong at all, big institutions move the market, we just got in on this rocket before the big institutions did
Ahhh, so now the wild swing trades begin! As people using margin to buy shares are forced to sell as big dawgs watch for shares out on loan :) Sink it to push margin requirements, forces selling then people buy back in. This is how great swing trades are made.

PLTR has a much higher market cap and is much more difficult for retards on this forum to move than GME. I'm still bullish on it, but don't expect a 60% day. BB is much more synonymous with GME for retard value investors.

Been scratching my little autismo head about this for a while. All of this was public info and the fact that RC increased his stake should have been a major catalyst, and then him getting on the board should have sent us to jupiter (in my opinion). I'm just amazed they haven't covered yet and I have no idea how they weren't made to. 



I thought the squeeze had squozen by Friday so I closed, was pissed to hear the shorts haven't covered yet. I'm yoloing back in Tuesday at open with the gains I made from $17.


I just can't see how the math doesn't work out in our favour here, I guess the shorts really are just retarded.

That is mostly what the stock market is anyways. Price Targets from Wall Street banks seem to have less research and numbers behind them than some r/wallstreetbets DD posts.

The whole market is a giant manipulation that you are either on the "winning" side or the "losing" side and those sides can change in less than a 24 hour period.
You are missing out.
Lol that’s my number 1 point because that’s what they announced. Then I go on to mention what you’re mentioning. They are years behind on making software for cars that won’t exist until 5-10 years from now. Good luck. By then the market will be dominated by Tesla.
What clean energy ETF are we buying???
Why don't you stop being a jealous hater and stfu. Probably a jealous undercover boomer.
Yes, we will see in 7 days. It’s been a rough week. Down 70% overall (rode my ICLN calls all the way up and then all the way down), made some other bad moves, and now I’m down another 70% on my PLTR calls. I’ve got quite the hole to dig myself out of, but I know I’m not the only one. We all have our good weeks and bad weeks on the market.
Don't trust the recruiter they usually aren't there to help you get what you want.. Get everything in writing especially your MO. Verbal agreements don't mean shit.
Bruh I might just be retarded but can you do that on Robinhood?
I think the biggest problem/risk is that people don’t hold long enough and the squeeze doesn’t go through, or that Melvin is able to withstand the squeeze from happening. Offering can happen, but is it likely? Do they need the cash? How’s their debt atm? Don’t have access to see myself rn
Do we know how many shares the employees hold?
Have you read any DD in the past month bro? Apparently not...
When I first joined this, all I saw were post of people trying to get rich quick on a daily spike, some were successful and ended up getting insane increases followed by huge losses, that shit is just volatile, looking for more post of company stocks to invest the long term, boost a company we believe in and get some profits along the way.

This is where I’m at. This is no different than an analyst saying something about a stock or upgrading, downgrading or changing a price target. This sub just happens to use emojis, and memes to massive effect rather than a press release.

AS WSb gets more attention from guys like Jim Cramer the quant funds are going to start tasting blood. WSB advertises every position by nature so front running them will be easy enough. 

I think we will see more and more bear traps on meme stocks. Don't give in to fear and greed and it will be less effective. 

I am also a bit cynical so could be my own bias talking.

I don’t think people realize how proficient RC is at digital. Dude was building sites at 13 and already printing thousands of $$$ a month at 15. He isn’t some boomer on a board, he knows e-commerce inside and out, that’s what you want out of a visionary you’re trusting with your money.

And then he crushed a pet industry in which he had no prior experience. RC + digital gaming is a 🚀🚀🚀 investment whether the squeeze happens or not (it will). https://www.cnbc.com/2020/08/04/chewy-co-founder-ryan-cohen-this-is-the-side-hustle-id-start-now.html

I miss the 2014-15 days when our biggest drama was a fucking Canadian furry faking his $100k Apple yolo on a livestream and writing a book about it. That and Martin Shkreli existing. 

Now we have users with 7 figure robinhood accounts pumping and dumping daily, fights with federal regulators and brokers, and more eyes on us than even Jim Cramer sometimes.
One of the central points in the short squeeze thesis is that there are a relatively small, finite amount of shares that are being actively traded.  Every additional share that gets bought up strengthens the long position even further.

This effect, and the anticipation of it, could have driven extremely heavy volume, considering Cramer's reach (and people's expectations of this news propagating throughout the financial world).
Unless someone actually provides proof, any "I have x shares" is bs. I can say I have 50k shares right now.
Shhh...that is how I keep imagining the story went, don’t ruin it
Feel like it might retrace a bit more, but I've got an eye on it with some cash on hand.

If you're in shares there is no reason to dump if this becomes volatile. Their future scalability looks really strong. Can't have paper hands on this one as this is trading exceptionally lower than future potential

60%+ of the EV market, can you not read?? Why do they need TSLA when they have all of their competitors on board. BB has partnerships with AMZN, NVDA (NIO), BIDU who guess what? Just announced EV company. Hyundai who guess what? Are now in talks with AAPL to build and EV. Sony who guess what? Just announced the launch of their EV. They provide top level cybersecurity and software. Stop going around spreading retarded information you know nothing about obviously. It has nothing to do with cell phones and if you think that then you are on another level or retardation

Ok, if they don’t want nicotine in the cigarettes, why would they still put tobacco in the cigarettes, why wouldn’t they add some other filter and flavor it, that’s such dumb ass logic in my mind.


No one has to cross breed any new species of weed there’s literally hundreds of strains for everything you might need already.

Vaping exists too, buy juice with lower nicotine levels until you can quit. They literally found the dumbest/hardest solution to a simple problem

Encouraging a WSB "mental" consolidation of GME euphoria and stepping back to assess the "what COULD go wrong" with the short squeeze thesis.  This is not a bear-inspired naysayer circle jerk,  but just a responsible (calm yourselves, autists) brainstorm to stay somewhat grounded for the following days/weeks/months.  Afterall, no one saw a pandemic or insurrection coming either.  So, how COULD this go tits up?

* GME does an offering
* Cohen / Melvin architect a backchannel deal to exit their position (is this possible?)
* SEC intervention of some sort

What else could jeopardize this?

Its not.  It stays on the commercial banks' balance sheets as reserve balances.

[https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TOTRESNS](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/TOTRESNS)

They keep such high reserves because they earn 0.1% interest (paid for by US taxpayers) AND because they need to balance out savings deposits which are also ATH

I never said you close business lol i know you dont have that power lol
Yes it is, almost entirely bc of the account opening scandal and fed consent orders which have constrained growth and forced the CEO out. 

I’m not trying to buy the best performing bank though (JPM), I want to buy the beaten down turd (still churned out $3B in profit last quarter) that I know will explode once a definable event occurs. WFC is a retail banking powerhouse and with the consent order listed it will rise closer to book value. I don’t even need it to outperform its peers for this position to work.

Tesla was a start up once.
Circuit breakers are more or less turning things off and on again. Trading will be halted on GME for a certain amount of time. It gives people a chance to take a breath and reorganize.  Then trading starts again. GME had trading halted for about 20 minutes when the Revenue share deal with Microsoft was announced and the stock skyrocketed after.
If I manage to break even from my previous losses I'm sending money some way to the homeless folks in my area. My trades haven't been going well though so my hope isn't very high.

I think there will be swings over the upcoming weeks before the actual squeeze happens but when it does, it will shoot up fast

You sell on the way up. The idea is that the shorts are buying, not fomoers. So it’s not a pump and dump. It’s a pump and sell to shorts at 100x the price as punishment for being a fucking retard and not dropping their position when it got to $13 when it was obvious that GME wasn’t going bankrupt.
It’ll drop and probably consolidate to $30s.
Great response thx Dutch bro

Typically, developing hemp/cannabis plants with new cannabinoid or terpene profiles could take 10 to 20 years using traditional breeding methods. Now, with the combined technologies and know-how of 22nd Century and KeyGene, we expect to shorten the development timeline to create new, differentiated, hemp/cannabis plant lines in just 4 to 5 years. Doing so will provide the Company and its potential licensees and customers with significant competitive advantage as hemp/cannabis continues to penetrate the life science, consumer product, and pharmaceutical markets.”

> Any decent defense attorney would say "they just used your service as it was designed and intended"

I would disagree on this. That isn’t how it was intended. It was an error in their design, hence why they banned all the accounts that exploited the design flaw.

> If anything, probably those account holders had to pay back any and all money earned

Agree with this, but I’d take it further. They’d have to pay back losses too. If someone were to accidentally transfer a million dollars into your bank account, by virtue of incorrectly writing down the account number, that money is not yours to spend. Once the error is discovered, you’re liable to pay the money back. If you’ve spent the money, you’re on the hook for it and you can have criminal charges brought against you.

June $15c here. Bought 48 contracts early Friday morning at $3 each. They rocketed up from opening. But I got faked out and by EOD they were fucking $1.93 per contract. I'm still confident they'll print, but that could end up being a $50k or more difference when I decide to take profits.

Yeah, not much point in selling. And the last time I paperhanded calls at pennies, I lost big time. Sold GME 1/15 30c I paid $0.11 for at $0.14 and minutes later watched it skyrocket to $11.00+. Also sold 1/15 BB calls for like $.24 and missed out on the rally. So I’ve learned my lesson about selling out early.

So PLTR to the moon I guess 🚀😭🚀😭🚀😭🚀

Stop calling it a brick and mortar store you fucking troll, an entire transformation doesn’t happen overnight, Cohen is inevitably going to be fully in control and they will not be a brick and mortar for long

So because you don’t like the products then the growth forecast is flawed? The best way of comparing this company at this point is through metrics of comparison. Revenue forecast is what the company itself has proposed.
I mean at this price I would but I'm a stranger on the internet and have been in since $12. I think even if the $42 we saw last week is the ceiling next week (it prob isn't) you're looking at +$6/share over the price right now

Good DD but I don't know. With the CC's I've been selling I've reduced my cost basis to around $15.70 on 5,500 shares. I'd like to see this thing at least touch all time highs again before I decide to sell out. I believe in the company but this is off to a rough start with wallstreets vendetta against it. Lots of other great plays happening around me but my money has been tied up in sideways action now for months. We'll see what happens after lockup before I decide how long I'm going to hold.

Are Shares or leaps the play here?
RIP whichever WSBer sold you those options thinking “no way Tesla can go up that high, this is literally free money”
That’s correct, there is no estimate.

It’s also not guaranteed, there are a few ways for them to prevent a squeeze.
But I’m to dumb to explain how, there are some threads on it somewhere
Say a company has 100 shares.

25 is owned by board members like Cohen in GME's case, who can't sell. So 75 is owned by retail investors like us - that's the amount of "float", or shares that are available for trade.

If it's shorted to 200% float means short sellers "borrowed" 75×2 = 150 shares. To cover their shorts they literally have to buy 150 shares to return to the brokers they borrowed from.
I read elsewhere one can see the list of orders if you have level 2 access. Maybe someone with access can check and see how many $420.69 orders are currently set and post us a screenshot? Mine are set there now. LFG!!
Lol at your sad little superiority complex
You'll see the stock price freeze... typically for 5 minutes
Did I buy the dip or crash? Will my aapl 135s expiring February print or imma be in the streets?

Well, considering 2/3 of adult smokers want to quit, 50% of them attempting and less than 10% succeeding, I imagine a product that can help you cut back and increase quit attempts would be enticing for them. 

Cross breeding isn't going to get you accurate levels of specific cannabinoids like xxii's technology can. It also is more labor intensive and to achieve these results XXII is getting would take 3-4 times as long. Talking 10 years or so to get a proprietary plant line.

Thank you for your service. BB buyers beware
How long was VW at it's peek when shorted so we have an idea of how much time we have to sell before the dip?
Exactly so buy a position
And government... As seen in recent US politics.
Yes, letting it sit in a bank account is not smart. Make a retirement account like a Roth IRA and you can put a few grand a year into the market and take it out tax-free later in life.
If you're concerned, sell half. As a long time autist here in retard world, I can say that whenever I see all the monkeys in such agreement about the direction of something, they're wrong.

Stop. Buying. GME. Options. How hard is this to understand?  Options anywhere else is fine but share with GME
I might need 99% more explanation to be able to join this discussion
Shit I can barely control my pre-jack
Well said... given retail is now almost 20 percent of the market there is an enormous long run opportunity to change the trading/investing game forever... but it will never happen if the goal is solely pump and dumb... anyone who has traded long enough knows how the movie ends

1. Gaming is a huge market and with the right moves game stop can capitalize on it. Either they will become their own dominate presence or build up enough to be bought out a company like Amazon.   

2. Cohen has proved to know what he is doing. We don't know what the plan is but we can be sure he has one. 

3. In the age of online retail being further pushed by covid it's much easier to transition to online retail, cutting down on building cost and staff cost.
😬
so just pretend to be autistic and hope for the best?
Food service business. Restaurants are strained by covid restrictions and missing their normal volume, and trying to starve off closing up shop permanently. With the advent of food/grocery delivery services providing alternatives to eating out (powered primarily by major tech companies), it's changing market behavior. I'm not saying eating out won't come back post pandemic, but acknowledging alternative services will eat into the market share in the long term.

>and I’ll argue that a lot of the struggle is really poor business decisions

Ignores the complexities of operating in a year long pandemic. Things are far from business as usual.
it's kinda fucked up that anyone can use another mans picture and say all kinds of wild stuff. I love the webs

You’re a snake oil sales man, giving the data right to the firms. It’s a good thing you’re ensuring they’re able to see this data and know exactly how many shares we collectively hold.
There needs to be a karma and age thresh-hold for posts during this time.  There's been a ton of these posts lately.

While that's right, it doesn't bloom like a good profit option as you don't know when it'll come down and to what degree. Positions or ban?

how? if people just buy shares, which leaves the shorters unable to settle their contracts rebuying shares what can SEC do?

Honestly this is what I should do too. PLTR is going to go up, no one knows when so playing weeklies are fucking dumb. But it will go up no doubt
How can one know by what day do they have to rebuy? And at what price point did they buy and how much they expected it to fall?

If you want a higher concentration than that you can buy concentrates and edibles. They’re going to use some wack as chemical to control thc content instead of just growing a different strain no one will buy their weed
Probably because 25% in a day is usually considered pie in the sky thinking 😂

It depends if someone is coordinating the sharing of positive DD in an attempt to pump up a stock (that they own, or someone paying them owns) and then dump it when it rises.

If pump & dump happens and has been prosecuted by spreading positive DD, is there any reason to believe that someone would avoid a large audience of people interested in investing?

btw, I'm no expert on pump & dump. Have never been involved in it, yet have sensed it happening before and have friends that lost money on what sure felt like P&D.
If the price goes up at all, shorts will have to cover their position, causing a squeeze.

The biggest difference is paper hands will take profits lessening the impact of any squeeze. But it's not a binary event. It's not squeeze or no squeeze. The more long term holders there are (knowing some will paper hand), the more dramatic the squeeze will be. So, yeah, it's unlikely to go 10000% IMO bc there will be selling on the way up but a squeeze is inevitable

Is your point, don't be disappointed to just 5x your money??? I'll find a way to survive

I'm in it for 1st quarter earnings/console cycle. That alone will take it to 50.  A squeeze would just be icing on the 🎂

The first season was really hard to watch. From there on its a masterpiece.

There is not a single series where all the dots connect so well. Literally all you see has meaning. Sometimes a state in an empty street will get picked up 5 years later to reveal a big twist. The way the characters are standing or even small things will have relevance years down the line when the dots all connect.

It's a masterpiece.
Whatever the fuck this is.... It's hardly reasonable.....  At least from the judgement of 1: Tesla being a well-liked and consistently somewhat overpriced stock, and 2: a two-year investment..... Two hundred thousand percent? Tf?  That's two thousand times the value.  Who tf would bet you two thousand times your money anything?

It can’t be a squeeze if the shorts didn’t capitulate ( that means, they didn’t cover for you retards) it’s still got a ways to go

MONDAY: 
The market didn’t know what to make of Ryan’s assignment to the BOD and didn’t realize GME pulled out of the ICR conference. 

TUESDAY:
Shorts didn’t want to blow their load too early with no negative news. New investors were able to digest the news fully.

WEDNESDAY:
Belief that Monday’s news was positive leads to large accumulation early that fueled the run up for the entire day.

THURSDAY:
FOMO investors buy in wanting some trendies too. Shorts also begin to blow their load to slow down momentum.

FRIDAY:
Large accumulation is over with a negative opening. Shorts double down to create a retracement. SSR rule is triggered. Rest of day, share price is looking for support. Potentially finds bottom support at $34 and begins to consolidate by oscillating between $37 and $34 for rest of day.

NEXT TUESDAY:
Could continue to consolidate if $34 support maintains.
Could explode due to more large accumulation. (if there is any)
Could explode with any positive news from GME board of directors or from Ryan Cohen himself over the 3-day weekend.

Either way I feel next week will be fun.

I know that? You responded to someone talking about the market moving Monday with the statement it's closed Monday. So I pointed out the European market isn't.

short squeeze means the hedge fund has to rebuy stock at some point in future, so if we buy before that we end up increasing the price but they end up getting losses multiplied by the amount of leverage hedge funds use.

melvin might end up being bankrupted or even shrinking after their investors leave if they lose a lot of money over the past month and upcoming weeks because of this short selling play.

From what I understand, Pltr licenses the software, and the AI aggregates and presents huge swaths of company data in a tangible manner in which our human brains can understand. The AI scales itself with data, and in the process human capital more efficient, which saves companies crap tons of money and manpower, the value in doing that makes pltr money. Pltr develops the AI with engineers and data analysts/scientists.
Anyone who does actual DD did.  Most of these retards only mess with the meme stocks if they’re being mentioned 500x per day in this thread.  Ive done nothing but make money the last few years on Nio

Float indicates the number of shares of a stock available for trading, for example there may be 100M shares o/s but 25M are owned by insiders and not available for trading, so the float is 75M.
Please clarify what you think is illegal about retail investors working together to make money?

If someone comes in here with true insider information then the posting of it in a public forum makes it public information and therefore you and I are not trading on insider information but said provider of that information could still run afoul of the SEC.

Please help me understand where you see the risk of SEC involvement.

Our greatest risk is that we get purposefully bad information or we are manipulated for someone else's gain which I am sure we are to greater or lesser extent nearly every day.

A serious answer to your questions is that options have ton of variables that all move at the same time and they can be used for an almost unlimited amount of strategies.  If you want to buy an option you have to understand the impact of Delta, Gamma, Theta, Vega, and Volga.  If you want to delta hedge then you need to be aware of Vanna and Charm.  To play correctly you need to understand how they all work together and impact each other.  You also need to understand how dealer option positioning impacts the market in the underlying.  As a beginner, Theta is the one you really need to understand at first as Theta gangsters will be robbing you blind when you just start.  Once you understand how to take advantage of Gamma, then you will start raping those helpless Theta petty criminals over a barrel.  But you need to always be thinking about Vega.  If you are long options than Vega and Volga will be your friend right until they turn against you and you get IV crushed.  Then all of sudden those fucking Theta bandits will look smart again.  Once you have a feel for all those things then there is at least a small chance that you may survive around here long enough to get fucking banned.  Godspeed fellow retard!

I'm from Italy and using Etoro. Tried to use T212 (it's better in a way because you have a lot more stocks to trade in comparison to etoro, but it doesn't give you leverage as etoro does) but I can't use the real account because they don't accept my documents.
So I stick with etoro and I'm all in gme as all the retards here. However it's your money dude. I don't have so much experience but I would say to you to diversify your account maybe? With four stocks if you have 200 $: you can go 50 x2 on stock1 50x2 on stock number 2 and so on 🙂

I guess that’s my point though. Tesla and GM are the only ones who have developed these systems and already put in multiple generations of iterations...I agre the Tychan is better than the first Tesla. But they were able to do tear downs on model s’s and try to reverse engineer them. Plus a bulk of Tesla’s patents are open source. It’s a little different than starting from nothing like Tesla did. Plus battery technology today blows away what was out when the first Tesla was released

Don’t really see the correlation between restaurants and AMZN, that doesn’t make sense. And I’ll argue that a lot of the struggle is really poor business decisions, not being able to let go when it’s failing, or making money but not the desired amount
My $70K in May 20C, 30C calls agree with your short term price target
Generating a high yield for cash that you aren't investing, or for your margin that's sitting there.
Or getting paid to wait to buy stock in a company you like, but for a better price.
is that a us thing?
the fact california is still so locked down is really getting to me. about to go insane that i can’t go to the gym
It’s a p&d, man.
Joke or serious?
Thanks for responding. I am taking time to look more thoroughly, and you seem to be onto something apropos of vito and fans.
Idk what your dad told you, but i also don't trust these sources. All estimated: could be right or could be wrong. Important is the SI data reported twice a month. The only reason why we skyrocketed on wednesday was because the new SI data until 12/31/20 came out tuesday night. Everyone saw that short-covering wasn't the reason for december run up, and that they in fact increased their short position. This - mixed with a tweet by Cramer followed by a lot of buying (maybe some whales) and also short covering of some extent led to the stock doubling. 

So until 1/26 or 27 we won't know for sure how many shorts have covered but i'm pretty sure the SI is still insanely high, because for every short being covered a new short opened their position this week. 

I've been trading GME since mid 2020 and it follows a pretty easy pattern. It trades sideways for awhile and then shoots up to a new high; followed by a slow decline to a lower level but still higher than before. It will trade at this base and then squeezes again and repeat.

My limited experience in the market saw me going through quite a few three day weekends... There's still a little uncertainty with the top Democrat senator (I think) who doesn't want to pass the $1400 additional stimulus, kinda like McConnel did for the republicans over the most recent $600 check. Always got to be that one asshole...  


But to me, the bigger reason is what I went through over the christmas, and then new year holiday. Three day weekends are kinda rough for gains, but like I said, with barely 3/4 of a year spent in the market, I could be knowing shit about this... But from a personal point, I have seen crappy gains on Fridays especially before a three day weekend...

It's market conditions and a frothy environment bringing in people eager to make a profit, which is good. How long it lasts I dunno but a pull back will wipe a lot of people out. I'm more concerned about individuals not taking profits or losing too much then the SEC trying to make sense of all this. Big money isn't gonna change they'll pick the bones of retail as a side dish.

There isn't any genuine consensus and it's more like herd mentality and the herd is a bunch of cats.

How long till u can give everyone back their pebbles u borrowed? U can't.

72.5 million on Friday. No way that WSB. Consistent 1 million more shares being sold more than being bought. 

I watched that all day, if shares being bought went up, share being sold went up staying at just 1 million more. 

Felt like some computer algo bear trap just bleeding the price 1 cent at a time after it was pumped 25% pre-market. 

position of 102 at 10.43
"We've amplified a shit stock"

You do realize GME has excellent fundamentals right?
Depends on who’s holding the shares, look at Tesla is 800 a fair valuation of a company that loses money? It’s a valuation on the expected potential. Well it depends on the belief level of GME, are they the gaming Tesla or are they blockbuster?

Yeah I’m gonna get massive downvotes but I don’t care. I’ll be copy & pasting and spreading the message. It seriously feels like a discord group got together to pump $BB and dump it. It’s a terrible fucking pick.

Do people here unironically trade options without knowing the greeks?
Open Interest (OI) is the number of contracts currently in play for that particular option (option type, expiration, strike). Volume is the number of contracts bought and sold for that particular option on that day only. OI can increase or decrease daily as new contracts are created or covered (closed out). Unfortunately OI is only updated daily after hours. So to the point above, if OI is high and Volume is high but less than or similar to OI then the volume could just be existing OI being closed out and not an inflow of smart money. BUT if Volume is greater (ideally much greater) than existing OI then by default we know that new contracts for that particular option have been created and thus new (potentially smart) money is coming in big at that call/put, strike and expiration.
Don’t agree. Screw institutional money. If enough of us can influence markets collectively then do it

Okay fellow autists, im convinced. I will be buying $GME shares on the dips this week. Ive got enough for maybe 10 shares and one 1/22 40c, but I will be doing my part to form the bag holder support at $37,$35 -hell even $31 if $GME is feeling generous. Regardless, Tuesday I start scaling in.

Honest DD, I think the long weekend is good for exposure as to what is happening with $GME. I've lurked in this community since the before Tesla split times. Since $AMD was trading in the $30's. Never before have I seen this community rise up together like this, united under such a virtuous cause.

GODSPEED, SEE YOU ALL IN VALHALLA

$BB has 8% short interest. While GameStop has over 100% short interest on the stock. I will be posting this all weekend to warn r/wallstreetbets because if you’re investing in $BB you’re hoping on a pump on the news that dropped (which did happen) it is NOT short squeeze candidate. This weeks price action on GME was not the result of the short squeeze at all. On fundamentals alone shorts haven’t exited their positions.

Mods. 

This guy has like 4 posts in the history of his reddit account. He is full of shit and pretending to have bought 10,000 shares of GME with no proof.
Join the fucking rewards you tards. Considering it buying a gme share. Will only help earnings and overall profitability. Someone else on here broke it down but like after 3 months u make ur $15 back and then some as far as discounts on pan and xbox live etc etc. plus once they launch a new line up of products theyll prolly re work the rewards and return policy. So youll be like grandfathered in maybe ? Wishful thinking prolly but fuck it. 

DD: if you can yolo 10k on shares and be ok about it. Throw the extra $15 to secure upwards progression. Lol 

For the autists/tards: GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🍗🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🍑 if you buy into power play
Happy to give my support, even if it wasn't through the best avenue.  From what I can understand Autism Speaks treats autism as a disease to be avoided and cured, I can definitely understand what's wrong with that line of thinking.

This needs to be a pinned post here. The whole post was relevant to everyone on this sub sprewing shit and thinking the big timers aren't tryna cut us out.
Market is forward looking, unless there is an unexpectedly large sell-off, the event itself shouldn't bring significant downward pressure.

Nah, just buy GME. Trust me bro.
SPY / IWM 1/29 exp credit spreads seem likes free money. Easy 50% profit. What am I missing?
I can tell you think much, look at how high it went up in a fucking day and ask yourself if you think that makes sense. If the answer is yes, then call up your wife’s boyfriend and tell him you need some cash.

Someone sent me a private message this morning asking me about the GME play and whether or not he should drop $1000 into it, being new to investing.  While I'm no expert, the last thing I would want to tell a newbie is to get into options, especially with something as volatile as GME right now.  They're gonna go for the cheapest OTM plays they can find, expiring next week, and not understanding about IV or theta or even expiration will cause them to be fucked come January 23.  :)  Shares are a much safer play, and for every share you buy in a cash account that's one fewer share that can be borrowed.  (Note to the SEC: I did not give financial advice to the person who contacted me.  I am highly unqualified to do so.)  


I have shares in both my Roth and my taxable accounts, but when I started with GME I bought a LEAPS in my taxable account in September because I thought playing PMCCs with it would be a good idea.  Then shit got serious, and I picked up more options and some shares.
I’m in tbh i love apple any reason to get in is good enough for me
Time decay gets affected by time only or with volatility also??

They didn't exercise those calls.  They not only did not have the capital to do so, the loans they took to buy the calls themselves were being called in, at the time.

Bruh, I think you need to ask for a larger allowance..
BB is still a strong buy, however there could be a dip first
But why would they? The shorts push price down. If there aren’t any shorts left the price will go up because we are buying like autists
All you gotta do is find 10-20 struggling companies and throw a public 100k "YOLO" into them and start posting about how there will be a turnaround. Just straight up copy the real DFV storyline with GME and hope 1-2 out of the 20 gains enough traction to pump it up enough to take advantage of members FOMO'ing into it.
smh
Lol. People need to consider the volume being traded. 

It’s much more easier to manipulate a low volume stock than a high volume one.
that is extremely illegal

Not saying you are wrong or right, but if u base your trades solely on insider sell/buy you are retarded. Do your own DD instead, bookmark those events down in notes or whatever, compile them and see if those news are significant or not. Also, 17mil/2.7B rn gme market cap, so like 0.7%, and those people are the one leaving the company. Again, if you never do dd, don’t push opinions out like it’s a given, because even when you’re right you are basically just got lucky , and if you are wrong you’ll just try to justify it as market being dumb.

But investing? As in buy and hold? Yeah, I know I suck at that.
[deleted]
One thing you didn't mention that is probably the biggest factor to consider..

Of the trading activity that takes place on any given ticker, retail traders have little to no influence in price action.

The portion of the pie we hold in comparison to institutions is negligible, laughable, etc.

Yes, there are a few whales amongst us that if they dipped their balls in a low float we could highlight that tick or two it would produce, but that's it.

The rest of us plebs are just children managing to drown in a ball pit.
no balls

Buy GME shares. We dip buy GME shares.

>The Dunning-Kruger Effect is a cognitive bias in which people with a low ability of a given task are prone to overestimate their ability at that task.

Ironically this is incorrect. I know that this is also the common explanation (which is even more ironic) because it is not accurate to what the [paper](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Unskilled-and-unaware-of-it%3A-how-difficulties-in-to-Kruger-Dunning/f2c80eef3585e0569e93ace0b9770cf76c8ebabc?p2df) reads.

The Dunning-Krueger Effect is better understood to be a simple failure of metacognition. In short-hand: "You don't know that you don't know something and you can't realize that you don't know it." Overconfidence is a side-effect but not actually the effect itself; self-assessment typically is overdrawn but the parabolic effect isn't as "outlandish" as popular media makes it out to be; for instance people who are just starting with options might say, "I understand the greeks" but then turn around and ask something that requires you to understand the greeks *but* that shouldn't be mistaken for the idea that people simply fail to understand that they *don't* know everything about options, hence the question to begin with, etc.

[You are more likely to suffer Illusory Depth](https://ritholtz.com/2019/08/the-illusion-of-explanatory-depth/?utm_source=feedburner&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=Feed%3A+TheBigPicture+%28The+Big+Picture%29) in this particular case of investing in a "wild" market. Also, I would not consider this a "bull" market in the traditional sense; the number of winners and losers last year (that is, companies that literally no longer exist, not just companies that lost value) is astronomical; what happened with bonds and liquidity functions of other assets and such is not equivalent to a normal and steady rise in valuation over time at all. That's why there are so many saying, "The Second Coming" is coming for a fall out and honestly they might be right with the dollar being forcibly devalued. How long can that truly last? We don't know. We've never done this before in history. Which is ironic because again to understand these effects (this is a close cousin of DK) you'll make up stories as to why things occurred. What this means is also you can create [Economic Narratives](https://www.amazon.com/Narrative-Economics-Stories-Economic-Events/dp/0691182299) which turn out to be exactly what drives a series of interesting effects.

We can actually prove this; let's take for instance the Gamestop situation. So first we have "the initial buyers", like DeepFuckingValue, now the question is simple: Did he know that Gamestop would rebrand and Ryan Cohen would take interest almost a year and a half before it happened? No. So then, that begs another question; did the short-squeeze itself warrant these prices? No. Now, of course, in the history of the world we will write that *he did* and that there was no difference between the events that occurred and his state simply because it all rolls into itself very nicely (hence Illusory Depth with Narrative) into a clean story.

The reality is that there are people who make bets like this all the time *and lose* but we don't remember them. Another good story is the Ambulance driver who made a million percent or something; in that same thread there was a guy whose calls expired *one week too early* and do you know what? I remember the Ambulance Driver. I don't remember the other guy.

We can say the same of Tesla; everyone has an explanation as to why Tesla soared *after the fact* but no one expected this to occur in a single year and anyone who gives an explanation of it is practically lying through their teeth since the story itself of clean energy is 40 years old. There are many, many examples where things went sideways, make no sense, will be explained after the fact, or are just flat out garbage that people will buy into because they see the ticker and know that it will rise regardless of it's actual viability.

TL;DR: **The greatest threat to you in this market are the stories you tell yourself not the knowledge base you think you have.**
For what it's worth, just because the moratorium has gone on for a year doesn't mean all of the people benefiting from it have been jobless for a year. I'm sure some have and they will have a huge bill waiting for them when it's over.
With the new administration I'd stay away from anything fossil fuels. Unless you're planning on short selling.

BlackBerry is specifically focused on cybersecurity software, which should be one of the biggest growth engines for the sector over the next decade. Its Cylance division, for example, can detect threats before they happen by using advanced artificial intelligence networks.

How does the market value software stocks like this?

CrowdStrike, a cybersecurity competitor, trades at 64 times sales. Meanwhile, BlackBerry trades at 4.3 times sales. That’s a huge gap!

If BlackBerry stock rose 1,000% in 2021, it would still trade at a healthy discount to its peer group. 

And then there's Automotive Division QNX. Most of the cars are on QNX, with deals with Sony, Nio, etc lining up.

Personally, when the share price drops below what I bought it for, that's the PERFECT time to buy more. I've found that when you lower your "average price" paid for a stock, it makes the returns that much sweeter because you've lowered your overall buy in price...

Lol not small time shops. You should be getting some relief by the Biden stimulus package. I’m talking about the commercial side. Raising min wage should help you out and as far as small business goes, it’s likely that there won’t be as much damage because staffing requirements are not as necessary due to the pandemic (don’t need a high head count if the shop is closed) e-commerce driven models. I think the only places really fucked is restaurants and bars, general entertainment But I don’t think min wage will be impactive since a lot of the income is tip driven.
yeah I know, GME is on European market too

Fuck, well if $GME goes down then I guess i'm going down with it.
For my money's worth - and I'm an investor much more often than a trader - I would close all of these positions. The squeeze is over and they're all correcting downward.

It's impossible to time the market perfectly, but it's just bad practice to buy incredibly volatile spikes on any news other than a merger or acquisition, since those are the only things that sustain huge price spikes.

Just my two cents. But if you're happy with your positions, keep 'em. Either way, take notes. GL with your holdings and welcome to the mad circus XD

 Or hell, take the big boy as an example: 
China has been robbed, destroyed, the robbed some more and then the japanese killed a fuckton of people there. Then they went through civil "war", and yet, China is the strongest economy. AND the average chinese lives far better than the average african.

Lol ofcourse. Nobody remembered gamestop pulling out of ICR last minute? They are 100% working on a new presentation with their new "master plan" (we really need to come up with a great word for this). Short interest is still the same/increased so the SP increase is just becuase of sentiment. In 1/2 weeks shorts will have to cover, gamestop will share their new plan for growth and Ryan Cohen will increase his stake to 20% (why wouldnt he). 
We are really just getting started. Everyone is saying this and it might look too good to believe but remember, its gamestop. The one thing we can learn from $GME history is that the market isnt efficient. People still believe gamestop is going bankrupt and I cant blame them, I used to think this too. However we know better now and can use this opportunity to make us all rich and donate to charity and move on to the next stock (pltr, maybe BB). Good luck everyone, may the tendies be in your favor! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

But what's significant about GME? No I don't know much about IBM I'm in secondary school in the UK so not much coverage on your markets other than from Bloomberg but they don't talk about this stuff either
That honestly made me laugh aloud.  One meme stock here went up, among the dozens that have crashed and burned, and suddenly "WSB controls the market!"

I like WSB, all the goofiness and memes and long-shots.  Most gain porn is a retard hitting the lottery, and even the posters tend to acknowledge that.  But this sudden influx of self-congratulatory bullshit is offputting.  Even retards guess right once in a while, but that doesn't make them any less retarded.
100 different warts on your balls excellent
For people looking for a contrary play..load up on july GME PUTS...this shit won’t go on forever..i give it a month....the retards will jump on the next stock train once the hype dies down For gme,it will crash down straight...the fact that gme insiders are selling millions in stock is a tell tell..one of the directors in company recently sold $17 million in stock..highest ever single time sell in the companys history...people who got in at $15-$17 will be fine..people who are buying now will get burnt..
They have 2 options
Delaying as much as possible for min. losses while they cover

Here’s why;

You bought the 2/4 45c when GME was at 40-42.

GME went down to 36. Now you can average down on the 2/4 but since you believe it will bounce back quick, you go with a shorter expiry and a lower strike like 40c because if it plays in your favor 40c will print but 45c will still need one or two more Green Day’s to recover.

I’ve done this with SQ Friday. Held 250c at loss but bought 240c on a shorter expiry.
Not good
35c, they’re down about 33% after I averaged down at the end of day yesterday

The math doesn’t make sense to me:
TSLA at 10/24/2019 was $50/share.
He invested $1556/$50 = 31 shares.
31 TSLA shares x $850 = $26,350
What am I missing bois?

Oh, I'm in for the squeeze. I rubbed my pennies together and bought what shares I could afford. Limit sell at $75 & $100 gtc+ext. Set it and forget it.
Also, under the short squeeze thesis, buying on margin means your broker will loan the shares to shorts. If you buy the shares with a cash account then they potentially won't.
You know damn well they lurk.

It's the voter base that is the problem though. People actually think the Federal Government setting a wage floor for 50 vastly different states solves World Hunger™. People fucking love to claim they'll eat out more because "it'll only amount to 15% price increase" (some made up figure), but then hop right on Amazon/Whole Foods and buy some meal kit or some shit and watch their ancestors 50 year old local restaurant go under.

Not surprised if you read Reddit long enough. The demographic wants to get rid of the Senate because they hate a government branch that actually allows states like Montana to have equal representation to California without being drowned out.

Largely, I look at where the stock has been over the last 3, 6, and 12 months. I try to find a pattern between the low and high, and what kind of happenings took place to trigger a rise/fall (news stories? Company changes? Product releases? Etc)

Then, I research the people behind the company. What the did before, what led them to where they are now, and hopefully, what they/the company plan to do moving forward. 

I try to look at the competition in the sector, to feel if they have a good product, etc.
Yeah that was my thinking I cashed out Thursday because of the huge spike. And bought back yesterday. I bought too high though and had to keep averaging down. I’m gonna keep this long term now though. 🚀

Yea would be great. I'm assuming you've been around long enough to know its taken the GME squeeze 6 months to come to fruition and even then the MM have deep pockets. Not everything can be short squeezed by us on command for your gain. Bring some real DD and we'll talk
Its basically a loan. If you use zero percent of the loan you are good. If you use 70% of the loan and its all in risky stock, you could be in trouble. If you have 10% margin in risky stock and you have stock you paid cash for that can cover the 10% in case the risky stock takes a shit, youre fine. If you are using 100% margin and have not deposited any significant amount of cash to your account, you're basically at the mercy of the broker. Bad place to be.

As you use your margin you should always have more value in the stock you paid cash for. To lower your use of margin you need to sell cash purchased stock or deposit cash to your account. Like paying back the loan. 

Disable margin is the safest play if youre not certain about your investments.
He said we need to invest in things like clean energy and biotech, put big emphasis on biotech, and these will pay off with huge returns in the future, the US needs to dominate these emerging fields etc.
Lot of insider sales within gme on 1/14 & 1/15?
Wouldn’t it be $13800 x 50 contracts (so $690,000)+ the $1500 to purchase the options into $3 mil? Don’t you have to buy the shares for this to be realized? Sorry, this part keeps confusing me about options. The $1500 just give them the right to buy the options, correct? Did this not cost about $691,500 to make $3 mil?

After watching the beginning of this channel I'm not convinced this is DFV.

This guy did make a good call in August 2020 about Gamestop but Roaring Kitty was talking about having positions in over a hundred tickers in July 2020 while DFV has seemingly only had positions in Gamestop and cash since he started posting about it in September 2019.
COVID was just catalyst to destroying small businesses, $15 minimum wage will finish them off.
Hm okay I see. thank you for the explanation !
Awesome DD, with your points and the market cap being what it is I just can't see $PLTR going any higher. Sure the company seems great but the financials just do not back the current value. 

I wish you autists the best and hope it works out for ya but it doesn't make any sense to me. How can $BB not be extremely undervalued in cybersecuruty with $PLTR at it's current price?
Depends did you earn it all yourself or did you have parental help with paying for college, starting out, safety net, etc

Only temporarily. At $100 per share (totally reasonable for a giga squeeze) that's only 1M shares. It's likely they'd do it when shit gets really crazy, so I wouldn't worry about it too much.

What happens to banks when landlords can't pay their mortgages I wonder...
There's a lot of DD in this thesis beyond a short squeeze. It's much more likely GME doesn't go below 20 for years, than it is for GME to break 100.
Why do you say that?
Honestly don’t see how those stocks would be remotely impacted either way. Both parties have the same line on this shit.
Thanks king
Your English is otherwise flawless.  But I always catch the prize/price mistake!  

Btw I'm hodling my meager GME stonk position.
I think so if inauguration goes well, Biden green plans also a price catalyst, if the rest of the market stays flat or goes green, I think we have a good chance of gaining some ground toward 1000
Why do people keep posting this?
I literally have no idea what I’m doing, but I cashed out on lmnd after doubling my money in a month. This seems to confirm everything you’re saying but also fuck you.
If you can’t pay your rent for a full year you shouldn’t have an apartment to stay at. Homeless shelters are for people who can’t afford to pay rent. And being there for a couple weeks will surely make you want to figure out how to pay rent

If i was a betting man id say theres more red. Technicals are crying for it. One can have the opinion its overcorrected but thats not at all what rsi is saying on the 10 and 1mo. Also the candles have been hanging men two in a row. Still early on the macd that its hardly showing us a reversal + were miles above the vwap so you can count on retail alone providing the buying pressure if there is any. Most likely scenario is that the gaps on the way up will fill and that this could easily hit at least the 50 gap. Lets be honest cus fundamentals dont support the price where its at either. We can talk all we want about how thisll be the future and what not but the reality is much thinner, nothing proprietary, no revenue, no guarantees, and if we are talking about the future then its definitely too soon and too fast in terms of price action. This was already a ten bagger for some at 50 in the short span of a handful of months.
Sounds like a cheap YOLO bet

Thank you
I can also add that smarter people than me can show that the short interest has only increased, and something something uptick rule (whatever the hell that is) takes more ammo away from the shorts. So the prediction of a rally is partially based on the shorts having fewer tools for price suppression at their disposal.

Here's the thing guys. There's different ways to make the stock go up. 

I'm not an SEO person but what if we start building a network of WSB'ers to flood the internet with shitty articles about a company saying its going up up up. 

The articles start ranking higher on Google, so the fucktard robinhood users, and Stocktwits crowd start to latch onto it. They're FOMO kicks in and they start buying the stock like crazy, then boom. 

We've successfully amplified a shit stock. Certainly there's a way to take advantage of a situation like this.
The “days to cover” metric is a good indication of how long to rally will last before it’s over. It’s a measure of total volume traded divided by the number of shares sold short. So essentially it’s the amount of days of the same volume that will be needed to close out the short position. 

Obviously volume can change at the drop of a hat, but at least you have some basic idea of how long it could potentially take

If you’re worried about not being around to sell, just set your sell limit to 420.69 and you’ll be fine

What legit?
I'm so hard rn, my 🍆 just🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
There’s so many variables on both the supply and demand side once a trigger starts. That’s why sometimes it’s short and violent like VW or drawn out like TSLA. 

Once a squeeze starts:

There’s two big players and a pile of late-coming retail (in form of puts) on the demand-for-shares side.

There’s a large pool of supply from all us on the retail side big and small. I’m sure the exiting directors would dump the rest of their piles once commenced. And the current board would be crazy to not execute that shelf offering during this. For these reasons, it could be a choppy climb.

So who the hell knows. I’m going to be watching volume if it appears to be short and violent.
Don’t forget about Uncle Sam 🤡
Correction: they had 54000 put contracts. No one has any idea how many shares they have shorted. Short shares are not shown on a 13F. Long puts are, so the 5400000 GME shares on their disclosure was puts that just got wiped out for a $45MM loss
I think if anything it goes to $20. I still believe RC will do something with them.

I'm all for the MOAS but I also don't hate money and so far my GME position is already up 300%. When you're managing a 7 figure portfolio, and want to consistently make money you learn how not to be a retard pretty quickly.

Just curious, how much capital do you have at risk on GME that you're preaching holding till 180+?
Yeah, mentioned that right in the first paragraph.
It's illegal for us to work together, yet one analyst can influence a stocks price based on opinions? BS. Find a stock with a low float and minimal shares outstanding, and get everyone to buy it all. Use a limit order to avoid being taken

Why is everyone so sensitive? I can't even use the word autistic on Twitter when referring to you guys and GME.
Did anyone ask how much he started with and total investment?
It’s a fairly easy difference to spot, and being the son of a lawyer I’m not worried about most of the sub. I’ve been in some minor situations where a large company has tried to fuck me and dad basically says “you’re not worth their time, they have bigger fish to fry” and he’s been right every time.

The people that should be worried are the ones who post about pumping a stock and then post $1,000,000+ gains. That’s money worth going after.
It doesn't make payoffs more linear. Every additional call adds gamma. The only way to make payoffs more linear is to sell puts to reduce your gamma and leg yourself into a synthetic forward or sell further OTM calls to leg yourself into a call spread.
I think it’s down or bugged out. No idea.

Hello people 

I've recently been introduced to the world of shares and am enjoying reading through this sub with the idea of adding to my portfolio. 

Serious question, I have 14 GME shares and am thinking of buying more when the market opens on Monday - should I?

And if I do, what's the game plan? Hold on for months or an expected price that it possibly won't top?


Appreciate the advice and the sub

Suds
GME is going up. It's going up so much you would never believe it. People will be talking about this for a long, long time
So you're argument is that since it's tanked 3 times in a row it will tank again? Even tho this time it hasn't even run up yet. That's just really bad logic and it's a completely different set up this time. Things don't always repeat themselves perfectly 100% of the time either.

It being "a hundred dollar stock" means it has a market cap of $6-7B. 

People here are only thinking about stock price without considering available shares.
Lol. Yesterday I threw money at a 0dte around 11am. I just needed this Spac stock to move by +0.10%. I kid you not, it didn’t move and my contracts expired worthless. MM’s got me on that one
Absolutely 🚀🚀
I own shares and am annoyed, down 10% and counting. Didn’t buy the dip because there were too many other dips I liked better.
VW was initiated as Porsche bought a huge chunk of the float ( cant remember, but I think more than 50% ) to get ownership. So relatively GME short float is lower, as the institutional/locked/whatever holdings are much smaller
Depends where you live. Depends on how you use it.
Yeah I might schedule some cuz I see it rising back up Tuesday morning at the rate it’s been. There is no real news against the company it simply dipped cuz people cashed out. I think a new wave will come Tuesday. TO THE MOON. This is my new ship🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🛰🛰🛰🛰🛰🛰🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

U r doing a disservice to this sub by calling out borderline illegal activities. No. 1. That’s seeking unwanted scrutiny from the mrdia

No. 2. u would be naive to think the big institutions do not influence/manipulate/front run markets. I’m sure u were just making a point

Most importantly. Covid democratized investing - in terms of access, education, as well as empowering retail/younger people to express their their views, that in aggregate, can at times have a much bigger influence than they would individually - and they come in various shape or forms.

To want to only take the good without the bad, call out everyone and their moms - is hypocritical, everyone learn their own lessons, and u don’t come to wsb for only good investment advice . U come for the meme and the laughs. embrace this sub in its wholesome  . No need to be anal about it. 

As someone who’s involved in trading in large us institution , maybe you do too it sounds like, we all know that, wsb is not dumber or smarter than ur average joe  on wall steeet , or those who giving advice on CNBC /bloomberg tv . There are so many clowns and criminal in this historically arcane industry with an artificially high barrier of entry that wsb is not the worst thing that can happen to the future of investing and to the younger generation

You understand GME has the option of a shelf offering meaning when we pump the stock they have the ability to sell more for massive amounts of revenue to cover their debts?  Or are you just a fucking retard who likes to try to sound smart without being informed.

You know short squeezes don’t keep the price high forever. Eventually it’ll come back down and you still have a failing business. 

Don’t think of GME as a long term investment at this point.

Well, tell us how you really feel! Point taken, sire or ma'am.
Because you may believe a stock might jump or dip in price but it's difficult to time when the price is going to move. Each new option with a different expiration gives you another chance to get the timing and strike correct. So you may get it wrong one week but kill it on the options you have at the next expiration
Is it too late to buy?

More risk in one position. Could make more could lose more.
Yeah, this is something few here would have considered betting on back then, even at $1500, but they got really lucky. That or as several comments have pointed out, it's fake, evidence being the the missing commas in the percent. It's possible that is just how it is on the website / app but seems suspicious they have commas for the total gain $ value but not percent. Need to compare it to someone with a 1,000 or greater percent gain.
Oof. Thanks for letting people know!

The way to do it never trade in a massive margin. Never trade indexes. Go short once 3 weeks and only for a shit tile. 
If you trade in margin watch the wsb board and buy into that the buzz
Is about and cash out with 2-30 perfect. Then seek to buy back in at the dip

You don’t sound very sure about this; I’m sticking with my initial assertion.
Making $10 an hour at my internship now, not awful but not great. I choose my hours and it's a pretty relaxed workplace. Getting experience while a freshman in college is super valuable though.

No I only put in $500 @ $10.60 a share. Obviously right now I'm at about a $50 loss. I also put in $150 @ 35.60 for GME, $200 @ 13.10 in APHA, & $150 @ 26.65 in PLTR. Im hoping these all go up. I've been reading a bit of what been said here and r/investing and decided this was what was best for me ATM. Like I said, this is my first time investing so I thought $1k would be a good starting point to see if this is for me or not.

EDIT: I am unfamiliar with option calls and what not so I didn't bother messing with that. I need to be educated on this all and do my research.

I've shorted metals since August but now is the first time Im convinced Pete Schiff is right about gold, at least in the short term. The only reason the price is suppressed is because investors are selling due to rising yields. But yields are rising due to inflation fears. You can see it the entire commodities market, except precious metals. Price of gold and silver is coiled to explode. Thanks for listening

Yeah show them the dude that turned $50k into $7MM
Because he is buying puts on Cathy and WSB
I guess you aren't the brightest bulb in the shed huh? If only the world existed of just black and white 🤷‍♂️
You assume that a lot of people here know what they are doing but

Staggering OTM calls would derisk your overall position assuming half end up ITM the rest not and Wsb likes diamond handing everything 

My guess at least 

*** assuming all same expiration
It’s just the final dagger in the heart of small business. That’s what he was sent here to do. And (maybe) half the population is actually stupid enough to not see their agenda
You sir are advanced as shit PM me any time to drop your knowledge on me. 

Also with timing I’ve been noticing a weird king of lag lately, almost like algos catch up on news a bit slower in recent times
How? There aren’t any shares to short, and every share sold off of robinhood is 1 more short share coming off the market...
[deleted]
It's possible
Hey I have a question ! What eould be different if he i.e called tsla price to be lets say $90 ? He would have just lest sellers ? The premium cost would be higher ? The thing im asking is, what is the price you pay for more risk ??
The SEC would jump in and fuck us harder than TSLA fucks Michael Burry each week
[deleted]
Market closed on Monday lol
lol, internet =/= websites

educate yourself

Imagine you could do manual labor for option contracts like instead of direct deposit they just give you a two Tesla FD at the end of your shift
Someone please explain why this doesn't work.

I sell a cash secured put on F. F doesn't tank so I just gain premium.

Or F tanks so I get assigned. Now I own some F, so I sell a covered call at a strike price higher than my average cost adjusted for the premium I gained. 

F doesn't moon so I just gain premium.

Or F moons so I get assigned. Now I've sold F at a profit.

At no point do I actually lose on this? 

Why am I wrong
Lol he runs a whole sub. He's not showing you that. He has thousands of posts. I dont simp for anyone. If his plays were shit, I would say so. When I see people post wrong information, like you have I like to set the record straight. I wish he would invite you to the sub, let you see exactly what I'm talking about, and then permanently ban you for being a dick.
Too many here have short termed minds, but that’s why we’re teaching them about shares and IV instead of FD’s. 

Got rid of my Jan calls Wednesday, bought back my stupid CC’s at a loss, but kept all my shares luckily, even upped my holdings actually to 16k shares (even though it brought my cost basis up from 13 to 14.5)

More Feb calls in case of the 🚀 sooner than later but the rest are Apr/Jul/Jan
get a duplex that is half as nice, use all rental income from the other unit for stonks
I have moved the goalpost pray I do not move it further. This is calvinball.
Buying property is just about the best way to invest your money my dude. If you have the down payment it’s a great move. Highly recommend.
I want to see us on the board.
>You're

"I think we could **easily** hit +80% over the next 6 months when the short % of free float will return to 140% it makes **a lower bound PT of $34 without a short-squeeze**. But this doesn’t even account for the fact that some short-sellers will not be able to hold from here. Keep in mind that some shorts have a triple-digit % drawdown already."

Fucking hell, that Clairvoyant!!
Doesn't help your case
spreads limit risk and reward
Nah just add some precious metals to your portfolio or something to hedge idk
I’ve had NIO for the last few months and as soon as I saw that post and the one claiming it was fake I went “aw shit”

Tbh I think I was the best choice for a Chinese Tesla competitor but I’m also an uneducated retard so I guess you win some you lose some. I’ve lost like 20% or so on it so maybe I’ve only lost some.
Ok I’ll set to 420.68 just so I don’t get fucked and can’t sell
I'm trying to get my non WSB friends on the GME rocket, but can't find any good link explaining the play for next week. Does anyone have such a link at hand or care to explain it in a comment?
Am I just really high or are the details on the side for a completely different person and different amount of shares for the same day?
From the surface, doesn't C3.AI do the same thing?
Next time when the market moves against your position, just call time out!
...but that does not influence the stock to decrease further, does it?
It’s the WSB way
[removed]
Boy do these guys have the plans for you
Well I can’t prove it but I have 11 shares.
I bought Feb icln calls  and sold Feb plug puts
I was banned unrelated to WSB
But at what point would Melvin have a claim? A lot of the GME stuff was just advice, and I’ve seen a bunch of the big posts saying what might happen as opposed to “if we all buy and hold until x date we’ll make money.” 

It’s just a bunch of speculation outside of the few imbeciles that actually post “hey if we all buy this we’ll pump the stock up.”
Hello people 

I've recently been introduced to the world of shares and am enjoying reading through this sub with the idea of adding to my portfolio. 

Serious question, I have 14 GME shares and am thinking of buying more when the market opens on Monday - should I?

And if I do, what's the game plan? Hold on for months or an expected price that it possibly won't top?


Appreciate the advice and the sub

Seems like an in-depth article, however a I had a feeling its biased against Palantir. As as an IT guy, there are two things to keep in mind: every software is messy a bit, especially big data. Second, with every release you are improving your shit. And from what I read in the article, they are doing that intensively. Anyways, I have no experience with Palantir, so I guess we need to wait and see. Thanks for posting this article BTW!
So much research! Thanks for the great DD. Been waiting for it to drop some so I can pick up more
i went all in on yesterday dip. maybe should’ve DCA’d but life is short

I love it but would like to add a few things that no one seems to ever mention which I feel is huge. Sandwiched in the investor presentation Palantir mentioned...

The federal government has a law that they cannot stop use of an entity or service that is to their benefit, to try and create something of their own.

Meaning unless someone else comes along and does Palantir better than Palantir, the government by law cannot replace Palantir. They have to stay with them because it provides them a benefit. Palantir SUED the government for this, and won.

In my eyes all of the R&D expense is no different than Amazon or Tesla reinvesting in building their foundation.

This is huge and in my eyes pretty much locks Palantir in to the government. The real combo breaker will be if they can create a new product with a low overhead and lower price point, that can appeal to the masses. Like the Model 3.
Dude. Don’t post insider info like that. You’re gonna get us shut down.

Oh you don't say?
Personally I wish we could get rid of all the 🌈 boomers whining about the "good ole' days" on WSB. 😒
Interesting, what's the play?
I am not throwin away my... calls 😤🦅🇺🇸
Do you think it will get over 860 at any point in time next week? 

I noticed in the week before earnings in the past that the price has swung a 5-10% increase.
Just bang the house keeper
Close guess, but I am Dutch actually, which is pretty damn close. Also, I should know better than to make such spelling errors.
I like it, buying another 200 shares Tuesday if it is in the 9s, try to get my average cost sub 10.
Yeah they’re all posting these surveys, it’s a ploy to understand how much we have and how much leverage we may have come Tuesday
Please do. If we hit $3000 a share, I will be a millionaire and $96000 would be less than 10% after taxes. I encourage everyone that makes a considerable gain do something similar.
I cant figure out the cancelation of margin though. I get canceling for gme shorts or even options but to fully cancel it, i dont get it. I hold all me gme shares on fidelity and my margin is a zero no matter the ticker. Thoughts?
I think it makes the gains more linear with the stock price instead of becoming parabolic. It could also be them averaging down in desperation if it didn't start out spread out.
Melvin is that you?

CFDs, are short-term leveraged derivative contracts that track the value of some underlying instrument and pay off accordingly. Spread betting involves placing a speculative bet on the price movements of an underlying instrument without actually owning it.

Buying a gme cfd does nothing in terms of “helping the cause”.

Ah okay didn't know that. In his profile there is something like 60-40% seriousness / jokes.
Shorts will be looking at buying those calls too if it's anyway cheaper than having to pay market price on the shares, anything to get out of MOASS asap. But we'll more likely be selling to the market makers, pricing will be determined by the greeks (delta and IV in particular) based on the price of the underlying security which will be heading towards the moon.

I mean at this point it's pretty much guaranteed GME will skyrocket to fucking Voyager I territory. We don't know when, but with that much shorts who continue to deep themselves even further towards the Earth core, that stock can do anything but go up. If you guys hold this shit, not only you will not lose money but you will also fuck those bears hard when they'll have to buy those shares at 10x times the price, or even worse. 💎✋

$42 price target in 3 months lets squeeze
I was retarded enough to listen to the NIO post and actually bought into the stock. I sold it like an hour bc I realized what I did. I luckily made money on it, and later that day it did the offering and shot down.
[deleted]
If you click on the details on the side... it is completely a different person and different amount of shares
If you sell something your margin balance becomes positive until it settles or you buy something. If you were all in and sold everything, your margin balance would match your cash until the transactions clear. It doesn't really matter what a positive margin balance is. You only get charged interest on negative margin that isn't collateralized by cash and securities.
Me too.

Yes, that's 1 step backwards in the inference procedure. Wsb buys the same thing, and Robinhood has this data from their own platform, ergo most Robinhood users are wsb users
serious question: (No i’m not new just haven’t hit big big yet) You guys know (some) of the big gains post when someone goes all in on one stock and they have multiple different calls and exps for the stock? Ex: (GME 1/14 40c GME 2/4 45c, etc) why don’t they just go all in on one singular call position? do they make more money doing it their way? genuinely curious. never thought about it doing it that way
Still laughing at those directors that are going out on cashing out their stock at this point. I think the one that only did 5k shares was smart and may have more though
[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyk465/gme\_survey\_3\_shares\_and\_gains/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kyk465/gme_survey_3_shares_and_gains/)

we already have, upvote so people see it
Thanks. Between iborrow showing only 1 mil available for short at 30+% interest and this, shorts don't appear to have covered much, if any.
With the share buybacks that GME has done this year, if they return to a market cap of previous console cycles the share price should be around $150 without a drastic squeeze. I think it depends on if we get a short but volatile squeeze, in which case I legitimately don’t think 500+ is out of the question, or a long and drawn out squeeze like TSLA. But with short interest being as high as it is, it’s really an unprecedented situation. The best play will be to be patient in selling, and keep an eye on falling short interest when the squeeze does happen

Hi, sorry I was temp banned. If you haven't bought yet, please don't. I'm not an expert, but I would wait for BB to consolidate and enter a trend. If I had to guess, that would be around $6-7. It's a fine stock to be sure - just don't buy long term holds after massive spikes and squeezes.

Insider Trading is one worry. Although lol, if you think there aren’t policy makers figuring out ways to regulate large droves of people in the internet age. Especially from moving the market in ways **they** might consider, wrong. 

Only a matter of time until this sub shills the an action that is legal today, but amplification of the internet and access makes it illegal or regulated harsher tomorrow.

PS. Read the sub rules, as many others have pointed out. You are probably at the wrong place at WSB with any P&D insinuations, try Titter or Stocktits instead! Or get yourself invited to the Cramer show.
Awesome effort. I’m holding my PLTR for the long term and buying the dips anyway but its nice to see someone put this effort in. Not expecting it to hit Saturn but reckon it will be a great long term option
This is the angle we are playing. They are hedging so the sting isnt as bad.
As Emperor Palpatine said to Luke, we now say to the shorts:

YOUR ARROGANCE BLINDS YOU.
That's literally what I would do too. It would take half an hour to code a useful crawler to scrape the sub. I'm sure that big instituions do that and bet against us. Big banks love to fuck retail traders but now they have the advantage to read every move beforehand. 
Our only advantage is that we act in a group so it's a bit more difficult to crush us. In the long term I think they will figure out a a way. I don't want to sound to pessimistic but we should enjoy the ride as long as it lasts.

the thing is: Is there any data showing WHEN, which % of shorts are due to get covered? 

A short squeeze qouls not happen of the shorts have to cover one by one and not at the same time
My household income is around $200K right now and yes, I could do this easily. However if properly budgeted, its possible at much lower income levels.
That assumes all 150 shares are due at the same time. They aren’t. They are staggered like call and put contracts. They are coming due constantly each month so they just need enough shares at any given time to cover whatever contract is due at that moment.
Eat a dick
"making $5 every other day"

It's not that simple. I think since your first trade was a winner you think it's easy but it's not. Market goes up and down, it's impossible to time break out stocks like you did with gme and its rare that stocks double in a short amount of time.

Turning 650 into 3-4k could take you a while or if you play options to make it happen quicker you could lose all of that money.

If 2x-4xing your money in a short time span was as easy as you make it sound - especially to someone who's brand new - we'd all be millionaires

Idk why you're simping for a guy with very little post history and all ego.

I did what you asked, I linked examples. Now you may *simp for me*.
I'm holding shares and will probably accumulate some more.  LEAPS maybe not a bad idea - I wouldn't buy short term options, but I usually don't do that anyway.

I’m joining the 🚀 on Tuesday. No more being a pussy, easy money. Going to spend my gains on Palantir. Let’s go boys.
I don't bother exercising options right now. Ender up closing the position for 20k/800%. I tried posting the results but got banned for a day. Wrong spot or something. Dunno, new to WSB. Anyways I dropped after the first peak and fall. Missed out on about 7k max profit, but IV cratered right after so I felt good enough about it.

Worked the rest of the day at my shit job with a shit eating grin. 

I'm definitely a paper hands trader. Usually happy with 10-30% gains on my options plays.
Exxon does have some research going into carbon capture, which has the potential to be a huge field if perfected.

Same here man.  Dems want a stimmy. Whole bunch of that is going straight into stocks and fds.

Also not in the chart is unprecedented levels of options volume. 

Also not in the chart is free stock trades and fractional shares and mobile apps like robinhood. 

Hard to say if data from before 2010 is relevant.

The fed and congress are putting the market before people and i dont see why that wont continue.
Yes, as Biden attempts to push a $1T "clean energy infrastructure" bill, let's be against clean energy.

Also, we don't pump and dump here. This is a casino full of tards, not a cheap downtown bar full of depressed office workers.

You had me at current “Stock Prize”
Excellent DD. Thank you for sharing that.

The market is searching for validation to buy. At large corporations, funds, etc., individuals and teams don’t want to make moves with the risk of being considered a moron and getting fired. Buying into PLTR as an institution right now could label you a moron if analysts from big research houses like Citi are right and it goes to $15-20. Then you’re the guy/gal or desk who bought PLTR for your fund / pension / whatever when everyone was calling PT at $15 and it went to $15.

Right now we have company employees and ownership (locked up), hedge funds, early investors and retail investors in. Then you have the idiots who think the real PT is $15 pushing it down.

So, the kind of buyers that make prices move big time are not in yet. If they were the stock would be well over $50. We need earnings to validate that move. Everything you said about the one-time compensation expenses is spot on. I see R&D as bullish - when companies have massive market opportunity, R&D goes up. Leadership is excellent.

Disclaimer: currently sitting on a 143.52% return already because I bought in the day of the direct listing. Avg cost $10.64.
Nice, gonna be plenty of time to 69 on the moon then

Say a stock is worth $20 today. You buy an ITM 10C for 15 days from now. Tomorrow the stock climbs to $40. How did the probability of the stock being at >$10 in 14 days get affected? You're much more likely to be above $10 after the climb than if it had remained flat. And so the ITM call can rise faster than the time decay eats into it.
Fuck it profits a profit

Ah ok, I misunderstood the intent of your question.  I thought you were mainly asking how much you needed to make for $2K to not be an issue.  If your asking "how much fun do you have at a $2K/invite party", that's a different question.

Pre-COVID I usually ended up at a few of those a year but I didn't count those because I'm usually comped by one of our vendors or paid for by my boss. However, they are hit or miss. I've been to some where we are all completely fucked up and dancing on tables with confetti cannons going off, and others that were boring as fuck.

It really just depends on the crowd and the venue.

This is really helpful. Perhaps it has been suggested already, but perhaps consider posting something like this on the main page, as it is likely a lot of WSBers in GME are going to make bank next week, and are going to want to give back to charities; I can't imaging that the mods wouldn't let it through.

It’s just mind blowing to think what different milestones mean for 2270 shares (another 680 in my IRA). 150 is a house, 250 is that plus retiring in a decade, and anything above 400 is retiring NOW.
You are effectively the old man yelling through his screen door at the kids playing in the yard of the house across the street. Thinking anyone here cares what what you're saying, or that you would change anything, is more cringey than the actual kids themselves. thank you for showing how mature and grown-up you are relative to the average WSB user. People who use the phrase 'ok boomer' unironically are usually the worst type of person, but now I can see the value in that phrase with this post. 

And trust me, I think they're out of control and silly and dumb with their money too and the sub is terrible anytime a meme stock goes up 10%, but yeah. Keep shaking your fist old man.

I have friends who work in fed govt, one thing I know unless there is a major screw up they always renew contracts and increase budget by set percentage to adjust inflation every year. That's not just for pltr, its for every god damn thing. Once there is an expense entry in their books, its never going away.

As to future prospects, pltr got a good footholding because of covid tracing in lot of countries and this will only increase and provide chance to cross sell, up sell.

I use Schwab  but planning to switch to ameritrade.   So many stocks with Schwab are non marginable and I ended up day trading them a bunch of times so now my account is restricted from day trading stocks.  For whatever reason I can still day trade options so being kicked off stock may have been a great thing as my win days have gone up huge. Yesterday I was being kinda stupid and revenge trading.  Sometimes I put on as much as 50k of call or put premium.  But I never hold onto my idea if the market is smoking me.  Well sometimes I have and lost.  That's why I find choppy trade so frustrating. I sometimes expect the range will open up and go but then it just stays in a range and when I'm buying or selling momentum I'm being filled at awful prices to see no follow through. And then I worry about some big random move starting and so I get out for a loss. And when your trading size that loss can be substantial even if 20 to 30 cents.  Then when your frustrated you say fuck it I'm not going to get out it's just chop and then it turns into a bigger move and you get totally screwed.   My normal premium size on tsla would be 10 to 20 contracts in the beginning of the week and more contracts possibly closer to options expiration day when the premiums are less.   I trade near the money options primarily.  Whatever contract has nice liquidity.

No one knows man, but just by fundamentals alone GME will go to 50-60. With the squeeze and it could go to mars even pluto

Welp, someone shit in your cereal.
OP is adorable but there is no way 1.8 million autists are going to have the discipline of a single entity like Porsche.

Like a lot of "reasonable" people I sold 1/2 at 130% gain and will let the other 1/2 ride because it's all profit. I did the same thing with Tesla. I did my part, my original investment got paid to me directly out of the pocket of shorts and now the rest of it is out there long so there may be a secondary squeeze if and when lord cohen can make this thing viable.
That’s roughly $160mm right now.

At $18sp my bet was that he would do that. 

I’m not sure anymore.
I also think that discussion threads would be useful. 

Yes people are doing well on GME, but there are so many other investing opportunities that aren't in the spot light on this subreddit.

Just cause we're retarded doesn't mean we need to be on the same mental loop of tickers.

Two things surprised the market. Demand: China had some serious issues with african swine fever recently but their hog herds seem to have recovered better than the world expected. They now need to feed them and that’s driving a strong demand. Supply: South America has been experiencing some droughts lately. (This no one could have predicted). If the droughts continue, they will affect their expected supply (which hits the market late winter, early spring) this has helped to drive the most recent rally. Only the CPP knew/knows the true scale of the Chinese commodities demand, everyone thought those pigs were sick/dead, and no one really knows what the weather will do.

I get that. I guess what I'm wondering is say for example the float of shares is 100 and shares shorted is 150 (to simplify things), where would the short sellers get 50 extra shares to fully cover? Does my question make sense? 🤪

I still talk to people on here but there’s less people to talk to. Probably a problem of perception, we don’t think anyone wants to discuss anymore so we don’t try lol. I’ve also been busy lately. Seen a couple people say this this morning though so hope is not lost

Anybody have MGNI or WFC? If you do respond and let me know what you think the price movement will be for the next 2 weeks. I figure the WFC dip will rebound in the 2 weeks but I never really paid attention to this stock at all till I bought calls yesterday

Yes but it slows the squeeze down. Which makes it likely longs will get bored and pull out, that’s what the shorts are hoping for. Tesla squeeze took a year, after shorts holding down the price for 4 years.
The future is now old man, we are the institution!! Feel free to join us.

Lol this guy has been selling libertarian death by government for years. That said history cycles so he will be right the same ways broken clock does
This.  Exactly.
I have watched this sub be manipulated by a number of rich cunts / investment funds posting they bought 1M in stock and getting the sub to pump the price. Frankly far more than insider trading this is the legal issue this sub faces; market manipulation.
I miss the old wsb where you could have genuine and interesting discussions on the daily discussion, now its just a bunch of smooth brain spammers
Nope. Not without knowing when the short contracts are due. My guess is it’ll be over the course of months and that’s based on the fact that it’s highly unlikely all short contracts are due at one time.

Great time to buy WFC leaps. When the Fed lifts its asset cap consent order the stock is going to pop. It’s been an enormous drag on the stock price. Recent article about Yellen pushing for the consent order to be lifted.
Those margin requirements won't affect institutional investors.

This requirement is specifically meant to deleverage the maybe 20% to 30% of shares held by retail investors.
If those people sold covered calls, then there's still not enough shares to go around.
I sold mine. I got spooked and offloaded like 10shares. I like the company but shots volatile.

While the US Market has gotten more efficient in the last decade, it's far from being a perfect market.

The inefficiencies in the market allow for arbitrage opportunities, and, to a degree, that's what allows hedge funds to make profits comsistently.

Comfortably? Probably just need to have the ability to save 20k a year and you could do it if you want for a night. It’d be like you’re willing to spend 5k on a vacation for the year and you use two of that for your one night. But to be honest you don’t really want to be that guy, i’ve known rich guys that play that card but most of the time people then just use them for the free drinks. Some girls might give you a chance but that’s 2k spent on just starting a conversation, and there’s way more efficient ways of spending that 2k for fun for you and for girls. Like if you talk to a girl and you guys like each other you can go to a world class restaurant for 500 and then rent a really nice boat for the next day for 1500. If you invite her to that she’s going to be way happier and feel more special than if you spend 500 on a super over priced bottle of vodka that 6 other girls are drinking. And you’re going to have more fun too since she’s not a gold digger that you couldn’t get along well with without money.
BB made a good acquisition, Cylance, to go from phone to cyber security. BB was trying to implement synergies with the Cylance acquisition. People are arguing the CEO has done nothing so far with BB. Whoever thinks you can successfully create synergies under 1-2 year without hiccups and burning through some cash is a retard. Plus the synergies are finally working out, and the hiccups are going away. This is primed for growth.

THIS is exactly what people need to know about the lockup. SNOW is a similar company and their lockup expired on Jan. 7.

I agree they closed some but not all. There’s more shorts than Melvin out there. BofA is also shorting to some extent. That’s why I said we’ll have to see the updated data. If they didn’t close there’s a good chance in my mind it’s because they’re being plugged by MMs who are also exposed huge on GME rn.

You have really done it this time... most of the bears are currently closet put holders/leveraged buyers, but you decided to buy 3% otm puts with only 4 trading days? Bank earnings are on Tuesday, and bond interest rates are marginally high compared to the last 6 months, so you may see some gains on a pull back in interest rates right before Trump leaves office.

Thank you for answering the question. Do you know any better place to ask beginner questions? There are Subreddits around investments, but they mostly discuss safe things like ETFs, not options.

No worries. Yeah it confused me at first. Tesla options are expensive but I think most people buy options for shares that are between ~10 and ~40. The closer the expiration date the cheaper so a lot of people gamble with short term options. Also people on here have a lot more money than sense haha
The question I’d raise is how many people are really following the call to buy or sell a stock. A change in language to make each call a hypothetical event and outcome would probably suffice, e.g “if everyone bought GME and held on to their shares, then this would eventually squeeze the shorts out of their position.” It’s not a call to action anymore. 😂

All of these (physical goods) can be bought online as well as in GME stores

True. The people who actually make money aren’t chatting in dailies. Most of these will all lose it all. Been the same since 2015 and I’d assume much worse now
I agree. But there is a legitimate case of instituion vs. retail. They work together in attempts to leave us holding the bag there is no reason we can't do the same. I don't have any ill feelings toward anyone cashing out a profit, but Melvin Capital is out of moves and can literally only hope that a mass exodus from GME brings their short positions back to a somewhat okay position. The longer and higher the GME price stands the larger the buy to cover action will be. There are more shares shorted for GME than available, and every single share bought and held above their short position applies the pressure for the squeeze. This isnt the first meme rocket I've ridden, but this is the first complex event that I believe will be in textbooks if it tilts in the right direction. My money is in GME right now just for the potential to tell people about this in 20 years instead of making a quick dirty profit from options. That Melvin Capital dude already has enough money to purchase the beach property surrounding his beach property so he has more privacy, while I just smile at the thought of cleaning away some old business debt. This is a culmination of the evolution of Robinhood. Introducing a larger number of retail traders to the market than ever before and showing that retail investors decisions are now something that people must account for in their trade strategy. Ironically, meming the shit out of a ticket can now have serious risks applied to anyone trading that ticker. Banks and funds can send out upgrades or downgrades in attempts to sway retail sentiment, but we can hold our own sentiment and look to our own oracles now. The uptick rule has just added a new level of stability to GME, their board changes have a legitimate chance of turning them from a brick and mortar dinosaur into a digital participant, and the price showed a strength last week that you usually don't see on a meme ass pump and dump.
They definitely are working to figure out how to take our money. The rise in noob investors is changing the way the market behaves (to some extent), but that can only last so long before their algorithms and manpower figure out how to capitalize on our predictability. We are not sophisticated, that does not mean what we do is random, it’s just driven by different rules than traditional informed investors.

Stay strong brothers. It's getting the attention from bigger players, finally. BB was trying to implement synergies with the Cylance acquisition. People are arguing the CEO has done nothing so far with Cylance. Whoever thinks you can successfully create synergies under 1-2 year without hiccups and burning through some cash is a retarded analyst. Plus the synergies are finally working out, and the hiccups are going away. This is primed for growth. Give it time and it will moon... No it will fucking leave this universe.🚀🚀🚀

They actually are a good company with significant catalyst to an increase in share price. Their business model has evolved beyond brick and mortar stores that give you $5 for a used game. I recommend reading into it. It's not unlike how Blackberry isn't a phone company anymore.

I don't know what everyone's goals are with their stocks. Probably selling when the squeeze happens to fuck over shorts even more.

This whole thread is a dumpster fire on wheels at OJ's reinauguration.

You can't engage in insider trading just buy saying "let's all buy!" on a public forum.

Also, you can't pump n dump in stocks traded on the NYSE without absolutely titanic amounts of capital that would *definitely* get noticed and investigated by the NYSE. But just to be super duper shure the mods curb stomp anything under 1 billion in market cap.

The fears of this forum breaking the law with illegal levels of retardation are vastly overblown.

[removed]
A call option is a contract to buy 100 shares of a stock at a later date at the specified cost per share + the premium of each share. 

So say you buy a January 30th 30$ call option that has a 0.65 premium. That means you will be paying 100 x 0.65 = 65$ in premiums off the bat and then you will be buying 100 shares for 30$ when the contract expires. 

The point of them is to beat the market, say that stock goes up to 35$ per share by your date. You will be buying each share at a 4.35$ discount(5-0.65) which would make you 435$ since you’re getting 100 shares. Hope this helped, good luck with it!

The money at risk in this squeeze isn't close to what was at stake with VW.

He also told everyone to buy BABa at $319
Yes. Short version is this:
Gamestop was a failing busisness plagued by poor managment, people shorted it thinking it was going bamkrupt but Gamestop managed to close unrpofitable stores and make something of a comeback and with 400 million dollars in long terms loans and 500 million dollars in cash they aren't going bankrupt anytime soon. Add in a charismatic figure by the name of Ryan Cohen who has invested over a third of his wealth into Gamestop who has previously competed and won out against Amazon and wants to turn Gamestop into an e-commerce giant focusing on higher margin items such as collectibles, PC parts and accessories and a lucrative membership program as well as deals with Microsoft, Sony and Nintendo for shared revenue on online purchases on PS units, X-boxes and Switches sold in their stores and you can now see a viable path to them becoming truly huge 5-10 years from now.

With the stock prize depressed by previous sentiment about the company it is and has been severly undervalued for months by now, although it is quickly rising in prize. Now add in that it has the largest % of its float (stocks avaliable for purchase) and it is ripe for a short squeeze,  an event where shorters have to cover their position by buying stocks because the prize increased instead of decreased, and you could have an explosive gain in stock prize for the company over the next few months, as well as long term growth should the company keep succeeding in its rebranding and transformation into an e-commerce company. 

I highly recomend the stock no matter if you are just looking for short term gains or a more long term investment.  Personally I am in it for the long ride but the short term gains certainly dont make me less excited for the stock. Cheers!

Even in that business model we foresaw potential disruption 5 years down the road by streaming gaming as a service. I don't get it, what am I missing?

Only if the we get some catalyst that triggers the MOASS! If margins are called, the smaller people with shorts will cover. Price jumps up, then other lenders will start to margin call the larger people with borrowed shares. This then steam rolls into an uncontrollable rise in share price. When we hit the apex of the point, we dump our shares!
Lmao just multiply by 2, easy money 🤡
You forgot the coupon code dumbass.
You join this sub, have no idea or awareness about what it is about, then try to preach to people about responsible investing.

I would rather lose my money bag holding than be as pathetic as you
The sub legit grows ten thousand users a day.
Options represent 100 shares of the underlying stock. The price you see is *per share*. It’s a contract to have the option to buy or sell 100 shares per contract at the strike price per share if the contract’s triggering prerequisites are met (being “in the money”). 

You should really, really, really do more research and learn about what financial instruments actually do before trading them. Asking for help on this sub on a basic concept like this is a recipe for being flamed to the end of the earth.
Hardly. I’m still holding my shares and plan to for a while.
On a macro level, you’re definitely right in pointing out dunning kruger and erring on the side of caution.

However being that this is the internet and how it enables echo chambers, the rules are different when addressing this sub.

So we know the big banks are making a shit ton of interest on these shorted shares.   Do anyone think that they may possibly extend the duration of the squeeze  and decrease the peak by not margin calling?  Margin calling would help us sell at peak prices. But delaying the margin call would bleed the shorts because of the high interest.
Or you can have a retarded orgy and sell Calls and puts while also buying deep OTM calls and puts to hedge against both positions while also buying shares

Hey there, you should watch some videos on options before you actually go and buy weeklies.

It’s absolutely absurd that they think a few thousand wallstreetbet peoples caused $800+ million in losses.

Sure people here took part in the movement, but it was going to happen whether we were here or not.  Fucking insane.

What is going to change?  Well when people with a lot of money lose and they have to explain to their funds who they lost, they’re going to blame retail investors.  FINRA is going to make it harder for retail investors to trade options, I wouldn’t be surprised if they raise the capital requirement to $10k or even $25k.
How can be genius when retarded?🧐

There was a squeeze wednesday - gamma squeeze which is in part a squeeze of put option holders indirectly - and straight up short squeeze. People talk about squeezing Melvin capital, but you can’t, they have puts. You can however gamma squeeze the dealer that sold them the options, but that already happened and can’t happen again except the reverse if the price falls (if they still have puts)

Short squeeze could continue but here’s the thing...most direct shorts are large institutions. They have risk management. You can’t margin call them easily as they’ll have 20-50 positions in an account and GME is just one of them. A lot of them who were in earlier probably covered, and there are likely a lot of new shorts some who are in the green. It’s true they pay large short fees that they can’t pay forever. But Wsb also can get squeezed as longs because a lot of people lack patience and others use otm call options that will decay at a loss if the price doesn’t rise. 

Anyway I think the flaws in reasoning are that the shorts can be squeezed to low short interest at which point wsb wins. In reality, the big win was this week and an additional win requires a lot more buying. And the shorts may just not cover, and even if they do, you’ll find more shorts.

It's because the people who dont like the idea of you doing DD, and not listening to their directions, are clearly up to something.
> Also makes the vaccine moot for the people who are dying the most from covid (elderly and frail). Strange.

not really, for many reasons. The worst age group was 65+ while "near the end of their life" could mean like 85+, that's a 20 year difference. Also the vaccine has a much higher survival rate than the virus, it isn't even close. Also also, the virus kills healthy old people who aren't frail and would easily survive the vaccine. 

On top of that, the vaccine provides (Eventually) herd immunity to those too old and too frail to get the vaccine, so they dont have to worry about getting covid because everyone else around them in vaccinated.

ALSO ALSO also, it isn't just survival rates, covid survivors have been experiencing (as of right now) semi-permanent/long term symptoms such as fatigue and lung scarring that don't occur with the vaccine.

I’d be willing to bet they sold the call options for under market value knowing the buyer wouldn’t exercise eod. Apparently that is an extremely popular way of placing a bearish hedge.       

Do you mind me asking specifically about self hedged ratios? Are self hedged options ratios placed by institutions usually 4:1?      

I’ve been trying to work on the ratio myself for more consistent gains using .60 delta otm options(low gamma) vs similarly priced puts with similar delta and gamma in the same stock or industry, and would be interested in hearing what ratios you often see when self hedging.
Honestly a blessing it hasn’t happened yet just a matter of time
I just wanted to add that despite all these hit pieces and downgrades, the short interest in pltr remains fairly low. If institutions are so bearish on pltr, why don’t they short it? That’s because they are waiting for lockup to expire so they can get cheap shares and they are trying to keep the price down before that.

Congratulations on not mentioning Biden or Russia one time.  

Palantir is about to get relegated to the dustbin of history.  They have no moat.  They have no contracts.  These dudes are just cutting an enormous paycheck at your expense.

This is a murky investment and it won’t get any clearer because that would only bring the stock down.  Some insider is going to buy a few million shares and you are going to just shit yourself with excitement.

The flat out truth is not only is Palantir garbage, but it’s easier to make your money elsewhere in the market.  Short term it’s lost its appeal.  And it’s *definitely* easier to make long money than parking it in this retarded investment.

You should absolutely not be trading options if you don't understand that an options contract is a contract to buy/sell 100 shares.

Hold off for a few weeks and learn the basics at least.

Also the argument that GameStop is exposed to brick and mortar retail problems.  Their average lease length is 3 years, they can close underperforming stores extremely rapidly.  🐻 can talk about exposure to shitty malls but it doesn’t matter due how GameStop handles leases.
Option contracts are usually for 100 shares. The options chains always show per share price. So 1 contract will be 100 times the price shown in the options chain.

People have so much money right now. It's just insane. If they all panicsell their stocks they'll raise trillions of USD in cash. Where's that cash going exactly?

They gonna toss it into Bonds? Money market indexes? A 10-15% correction on stocks would get bought up hand over fist. You might see some cooling off in the SPACs, IPOs, stocks with 1000 PE ratios, but do you expect people to sell off their big tech?

When people sell stocks they sell them for USD. USD is a depreciating asset that is being diluted at an unprecedented rate. It's also controlled by a central bank which is happy to print away any type of crash.

The real risk will occur when USD printing and stimulus results in high inflation and true loss of faith in the USD. Then you're in a real pickle.
That’s a pretty significant increase from my experience but unless you can put 20% down I think owning is not always better. Just IMO.. everyone’s situation is different

Yeah I was going to mention Tasty Trade founder developed "sizzle" years ago.  On TOS just sort on OI, Sizzle and Volume.  Whales pop right out. 

However it's the timing that's killer.  Whales know the why but not when. I wrote a script that plots sizzle with a Fibonnaci extension off price/ vol. VWAP and then set an alert to text my phone.

Why allow yourself to lose money is my point. Why plan for a dip, why not buy the dip...
Still seems hard to distinguish between someone celebrating a stock they own and trying to get others to buy it.

> Damn y’all I bought [insert stock] and I’m up 50% on the year! [Insert basic bitch level DD for why the stock is doing well]. Get in before we leave for the moon!

Are you suggesting something like this is illegal? I’m not a lawyer, so I’m genuinely curious.

Also, I feel like there are a lot of websites that offer “stock picks” which essentially do the same thing. Provide very basic DD and then tell you to buy.
I think I should've got calls on tin foil hats...

Might be some truth in it, but BB has been mentioned quite a bit for some time, and there's been some low key catalysts.

Don't know why it did blow up the way it did on Thursday, but I'm not sure there's a conspiracy.

Having said there, I'm seeing a lot more new account pump and dump posts generally recently, not just for BB (e.g. hot spacs)

I got a bad feeling about Tuesday... Fuck
When you are making memes about it and trying to get it trending and then it does, it artificially inflates the value of the asset because a hoard of people are pumping their money into one single equity at the direction of some figurative leader(s) online. Is it really hard for you to imagine that this is being done purposefully on the front end so that a subset of people can making quick money on the back end? Do you seriously for a second think that the SEC is going to continue to let this go on? You have nearly 2 million people subscribed to this sub, and that doesn’t include the entirety of Reddit when this shit hits the front page. You know exactly what I’m talking about and what OP is talking about, so stop acting like a fucking retard and don’t be surprised when this sub gets revamped or shut down.

I would look at BB and GME separately although some on this sub may not agree. A lot depends on your entry point as well. So let’s talk GME. 
Many on this sub believe GME has a lot of long term potential as they work to pivot into a more relevant company using a different business model than the past. This is something Blockbuster failed to do and it went belly up as Netflix became the mainstream way people rented DVDs and then moved to streaming. 
Those people who believed this have likely been owning shares of GME for a while at a lower cost basis than those who are here solely for the short squeeze.  You have to decide if you want to be a long term holder of GME and willing to ride out the upcoming volatility or are you looking to capitalize on the short squeeze only? 
If the latter then closely monitor the price in the coming days. Sell when you reach a point when you are happy with your profits. 

BB is in a different boat. There’s no short squeeze happening there. The hype is about the company being a good long term investment as they complete their transition from a cell phone maker to a software company that’s got its fingers in a lot of pies and one that holds something like 35,000 patents. This is one where news/announcements from the company will be really important in validating or debunking this hype.  So you’ll want to watch that news closely over the coming months/years to see how the company grows its revenue, customer, earnings, etc.
Everything sold off.
You tried to help them, OP, and I thank you for it. It's now time for the trolling...

This MOASS could be long and protracted like Tesla in 2020.  Keep in mind that at 1x sales, the share price should be $80-100.  Compare that with another retailer Chewy, which has a p/s ratio of 6-7x.  Pet products also has a much lower TAM than gaming.  

This isn’t even factoring in a complete turnaround that RC has to be planning.  Look at the newest board composition.  Newest members are Reggie (my body is ready), the head of cloud 9 esports, and the current president Petsmart and Chewy. board member.  Ask yourself, are these the people that would join the board of a company that is expected to die in 5 years due to digital game sales.  The digital game sales argument, like all 🐻  arguments, are weak.  The shift to digital will possibly occur in the next console cycle.  So maybe the 🐻 are right, but they’re right in 8 years which means they’re wrong now.  Additionally digital sales growth has decelerated and are returning to pre-covid levels and more
people go back to stores.  Also, game publishers don’t care about the fractionally
larger margins from selling digital direct.  They only care about moving as many units as quickly as possible.  If they could sell the games on floppy disks they would.  Go read the public filings for any game publisher and they will tell you that they only care about selling what customers want and guess what, they still want physical.  Look at how many Red Box locations still exist.  Blockbuster died because Carl
Icahn got involved, killed
Blockbuster’s attempt to pivot to a Netflix model and Blockbuster’s old business model relied on late fees.  Red box offered the same thing as blockbuster in a consumer friendlier format.

I could post more and make this a deviated post but I’m too fucking lazy.  This has moved beyond a short squeeze yolo to a long term hold.  If RC succeeds in transforming this into the next chewy, you’re looking at a 20x multiple.  This is based on fundamentals and industry tailwinds.  I added 10k shares weeks ago and added 20k shares at $38 because this thing is going much higher and idgaf about a few bucks in share price right now.  Also don’t attempt to time the market because you could be left behind at the launchpad.  

TLDR:  30k shares at $32 cost basis.  Thing will moon and continue to moon if you believe in RC.
XD
why is databricks considered way more successful?
Well, to be fair, it DID hit 40 by EOW. 

Also GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I actually made a post about the VW short squeeze just to teach people about what actually happened. That being said, they're not all that similar because there's no single entity secretly amassing all of the shares.


But at the same time, there aren't 1% of shares available - VW wasn't shorted over 100%. And you can't really quantify a significant number of retail investors who are buying at literally any price because we have no idea what risk tolerance is.


So different situations, probably similar results. GameStop might not become more valuable than, say, Tesla, but the stock price will definitely rise dramatically sometime soon.
I’ve had my shares since, $11 per share and my autistic mind thinks Ryan Cohen is going to surpass Elon Musk. Meaning we’re going to the fucking moon! 🚀🌕 $1000 per share!

Fkn noobs
I appreciate your insight but I think there are some points, that I may be wrong about, that we need to consider:

\-Shorts have to return the shorted shares to the lender at some point. The higher the SP goes the worse it gets for them. GME is still at $2b but it makes around $7b in revenue. With RC this company can get to a MC of $10b especially in this market where every company seems overvalued compared to it's income.

\-Some brokerages have already eliminated the margins on GME. 

\-We are at a point that short sellers of the 5-15s will NEVER make profit. This is a fact. There is no way this thing gets below the 20s again. It'd be completely absurd to think so. Now, we are "only" at $35 SP, but you have to take into account that the forward momentum is on for GME, credit ratings have improved and will very possible be improved in the next quarters given that the console demand is insane and at around April the shortage should be no more which means great sales. Once this company shows signs of a turnaround in the balance sheets, funds and big players will want to get in. So this thing is only going up from here, maybe not to anything crazy but it's going up. Right now there is still a lot of speculation on a fair SP, but when they actually prove that this new valuations are justified? That's when the money really starts to flow in this stock. Are short sellers going to keep waiting while the SP raises? I really don't think so. Why lift this thing from the from the moon to mars when you can lift it "just" from earth to the moon? It's in their best interest to cover before an actual turn around in the company and not just in the hype around it, which is where we are now.

I'd love to know what you think even if I don't agree with you :)

I guess if the market cap is 2.58 now. Then (6/2.58)x35.5 = 82.5$ and (8/2.58)x35.5 = 110$
So from 82.5$ to 110$ he expects it

Was looking at this when i read about the merger.  I was surprised to see the apha price not keeping up with TLRY but then figured i would make out pretty well the further apart they got due to arb.  I suppose they could adjust the ratio though.  I also wonder how long people will keep buying into weed stocks pumping the price up.
32 @ 8.61 and 1 call.  We're in this together.

They've already made progress. "Greed premium" is up and only increasing. Whenever people talk about IV being too high, that's because MMs are pricing options well above what you would expect from most options models. Look at how options get priced on meme stocks, IV wayyy above actual price action. You're spot on though - this is just the first tool, they're only going to get better at it.
God, you boomers had it so easy back in the olden days
Or 3) Because there is a vesting period
Serious answer: 100-160$  thats a +-400% gain, but no one knows. Also this can take weeks or days. The thing is everyone is using the VW scenario to say that it will happen to GME. In the VW scenario the company bought all shares sneaky and there was only 1% float. This is not the case for GME. The squeeze will hapen and it did not start for the mayor shorts. My guess it will take weeks.

Pray to god you don't drop that shit
I really enjoy some DD's and it helped me a lot to get some good trading ideas but what I miss here is that no one talks about the risks involved. Imagine being a first time investor and get burned because you bought the peak of a hype stock because everyone in this sub told you that the stock will moon. But in reality the hype is over and everyone jumped to the next stock while the new people are bag holding and hoping that someday they can pass their bags to someone elese. The truth is, nobody knows really what will happen. Of course everyone should do their own research before yoloing their rent money but some posts are really misleading and then you read how everyone in the sub is jumping on it, people who criticize the DD get downvoted immediately and you end up in a circlejerk.
From the post the instinct to do this is rooted in “whales” buying a “shit ton” 

Honestly for this sub it’s some pretty strong DD

Thanks for sharing. I’m a newer investor. I’ve spent most of my time in ETFs and Index funds. 

I think the long term aspects of PLTR look good. Short term is questionable depending on lockout. They seem to be winning contracts and doing good business from what I can tell from
my full fledged retarded view. 

I bought 2.5K worth of PLTR stock this past Friday after hearing about it on this sub. Looking at available info on the google machine, I thought it was a good risk as the company is projected to start turning a profit and the lockout and earnings date will hold the price down. Once the lockout/earnings report plays out I think this stock has nowhere to go but up. Too many upsides. You have proven people, expanding niche market that has the chance to go big time tech. They seem to be winning contracts and doing good business from what I can tell.

This is my view as a full fledged autist of course. I hope to have 💎🙌 in the long term.

Stocks value to those who care about fundamentals based on several valuation methods but all attempt to capture the sum of future cash flows in some way. If a business is in decline you price down a lot because the future time series has decay. 

I find there’s a lot of contradictory logic on gme. People seem to want to simultaneously value it as value, growth and a short squeeze thesis. It’s mostly a value thesis in terms of long term investors who would take the shares who aren’t on wsb, and these prices are far beyond a value thesis. Most turn arounds fail, even with the right management, because turnarounds are hard and they are impossible if your industry is receding.

No one really knows. Parabolic movement is completely possible. Share price jumping in $5-$10 increments is possible. 

It all depends on what the brokerages do and when they do it. 

If this develops slowly, which was true until Wednesday (even though Wednesday was not the squeeze) it certainly moved up the time line and accelerated the speed. 

Tuesday will be very telling what happens next. 

We could see a share price as high as $60 before the squeeze even begins. 

For reference a $420 share price is a $20bil market cap. So not out of the question at all in an infinity squeeze. 

Remember this is one of the worst short squeezes based on the math we’ve seen.

My unqualified opinion? 

$100 share price is inevitable when the squeeze starts. 

Anything above that depends on how the market makers, the brokerages, these paper handed bitches, and the SEC reacts. 

My personal price target is $300.

Damn ur saying my 500p's for March are actually Mega Millions lotto tix?
im using 3 brokers now, imma give my autistic opinion on them to help u tards decide if u wanna ditch RH...which i strongly advise

1-TDA: top class, very reputable, plenty of good learning videos, TOS platform looks good on pc and ipad but look like shit on phone (there will be learning curve using that platform), good research material abt investment stuff, good customer service (have a number i can call and reach human with no weird accent in no time and have chat option too), options not free (65c per trade), can open cash account n margin acnt, this is my main accn

2-MooMoo: funny name , app based only, very rich TA tools like charts/graphs, can look intimidating at first but its not that hard to use, no phone number but they reply fast when u email,  app looks very good on ipad n phone, can trade HK n CN market, margin account only (cant cash). i use this app to fool around on the phone...like buying gme 1/15 49c on 1/15

3-webull: best looking app, quite simple to use,have desktop and web platform too, no phone number to call, can have cash and margin account, active msg board. I dont have much experience with it yet but it has the best papermoney trading tool  compare to the other 2 so i use it for this purpose.

Note about cash account significance: u can day trade without limit no matter how much cash u have in the account.  day trade meaning buy n sell stock/option in the same day. margin accn will limit 3 in 5 days or u get restricted unless ur account has 25k min value.

Earliest I've heard it could happen is second half of this year. Want to hedge against that? IIRC the S&P has risen 7% on average every year with crashes.

The big problem with crashes is they happen when people want to retire and pull that money out. The market comes right back up some time after, a couple years or so?

I was worried I missed the train buying at $35 with $1k but since you bought 800 shares, I don’t feel bad. That’s how this sub works right?
I'm not sure that posting on an open forum, and keeping fingers crossed in hope that others will do what you'd like them to do constitute an insider trading. Peace.
I have no idea what I’m doing and it’s been years.
I doubt most of them will be unarmed. If it happens, it will be bloody.

Fuck it’s going to be a long weekend. I had a nightmare that Tesla crashed down to $150 😱
Canadian here, too. Gonna jump on the GME train. Waiting 3 days to transfer funds sucks! Glad Monday is a holiday in the states.
Share gang never loses
He has roughly 5% in GME I believe, trimmed position a few months ago. Its still a very large position.
Hey dumbass. Go fuck yourself and unsub from here
I filled the survey. But. I personally hold 250 shares. I Own additional 200 bout on x5 leverage. This means I do not own 450 shares since 200 are CFD. My broker has to leverage our contract but I have no idea how many shares they buy to cover the contract. I filled 450 shares but I am not sure if that was a right decision.
This was incredible. Thank you
Hold this isn't a week trade in and out.
Got one share of underarm our, thanks for the tips
So has anyone actually managed to get PS5/Xbox here?

BB ain’t done! $15 next week!
I agree and that’s how I would see it. But let’s face it, I know but a sliver amount of what other possible reason and effects to execute it would be.
I think our minds hope for it for the possibility of short squeeze with minimal impact for us, while GME getting a little cash. But also don’t forget these guys have to keep running the company after said squeeze happens. So they may have a little different of a plan for when or how much, or even at all.
Obviously keep it, ignore swings, dont look at it for months unless you need the money.

I should say that my 50 floor and 75 ceiling was before the two days of rally—now my brain can accept a higher range, but still in the 75-125 range. This isn’t based on much of anything—just an unlearned intuition thinking on what’s “reasonable” (in an unreasonable market).
Hi Cramer 👋
I remember the first time I heard about the Dunning-Kruger effect

Funny thing is OP is full blown Dunning-Kruger; acting like they’re enlightened and teaching us serfs
15-27 really old people with major preexisting conditions dying isn’t gonna do shit to our markets
Most clients don’t have GameStop or any major bank or credible hedge fund as an investment check the holdings ...just brokers looking to make premium of the trading of shares to retail ...come back at the end of the month we will see
Just went and watched it, wow
Monday is almost always green and if not Tuesday is green and allows you to get out. I always hold over the weekend
I'm looking on openinsider.com to look at which insiders are selling their shares but how can I tell if a sale is mandatory due to regulation, pre planned due to an agreement or a spare of the moment selling the top kinda sale?

Take KTOS for example https://i.gyazo.com/c12f2f58af6a22218e8412c550132145.png
Under trade type it just says Sale, or Sale+EO.
You guys are fucking idiots.
Melvin, this is a Wendy’s. And no not stupid but majorly retarded. Now shut the fuck up with that insider trading nonsense. Your wife’s boyfriend told me GME TO THE FUCKING MOON. Now do you want spicy or regular trendies with that jr. frosty?🚀🚀🚀

Good morning
That’s insane. I’m surprise RH didn’t take legal action. Just banned the accounts lol.
One year timeline fair enough
Big gay is attempting to drive the price down, scare off the holders into selling and minimize their already massive losses.  They have to make this work perfectly or they are fucked.  

Our job is literally the easiest job you could task someone.  Hold.  Don’t sell for anything less than 420.69

Paper Trading
Like stocks, if you hold it only goes up
I just want to say that, this fucking sub is bonkers. In the best way. Everyone here is crazy as shit and willing to bet thousands for the memes. I fucking love it. There’s so much good info here aside from that too.  I think it’s in this subs best interest to have some sort of backup in place, because how hard would it be for a big institution to get Reddit to shit this shit down? It was all lulz and games for the longest, but if this place starts making serious waves in the market, no doubt someone’s gonna try and do something about that
If he could think of a way for it to be self enriching he would have done it already.
Everybody on this sub needs to read this, especially with the influx of actual morons who know nothing. There's a reason we tell each other not to get left holding the bags.
Anyone who thinks bb is a week trade is thinking wrong
You couldn't be more correct. Eveything there is to find about this company is awesome, yet it's only at 5.5B market cap. 

The volume is weird imo too, as well as us wsb'ers randomly picking it up roughly at the same time. I agree that this volume can't be us. There is however quite a probable explanation: BB came in the media a couple of times with positive news: Amazon partnership (huh wait what BB is in another industry than phones; EV's?!), Patent selling (huh wait what BB no longer sells phones?!), Facebook settlement (huh wait what BB no longer sells phones and has balls of steel?!)

People are realising it's no longer the very good phone company that lost market share, it's now the very good company that does cybersecurity and is part of the EV supply chain.
Just a short link that shows the potential GAINZ 🚀 to be had if this short squeeze is successful. All we have to do is buy & hold. At any price. It doesn’t matter. All we have to do is wait out the contracts of the put orders & the shorts will follow.

a Wallstreet fatsack is shortselling a company with sound fundamentals and we are just buying shares of said company. how is what people here are doing manipulating? its literally some / r/ investing stuff we do here lol
Gotta start somewhere.

Those are my thoughts
after the sea of red last week, i'm sure the ending of the world has been priced in - fellow autist.
"You are out of your mind if you think GME will be over $15 and time soon"

I agree with you but I have learned in the last year nothing works how it used to and stock jumps do not happen because of fundamentals anymore.

Anything can happen in the Matrix.

I’m all for an actual GME squeeze and am still holding shares, but I think people need to realize that most of the people who made gains have already sold and moved on to the next thing.

The biggest mistake people make on this sub is thinking that this is any different than sitting at a blackjack table wherein the idea is to play YOUR cards to YOUR advantage and that’s it. You don’t play in a way that ensures that the guy sitting next to you can win as well. 

Your moves are your moves, and their moves are theirs. That’s the reality of this game.

Most of africa is and has alwaya been dirt poor. Some parts have great natural resources, but the vast majority of the continent was conquered with no good reason. 

All their "wealth" was stolen by europeans, more than 70 years ago now. Much like ex-socialist countries that got their economy destroyed by communism. Yet those stand on their feet more or less, while africa continues being africa and enlisting child soldiers and raping through the boring days.

😂😂😂 this is the most retarded boomer article I've ever read. 

He literally says RC is in for 13% and 3 board members (ignores potential +7%), references S3, experts in tracking short interest who clearly stated SI is still insanely high and the squeeze has NOT happened. Then completely ignores it all and says 

- 'price will go down'  - 'why? ' - 'some guy said'. Absolutely no narrative, no dd, no news. At this point these articles are just long confirmation bias. 

All in.

In short (no pun intended)... we're making money, they're losing money. That's it.

In this particular situation: establishment investors (Melvin and other similar firms) are short selling this stock because it's a bubble. The hivemind of retards that is WSB just happens to have more capital at their disposal than them, driving up the stock price, costing Melvin et al a lot of money. This situation extends beyond GME and into the boom of so-called retail investors, which is contrary to the status quo.

You are right but it’s like the stars aligned for that. I never have at that much money at any point in my life. I get it though, when you look into the past, you can draw as many lines as you want and call it destiny. Doesn’t mean a thing
I make about 200k/yr and after covering my hemorrhaging rental property mortgages, stoopid ass expensive car that keeps breaking down, and insatiable love for sushi, I could do this probably once a month or so tops. So if you don't care about investments or cars or food, easily once a month on around 100k/yr
The concern is not info leakage/insider trading, it's market manipulation, as OP rightly pointed out. 

When some retard says "PUMP IT" that's potential market manipulation and super illegal. 

In the UK, the FCA even outlaws "attempted" market manipulation (even if you don't succeed in moving prices). The regs take this shit super seriously and so do the banks that brokers like E-Trade and Robinhood route order flow through. Just read the news about JPMs latest fines, don't kill this retail investor surge by being ignorant to the rules of the road.
This is my biggest question, but I don't think anyone has THE answer, it's impossible to guess. What is certain is if the squeeze happens, it's gunna go above 100. 

Personally I think it depends on what you're happy with.

It could absolutely moon to stupid prices like 420.69 but if it 'only' moons to 150 and you don't catch it would you be happy? I've personally set my TP to a value of 200 per share, and a price alert at 80, which I'll then raise in line with the growth at the time. 

I'd set a reasonable price target, and be ready to remove it if the stock looks like it's going to blow past it. At that point, you sit there looking at candles until growth slows/retreats and/or you can't bear waiting anymore and sell there.

tldr?
Just think about it...would you have REALLY held those until their literal expiration? There's NO way I would have because at a minimum I would have eventually hit a point where it just seems incredibly risky to leave every contract open. Maybe I would have left one or two alone.

I truly hope anyone who hits it that big does well with their money but sometimes I wonder how many end up fucking blowing it by mismanaging their money

Lol I'm on the can reading this now
This is the way.
So what’s the point? 

Can brokers force a sell of shares in clients 401k, IRA, and holdings of their clients when shorts have to cover? Do clients not have to hit the sell button?
You and the other guy can’t hold two ideas in your heads at once. Blocked.

With the amount of retards pumping money into the market growing day after day how does a retarded investor bubble pop?
That’s what I mean yeah it’s a value offering, they would still get the 100m worth but at higher share prices it would take less shares to do it which I see being the better option than doing it now.
Lmfao what does the SEC shutting down wall street bets actually look like? All they would do is send a big flag to the world to copy what we have done on a larger scale. Meanwhile another trading discussion safespace will form.
Like most people, I intend to sell my contracts, if the stock price jumps up to $100. The contract will be exponentially high. I’m curious if anyone will actually pay the price to close out their position or just wait til the price drops back down
Can’t remember the ticker but one time people were freaking out about an insider sale and then we found out the dude was in a nasty divorce and was being forced to sell to give his ex cash.

better dump your tessler shares folks, dont worry Im a discount shopper
I sold two covered calls 27 and 27.5, may these print for the autist who bought it cus I dont mind letting these go. PLTR is an awesome company, but the stock itself trades sideways and I need more IV in my life for the premiums.

yup. but i have it hidden from displaying in Fidelity. it's just there in the background slowly growing year after year.

The dumbest thing you can do in investing is follow the “smart” money
I'm going to hold 100 shares for at least a year. 

I have 120ish, so if it has a big day or week I might sell a few off or sell covered calls OTM, but I'm going to try to hold on to 100 long term.

To me it feels like a stock that at any time could run to 50 or higher. Kind of like what we saw with FSLY (different companies for sure, but FSLY's price is all about future growth).  

They seem to be on a roll with getting business, and have a lot of potential growth, so I'm bullish long term.
Fill up my confidents bucket
No because it's in options and will likely go to zero (IRA, not 401k)

I’m just curious how algos will interpret such headlines. 

Also makes the vaccine moot for the people who are dying the most from covid (elderly and frail). Strange.

Gme offers stock in coming weeks to raise $$ for app developer. Deal with amazing coming in the next few months for subscription based gaming from tv. Price target of 70-85. 2021 will be massive for GME.
Then hedge?
The only thing that keeps me hopeful ✌️
[removed]
You're right, and the difference people are missing is the factor of surprise. VW happened very quickly and was unexpected. GME will happen very slowly and everyone already knows about it.

The difference is that Melvin will have time to do something about it. Hedge with calls. Unwind positions slowly. You can set a limit sell for $420.69, but if things never move fast enough for Melvin to get margin called, your order will sit. 

The shorts have to unwind 135% or whatever of float. Technically they can do that without ever buying your shares. At the opposite extreme of an infinity squeeze, it's theoretically possible to close their position with one share of stock that changes ownership a few billion times.

The short squeeze is a bonus. It's more similar to Tesla, where the short holdings exaggerated a climb that was going to happen anyway.
I saw a lot of words, some pictures with squiggly lines and no TL;DR and no position. 

So we’re going all in on GME right?
Just go full retard. No one is on the inside. It's all publicly available info. Don't pump stocks outside of actual info and we'll be fine. Basically, don't go full Trump and yall be fine.
Wow really? I thought it was the day of the largest amount of expiries. They were all reloaded too?

We do not belong to their club. Most of us arent trained or educated. We’re crass and ignorant. We are plebs. They are powerful and rich. And after 2020, news sources announced retail investors (that’s us) outperformed hedge funds. Egos exploded on the south side of Manhattan. Now Cramer announced we are straight up taking it to the shorts (big money) and they attacked so hard a sec rule was triggered. 

Op mentioned it in his post. They never intended people like us, the plebs, to be a part of it.

Edit: spelling
Gambling is based on chance first and foremost with very little skill involved. This isn't guessing it'll turn green because it was red a day ago. This is seeing a company as able to grow and looking behind the curtain to see that the people in charge also think so. Not to say there is zero chance involved, but it's like the people who pointed out we were due for a pandemic (every hundred years) and lo and behold, we got one.

Plus, if you don't at least make your savings rise about 3% year-over-year, then inflation is making you lose money. Just keep an eye on Gamestop. People are expecting a squeeze and it will drop as quickly as it rises.

Tbh I think a good amount of ppl on here think they are allowed to offer any amount of shares. 
If I’m not mistaken they are only allowed to get $100M worth. I think it would be smart for them to wait till around the $60+ range to keep the amount of shares down. 
I’m sure these guys are way ahead of us and know how to strategically execute this for best possible outcome. Or if it was a simply cash grab to help a failing company, I’m sure they would have done it a long time ago. Just my opinion though

Edit: can’t spell to save my life.

What’s you strike and expiry?
You will need to time it at the top, a good strategy but will be crazy expensive.   No one in their right mind will be willing to sell a put during an infinity squeeze.  So you're sttike choices will be very limited.

Second, it says it's safe for all be the frailest of patients who died as a result of known, common, symptoms of the vaccine such as fever. It goes on to say that the Norwegian medical agency isn't alarmed by this, and that people who are frail or are near the end of their life need a person-by-person assessment to see if the vaccine is right for them, which should be happening anyways.
Fun fact avg covid-attributed death age in Norway so far is higher than avg life expectancy
There is a  speck of shit telecom company based out of CT with a $41M market cap that just got approval for its chapter 11 restructuring, and they managed to wipe $10B in debt out. fucker used to be a dividend darling and I made a good amount of money on puts all the way down through 2017 and 2018. Now a days it's traded OTC I am thinking about throwing $1,000 at it on Tuesday morning just for funsies. I still believe there will be some consolidation in the Telecom sector and this could be a good candidate. if i'm wrong it's only a grand. Ad this is what happens when i decide t quit drinking.

Maybe, but I do think the play was obviously buying Jan/Feb calls back a couple months ago when it tanked after earnings.  

I had some FEb calls that I bought late summer, early fall that printed a little bit and I sold but I should have held.  I think they were 65c but I can't remember for sure.

My suggestion would be to get calls dated out at least 4-6 months that are close to ITM.  Do that on a dip.

Less volume means there's less shares being traded and therefore it's harder for shorts to cover. So a lower volume would be better.

I shit my pants whenever GME drops 1%
Fa>!b!<
Fuck FB, FB can burn in hell.
There are a few firms with 10% or more of the shares of GME.
to use BB as an example (i'm completely inventing these numbers):

say BB is at $10, and you buy a call option for $3.50 with a march expiration date. you will pay $350 (3.50x100) for that. That gives you the right, but not obligation, to buy 100 shares of BB for $10/each on or before March of this year.

If the share price is below $10 it's utterly worthless, and if it's below $13.50 it's not worthless but still you lost money on the deal overall. When buying this call, the max you can lose is the $350 you paid for it.

If BB is at $20 in march, the call will theoretically be worth $10 (the difference between 10 and 20 is 10, x100=$1000). Thus you've turned your initial $350 into $1000. Pretty cool. But, if it's worth $9, you get nothing. If it's worth $12, it's worth $2 (aka $200), which means you didn't completely go bust but still lost $150 on the deal.

In this last case (it's $12 in March) spending $1000 on shares would have netted you a 20% return, whereas by buying a call you lost $150. As with everything in the financial world, there's a risk/reward at play - options are greater risk with greater reward.

Also be very cautious anytime you feel yourself having "strong conviction\[s\] that a stock will go up 100% in 2 months", as those generally tend not to play out. I hope it does, and if it did, owning a call option would be a great play. But if you're not experienced in trading options, please go easy until you understand your risk tolerance and how much you can afford to lose, because sometimes you'll hit big and all is right with the world, other times you lose it all and spiral into a void of self-loathing. Happy trading :\~)

Glad someone remembers that old thread! [Here's a mirror](https://old.reddit.com/r/test/comments/69oqnc/gamestop_is_about_to_skyrocket_and_im/) if anyone wants to read it.

The post-Switch quarter didn't go over well, so I sold off my shares shortly after that. After accounting for dividends, I came out roughly even. Kinda anti-climatic, I know.

Since then, I've made a few good plays like Beyond Meat (+102%), Shake Shack (+99%), and Unity Software (+117%). I also bought shares in three airline stocks right at their lowest point in May, which I plan to cash out after a year for lower taxes.

Besides the meme plays, I've mostly stuck with boomer ETFs and general wealth building. Gamestop will always hold a special place in my heart though.

(Also, I'm really kicking myself over selling AMD at $3.50, as if that fact weren't already painful enough three years ago.)

When i look at far OTM leaps for companies the price is really high, PLUG for example has 2022-01-21 100C going for $1760.

Why was the price on your leap so low, and was this expensive relative to lower strike price TSLA calls at the time?

In retrospect a .31 price looks like a steal.

Thank you.  Learned a little I didn’t already know.   My question is- if you are this confident, why not get the Jan’23 $50 calls?  They will DRAMATICALLY outperform the shares

I was still up on the 1/15 calls $400 profit, which isn't much and a massive loss from where it was but you have to make sure you choose options with good value, less damage when the price crops, and has as low time decay as possible.

However, **this time we actually have news and Tesla breaking into a market that was controlled by only about 3 companies**, two of the biggest mention in this thread, as well as new price targets. Just because last week burned some of you doesn't mean this week won't soar\*\*, l**ook at what all the hedge funds are doing, they know it's shooting this week doubling down on positions by adding more.**

We only going up yo. \^\^\^\^\^\^\^\^

Fuck them in the ass, I'm buying more shares next Tuesday
I had a 52$ put that I cashed out on Monday, now I have fomo 🤣
Spamming daily discussion threads with "NOOOO DON'T SELL X" because my position is cratering like that'll be enough to reverse the trend.
Done. 5500 shares.

Perfect, Bill.
I have the right to exercise the contract and purchase the shares at a fix price. We are on the same side.
$1M into the co1n that shall not be named here, might buy more. In my $25k portfolio I have CGC, CRSP, AMD, AAPL, DIS, TWTR, DDD

You own the shares, not the money you “bought” it with. Since you own the shares it can be lent again. However, since you’re retarded, they margin call your bitch ass for the money you owe. Now you will not own the shares and will owe the money.
Look at the squeeze that happened to VW stock...   the highest amount happened pretty quick.  There was time after that to trade in the triple value range though..

I can lose money all on my own, I don’t need your help.
I believe he helped us by bringing up attention to the short squeezes that are just waiting to burst.

Short interest on GME as increased friday, I believe it's because whales got insulted that he said we are succeeding "beyond our wildest dreams". Us, a subreddit full of retards dropping their Wendy's paycheck in meme stocks. They tried to bluff us, but they underestimated the power of WEAPONIZED AUTISM and are going to pay for it.

It drove the price down a bit sure, but it also got rid of all the paper hands and allowed thre real 💎🙌 to double their holding at a smaller price. Now they are going to pay for beeing dicks. The stock price dropped only by 11%, that's nothing compared to the 130% increased we have seen in the last week. That's even less when you count the fact that some of the drop was caused by the 3 leaving directors selling a bit of their shares.

TL;DR: 🌈🐻 tried to fuck us after Crammer gave us a shoutout. They shot themselves in the foot right before lift off. GME TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

1/22 is a gamble to be honest, NO ONE can tell you what that price will look like.

Its a waiting game though, but you have a good chance of seeing that print to be honest.

Sure, more shares do get bought overall, but if we're expecting GME to moon (or at least get into $75+ territory), then you'll be significantly limiting your profit potential by doing short puts. You can probably cause more shares to be bought by doing short puts vs buying shares, but the profit from those shares will go primarily to MMs, not you.
Did you ever find those atvs?
If you read the form it explains why the shares were sold (green text under Explanation of Responses):

It’s like when ARKK has to sell TSLA when price skyrockets because they don’t allow any stock to exceed 10% of funds value.

Curious as to others view on this.

Let’s say GME exercise their shelf offering at around 75-100, a slight dip would be expected yes but would we say the price will still moon after? As it’s just a value offering and obviously the higher the price the less diluted the stock becomes but I just want to hear others input on how they see it effecting a squeeze?

Prayin, but man, consider cutting your losses. Do some DD. Friday is at the end of a 4 day week, and a very volatile week at that. Tesla hasn't seen such a drop in a while, and it signifies the end of the meteoric rise in all the paper hands. If ever there was a sign for the bubble popping, this is it.
Bruh just have your girlfriend trade for you, family member, or friend that you can trust. Have them take out cash from the bank in small amounts and give it to you so there’s no paper trail. Use that cash to load up reloadable debit cards from Walmart and you’re set. No connections and you still win.
But the legal version, not the criminal version
Yeah, some people choose the wrong strikes last week so lost more money then they should have, but that's what you get for choosing strikes with enormously high volume EVERYONE ELSE is buying. I was still up on the 1/15 calls $400 profit, which isn't much and a massive loss from where it was but you have to make sure you choose options with good value, less damage when the price crops, and has as low time decay as possible.

However, **this time we actually have news and Tesla breaking into a market that was controlled by only about 3 companies**, two of the biggest mention in this thread, as well as new price targets.

$40 the highest for GME I meant.

Options is so confusing.....

I’ll just stick with buy low sell high regular stocks...
Ironically the Sharia forbids short selling along with CFDs, futures and swaps.
It’s not unreasonable. It may sit here and consolidate for a while before moving up. As long as it consolidates above nine in the coming days, very bullish.
[removed]
Yeah people will paper hand, cause a dip like VW right before the big spike, then short interest goes down to say 102% still a huge amount and now are getting margin called because all shorts are under. VW and GME are not identical in terms of short interest and what institutions/people are holding them but it appears clear that this week was not the peak.
I’m in on that one. Currently up over 500% only holding stocks. In a few years no one will talk about plug being overvalued back in 2020/21. Never selling
The get a cut of every digital game sold on Xbox’s they sell. Come on man I can’t hold your hand through this. Read the DDs. They are now selling computer hardware and have like 60m pro rewards members. They are worth way more that 2.5 bn dollars, they have 600m cash on hand for fucks sake.
Naked call options sellers will have no choice but to buy 100 stocks at the current price whenever it gets exercised and they get chosen to be assigned. Covered call option sellers would just lose their 100 stocks.

Credit due to u/Invisible0815 for helping me with this yesterday. Copy and paste below from his original comment yesterday:

wolf has a fund: hestia capital. of his total holdings (just an example) gme was 10%. now gme rises to 20+, maybe other holdings lose value, so now his gme is 15% of his total holdings. the rules of his fund now apply, because there is a restriction that he cant own more than 10% of his holdings in one stock.

numbers are just examples and not the correct ones.

Same I'm probably holding for awhile honestly.
If anyone doubts that hedge funds do this shady shit just watch that Cramer video from like 2006 when he basically is explaining how he and other fund managers manipulate prices.
$40? The $690 call cost me $2 ($200), split adjust it became $138 and each of the 5 are $2 /5 = $0.40. Option price Friday was around $700. 

700 / .4 = 1,750x

Dude are u manic?
People keep talking about a "pull back" or "correction" and none of them know if it would major or minor, just vague predictions.  My question to them is... what is your catalyst for this "feeling"?  We already had a major correction which had the virus as the catalyst last year in march.  With the big companies hanging in there and the world doing business throughout the plague, things have not gotten worse stock market wise.  If you look at stocks, there are plenty that are still below the highs in march before the plague hit.  Truthfully, the negatives i see are back rent ( lots of evictions perhaps ) and government debt.  However, to offset that, i see people recovering, small business recovering and all the corporate types who are hunkered down currently while working from home, spending TONS of money on vacations, live entertainment, eating out, etc immediately as each state takes the guard rails off.  If there is a decline, i would imagine its more sector based than stock market wide.
Responded to the total gains in percentages. Hope this is what you meant 🚀
Compare BB to the market average that day, not to itself. It did fine.
Market manipulation is still illegal.
It’s impressive you held through the February/March COVID meltdown.
Hedge funds don't give af about your money
Exactly. Imagine larger sell-off, what then? Where are you going to put that money? Back into the market when you realize that cash is losing value faster than your red portfolio
We will see. Bearish sentiment is growing, I´m still positive, though.
Daily Paper loss not actual. But the real loss comes from the fear of missing out. 💸💸🚀🚀🚀
The problem is that I really don't have an imagination of how the stock will move D: Do you think GME/BB will be strongly affected in Europe on monday? Should I just hold and see what happens when NYSE opens tuesday?

Set a reasonable stop loss. If it goes under 9 for example its okay to see and look for reentry. But BB has been very resilient actually. Most of the surge came on the backs of two market red days so the fade was predictable. I see a steady push to the 5 yr high from here. Try not to look at your account too much. Shares dont expire.

Employer gets to see all your brokerage accounts (otherwise you can trade against the firm and print money) and you sign contracts saying you won’t trade your own account except through the firms desk.

Let’s say GME exercise their shelf offering at around 75-100, a slight dip would be expected yes but would we say the price will still moon after?

The OP spent 1500 on a call. That is expensive. But he has now 1.5 fucking million. That is expensive also. If you wanto to be rich you have to invest into expensive things. There is a reason cheap calls are cheap.
I too felt a large discrepancy between the overall read and the 10x in 1 year price target lol
Not if it keeps going up 🚀

Q4 earnings are at the end of March and everything is pointing to a 2+ EPS for the first time in almost forever. Shorters will want to unwind before then at least a little. 38 to 40 is costing them a lot right now 45 to 50 will make some get liquidated.
Too late for GME, correct?
95-96 he was in the bulls in the middle of the second 3peat
How long did you hold this for??
Your attachment to money is gone. Fine something else to replace it with
The only regret I’m going to have is I didn’t buy more
Holding tan for life at the point. Bought in March and it's done better than my options ever could.
I mean if I made multiple accounts and got on here and pumped XYZ then sold out, yea, 100% go directly to jail. But if a large group of people get together and decided, collectively, to pull their money and buy a huge stake in a stock how is that different than a large institution buying a large stake in a stock?

Genuinely curious how that would be viewed by the SEC.
Bro don’t resist the future just makes you seem like a boomer

We are in uncharted territory of money printing globally.
Hi Melvin
Will it take 50 years or can we have it by EOW
I’ll answer: it’s because share lockup ends in Feb. and previously unsellable shares will hit the market. 

Remember me when you hit a mill and buy me a used Kia.
Car loans are my goals rn
We're going to the moon!! no diamond hands here!!! WE CONTROL THE MARKET!!
That's okay. When I get bearish I sell puts and get that safety buffer between my money and the price action. Its made the past half year much more profitable than trying to time drops with puts.
Very generous! Just know they’re trying it

Alright, thank you very much for answering it even though it was asked multiple times. I honestly hit send before using the search button, which was my mistake. Thanks for answering again.
Right so do we buy GameStop stocks or what then?
What were the meme stocks in 2017/18? Were there any significant ones other than TSLA? Im wondering how they've all done for long term holders
Yah, I didn’t get in but it was awesome to watch.  Hope it keeps running for those late to the party but very skeptical

Same goes for you lol. Blocked.
The lack of rockets on BB makes me change my mind
This sub’s quality fell off a cliff after the Stoolies and Portnoy. That is when the exponential drop in quality happened. The first couple Cramer mentions were manageable, as was the Bloomberg article, surprisingly. GME is a rare gem this place needed.
They dont warn against EV, TSLA and NIO to the moon
You can probably get to Georgetown, but it’s not just The Mall. I couldn’t get anywhere near Chinatown
No look at the buy volume.
I honestly think we break below 370 next week
I think people also forget that the ancillary purpose of government contracting @ DoD is to fund the next generation of tech during the valley between "innovative new idea" and "broadly viable on the commercial market".  For new tech, the value of those government contracts is gargantuan. If PLTR figures their shit out (which is *the* bet, IMO) and becomes huge in corporate america...5 or 10 years out, 25 dollars/share will seem insanely undervalued.
I fail to see the problem. Pltr and gme are companies and people post the moves to make. Just because you don't like to make money doesn't mean that others share your autism
I'm in.
Good stuff, but much too late. The people who think one company is "cheaper" than another because of share price are here.

How many comments on the cramer videos where the newfriends are saying "we are getting the recognition we deserve!" 

Id be less shocked if i saw someone stabbing their own eye out on the street. How self destructive can you be? These new people are radioactive.

We honestly need a play to go south and bury these guys. Hasnt happened lately
Beautiful
>the SEC will shut this down so fucking fast

Had a lot of experience with SEC enforcement actions? Tell us more.
All I saw RC ran chewy, which is fine, but GME can't be chewy? It has to be a better Steam.
This is intriguing
Looking at TSLA like....
Yeah, let me know when that actually starts being true. "Trade talks are going well" "Stimulus talks are going well" "Kodak is making drugs now"
What he’s saying is true, keep it in the back of your small brain and refer to it in a few months/2022 when shit could possibly hit the fan
I just pictured some dude in one of those cheap government windbreakers with SEC in big yellow letters on the back absolutely porking some poor intern over his desk grilling him about WSB lol 😂😂
First it was inverse wsb, then it was inverse the inverse of wsb, it is now time to start the inverse the inverse the inverse of wsb again. Inversing the inverse was working a little bit but now that we have a bunch of new people it’s time change it up yet again
Tbh, if anyone is trying to pump and dump, it's the gme gang. I got a couple of guys on here telling you to sell my BB options, which I had since December 21, and do the short squeeze for game. Which autistic cunt is going to buy my gme options and stocks after I I buy near ATH. Not the cunt who suggested I buy gme for sure.
Gotta watch premarket moves and see what price is then. Set your limit based on what you think a fewinutes earlier. 🚀🚀🚀

This is great great DD. My one question is how does the dual class stock play into stock valuation when common shareholders basically have no voting rights? I’m all in on Palantir, but this is literally my only concern.
Just checked plug. I'm actually up 3,631.53% in roth account. Only up 2,462.71% in trading account... Pro tip, have you guys heard about GME? It's this company that sells video games that you can buy cheaper digitally or on Amazon...
Yes. Using trading 212

Thats not insider trading

Insider trading would be if he suddenly bought tons of stocks before a major positive news would come out or sold stocks before major negative news came out

Selling most of your shares because they have skyrocketed is in no way insider trading

I don’t get why they are also saying sales will be down soon. Does he know how much a PS5 cost and the demand right now. Sony is going to flood the market soon and all the retail sites will increase sales, including GameStop.
Thanks to GME and BB, I'm officially debt free except for the mortgage. That's next.

Every medium or larger chinese company is legally bound to have a CCP cell in its structures. The amount of control CCP can have is debatable, but when Winnie the Pooh comes knocking, you better fucking open the doors or else.
So $40 / $1.5 is 27x, if OP’s $1500 x 27x = the amount is only $40,000. How did it end up in 3.5 mil?

So with options, the most OP can lose is $1500? Or if it goes the other way and GME doesn’t reach $40/share do OP have to pay 3.5 mil?
Also, Uncle Cohen does not exist, apparently...

Volume does not equal total amount of unique shares sold, if that makes sense.
Back in the day here Visa was the OG free money play.. it had a predictable pattern.. you’d buy calls a few months out.. watch it run up and sell them at like 200% profit.. wait for it to dip a few dollars and repeat.
Nobody tells me what to do. Nothing can keep me from my tendies.
I bought a 1/22 tsla call at close Thursday, dumped it 20 mins into Friday for a few hundo then grabbed a put and sold that 20 mins later for another 600.  Day trading tsla is dipping your dick in gasoline before heading to burning man but if you get away with it.....
The jeans run strong in your family huh

What a well worded mod response. I’m glad to have finally joined this sub after lurking on/off for months. Even at the bottom of the barrel, we degenerates are really trying to make something great.
Hmm yeah that makes sense. Always some pullback from profit takers after a surge.

Nah daily and weekly OTM calls do great in a pullback. /s

What makes you say that?
The fact he didn’t even mention that GME is one of the most shorted stocks in the market says something.

This kid is trying to hard to go against the crowd and doesn’t even know what a short squeeze is.

GME to the 🌕🌖🌗🌘🌑🌒🌓🌔
Thanks for the work mate.
In my opinion you have the choice between these options:
1. Buy under 25 dollar
2. Wait and buy after the earnings and the Soros story
It’s January. Google “January Effect”
How’s this a loss??
Good luck!!
Yes just like you said it would never go over 10$, or 20$. Looking at your comment history you’ve been wrong about every gme projection since. 

Bottom is 34. See you on the moon, in June.

It doesn’t help because it’s the same shares being sold back and forth, they have to find more shares than even in the market. Also a ton of the shares are locked into mass institutions and firms. I think roughly like 30% of the shares are actively traded back and forth. Kinda hard to cover over 100% of shares with that.
I’m long some of the 50c 2023 and don’t plan on selling this year

Ey bby, Wan sum fuk?
True. I was shitting on them a few weeks back but got a little bored on a slow week and dug into them a little. And yeah, 1) they don't actually look bad at all and seem quite well positioned for growth this year, and 2) they were low volume forever, then suddenly in December there is like 330million shares traded vs their usual nothing. 

As far as I'm concerned, they are too cheap and there are too many positive signs to not make a play.
This. Not selling until bb hits 100 billion
I wonder if they just died of COVID itself before the antibodies and stuff got fully working. I mean, the symptoms would be similar, but just to different degrees. Idk anything about medicine so this might be stupid.
So, I have this great deal, I'll sell you GME shares at $50 it's really a steal... Deal? Obviously a smart chud like you will take it

You know you’re a Trader when your first response to major news headlines is to think “how can I profit from this?”
The ratio is out and you could get some free tlry shares from it, but if the share prices freefall or go dowb you're still losing money so i wouldn't say its arbitrage as no profit is guaranteed.

I think so. BB is going to take out the 5 yr high of 14.55 in the near term.
One big key difference is that we are on the verge of several big technological breakthroughs (IOT, AI, 5G, Clean energy and on and on) as well as the age of the modern day retail investor.  Who gives a fuck what the institutions do. As long as rates are low and money is flowing, people will be investing.  And if the market crashes, I’ll just double down again!! Fuck the MM!!
This was a detailed and informative read. Thank you for writing it up. These are the best types of posts in this subreddit.
Wasn't that much yesterday
I love how when you’re looking at GME on RH it says “people also invested in BB and PLTR”
Have you actually read any of the DD on this sub you retard? Oh who am I kidding of course you haven’t. Honestly you come across as a complete moron, all these questions have been answered.
Yes
How many times do we have to teach you this lesson old man?

Hey look a new retard like me. I got 12 shares at 38 and am now having the exact same thoughts as you after loading up some more into my account
seems like everyone is gme or bust
I’m not sure I understand the question. A call option gives the contract holder the option to buy a stock at a given strike price. In order to exercise the option, the market price has to be over the strike price. 
Those who wrote the call contracts are legally required to sell the shares at the price on the call contract. They can’t wait to pay.  But we may be talking about different things.
Aapl is in the 27th

Yo how bullish are we on airlines and travel, since Biden said 100 million vaccinations by 100 days in office. Which at that rate would mean we're at 2/3rds by early summer.

Same brother. Up 60% and this is adding major cash to the call every day since Nokia even moving sideways is making money.
The volume has been insane the past few days. Curious how they factor that in.
We don't even really need a true catalyst. Shorts have been short for a long time now. If the MM's that are owed the shares decide they want them back, they could trigger a Margin Call on the shares and create that catalyst themselves.

That is what I am betting on with the Rod Alzmann tweet on Friday.
Buying shares isn't going to be necessary when BB starts bringing in the bacon with its self driving tech.

Except there’s more of a benefit than a loss imo; And most people who are focused on actually making money are gonna understand not to sell
If you rearrange the letters in 'Traders' what do you get? That's right. 'Retards'

Let's go retards!!!
Replace T'/T in the second equation with what you get in the first and then factor out the A'/A.
Bro, wtf. You don't even know what you are doing. You don't even see yourself turning into a true wsb degen. 

Set a stop loss of 20~30% on trades, when it hits your stop loss. JUST. STAY. OUT. You need to come up with plans on price targets if you're doing options. The market is manipulated and will burn you out with theta.

Took me over 7k of personal loss and over 20k in gains to figure that out. 

Come up with a plan, or keep risking it all for the tendies.

Bad, because the price would be less sensitive to changes in demand.
Went straight to the comments to ask the same thing
There was literally a post 2 days ago from a mod about what happens if we get shut down.
Correctly, a mass covering of shorts would probably only happen by margin call and brokers covering for them. Which they can do.
Cuz all roads to 69420 go through 888, by 1.21.21
Because I'm not retarded enough to be active. WSB come for the stock tips, stay for the entertainment while lurking. And now lurking isn't even fun. Have you heard about GME. You should buy in at the top...
No joke. Had a dream I threw all my money at GME and 5 minutes later it went to $200. This seems healthy.
Lmao man how old are you?

You would have to force the shorts to cover first. Also the public would look at it as dilutive possibly causing more shorting and allowing the shorts out easy we have the rockets aimed right at melvins arsehole right now. For the time being they should work with available liquidity and cash flow. Once the market as a whole buys in to the turn around they would be much more amenable to an issue like
Tesla.

If that’s the future of the Democrat party I’m a bit scared bc it’s uber left in there. “THis SuB iS FoR CiViL DiScUSsiON” in the pinned section, then anything but happening in the comments

I feel my body has no soul on weekend mornings.
All shorts probably not collectively covering unless margin calls start going out?
Shut the fuck up dude. Yes it’s blatantly illegal in every sense but it’s hella fun. It’s the only fun there really is nowadays. So let me commit my felonies in peace please.
Blowies at your moms house
Options. $690 call back in 2019 was like $1.5 - $2. This is when TSLA was like $200 or so. Now TSLA is over $4,000 (split adjusted). A 20X gain in a stock is crazy, but with options the percentage goes even crazier. I bought the same options the OP had.
No, I’m sure they’re very smart, and they sold half their position.  You’re either buying or selling, can’t do both at the same time.  Buying drives price up, selling drives price down.  The smart ones (which we agreed) are selling right now.
God. This is the type of constructed argument I like to see on here. Clearly, GME is a once in a lifetime bet that will make us all a shit ton of money. That’s why were all talking about it! The shorts are fucked and a PT of 420.69 is absolutely reasonable.

You can try but ultimately they are going to pay the market price. For example, say you set a sell order for $420.69. If yours is the only offer at that time in the entire world (no happening), they’ll have to buy it if they are being forced to cover their short contracts. 

However, if someone sees your order and then sets theirs $1 lower they’ll they’ll buy those shares. So on and so forth but extrapolate with millions of sellers all who would be happy with gains well below $420.69. 

So that’s why my point about who owns GME shares vs who owned VW shares is important. In VW case the available shares were controlled by two entities. In our case there are way more buyer and sellers who can decide to sell once the market price goes up/down.

No, just if all shorts covered, it would take around 6 days of straight buying to cover roughly based on volume.

🤷‍♂️  I don't know man.

I was willing to bet heavy cash on the price going up from $18 to some unknown price. I'm not willing to bet the same cash today on $36 going up.  When new SI data comes out on the 20th then we re-evaluate.  My fear is that SI is actually at a healthy level of 10-20%.
Doesn't factor how much money has been pumped into the system. Doesn't factor that bonds give you absolutely nothing. Doesn't factor that rates are going to be low forever. 

Does factor that bull run can continue. But if it goes up 30% more and then go down 10% then you are still up. 

I was a die hard bear a few months ago. Got sick of fighting the Fed. Now long but hedge positions accordingly.
You missed the point. Fidelity doesn’t allow limit orders where the limit price is more than 50% away from the current price.

Me too like I have ridiculous conviction in this pick. Most I ever put into calls/leaps and also have shares in my Roth.

Main catalyst of the VQ squeeze was also Porsche announcing they controlled 40% more shares than any thought...on a Sunday.  Which meant less than 1% of shares were actually available.

GME share ownership is well known so for there to be a megasqueeze of everyone trying to get out at once you would some sort of news event.

But nooo GME 🚀 🌙
Probably, depends how wild Cohen would go about making impact. GME certainly has money for agresive buisness twist... Noone knows
i am thinking we see a slight rally into earnings soon, followed by flat earnings
If you make pharma plays (*blessing be to his holiness Martin Shkreli*) you probably already know about $LLY's antibody treatment for COVID-19 called Bamlanivimab ([https://www.fda.gov/media/143602/download](https://www.fda.gov/media/143602/download)), so piss off.

This is for everyone else who has probably only heard of Regeneron's **monoclonal antibody** offering because the Overweight Orange Squatter at 1600 Pennsylvania Ave received a dose.

So why $LLY and why now, since this antibody treatment has been approved since November?

Well, as Einstein famously said, "*The definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over again, but expecting different results.*"

Unless you've just recovered from a coma, you know that in 5 days there will be a new proverbial sheriff in town in Washington, DC.  Along with him will be a new Covid Task Force and I bet you my $GME shares they will absolutely NOT stay the present course of, well, doing whatever the hell it is that's being done now.

Remember, there are already doses of Bamlanivimab (let's just call it "BAM" for short) because it's an existing drug that received FDA Emergency Use Authorization for Covid. $LLY is already making more BAM and, more importantly, $LLY is already testing BAM against the mutated versions of Covid (TL;DR- looking good for the UK variant, not so good for the SA variant). Remember also that $LLY struck a deal with the US Government for $1,250 per dose of BAM.

Now the tricky thing about BAM is that it has to be administered early, when Covid is first detected. It's also an intravenous drug, so administration takes a few hours. This of course has been a logistical nightmare for over-stretched healthcare facilities.

BTW, if you want to see if BAM is already available near you go to [https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/therapeutics-distribution#distribbution-locations](https://protect-public.hhs.gov/pages/therapeutics-distribution#distribbution-locations)

Anyway, my thesis is the Biden team will push for some kind of centralized Covid Crisis Centers (yeah, I freaking love alliteration, bite me) that will do (1) Testing, (2) Therapeutics, and (3) Vaccinations.  Imagine it: get a rapid test for Covid and, if it's appropriate, head over to Area B for $LLY's BAM treatment. If your rapid test is negative, well head over to Area C for Vaccination.

Well, thank you for coming to my TEDTalk.

If you think I'm full of shit, please do consider something like $XPH because I guarantee you in five days the Biden Administration is going to come out swinging for the fence on a changed-up Covid response.  If you think I might be onto something, stop and ponder Covid pharma company names-which company names already come to mind: Pfzier, J&J, and Regeneron? That's why I'm thinking $LLY is my dark horse.

TL;DR: $LLY = Moon

How is this sub any different from things like mad money? In that show, he's literally telling people what to buy too.
Something tells me less than 10% of the call holders are actually exercising.  They will undoubtedly sell them back on the market, unless they roll them out.

Not really a bad thing, but know that it allows more supply on the market, which in turn gives the shorts more room to cover.  Of course, there is the flip side of that.  It means the *puts* that expired had to *buy* shares.  Most importantly, options are still insanely profitable for covered calls, so the long squeeze is still easily in play.  All of this is a net positive.  As long as GME gains in value and options are what they are, along with the inability to feasibly delay the margin calls, and the hype train, that still adds to the squeeze.

So John Chen is pretty amazing. This company has a lot of potential. The long term debt is going down over since he took over and they have moved all of the useless smart phone inventory. The value of the company at it's current price with just cybersecurity is quite undervalued. I believe this is a long buy but will profit quite nicely. To me it's hilarious that the best place to learn about under valued stocks is in a subreddit that calls themselves autists.

They're only really screwed if they sold naked calls i.e. they never owned the underlying shares
Every two weeks. But they can’t cover in that timeframe so that fine.  There’s some other smaller indicators of the short interest too, but it’s not the whole stock, just a few brokerage.
If GME started buying back 5% of company shares, they could cause one hell of a squeeze.

Studies from state universities I take with a grain of salt. 

Especially after going to psu for 5 years, and after graduating and actually getting into my work field (cyber security) I learned EVERYTHING they taught me was incorrect, outdated by 10 years, and not nearly how the industry works or is handled anymore. Had to self teach myself everything from scratch. 90k for absolutely nothing. 

The universities are so far up their asses that they think their opinions are 100% correct and never need to change. It becomes an echo chamber of professors thinking they know it all when there's a reason they became teachers and not the best in their fields. When in reality the shit they are teaching doesnt even exist anymore in the actual work force. 

So yeah, on opinion pieces like this article, fuck them. They are more retarded than us.

Not just from illegal activity. I'm surprised they haven't shit it down due to "hate speech" yet.

I've gotten messages from reddit for "Rule Violation: Warning for Promoting Hate" for posting messages containing phrases like "retard" or "gay bear" or "**REDACTED**'s delight". Doesn't matter that it was all good-natured. Seen entire reddit comment threads get removed because someone was misgendered.

Great information. If you're a Fidelity user and pull up any option chain for a stock, there is a tab on the screen called "trade ideas". Click there and you can filter for high call, high put, high option volumes. These lists will also tell you how high the volume is above normal and can be sorted on that.

BB is more than a phone company - though their segments are lack luster, and they continue to sell their patents to other companies. They also can't afford to pay a dividend because they are barely skating by, and thinking of BB as a growth company is a literal joke. Until there is someone like Cohen that can get on their board and bringing BB back to life this just seems like a pump and dump.

Ok think about it this way, the money you’re throwing down on rent each month is basically a 100% loss in the grand scheme of things (besides it providing you shelter).

 For example I was paying $1,900 a month on rent, my house mortgage + taxes are like $1,600 so I’m already up $300+ a month and it builds equity. So it’s basically a savings/equity builder in the long run. The value of my house has also gone up 50%+ in the few years I’ve owned it. It’s just another investment vehicle . If your rent skyrockets my mortgage costs the same (ex taxes).. If rates drop like crazy I refi and get a lower rate
Exactly, so why doesn't OP just report all the posts he sees? (Real question!)

Be careful, don't be a stupid bull when things change. Buy a few protective puts 1-2 years out. Use those LEAP puts to sell weeklies puts to dumb bears that are too early, stop selling weeklies or ensure you are selling at a price you profit if assigned 2 months or so.

Also, keep pumping GME, don't worry about an overall market correction. VW soared during one of the worst months of the '08 crash.

Congrats on the gains brotha ! May the gains gods bless the rest of us .
You do know insiders can;t sell the same way a retail person does right? They have to file with the SEC to sell to avoid insider trading regulations. Somehow, I don;t think the guy is hurting after neting 17mil
I bought the 6 of the $690 call back in May 2019 for about $1,200 (or 30 of $138 post split). Good job!

Bloomberg published an article about it as well saying the squeeze is not the major force behind the last price spike. There is more squeeze to come. 

“There is a GameStop short squeeze, but no the squeeze is not the major  force behind the price move,” Ihor Dusaniwsky, managing director of  predictive analytics at S3 Partners, said by email.

It's gone to shit ever since we hit ~1M subscribers, then again that's when stonks officially started to only go up, so there's that
so when the market crashes like it's about to next week, you can still make money! Here's how:

- sell all ur calls (all of them)
- put your entire buying power into puts that aren't 60%+ IV already, ideally the weekly expiry (or 0DTE SPY!)
-sell once your portfolio has gone 4-5x in value

Ez Pz!

I am definitely bad at Discord and think 500 messages per second is hard to follow, it moves too fast. Especially on the phone version. The few times I asked a question, it was either drowned between the gifs, the rockets, or answered by “YES TO THE MOON” or similar basic sentences. 
Also, you can pretty much track the post history of any one you interact with here, which can give you assurance that you’re not talking to anyone who has either no clue, or an hidden agenda lol

Thanks for putting this together. I’ve been in since it was $15 and keep adding more whenever I get the chance. The fact that Cathie picked this up in her ARK funds says a lot. 

Also - Fuck AOC
I think there's value in shutting the fuck up, but I dont think the risk is in SEC involvement in the sub. Most of the DD I've seen is charting, and thematic analysis, which gets a bunch of autists all rowdy to go buy a stock. THAT is not manipulation, that is no different than seeking alpha, or Cramer. 

I think instead of ranting about this shit the mods should stick about how to differentiate MNPI from memes which is the actual risk for insider trading. 

Sure, the SEC might get twisted about us acting in concert to manipulate prices, but IMO it doesn't seem were organized enough to do that, its not like we're trying to influence market depth or liquidity with trading schemes, DD posts containing no MNPI are the equivalent of Morgan Stanley saying "new PO on TSLA: 2000." Thats just how actual smart people say $TSLA🚀🚀🚀🌕🌕🌕🌕🤜🤜🌈🌈🌈🐻🐻 in finance speak. 

IMO, the real problem is big money actually paying attention to what people are saying on WSB. THEY can actually react fast enough to DD and shit posts to get ahead of WSB sentiments. And everything we put on here is public info, they can trade ahead of us all day er day.

I said this on here in a post like 3 months ago. Preserving this power is far more important than exploiting it.

If you don't have something important to say, or a high quality meme, then shut the fuck up retards.

To be fair, I've only been on here for about a year and consider myself in part of the "I should shut the fuck up" crowd.

To all of you who make this sub what it is, thank you so much, you are fucking legends and don't let anyone tell you different.

it’s possibly they would have died anyway because they’re old
Everyone on BB right now is just doing flight prep, warming up the engine. After GME finally does squeeze Melvin for everything he’s worth, and the sell does eventually come, the retards here aren’t just gonna pack up their tendies and go home. 

They’re gonna take it all, and go 100% into the next meme stock wsb says; BB. It’s a solid company with good long term potential, even boomers like it.

You need to do your DD on Blackberry to see why it's not a pump and dump, and sorry to say this but BB fundamentals are much better than GME. If GME should be at $80, then BB should be at $200 NOW, $500+ in the future. BB didn't just pop up of nowhere, it was always there, people just didn't want to see it.

I'll leave this here, see for yourself how undervaluated BB is: [https://i.imgur.com/EbenKKh.png](https://i.imgur.com/EbenKKh.png)

You do realize as of closing on Thursday there was a record amount of shorts on GME right? The entire volume for friday was slightly below 46 million. So even if EVERY SINGLE TRADE was a shorter covering, that would just barely be over half, which is extremely unlikely since the prize went down, not up. So if thats what you think a short squeeze looks like... well I wont be enticed to take your advice on just about anything
Fuck Melvin Capital! I bought another 100 shares at the close due to post about 50k employees as well.
Europoor wins again 😎
Melvin?
Pull up that VW chart...*the* infinity squeeze was preceded by a sharp down day (or perhaps two). 

The shorts slept oh so easily last night—the stock’s gains have begun to erase themselves, they must be thinking.
 Fidelity and Schwab are confirmed to have eliminated margin on $GME (NEUTRAL) 

that means users can no longer short sale gme which means margin calls **bullish**

Thoughts on NNDM?
This is exactly what I did. 

Made 100% on GME in two days after reading all the DD for weeks then pulling the trigger and literally the next day went to the moon! 100% gain 

High off euphoria, I did none of the work with BB.

The stock market is a joke if a comment on Reddit can cause significant money to change hands.
Where did you get this info?
No the fucking point is, if someone is that fucking retarded giving us “inside information” on a public forum, for a bunch of retarded keyboard warriors, it probably isn’t fucking valid “insider information”

People who want to make actual money on inside info, will tell people close to them, and keep it to themselves.  They’re not trying to make other people rich. 

Loose lips sinks ships, you fucking retards.
Even if I agree with some parts of your post.. maybe you are also the one who has to change your mindset a bit.

First and foremost: the stockmarket is a casino. With many years, people invented more and more weird betting systems, called them structured products. You can meanwhile "bet" on assets, you normally can not trade like water.. 

Now thanks to digital transformation and a pandemic which forces people to stay home a lot where they 1. Don't spend that much money and 2. Have time to "inform themselves".. this with the offer of easy/free/cheap trading platforms, there is a new movement. I don't say it is only r/wallstreetbets but I guess we are a big part of this movement.

Now it begins that the smart wallstreet professionells are wrong about predictions.. yes if many people buy something, the price goes up. 
That the stockmarket development has nothing to do with economy we all saw in the USA.. economy is plunging, many people loose Jobs, many people die.. close to a civil war.. trump dividing the nation.. 
But the stockmarket (s&p500) is at a record high?

All I want to say: there is a big change going on. Learn to deal with it. Don't be mad if one of your puts gets busted only because WSB members yolo the crap out of it.

Instead of destructively criticizing newbs, educate them and maybe learn something new on the way yourself.

I am happy to be part of this weird community and I hope it changes on the long run how we handle resources and money in this planet one day.

BTW: BB yolo!

So a share bought on margin is technically not yours but has been lent to you. So then, how can that same share then be lent out again to someone else if it's already been lent out to you? How many times can one share be lent out at the same time? I don't know a lot about stock trading but this doesn't seem logical.

PLTR is just like any other hyped stock. Buy some, ride the wave. GME without the short squeeze would be in a similar situation with RC at the helm: just another hyped stock that may have potential.

The nigh guarantee of a short squeeze on GME makes this a whole different animal. 

And why do you think the short is over? Do you honestly believe that 100%+ of the shorts covered without sending the stock to triple digits?

This is what I have said all along.  It is not illegal for people to come together and talk about what stock to buy.  That is exactly what investment groups do.  

Yes, WSB is different because of the size of the group, but it is still a bunch of retards talking about what stock to buy. If this was illegal, then there would be no such things as investment groups, and it might as well be illegal to talk about investments altogether.  

The only time it’s illegal is if we are trading on insider information. And I guarantee you that no one on this sub Reddit has given any MATERIAL insider information  to any of us.  I know we are all retarded autists, but you have to be some kind of stupid to think someone is going to risk jail time by giving out actual insider information to a bunch of random fucking jerk offs they’ve never met on this sub Reddit.
I think GME had something to do with BB's rise as well but less a conspiracy. 

Undervalued, stock price was much higher in the past, turning a corner into a new market sound familiar? BBBY also had a pretty good day GME spiked as well so this idea might have some traction. 

But as GME sold off Friday, for some it was finally getting rid of their bags, for others it was a loss of confidence in the speculation play.

Don't think it was a pump and dump. I've said this before and I'll say it again, stocks and leaps for BB.
agreed

It's the intent to work together to artificially inflate the SP. I don't understand how this would be illegal either though. Idiots should not have shorted more than the float. They stepped in a big ol pile of shit.
Then the Africans should cut the hands off of those individuals who are in their country stealing things.

Just read the replies

Buying more on tuesday if thy hasn't already squozen.
I don't have any money in GME, but damn I hope you guys win. 

It would be pretty funny to see the bottom line of an investment bank destroyed because they attempted to steamroll the little guy with their deep pockets, rather than making the smart call and cashing out when the position moved against them.  

It would be a good cautionary tale for the big boys that they aren't invincible and still need to follow good investing practices and risk management.
This would be a hard case to prove. Unless the SEC can pin this on ONE person with insider information, the markets are literally doing what markets do. Bubbles are nothing new, speculation is nothing new. Retail investors raiding the hen house is nothing new; big boys walking away fine, while retail gets left with nada: Classic.

They need retail to keep the pyramid of stocks going up. The stock market at it's core is a legal pyramid scheme. If those idiot wendy's employees aren't buying stock at 2x leverage with their 300 dollar paycheck, who will? 

More of this has to do that a lot on wallstreet are mad that retail has kinda raised up in a once in a generation move to make money. This happened in the 1920, 1950s, 1980, 1990, 2000 and now. It always resets. For OP to talk like he has some knowledge otherwise shows that he is being left out in the short term, or doesn't study history.
Penny stock alert!!  Ban!!
God, I wish I could read!
The other thing I didn’t mention is that short % is over 100%.  Don’t think VW was that bad
This needs to be top response. We are not insider trading without an insider. We are collectively being autistic. There is a large difference.

Just wait for the next down turn in the market.  It  will unfortunately wipe out a lot of the people here.  Everybody trading thinks they’re invincible right now.  Dangerous if you ask me.

Add shares to cushion
If you've been lucky enough to cash in big on GME, then just slide on over to thetagang after you cash in your winnings.  Start making some easier plays on selling puts on stocks you like and covered calls on stocks you own.  No need to go all FOMO every time a new rocketship start fueling around here.
Can someone link me a video to where I can learn about this? I have no clue wtf is happening. What are the negative implications of this type of strategy?
Yep got 100 at 10.30 - we all need to do our part to fly to the moon

Looking at yesterday trading volumes, it is not much buy volumes throughout the day. Therefore, Melvin Capital has not closed their 74 million 24 short call GME yet I think but GME stock price keep tanking as Melvin Capital has not bought back the shares yet.
If Bear Stearns was named Bull Stearns it’d probably be around today.
I also have 750 shares, bought around the bottom of that around 35.38! Brother in arms!

Pretty sure they don’t have M1 Abrams deployed to DC. Those are called MRAPs mine resistant ambush protected vehicles.
That's because they weren't "storming" the capitol.

You can't "storm" something if they let you and then wave you on to walk in.

There's enough videos out there of people walking single-file inside the capitol, police opening "barricades" and a police officer running up to a crowd, waving people to run to the capitol.

They let those people in intentionally.
It's not illegal for senators to take confidential briefings and play the market based of their privileged information though. I call fucking bullshit.

Nothing wrong with meme stocks. But have you heard about GME, here's 1000 posts about the exact same stock and price, it was easily over looked. No way to make it easier like compressing into something, like a thread that even pennystocks have
Shut up Oscar.

And I'm not saying that it isn't, for the record. It would be way easier to push up another decent stock than a needlessly shitty one. Especially if your firm is already invested in BB.
Yes but daytraders in prison only trade cigarettes and shanks.

Totally agree. I'm here to read, understand, learn and relearn and re-read and re-understand and keep on going. I do not get these meme posts however!
Any idea how call options will play out? Will the option sellers just wait for it to dip back down or actually pay the astronomical price?

What does this mean
I avoided BB because it reeks of pump and dump. Lots of posts from ~30-40 days ago, then nothing until this past week or so. 

I like plays with persistent, rampant autism.
Correct me if I'm wrong, cuz I'm retarded and all. But can't we sell the shares to the short sellers at any price since the HAVE to buy all the shares to cover and then some?
You're not too crazy. If you told me... in the 90s or early 2000s this story... I'd think you're crazy. Once I started working in cybersecurity, my mind changed.

That said, I'm invested in BB. I've had my eyes on them for over a year and I think the transition they've made is the right long term move. I think it's a decent long term play. However, GME, infinity or bust. The money I have there is not leaving until I make 1000000%. Why? Cause fuck em.

Scuse my friend he meant "autists"
Did you hear that GME went up this week? If you missed it I can show you a chart... In a fucking thread
I edited my comment to include 2017. 2017 there was potential insider trading, sub went private for a while. 2019 was iron condor box spreads, then we had the infinite money glitch on RH.

It’s all innocuous stuff for the regular user but it’s enough for an entity like the SEC to cause havoc conducting an investigation.
You should take that over to an addiction sub, this is WSB.  We're not your therapists or your support system for battling your vices.  We are literally the opposite.  So for the sake of your success, don't look for attention here about that kind of stuff.

Someone further up in the thread was complaining about gamestops director selling stock earlier this week, saying that was insider trading.

You must have read some other post if you think GME calls are still a good play lol.
Are you trading options? They usually tell us newbs to stay clear of options for a bit. Good luck, brotha!
What’s he gonna do tho?  Somehow appeal to MSFT and SNE that a competing digital store is good for their business?  And without game resell, GME excludes like half of their revenue...

Shut up nerd.
I think it would be far fetched to think these people are hired to pump BB! But i feel as though massive FOMO was had from non GME holders. Wanted to immediately get on a winning trade so had to find something cheap to pump up as the next thing. Unfortunately that is a terrible plan for several reasons but that does not stop people as you have seen 👍
That's why PLTR has been above 30 for the past 2 months and need 100 posts daily begging for Cathie to buy more? Even the pennystocks have threads. $10 says GME doesn't break 50 next week because the short is over.

Is there no time limit as to when they have to pay those shorted stocks back?
To my limited understanding, they’re getting fucked by interest everyday, but could they in theory, not pay back the stocks for a long time until interest dies down and the price plummets?
What stock is BB lol
If you don't wanna fuck him I will. $20 is $20 or in this case much much more.
Do the limit stops. I'm only at 175 shares but I'm setting up 25 lots starting at 90 and up.

experience with buying and holing....all my
biggest regrets is selling to early. whether it’s a week, months, or years.

change your mindset and ask yourself if there’s a reason you haven’t made it to the big leagues yet. it’s not cuz ur job it’s cuz ur mindset is that of a poor.

Is volume good or bad for the squeeze, sorry if this is a stupid question
Thats because a stock can go to zero. Imagine buying Company X on margin for 20k. If you use original cost basis then you 20k will still be counted where as the actual cost of the stock is now zero. Same thing happens when stock goes from 10k to 100k. If the margin requirement was 30 percent that means now you have 70k available instead of just 7k.

Respect for looking out my man. Its part loan/grant after my tuition was paid for but yeah I did opt in to take the subsidized loan so at least it wont accumulate interest till after I graduate.

Gme gang is definitely the most vocal and annoying gangs of the past year
its not just that they are not able to maintain it. someone posted that an SEC rule is active that forbids shorting GME cos it decreased 10% on Friday (probably cos it got shorted even further from shorter to be able to close their precious shorts cheaper and at the same time scaring investors away cos it looks like a bubble popping). that rule is then valid for a whole day. otherwise an institution could short a stpck instantly with a lot of money. that would be huge manipulation.
so if i got it correctly there wont be any shorting on GME allowed on tuesday. so stock price will just fall from paperhands selling or shares becoming avaliable from options.

can someone correct me if im wrong ?
Re - do the poll

> We can remain retarded longer than you can stay solvent
I've just browsed this sub for 2 or 3 years now, and while everyone has always said and done really stupid shit on a regular basis (why else would I be here), it's always been more of, "hey I'm a fucking retard look what I did" rather than, "hey retards let's go do this!". And it needs to stay that way otherwise this sub is toast.

Did I word that properly, I have no clue.

I couldn’t retire early, but there’s a shit ton I could do 😂
So you’d rather spend 200K+ to get 10% shitty increase in housing than spend it on here for actual tendies?
As someone who has a diverse portfolio across multiple sectors- Friday was a bad day for a lot of stocks.  I lost about 3% across a diversified portfolio.  No idea what BB will rise to, but I am glad I bought a cheap put on it to cover myself if it does drop and if it stays low.

Great DD, it aggregates all the public info on PLTR quite well. 

Although, I think an increase in R&D cost is a good thing for companies that are supposedly growing. Especially for a company who is currently trading at around ~40x P/E. 

Also, can you elaborate on why you think PT will be 50+ by April and 100+ next year? They would need to significantly increase their earnings or they'd be around SNOW levels of overvaluation (100+x P/E).

Definitely a different thing. Let's break down the probable timeline before and after the peak.

First, a possible violent rise, but not like VW's due to the difference in the parties involved and distributed concentration of shares in each. Is it a single day event? I do not think so. Take into account shorts needing to cover, new retail investors jumping in thanks to the news and social media as well as potentially other larger players. Such will indeed force the price up likely over a few days. 

The aftermath will involve a dip of course with a faster rate of decay in comparison to the peak. However will it ever go below $30? Not likely and truly think it will never be below $20s again. Many will try to time the top, jump off the rocket and buy the dip and hold in anticipation for the results of the new executive team likely to take over before summer. 

I'm using Fidelity for shares and TD for calls. I'm likely going to need to stage my sales as it rises the day of the event due to Fidelity limit order pricing range. I was thinking a ratio (high risk) for my sales as:
%15 (of shares) - limit order
%15 limit order
%20 limit order
%20 limit order
%30 trailing stop lost %5 or %10 to jump the rocket after the peak. 

Disclosure, I am not professional in this area. Just someone that learns fast, has an engineering background and can connect the dots as new information appears. Happy to be corrected and truly appreciate if you read this far. Good luck 🚀 🚀 🚀

Wait so what’s the catalyst for BB? their ceo is trying to turn profit but it’s a 5 year contract
Haven't you seen the DD's that GME's short ratio has only increased yesterday instead of decreased (that's what drove the price down)? It still has a short ratio of comfortably over 100%, so the short squeeze has only happened for a fraction and the price alreadyh doubled. Just imagine what'll happen when the other shorts have to recover.

I agree. In additiion to that, my two cents (that's all I have left anyways) is that we have a weekly/bi-weekly "Will it print?" sticky for the people wanting to ask questions about their plays. This way we won't get "spammed" by all the should I hold should I not hold posts too.
Nice
Someone posts this every time a new meme stock emerges. NIO, PLTR, TSLA, and GME have all suffered the same fate.

I'm new to investing. I get that he is a bit of meme and I always take what he says with a grain of salt but he is both "entertaining and educational" for me. I think his attitude to embrace new investors and even FOMO is pretty awesome considering his roots and experience. I'm a Merriman and I'm ok with that lol.
Quit it with the awards you degens, instead spend your money on GME at open Tuesday while your wifes boyfriend is giving her the pipe. THEN just MAYBE THEN after it moons she'll let you watch.
No but, improved credit rating, new issues, more satisfied shareholders etc. Lots of benefits to having a healthy share price
Not sure if I feel bad for the blind kid or us
5000 shares. Hold.
I‘m balls deep in GME if ur galkin bout that
It won’t. It’s like one of those fights in middle school where we all wasted time trying to see nothing

The short-squeeze hasn't even begun yet, the current rocketing is just due to people getting in ready for it.

The more people buy and hold GME shares (SHARES, not calls/CFDs), the more aggressive the squeeze.
Also the way https://i.imgur.com/Uxd3vCT.jpg
That's not a hard question. Fat cats are smart enough to back their manipulation with something that at least resembles research and not outright "buy this meme stock to force a short squeeze".
Tldr 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
But that standoff is legendary!  It's the gift of youth.  We can have crazy big balls because even if we die, we'll never die.
Damn, you mean this whole time I've been stepping outside to check my portfolio for no reason?
same here I bought 800 shares @11.15 and dont know should I sell or hold.
The problem is... BB isn't a phone company anymore and people keep calling it a phone company.  They don't make phones anymore.
That's not insider trading either though.
But, Im not in school anymore.
If big firms are actively scanning the internet for stock tickers and rockets to gauge interest and someone figures out that if you spam a bunch of tickets and rockets you can fuck with the algos it’s hard to tell who is smart or dumb. It’s better to be lucky, and grateful.

Europoors
but thats exactly what they want. If you go BK your money goes to them.
So what happens if GME issues more shares?

I have no clue but I’m guessing 2 outcomes. We buy the shares and the shorts still get squeezed, just less hard. Or the short squeeze never happens.

It's not a refund. It's a loan. I'm not telling you not to do it. If I could have been wiser during the housing crisis I'd have used student loans to buy stock.

But if you're in the US, and using loans to help pay for school, that's debt. Just keep that in mind. It's a stipend, the amount of money left over not needed for school. You're choosing to take more. It's like buying a car for 10, but having a loan for 12 and pocketing the extra 2. Do you, just know what you're doing.

If you're going to a for profit online school. Nevermind. I don't need anymore flashbacks.

Bad post: "Hey guys lets commit a crime, we all need to buy BB shares tomorrow at open!"
Got some new data from today!?
GME isn't the same as the Volkswagen squeeze
The market cap filter is great. There really is no worries about anything sec related. Seeking alpha, market watch, and every other youtube finance charlatan all shill stock picks.

The only fear is that wsb turns into the forums like raging bull of the dotcom boom where stocks were pumped and dumped. It was mostly penny stocks with rampant manipulation. I think people are more aware of such scheming but fomo is real.

Options weren't a thing back then though either. The mentality is different.
Mondays a holiday? FUCK
I think people are hyping it too much.  Nothing will happen.  There will be protests in people's states, especially hard red states but I don't think that anything "bad" is going to happen.

How much have you lost so far, bud?

I, too, am trying to learn.. and gamble with just a small part of my investment money. Was ok until I forgot to put a limit order on FCEL.. bitch opened $20.5 and I lost like $60 over Thursday/Friday.

Another $40 or so on some other stuff yesterday, *but* I saw that coming w/ papa bearden's lockdown talk. Some of what I bought will lose until travelling recovers lol. 

Damn you, FCEL..
How much money did you lose?
Considering the average retail trader lasts less than 1 year in the market, I’d say I think we are safe.

Are you saying he's manipulating us? The Hedges are letting him shout out to WSB to pump GME because they plan to make bank on the bag holders, for example?
Thinking about getting 1/2 after the divorce??
You can say goodbye.
You’re arguing semantics at this point. The difference being that and a pump and dump (which includes lies or distorted information) and people on here saying, “$gme is going to the moon”, is negligible. It’s still a scheme and it’s still considered illegal by the SEC.

“Although some short squeezes may occur naturally in the market, a scheme to manipulate the price or availability of stock in order to cause a short squeeze is illegal.” -SEC

Maybe pay attention to the point of my comment rather than trying to one-up me over terminology. Can you not understand the point, or you just a smart ass?

>We would need a catalyst that would make shorters panic as they did in 2008.

Could it be argued that the panic happened because it was a surprise? Not much of a surprise with GME because of all this chatter, no?
 
I would think that would reduce the chance of the squeeze happening as much because people see it coming... unless the math behind it happening is just that solid.

Agreed. 

If for a second anyone thinks major players aren't planning on parsing these posts for trends and assigning weights to different users to filter the noise, let me tell you, you're dead wrong. 

They'll toss $10M a year into paying a team of data scientist to find trends based on user sentiment and beat 99% of us to gains. My guess it's already happening. 

Also, note about percieved market manipulation. If for a second you think Melvin won't turn around and try to recoup his money somehow after we've basically broadcast a group effort, you're living under a rock. These guys are ruthless and don't give one shit about you, your wife or her bf, or how the world perceives them.

It's more like 30%. After $412k in capital gains, federal tax rate goes from 15% to 23%. And you also have include state income tax (assuming he doesn't live in a no-income tax state).

Squabbling about whether 11 or 10 was a good time to buy, is like arguing about pennies when there's dollars on the table.
Man I'm buying more shares on Tuesday
I'm gonna hold my stocks in both for over a year, while throwing down calls when I feel like the price is about to jump.  I bout like 200 APHA shares at $5.50 back in November, then put down $10.5 1/28 calls back at $9.10 that went great recently
This is the reason I try not to buy stocks of companies that are already up a lot and then people start posting here. Never know who's who and who's lying about shit. Sometimes I'd still put a small position though but sell pretty quick for quick gains

There is no way in hell this is illegal. I agree with everything else posted though.

I think they crack down on that before they come running to close down a reddit subforum full of shitposters who think they can outsmart the big money.
Just buy shares and sit on them long term. This is a solid company.

They received FDA approval to market their product dec 2019... Not sure what you're still waiting on. Unless you mean the MRTP? Which gives them the ability to label and advertise appropriately. I wouldn't expect you to know the difference though. 

Genetic engineering to control levels of thc for hundreds of years? Any sources there? XXII can not only control thc growth but they can isolate and control levels of specific cannabinoids. Thc, cbd, cbg, and dozens of others. 

Also big tobacco has tried to genetically engineer tobacco with no nicotine. They have been unable to. PMI has a patent from the 90s that indicates they were working on this, but they were unable to achieve reduction levels like XXII has. No other company can produce tobacco with virtually no nicotine.

A stricter separation between DD, Memes, Gain/Loss. Mabye the implementation from different research tools for DD. And we could implement the idea from two days ago with an interactive table or something like that to keep track of current shares and volumes.

Unless something can trigger a chain reaction in margin calls on short positions. At this point I don’t know if it’s that unlikely anymore. Then again my brain’s pretty smooth

Does NNDM have a direct tie to a space company or something? I understand 3D printing is obviously the way to do thing on the ISS, but do we have any hard evidence anyone in the sector is actively working with them?

And while we’re at it, can we shut the fuck up about GME already. Go ahead, downvote me to hell. But before you do, understand that you need $70M to move the stock price $1. As much as you want to believe WSB is responsible for this run up, it’s not.

They were not trying to corner the market with yolo calls. They wanted to secure majority of voting rights, which due to a boomer German law was set at >75% for VW. Porsche bought a metric shit ton of calls so they would not have to disclose an increase in positions. (Which they only did after voluntarily exercising those calls)
Don’t downplay how epic Porsche was, shit makes me jizzy in my pants to this day
Literally same thing happened to me, I even went over by 50c to counter the rapid fluctuation.
Sorry. I meant 4 to 6 days minimum, but for some reason I typed m like months lol

I thought the same thing.
Like 6 months out I might get a 100 return on 20 bucks, okay, that's 5x

Or I can get 100 return on 80 bucks weekly.

If I risk 80 total in 6 months, that's a 400 return for 320 profit

Or risk 80 each week for 6 months, if I won them all that is 2400 return or 480 profit
Yeah exactly, one other thing that I like about this sub is that we don't take ourselves seriously and talk about the market in an entertaining way. Coming here for advice isn't the best but it is so good for making sense of the "trader culture" if this make sense. Still remember when I started lurking here 3 years ago, I had already been investing for 4 years and even at that time felt like you guys were talking a different language than me for a few weeks haha.

Caution sir, every time I have felt the hype the next day was massive red.  We aren't near as coordinated as a 1B hedgefund.

Last week was a gamma squeeze. Got another squeeze coming baby. These shorts are about to get margin called
You can, but this is tied - at least in Germany - to some paperwork you have to get done before they activate your account to option trading.

You have to agree in writing that you have understood the risk that comes with it etc...so nothing that is currently super quick and easy done via an app.
The bear traps that will be set for retards are going to be epic. Billionaires are not going to let you fuck up their money for long. Watch for the face-melting loss porn soon to come. I think I already got caught in one with BB

I've only been here a month, this is the first serious post I've seen. Well said advised that needs to be adhered to
I wouldn't worry too much about this scenario.  I held over 10k shares of GME in my Fidelity margin account at a basis of 14 per share.  I also had 200 shares of TSLA, and some long term option plays here and there.  At first, my GME was margined at 50%, but as the price went up and got into the 20's, the Fidelity algos triggered margin calls as they reduced the margin % allowed on GME until it was basically no margin allowed.  It was above 90% when I finally sold some so I didn't have to liquidate my entire portfolio to stay at my current share level of GME.  I called and spoke to a couple reps about why I was getting a new margin call every morning when I haven't changed my positions and my holdings were all going up.  They said that since GME went up more than my other holdings, that my concentration went up on GME, so my margin allowance on GME went down.  They did this every morning for an entire week, basically forcing me to sell any GME I owned on margin, as the stock was shooting up.  Felt like fuckery to me, as my cost basis hadn't changed and the stock was up nearly 100% for me.  

So long story short, if these people are buying GME on margin, unless they are heavily diversified, they are either going to not be allowed to move forward on the margin trade, or they are going to be bled over the next few days as the margin algos rip their assholes apart.  Nobody is going to be holding many thousands of shares of GME and then get a full blown 100% margin call on all shares one morning.

It’s gotten exponentially worse in the last few weeks given the newfound exposure that WSB is getting. Cramer has been talking about ‘reddit traders’ more and more, and the GameStop action got WSB into the Wall Street Journal, along with several other big news outlets. Lots of new blood in here coming in thinking they’ve somehow just stumbled into a price-fixing subreddit.

If there isn’t a course correction soon, or some other moderation tactics, I don’t think it’s impossible that the SEC or some other government body makes a phone call to Reddit admins to shut the party down.

It’s in my comment history from 4 months ago when I established my original position of 1300 shares at $9 so do you know what they are worth at $41?, that’s a 40k gain.. on shares I bought 4 months ago, assuming I never added a single share.. or 21c or jacked to the tits CFD’s.. but I did and that’s why I no longer have to work a job.

Stand still agreement.
How does it work? It just does
You have 10 shares...... imagine being that poor
Some great advice I got was to decide what gains you would be happy with and won’t regret and that as your exit point.  Then don’t look back. Since you are in EU set a Good Till Cancelled sell order so it automatically triggers if that price is reached. 
Another good tip is to potentially sell only part of your shares at a price that makes you happy and let the rest ride some more.
Gottem
Fuuuck, this makes my gains make feel like I've earned the "WeakFuckingValue".  🤡
I wonder if there's a bunch of people (retail or investment firms) that didn't do much DD (especially around the short interest issue) and still says "ok GME is the next blockbuster I'm just gonna short it it can't go tits up"

So then we still have \~2 days at least. Maybe more since this is/was predicted, and margin reqs keep going up.
Pltr’s biggest issue is not being profitable yet.

I dont think anyone posted a DD with math on this sub before. 

Interesting arbitrage situation though.
One of the things I always disliked about Trex was the wood grain pattern, they only made (maybe not anymore?) one pattern which makes your deck look less appealing. Azek makes multiple grain patterns which does a much better job of making it look more like real wood. Personal preference but I’m in on shares since I saw first hand the lumber shortage when I went to put my new deck on.

Edit: typos

Hard to say, but there might be quite a bit of rightward movement 🤔
I mean friday we're above the previous 52 week high amd people are crying that its a crash. Makes me very bullish toward the next few weeks, and of course the long term as well. Had no idea this was all happening under our noses.

Yea, I think the key to this sub's survival is effective moderation. You can't depend on the smooth brained masses to pay attention, and adhere to standards if the said standards are not made clear and consistently enforced.
After the LL thing in Dec or Jan everyone was freaking out.
It cost me money, but I did learn from it.
Then in March the government, Bill Ackmans tears, manucjin, literally everyone manipulated the fuck out of the market and this subject got quite.
In the end you can’t keep people from doing dumb shit. But it does seem like sometimes the cards are so fucking stacked against retail.

Thank you guys for sharing your opinions, I really love it to see other people’s comments on the market. $BB up to the MOOOONNNN 🌕🌕🌕🌕🚀🚀🚀🚀
No he’s right. Fuckers convinced me to go cash gang and I missed out on one of the greenest days of the year.

Still mad
I am not sure they are exactly "delaying the squeeze", as the squeeze only happens if the shorts are *forced* to cover and I am not sure that is on the cards. 

Big lenders could theoretically force the shorts to cover, but they have no interest in doing so, as they would lose out on income from the shorts. 

The brokers should force the shorts to cover if they are no longer able to meet margin requirements, but I doubt that will be the case for the big players.

If the shorts decide to unwind voluntarily, they will try to do so in a way that causes them minimum pain. On balance, they might be better off doing so gradually without ever selling at a price that has been significantly inflated by a squeeze. They are not going to put themselves in a position where they are covering at insane prices if that would hurt them more than covering gradually and paying borrow fees while they do so. They will try to find the sweet spot, but I have no idea what that would be.
I know, just talking shit to the retards to get em all riled up.
Ig just launched shop. Facebook market place is the only place you can go for criegslist style shopping (better than it). I literally deleted my fb and now WAS FORCED TO make one for marketplace alone.
That’s fine. I had ample opportunity to re buy in the 34 and 35 range and didn’t take it. It’s not like I have missed anything I have actively made a decision that I am happy with my returns and if it goes to 420.69 I’m sure my 30% position is larger than 95% of wallstreet bets 300 shares.

Yeah, I’ve seen those numbers. Not questioning if a squeeze will happen. It’s about comparing it to the largest one in history that I think is setting up unrealistic expectations. Also, those long term institutional investors care about ROI and if this stock hits a point where they are happy with that ROI they can and will unwind their huge positions.

I read the vanity fair article that claims PLTR uses a lot of data anayalst who does the gritty nitty work of extracting the data for it to make sense and its not a lot of automation involved. Can we see if that is true by looking at an expense line? Basically what they are claiming is that as the data sets get bigger and more complex, PLTR is actually losing more money because they require more and more manpower and salary.
For what reason? Inauguration?
They will both print lol
It doesnt matter where we go. Cramer will find us. Then Autists and Retards will stand united again. Hungrier than ever. 

Believe it or not, its better for the "Traditional World" to keep us contained to one centralized location. Makes it easier to monitor us. And since the congregation has begun here, real money makers wont see a need to change it.

The one thing that is more likely to happen is a push towards more political correctness as this place becomes more and more mainstream. That part will probably be enforced by Reddit itself.
Great! So you 12 year olds can go find a different website to conspire on.

Is WSB persia in this scenario?
How do you buy calls with only 1500? Especially on tsla?
It wouldn't  be too bad to get back down to the core though.
Those are market trend not how badass the trader feel when doing the trade. Shorting is bearish.
Well, it is all speculative, at the end of the day.

I said the DD was good; not the performance of the stock.
Yeah true. I sold a bunch of my random calls last week after getting frustrated they weren't going anywhere. will probably overall go sideways and down for a bit.
You do realize every other comment here yesterday was about GME and the stock went down 11% wsb is not as powerful as some of you tards think. It went up 60% in one day it's going to continue to dip for a while.

let me clarify - if you invested in TAN or ICLN from their introduction, you would still be down.  ICLN is currently ~30 and it introduced at ~50.  It has been over 10 years and its never reached its initial value.  The same is true of TAN.

It’s totally different, with different circumstances, how this plays out is yet to be determined. I’m in it not only for the squeeze but also for the turn around growth also, the value is there.  So if the squeeze doesn’t materialize I honestly believe the stock can reach $60 in valuation alone.

So I’m a total noob but I just placed an order( RH) for 39 shares at 9.55 current price. Would my purchase go through at that price or would I be purchasing those shares at a higher price on Tuesday?
40 hours a week for that? Hard pass.
That ship has sailed
Dont cancel the card especially if its an old account... just cut the card up and remove it from amazon etc
HEAR HEAR
Yee of little faith
Why would you want anyone in here to lose
>this sub bearish

what are you on, son
You all going to end sitting next to shkreli
Can everyone just chill on the gme shit?
I like the idea of flairs for at least a year or some shit of being subbed, and the option to filter posts by that flair.
WUT?!?!

$BB 1500 shares in my retirement account at 7.91 and 4500 at 10.99 in my personal...i agree with the $16 price target by mid year and $30 by end of year.... let's go!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I've been following GME  for a while. It always spikes up and dips back down, so the first good green day after the dip I bought weeklies. I didn't think I'd time the squeeze, just that it'd spike back up and I'd probably at least double my money.
Oh you piece of shit.  At least put them in the right order. Model S 3 X Y
hmmm 

the samples I analyzed did point to what you describe. 

I'll have to take my research further.
i only sell when it’s down at least 35%, right before the bounce back up
WE ARE THE PORSCHE MOTHER FUCKER

JUST YOU WAIT
It’s not a huge risk if you believe that it’s undervalued and you believe in their long term goal. While there will be squeeze which is where I will make my exit there could be future organic growth after the squeeze
I have 16 of those same calls haha, I'm a little curious myself

First rule of $GME club, you don't sell at $GME club.

It has only traded since June 2020
His name is u/deepfuckingvalue
This sub is nearing the end. They’re going to shut it down soon enough
Short squeeze hasn’t happened yet. When will the run up start probably this week, what price will it drop too before the run up, idk.
Tuesday! Think of the red as a clearance sale!
Same. For way too long.
Market closed Monday
That would now cost around 500,000 for 50 TSLA leaps. It’s hard enough to watch 5,000 dip to 500 in a few days let alone risk 500,000. 96.95 right now for a Jan 22 1700 leap. Ridiculous.
Lmao just wait for roblox ipo
With what I already made in Gme, that probably bought 1000 post karma reddit all cucks like you here I could pay to fuck your mother. Shut up retard.
And short volume % of float use went up at least 3x from that concurrent run of Thu-Fri on a 3-Day weekend. Large outflow went 4-5x normal. They’re going to want those shares back. Juice is running.
I went door to door with my resume until I found a job then stayed there for 40 years and retired with a pension.
So, your saying. You like comments on your Tendies? Oh, I do too!
Half went here half went to MT calls. I also sold on the way up a couple times.
Fucking aye
The five largest investors in GME own almost 70% and four of them are decades-old slow-moving giants that trust the market. The other is the younger RC Ventures, which wouldn’t sell anyway. If anyone dumps, it’ll be novice paperhands who get scared and didn’t do their DD. Thankfully the proportion is small. Not sure if gme will reach €999 but if the SS starts, it’ll be spectacular.
It’s not. OP is a shill.
Got a 2/19 14c yesterday. I don't even know what that means but its less money for me to blow on coke (or more if this pays out)
[deleted]
[removed]
[removed]
Come on man do some research. 

Look up how much RC owns

Look up how much long term institutional holders own (ie not paper handed bitches) 

Then subtract the sum of the above from the public float

That’s not a lot of shares owned. 

TLDR yes a short squeeze will happen
Congrats man, a little younger and 125k, hope to be at 250k in a few years.
Sub has done doubled in size in like a year and is catching news on major media now. 

If this is considered normal. Where else are these groups? Id fuckin love to have a fall back or alternative input
[removed]
That’s awesome!  Congrats on your gains!! Yeah I’d def be much or comfortable holding past the peak if I had brought in at a lower price.
Honestly, anybody saying this shit doesn’t happen clearly doesn’t sort by new. Great post OP 👏👏

I sold my BB stocks yesterday for 11 and I am happy. I believe it was peak of hype and it will go down again as always.
FUUUUUUUCK NO.  He is not one of us.  He works for them.  He drives the market for THEM.  Hitler acknowledged the strength of the United States of America.   That didn't mean we rushed out to welcome him to our team.
Never let go. Buy more.

If you doubled down now your avg would be in the $10.30ish range. Js
I’ve bought both, I’m looking for a new car and I can’t wait to win big
At LEAST.
Sir this is a Wendy's. What soft drink would you like?
I know a great play that makes you minimum $500 a week. A job mother fuckers! I was thinking about it the this morning. It's a really great play to add to your trading.

Damn bro you need to get laid.
Nice try SEC
sounds like a solid play... don't tempt me someone fkin stop me from pulling the trigger
It’s like they forget Soros is cashing out...
I've felt like these GME posts are to bump the value up when noobies think they can make a quick buck, to get them better returns on their options.

Does GME really have potential?
Nawh
It’s a wazy it’s a woozy
I’m invested in green stocks. So probably yea they will fall til I get out.
Lots of people will long $ROPE
Yep, i put half the stimmy into MT calls. The other half went here. I sold half when it doubled, a few more when it was worth more than my Robin Hood account and then rolled some of that into calls next week.
But that's exactly what people are trying to do here. Everyone's morales can be bought at this point. Politicians and the like. Us normal people will sit on the internet and talk about all the injustices of it all, bitch about low wages and no healthcare, but here at WSB that all can change. We can be in the "in" crowd, make all the money, and continue the cycle of looking down upon "dumb and poor" people. We dont want "Justice" for all the wrong doings and Insider trading we all know has been happening for 40+ years, we just want to be on right side of capitolism. GME is the example, we a know it's shit, but fuck it there's alot of money involved so support them to the moon!
Ryan Cohen kills u/deepfuckingvalue in the the end. We can’t let that happen

That didn't actually happen did it?
Doesn’t sound bad.  I’m just too old to string together words in a rap, can someone tell me if this is bullish or bearish???
Not exactly. Porsche secretly amassed 70%+ of shares through options and announced on Sunday. Unless someone announces they've exercised a metric fuckton of calls I don't see this squeezing to VW levels. That said, 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
To the unemployed that invest and profit from gamestop it is there job as well 1.9 Mil possible employed here.
That wasn't a correction, it wasn't even 1%.

😂😂😂 True
Bless that P-L-T-R
It's not a huge risk if you believe in ryan cohen transforming the company. If you do, the squeeze is just a cherry on top, an extra, at least for me. But i'm in this bitch since 2020 march.
Do some schoolwork?
People’s posts are getting deleted even memes no clue why though
Wow  fantastic work!
Saloons
Yes, this is spot on. The exit point is going to come fast and hard and it will be easy to miss. I saw another post talk about selling slowly. I think that makes sense as it gives you a better chance to hit the peak or catch it on the way down.
[deleted]
Why would it be deleted?
20-30% downside from here
If you don’t mind sharing - what were some of your plays yesterday to outperform the market?
Mlk would want you to be able to trade
Was wondering the same. Got my so much cash tied up in these calls when I could be playing it somewhere else

Show me the person who got laid because of Reddit and I'll show you a liar.
I’m here before your post gets deleted but yes that’s going to be us once we conquer the fucking moon, Mars and universe
Holy shit you're retarded. Going short is absolutely Bearish. Idk wtf you are talking about because Bearish and bullish refer to whether or not you believe the security will decrease in value or increase in value, respectively
No way we pump into the inauguration
Ok boomer.
Hahaha god I love this sub
This is a great question! It probably isn't different at all!

But not the point. We can't control what they do.

OP is trying to keep OUR house clean so that WE don't get OUR retarded family broken up because some idiots start posting flagrantly illegal shit.
so just more moderation is what I am understanding? No need to build a website for that...
Youre in wallstreetbets for legitimate advice? lol
QVC it is!
The autists here weren’t alive in 2008 you fucking retard.
High-risk high reward looks like probably not. In BB for 102 at 10.43
Office at the top baby
Same same, but different.
Not if the company is doing well. Think like an executive at PLTR (rank and file employees don’t have shit for shares and they could ALL sell and it wouldn’t move the needle).

You’ve put years of blood, sweat, and tears into this company and you’re finally seeing light at the end of the tunnel. You’re signing contracts left and right. Cathie is adding you to her portfolio like it’s going out of style. Citi wants you to crash and burn so they can steal your trophy wife. You’re an executive at a public tech company, so you’ve already got money and a giant salary.  You don’t need the money. 

Why sell @25-30 when you can sell @100-300 if you have the guts to have even 2-ply hands and resist the urge to sell at your first chance?
That's a clear violation of the NAP. You should sue.
I didn’t start till 26, you got this.
Love it
I feel stupid. I read about tesla when I was a kid over 10 years ago. I read of his philosophy that it had to be fast or america would care and knew from the moment I read that line that this company was going somewhere...

Fast forward to now and I'm a contractor broken by their trade. Good job OP. I mean that
BUY $BB
Harder to bait people who jump on hooks laid by people looking for bag holders on here
Hopefully it just monthly options expirations (1/15/21) manipulations by MMs. If you look at year chart it holding the 50DMA on 1yr chart so hopefully we get decent bounce early next week if we don't get any crazy news/events over this 3 days weekend...
It would be something to see.  I'm not crazy enough to put that much into it, because there's huge risk.  Also they don't seem to realize that a short squeeze also means a huge drop back to normal right afterwards.  It's not going to maintain those high prices, all those shares that are bought to cover will be dumped just as quickly.
[deleted]
Nah, but you did the ones hyping it up a solid by covering their otherwise worthless calls.
>So with this in mind, does wsb really think this is comparable to the MOASS?

Sounds like SOMEONE had GME puts that expired worthless. Lolololol
This fckr gave me hope I could pull this off with NIO, heart broken realizing your right and this is shopped 🥺😔
The next week should be interesting. I’ve seen price predictions on here that say $600 is realistic. I’m skeptical but an obviously rooting for it.  I just hope people who went yolo and dumped all their money or brought on margin don’t end up regretting this for years.
Accusations of market manipulation would be thrown out so fast. So many market news sites have ads saying they'll tell you where to put your money to make money. The second they have enough people doing that, they're manipulating lol
Even if Melvin is an evil motherfucker he still has to go by the law or he's going to jail and his boomer gay bear ass can't handle that much dick

I've got 50 shares on it. Best I could do when a fuck ton of my cash is in GME and Palantir
I wrote a DD 4 months ago and no one gave a fuck at $9 a share, none of the GME posts here are information or useful all just regurgitated retardation for precious reddit karma and award which is even Fucking sadder like that shit matters.
Once again, the assumption is I am a gambler. I am not.
As much as I enjoy the nonstop chatter about opportunities in the moment on market days, the weekends have actually been better for me because the shills are gone. Instead of shilling, people are just chilling. I've found most of my best moves from reading the weekend chat ☕
1 dude survives, DFV kills all of the gay bears
so they're saying it's not the ETFs that are the issue but the stocks they are representing?  Looking at some like ARKK and MSOS i clearly see a rise in value.  There is TAN and ICLN that had a massive drop off initially that they've never recovered from but that can be avoided by not jumping on from the get go.
Haha you guys literally robbed from the rich to give to the poor 🎯
I heard they did it behind the Wendy’s back in the day too
I have adopted similar approach. I only tell my closest brother who is also in the game

Congrats
Did they post memes with DD? Otherwise fuck them.
Man these kids would be really upset if they could read
This is the way
Guys only want one thing and and it’s tendies
What a leader.
Well then I might just be the asshole
It's time to get back into Lumber Liquidators
I didn’t see the VW comparison much until some person made a post about GME possibly infinity squeezing.
Manipulation is a hedge fund manager going on TV and saying the market is gonna crash keeping all the retail investors outta the market out of fear and then buying all sort of stocks on the cheap because they've been this sort of.scenario before.

#they are lying.

 they claim the jump already was the short squeeze, when in reality, it was all new long demand and the short position actually increased by 2%.
I vote this!
Nice timing man
Thank you, and thank you everyone else for explaining this to my autistic brain.

thank you. came here to say this. was a 60% day not enough? shorts could have easily covered. i sold as well

Currently sitting at 2065 shares with 3.5 average. I will not sell this stuff for years to come. Waiting till this hits 500 USD. Will pull out my initial investment once this hits between 50-100 USD
I love their RAM and cases, I don't like their gear at all, way better quality products out there, that don't glow in 1000 different colours in my honest opinion as an avid gamer.  
Zowie/SteelSeries for mice, Filco/Ducky/Leopold/Varmilio for keyboards, Beyerdynamics/Sennheiser haedphones and a mic > 'gaming' headset are way better options for me personally.  


I really don't see the hype for CRSR and value/growth in it myself at the moment. It is on my watchlist tho.
This post makes no sense. Lockup should bring a decent downward pressure on the stock price.

It's always the newest members who are the most paranoid and the most protective of this smol autistic corner of the internet. 

Just think of how you everyone finds wallstreetbets in the first place. Autism finds a way. Should we get blown up, we will find each other once again.
Is at this price because of the uncertainties, if you safe buy after the lockup the gain will be already gone, if so than you should play super long term.
Uncertainties = more risk but if things go well.... PLTR will moon the hell out of this world 🚀
We don't. Plus I think it'll be trading Monday on the Canadian stock exchange. Will see how that goes
Yeah. The company name is literally named after the seeing stone in lotr
Wait, are we not allowed to talk about Ford any more?

It may or may not be. Short interest is updated every 2 weeks. It is definitely still shorted we just don’t know how much yet.
What's LEAPs?  I don't see this mentioned in any of u/deepfuckingvalue posts.
Its legit dude. Go on thinkorSwim on the thinkBack feature. The contract price was trading at that price back then

Good question ⁉️ What are you setting yours to? 50 seem reasonable?
I don’t get actual gambling, all I know is that stonks only go up 🚀🚀🚀
Just like sentiment has been against GME. Undervalued businesses. Scared money don’t make money
Or when influential banks publish a X company should be worth Y dollars per share (short) but they don’t sell a single share.
So all shares are recalled during this period?
I've noticed WSB doesn't even know what a bear and bull is anymore.

Melvin Capital doing shorts on GME is a risky and bullish move... It's basically bulls fucking bigger bulls. Bears ideally don't gamble on options, especially shorts. It's value-oriented long stock buys that identify a bear who rotate to things like gold on a recession.

Either way, to the moon with you all. I'm just enjoying from the sidelines how many bag holders there will be once it all settles.
Definitely not my intention, but we all know Melvin has been playing a dirty game.
I completely agree, but I think we need a website much earlier than 2022. I think that if GME successfully infinity-squeezes this will be the end of WSB. Epic tendie gains and crushing of insitutional traders will put us into the media spotlight to a degree never seen before, which could have the following effects:

&#x200B;

1. Massive influx of new members which leads to an Eternal September phenomenon, permanently ruining WSB's culture and lowering the quality of DD.
2. Tutes getting angry with us for stealing their tendies and petition Reddit to ban us because of our use of non-PC spicy language.
3. Accusations of market manipulation and maybe a lawsuit.

&#x200B;

If we are to learn anything from the Parler debacle its that unless you are totally independant you are at the mercy of tech giants, and if tech giants decide they don't like you (or are paid by billionaires to not like you) they will fuck you until you turn into hamburger.

WSB needs independance, and quick, if we are to survive in the long run.
Fuck boy Cramer and the GME squeeze put this sub under a microscope if not now soon enough. Wealthy people only like tards that spend $ not take $.
Thats a good one dang
This is gay shit
That's crazy ...so which one?
Its impossible to know short term. I expect it will be wildly going up and down. Long term though is high probability win. Plan to hold for long.
Amen. I really think the meme game is funny but I wish we could purge those people and bring this sub back to what it was in 2018
Well this means one thing. Put on GME
As a german fellow, where can I trade calls or which trading app should I use?
Kinda same thoughts on BB for me. It will take a moment to take off, tbh I don't care how long it takes it'll make tendies
TLDR: Justin Fields is a paper handed bitch.

Love the "if I sold everything I'd own 1 tenth of 1 percent of Tesla".

Tesla is worth $800 billion so he's saying he has $800 million in his account. 1st wsb billionaire.
I think the best way to differentiate is if you are providing stats (DD, personal plays) and TELLING people to buy and hold.  The latter sounds like it can be construed as a pump and dump.

With that said, Mr FBI or SEC guy reading this, I'm only here for the memes.  Pls no arrest.

These "specialized ETFs lost about 4 percent of value per year, with underperformance persisting at least five years after launch."

My father died to cancer and before he was at his worst he changed his portfolio tactic to dividens. Thank God he did. Its a great income for my mom who has zero experience with money investment and hasnt worked for decades and has to take care of a house and kids. and incredibly stable. Mostly pharma, nestle and some insurance stuff. Could we be multimillionaires with a lucky investment ? Fuck yeah. could we lose a shitton of money. Yeah. This is just safety. i would personally use 10 k outta that for some risk play but at some point of wealth dividend is just the way to go. If you have family and want to provide for them even in worst case scenarios. 

&#x200B;

its better then any savings account and gonna provide stressfree/workfree money for decades to come
IMO, the mods are doing a great job keeping the sub clean. Exponential growth in the number of subscribers does come with some baggage, but the solution might not be to totally reinvent the wheel.

By legal definition of insider trading or market manipulation, how is this discernably different than Melvin Capital or Twitter influencers?
He will. Everyone is going to go quiet on this all winter. It may even dip after the next earnings, but come summer it will surge.
GME is going places. It will around 80 - 100 sometime this year.
I still don't know who melvin is
Yea, he tried to pump and dump probably, volume on CRSR is pretty low
You've obviously missed all the memes that clearly show Mel being a person. Why else would it be called Melvin Capital?🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Whenever you're happy with the returns, of course.
Add me in 🚀🚀
I love blasphemy
I’ll be honest, I sold most of my options yesterday at a 400%-600% gain. Also sold the little shares I had. People are getting greedy. Still holding a handful of contracts for the lulz and the meme.
Who you calling normal???
☕️🚻
I swear this sub has netflix documentary written all over it
You're selfish, buying shares helps the short squeeze and helps lift the price instead you are leeching off of everyone else hoping that they bought shares.

You didnt do anything for BB except try to make money off of your fellow wsbers.

Selfish. Hope that your calls expire worthless

So I should sell my BB shares next week.

They control the money tho

cant fleece granny if she ain't buying bro
Eh they were going green all week and ended green albeit minorly on a red day before a long weekend. I think next week it will correct
I stand for 1 and hover for 2.
is that normal that 1 option equalls 100 shares? or how do you get that ratio from what he posted?
Macro economic charts and historical data would indicate we're due for a illiquidity event.

Can we agree to collectively blast BB to the moon?? PLTR is also on the way...just needs a little time to percolate.

Also who thinks we will have a significant downturn in the near future? I’ve been selling everything but these two beasts due to the impeachment, overall run-up, fears of insurrection.....you know, all the fun stuff going on in our country.

Bill Ackman turned 27 million into 2 billion in a year. So that makes both of these guys look like pussies? See how retarded that is. Always bigger and better out there but everyday guys turning their accounts into millions should be given some respect.

The real way to make GME rise, and stay up, is to show to people how Cohen and whoever else has a real plan to keep the company alive and growing by pivoting strategy to online activities and new revenue streams. 

Trying to brute force Melvin and whoever else is short will fail in the end, they have deeper pockets than us Wendy’s employees. 

Long GME 🚀

This will be a project for this morning- printint out and going through my credit card statements to see where I'm spending money. So i can cut out things I don't use. And set up my bank account to automatically put more money into my RH account. 

I spend too much on random shit when I should be buying options.
[removed]
Categorize your budget before you get paid and physically write down every purchase you make in a note book. Color code your budget for month 2 and repeat.

I did this for like 5 months and it really got me to understand where my money went. I don’t budget every month any more, but the process drastically reduced my spending and increased my savings.
You really should have a spread of sell limits. You'll never ride the 🚀 if you never hit the sell. Sell limit of 800 sounds amazing until it only hit 799 and drops. Drop a little off every 100 so you can realize gains while also ride it up. Otherwise your 💎✋ will turn to coal as you fall back to Earth.

I do agree with the sentiment though. If we all raise your sell limit by 100, it can have an impact on the market. I currently am at 55@500 sell but will adjust based off the weekend.
Do it in premarket.
There are definitely some outsider actors. And i think thats hilarious that they have to watch autists move

I’ve used platanir in the marine school house and that shit was scary good at presenting data in a clear understandable way. No way the government would stop using their system unless someone comes with a better data aggregation. “First mover advantage” with the government helps since bureaucracy hates massive change so as long as they continue to integrate with the government systems they locked their future to a certain extent

I think Petco will eventually move into e commerce space either by investment or acquisition
God dammit the stonks don't run on holidays either.
I also bought at market open but I gonna load in shares every drop. This thing is insanely undervalued, 1 billion revenue at a valuation of 5 billion it’s nothing, every drop I gonna load on more shares. It is the same if you would have sold AMD at 10 dollars after it came back from 2 dollars. So hold and buy more.
GME is different though because it’s a short squeeze with the data backing it up.
These negative points are uncalled for lol sorry mate

Repositioned themselves, starting to pay off with the recent Sony deal. Established company with reputation for security, it’s a long play but can really fuckin pay off. This share gets shorted all the time but this last quarter hit different

Let me offer my opinion again: no one around here is manipulating any stocks! This is a forum full of degenerate retail buyers exchanging memes and fun posts. If I chose to invest my $10 in a certain stock because I like rockets, that’s my CHOICE at the end of the day.

Don’t bother too much about the SEC FUD being propagated, at times in a motivated way. They are a respected regulatory body, and probably know their job well.

I seriously suggest that you spend some time on Twitter, Stocktits, YouTube, Discord, Cramer shows; see what happens there and then come to your own informed conclusion on what constitutes manipulation. 

PS. Ah, and do read the fine print: “no investment advice is offered”
I got exercised on Tastyworks for the first time on my ICLN covered calls yesterday. Does the 100 x share price + premium come to my account on Monday? Both the option and the shares aren’t showing but my Net Liq isn’t showing the cash, but I’ve been having a few glitches with my balance between different their platforms so just wondering if anyone knows? Have a few orders working because I was expecting it to be there by open
That’s a beginner strategy. Send me your login and I’ll maximize your return on investment

True, no one will admit it but we need them to keep their shares. Calling them cucks if they sell won’t work when they see another 10% drop on Tuesday.
Kramer just talked about how it's illegal for him to buy anything Market related because of his job. He talked about investing in restaurants and especially liked his restaurant with a bar.

Yea exactly. SEC ain’t the biggest concern imo. 

Institutions taking over this sub through covert means is what scares me the most. WSB would have been perfect if it was make 100k size or something, but now its way too popular..its dangerous.

Although to be fair, sometimes the bigger the community, the harder it is to manipulate.

Fuck yeah dude. It's so much cooler when you didn't start with $100k to gamble with.
Who’s saying march?
Yeah but people did, that’s what I’m trying to say. We put a timer on a squeeze that no one knows when it’ll happen and people that got in yesterday or Wednesday are basing their dd on that.
Sneak peek at this upcoming week's submission log:

**GME. Get in here retards, here's why you should hold. Short hasn't started yet. Keep buying. Don't buy on margin! Set your sell limits at 100 so brokers can't borrow your shares! Keep holding! Buy more. Diamond hands. Rockets. Fuck you Melvin!**

and sprinkle in a little:

**PLTR. Get in here you retarded retards. It's a solid company. Very manipulated. It's about to break out. Believe in Cathie!**

with a side of:

**Cathie. Buy all the ARKs you fucking retards. ARKX is next. SPCE, to the moon,** ***literally*****.**

and a small cup of:

**BB. The squeeze is gonna happen, and it's actually a good company. Buy. Let's meme this to GME status.**

and several to-go boxes of:

**I'm in shambles.**
Just holding forever
Think I'm going to live like it's 1993 and go buy some comic books today
Shit, I'll buy some oversold boomer bank calls, why the fuck not. Thanks Jim!
This is that next level shit that keeps bring me back here.
You could try to post it in separate parts to identify which part is the reason for it being deleted
They’re naked shorting? They’re actually bigger retards than us lmao
The thing I don't get is why isn't an institutional investor just casually dropping in like 20 mil to buy half a mil of shares off the market and then reselling them to the shorters at a massive premium when the price inevitably pops?
this shit fucked up

What broker do you use?    
    How much do you normally put in each trade?     
    How many simultaneous trades do you jump in?
Back at the $2 dollar range you could have done this for leap calls and made bank on Nio. There is someone here who is. He turned $20-30k (not 1.5k) into around 4m so far, still has over a year on his leap still. His 20-30k from the 2020 lows could turn out to be a 7-8m dollar hit if he continues to hold.
[removed]
If the amount of institutional money in the market equals 10 fold of retail, then yes they control the market. Oddly enough with how the market has been behaving it seems like a few of them lurk right here.
This is true. I think the first line comes out next year. But, they've been teasing "big" announcements for 1Q this year

Edit: and decent potential for sure, but still very speculative
Godspeed, retard
You say it as if the dip came and went. Still plenty of dip to buy. Based on the most recent DD ive seen, there will be a dip to buy for maybe another 48 weeks while this next study wraps up.
So Papa Cohen is our Porsche?!?!?! 🚀🚀🚀🚀 he can fucking flex and just execute that 7%. Its a win/win for him
Might go down below $9, just hold and buy more shares Euroman! 🚀🚀🚀🚀

I hope it was the TSLA sale on Friday.
At this point, who cares. If it happens, it'll happen. You can't time a squeeze. GME is still massively undervalued, fundamentally. No where to go but up.

So I'm in for the rocket, but by the sounds of it this thing is getting really close to popping. Why doesn't one wealthy investor just dump everything they got and trigger the squeeze? If it was so close wouldn't someone smart with a lot of money see this and make it pop?
This is dumb
Alright, you seem like a person that would know this shit.🚀🚀
Sell low buy high they always say. It's my standard operating procedure anyway.
Insider trading is people revealing information not otherwise available giving one person or a group of people an unfair advantage. That does not happen here from what I have seen.

Market manipulation is more of a loose definition, but it definitely sounds apt when people here call to buy GME (collectively) to artificially inflate the price and force short holders to close their shorts.
Fuck the market maker who have sold these calls.

Yeah I’m sweet mandatory stop losses on some of my higher buys are around $23 so aslong as we don’t see a massive downward push before the squeeze I’m sitting pretty. 
You better know I’ve got another $1k transferred into my account to buy more if my SL are triggered around $23
This is me but my calls are for 1/29
I don't have any money left, 269 shares and 4 calls
Dude WSB is super cyclic. There was a lot of good DD with GME posted a while back, now were enjoying the [blank]-gang. 

A while back we were just just cash gang, moon gang, or bear gang every post. Just let GME hang have this and we will be back to normal soon.

Nothing here on the whole is illegal. They won’t ban this sub. There might be one or two comments with insider info but out of the 10s of thousands of comments it doesn’t imply a trend. 

The internet has been around a long time before wsb. Just look over at Twitter in the Fintwitterverse and see what can info those people are sharing.

I mentioned the subreddit to my dad with a quick description and he had that disappointed look on his face wondering where he went wrong.
This post is me calling out the bullshit. I think you’re right though, the retarded questions need to be met with more pushback. You couldn’t get away with asking some of the retried shit I’ve seen the last week when I first joined. Just too many people.
Yup.

It’s not insider trading or anything like that. 

But if you think a discussion here will move markets you’re sadly mistaken. Everything here is observation. This sub does not have the push to actually move a stock. Just invest in it.

U can by lurking
No doubts about it. They will study how we did the infinite money glitch in real live.
I sure fucking hope so. I was up 5 grand on my 1/29 calls at open and down to $700 at close...

So, to condemn 14 year old retards is effectively the same as biting the hand that feeds the tendies.

So right they are pumping BB to make retards paperhand GME and go into BB

The amount of brand new accounts on Friday going "Hello fellow trades, BB to the moon, here's a screen shot of the stock going straight down after the hype died down"
The basic plan over here is basically if you’re at fault and you’ll fuck up we’ll pay. Other than that you’re in your own

Ok, but shorting a stock 140% is fair game? We're short squeezing the fuck outta these gay bears and nothings gonna stop us
9/10 times the earnings are priced in this close. Buy the rumor, sell the news.

30% pa for a short on a parabolic stock isnt that much. Thats not HTB. QS had 970% or some shit like that.

Those WSBs who have not bought GME, buy some and support the team.   This includes me, as I didnt realize how powerful and true our team is.  Buy some shares as there are 2 million of us.  If everyone  can buy just $100 of GME, thats $200 million in short squeeze.  I want WSB to show its full force and this is the start of WSB Team plays.  

I'm buying GME on Tuesday and if your a true retard I  expect you to buy GME too.  This isn't r/investing or r/stocks, We are WSB!  Get on the team or get the fuk out.  I love you guys.

Wonder what this week will look like. Market is still adjusting to what a President Biden will look like in terms of stimmy, tax, regulation, etc. Think it will be another flat and sideways week, with some more bleeding. 

Just guessing of course. 

So I'm not going to buy anything until maybe thursday or friday. i want to see if TSLA keeps dropping. I want to put more money into tSLA calls as well, but the sideways action is painful and these are expensive. So gonna wait and see for a bit. 

Maybe I will roll out my calls to summer.
Short $8 put gang... hoping to get assigned.
Hehehe!
Nah, never happened. The biggest media moguls are not also partners in some of the biggest investment banks. That'd be fucking ridiculous. Congress and the PotUS, who definitely don't partake in insider trading and work for the people, would surely put an end to such a positive feedback loop in our fair and equal markets.

Lots of Boomer materials stocks (RIO, X, NTR, SCCO, SQM) have been slaying and probs will continue to do so if we are really in a commodity super cycle which I believe we are. Just look at the last commodity supercycle in 08. Gotta love those parabolic moves in these stocks.

I mean, sure you can, but I would not expect NIO to go 10x like Tesla did for the last 13 months.

Tesla is a lot more than a car company, maybe Im wrong, but NIO from the little i know is a car company. They already have a market cap at about 90B.

No way NIO will go 8-10x from today. If NIO deliveres they might go 2x, maybe 3x for the next 5 years.

&#x200B;

I can of course be wrong a 100%. People said same about Tesla, but they forgot that Tesla is so much more than their Model 3, S, Y and X.

Just take all things into consideration. People are so hyped about EV's today and think every EV company will be the next Tesla. Just be careful is what Im saying! Good luck on all your investments q:)-<-<
$100m is like half of $SNOW’s annual revenue... I’d say it was relatively significant.
I can see either way. These days having a hedge is not crazy.
I am going to exercise my options!

Fuck you Melvin. 💩
What was the actual cost of the option on the day you bought it and actual strike, back then before the split? Post split it was trading at $60 but pre-split would have been, what $240? So was your cost $1.50 for 10 options contracts? What was the delta?
Unusual options activity and later that day the product developer at Salesforce followed the ceo of dropbox. yeah I do some serious detective work.

What contract are you referring to? As part of Ryan Cohen and the other 2 board members being appointed? If part of them being appointed was them receiving shares, they could have just obtained these from the free float I assume. These three directors somehow being forced to sell their shares also doesn't seem likely to me, but what do I know.
Hold, this is a long play. Don’t be an idiot. If you’re going to have paper hands than you shouldn’t be playing in the market in the first place. Honestly, just fucking google BB. And if you can’t see the long term intrinsic value and then you deserve to lose money.
Sure, but if a few hundred of us got together and started a legit biz group/company for acquisition of small companies to hold/promote it's increasing value etc while scheming in a board room instead of on a public fucking forum, then we're just being businesspeople...
This is retarded and clearly the shorts have infiltrated wsb. Delete this trash.

They do have a delivery date. There has been a very large amount of GME shares that have been failed to deliver since December. That is what they could be talking about.
This is the play!

Everybody that has a heart and is young does. As an older dude my goals have simplified. Good food, good wife, a bit of freedom and flexibility with my time, not seriously sweating money, a few hobbies I enjoy and a couple of buddies to laugh with.

I'll wear my slippers and pink shorts to the store if I want, suck my dick! They are comfortable!
I do agree. Latley WSB has gotten a bit "too much" with 50 post a day about GME, now BB.

I believe in the Technicalities my brother. 

Don't get me wrong though, clearly I sold SOME if you look at my picture but fuck me had i HELD i wouldve made 20k+

Anyway, If you're holding long dated options far ITM like myself I would keep holding because fuck it why not GME can fall back to 30 but our 23$c and 25$cs will still print for us so I don't mind leaving sum money on the table if it means riding this shit to the very peak.

Someone said this earlier and went something like, Its nice to sell for 300% profit but it must hurt to see it go to 1000% profit if you know you couldve made 300k or 1million, which one would you want? 

Again, if you have short dated contracts PLAY DIFFERENTLY but holding these bad boys til expiration date no joke lol

I used vanguard, their own boomer platform, to fuck them.
Liquidity is never a problem with deep ITM call options close to expiry, thanks to arbitrage bots and the fact that you can mostly ignore extrinsic value, because it's close to 0. Even on the most illiquid bid /asks chains with absolutely no bids whatsoever, you just do the following: figure out the current stock price and substract the strike. Now substract 2-3 cents as a fee of sorts for the bots. Post that as a limit order and I guarantee you as long as the underlying is liquid, bots will eat your order and exercise it immediately after (it's free money). You can of course also exercise it yourself and save 2-3 dollars per lot, but you need the cash to buy the shares at the agreed strike price.
Thats more than 3/4 of these people have info wise when they make trades. So if you believe it, go for it.

The fucked up thing about that is NIO would be a great stock to invest in if posts like that hadn’t shown (in the comments section) that it’s a company directly tied to an arm of the CCP (JAC) and they willfully, openly manipulate their own market. 

I think long term NIO would be an ok investment, but that post was sus as fuck, and a sliver of DD would show it doesn’t pass the sniff test.

More than are on WSB. Even if an unreasonably large percentage of the 1.8m people here (say 20%) are in for an average of a few thousand dollars each, you only control maybe $1bn of the cap. Actual number is probably way lower.  Shorts are maybe 3x that according to the reports. 

So you still need an external catalyst of some sort to put more action on the buy side. That's why a squeeze hasn't happened yet. Insiders and the media probably helped this week, but you're waiting for another shoe to drop somewhere.
Me and you have different definitions of short
definitely. when something goes 8x in a few months im hesitent to get back in.

i dont even like holding that shit overnight.

Bump this crap
I think he’s referring to the daily’s.
Thanks for the write up, but I have one suggestion. On your point bout the directors, we know exactly how many shares and at what price they were sold. Look up the recent filings on the Sec website. Look at form 4. 

I think it’s also super important for you to mention that the directors who sold (excluding Kurt Wolf who represents Hestia) are outgoing directors and will not be running again for director roles. This was explicitly mentioned in the agreement with RC Ventures. 

Secondly, I think you should list the total amount of stock that was sold by the directors (it wasn’t a huge amount) and how many are still owned by those same directors after they sold (this is also clearly spelled out in the form 4.)

What I don’t want is people to think the directors are selling their shares because they know something the rest of us Don’t. It’s not that at all. They’re lame duck directors now and really are no longer going to be part of the company. Thanks.

Ok so reading that enphase & solar edge sell off was due in part to Tesla building their own solar inverters in  combination with broader market sell off . Just curious if anyone follows someone on Twitter that had the Tesla news as it flew under the radar & ppl I follow didn’t .

Could SEC really investigate r/wallstreetbets. For pumping and dumping stocks and “insider trading” cause at least in my troglodyte esc brain I see this Sub as a free means of discussion about publicly available information. 

Also Melvin capital (🤮) has been doing everything in its fucking power to blow the shit out of GME and that at least to me seems slightly sus. 

Also you could probably make the case that Cramer was pumping GME on cnbc (I know he can’t own the stocks he picks ). 

Conclusion- I think this sub is pretty innocent of anything the SEC could accuse us of, it’s not like u/DeepFuckingValue is Ryan Cohen lol. 

But I think we shouldn’t be getting pre pubescent fucktards yoloing there lunch money or shitty stocks especially if they have no fucking clue what they are doing lol.
Where is the coordination? Go look at your trading app and tell me if they don't have buy/hold/sell advice for each stock, this is no different.

Pump and dumps may not happen on $2500M companies. Do the math on a business with $13M capitalization. Or a $35M and low average trading volume. There are [some](http://www.smallcapdirectory.com/Search.aspx?k=&con=a&e=NASDAQ&i=&mcmin=-1&mcmax=-1&c=&ld=0&lk=&t=&ri=0&ps=25) with low capitalizations.

Working out well for now. Up 50%.
Not if those people sold covered calls, as presumably most did (doing otherwise would be as retarted as shorting without an hedge). Then when push comes to stove, you have the call writers selling for cheap their shares for a fixed price to the shorters. Sure they'll forfeit a bunch of profit, but is there any buying pressure whatsoever in this scenario?

Agree on all these points. The stock has clearly been manipulated by short sellers, I mean even with all the great contracts, the really good interview by Alex, ark picking up a solid position, and even some analysts putting a 30 target on it, we yet to break to $30.

Too much people coming in from r/All and Cramer. It's indeed getting annoying, but it'll die down in a few months, I'm hoping.
Agreed, but this was more like a one in a million event.
You know guys a few day ago I just wanted to make money from GME but it is actually feels good to be part of something big. It fills me with good vibes that we can break down these old fart boomer suit pirate corporate egoistic clowns. They think they can control everything with their big money, if the short squeeze will really happen I will tell this tale even to my wife's and her boyfriends's grandchildren one day. I love you all.
Shuttle loop!
Bad bot
literally cannot understand calls no matter how many times i watch a 3 hour video on it so i just dump all my money into whatever meme stock we are pushing today. so far its worked ok but i think this is only a factor of our times. 
$MT 116 shares (cant buy more because its de listed) and not fucking selling

Shares, leaps
When the stock was $4, short interest was around 100%. 

Most shorts have been short since sub $5 or $6
She's locked in.
Buy some shares man.

> Many, many people here smart, experienced, and doing you a favor by even posting their DD. It's your job to shut the fuck up, pay attention, and filter the bullshit from the useful shit and then make educated decisions.

He’s absolutely right. This place is absolutely amazing, and I do not want it put in jeopardy. The sheer amount of work involved is taken for granted. I’ve done DD on my own, spending hours researching people, products, and building timelines around circumstances on who to invest in, only to come to this sub and find someone posting here with DD that blows mine out of the fucking water. 

And them some snot-nosed little shit clicks one time, and thinks he’s so smart for knowing what he does. It’s infuriating. Kids, be quiet, be respectful, and be grateful for what’s happening. It probably won’t last, so make hay while the sun shines.

If GME doesn‘t reach $50 EOM, I‘ll lick peanut butter off of my dogs dick
I was hoping it was going to make a squeaky sound like a dog toy...
Sorry, no haters allowed on the moon
I really like your point in general but I don't think that the SEC is the problem. It will be very hard to construct something that really goes against their rules because, lets's be frank, most people on this board are really retards which have no clue what they are doing. Currently the market goes up and people are celebrating, however, one small crash and people WILL loose and cry. 

HOWEVER, if we target a company which is advertising heavily on reddit, or in another way may be afraid of negativ publicity getting connected to WSB. Reddit will pull the plug over night!

Autists: The Thick Helmet
I’m throwing everything into anything ARK.
Definitely want to make a point against VW Squeeze vs GME Squeeze, fundamentally theyre the same, with the key difference of only 13% shares were shorted. Gme is well over 100%. The shares you own, the shares i own, are all shorted shares. There is not a single share on the market in GMEs outstanding share that isn't short. AND they all will have to be bought back. 100 ps5s and 130 obligated  ps5 buyers. Last one out is the 🌈est🐻. Gl fellas. Hold on tightly. 420.69 is within our grasps.
Double zero yolo
True. What do you think’s DPV price target for this squeeze? He has to take some profits, no? Or is he  actually invested in the company for long run? He can sell at the top of the squeeze, say 500 ea share then buy back in.
Also if they’re able to push down prices enough that new buyers may get margined. I think rumor is SEC 201 activated on GME so it’s pretty double sided now.

What confused me is short interest actually increase? So are they essentially going to average down the cost basis of their shorts? If most new ones are 19, and they managed to open at the top, they only need to take it past 30 plus interest cost of borrowing shares
Short shares don’t expire. You pay interest on them as you go.
I don’t get it. Why are ppl buying GameStop? It sounds like a company without a future?

Look up what shorting shares is first
What’s the best way to make an impact with 10k on GME?

Buy pure shares or 2023 calls for GME?
bB needs a reverse split too many OUS
It would be a $25million pump if they all did it on the same day, which would move a $2500 million business by 1%, assuming no selling whatsoever and then thats it, youre all in.
... The VW shortsqueeze put a notable firm into bankrupcy, the financial domino effect of their unpayable debts are thought to have likely begun a slow-rolling financial crisis if they government didn't bail them out.

&#x200B;

And Wiedeking was regarded a genius and financial engineer. I'm not so sure they'll take WSB so lightly if we actually manage to put Melvin under.
> I was eyeing an extremely similar trade which would have netted close to 400MM

You would have 100% cached that in earlier. Or closed that due to the corona panic in March at an unfavorable price. It really takes ernourmous will power to hold past 100%, 500% or 1000% and the big drawdowns inbetween. And more often than not, realizing these absurd gains at these points turns out to be the correct move later too. I imagine it hurts even more to see some small lotto ticket reach 1 million that then evaporates, than missing out on even more absurd gains.
*Sigh*

It's very obvious *when* they sold if you actually read the form 4 for each of the directors. Public information and what not. And also it's not a big deal. At all. Minor profit taking from people who've been bagholding since the low singe digits. A drop in comparison to the total volume traded over the past days. 

Also the news had barely any impact as it was announced after market open and it was already going down.
GME gang are wiped Tuesday, and everything will be back to normal.

Noobs buying their first options on GME because they saw it on WSB... The greed is real.

I prefer to hear he upped his shares significantly, reducing the shares available on the market. Which was Porche's strategy in the Volkswagen squeeze.

Borrowing the stock along costs 18.7%.... probably one of the highest borrowing costs out there
Well...I'm from Europe (and others like me, around here) and I'm 600 shares deep into GME. So the reach of this thing is big.
Amazon had a PE ratio of 3000+ in 2014. Amazon would still have been a good investment then. People argued "they would have to sell all the books in the world" to meet that PE ratio but failed to realize they were going to sell other things soon much like Tesla and take a much larger share of other markets.

I understand your point, but calling our economy centrally planned is so insanely hyperbolic that it makes you sound like a naive 17 year old that just took their first AP macro class. It’s a term that is well defined and the US objectively is not even close to being a centrally planned economy.

Woke up still drunk...but skipped gym yesterday....decisions decisions
To be fair this is part of exactly what confused me in the beginning. Is it possible to roll over short share expirations as easily as you can do with options now?
I feel he same way. Its cheap fundamentally, amazing recover story with Ryan Cohen and a big chance a short squeeze will happen in 1/2 weeks.
Also, a 100% short interest will 100% squeeze if Gamestop and Ryan Cohen will begin their turnaround. It might not happen in 1/2 days like VW but it will be more like Tesla, with ~20x as much short interest. ( I believe it was like 5/6% for tesla)
Yeah bro, I got your back
I feel like GME is in the same dip now as VW was just before the squeeze, genuinely think we might see it happen Tuesday, then again I might be retarded and it goes tits up.

I know the difference between opinion and claiming facts has become a bit blurry in the last couple years, but there is a difference.

If the share price goes under the strike price of the option, and it is close to expiry, the price of the option will become close to zero. So he won't be able to sell the options to get any money back. Nothing will happen.

Not sure how margins will affect this.
Yup fall asleep just fine.

I've done really well with OTM LEAPs.. Why not buy them? The price premium, I guess? I like having the option of being able to wait until I'm right, which in this market, seems to always happen eventually.
look at the volume on wed/thurs, something like 200m combined? that was the bulk of the institutional buy. at this point, wsb doesnt even need to diamond hands to force the gigasqueeze. the big boys will do it for us.

Fidelity doesn't let you set a limit order higher than 50% of current price. And since the price goes up the less shares there are to buy at low prices, I think it would be better to not list at 50% because it would further squeeze the market. Setting limit to 50% just doesn't seem to help the squeeze imo
Why not out of the money? I buy out of the money all the time and I profit.

And another WSBer reaches millionaire status... This sub is really turning its reputation around and quickly becoming the place where the biggest success stories are coming from.
Alright but here is my thought. I totally agree with everything you said except on the GME play. this is because GME is so synthetically shorted. As many of us Know, short positions cover more shares than there are within the company, and short positions are only increasing with a rise within share price. Even if price drops back to 20, or 15, I’ll probably just buy more because this is bound to happen again. There are 1)too many people shorting this stock - brokers cannot cover all of thier positions in the first place because there are not enough shares — and 2) this company has too much upside potential. With a positive influx of good news, there is going to be constant pressure against the shorts and they will collapse eventually. And when they do, it’s going to be catastrophic for them, and lucrative for us bulls. If you are going to get in with this GME hype, buy and hold for long term, or sell once you have doubled or tripled your money and secure a profit. I sold when the first run up happened, and I then reinvested some of my money in to hopefully catch a second runup. It is looking less likely at this point, but that is fine - it still could happen and we don’t know what news is going to come out over the weekend. One strong article might be all it takes. And if it drops? I’ll just buy more and wait for this to happen again because anytime there is so much synthetically drivin resistance on a stock, it is bound to crumble hard as long as the stock shows continued upside potential. I think GME is a great play... the only difference is i look at the next year - 5 years, rather than the next day / week. If you are going to get into GME, I wouldn’t buy calls or outs because it is too hard to predict. I instead would just buy and hold shares of the compony

I dun seen the wolf 'o wall street I know insider tradin's when ya strap cash to a hot blonde slavic gal and she takes it to swisscheeseland.

Er hold on. I also seen 'Merkin Made with Tom Cruz and he buried the moneys in a farm. That's a good insider trading trick too I heard.

NEwaze this is too much readin' on the wall street gamblin' innanet so i had ta post to fix all the erras.
Just realized markets are closed on Monday.

I'm definitely getting a nervous breakdown as we reach tuesday.
If it makes you feel any better, I had a limit order at $34. Day low: $34.01

My limit order held the floor, but I will be reloading my account with more cash and blow my load next week. All of it.

These guys are doing options or owning the stocks which is different to cfds. As you got in early on them I think you are golden? Could be wrong
This question used to never gets answered and it was understood by EVERYONE to never give the actual answer. Fuck this place now and fuck you.

Maybe there is a lawyer among us, who can lay out what constitutes insider trading and market manipulation?! The DD is amazing, but you’ll also have to understand that it is one single perspective on a certain company/ industry. As long as there is no one posting their internal strategy deck, I’m fairly certain that there is no insider information being traded. As to market manipulation, out of every ten people claiming their are following a call to buy, sell, short etc, there is probably only 1 person actually following through with it. We might be taking ourselves too serious.
Biden used a racial slur the other day when he said ‘beyond the pale’ - The Pale was the white English part of Ireland and beyond the pale was where they said dangerous mongoloids live (Irish people)
AMD will do great leading up and maybe shortly after earnings. Looking at the long charts and earnings patterns. Diamond fuxking hands. 110 calls 2/05 and 3/19 100c 1/29. 💎💎💎💎💎🙌🙌🙌🙌🙌🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

I started lurking here in November and even I feel a difference now with this heavy attention in the media n shit. Not cool
Sorry but it’s not illegal nor anywhere as such. There is no inside information being pushed that I know of. 

This is no different than your local boomer stonk investment club that meets at the senior center to discuss Blue Chips that earn measly dividends. 

Go to investing or those other boomer subreddits...

Absolutely fair enough 😂 although that post was in 14 Jan '20 and one month later we got a 50% decline... just forget about the rally after that. The put strategy I suggested then would have printed 🤷‍♂️
I mean the chances of this happening at the time you bought this is literally the same as a lottery ticket so...
You’re not going to get good answers here. It’d be like stumbling into the pit lane at a NASCAR race and asking the engineers how to drive. Google and youthbe. Investopedia. Plenty of resources out there.

But if you sell puts and it's the MMs buying on the other hand, they hedge it by buying shares proportionally to the delta, right? So in a sense you still do indirectly contribute to someone buying shares.
So I have 1000 shares of GME through Fidelity, I would like to set the limit to 1000$ but Fidelity obviously doesn't allow that. Can I stop them from borrowing or should I just leave the shares be until we get to a higher price

Tesla options have always been notoriously expensive, I remember looking at them years ago (like 2016-ish) and being shocked at the premium. There is absolutely zero possibility he picked up those 10 contracts for 1.55, 15 months out, at 110% above the spot. I could maybe believe 15.5 but 1.55 is a fantasy.

Agreed, I know people joke about the SEC but they are a real fucking concern. With the stock market at stake (or even just one company) its nothing for them to come down on this sub. Also, its important to watch people purposefully pulling you in a bad direction here. GME is prime example of a good bet on a short squeeze, other stocks people pump are not so great to say the least
Wtf IB? Why didn't you tell me my sgen was upgraded you Fucking pos

57% of my invested money is in sgen. Now I worry about the covered calls I sold
Do we really expect the squeeze to happen next week? With the shorts doubling down, and the sec uptick rule in effect.
Interesting. How was trading VW a week before? A month before?
That actually makes a ton of sense. Thanks.
Everyone use their mad gains from GME to pay for a VPN. 

If they ban the sub we will move to [wallstreetbeets](http://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbeets).  Half of us can't read anyway, so the name doesn't matter.  The SEC will think we're a couple hundred thousand beet farmers.  This literally can't go tits up!
long term after the squeeze where do you feel the company actually sits at? I can't see it being a genuinely triple digit stock unless it pivots successfully and I'm not 100% sold on cohen just yet

Experienced surfers know when waves are forming. They don't form the waves; they ride them.

Maybe WSB can generate a bigger wave by getting other surfers to ride it. Most times the few smart people point to a wave forming.
To add to /u/6r1n3i19 's great comment I would recommend checking out his YouTube channel (Roaring Kitty). You'll see that this man has done his homework and shared it along the way. He's been open on his theory that GameStop's fundamentals are getting better as the gaming industry grows and as they're modernising the company. 

[Watch the analysis he did here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GZTr1-Gp74U&t=0s) and you'll understand that a lot of thought went into this. Again despite the gains that the man has already made, and will make short term, buying and holding long-term will benefit him too.

More reason to ban anyone that makes comments like that. False flagging us. Or put a restriction if you haven't posted or commented here from 6 months ago you are flat out banned from putting anything here.
Gooo
Typical dip happens around 10. There's been another around noon when traders go to lunch. But who the fcuk knows. If you buy though, plan to hold for one year at least. I will be choppy.
"shut us down" is not possible bud, but I understand your concerns. Reddit gets shut down we all go somewhere else, it's a mentality of the group not just the website
Yeah the past two days of wsb interest have made it go crazy at open then taper off towards noon. You'll get more for your money if you wait til the afternoon imo.
1 option contract is for 100 shares. So like the other commenter says, 50 calls gives him the right to buy 5000 shares for the strike price.
Here I'd been reading it as Deep Dive.
BB Has major potential long term. People are just retarded and thought I would literally 10x in price after a conference (which we ended up crashing). Or would be the same as GME. There have been plenty of good DD on BB as a long play.
Is it still worth getting into GME at 35?

Don't just look at the fucking prices. The situations with share holdings aren't even similar. Look at the amount of shares shorted and the borrow rates on as many brokers as you can to get a feel.
How is that different to investment firms organising a pump and dump by changing to a buy order or rating the investment to 5 stars instead of 4. 

Or Cramer plugging stocks. 

Perhaps the mods could enforce the telling of positions to allow for clarity.  But there is no way of knowing exactly what our positions are.  

Even if I was investigated for market manipulation for commenting GME to $420.69 or bust.  I could be living in a country like Turkmenistan using a VPN on a burner reddit account.

Wtf the Volkswagen squeeze was a fucking wild ride:

On Monday morning Volkswagen's ordinary shares opened at €348, up 66 per cent from Friday's close, and kept rising. The shares closed at €517: a 149 per cent gain in the space of one day's trading.

For those who had not squeezed out the fire escape, the worst was yet to come.

The first tick on Tuesday was a touch lower — €497 — before the shares took off again, rocketing to an intraday high of €999, before easing off to €940 at close. For those who sold a share short on the Friday, the losses were brutal. If they had borrowed €100m of stock, it would have cost them €450m to buy it back. 

On Wednesday 29, Porsche, perhaps realising their actions had caused some damage, generously provided an extra 5 per cent of the shares to the stricken shorts. By Friday, Volkswagen's ordinaries closed at €497, down 50 per cent from the Tuesday highs as the squeeze loosened.

It’s Monday. It’s six in the evening, and you stare at your computer, bored out of your mind. You open the home page to Twitch and find a live stream from...is that GameStop? It is. And it’s Ryan Cohen talking. You click on it immediately, and the first words you hear are “ - to become an EV company.” That’s all you needed to be required to change pants. The entire chat is flooded, and then WSB is throwing a party while the shorts shiver in fear. Tuesday morning comes. The market opens, and the stock price drove up to $60 without any move from the shorts. You hold. It goes up to $100. You still hold. The shorts are sweating. You’re watching Cohen’s speech on Youtube on repeat, and $GME keeps going up. $200. $400. $694.20. $1000. 
“Please. Let me buy it for $1000,” you imagine Melvin pleading. 
“$2000.” He nods furiously, tears brimming as he forks over the cash. You walk away, from both Melvin and your job that day. Retired on a Tuesday, all thanks to DeepFuckingValue and you for believing in a company with forty-thousand employees at risk of losing their jobs.

True. If SEC can prove Cramer was attempting to manipulate the market for person gain, he would have some bigger problems.

No insider knowledge needed if attempting a coordinated pump and dump of some small company. If that's happening, some peeps may get a knock on the door.

If you want definitely do something I would take a wild guess and talk to your local bank service and maybe you can open a depot directly where you normal salary account is.

Granted the fees will be ugly but it might be possible, because it's a boomer thing to do. 

First of all check with them what time it would take for the depot boarding process. Maybe you can use it Monday to get the stuff up and running, before moass might be happening on Tuesday or later.

Yes US markets are closed on Monday for European traders as well.
If I work for company X and come here and start spewing positive vibes or "I heard their sales will be through the roof next quarter" that would be a problem. If I tell my young nephew to post some rumor, that would be a problem.
He probably can't do that sort of thing after joining the board.

Yes, I have the cash, but you raise a good point. I would need to either buy it on margin or sell other positions. I wonder if RH allows you to exercise and buy shares using margin or it needs to be cash on hand.

Never thought I'd ever want to exercise an option, so never considered these things... 🤔

No, for the greatest crime of all. Autism.
trailing stop loss is a great tool, but recommending it for the GME trade is a mistake. When stock is heavily manipulated as in this case, they force trailing stop losses to pop making their own mini squeeze. So do not do this, it is a mistake, on wednesday they'll take advantage of anyone who uses this.

Fake, those contracts couldn’t have been .31 as the underlying stock was $200 higher than his strike. Sorry TSLA leaps 14 months out ITM. Would be $300 based on the IV. Ghetto math but it’s not possible. If he had like the June 2019 low $1500 calls of something then sure. Had he done a better job researching before photo shopping it be more plausible.
they'll lower the amount you can buy on margin  to 0 percent for risk. buy calls or buy in cash account. otherwise you get fucked
You can buy 100k worth of shares with just 70k. With 100% margin requirement you need 100k to buy 100k

Isn't it funny how Cramer keeps shouting reddit every fucking day in the morning? On national fucking tv watched by millions of people? Cramer, who has been the bitch of hedge funds, billionaires, and other billion dollar institutions for all these years is suddenly OUR friend. Suddenly rooting for US. 

The idiots here think what they are doing is funny. They think this is it, they are the institution now. I have pointed this out before as well but I am the paranoid retard because look at what happens at stocktwit and twitter and whatnot.

I found this interesting on Yahoo Finance. 

“GameStop GME just added 3 new board members on Wednesday, and the WSB's 'degenerates' (along with an institutional short-squeeze) drove the stock up 60% (100% at one point) because they have been waiting for any hint of bullish news about GME to catalyze a buy.”

Due diligence. I talked to someone on Chat Roulette about this, he only seemed concerned with meme stocks and seemed confused about what the OTC market is. He was also in the red quite a bit.  His due diligence ended at a meme, dont be that guy.
yes different stonks could do it for sure but the trick is to find a stock that will go up 15x in a year or so and with cheap options that are 2.5x OTM

BABA for instance, a year out the $460s are selling for $3 so 10 would cost 3k

Its at $240 so the stock has to go to $3600 by next year, each call would be worth roughly 340k so 3.4 million

3k to 3m after taxes in 1 year but the stock has to hit $3600 lol

Now maybe people will realize TSLA should not be at $4000 (presplit value) its retarded as fuck. Massive bubble and when it pops the stonk will be back under $100 a share post split value.

I might even use the TSLS $110 puts as a hedge this year, $2300 insurance policy against BS happening.
I'm holding Intc shares since July (42 @$51.7), I think I can hold a bit longer. I deserve some tendies for my diamond hands.
This makes me feel a bit better.  Bought mine at 37.99 right before it dipped, was feeling a bit dumb, hahaha.
To all the newbs:  Yes, options are guaranteed ways to make $1 mill in a day and no there's no risk at all if you aren't a pussy

Honestly, if you can buy GME before the squeeze, do it and hold. It might not be possible since the could come as early as Tuesday/Wednesday but if you can get in do it and HOLD. This is really important: HOLD.
This just beat all other posts on here.

GME 60c 1/22

Retarded or smart?
Just a fyi as far as I'm aware you can't trade options on Etoro? (Brit here and the last week since this started I've been trying to sus this space out).

All of these guys as far as I'm aware are trading calls via options on this stock OR own the stock (I went for this in the end). 

For us we are stuck with CFDS (Maybe that's just in degenerate uk?) Which are pretty risky especially if they are cfds on options. At this point if i was youd if just buy the stock at 50 on open and hope it's the MOASS and get out when you want.

On what grounds would the sec come after him? For being retarded?
I got yah...it just feel like not that long ago in 2018, everyone was taking about it hitting $420 as a meme stock. But I see it was probably cut in half for the split, and shows a false impression. Either way whoever got into TSLA before 2020 is doing well. I’ve been lurking since 2017 or so on WSB. But only started investing late 2019. I do look here time to time, and stockwits for real time discussion during open hours. 

I do really appreciate the breakdowns looking at your account posts. I’m still personally trying to grasp a lot of things. I feel WSB posts a lot of loss/gain porn, meme stock ect. With no reasoning, so it’s nice to see it broken down. Not to give people the wrong impression. I’ve had a few stocks from speculation on here. Where I’ve just pretty much waited months to break even. Or made very little, and was a short squeeze. It’s good to show the math and reality of it.

It really is. The stock market is also a sponge that is only porous some of the time. But stimulus also isn't a single direction thing on inflation either apparently. And the bloody pandemic generally increasing savings for some and wiping others out.

I personally think the last one is enough to disrupt the economic cycle entirely, another two year extension at least which is ridiculous given how long this bull has run. Who knows though man, might as well read chicken entrails. Take any opinion as only one among many.

Yeah sell them to me at 34, and i’ll sell them back to you at $340.
To point is not to "succumb" to them, it's to understand that there's a real world out there and that it has rules, and that blatantly breaking the rules in an illegal (or close enough to illegal to be actionable) way is about 99.99999% more likely to result in you getting fucked and leaving the big boys untouched than it is some huge win for the little guy.

Calls are a proxy to owning 100 shares. Therefore when margin calls hit, brokerages will pay any and all prices to get shares, including your retarded options, so they should stay liquid through the event.

Thanks for the clarification. From
the other post it seemed like this was recent. All the same, 1.8M shares with them does add to a slightly smaller float, along with Cohen’s holdings and the etf/index holdings for our calculations.

I wouldn't be surprised if they get bought out. Their FCF ain't bad and they do have enough cash. Short term debt can be converted to long-term debt and that would shot the stock up a good 30%. Don't miss such move and don't doubt CFOs

Insider trading is using information that isn't available to the public to gain an advantage. 

How can we have insider knowledge when we have no knowledge at all. 

We could potentially be done for market manipulation, but no more than any of the investment firms changing their recommendations from buy to sell, or Cramer advising to avoid or buy certain stocks.

I think the consensus is there will be a short squeeze. The prize action we have seen this week is thought to be only the beginning.

10% is nothing compared to what will really happen if the squeeze of squeezes is about to happen
When I started, I'd see a spike upwards, felt like I missed the train, feel sorry for myself for a while, and then I'd fomo at the top and paper hands on the dip.

With the articles people are writing, I think there is just an influx of newbies. Rather than people who read a funny post and are compelled to join, they’re here after reading actually boring boomer news and investment articles. So we’ve got ... idk ... no offence but some of the wrong people here. 

Additionally, I think there could be a portion of trolls who are using accounts to deliberately try to fuck us, genuinely, I feel out of jealousy and spite.
Pets.com went online too. All A bunch of bull crap.
You people have said this when it was 12, then 15, then 19 etc. Like that durado retard who ended up deleting his acc cos he was so wrong
I'm glad you took the time and effort into researching the price levels. I'm not sure you know this so I apologize if it comes across as basic, but what you're looking at is likely a chart with price adjustments post split. Its done this way to avoid confusion, which in itself can at times do just the opposite. 

Congrats on your picks. Cheers to continued success in '21

When he sells those it’s going to be like $5billion in taxes. The dems should be cutting a deal with him to reduce the deficit!

when I said $50 I mean the stock price btw not strike prices, I have ITM options mostly with a little exposure outside of the money. Stock prices will probably open at ATHs which is why I said $50, and if it goes down because 201 expires and we don't get margin call then it probably drops back down to whatever it opens at on tuesday
I bought 120 shares @ $8.something, I was up $300 in the morning, averaged up to $9.8 buying 130 more shares. Lost all the gain and sold everything before close. Fuck BB and fuck me for my stupidity

You have the right formula but it depends if you use GAAP eps or their eps without the green credits. 

Also depends if you use fully diluted share count (including all the crazy options Elon has) or current outstanding shares

That’s why you’re seeing different numbers. Either way it’s huge. Like over 1400

But Tesla is now a self sustaining machine. The higher the price goes the easier it is to raise cheap capital and the more successful the company can be
What’re the odds DFV is worth more than this shill ass fuk 🐻

Why?
[removed]
The squeeze was pure manipulation - there were no fundamental changes to the company that triggered the squeeze. It was simply an announcement that a majority of shares were locked up. Also recall this was on the eve of the huge market crash.

GME would be a much more "honest" squeeze: actually crazily over-shorted, catalyzed by real changes to company management and direction, shares owned by a myriad of investors instead of one group of manipulators.

I’m not cash, I’m all in UVXY. I bought when it it 15 after the election because I thought the rally was not based in reality. I then kept averaging down. I’m now 

100k in uvxy shares at 11.50 average
 
25k in uvxy 15c 3/19 at 2.05 average 

20k in sqqq 17c 3/19 1.68 average 

So down a bit. But I’ve had some success selling on huge volatility spikes and buying back after it comes back down

Not only is this great gains, it wasn't even particularly retarded. No margin or risky shit involved
not sure if it’s still applicable with the rules affecting GME but shares bought on margin can be lent out to shorts, thus weakening the short squeeze

Also don’t have to stress about theta / being theta neutral
Knowing there’s a retard somewhere on a yatcht, sippin on some expensive wine with super models, getting paid 1 dollar for every time a fleshlight is sold Is the kind of shit that keeps me up at night.

Are you familiar with “good to close” orders? They keep your order open for 60 days.

So what I would do is set a sell limit order at $100 (or whatever number you’re happy with), and select “good to close” (GTC). That means your limit order will be set and valid for the next sixty days. You don’t need to stay alert and set an order every day or set an order when it’s near your price. Set and forget. 

If you later decide 100 is too low you can cancel and set a new order. I’ve been playing GME in my retirement account and did this exact thing —bought at 20, set a sell for 25, walked away, saw that it was pushing up, cancelled and set for 31 and then just walked away. (Works the other way too obvs, if you bought at 30 and want to gtfo at 25 you can set the limit there.) that’s why market order is so dangerous—you have no control over your entry or exit which makes it hard to mitigate risk.

Haha it my content cuz I said (something similar to) poopy Koinn
Thin line tho.
It used to be T+3, but they relaxed it to T+2, so it takes exactly 2 days for cash to settle.  There wasn’t much noise about it, although it made a considerable difference in my trading style.  I don’t mess with margin.

I can't suggest anything, but I'll be trading along the way at arbitrary points. The biggest winning strategy won't be known until after it's all said and done, so I wouldn't stress about when or how to sell, just be happy that it happened at all and make dank tendies

With Ryan cohen and expansion opportuinty, GME is still a Long play, but the squeeze is just the stars aligning.
GME is an excelleret valmue bye, as it was prior to the current correction Trading far Bella a fair Price evalutaion of 40-50$
Then it was what, 5%? Likely higher now. Not sure what difference it will make if we are 8 or 12%, we're still going intergalactic
calls are hedged with shares, not immediately though i think it takes two days for leaps. thats why the squeeze with gme didnt occur until wednesday

however if you insist on BB so bad go for it after you get the free tendies from GME

You might be right about standard QE. I need to go back and read about what that really entails. 

However we still have hundreds of billions to trillions of dollars still getting injected into the economy and in circulation. Stimulus checks, zombie company bailouts, companies affected by covid, small businesses, etc. whether or not this is enough to cause runaway inflation is up for debate

That's true, but there are tools for dealing with this, we call roll out our position or we can roll down our position. If you understand options then the risk is manageable.

I imagine he probably had a lot of time to figure out how to handle it after it started being 1000% return.... then 10,000% return... then 100,000% return... and now at twice that.

No way anyone sitting on that amount of money wouldn't figure out EXACTLY what the fuck they're doing with it after. OP could very well be smart, but even a retard can read big numbers and realize they need to figure out what the hell they should do.

100% I just saw on the news that Buyden plans to announce a green energy infrastructure plan in early Feb. This alone might save my Feb calls, let alone other catalysts that are coming up sooner
i might just be an autist, but doesn’t that mean if a stock goes down 10% in a day that chances are in a majority of circumstances it’s a good buy because there’s significantly less risk, while also being high reward?
puts werent even that great today, iv getting crushed. I always avoid tsla on the way down because of that. Much easier to jump on it as it goes on its usual week or two long green days with iv pumping.
So should I buy rn at $35.50?
Hi mate, I am from New Zealand too. I use interactive broker, easy for options. (But time is shit for me,  am sleeping most of the time during trading hours.)

I've got news for you autists: the shit you pulled on GME was likely illegal too. The company's fundamentals haven't changed one whit. You colluded to manipulate a stock and make money based on predicting each others' behavior. You'll likely get away with it, this time, because you're ultimately small fries. But you have definitely attracted the SEC's attention. And I wouldn't be the least bit surprised if one or two of you get a knock on the door.
Wait, wallstreet*bets*? Did this sub change names or have I erroneously been reading it as WallstreetBrats for years?
Extra money into GME on any dip. There are no other plays right now.
Also true. Insider trading would be insiders DMing known non-SEC members insider information then conspiring to manipulate the market which is even more illegal than just conspiring to pump and dump.

The most retarded thing is this is a public forum searchable by google's webcrawlers. Conspiring to manipulate the market here is dumber than taking a selfie during the siege of the capital building.

Thank you for your service.
What’s your PT
no no. options is not day trading. 

you buy a contract that says for example: until April you are allowed to buy 100 GME stocks for 20USD. you can hold on to this and wait for the price to rise as much as possible before april. you are holding on to the contract, not the shares.

if you decide to sell when they are at 40 USD, you will get 20 USD (minus the premium) per share.

if you hold until it almost expires in april and they are at 100 USD. you will get 80 (minus the same old premium) per share

How many shares do you have? I’m also from NZ. I’m using stake. What platform are you using? Have you bought options before, how?
You wish!
Great advice. Do you happen to have any prediction for high how the price per share could go?
💎🤲 694.20 No fucking dip. Shorts getting margin called. This is not VW just like 2020 recovery was not 08’. I like TA witchcraft myself, but falling to $22 will not happen.
Great write up, I think going forward this will be helpful to my journey trying to learn options. Have you ever considered doing YouTube videos explaining this? I ask because I think a visual walk through (at least for me) is easier to comprehend vs reading.

Honestly sometime it's alright being late to the party, none of us are able to tell if it is green or red for GME on Tuesday but we can all sure as hell tell you it will 🚀 🚀 🚀 by end of this month with the short squeeze.  Patience is one of the things we all need to learn in life and trading.

Imagine the TV show that comes out later this year called "How I went bankrupt in 2020/21"

It'll feature everyone who bought TSLA puts.

Robinhood.
Nah, it will not stop at 37, but lots of people say around 420, or even 649. So I really do not know. What is your prognosis?
wai what can you confirm daddy elon has BB all up in spacex?
OP wasn't talking about the general DD and enthusiasm posts. He's talking about people literally posting into public record schemes for insider trading and the manipulation of vulnerable tickers.

So we know that Melvin sold the stock short and eventually needs to cover their position. I bought into 🚀🚀🚀because l'm an 👨‍🚀Do we know how much interest a short of this size costs them? Surely Melvin can hope to ride this fora year at least before closing their position and just hope that wSB moves into a bigger rocket. 🚀If they fear losses, can Melvin buy shares to ride it up theoretically cap their losses at this price point until it comes back to earth, and then when they decide to flood the market with sells they bring it back down to earth through manipulation. If they are paying 1% interest, and feel the stock is actually overvalued, then shouldnt a drop below this price next year even for example 2% below today's price be worth it? They are only out of the money once they close the position. So they could theoretically diamond hand their short, wait till this loses momentum and reverses. Tldr: Can someone who knows more about short positions do a DD on how long they can hold out?

In other comment OP said he exercised and is going to sell resulting stock gradually to lower tax burden
Who is Melvin??
see my other thread for context. I’m verifying my email and shit rn so I can relog into app smh
This is actually helpful thank you! 

I should have phrases it better I meant a podcast or something that explains these fundimentals. More than willing to troll the internet for days weeks or months educating myself but I thought a community of 1.9m people might have some recommendations or maybe even a shameless plug haha.
What happens if you let these expire?
I forgot to ask, what app are you using which get verified so quickly? Maybe it works here as well

They'll only get more expensive as the Augusta jump on shit in a week's time. Load up the barrel with calls while you can. We're headed to space fam. Noone is selling. Noone.
Ahhhhh yeeezy yeeezy how you doin huh?!
This question has been asked so many times lately. As long as they have acces to other exchanges, yes they can. The Stock is all the Same, it does Not matter where you buy it
[removed]
What are ue other current holdings? What further stuff r u recommending?
DFV has april/june calls. Some autists here are recommending highest price for april/june as well if/when the squeeze happens. IV is high, so that’s your risk. Shares are the surer way, but calls can bring you the money too if it goes to the moon.
Yeah, inflation is about the amount of cash in the economy for folk to pay for stuff that economy produces. QE money is held back from circulation and can actually only be "spent" on a few things. Usually things that also help control inflation. Bonds with varied end times mostly. Long bonds are good because it kicks the problem down the road to a time when population is also higher. Very few people or organizations can hold back their purchasing or production for appreciable percentages of a persons life-span.

seems right 3,443,600/221,084.54 = 15.5759.../50 (shares he bought) = 0.31 - the price on the right he paid for them
I hopped in too early and have admittedly lost a fair bit of money this week but there's plenty of time to recover and I'm confident they will pay off in the long run.

Buying leaps tuesday open is probably not a bad move. Thinking of getting more myself.

Lmao you still holding. I’m thinking of just going all in now and waiting till the eventual market collapse
Well, define too late. Do you think GME will stop at 37$? Or do you think its gonna surpass 100$ in the next week or two? Even you get in at 50$ there might be a chance of you doubling (or more) your money. So tell everyone you know to buy shares

'Insider trading' implies that there is inside information.

What we are doing here is called a consortium, where many people trade together due to open, publicly available information out of their own free will.
Idk like I know the SEC has been strong in the past but over the past year they’ve seemed quite toothless despite I’d say a few moments of sus stuff happening

Would gme leaps be a smart play ontop of shares?
You could buy me a Tesla model 3...
Do it! Seriously short squeezes explode the prize, I convinced a family member to put in 40k at 38$ and I would have done the same 60$ or even 70$. This things is going to 400 if the short squeeze happens, what seems expensive now seems cheap in the future. I remember buying my first stocks at 18.7 and thinking it was so expensive and that I was in it way late.... now I think 18.7 is a frickin steal. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

If you're in Europe, feel free to shit on anyone on Google reviews and the such, that's what they're for.
Naw pray for me bro, I’m still in 😅
Looked at it for the first time, their google reviews are absolute shit. Lol

" Horrendous company with no customer support. Look at their BBB rating. Atrocious. Tried contacting numerous times over a cancelled transaction that the seller still sent well after the cancellation. They give sellers too much latitude to ship. After 8 days I cancelled due to no evidence the seller would follow through and I was going on vacation. Seller shipped 3 days after cancellation anyway, and i then was responsible for a package that shouldn’t have been shipped. At some point after 4 emails they sent an automated email asking for more info but guess what.. it was from a NOREPLY email. Are you kidding me? Reported to BBB."

I don't see it going up.

How much profit will you bank
Retards togeter stronk
This could be life-changing. I won’t try to time my exit at the top, as it may come and go in nanoseconds. I will probably take off work a couple days when it starts. When it’s time to consider selling, I’ll have an initial sell order of maybe 25% just to recover my initial stake and some profit. I am thinking about worst case scenarios and how to mitigate them, such as loss of internet access. I don’t have my broker’s number; gotta get that in case I have to call. I don’t want to blow my nut too early. I’m willing to keep a stake in GME forever, since it’s guaranteeing my retirement, so I won’t sell it all.

There’s lots more to think about. Glad I have a long weekend to think about it. Selling some at 420.69 and 694.20 will make screenshots suitable for framing.
Sir, this is a casino.
Yeah another user responded with the Revolut app, and said he got approved within an hour. So I will look into that.

I hope it gets verified soon, since then i can get in at around 35 instead of the 60-80 haha
And while I'm thinking about it, I also need to give a shout out to /u/dawla_fat_farm for cluing me into not only ARRY (and its subsequent buyout), but I think his DD was also the target that I aspired to achieve.

If autist OP sees this; you SELL covered calls. The calls are COVERED by your own shares. Selling covered calls is usually a short term bearish position.

Alright, that is an interesting read, thank you.

So with the GME its all about the stocks/shares, truly buying low and selling it as ''quickly'' and highly as possible before the prices go back down again?

I doubt this is a thing of the long haul right? Holding on to them for months.
Preach. It’s only a matter of time before a good thing gets shut down☝️
There’s always a sell off on Friday, and a major sell off heading into a long weekend.

They aren’t going to waste or risk losing capital on legal fees when they can simply request that the google reviews are removed on the basis that they are fake or violate google policy.

Doing TA on a highly event driven stock and declaring your evaluation has any meaning?
Isn't that like evaluating a fairly new cars value after a crash and saying: "I don't believe it has lost a lot of value, it is not that old and the parts should be used too much". Yeah, sure, but there WAS A CRASH! That changes your regular analysis.

I'm sorry brother, but it's going through the roof on tuesday and if they announce margin calls for wednesday it doesn't stop. The only chance you have to buy back in, is tuesday morning at $50, or wednesday at $50 if 201 expires and margin calls don' go through. Good luck sorry for missing the bag brother.
Both good you fool

because you can't trade CNRG options on robinhood and I want fast money not slow money
We need a way to accurately track the market cap of WSB. 

Just imagine that market cap going up $1B next week.
Agree with OP. Follow this sub moslty for the A+ memes, but every once in a while some top notch DD shows up. I read it, follow it up with my own DD, and if convinced, make tendies (or so he says).

Anyway, we don't need a million and one posts shouting that gme or bb are going up. I have fucking eyes and altough I am illiterate, I'm not colorblind. 

And we definitely don't want to be shut down cuz some idiots are literally trying to do illegal shit while also signaling to the whole world they're doing illegal shit (we saw how well that went for those people in DC). Fuck me, if this continues I might have to go back to *gasp* r/investing and listen to the old people talk about etfs or some shit that make me a whopping 1% per year.
I see u/zjz interventions and comments all the time. This mod work like crazy for this sub.

I think some normies just need a little push to understand this...aggressive/insulting meme culture (which may push away many other normies, self-controlling?). But exposure calls for more control, now the WSB is out in the media a lot of people from many agendas will ingress...and this require a very sensitive democratic touch of things.
I know that feel
and foreign countries don‘t have climate goals? lmao every industrial country in europe and asia also has goals for carbon-emission-reduction and sustainable energy 😂
I’m with Consorsbank. With the young trader zero account you can trade at the marketplace tradegate completely for free without any fees. And there are no other fees except if you buy at a different marketplace or options then it’s 9,95€. Pretty nice so far and the app is also clean and good✌🏻

F
Were you fools up all night? Reading this at 0430 CST and I thought only myself and the US Marines are up this early.
well look at it this way. we are at 35$ atm, but going to 100$ already sounds insane. Looking at the market cap tho: we are at 35$ at 2,5b and 100$ would still only be ~7b. Now imagine we got to an acceptable market cap of 30b which would literally give us 420$. Now it doesnt look as crazy anymore tbh
Green stocks have been down for like what...five days? Yeah the ICLN losses blow but shit y'all are being dramatic af

Green energy is undeniably the future and will continue to be pushed by the Biden administration and governments around the world. If you're bearish about calls at least buy shares. It's not like climate change is just gonna magically disappear.
No. Theoretically the person buying the options from you can exercise those options to buy the shares at a discount, that's why the options are worth so much.

But in practice, there are "market makers" in the market that fill these orders. Just google that term to learn more.
We already witnessed the best case for equities.. remember the covid crash a year ago and where we are now, record highs. look at historical charts of what inflation does to the stock market... 1970s to 1980s... Volcker had to whip his 12 inch dick out to stop it with super high interest rates. On top of that US was the economic OG back then too.. today china's economy is overtaking the US. so we can loose the dollar status.. bad bad shit be comin.
This is like populism for stocks

Genuine question here: who gets in legal trouble, and how is it even enforceable?

Like, if someone posts what they're buying and adds a bunch of rockets, is that illegal? What about if 100 commenters jump in saying "I bought 1000 shares this morning!". Is thay illegal, and who gets In trouble? Tje commenters? OP? Everyone who saw the thread and bought shares?

Was today the highest gain he could have scored ?

Or similar price , a further away from expiry would give better results ?
Your broker should be able to fund that for you, for a fee of course. Alternatively, you can just get a loan from elsewhere.
I was in knowing nothing but GME 🚀🚀🚀  then I heard buying GME fucks over Melvin Capitol so I though who the fuck is Melvin Capitol anyway I bought as much GME as I could.
This is not confirmation bias I am seeking :(
ICLN is the most diverse basket of hot clean biz. It gets global attention too. Just ride of the back of that global audience buying in. It's going to blow up when JB us officially inaugurated.
As I've been saying in all of my comments, we are not trading on TA anymore, there is no TA for this, we are entirely news dependent, and no news means price goes up until further notice. So if GME doesn't offer shares by tuesday, prices go up.

the ill informed spamming of tickers is annoying and not healthy i’ll agree, but the part i don’t agree with is the sort of inference that we should just succumb to institutional investors and let them control the market with their billions of dollars etc. yes they have more money as one body than probably any of us will ever have, but nonetheless a retail “uprising” isn’t all that bad. what do i know though. a good, necessary post nonetheless so it’s an upvote from me but what do i know.

Every CEO obviously has in his objectives to bring the stock price up.
While I am very bullish on BB and will reinforce my position next week, this post is fucking useless. Bring quality content to the table.
GME, doubt you’ll get in that low though. 
Also, NYSE is shut on Mon for MLK.
I see where you’re coming from but I disagree. If you look at GMEs share volume for example last trading day was 45 MM shares (well above its 3 month average of 13MM). If even 10% of this sub buys 100 shares, half of the bought shares for the entire trading day would be owned by this sub. That doesn’t even include the ripple effect that hits twitter/discord/personal networks, etc. That definitely does hold some real weight. This is the new age of investing where mass connection through technology can make an impact on stocks.

TLDR; apes together STRONk.
Yeah, 420.69 is good for the memes but I would rather bleed Melvin Capital dry so 694.20 is the way (at the very least)
There's an expression I use often when teaching people about stocks, buy slow sell slow. You can sell a small amount of your position on the way up for profit taking, but don't sell in big chunks, don't sell half of your position at a set price. start at a lower price than that, and slowly unload that position, because that will give you the maximum possibility to capture the top. You can also sell after the peak and you'll still capture 2/3s roughly of the peak, so you don't have to think too hard about it that way.
If only Elon would just tweet:

Only buying shares as I am not worthy of the gains!

Wow you truly are retarded. Market is closed Monday.
Zimbabwe wasn't the world reserve currency now was it? All that printing will lead to some bad bad shit... day by day. might aswell print it for affordable housing instead of supporting zombie companies where management just cashes out and builds cocaine snowmen. 

  The way US has been managed in the last 20+ years is downright embarrassing. I'm moving to Kenya.
I'd been watching Plug and BE for a while, I went with BE calls instead of plug at $35 😔

I'll still get good return from BE for sure, but that spike from plug was a real kick in the dick.

My Tesla Tequila finally arrived today
>First stage is denial and ridicule.

Sort of like the ridicule from institutions about Tesla, mocking Elon's personality.
I saw a post where some one legit said we should all go and buy a small market cap business to pump up the price. That seemed to me to be going a little farther than giving advice on one that you think might do well.
Puts on r/stocks for months.
Someone said an analogy once that struck well with me.

You know how in a lot of households, the house is meant for everyone but the wife has control of the design, furniture and layout? And then the man has his man cave where he can do what he likes? That’s r/politics vs r/conservative

Thanks for the answer. I got 20% spread on sell orders so I guess that I just gotta be present during the squeeze. FML for having finals next week.
Without being a boring bastard, what tickers have this sort of potential without being a penny stock??

Ill also take longer timeframes? Obvs except gme lmao

I cant imagine investing 1.5k into something that would blow up to millions in a few months/years
[deleted]
Hold
Think you gotta fact check that last one. It's the biggest risk with the lowest return. Don't forget shorting TSLA. Buyers are queuing up to pick up TSLA for the 1000$ run. We're on a fucking mission.
Buying calls on uvxy
Either 3 or 3000
The premium on calls atm just seems a bit crazy. I took my profit at $32 and don't regret. If it holds or dips slightly throughout next week without any big spikes I'll get in again when the premiums reduce.

May sound gay bearish, but knowing when to take a win keeps you in the green

$GME
Hey there buddy.  Idk how you eurotards work but we here have good ole Robinhood to instantly approve us and do whatever the fuck we want, so maybe you have access to something like that?  Doesn’t hurt us to open with multiple brokerages too.


I would definitely get into GME ASAP, you should be fine to enter up through....$60-80 to be safe, butONLY if you’re able to watch the price action throughout the day.   The peaks should last at LEAST a few hours,  but you don’t want to buy $100 and then be sleeping when it crashes back to $40
So the only thing that matters is that it 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀
Fuck em. We’re really out here tryin to be Robin Hood with Robinhood.
I don’t give a shit if you mean almost always or always. You clearly don’t even understand what happens when a stock tanks 70% and you’re holding calls all the way. To say that’s almost always or always is comical 


Not married by the way not everyone here is 40
Obviously $420.69 is a good meme.  
$694.20 I think is still easily achievable, so the lower meme PT would be wasteful.  


Personally I'm hoping to see $1000 or more. This is probably wishful thinking, I'll exit before then if it obviously won't hit it.  
I'll probably sell half at $694.20 and depending on the trend sell a quarter higher than that, and then the last quarter on the way back down somewhere...  
This is just me. Opinions pls?

Nobody tell him the secret how to YOLO on options and get mega-rich! 🤣
Had a vivid dream I woke up and uvxy was at 50. I thought I was looking at the wrong stock or something. I look at my account, and it now has 7 digits in it. Out of sheer shock I drop my phone and it cracks. I run butt ass naked to my computer and quickly put in limit sell orders for all my options and shares. I then jack off furiously as it climbs even higher. To top off the wet dream I buy apple at 100, Microsoft at 180, and even Tesla at 400.

I got greedy, and hate having to stew on it over a long weekend
Yeah, because that's the only way that these hedge funds survive, and GME board knows that so they'll make an offering when the price is to their liking.
SEC if your listening suck a dick bitches you can’t get us Fucking all.

That being said these Fucking dogs could go an actually chase down people who are doing white collar crimes but we better shut down the retail traders first because otherwise we won’t have peasants to make us food and drive us around and clean our shit.
Boys I have 400 to yolo, what’s the play?
Like the chinese bot
Please help me. Im from Norway and don’t have these option trades available. Do you actually have to buy the shares when the contracts expires to then sell them for that 3,5 mill in cash?

I mean, that would still require a considerable amount of cash.
This guy knows what's up. I played Nokia from March with  leaps and shares. That shit nearly hit my 5 calls on June or July then fucking tanked from there and still hasn't recovered. THE LEAPS LOOK CHEAP FOR A REASON. Huge float, like the size of your mom's wardrobe float. Gets shorted to shit almost all the time. 

That being said they have been trying to reorganize and strategicly place themselves as THE 5/6G bet if you don't want ties to the CCP. Which is enticing and could "Eventually" pay off. But they are at the very beginning of their rebuild as of the 2021 and the CEO has outlined their 4 main divisions. 2023 leaps are the play. If I was smarter and not nee to the market in March I would have gotten in Qualcomm and TSM as they make the chips for a bunch of Nokia stuff but I bought nok at 2.83 so I'm not super mad. I was just new and didn't realize I should be looking at their supply chain. I got fucking evicerated on 1/15 options that I didn't cash out in June when it hit nearly 5.16. $5.17 was my break even for my contracts and I wanted to use my 7/10calls to pay for exercising my 5's. 
There went about a third of my account as of yesterday. Shits fucking risky and moves like molasses. Get used to looking at a typewriter on the charts.

YMMV

But bought in PLTR,CRSR and we fly
You actually are. If the price drops below a certain point, a stock can get delisted. By pumping up the price to a certain level we make sure that the stock remains healthy so Gamestop can acquire favorable loan terms and make investments to ensure a turn around. We are saving millions of jobs and should be proud of it!

If this so called bubble pops what are y’all shorting?

Safe bet: spy, other market ETFs

Slightly more risk more return: QQQ and other tech 

Even riskier: volatility plays 

Even RISKIER: options on 3x leveraged ETFs

MOST RISK MOST RETURN: shorting currently parabolic stocks (GME, BB, Tesla, PLUG, etc )
Like, that's the fucking (maybe literally) million dollar question. 

Doing some real fuzzy math (as in a wild fucking guess) comparing the amount of short interest on GME to VW in 2008, I feel like $300 is easy, so of course you don't want to be the guy selling too early and screwing everyone. 

I have sell limits set up in amounts accounting for 5-10% of my total position spread out from $420 to $3000. My thought is if I'm early to sell, minimizing how much I sell will help the pump keep pumping.

And of course I'll be looking to cancel these and adjust on the fly when the top goes.
25-30% a week is an amazing growth rate! Buying in at 32 for GME was definitively a smart decision, shorts havent even started covering yet, from what we know, they loaded up even more on wednesday and thursday, so almost garaunteed to moon sometimes next week. Good luck trading!
TA's predictive power is 0 here, it's a waste of time. This play is exciting *because* it pisses all over normal market forces.
That’s not very 💎 🙌 though
degiro has a good article on options:

https://www.degiro.ie/what-are-options

stocks you are investing directly on the asset. so if the company gains 30%. you got 30% profit.

options you speculate on the price. you buy a contract that might say you are allowed to buy 100 stocks at 20 USD. if the price goes to 30 USD, you will still only pay 20 for each share (making 1000 minus the fee, or premium, in profits). the big numbers here are all from options, not stocks. if the price goes down, let's say to 15, of course, you won't pay over than the market price to buy these stocks, so you lose the money you put on buying these contracts.

can someone help by writing down the calculations for Tsla PE ratio ?   
thanks in advance 🙏
Wouldn't you be taxed at the long-term capital gains rate because you held these LEAP options for over a year?

>The seller of the LEAP is taxed at the long-term capital gain rate if they held the contract for at least a year and a day. If they held the contract for a shorter period, they would be subject to short-term capital gains rates.

a literal god amongst retards

congrats
I'm a retard, same as you. But this is what I understand to be happening.

Is 40$ a good price to buy in? Yes but not because "40$ is good", but because of when.

An event hasn't occurred yet. 

Obviously not as good as 4$ entry like some. But still, doesn't matter. Things haven't played out yet, so, up it continues.

Until shorts buy all the stock and then some (this is the position they took!), it won't matter what the price is. The purchase of an amount of stock greater than how many exist is guaranteed. And they haven't paid yet.

And few enough shares exist for retailers to have substantial effect. (unlike with say, BB)

Fundamentals and Gamestop's future plans - actually all irrelevant in this context. Although good news for GME is what I believe incidentally started all this. 

Burry, Cohen, DFV, undervalued fundamentals, overzealous shorts. There's no one grand actor here. It just sort of all converged. 

Anyway

There are big players that put themselves in position where they are obligated to buy a lot of GME - at any price. Their bet was that GME would go down to 0.

Kinda like a retard here on wsb selling a naked call and being on the hook for whatever happens. Whatever the price of the stock is beyond the breakeven, expect to pay, no matter how ridiculous it went up. Infinite loss potential.

Now that shorts are in trouble, they will try things to make people sell their shares. 

I've learned a couple these last few days; buying premarket and selling during market so people's eyes only see decline; make distracting posts about other "opportunities", which encourages selling to get in on something else (like BB squeeze which has 10x requirements of GME 🙄).

Now, once all this hababalooh blows over and the price spiked ridiculously in the context of GME's entire history ([look at VW](https://moxreports.com/vw-infinity-squeeze/)), then a more useful discussion of Gamestop's plans and fundamentals can be had. But for now, despite all the noise, things are actually really really simple.

Supply and "demand".

There's more demand than supply, and demand is running out of time. 🚀
At least I can watch Bannedcoin all weekend and pretend my MARA calls are moving with it
I see it as more of an issue of the lockdowns. In reality, the government is 100% responsible for the economic damage, as they instituted lockdowns. Imagine owning a buisness such as a hotel, then the government shuts down your buisiness due to covid, then gives you no aid. There would be riots in the streets. They're trying to apply this concept to everybody in the form of extra unemployment and stimulus.

I believe theyre trying to cover their own ass and maintain an image of legitimacy. Trust me, once all this aid shit goes away, a lot of these companies will simply implode if they can't improve their balance sheets.

Wouldn’t the market maker have to pay OP $3.4M for the options and then another $670K to exercise them, giving them a cost basis of $4.07M. 

Then they would need to sell each share above for $814 (4.07M/5000), netting $5000 for each dollar TSLA is above that price?

“Why would the effects of unlimited QE show up now when they didn’t for 12+ years”?

Well we were printing, but only at the rates to additionally stimulate a pretty good economy. Think normal person that takes recreational coke from time to time. 

In 2019, our economy started to slow down. Out of worry, we increased QE late 2019 to offset this. Our addict is now taking coke not just for fun at parties but every night. 

Then covid hit. Ripples thru our economy. In our analogy this is like our addict having a close friend pass away. He is now using coke five times a day to cope. 

Our government is basically using QE as the end all be all solution to every problem. Trump was using it to help him get re-elected. Biden is promising even more to pave is entry into presidency. 

But we all know a full blown addict on coke taking 100 lines a day can’t last forever. Either he’ll overdose and die trying get the same high (stock market highs) or try and detox (deflationary policies to repair our dollar)
No idea. But yes.
I’m planning on going all in on GME shares. I want to read the original DD but I can’t find it. Help a fellow autist out?

Investopedia disagrees.

>When LEAPs are sold at a profit, the gain is taxable. The seller of the LEAP is taxed at the long-term capital gain rate if they held the contract for at least a year and a day. If they held the contract for a shorter period, they would be subject to short-term capital gains rates.

Absolutely and that's what made me nervous over the past few weeks. I don't want to lose my gains so I am banking in some gains already. I'm not going to seel all of it but in my case I guess it's time to liquidate some shares (just in case).

You on 212 yea? Have you done this on your ISA or through invest account? In invest account I beleive 212 has the right to lend out your shares. On an ISA I don't beleive this is the case!

I had one week call on Tesla expired,  3GS like that and then some other calls went down  with today’s sell off
IV in leaps isn't so insane. My November leaps are only like 115%. Which is high, but not this 300%-400% were seeing in the weeklies. Could be a good option to wait out the squeeze with...

I'm hoping for some more pullback to get into some good names. I thought plug was high at 28 hell I thought it was worthless and another pump and dump at 2.58 when it announced what I thought was just pointless bullshit about clean energy battery blah blah with some big fucking company Amazon or some shit and then fucking bam 70 a share lmao. Ya kno what I mean?
Short squeeze inbound. The rocket hasn’t left
yeah but think, there’s people throwing 30 fucking grand like nothing into it assuming they’re real screenshots, the amount of guidance and influence this sub has is scary, honestly could see the SEC doing some cracking down or some BS cuz of it
how is shorting more shares than exists even legal? shit like this is what caused 2008

Crazy eyes
How good is technical analysis, which is weak by itself, when there is a fucking short squeeze incoming?

If this thing drops to the 20s I'll take everything I have in my bank account and bet it on a squeeze.
congrats, but why the fuck are you using robinhood on a mobile browser than the app??
You can’t post about any company less than a billion because if it becomes a meme stock WSB would make it soar because of its low market cap. This is a newer rule bc its happened before and can be considered market manipulation.
Hey I'm with you, I got shares but also trying to make some gains on weeklies, also got $55c 1/22, currently down after that Friday drop but next week!

Sold all my stocks that weren’t dipping yesterday for money for retarded calls.

Sell when it’s high not low, right?

Not if you do it wit a VPN
That was a lot for me , got over confident
I mean I have 100 shares in. I’m just a guy.  We for sure have moving power here now. Its starting to show
I’m pretty much identical. 611 shares at 10.59
Big Black what?
That and "I'm still standing".. stupid shorters
Dont quit ur day job u dumbass
Had a nightmare about me somehow getting margin called over and over again and losing $100 a second until it got down to 0
I did the math, that’s 0.09 cents to control a share, giving about 44.5:1 leverage
Ueah
When my options get down to single digits pennies, I always triple down.

Cost almost nothing and one day it'll swing the right way and I'll look like a genius.
No just retarded. An offering now would be a major lifeline for shorts right now allowing to avoid uptick rules for a while and drill the price down bigly
what do you guys think about BB ?
GME ain’t mooning for no reason, this sub has grown to a point where shit can actually be manipulated, i’ve been here since 300k and we’re almost at 2 million, that’s a lot of fucking power guy
I hate weekends
Made calls at wrong time and premium decayed tf out. Also got greedy when calls made little profit.
you would be checking the stock price. so if it i.e. reaches 420,00 sell 

Its hard to say how hard it will spike tho to be honest.
What about the voting power of the additional 1,865,748 degenerates on this sub?
Are you going to roll it over and stonk it all on YOLO GME?
Yes as it could 50+ next week, and triple figures medium term
So BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 ???
To be fair WSB members are probably their target audience.
Yeah, my plan was to invest for €1500, so if the price was 35 (like now) then i would be making big bucks (for me anyway) if I was selling at 420
Look at you bragging about your job at Wendy’s. Some of us are unemployed and using our last savings to fuck Melvin.
Yes because all charts behave the same
We should probaly switch to English for the other retards.

Well, the Flatex website is pretty crappy at some times. They also raised the fees this year and from now on you pay 0.1% on your depot values p.a. - it's not much but still.

Overall I guess the broker is alright but I am not sure if I like the fact that taxes are dealt with immediatelly :D
Congrats
Wsb is not a place where pump and dumps get organized. People trade something because they have a real reason, not just to pump something. That's the same with hedge funds.
There is a difference between buying some calls or shares because you believe there will be some good earnings or a reason, and just buying to pump a stock. 
If the only reason is pumping a stock that is illegal, if you are doing it believing in some event that is legal. But I'm just an autist so don't take this as legal advice
PT of 16 equals a market cap less than their Q4 2020 sales, which given the new console cycle, refreshed BoD, financial solvency, and turnaround plan is ridiculous. 

While there’s no way GME will settle ultimately at $100, I could see this easily in the 30-40$ range.

How do you know chasing the high flyers was a mistake? You have the sentiment of a paper handed  🌈 🐻. You can’t buy into a high flyer and not expect volatility. There will always be ups and downs. The higher the ups the larger the downs will be. As long as the ups are highest the rocket 🚀 will soar. Hold until your losses become profits. This is the way. Don’t call yourself 💎🙌... you definitely have toilet paper hands. I know you sold your positions.
keep upvoting i have calls expiring on this comment 🚀🚀🚀
This is the way! + BFG

I understand your point, but I don’t understand how the same point can’t be applied to zombie companies. Brrrrr Money flows in, to pay for employees and line the higher up and stockholder pockets, but at the end of the day you’re not getting that money back. 

“Free” money is still being injected at unprecedented rates. 

All I’m saying is if we’re gonna print to infinity for companies might as well print a little more and give homeless people a place to live and some food on their plate.

Reading is for losers, winners guess
What would I be checking for every few hours? 1) If it reaches a rate I want to sell at (e.g. 4.20) so I can sell, 2) in case it starts to drop to get out quickly? Anything else?

You can legally trigger a short squeeze if you have enough capital can't you?

That's not price manipulation, that's being a bad ass bull.
I already YOLOd all my money into Robinhood and quit my job, there’s no more money to double down with
That was on tuesday, and nobody noticed because the day traded flat.

How do you look back into 2018 on ToS? I can only look back a couple months.
Holy fuck shits
They simply should just buy gme and dont waste energy on a printer.
double down
For at least a month too
If the government gave people money to do nothing, the whole financial system would collapse. Why should i work 60 hrs a week when the government can pay me a weeks wage for doing nothing?

 But this mindset would rather instead lead to the dollar beung devalued as its basically being conjured  out of thin air.

But if people stop working because free money, shit isnt getting done. And Why should i not raise my prices if i know daddy govvy will print out trillions and hand it out? The big corporation bailouts are financial engineering because the system currently benifits those at the top (politicians, the rich, etc.).

In reality, capitalism in a way is just coercion by someone with more resources than you into working for a wage that is just enough to keep you coming back, but low enough to maximize profits. Still, definatly better than tribalistic anarchy.
today was a dip
Das ist Flatex - nicht gerade der beste. Empfehlungen werden gerne angenommen.
As soon as you can (Tuesday) cause the 🚀 can launch anytime. They'll try to push down the price 10-20% next week but hold anyway cause it's not worth the risk waiting for a dip and missing the launch.

Also the longer they stall by buying more shorts the more tendies there will be for us anyway
Tata steel just announced their earnings , iron ore is at 9 year highs. Vale will print my calls, come back to this comment.
When you buy a call, your max loss is 100% of what it costs to enter the trade, ie premium + commissions
It's a lot easier to make money than to keep it.

Hopefully this retard is the exception, not the rule.

I had to sell some calls on a loss to yolo into them, and I think that's how I'll play from now on since it works. Sell everything on red, buy everything that's green. Rinse and repeat and I'll never be down a day in my life.
Exactly. The higher interest is a bonus for sure, BUT Cohen is actually doing some good work to turn it around and the board is listening. The squozening was almost assured as soon as Cohen stepped in.
🌳🌳🌳
Yeah man, its weird I spend time with family and friends but feel so alone
Really appreciate the detail you put into the information here. Definitely feeling like getting in on the action now.
Puts
I feel you but there's a difference between buying the top of BB and having it drop a point and buying at the top of a historical short squeeze and going broke so fast you are spontaneously teleported into the dumpster of the nearest Wendy's.

Like. We're all retarded bulls here but jesus christ I'm not gonna be the asshole telling him to YOLO at any price while the motherfucking top is blown off

Tldr: GME TO THE FUCKING EDGE OF THE UNIVERSE BOYS 🚀🚀🌌
Bruh ive owned 3 cars over since getting my L's 20 years ago, a 94 civic, 2002 accord, and ive had my rx400 for 10 years now and it has been the best car. I totalled my accord last year and got my wife the camry with the insurance check.
Let me also include, Long calls usually over 9+ or more, are called LEAPS, and what makes these better than standard should the stocks go south, is that you only lose what you invested, you can't go negative and potentially owe in the extreme cases.   


If you want to learn more about it, Youtube "Inthemoney" and "Leaps" into your search bar, this guy who runs this channel is really good at explaining the benefits of LEAPS in a laymans way.
We’ll see. I just checked my td messages and nothing new yet 🤞
Was ist das für ein Broker du autist
Look, I do believe in NOK (my whole portfolio was in NOK leaps at some point, cashed out near the top very early in fall), but just be careful not to underestimate just how SLOW this thing moves.  The float is massive.
Was inside information being shared on the sub???
I've seriously considered it but feel like my family and friends would put me in gamblers anonymous or some shit
The people freaking out about what they were gonna do if they had to take delivery on 20 tons of corn😂😂😂
I don’t even know what he did or what this all means but I’m super impressed.
Not to burst your bubble but you can't buy options with most major brokerage using margin dude. So the margin calls are gonna fuck the longs.
Alright,  we'll get another guy
This is fucking gold 😂😂😂😂
Throw 1k at shares if you arent sure about it. Watch the premarket activity on tuesday. If it stays near 35 then buy. If it pops up like I expect, wait for a dip.
I'm new here, so let me ask more experienced retards. OP bought some shit for 1.5k USD and is a multimillionaire today, correct?
34.5 (1/2 of 69)
i’d really like someone to put some sort of website together to see how much of GME wsb really owns, like no BS fake screenshots or lies, straight up how much we own, and if it’s a good chunk we should demand a seat at the inventors call
Does that really work? I've heard before that reading can help with sleep.

Does it usually dip on open compared to pre-market?
Probably was cheap because everyone's grandma on wall street was doing black magic ritual prayers for them to go bankrupt
They're horrible cars. Its like the opposite of a Toyota car. However they have some of the highest owner satisfaction ratings for a reason. Go on r/realtesla 

I'd say stick with the 3 if you want 'reliability', since it is older and much more popular.

I wouldn't buy unless i was in cali tho
it might crash further to like 15-20$ at worst case but at that price there would be big buying power so it wouldnt stay there for long, watch the news and Cohen's twitter, positive news could be a catalyst by now.
Thanks, appreciate you
They're so fucked, the brokers must know this with their moves to remove everyone off margin today, people are going to lose so much money, and when your caught short your loses are infinite.
Weekend news always releases the day before (usually Sunday)
Because you will always get the worst possible fill. Consider market order to be the equivalent of saying “I’ll buy (or sell) at whatever fucking price!”

The big bois will see that desperation and you’ll get filled at an absurd number. Trust me, it’s never worth it to put the price out of your control.
if GME short squeezes on monday are we all fucked??? i mean is it possible it can happen when the markets are closed?

You raise an interesting point, one I will consider greatly over the next few hours
GME Board members being let go had to sell some of their shares ([Wolf](https://www.streetinsider.com/Insider+Trades/GameStop+%28GME%29+Director+Wolf+Sells+Nearly+%2421+Million+in+Stock+Amid+Ongoing+Short+Squeeze/17827380.html)), also had some institutional selling to rebalance since the price has run up so much - those shares were then borrowed and shorted immediately to keep the price down so the melvin capitals could continue and try to cover at lower price.

Brokers have since reduced or eliminated margin, and the uptick rule is now in play on GME.

Let's see how many funds need to head towards the exits because of margin call over the long weekend come Tuesday.

As long as it's under 100 it's ok but you're good cause there will pretty surely be a drop on tuesday open so buy then

150 shares at $10.40 - diamond hands 🖐🏻💎
Why?
How is it 5 days to cover with 5million volume/day on 70mill shorts??
I also jumped to the same negative conclusion on another thread, and was duly corrected.

You might not be totally fucked. Monday's a market holiday so you kind of get that day for free. No one can actually be sure how long or how high the GME 🚀 will fly so get your shit set up as fast as possible and maybe you can still catch some tendies

Well I bought a little over 75k worth of FUBO $40 5/21 contracts. But whatever this wallstreetbets. I’m either a genius or a straight up fucking retard
Varta in germany has 50% sold short, with 50% borrow fee.
Europe is waiting for that short squeeze too, sadly it is not known that much
there is instant bank transfer for etoro. check your payment options. but be aware that paypal charges a hefty fee. use klarna instead.
thanks luv u
Nah, in WSB the moto is to buy high sell low
This, ladies and gentlemen, is what weaponized autism looks like. This is our bread and butter. Call me a fucking retail investor one more time you boomer fucks. They have no idea who we have among our ranks. We act retarded but we are really some smart motherfuckers. And even the retards do their part. Think about this the next time your paper hand having ass thinks about selling.
thanks bb
300 shares / 9$ I am doing my part!
This is amazing, DFV’s reaction 🤣🤣
This. Why don’t people listen to us? We may be retarded but we aren’t stupid. 😤Options are too sketchy with GME imo. But if you want to risk it, follow the momentum and right now it’s up. Likely will be for most of 2021
The positive sentiment for gme is bonkers and it's only Saturday. If market opened tomorrow I feel like you'd be lucky to get it at 45 by open
Congratulations, that's insane! Oh, and fuk you (:

Yeah someone who wins the lottery should only take advice on tax matters from other people who have won the lottery. Makes sense. Keep buying those lottery tickets though, wall street loves a gambling addict.
Thank you.

In your opinion, when is the shareprice too high to get in? 50? Or does it not really matter since the price will go up substantially and i'll make a profit anyway?
Yo another hunter. Whish barchart was not delayed but could not live without the filtering and notifications in unusual whales. Is a lifesaver in trading. Got gme notification on whale app at 22, got shares, sold for 34 :D

Sending an email asking to speed it up you mean?
Everytime someone makes money in the stock market someone looses, don't fucking forget that. This is no GTA paper printing money game. If someone abuses the rules the SEC is cleaning them out (unless they are in the US Senate, that's different) so if we start breaking the rules we will be scattered. 
There are some rules to the subreddit, if you don't like them go and pump penny stocks, but if you are here follow the god damn rules so we are here for the next steel gang, or gme gang or even Palantir
[deleted]
it means no one knows what the peak is and no one's gonna know until it's over bc we can't see the future so you find a price you're comfortable exiting at and you get out then and don't worry about what "could have been" if you waited longer and it kept going up. The main goal in a squeeze is to not be left holding all your shares AFTER the squeeze has run its course. Your secondary and less-important goal should be trying to time the top to maximize your profit. This is uncharted territory and its impossible to know when we've hit the peak until it's all in the past.
Would I need to set a stop loss/take profit (sorry if these aren't proper terms) to play it safe? The concept makes sense to me, but I am afraid to log in after sleeping in one day and realIzing I missed the action.
lol
you could call your bank and ask them to open a deposit and buy the shares. might be harder or easier depending on the bank
Do your own DD. I know, testing is hard for some of you, but you should try.
if by "ones" you mean other companies/plays.
And if he doesn’t exercise the option all he does is lose the money in purchasing those contracts? There’s no world where he can lose more than the cost of the contract itself at ~$1,500?

If they all fill I’m making 475K and I will 100% get a G tattoo for GME. Set all the remindmes you want and that is a promise.
duh bro
Dude I was in wsb character in a different sub, I saw someone comment “you son of a bitch, I’m in”, I literally called him an autist and got downvoted so fucking badly. r/aww ain’t wsb.

basically, yeah
You're not late just buy GME shares on tuesday and lurk here to learn the stuff until then
Take a look at 1/22 10c , open interest , 206k
damn boy, wtf relax
Damn, I thought that was instant like all other transactions. Good to know.

I know all about FOMO haha, but this was a once in a lifetime opportunity so I just HAD to take it.

Why is everyone saying shares instead of options
My $5.41 in GME from the free stock on RH can confirm!
I think it's bad advice anyway.

Probably sets off red flags.
It's absolutely locked between 24 and 26 because of the insane manipulation making sure as many puts and calls as possible expire worthless.
I would never put a market order before open, (monday is closed for the holiday btw) I've done it in the past for whatever reason and it always bit me in the ass. If I learned anything over the years it's that trading in the first 30 minutes is usually incorrect as you saw on friday. I also bought at open at 38 so I got a half decent price, but if I waited like I knew I should have done, I could have gotten a better price. I expect premarket to go absolutely nuts on tuesday. I could be wrong, but expect a gap up on tuesday open, so lowering your cost basis may not be possible at this point. Looking at it for what it is, it'll be your decision if you want to increase your position further, I can't give you financial advise. I'll probably be buying more DEPENDING on the price.
Indeed.
Ark holds tsla what the fuck are you on about
It likely means you are not approved to trade instruments outside of common stock. Call your broker if it is a tool you want available
probably doesn't need to be every ten minutes, but checking on the stock every hour/few hours would be good. 

with the sell order you could define a rate at which you would want to sell this stock. If the stock reaches this amount ( or Melvin is forced to buy out everything) your stock can be bought. 

Thats why lots of people spamming 420.00 or 694.20. 

thats share price they are hoping/memeing for. 

you could just do it manually if you have the time to sit and look over your shares a lot
Actually Markus Koch is right. It´ll be a firesale
TELL THEM TO BUY GMEEEEEEEE
Why haven’t we done it yet
I loaded up on shares my initial purchase was 2297.88337 shares @ $5.58. At the time I thought the same thing you just said because it has moved from $2.80 or so. I’ve since averaged up to 2810 shares @ $7.04. Needless to say you never know what could happen. 

This one is kinda a long term play unless we get a massive short squeeze. GameStop should be trading in the $40-50 range on fundamentals alone. If you get in now it will be very volatile but I think within the next few weeks you will be glad you did.
When should I drop 25k on ARKG shares!!!??? I'm thinking I should wait and see what happens next week
Yeah, that is exactly why I am being impulsive now, since it's a once in a lifetime thing (if you dont count the VW in 2008) and I will certainly read more about it.

Wanted to ram in shares 1500 worth and then make big stonks. That way i could have a better starting position.
5G deals
??             Wow
also be aware that funds transfer to your account might take some time too.

There is not much you can probably do in the meantime. Read about FOMO.
If shes nasty and cool, keep her on your team. Idk about anyone else but i specifically picked a chick that would give me control of all her money and wouldnt ask twice about it. Every chick is a tendie machine imo

[deleted]
So, full disclosure, I'm new. This was my first options trade ever actually. 

But I do know enough about the market to know that Friday is the day all the gay bears come out to play so I'm still optimistic. Even if I don't get back to the 100% gain I got today at market open, I still am feeling confident that a lot of losses will be recovered. 

As a wise Autist once told me: 💎 👐
So basically the moon launch day(s) that everyone is waiting for doesn't have a real estimate is what I'm gathering from all this, correct? 

Or is there some day or time frame that gme is expected to soar?

Completely missed the initial GME 🚀 would I be regarded or retarded for buying weeklies this Tuesday
I was concerned about the SEC threat earlier but it's such a mess here, and we don't know shit about who knows shit.

I think the biggest threat is outsider actors from institutions manipulating the sub and 'stealing' small investor money. As if hedge funds don't legally steal money anyway..

SEC, if you're listening, monitor the institutions for meme stock purchases. Especially if the purchase was before the stock got popular on here.
Quite a lot of volume for it.


Last | Net | Bid | Ask | Vol | IV | Delta | Gamma | Interest
----|---|---|---|---|--|-----|-----|--------
687.55 | -22.1 | 683.95 | 691.6 | 543 | 0.02 | 1 | 0 | 5313



Congrats fucker.
Oh man I was in another group where this bitch cooked and ate her mans cum and live streamed it
We will have to resort to 1 GME= 1 GME style memes :)
Guys stop buying weeklies, this is  a long play. BB is so undervalued right now but it's likely going to take an announcement or deal for it to moon, and we don't know when that is going to happen. The selloff today was likely just boomers cashing in on gains since they don't know what a beast this company is now. Every tech company is allowed to reinvent itself once.
Thank you for the explanation but that’s really not eli5. Maybe if the parents of the 5 year old were stock traders. I’m still very lost
Better 30k shares so you won't get margin call in case of a drop

Leverage means you're trading a CFD, Contract for difference. You don't actually own shares,its like a bet between you and your broker. So you have zero input on stock price whether you buy or sell.

Yeah I guess I am fucked then, since they are open from monday to friday 24/5 lol

-edit-

Their helppage also says I HAVE to wait 3 workdays before submitting a ticket
I am actually a bit noob to this. So that's why I wanted to understand how does Fed control the rising yield curve now?

Firstly does rising yield curve synonymously mean rising rates? And since Fed don't want that, they just buy the bonds being sold, making their balance sheet bigger?
 Talk of Inflation in 2021 on CNBC and Doomberg.  Obviously runaway inflation is terrible.  with rates at all-time lows, a fed pumping trillions to keep the econ pumping and Inflation rising, isn't this best case for equities?
Really
Say bye to this fool he's about to be homeless
Wtf this is gold! Could listen to him talk all day long! The Nike analogy was great. Instead of buying 200$ Nike, buy 200$ Nike stocks and watch it multiply. Bullish

Learning about options to be degens like the rest of you fine folk but something I'm stuck on. When I'm looking at obvious stocks like GME I see calls are super high premium and seem not worth it, is the trick to find ones that are dirt cheap before they hit mainstream?
Pleas touch me with your penis.
Isn't monday closed?
Lmao
Nice done!
All I want is 1 Papa Elon Tweet for GME

I just googled what the fuck an FD is and that’s hilarious.
Impulsiveness is not payed Well here, but it’s recommend You get in asap if You are talking about the GME play, though it’s a one in a lifetime thing.
For future plays, make sure You learn to do some due dilligence, make technical analysis, learn to distinguish between hype (pump and dumps) and actual sensible plays.
Dont jump in on options immidiately and to learn to hold inspite of massive down days.

Stonks only go up! Welcome to the special ed classroom!

I meannnnnn. 🤞🤞🚀🚀🚀🚀 ...  but just because they are shutting down most physical locations and doing e-commerce doesn't mean they'll dominate the market.  Gamers do the vast majority of game purchases through the inbuilt online stores for consoles... as well as buying games on Steam for PC... i'd wager it does about as good (either a little better, or a little worse) than Amazon for selling game related purchases.

But who knows. Maybe they'll come up with something really clever that changes the market entirely! So... fuck it... TO THE MOOOOOOOOOOOON
694.20
History maker right here
Here's the worst part it was BBBY what I bought into 😔 i was doing this shit while driving.
Yeah I can imagine SEC prosecuting a reddit forum saying “look all these memes are the proof of market manipulation!”
I know I'm preaching to the choir, but those what ifs will kill ya. Dm near tossed a measly 500 on AMD puts the Friday before the crash in March. would have made around 80k off of it (I'm too drunk to remember exacts, so give or take 30k. Needless to say, change your life money for my college ass. I'd be driving my dream car. Which to be fair, is an rx8). To make it worse, had I gone full balls to the walls and done the series of trades I oussie sout on (I believe target puts and tsla calls? Again, drunk) it would eventually been around 5mil.

Could have just as easily pissed it all away.

I don't know where I'm going with this. Believe in Elon, pray Biden keeps our savior JPow, and hold to the end.
ARKG all G
i wont have to jerk off for a week, thanks :)

&#x200B;

and fuck you
I went for a similar strategy, bought a bulk at 10.80 then at 10.00... now y have 2160 shares at avg $10.40... at this price is pretty much free money.
This is not the place nor the time to ask this kind of advice

BUY GME RETARD

~~only gamble on money you don't need~~
Using the Black-Scholes Model, if the IV is ~34%, then the options contract premium would be $1.549 for TSLA with 14 months to expiry with a $690 strike and ~$330 underlying.

Everyone called me paper hands when I backed out of BB with 1200 shares at 11.10 or so, now it’s down to about 9.84.
Whatever you do, please do not bet against treasuries, the fed is on a mission to keep yields down as rising interest rates would crash the economy.  Private actors might sell treasuries but fed will support them indefinitely.
200 shares for now, more on Tuesday. I'm with you

Oh but I thought you just said he was “always green”? Lmao you call having calls on a stock that tanks from 900 to 300 “a bit red” when that loss was probably 10x your portfolio
The movie stonk is next
Maybe. Thing is that multiple sites are saying that overall short interest increased.
My house, problem is, it's about 1 mil of construction costs but we only did a construction loan for 550, so i have to front the other 450k out of pocket. I just didnt' like the idea of being so cash strapped, i had 200k in my retirement accounts (am 29) i could've been still pretty safe to risk it, but i was too scared considering the economic climate
Added another 100 shares to bring me up to 260. Plan to sell my 1/22 calls early next week and buy even more! 💎🖐 muthafuckas!!!!
classic mistakes i made this week : 

1) Sold too early  
2) Sold too late / aka not selling the rip / "diamond handing" to a loss  
3) Chased the high flyers  
4) Sold my hedges early  
5) Didn't buy puts even though i knew a Friday sell off was coming

aand finally i yolo'd all that was left into weekly calls EOD for the bounce back (probably the best decision out of those) . Lfg

My brokerage is not allowing me to set limit order for more than 50 percent of the last trade price.

Dude, GME was talked about for months. There is tons of DD including a 20 page Pdf. This is just the climax of that move, is not a pump and dump. Is a company rising from their grave. When you say to pump something with no reason is market manipulation and it's illegal

I already do that. I have never ever paid interest on credit card debt. I get all my travel free via points. Just had to open 32 credit cards and make sure to get the intro offer and close them before the annual fees kick in. Heck in March when the market hit bottom took 40K out on CC loans to invest in the market. That 3% fee is the only money I have ever given to the Credit Card companies.

Edit: Of course like an idiot I bought TSLA puts in Jun so when the 0% rate is over this March have to figure something out.
There's this one girl who's into me who has a really nice face but no ass... Such a damn shame
exactly. the market will not crash and the bubble is not gonna burst because the central banks just keep printing monies
“A call option is OTM if the underlying price is below the strike price. A put option is OTM if the underlying's price is above the strike price”

So I think this means you have the right to buy the shares for e.g. $100 dollars each, but they are only worth e.g. $90 dollars each. You have no commitment to buy so you just walk away. Is that right?

how is there 11% 🌈🐻 on GME???  are there even any  🌈🐻 thesis for GME???
Yes it really is
Nah I love my private time
Gme shares
They pay the brokerages. RH, TD, JPMC etc. Some brokerages will pay you, but not all. Because you're using their money for margin purchases. Those shares are theirs essentially until paid back.

Also can you see the text anymore for the original post?
Holy crap. Well done.

>Should have done this yesterday, f

I feel like that's my reaction to basically everything I learn about trading.

A bigger factor than 3 day weekend was options expiring. When an option poofs OTM, brokers sell the underlying share to get rid of it. Tons of options activity means big selloff of basically everything that had options out.
So if you exercise all of these options into shares you’ll end up with 88,500 shares? Or $73M based on today’s closing price? (Assuming 885 million is the shares outstanding value)

Makes sense to just exercise the contracts and wait the year so you can sell for long term gains. That’s what I’d do.

And I thought my 3,500 shares of TSLA were a lot. lol.

Is this reasoning correct?

Low interest rates ➡️ Increased Liquidity ➡️ Currency Devaluation/Asset value rapid appreciation ➡️ Treasury bonds become less attractive ➡️ Bonds sold ➡️ Yield goes up ➡️ Interest rates are increased to keep up with increasing yield / central bank buys bonds to drive yield down???

I am gonna get down voted for asking this, aren't I? 😷

Ya I know the formula , pe= Share price / eps. Eps= earnings/ no.shares . I also watched YouTube videos on how to do it but I can’t find one that explains it the way I can understand and non that shows an example of a company. That’s why I keep finding it odd. I tried doing tsla PE also but I got 1000 instead of 1600

 If possible, can anyone help do an example here of any company ? Thanks in advance 🙏

So I went and found the [2008 Volkswagen data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/VOW.DE/history?period1=1222819200&period2=1225411200&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true). It had its short-squeeze on Oct. 27th & 28th 2008, which came just after a weekend, and the high levels were reported to be near 1000 Euros (although that doesn't show that high of a price in the yahoo table for some reason). However, it also shows that the volume of trades spiked on those days, and 20 days before.

Meanwhile, [the same GME data](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/history?period1=1607990400&period2=1610755200&interval=1d&filter=history&frequency=1d&includeAdjustedClose=true) shows the huge volume of trades on Wednesday 13th, preceeded by a huge volume 20 days before that. So shouldn't we believe that the short-squeeze here is over? I can see an argument that after the long weekend we could see another push, but just how much volume *should* we see for GME?

This study called "[Detecting the great short squeeze on Volkswagen](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927538X16300075#t0005)" tells an interesting part of the story that gives me hope...

&#x200B;

>The stock price reaction to Porsche's news was surprisingly slow. Price discovery evolved over two days. On Monday 27 October 2008 Volkswagen stock opened at 350 euros, which was up 67% on its previous Friday close, but not too alarming as it had been trading at that level just  two weeks earlier. The price rose that day to 635 euros before closing at 520 euros, both of which were new records. On Tuesday 28 October 2008  it opened at 500 euros and traded as high as 1005 euros before closing at 945 euros.  
>  
>...  
>  
>[Bloomberg (2008a)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927538X16300075#bb0035)  describes the situation as an unprecedented short squeeze, yet the  market response to all this information seems surprisingly slow. Why did  the short sellers hang on for so long when the tide was moving against  them? Perhaps they remained focused on the long-term anticipated drop in  price rather than the risk of being squeezed in the meantime. Their  long-term view would eventually prove correct but this was too late for  those closed out by stop losses on 27 or 28 October 2008.  
>  
>The biggest challenge for traders would have been to identify when the  trend was changing from a gradual price rise to the onset of the  conditions for the price spike. The infinite short squeeze became public  knowledge when Porsche declared its interests on 26 October 2008, but  this was a Sunday — the markets were closed and most traders would not  have been watching the news feeds. Market participants inevitably take  different times to observe and respond to news, even with news as  significant as Porsche's option interest in Volkswagen. Nonetheless it  should be sufficient for a few alert traders to start a reaction on  Monday 27 October 2008 after the markets reopen.

Alright, to see if I got it right: they bleed when price stays above (price they borrowed at) - (interest). Interest is very high for this stock because many want to short sell. Price stays high when we keep up the demand.

Also, aren't they supposed to pay *us* interest for borrowing our stocks? Where cash?

Stock goes up, premium goes up

Stock goes down, premium goes down

Pretty sure stock is going up, so you'll be able to sell that contract for a profit  

edit - just realized that said 2021 and I didn't make the connection that 2021 is this year.  Kinda risky, stock could go up next week or it could go down.. if it goes down then you'll lose money on that call.  But if it goes up, you'll be able to sell for a profit
But that’s more than the tax he would have owed if he just sold the contracts himself. It doesn’t make sense to lose all that going this way.

Calm down my dude. WSB is a joke. You get one good move on GME and think Wall Street cares more than a drop of piss about you? 

“We gotta stop these overzealous retail traders on WSB from investing more of their dumb money into the system”, said no one on Wall Street ever ever ever. 

They’re actually marketing this sub right now to attract an even larger dumb money pool. They gave us a billion, but they’ll take back two.

I'm sorry for your bad timing, it happened to me the 1st December as well.

This stock is crazy. TBH I don't know why it soared that much, but I wasn't surprised at all it crashed after the highs yesterday.

Don't worry, I've been bagholding this one for a month and a half before seeing the light. 

I did what you plan to do : average down. I know it sucks to see a -15 / -20% loss so quickly after you take position, but the stock is still undervalued. You just paid a premium that you can lower.

I don't have a huge position (50% of my portfolio is in GME, 25% in steel stocks). I'm in with 53 shares at 7.65 average.

General consensus is that if a short squeeze happens (and it does seem inevitable) it'll be within the next week or two. 

As for what the max will be, nobody knows. Could be $50. Could be $500. Could be fuckin' $5000. But I mean, good luck upholding that price w/ everyone selling.

Yes but it's not 158% outstanding for 1/15, it's 158% overall? So while there will be pressure it's not like 158% of shares need sold over the next six days.

Yeah, sorry for not being clear; I just meant you can’t short with a market order. You have to short with a limit order higher than the bid price.
Which has absolutely nothing to do with my comment. And "finding" shares have nothing to do with a short squeeze.

And is also building with Amazon the App Store for cars across manufacturers that is going to become a multi billion dollar business in just a few short years. This is AMD at two and Nvidia at 10
It is the same as with Varta (German Battery maker). Almost 50% shortet, with interests of 50%.

In Europe we are waiting for the short squeeze too.
People said the same about amazon compared to Walmart. The value isn’t where it’s at now, it’s based on its ability to grow.
You guys are all fucking retarded talking about shares being cheap at $100 when it's literally trading at $35. I guarantee not a single downvoter has made any significant money in this market.
Nothing like cooking a fat ass fucking meal for yourself at 1am for the gainz 💪🏻

What the fuck
Bro that’s like dropping out of college and quitting your job to win the lottery.  You’re exposing yourself to so much risk for no good reason.
Yeah, too many people now being oh this stock is cool all in and hope people say sure. GME fundamentally changed with RC and it is positioned well. This isn't just a meme, GME is a play and we caught a short overextended during the play which has increased the potential for a big bag. It isn't some oh Comcast is going to kill earnings let's go all in. First of all, Comcast can suck deez nuts. Second of all, there is no play and no short. Comcast has it's territory and charges its rates, it's like a utility stock.  GME has been a developing play over a month at least and we noticed Melvin thought playtime was over but it was just getting started. 

But we need to be extremely vigilant and aware of spam bots. Too many people hoping their stock gets memed next and they get the 10 bagger. Especially watch out for BB vs BBY vs BBBY because I have already noticed a lot of people buying one of these three thinking it is another. GM is clearly not GME but people are buying bestbuy and saying all aboard BB town and realizing that it has nothing to do with blackberry.
You have to search up a stock market gambling retard podcast , it’s out where ..... somethere.
No prob. Honestly my passion rn for it is an educated hunch I’ll research in earnest this weekend. A lot of news stories and tTA I’ve seen are kind of in a haze in my head, but it’s got like 75 catalysts and looks like they’ll avoid bankruptcy. Which is the story of GME
Started over with $3.5k for New Years and turned it into $30k. Now half my account is TLRY calls and half of it is GME calls. Lets make it $300k!

It’s a good bear trap. On Tuesday this is going to open flat and then start moving up again hard. The good news is the fade today closed the mornings gap which needed to happen to continue our journey to the promise land.
Fall back, u aint full retard yet
High short interest is there for almost a year already, everyone thought they with go bankrupt, but all the recent news pushed it higher and higher. Short couldn't or wouldn't close down their position because it could easily trigger a squeeze, or because they don't want to admit to losing a huge amount of money

can someone give me some help on how to cancel a limit sell order on robinhood. i set it to $420 but i want to cancel it and make it $800...
🌈🐻
Nah.

3-5% per week is the target, 1-2% per week is the minimum.

If I can't do that through swing trading and options, it's getting kicked out the portfolio stat.
Not bad write up, but there are some things about sellers and selling options that would really help with this more..


I can't go into them now, but essentially learning to sell options first, will give you the best insight on when to buy them.. 

You'll notice nobody on WSB talks about selling options.. and that is why, it's the secret to buying them better...

If you try to sell options and they wont' fill, or right after you sell them, the bid/ask jumps etc..

there are little games the market plays and goes through..

But selling options tells you a lot.. 

I always try to sell options first, then I know what would, have been/is a good buy..

also it's great for spreads etc..

as for your positions, well, I think there is more down next week, but then we will continue up..

So it will be interesting to see how your calls do.. Although I can see a small pump that you'll probably get out of the calls on SPY before it dumps some more..
Actually we can. We're just having fun with the noobs
Yes
Well this is before the run up so it could be lower by now
Browns run game is phenomenal.  +10 is a lock.

Me too
Serious question.
How many people read Seeking Alpha 's articles?
They get publicized in investing.com and a lot of other sites.

And why a definitely-biased-article is any different from a definitely-biased-post?
Both are written by somebody who calls himself an analyst (in WSB it means he likes receiving anal, though).
Both gives read on the situation of a stock, its management and gives a conclusion that can be translated as "it may go up" "it may go down".

If somebody follow up and buy a stock, why is this a problem?

In the same discussion, if somebody on Twitter with a lot of followers said "Tesla is overpriced IMHO" and the stock tanked because a lot of people believed what this person said, why is that a problem?
[deleted]
Honestly, If you’re day/swing trading and playing options, you will run your account to zero multiple times before you start to not be so retarded and begin to actually make money consistently. Then, making a few hundred bucks most months should be realistic. But as a beginner things will Prolly be less painful if you’ll buy and hold stuff that you’ve actually put in time and energy to research, and paper trade on the side daily for practice.    Don’t let the down votes hurt your feelings, they’re trying to save you from Yourself.

Holy shit, 200k. This is why I come here good sir
I don't understand how the split works...

I was holding USO calls back in March and got 100% fucked by the reverse split they had. It drastically increased the strike price and reduced the number of shares.

You are saying that this split not only gave him 5x his original contracts also but reduced the strike price to a fifth of what it was?

Also, do you know of a tool that allows is to see the history of options? So a tool that I can use to look back 2 years ago on a specific date and see all of the details for a particular options contract?

And how can I find similar long-shots? Cheap multi-year leaps on companies that MIGHT take off. I can't ever seem to find someone selling a leap for some long-shot price. Like for a $200 call on a stock that is currently $20.
Yes fuk you
I’m under no delusions that WSB caused this but GME isn’t done
I have never seen a gang on WSB this committed to fighting an institution who is shorting their stonk. This is epic. Hold strong GME gang!

Sort by new for the good shit here. The info would be dead by the time podcast was done recording, much less when it finished uploading and you listened to it.

If you want a podcast, go listen to something on fundamental or technical analysis so you can learn how to do your own Due Diligence on tickers you randomly pick up. If there's one glaring weakness I see on wsb it's that most people seem unable to separate the wheat from the chaff.

You have a point, but you should 1lso realise that the amount of shares short is way bigger than the amount that can be covered with calls, otherwise over 2/3 of the people that owb gme should have sold a covered call, which i firmly believe is not the case

That same play looks to be roughly 75x to 100x more expensive today.

Would take $9500 and only for 1 call and lets say it did a 5-1 split again you only have 5 options.

That play was fucking dirt cheap when he took it.
This evening I visited my local dive bar where in the restroom I saw a small sickly man performing oral sex with part of the paper towel holder shoved up his ass. He turns to me and blurts out (surprisingly well with a dick in his mouth) "why yes, I do buy weekly puts on Robinhood, how could you tell?"
So this is not a proper place to park?

Ok so keep checking wallstreetbets. Got it
Okay, you convince me. What strike do you think I should go with? Got 6k left, after losing it all on pfe.
Taxes gonna hurt the stonks and that hurts all of us. Think of it as the penalty fee for making a profit. If that penalty goes up, then the final profit is smaller and then EPS goes down and your calls still print just not nearly as fat. Then you make half the tendies every week on the stonks and you have to dump in more of your salary to meet the same gains, or you need to make double the trades which doubles the risk. So yes, even though your taxes from your job will stay the same, it will fuck up the tendie train. Of course, we will still make money, it's just a matter of if you want a lambo this year vs needing to keep flipping another year hoping maybe your ford fiesta money can bag over 10 times.
Holy fucking shit you beast

Elon is this centuries christ figure. If he gets humans to mars, no fundamental measure matters at all to stockholders. The market is worth what people believe, and if people believe in Elon, he’s basically worth infinity.
Anyways telsa’s continued run is in part to a slow, unending short squeeze that’s been going on for 18 months. Just one autist’s opinion 🤷‍♂️

ive been in and out of this stock since $4... Gme has a very nasty habit of falling 20% in one day --usually at earnings or some market correction.  Wont buy it in the 30s and would hate to see it correct down to the 20s for no particular reason.   This stock is so manipulated that I have to be very careful where to choose my strikes...
Shares is the way to go here
appreciate it
Thanks. I meant like if you buy stocks and then sell at a loss in less than 30 days, isn't that considered wash sale and not be considered in tax deductions?
Right? Like ok so he targets a price that’s less than half what it currently trades for, meaning he expects it to fall...

They end up being sold off at a tiny discount (hoping under 1%) and that incentive is what the buyer needs to be convinced to buy them from him.

Yeah there will be a certain time, could be between half a day to a couple days where you will be able to sell stock at a high course. Hopefully longer. Really depends on how the short squeeze develops. Then it will probably fall to “normal” 

Tuesday and later you will be able to start see the price increases probably. To play it safe you should put a sell limit order if you dont have the time to constantly overview your portfolio

First,I agree with you and mods should ban those users quickly.

Second, maybe those comment come from Melvin Capital or other hedge funds trying to shut down this sub. Lets say SEC shut down this sub. How much time until some other sub is created? Are they going to track all ip addresses?

What about people that try to manipulate stocks in tv like Jim Cramer? What he tried to do this week with gme is blatant market manipulation. Yet, nothing happened.
I have mine at 694.20
Have you tried not doing that?
>Yes, but what most retards here dont realize just how expensive PLTR already is.  They are already a 40billion dollar company.  There is a LOT to prove with that valuation.

Lol word, they just look at share price and think PLTR is like GME. PLTR has a market cap of 40 billion and GME is 2.4billion at the moment ($35 a share).

30% of my portfolio is in PLTR but it takes a lot to move the stock price unfortunately.
I’ve always been lurking for long calls and I’ve never seen anything even close to be so cheap.

No accident about it
ah, didn't know there was a name for this. i do it

you're right, it does work, but it gets exhausting when you're being antagonized in person because you're shutting yourself down

for instance, trying not to be too happy because it would make the antagonist jealous. it's not too different from avoidant behaviour

thanks though for the clip

Patience is a virtue.
Short sellers used to not be able to sell on down candles (i.e. down momentum) because it would be possible to manipulate the price further down. This was revised after a lawsuit following a crash.

Now short sellers are allowed to sell on down candles, but if the stock drops more than 10% in a trading day, then they are apparently no longer allowed to sell short on down candles for the rest of the trading day. 

So we saw gamestop drop 10%, then that rule went into effect, and they couldn't continue to manipulate the price down as aggressively

Definitely wasn't anywhere close to 300k. It wasn't even 1/2 of 300k. It wasn't even 1/3 of 300k. It wasn't even 1/4 of 300k. It wasn't even 1/5 of 300k. It was 1/6 of 300k. For those here who can't do math 1/6 of 300k is 50k. 50k is what DFV started with.

For some additional info, $FOLD is "predicted" to give a data readout for its Phase 3 PROPEL study at the WORLD symposium meeting, February 8-12. An analyst report I came across by SVB Leerink estimates potential upside of +25% on positive readout and -40% on a negative readout. That report is from the beginning of December though, so if the stack has gained since then, some of the upside might be factored in.
And it was with those dead unmoving glassy eyes that the doll in the corner of my aunts basement room looked at me and turned it’s head towards me. I continued drinking while laughing at the thoughts in my head.

Stop asking questions. Who said you could ask questions
Today is Jan 16, 2021. I still agree with OP. 

  
Facts are facts. Like Burry said, 90% of Tesla revenue comes from cars. Meanwhile, the production of cars is still way behind other traditional car makers. Then how do you think it's not a car company currently? IMO, it will at least take 10 years to start seeing the fruits from their technology. If you look at Apple, they took 10 years+ to build the monopolistic ecosystem, in which whatever products they launch, they will dominant the market. 

It seems to me people are acting like the people did back in the dot com bubble. They have lost their minds. Plus the money printing leads to this. Makes complete sense.

PE 1600 - Car makers are not gonna grow 10 fold in few years. They grow gradually, like 20% per year. Even they grow 50X in few years, your investment needs 32 years to return. I can't convince myself at least and I wouldn't say this is a nice bargain in the long run. 

Don't get me wrong. I am long Tesla for the next 10 years and I am a huge fan of them. But I'm short Tesla in half a year and it will likely returns to a more reasonably price. No one knows the exact time. It's a stupid question to ask. The price currently is way too expensive and people are out of their minds (not just into Tesla, but other financial assets as well). No one will know when it will happen.

In short, it is definitely a good bet on Tesla puts in the first half year. I would also do for a tiny amount at least.

My Fidelity margin percentage increased from 70% to 75%. Doesn’t affect me whatsoever since I’ve been in for months. This mostly affects buys from this week forward. It’s always a good idea to have some dry powder anyway.
Light bridge is a pretty cool company doing research on new safer lower temperature burning fuel and some other next level research. They are a Research only company making no profit but they seem to have a lot of funding. This is a company you hold and forget about for a long time. 

Unfortunately it seems that a lot of organizations doing the most next level research are mostly privately funded and not traded 

I am also still looking too
No more than Tesla was hurt by slowly killing off those who bet against it.

This is exactly what he is calling you out on.

Making a totally retarded call and then being deep in -100% while everyone is telling you that you're retarded is a totally different animal.

You mess with the bull you get the horns.
3 shares? I don't know what your financial standing is but honestly whatever it may be I would just let that baby run. You risk losing what, 120 dollars? Extremely unlikely too. For a potential $1000 gain if you just hold it for a year or two. It's one of the best risk reward you can get, the company is very unlikely to go anywhere and has far more solid financials than even Tesla or other similar companies. And 120 dollars is hardly life changing money. So I would just let the order go through
well the idea is, check out his % gains. If he had stock, he’d be up a lot, but his gains would be nowhere near something like the 14,000% you see there.

Options are more risky as they can expire worthless, but if you win the trade, you make a much higher return % than you would from the common stock 

Rough example: stock with a $100 share price.  You buy a $90 in the money call, for a price of $1000 (ignoring premium for this example). The reason the contract is worth $1000 is because if the you could exercise the contract at any moment to buy 100 shares for $90, and then immediately turn around and sell them each for $100, which of course is a total of $1,000

Ok so now say the stock goes from $100 to $110. If you had $1000 worth of stock, you had made $100 profit. 

But since you had the $1000 in the call option: 1 contract = 100 shares. Since you can buy the 100 shares for your strike price at $90, and sell them for $110, that’s $20 profit per share, so x100 for the total profit on the contract, which is $200.
Being short a put is literally not a synthetic long. A synthetic long is buying a call and selling a put. You've only got half a synthetic long, and it's the half that has capped profit if/when GME moons, and all of the downside risk. Plus, the point of buying shares instead of options is to squeeze the shorts, and short puts don't help with that. If you're gonna do this with options at LEAST establish a proper synthetic long so you're not leaving money on the table.
As a student, while others get themselfes iPads and Gaming PCs, i just burn my saved money with some half dead hypestonks

100 shares @ 8.01€
No problem! There’s lots of index funds that track the SP500 but VTSAX tracks thousands of US companies as opposed to just 500.
I confess I learned quite a bit about short squeezes the last few days.  I bought some GME but like a true autist I’m going to do some backup research after giving in to FOMO.

You don't control anything.

It would be like having a job if your employer could fire you at any time and drain you bank account.

Not good for a primary income.

Doubly so because start off saying you want high risk (you said medium too but we all know).
But sir this is a Wendy's
I don't think they're retarded, I think they are preparing their end game for getting out of this trade. They are averaging up (down?) so if the stock falls back to $20 they don't be nearly as deep under water. With the cost of borrowing in pretty confident we'll see another assault on price potentially back to the $17 support before the squeeze sets off for real. It'll be a disaster for Melvin if it quadruples from $35 compared to $17
You won’t work
FUCK I had NIO $10 Leaps for 2022 fuck me
Sell order for half at 100, half of the remainder at 200 and the last lot, Melvin can ask you to politely sell for 1k+
that sounds like a great idea.

Its asking me the "price type" and i selected STOP LIMIT ON QUOTE What do I set for the "limit price" and the "stop price" ? I heard the magic number is 694.20 but im not sure what field to enter it in. also, should I set the duration for 60 days? If i can get this figured out ill probably buy a few dozen more on Tuesday.

Thanks for the help
I believe the mostly agreed on upon play is GME -> BB -> PLTR right now. But feel free to vary things up a bit, eg some are in BB early, many plan to hold GME long run, etc

VTSAX is an index fund that basically tracks the stock market with exposure to many different companies. It’s considered a low risk investment and returns 8% a year on average. Though in recent years much more than that. So he parks 2mil in there and he earns 160k a year.

GME shares
I like this. I like you.
This was really helpful thank you. 

My first thought is why does it matter if the short sellers are forced to pay a high price (1000 rather than 35)? Then I watched a video on YouTube and apparently the idea is when the shorters are forced to buy the shares as their investment expires then the price will rise even higher and everyone wins. 

The question is assuming the increase in price is driven by the expectation that the shorters have to buy shares when their investments are executed, when is this in this case? Presumably shortly after the price will tumble (unless the fundamentals of the business have changed since before).

What does 200% margin maintenance requirements mean? You gotta have 2x equity than how much your GME is worth?
How are the feds stopping this? Is it that uptick rule because of the 10% loss?
cash out 1.5k so ur at the start if everything goes to shit. perfect plan/s
Fuck you and have fun you fucking idiot
Wow a whole $12. Just enough to get a new cumrag for your wife's boyfriend after he finishes on her tits every night.
Bought 2k. Holding till the $30 or bust.
I mean, that's with everything right? Besides, I feel like there's tons of posts now critiquing the game, or making suggestions.

Anyhow, I play it for free and I have like 4 5 stars,  and 20k gems left, so no reason for me to complain.
Do whatever you would’ve done had you not had a massive loss.
Excellent contribution OP, may your tendies be hot and fresh
just play earnings bruh
Imagine someone YOLO $10k or $100k into the same trade.

Actually making the Squeeze occur might take time. So be patient and hold. Then we can shift our attention to what ever other overly shorted companies we see.

Will wait to see how Tuesday plays out. I know more negative news regarding COVID 19 and political bs will come again... I’ll see if TSM has a nice dip and will jump in if it does. TSM is one of the few stocks I know will continue to dominate this year so regardless wouldn’t mind paying a few extra to hop board.
What? I joined TheCorporation a while ago in case any DD popped up but rarely check it. You guys aren't abandoning the sub or anything are you? It's kind of a pain in the ass with how everything there is always so fucking cryptic.
> This play is literally a 98 percent chance of loosing all your money . Very high risk.

Losing $1500 forty-nine times out of 50, and making several million 1 time is still an insanely profitable bet that you should make every chance you get.

In the time you spent kicking yourself, you missed out on 12,115 chances to make tendies. Literally always another trade out there. Everything green on tuesday recovering from today, come make some money.

If you want my sob story, on tuesday I had my finger on the trigger for a whole 25~30 call spread that would've pulled in ~5m if I had done it. Holy shit board change isn't fully priced in, short squeeze stuff, etc. Instead, I decided to think on it and fell asleep in the middle of the day, waking up ~2hr after market close.
Can someone explain to me why the mods removed this? Are they worried about violating sec regulations or something?

Have you been hiding under a rock during the run where Nio went from $2 to &60+?
Just like welfare, it’s considered bad when the poors do it.
Keyword: “May” 
Nowhere did I say I was convinced it’d end at $67. 
Based on the technicals/chart as of 2 days ago, it had a fighting chance. Once it broke past the $61 support on a big red candle yesterday, we had no chance.

He bought 10 options for 1500ish, 1.50 each. The split put him up to 50 options.

See this post for the price range on the day OP made their play: https://old.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kya1hn/221084_gain_in_14_months/gjfizig/
I suffered through three short attacks that cost me $30k in Oct, another $40k in November (after earnings) and again in Jan for a $10k loss in unrealized profits.  After that earnings loss I tripled down and put 100% of my portfolio into GME.  

So Melvin Capital can kiss my arse over my current +150k and counting (still unrealized) profits.

Thats the one I use too. Its ETORO. Basically it says that if you reach a profit of 62,318 to automatically close the position. The same with loss.
I originally had calls for 1/22 @ 25 back when GME was like \~$21 last week. Sold for a 245% profit when GME hit the low-mid 30s on Wednesday. Now I'm invested in shares that I bought for around $36.

Yes. I mean i think the incredible promise of BB means we move up now into the teens and beyond, but longer dated calls (even 2023) make a lot of sense since they will make it into the periods where BB will start reporting an endless array of revenue generating deals.

TLDR; GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Fucking loved that game.
Ban this one. He’s one of them.
Well, so far so good. They're doing better than anyone thought possible. They're all over the news, and an analyst says it shot up because of long buying not a short squeeze yet. Now it's a matter of which side gives up first. Shorts are under time pressure since they're all on margin.

People are also speculating on a positive long-term with Cohen at the helm, and with all the hype, any good news that comes out is likely to spike it again, so my money is on long being the better option. 

It's always going to be a gamble, but if it goes down it ain't cos I sold.💎🙌

I have what people might be calling a crazy stupid question, I'm European. Is the short squeeze sth that only Americans, so people owning stocks on nyse for example, can be affected by, or can shorts also buy internationally to cover their positions?

Not working for me. Got an auto mod message saying don’t use Imgur
Any rule 4’ers here? I’m thinking about cashing about and putting it into my trading account but I know I will regret it. My reasons for selling are:

- I think this bull run is running out of steam (for the big ones at least)

- It would increase my trading money by 8x

- I pay more attention to to stocks now

- I can always buy MARA/RIOT calls for exposure

- Taxes are going to be a nightmare when I cash out so I might as well get it over with now

Why shouldn’t I sell?

The faster you do the DD the quicker you are to make a profit. So it makes sense to buy the ticker then so the DD.
What are the chances we choose NIO as the next meme stock?
I’m holding until $420
MSOS is the only cannabis ETF I would buy. Will be $100 a share in 12 months. Reminme!
Gotta get your swagger back. Make small trades until you feel confident again might be one way to get your swagger back but as a gambling man I’d put it all in $GME and hope for the squeeze.
That's smart I'll probably sell cc's thru earnings n take advantage of that IV. If they manage to surprise and I lose my shares, so be it. If it tanks, at least I'll pocket some premium

The fuck you saying? Tesla was Tesla already in 2019.
I've never looked at leaps before, but I just did the math and you're right. Only takes like a 34% increase over 2 years to break even on the call. Buying a couple contracts Tuesday at open, you've converted me to leaps my friend. Theta decay's like 1.7 cents per day, and that's a high estimate too

&#x200B;

Quick question though, what would you do when it hits Jan 2023 and you have the contract? Would anyone buy it that far ITM or would you have to exercise, then sell?
It’s ok swaggymedia, don’t beat him up, he also has autism.  But his is to the point where his username suggests he should get merit badges for dumb comments which is a special brand of retarded.  I think what we are all saying is GME 🚀🌕

Nice... seems like a smart play will ride it with you brotha next week.
Yeah I knew about the squeeze happening at some point. Who knows bro, I’m just speculating, no one knows how the market will react. If you are comfortable with your position then that is all that matters. Everyone’s risk management is different and I can respect that

Ban is canceled officially. Ma is still missing but isn't even CEO contrary to what many people here think. Ant Group incident was negative but has now been priced in. Current problem is still the waiting for financial investigation results form Chinese government and Jack ma appearing again. Will be lift off in a few weeks imo. Medium risk but very high reward if you get calls for April, June and August
I mean you couldn’t just buy shares and wait for it for the next run up and get some tendies? 🤔
If someone said to me give me 1500 and I will be back with 3.4m in less than two years but you will owe me 510k...I would take that trade in a heartbeat.

I know its not the exact situation here because the IRS did jack shit for him, but what are you really gonna do? The IRS brought down Capone...you are a flick of a wrist away from tax fraud and jail time.

I take my money, pay my fee to play the game, and put 3 mil in the bank.
I may try that out, when the real squeeze happens. Worried about getting shaken out, but that might mitigate it and in a real squeeze the price action probably won’t be so choppy. Thanks!
And I still won't buy it or GME ✊
And dont share with those doubters!
Maybe one time I’ll hit one of these 🤷‍♂️

They're not wrong, they're just assholes.

They are very wrong about GME though.  The the MOOOOOOOOOOON
I guess the whole idea is that an entire sub can force a stock with large short interest to give in. I don't claim to know if that's how it works, sounds almost too simple, will watch with intrigue

Great video, I really enjoyed that.

Fuck Mondays. I miss when Mondays were guaranteed to be green.
Don't click that.
Fellow noobie here.

Each investment is a risk.  With that out of the way, the WSB hive mind calls out the bullshit.  If you see a bunch of folks supporting a stock, then you should go for it (if you feel comfortable).

I'll be on that ship, Tuesday.

Friday's close: $823.77 TSLA, $9.55 BB

That's 86 BB to 1 TSLA

If BB goes up $1, then your TSLA's gotta go up $86 to match value.  That would set a new ATH for TSLA at almost $910.  It's much easier to see gains from a smaller stock than from a behemoth.

When BB hits $20, that would be $898.70 gains vs what ever the single TSLA stock would do for ya.  I'm no expert, but I know TSLA ain't gonna  🚀 over double its current value anytime this month.

&#x200B;

I know I'm a day late and I wish I saw this sooner, cause I would of made the swap before market close on Friday.  Also typing this out helped me see the logic everyone else is assuming we see. Catch ya on the Moon.
You proper fucked up. Go see a Wendy Rhoades and don't trade in the meanwhile. Selling near money puts for a squeezed stonk is retarded.

Yeah there’s lots of art and posts about artifacts, routes etc but whenever a criticism of the game is commented or posted a flock of white knights are always there defending any and all actions of the company. Like the game is really good but it’s not perfect and that’s ok but there are people who will blindly defend anything. If the devs shit in their mouth they will gladly accept it lol. It was back when I was still in it, so I’m not sure how it is right now.

More $$$ + more retardation = opportunities to do the same to bigger and bigger fish.

Just imagine if WSB single-handedly burned through all the short sellers in like a couple years? Then the market would explode unchecked into the biggest, most violent bubble known to man. We'll all be walking around with donkeys with pots clanging on the sides after that shit busts.

"The rush by short sellers to cover produces additional upward pressure on the price of the stock, which then can cause an even greater squeeze. Although some short squeezes may occur naturally in the market, a scheme to manipulate the price or availability of stock in order to cause a short squeeze is illegal." from https://www.sec.gov/investor/pubs/regsho.htm

But according to that site naked short selling to manipulate a stock is also illegal. well, guess what melvin did...

BB has been setting up these pieces for years.  We are now checkmate in 5 and SOME people are realizing it.  Hope its enough at this point to get the stock price out of the ABSURDLY cheap area.  by the time it's checkmate in 1, which will be in under 2 years, BB's value will be 10 to 20x where we are today.  That's why I'm never selling these shares.  the options are more speculative because I'm counting on checkmate in 5 generating significant market interest, but who knows.  Sure seems like it now that since everyone is so focused on automotive and EV.
It's nice to take a breather once a week. Except long ass weekends though. These suck so hard. MLK would have wanted us to trade on his bday. The stock market is racist.

Only two analysts have provided a price target on CNN. This means that analysts haven’t yet caught up to the stock - as with most stocks early stage.
but at what point do u think the max will hit? Whether its 100 or 55 or whatever, do you think it will happen in the next week or two?
Oh no haha.  
 from what I understand short interest is simply the # of shares that have been shorted.  
Also the short seller has to pay a fees to the lender of the shares. This is usually a certain fee%. i just wanted to see if this is what determines the fees payed and what the actual calculation was

"Your honor, it is securities fraud for their CEO to not inform me about the risk to my investment due to my own retardation."
I mean that is pretty insane growth lol and OP got hella lucky. But even then loosing $1500 isn’t that bad, to me at least. I’d have taken that bet if I had any idea about call options but I’m not that retarted yet.
Is etoro not purely CFD trading? Because if it is I don't think you have anything to worry about, but I could be wrong entirely.
Oh great and mighty one! I beseech you once more. Let's say i have crystal ball and I just know I can pin a butterfly... How do you achieve that maximum potential displayed the day after expiration by most analysis tools. Do you have to sell the long itm leg on Friday and let your short middle leg die slowly over the weekend? That would require collateral? Could you sell one debit spread out of the butterfly and let the credit spread die?

Wtf is a NIO house?
I’ve been following your post on the mass selling due to expired options yesterday, with great interest. I’m curious to know more about what you think are the potential cases and catalysts for the GME short squeeze. It seems like this is very complicated as many months back, GME had an insane level of short interest already. People seem convinced that the short squeeze is imminent. Why? Why now?
Any obvious weekly plays to consider next week ? Besides GME calls / shares
That dip was a blessing but I wish I had the extra 200k to buy 20,000 shares
Because they ‘don’t care’ what their cost basis will be, they just have a position they want to open and trust the market will get them an appropriate price point. It’s not hard to set a limit order for the ask price.
Yeah, I know ☹️

When the stock goes down you have to maintain the margin loan rate from your broker. As your stock price decreases, the balance is deducted from your account- if your account is at zero when your stock declines... you can be margin called to maintain your margin maintenance balance ✌️

Corn about to short squeeze, get in here bros! 🤡🤡🤡
Who cares.
BB is still only valued at 1/4 of what NOK is, even after the recent run. I don't see NOK moving much anytime soon.
depends

as an example, if your LEAPs are way OTM, and the stock doesn't move up by expiry, your LEAPs expire worthless, and the money's gone

with shares, if they're flat, you can still sell them even if you've made no gains
yeah man, it's honestly very health and mind draining.
Poop comes out of a hole and goes into one.
Yep you got it right. Welcome to the power of options. Use it retardedly. 

I was up 12,000% on one of my GME calls. Yes, twelve thousand. $80 -> $10,000. If I had enough balls to go up to my yolo limit I'd be at half a milly.
Getting his finger nails ripped off one by one. Poor guy.
Yeah, I could definitely see corn as an additional catalyst. But cathie bought it for ARKQ and both companies showed off some automated farming stuff at CES. It seems like a pretty good leap play to me.
People into bb are the ones that are too dumb to understand what’s going on with gme and bb is giving me a pltr vibe. ( long term hold , were going to have to listen to bag holders get us excited about their failed short term play for a month).   Pltr to the moon ! Next year
This comment and all the thump up assure me that I’m in the right place. I’m short the put it’s a synthetic long. I will be buying GME if it drop.

The way I see it, GME is happening NOW. BB may be starting now, but you can always hop onthat one after the GME play, stay strong, hold.

my plan is to take a loss on some of my other positions and buy some shares on Tuesday and set a sell limit at 694.20 so they cant loan my shares out. good bye Melvin.

My strat has been green energy and EVs since last feb. bought 47 shares of plug with an avg price of 8.20 at this point. Buying monthly calls early on when the sub gets hyped on a ticker. I made 2k the days before thanksgiving with the PLTR run. A couple weeks ago I bought some ICLN calls that printed nicely. TSM calls have done me well too.

Edit: worth mentioning that I hadn’t bought any Tesla sadly. Bought a few nio shares around 22 and have been holding since.
Thanks!

could you please explain, if he initially thought GME was gonna go up and exercise options at the expiration date, wasn't it easier just to buy stocks at that time and hold until today?

Haha dude he’s in a fucking gulag somewhere.
Just lying low? I’m gonna actually assume you’re being sarcastic with me

IMO disney is going to be a 1T$ stock in the next few years there is NO other brand more well known than disney across the world. Streaming will take off crazy after this year, cruises, parks, hotels, theaters, games, live tv, sports, and lastly merchandise, can’t go to a single store and not find mandalorian merchandise, think about all of disney’s upcoming big budget shows about 30 plus of them, 30 mandalorians. A few might not turn out amazing but the marvel/star wars/pixar fan base will buy anything.
If the economy collapses in the near future and we start living Mad Max style, the first thing I want to see is Cramer vs Dave Ramsey fight till death in the thunderdome

Yeah but they come out of your estate so you haven’t avoided it.
GME IV is really really high right now. IMHO I would bye shares. I reinvested my call option I sold into shares today.
Corn: so many factors to consider... 1. World demand (net buyers Europe, China, SE Asia) 2. US demand for livestock feed and ethanol production, 3. Mid-west derecho - its severity, 4. World aggregate harvest forecast - particularly Brazil & Argentina - expect bumper crops

Any combination of factors can rebalance USDA predictions and corn yields per acre. I expect CORN to hit $16 and corn to hit $5.15 per bushel this harvest season. The yields may not be as robust as forecast, less than 175 bushels per acre is my estimate based on drought severity and longevity, delayed planting, and latent demand increases. I think commodities in general will all move up in price with more Fed quantitative easing and stimulus money hitting the streets.

Good job. If I was you(keeping the addiction to Tesla) I would sell and take half out to buy properties, Tesla car...etc and the other half  I would just sell weekly OTM puts where at the price could hit 20MA or 50MA in the daily chart. with this method:

* Unlikely to loss money 
* You will collect great premiums every week!
* even if Tesla dipped down, you will buy it at the cheap price of the OTM strike you have sold

Good luck!
Imagine being retarded enough to use TA terms on imaginary internet money... oh wait, you are.

> His bet was the stock would increase appx 270% to reach the $690 strike.

Your math is way fucking off. Oct 25th, 2019 the price was $328. He only needed 110% to hit his strike price.

In the 4 months preceding his 'purchase', Tesla had already gone up 77% from $185 to $328. It was still one of the most volatile stocks. No fucking way he got those contracts for that price.

This is the way.
Sorry what do you mean cannot be considered?

All losses are considered. But it’s just long and long pair up first. Then short and short. Then it’s net loss. So if you lost 4k and it’s all short term, you can still deduct 3k this year and carry over 1k worth of short term losses for next year.

Btw, if you get a software and do it automatically come April, it does this very quickly but it’s good to know by hand too.
how high will it soar????
Don't.

That’s what I’m trying to figure out but it’s not the first person to suggest that they are also shorting BB 🤔
Yeah that's what I meant. Only use 4k to buy 4k worth of shares and then when my 50k hits I'd probably just turn margin off and pay it back
My bad...  didn’t go check before replying to that.
You have to disable margin on the account or call the broker for the purchase, make the purchase and tell them you do not want to use margin.

I think mine is instant but maybe that's cuz I have margin privliges. I fucked around and bought some stock not realizing it was on margin a few months ago. Now my shit is like 75% used up. Very seductive.
I saw earnings were coming and I was going to use that run up. Now I’m waiting for some Intel outsourcing confirmation this week. I missed out on a huge TSM play last year so I might just hold and see what happens.

Stop telling people my plan
And just think: you could have invested in bonds and high yield CDs like A RESPONSIBLE INVESTOR and you could have made the same amount in only 115 years *without all the risk!* If you sold your car and drove a beater 1993 Toyota Camry for the next 30 years, and also got an ugly, low maintenance wife, you could take like 20 years off of that! 

Heh. Bet you feel **pretty stupid** now don't you? Why don't you head on over to r/personalfinance and we'll tell you all about it.
I wouldn't feel confident to tell you tbh. But, I think "short interest" is a specific term with a different use of the word "interest" than my previous comment.
Yeah  good question. Are they?

We in this bitch
You.... bought covered calls?

Lol explain to me what that means.  

I have 1500 shares average 8.70 and plan to hold for a while.  Too many things going for BB and Chen to not take a position and ride until QNX starts taking off and impacting earnings reports.

Edit: and I thoroughly plan to continue building this position.  

Also, anyone who was expecting another massive day with no catalyst after 30%+ gains in a day is a retard hoping for only WSB to pump it.  This company has too large a float for that to happen while GME is the flavor of the month.

FUCK OFF BRO! China stocks need to be banned in this sub
Love BABA, own shares. When you take a look under the hood, they are very different. Not to mention, not taking a $200k expiring position on a company that's currently in the crosshairs of Chinese gov. Conversely, JD was chosen for CN Yuan digital currency test run with China's central bank. They are well liked by Xi.

Lastly, Liu Q fucks.

Seriously go fuck yourself. I was too retarded (or not retarded enough) to realize what options even were at this time. I bought shares in DEZ 19, because I was sure that they would explode and I now have a 720% return on them. If I understood trading and leverage better, I'd have done the same and instead of having 8000 Euros now, I'd be a millionaire.

Thanks again, but short term losses cannot be considered right?
So I’m definitely emptying my bank account on Tuesday
This is my first investment too. i put 6k in, which is almost all my money lol. Im super confident that its going to go up like no tomorrow but im pretty nervous still. Pressure creates diamonds 🙌💎💎💎 and im not selling until it hits $1000 🤑🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

so i basically just have to buy a $1500 call on Tesla and i can be like op? Thx dad
Nah I think this M&A is a bust, I doubt it happens.  Best time would have been Jan 4th.  Most biotechs merge early in the year.  Stock is still acting weird.  I'm giving it until March, but I'm doubtful.
Can you buy the stock in premarket if it looks like somethings popping?
Nope. Cup and handle pattern.

At it’s current price, it has a $4B market cap. A company like $QS has $20B market cap.

Imagine everyone’s face when they see Canoo made more in engineering services in 2020, than all the other EV SPACs, combined. 🤯

I'm on mobile, auto correct.
How does one deal with all of the red days leading up to a point like this? I know Tesla still has a lot of green days, but those red days and seeing your option go into the negatives would be tough over a whole year I would think. Were there any days that you thought the contracts would expire worthless?
Yikes bro and here I was hurting over my $100 loss. I'm just glad I didn't get tricked into buying on the dip. Let's hope come Tuesday we can at least sell on open for close to what we put in. I'm not holding it any longer if it goes neutral/green. Fuck it. Fool me once.
No I’m cash in Rh but I mean like 3 day trades in 5 day period or something like that
What’s the difference between Lowes and HD? HD hasn’t moved as much recently. 

I’m genuinely curious since where I grew up there was only a HD and not a Lowes. Are they as correlated as almost any two companies can be?

So should I buy cruise lines now?
No, he likely sold the contract, to a bigger investor or firm who will exercise the contract and buy the shares at the call price, the person who originally sold this contract was likely an MM who has been adding shares to cover this over time, they will make money on the shares they bought to cover early on and obviously lose money on the shares they bought later to cover the contract.   They lost money but not 3 million and they aren't paying him, he is being paid by somebody else who purchased the right to these shares from him.
I’m confusion
Tesla was still a meme back then. Remember Elon's "gonna take Tesla private at $420" tweet? In the 15 months preceding OPs so called bet, Tesla went from $250 to $370 to below $200. It still had crazy IV. No way he got the contracts for that price.
The day trade limit is because you're on margin with RH.
Norway national fund bought a few million shares like 2 weeks ago. A trillion dollar long term fund.

Cashing out: Set a limit order. 

Shorts might cover for lots of reasons: they have to buy the stock when they cover which drives up the stock price.

Trigger: If lots of shorts have to cover at the same time in the case of a margin call, it creates a positive feedback loop - and then you get new buyers jumping on. = high demand. 

Now here's the interesting part: GME doesn't have many shares in the float = low supply. 

If 1/3rd of the shorts wanted to cover, there simply would not be enough shares available = Price increase

Not sure what it will take for melvin to cover though.... They're pretty dug-in.

The other thing to do if buy Out of the money calls, so the MM headge

Funnily enough, I tried too. Before my post was removed, it received a lot of hate - which is happening again. It’ll be funny to look back in months to come.
when do we protest the Grand Exchange and force them to keep the markets open 24/7
The reason I said that is because the cats who are already on margin and can't cover have no way out but to sell those shares. I'm saying it's better to hold if that is the case.

I was inferring a solution to your problem and found it worse than your projected outcome. That is all. 

We in this together, baby.

Edit: I did use some fucking aggro language, my bad. I care about us getting these tendies as much as you do and that influenced my response.
monday will be flat broskittas
Might have been a few fake pumps, but mostly genuine. Too many tin foil hats around
My main one is 155c April. After earnings it was like 650%. Might be around 3-350% now. Don’t have E*TRADE open.
You should be banned for not pumping ARKK.

Why ARKK? I picked one at random and that's the one I put $1000 into.

Yeah GILD is a stupid fucking stock, it's actually been doing poorly for a really long time, and it's extremely undervalued.  Remdesivir pump was actually a high point for the last few years, but it immediately sank back around 58-60 right after.  If you ever have time, this guy's DD was actually pretty interesting.  It really does seem like someone is fucking with GILD, because the price hasn't budged (besides this summer) for many years.

Leaps can expire worthless, you can hold shares (and collect dividends) for eternity. 

Dividends might be a dirty word around here but it's nice when you're bag holding to get a little something for your trouble.

Actually, the exact opposite. Lost 250 on tesla and 500 by pussyhanding GME calls last week. Missed out on $3k if I had held both a few days later. But this week, APHA blew my account into the green. 

My All Time chart is showing a huge green boner on the right side
Any thoughts on how BB will do next week? Should I have sold my calls before EOD today?
Jesus Christ
Okay. fuck it. In in Tuesday!🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Can anyone explain why it kept dropping after that was in effect? Was it sell off?
Did I ever give the impression that I wasn't playing GME?  I started at $14 and still bought today.  It's a good play.

Lol you’re gonna have a LOT of fun trying to sell calls in this kinda market
I'm just telling you that if you're buying shares *on margin*, your *broker* can margin call you and force you to liquidate if you can't cover your margin. 

Imagine that you bought $30k of GME on margin but you only have $15k on hand. You get margin called, you either have to deposit an additional $15k so that you'll cover your positions or you sit there in disbelief as your broker liquidate your position because you got greedy. 

**Buy with money you have, not money you borrowed**

Otherwise, buy LEAPs that are far OTM because those are cheaper and force MM to delta hedge.

Companies can be hired to control a social presence. Yes.  Have you seen that video from Cramer on what hedge funds do?  It’s not illegal and if I was betting millions and was down you bet your ass I would be calling up these companies to shill this thread with bears and fake pump and dumps.


Definitely a conspiracy yes but also very likely imo.  Reddit has an API, I have used it but not for fucking pump and dump or some social media farm etc
🙁
I have shares avg price $25 on 5x leverage in eToro is this the same principle? Will I load up my account and yolo my entire bank to actually own the shares I have without using the leverage because I will if I have to. Or is what I’m doing different to margin?
Idk restaurants reopening news, revenue beats + just the plain surge of retail investors in a bull market, looking for a inexpensive "safe" dividend stock. This isnt accounting for the possibility of a "water security" international Black Swan event. Long term we may be underestimating bottled water and potable filtered water. Similar to the way we valued face masks in 2019.
Wut game
You can also do share replacement deep itm calls.
Lol yeah no doubt. I'm not sure what would happen expect the broker could get disciplined for it.
I have no idea, I think I read he said it was too risky at 20.
This is the reason you should have a target to dump your calls on the way up vs after it pulls back. If you sell otw up it will be worth more than the same level otw back down... in some cases quite a bit more if IV is super high and other factors contribute.
Just got done.
I'm in on the GME squeeze.  It's a good play.

I'm just saying that there's a lot of stupid shit going on in the daily threads that needs to either stop, or be moderated out, that's all.

apparently according to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ky4xmk/gme_shorts_havent_covered_theyve_added_only_added/) post the short interest actually increased.  
All we need to do is hold longer than the shorts. If we are able to we shall see tendies for everyone and their mothers.

buy gme
damn that's a sad story bro
Yeah... Worst case it dips and I hold with more ccs or sell with good return 🤷‍♂️
If they issue more stock then supply increases which will drive the price down over the short term as well as provide shares with which the shorters can cover their positions. If they do not issue shares then the brokerages will end up having to buy the shares at a premium just to close the positions.
Yea, but GME isnt
Oh ok that’s interesting. Yea I don’t know anything about biotech/healthcare. I just thought it was interesting since I was trying to see how many companies were lower than March lows and this, Walgreens, and Biogen came up and I just recalled back in the day when Remdesivir was talked about a lot here. 

Good luck on your play.

  🌈🐻 Hedge funds chicken tendies bandits need to go, its just evolution  🌈🐻
This post is so sick. I appreciate this post and will love to see your future DDs. Great post :)
Word on the street is that some were getting in causing the recent run up. That would explain the price increase while SI increased with it. No way WSB produced that kinda volume.
Anyone else have their best week of trading last week and worst this week?
This is teh way
I was playing anyways.
I’m not buying in until it hits 100 :)
Most countries are moving towards clean sustainable energy, mostly solar, wind and hydro. But in order to provide enough electricity during dips (less wind/sunlight) there is a need for a power source that can be turned on when desired.

In 2017 coal, oil and gas account for 64% of global electricity generation, which are bad for the environment but helps countries to stabilize the supply. Enter nuclear.

Nuclear energy is scary to alot of people because of the recent Fukushima disaster and Tsjernobyl still being in the back of their minds. Designs of reactors has changed to prevent Tsjernobyl-like accidents and the death toll of Fukushima because of radiation was 0.

Until we get to a point where nuclear fusion becomes viable (I don't expect this to happen within 25 years), nuclear fission reactors are the only way to go from here. China is fully onboard and it won't be long until other countries see that this is the way.

Personally I bought shares in Encore Energy (uranium mining) 2 weeks ago and am still looking around for some good long-term uranium investments. Im looking also at companies who either do milling, enriching, selling enrichment centrifuges or build nuclear power plants.
only shares to buy are GME

Probably a move to get retail shorts to close their positions, some investing pages encouraged, as recently as this time last month (looking at you Matt Stewart), encouraged retail investors to engage in Naked Short selling of GME, absolutely terrible advice, anyone who took it is in an absolute world of hurt right now.

Hmmm once I’m done with my 100’s of %  gains on TSM, that might be something to look into. Been a little bit since I’ve actually looked for a foot few month play.
I’m down 10% with 50 shares at an avg of $10.53. This gives me hope.

Hi,   
Could you explain splashing the bid means?  
Is it just short selling a shit ton of shares using market orders ?

all in on gme with margin. prolly a dumb idea but sure as hell not boring
Real true europoor autist here: does margin = leverage? If yes, then fuck. Should I close the leveraged position and open a simple buy one so we can squeeze the living shit out of Melvin?

There is a theory being pushed by some guy that GILD is being manipulated down so another pharma can buy them.  [https://www.griproom.com/fun/it-looks-like-gilead-is-about-to-merge-with-roche](https://www.griproom.com/fun/it-looks-like-gilead-is-about-to-merge-with-roche)

I took out a small options stake based on this DD but it looks to be not the case.  I'm not going to close my position, I'll take the loss since my options expire in March and GME made me a lot of money.  Would be nice since I'd probably make 30k based on this DD if it's true.  Again, seems very unlikely.
Depends what you mean, but the company seems to have a lot of potential
Uh...it dropped from $370 after Elons "gonna take it private at $420" tweet to under $200 in only 7 months. It was still one of the most volatile stocks out there back then.

if stonks stay flat, your leaps get fuk
BB was pumped by a company Melvin hired to get us off GME. Hedge fund fuckery. That’s my opinion but was ducking weird when I came Thursday night and Friday morning to shill accounts that haven’t commented pumping it here and all over stock twits.
From a shareholder perspective it's perfectly ethical. And from GME perspective issuing stock while the public is fighting to buy it and shorts have reached 125% volume sounds like a good way to **raise** the stock price and fuck the shorters.

But just because he's an ally at this time doesn't mean he's a permanent ally and that will go over all us retards heads

I think you can deduct $3K in net losses and then roll the rest into the following years to offset future gains.

Get a legit accountant though. Some will pretend to listen and just do the standard deduction.

just look at current prices for options.

tsla at 875,  mar 2023 call strike 1500 , premium is around $250. (15%) of the strike price with its current vol.

so just see what the volatility was back then compared to now.
Buy shares, options too expensive right now
He had one that he deleted that was a roller coaster warning and said something like keep your hands and feet in it's going to be a bumpy ride.  He warned his shareholders (pretty obvious that those are the only people commenting on his tweets) about how volatile and scary this was going to be but to just stick it out with him.
PLTR will happen i believe
Haha 😂 What was your comment?
You what's odd. Back when I was in school I thought everyday why the hell do I have to go in person-- I wish I could be remote. This back when dial up ruled the land. Hated waking up at 6, and walking 3/4 a mile to school while the rich kids got driven in their mercedes with a fully packed lunch.

I remember kids who got suspended cheering when their suspension was out of school as opposed to in school so they could stay home all day and watch cable tv lol.

Thanks. I'm going to assume this imposes certain aspects I would otherwise not be okay with like buying on a different exchange and dealing with commissions correct?
I forgot to mention, options that are exercised are converted into shares. 10 contracts at 100 is 1000 dollars for 10 shares. If the shares go OVER 100, you paid a discount, which is where the profit is calculated.

See my other reply to the other poster in this thread. But if you are wondering why you can only carry over 3000, it’s a rule.

Or just Google 3k carryover rule for stocks for other links. It’s just a rule. I don’t why why it’s the rule at that number, but I guess it makes you not be as big of a degenerate gambler.

Nobody spamming GME is advocating for everyone else in the sub to talk to their dads and get whatever info they can about their respective companies and spread it around WSB.  GME deserves to be spammed because it's a legit good play.

Uprising does not mean winning.  Uprising means that there's more of something than there was before.  All of the institutions are paying attention to the recent injections of new and uneducated investor cash, and I can promise you they're working on ways to take it from us.

It's a dumb fucking analogy, but it will literally be like taking candy from a baby once they figure out how to either bully retail in the market, or use their billions to legislate us out of existence.  

Tread with caution is all I'm saying, and to the newbies with $100 in RH, just please, for the love of god keep quiet until you know what's going on.
Yesss! This is the sort of information I’m looking for, thanks OP!

You guys think AOC would step on me if I payed her $20? 🤔
Go into the settings and disable margin.
No it’s the excess of 3000. 

So if you lost 5000, you can deduct 3000 and 2000 carry over. If you lost 100k, you can deduct 3000 and 97k carry over. 

However the carryover loss can be then offset by gains next year. So say you lost 5k this year, you deduct 3k and carry over 2k. But you make 2k next year. So next year then you just make a net 0 and you have no more carryover but also don’t have to pay the tax the year you made 2k.
Well, that’s because a good portion of the people on here are trading options. Options are like saying “I think gme will go to 45 by end of week” and putting money down on that “play” like a bet. Since they don’t expire until that timeframe, you can sell them before they expire for more or less than you bought them for depending on how the chart looks compared to where you want to go. If it doesn’t hit 45, it goes to 0 dollars, all the money is gone. But if it hits 45, you win, and the option is “exercised”. Sometimes you have to do this part yourself. When you exercise a call that is in the money, you get paid. This is where big math happens. Let’s say you bought 10 contracts at 100 on stockx for end of month. You can only lose 1000 dollars, but depending on how far over the price target the stock goes, you get paid out, theoretically possible, any amount of money between 1000 and like a million dollars lol. Profit on these is no limit. Anyways, if you don’t have diamond hands or you think the stock will dip a little and you want to max out locked in gains, you sell the contract at a profit.

You buy shares with your long money, money you don’t want to lose.

But if you want to have fun losing money until you get lucky and make a couple hundred thousand like the big kids in here, you spend the money you would usually gamble, drink, or smoke on options.

They can require current margin holders to exercise or add more capital to their account to meet the new requirements (70% or 100% of the margin or whatever) or they will close out your position. That's why you shouldn't be buying GME on margin.

Not being able to expand easily doesn't mean your moat is easy to break into. Name a direct competitor to Steam. Epic? The only reason anyone gives a shit about Epic is that they give you a free game every single day and spend insane amounts on exclusives.

Steam earned a total of \~**4.3 Billion back in 2017** ***without accounting for DLC/MTX (the biggest cash cows by far)*****.** Their margins are unreal, and they have no real liabilities or capex. Let me give you an example;

Right now people are buying dividend ETFs that come out to about a 1.75% yield. So you spend $100 for a $1.75 payout every year.

Assuming Steam IPOs and hands out 80% of their profit (assuming 80% margins on sales - completely fair for a developed software/server-only company that does almost nothing). Using the 2017 sales: 4.3 Billion \* .8 \* .8 = **Annual dividend payments of 2.752 Billion.**

Under those assumptions, if people bought Steam until it was at a 1.75% yield too, it would be worth **157 Billion**. There's a reason literally people are spending insane amounts of money trying to dethrone them - the ROI is incredible.

That’s how Trump avoids taxes. The companies that register a loss are companies that he uses. Like imagine having your own bar that you like to drink at.  The bar registers a loss so you get a tax deduction even though you were drinking there every weekend with your pals.

Shorts could have gotten out at 25, 30, etc and new short interest at the new high of 40.

Those new shorts could make bank if the stock pops back down.

He has the right to buy 5000 shares of TSLA at $138.  TSLA is currently at $823.  He can sell those options to a market maker or some institution that would love to exercise those options for a profit.  The price they pay him for those contracts is $3.4M.

You could try. It is actually a good idea, Have batches with varying trailing limits. Sort of do a exponential or a normal dist. of the amount you sell at the sell trailing limits. I dont know if how anybody else does it but this is me just experimenting.  
Ex :   
100 shares with trailing limits of :in the normal curve case:  
5 shares - 2.5%  
10 shares - 4.5%  
20 shares - 5.5%  
30 shares - 6.5%  
20 shares -  7.5%  
10 shares -  8%  
5 shares - 8.5%  
An exponential increase in shares sold might be better maybe? I dont know.

I am thinking aloud and this might be too complicated.

I would’ve definitely gotten a $690,000 loan in that case. Could easily make back that money selling far weekly OTM calls rather than having to pay huge taxes at once on those gains. He could’ve even decided to sell same day expiration calls for $500 and still make over mil before taxes.

Buying on margin just means you're borrowing money for your trades. Those shares you bought aren't actually yours.
 
Think of it roughly as the other side of short selling, which is selling shares you don't own.
Yes, you spend a huge amount of time sitting around in the car and so its a fabulous space in which to build out an ecosystem. Especially when self drive becomes reality and folks are just sitting there. Every OEM and fleet owning business is interested in the data coming out of their cars for a million different purposes.  All modern cars use collect data from sensors, but its all proprietary, manufacturer/model specific, not secure and non-standardized.

BB and Amazon are developing a secure, standardized platform that will work across all automobiles make and models. The universality of it will attract third party developers since they can develop an app for all cars, not just a 2024 Toyota Camry.  They can make money. Manufacturers will use it because they will be getting a secure system that will work across makes and models of their own cars, with amazon cloud behind it....WAY more efficient than doing it inhouse.

Competitors are WAY behind on size and security. They have a terrific moat.   And every car company that has QNX is positioning for this future. This is close to a  sure thing.

Buy 1 share for fun
You have 55 shares and I only have 5. I bought 20 shares of BB instead of calls and cucked myself. Now I have no profit tendies to YOLO GME on
At that price, that puts the company at a market cap of 20 billion, which doesn't seem unreasonable.   


If you look at the blue apron short squeeze, the price went over 14x. Say if GME drops down to $30 and then 14x, that brings us to 420... soo no unreasonable.  


420.69 is fun also because if the price peaks there, we know we did it.

yea the contract he bought from those calls would be worth 0 dollars. I just want to stress this out he was super lucky. This play is literally a 98 percent chance of loosing all your money . Very high risk.

Also cmon who gonna predict a company stock will go from 62 dollars to 826 dollars in the span of a year. Thats insane growth.

You should take the work "again" out of the title.  Everyone here knows that Citi downgraded on the 14th.  You're making people think that it happened again yesterday or today.
Put all your gains in an escrow account with intent to buy property. Then buy a property with all the money. Now pay property taxes only which is a lot less

Yea long term losses net first then short term losses so you’ll have a 4000 total loss, 3000 of which can be applied as a deduction against income and 1000 carried over to the following year.

Why would you do such a thing?
Drilling? Maybe in the day to day volatility. Looking at the 1week or 1month chart. It's the fact that we're still at this support level means it's not over yet. It always swung 10-20%
This was an accident? The 69/420 was a coincidence? 

This is shocking. You roll two 1,000-sided die, and I think it's 500,000-to-1 against a 69/420. I was convinced it was intentional. Now it feels like anything could happen.
So wait, at that time, the price was about $50 (post-split), so $250 pre-split, and you paid $150 for a single $690 1/15/21 call? That is... super fucking cheap.

To be honest, I’m surprised that option existed. I wonder what the highest strike was at the time.

Dude Tesla ATH was like $375 at that point and the actual price was around $240ish when he bought (all pre split) 

A $600+ call was still a 3x gain away with low IV, they were cheap as fuck.

I am out of the loop here, is this a coordinated attack on Melvin Capital stocks using GameStop?
It doesn't make sense that a sell limit would prevent a share from being lent. Shares can be recalled at any time without warning. If you have a sell limit get hit, the broker recalls your shorted share, sells it, and pays you, at minimum, the sell limit you set.

You can start a thread about that... probably should put it a bit higher to lessen the risk of front-running though

You are obviously new to this sub because not even two months ago if you spoke bad about trump you were downvoted to hell by the sub because they all praised him every day just about. Get your head out of your boyfriends ass bud and realize you made a mistake it’s not going to end up your shit existence of a life.

Come back Mac Miller
This is going to get downvoted because of the hive mind here, but I’m willing hear any bull or bear case out.

Facts we know so far:
- Short interest is still at >130index
- Last week’s rally was due to boomer/Cramerheads jumping in

GME Bull here. Though constructively a short squeeze case makes sense on paper, I still hold reservations because:

1. We don’t know how deep Melvins pockets are, presumably deeper than we can imagine.

2. Like you’ve rightfully pointed out, 2ply toilet paper hand retailers (evidently from the sudden influx of dumbass questions that unlike past months, are now asked unironically) who’ve downloaded robinhood in the past 72 hours with full margin exiting at the slightest gap down.

Culmination of factors 1 and 2 will create so liquidity to exchange hands, favouring the shorts. The most logical scenario would be slow and persistent squeeze with improved fundamentals with the e-commerce turnaround.
Absolutely, and it’s still not too late man! Join the cult! uh, I mean club!
Coke is a soft drug
First, KO pays dividends so it’ll need to go up a few more dollars above that strike dividend-adjusted. 

Second, what makes you think KO will go up 25 dollars in 2 years? It’s only 48.70 dollars now so that’s a roughly 50%+ move in 2 years. That would actually be historic if it does that. Your best bet is just some short term 50% swing on those, never hold that.

If you are interested in that type of trade though, T might offer even “better” value, in quotes of course.

Wouldn’t the broker just not give a fuck and market buy, filling as many orders as it takes to settle the short position regardless of limit price? After all its not their money they are spending to close the position, if they need to liquidate someones assets in order to get them to settle up they will without hesitation

I dont use Robinhood so I may be misunderstanding how they function

Can the mods pin a GME post already for these paper hand pussies

Im balls deep in GME and I dont know shit, except I trust WSB and this can be historical 

We as retards need to be GUIDED what is our plan, we cant have people selling out at the first glimpse of gains. What are we doing?!?!
Also shares bought on margin can get lent out again.

Or, basically, buying on margin can't trigger a squeeze.  Only buying in cash accounts can.
Fun fact about financial reporting. It’s only a snapshot of their holdings at the quarter end. Doesn’t tell you what they are vested in throughout:) anyways yeah banks are solid af but taxes are going to kill their returns. That and with how the economy is going commercial & consumer lending is pretty much falling off a cliff. That’s why they sold off. They had a good quarter because of trading and IB work. That stuff is cyclical and doesn’t reflect how the business is truly doing.
I can’t bring myself to say it out loud
😂
I know!
Tons of people on RH get rich off of selling the top on other stocks. The platform isn’t perfect, but it’s made a lot of us rich already.

I was looking into GoPro as well but curious to see why you made 4/16 15C call? 

GoPro trades sideways right now and not much action. But things could change when GoPro gets into the drone industry (I thought they were, could be wrong) OR they get acquired, gets upgrade, or someone like ARK invests. 

Do you have a DD you made in a pdf format or something by any chance? I'm glad I came across this one.

you as well friend
Insane how he held through and also Insane to imagine that if you had put the same amount which he did (50k) on calls Monday before Gme shot up 90%, you'd have exactly the same gains he did holding over a year in one day
u did. sell and buy at 48-50 range

The order was to open the position, not close it. He’d owe 340,000.


*Edit: I suck at math apparently
Bought 420 shares Wednesday.  Holding
What midway said. If the numbers are true they'll have to buy all shares twice over to cover. If we don't sell til $3000 they won't be able to not buy at that price. People memeing 420.69 are aiming too low. But people will paper hand and sell too low and not fuck Melvin hard enough
Honestly if there's a squeeze to $100, this sub would still be burned by buying the top. It's what this sub excels at.
Ryan Cohen is not dumb. He wouldn’t spend millions on GME if he doesn’t think he can’t turn it around. GME is pivoting to e-commerce. They have 3 great things going for them that will make it a successful pivot: a brand name + customer data + a leader who knows the e-commerce game. Game related customer data is important and GME has more of that than anyone else.

Many great companies turn around right before the verge of bankruptcy, to name a few: Apple, Tesla.

One great leader can change the game. Apple went from almost bankruptcy to one of the most valuable companies in the world. Ryan Cohen is no Steve Job but he understands e-commerce.
Flattest day ever
The move would be to convince local city planners to let you rezone your lot/lots so you could turn it into a full on resort/theme park. Manage it yourself and cut out the middle man.
You don’t cash out. You let it grow, you only cash a portion of it to buy short term Tesla calls

Can’t believe how fast ☄️☄️☄️ caught on.
It's good for the squeeze atleast
you may not be able to get out at a good price during the squeeze Robin Hood and they screw you and you won't get filled until it's too late I kind of doubt that but it's certainly possible
There’s always a dip. Always.

Take the 400% and wait. Don’t be a greedy fuck. Remember, the 400% takes certain folks a year to earn.

It wasn’t a squeeze. It was pinning the market at certain levels so the most calls and puts expired worthless and reducing gamma exposure
Because yoga classes are so hot now -.-
It’s like 2am here, nothing was open :/
Up 100% this month but all I can think about is the 50% I lost from the top.
Actually, yes.
Hehe I gotcha. Thank you boss!

No taxes on loses. 😎
I’ve been doing covered calls on UVXY ever since it hit $11. IV is insane on the options. Super easy money.
you only get taxed on gains tho
We want to go to tendie town, the moon, 🚀 in reality the vision for GME is huge besides the meme and I want this short fucking squeeze to be historic

Anything else retard?
This man's going places.
Wow makes us look like intellectuals learning strategies and shit.
All this talk of GME....lot of tesla calls wiped out...lotta brothers silenced...gamestop went to the moon while tesla burned...
Didnt you have anything else or uber eat? Or dash? Put on your rectum.
GME isn’t done idiot but I do agree on SPCE
Just dollar cost then, take some incrementally but just know it is limiting the max
This is a great read. But honestly GME won’t be as a big of a squeeze as VW  was because some will paper hand.
Either way it will be huge 🚀🚀
I need numbers to go up or down. When numbers don't go up or down on day I get sad :(
You guys keep asking what the gme price target is
 That literally depends on If we hold the shares.

If we all collectively agree to set a limit order at 420$, then that's the PT

Commas for everything else in the screenshot. theres even commas in the title. Never seen it without commas. Besides, this guy has zero previous posts on wsb despite having an account age of 5 months, gives no dd despite massive gains and diamond hands, never bothered to post unrealised gains, completely anonymous and no verifiable proof that the trade even occured, the post is shorter than my dick and the rules specifically prohibit percentage gain screenshots because they are so easy to fake. Hell, i could make this shit in excel in 5 minutes.

Probably not the best place to ask, since this is a casino, but I am genuinely curious- what time granularity charts are TA people looking at when they see bull flags, triangles, little dipper, free willy etc. I'm convinced you can find any pattern you want in any given chart if you look at any candles smaller than 1 day.
I have to read?!?! How about a youtube video explaining it, I'm an autist...
Exactly.
NOW yes. The ENTIRE options premium market is higher ever since 2020 reared its head. This post isn't bs, you are just salty.
No sleep 'til $420.69, boys!
And that is very well the case, but it's a bunch of guys taking out covered calls on GME after a 100%+ run-up, then it's ambiguous as to the way playing this options strategy works.
Those people fucked us 😆

It showed a huge amount of naked shorts on tilray, but normal short interest is much smaller.

this squeeze can take months up to a year to happen. this squeeze has been being talked up for months on end. it doesn’t matter when you get in, how much, etc. 

as long as you have shares when the squeeze happens, you’re making BANK. 

you’re the closest to the squeeze we have been. a man literally diamond handed millions of dollars in GME when it was plummeting and didn’t budge. the market is meant to have money put in and let magic happen. 

just give it some time man, it’ll all work out. i’ll reply with a DD that’ll give you hope

Makes sense. But in that case you are highlighting a potential risk over the next week or two, not supporting the reverse thesis. If the price starts falling enough to make people panic, then yes, that could indeed cause a break down in the otherwise impending short squeeze

If they do it after you say no that means they dont give a shit about your boundaries. This is more usual w young assholes but after 30 people really pick up on this. Learn that its ok to say

No i dont want

No i dont like

No i cant

Key for me - to say this when on the fence but u feel like “ehhh maybe”. I said it recently to a chick that i kind of wanted to fuck but wasnt sure i wanted to put up w her. She was hounding me to party that night and i said “no i dont want. “ and it dropped the weight off my shoulders instantly and made me feel better about myself. U get clarity and self respect saying no. 


Also theres a saying “”no” is a complete sentence”
What was the strike at time of purchase? Or is that pre split price adjusted?
😂😂😂

Fair. I’m guilty of buying GME shares with margin myself, cept I started the liquidation process already. Wanted to divest from margin anyway and I pretty much only have strong convictions on GME, PLTR and ICLN at this point so I felt okay could selling off some other holdings.


PLUS. With the tendies we’re about to come into, I can just buy those equities all back if I wanted. WCGW???

You are aware that their rolling of shorts forward isn't some small loss right? They would've had to drag those shorts across all that price difference with all those premiums at increasingly higher rates and volumes just to set themselves up now with humongous lending rates and a short position many times larger? Your point on margin calls is not complete bullshit, but brokers also trade with each other so those margins coming up will affect us but are also indicative of similar measures being taken at higher levels. Margin at the retail level approaching 90 means its rising as well for the big boys. And in your grizzly, homosexual ways, you've forgotten that the entire thesis is based on the idea that we can hold on at almost not cost in the short term with RC also giving us an out in the long if we need it. Now go back to your cereal subs and discuss that instead of shilling in our ranks.

You have to decide on how to enforce your boundaries - you aren't following through and that's why people are doing shit anyways. Enforcing boundaries = you change your behavior. So if someone is really rude to you, an example of a boundary is to walk away if they start name calling. They can't violate your boundaries because you are gone.

You realize many of you are going to be bagholding GME shares right? You will buy during the squeeze at a post turnaround valuation and have too wait for Cohen to actually fulfill all the stuff to breakeven.

In fact im gonna make a meme. It will be darth vader labeled 'GME autists' waking up, and then palpatine will be labeled 'deepfuckingvalue' and then the text will say. "What is gamestop at, did we moon? Is it 100?" And then the emperor is like 'it seems in your FOMO, you bought at the top' and then 'I bought the top? I couldn't have. I felt it was going to moon, NOOOOOOOO'

When did you buy these ?
Some brokerages are requiring 100% margin requirement specifically for GME stock. That means if you put $40k in GME shares on margin, you must have an additional 40k of margin in your account for them to hold.
I was already in a concentration requirement with GME. Margin requirement of 80%. I can always liquidate some ICLN or CHWY leaps to cover that.

I dont. I bought shares for long term. Not sure what these kids want. But fb settlement news and this conference apparently was hype. But tbh all that happened is bb went on the radar by selling patents recently and people went “huh its alive?” And wsb helped raise the price so its across traders radar. I expect it holds 9 and then keeps going as more people buy it for long term play

It wasn't.

You're seeing the POST SPLIT costs.

 [https://imgur.com/gallery/eq3bK00](https://imgur.com/gallery/eq3bK00) 

On 10/24/2019 TSLA was around $300 (H:304.45 L:285.75)OP bought 10 of 1/2021 $690 CALL for $1.65 (\~this is approximate but H:1.84, L:1.45)

so total cost was about $165\*10 = $1650.00

Then the split happened so his 10 options became 50 and the $690 Strike became $138

TSLA ended to day at $826.16 but had a high of $859.90

so he made (($721.9\*100)\*50) = $72,190\*50 = $3,609,500 which is roughly what he made.

AUGH!!!!!!!

Now if you're thinking of trying this, the IV on the Jan & Mar 2022 options are Freaking HIGH!
ok.. what would you recommend then?

This ^. I've found it always best to buy options at EOD. Got some March 15 calls for 1.02 at 3:07 and they closed the day out at 1.22 up a couple grand already. Timing your by ins can net you a lot of profit. I've made so many bad plays ahaha. To the moon brother!!

I'm well aware of the chart, and all the reasons people give for the infinite squeeze. My brain understands the logic, but my mind's eye can't see 250-1000/share as a reasonable outcome. Don't get me wrong--I'm jacked to the tits. 100% of my brokerage AND my IRA accounts are fully in GME @ 2950 shares. Hell, might throw another 5-10k at it on Tuesday depending on what's happening and how I'm feeling. I'm here, I'm with you. Just hard to process that as a true potentiality.

No it didn't porsche and government contracts already owned 94%ish of the stocks before the announcement was even made and at the time it was being shorted. Obviously they weren't going to sell their shares and so the shorters lost big. As long as gme shareholders all hold it's the same concept and we literally can't fail.

Here’s the thing. Interest rates are TINY right now for general margin.  Like a 2%. 
For short selling GME, the interest rate has been north of 33%.  


One of those rates is going to kill you.  The other you won’t notice.
Boundaries are usually implied and adhered to

Vocally setting boundaries usually never works because the person won’t follow it.
Retards [like this](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxw4hu/dont_relent_now_boys_i_just_bought_1000_on_margin/) probably can't.

Buying on margin without the funds to cover could potentially fuck the short squeeze

I tossed a casual 500 limit sell this evening. It's my hopes n goals for my 55 stock, but I'll adjust in premarket Tuesday. I expect it to break 100 at a minimum. Check out the VW short squeeze. It was a different scenario but you can see the effect of a squeeze on shorts. It skyrockets 500% in a day.

I'll honestly run a spread of sell limits to make sure I can cover my initial investment, so starting at 150+ up to 500. But again, dependent on what happens this weekend. 3 days is a lot for investors to think on and for bomb she'll news to drop.

I was thinking though, you know how we shit on GME for selling you a $60 game and buying it back for $0.75 before reselling for $50? Well the last time I checked you can't just mail Jeff Bezos a used video game for anything. Best Buy doesn't. Target, Walmart, nobody. They might give you pennies but it's better than nothing, and they resell tons. If they do it efficiently at good locations, they could be a real cash cow.

Market makers don't have to locate shares in order to short a stock. They're harder to squeeze. They have to be engaged in bona fide market making activity, though.
Patently false.
Sell 25 % when it's over 400% gain so you have nothing in the trade.

Lose fucking hope??? 

Down 10% after being up 100% for the week? And you’re losing hope?

Today was a good day. 

Melvin in panicking. All the shorts are panicking. 

It’s not just WSB anymore. There are Hedge funds that are bullish on this now too.

Nah he ain’t selling either. I just watched 2.5 hours of his last live stream from Wednesday. The man’s been holding GME for almost a year, his interest to see where this can fully go has been piqued. 


If he did sell, sure  that would be demoralizing but like you said the man’s set. In terms of the rest of us, there was a bunch of insider selling this week from 4 board members all of whom own more shares than DFV and the price is STILL in mid 30s

If Steam was to IPO the fair value would unironically be about \~100 billion dollars my man. They're the dominant market leader in one of the fastest growing industries on earth.

The only discussion GameStop has had about Steam is discussing how they can meaningfully differentiate themselves from what Steam is offering, because Steam is exactly where they want to be and has a seemingly impenetrable moat.
#Do not buy GME shares on margin - here's why:

If "Fidelity and Schwab are confirmed to have eliminated margin" it means all the traders that bought on margin will get a margin call and be **forced** to liquidate their positions or add more funds. 

That means the 100,000 shares you bought on margin are going to be forcibly liquidated when you can't cover the actual cost of getting them. This will force prices *down*.

**If you're buying GME shares, you want to buy with cash *on hand* and nothing more**

Alternatively, buy LEAPs with as high strike as possible - follow u/deepfuckingvalue and hop on mid-April calls

GME is not allowed to take on new debt. If they can’t start reducing their debt, they will need to sell stock. It will drop when that happens. Shorts win.

Great observations
When will this sub realise that institutional investors don't get margin called on tiny positions like their GameStop shorts like us autists with small portfolios? Day to day movements in their gargantuan positions in other stocks outweigh any impact on margin that even massive movement in gme has. They don't get margin called on a small cap like this.
Companies acquiring businesses that are more successful than them? That’s pretty much 99% of every purchase. Why the fuck would you buy a business that’s worse than yours?

PLTR will go up SO MUCH when the lockup period will come, almost no employee will sell:

Go and have a look at employee's comments on Glassdoor.

The most frequent positive/negative comment is that they're fanatics about the company.
Who is gonna sell if they haven't any plan to leave the company in the next 5 years... NO ONE, obliviously the company will have an higher valuation by that time.

When the uncertainty of the lockup will be gone PLTR will 🚀🚀🚀 even more than after than presentation.

Personal expectation: 35-40$ after presentation and 60$+ after lockup.

Holding 1193 shares and probably adding some more next week if the price doesn't go too high.

So I gotta ask...could we be holding out for GME to squeeze in months or years? Or could this go down end of the month or V-day?...any idea the potential timeframe?

Every big tech stock except Tesla and surprisingly Google is lower than late August levels. Salesforce and Amazon just stuck in a range forever. Salesforce even worse off since the Slack buy was a terrible idea.

Nvidia and Microsoft have done nothing wrong and have really had no bad news and only good earnings and both have not moved either. Facebook might be the only one where I can give an explanation of why it’s been tanking.

Nope she showed up and we boned later so it turned out great, I kind of fucked up the dish though, needed more seasoning.

Yeah I only bought because of your DD hahaha. I didnt get in as early as you sadly but I cannot be upset with a 70% ROI. 

I think only AMD I had a higher return at 250%, but didnt have large enough cashpiles to go ham at that time.

Now I gamble 80% of each paycheck on stonks that have a DD and aren't memed yet lol. Thanks mate, hope to see you on the moon. 🚀

I lost lot of money last year, so money has just become a number to me. I am not scared anyway. Just scared of getting old and broke. 

Interest eats a lot of money but in a bull or crazy ass market the benefits are better than risks.

I am usually cutting down other expenses to fund this interest so it might work out.

The guy who bought Bed Bath cause of all the BB chatter, LOL amazing.
OP has the right to buy 5000 shares at $138 and can sell them for the current market value (~$823). That’s a profit of ~$685/share. 5000*685 = $3.425 million. Subtract from that the original price he paid for the options (~$1,500) and that’s his net gain.

Eh personally I don’t believe the Fed has the omnipotence people claim, but they are powerful. My thesis is that they interest rates are 0, we aren’t coming up for a while and the economy will continue to deflate from all that debt. The Fed, frustrated that the patient isn’t responding will then expand into other areas like yield curve control and subsidizing massive Dem spending.

But none of that means markets are smooth sailing until 2023.
how is a TSLA leap only 0.31 even in Oct 2019? TSLA wasn't that cheap back then
If the company is going to crush it's earnings report why do "we" have to buy for anything to happen? Your pitch falls somewhere between sideshow barker and snake oil salesman with a soupcon of pederast..
Genomics is the future but still early stages.  We don’t like getting early, we prefer getting into GME at $42.
Hm. You’ve definitely given me something to think about. Shares or Jan 23’ LEAPS could be interesting, especially since you could slash down your cost basis a lot in a year by selling CCs.

These things squeeze quit quickly no? I’ve never been through a short squeeze before but couldn’t it just go up to $60 quickly (minutes) and then start falling back down if everyone is selling? Do you anticipate it getting well over $100 for a meaningful amount of time?

Yeah you’ll potentially make some money.  The reason people aren’t advocating options is they don’t help squeeze the shorts.   So in this case the way you trade actually interrelates to the investment thesis.   

I haven’t followed options as much in a short squeeze and what they’ll do.

Do you seriously expect someone to give you extremely valuable information that puts both of you at risk of being accused of insider trading for free? Hey, you might as well ask people to Venmo you 2000 bucks, see how that works. F
Basically.  The market maker facilitated this transaction. (a market maker is a firm that wants to profit off the bid-ask spread and provides liquidity for the security)

In this case, they would absolutely love to buy a deep ITM call and exercise it for a profit.  It looks like close to 700k is what they pocketed depending on what time this was executed today.

It’s just a risk equation for brokers. They are lending you money to invest into securities. Brokerages are going to be more cautious lending you funds when the underlying asset is riskier, and this is mostly measured with volatility. I’m simplifying of course, but I would avoid thinking of it as a conspiracy. It’s just not good business on their end to extend full leverage to stocks with a large amount of volatility, or other risks. They are trying to avoid the risk of the account going unsecured, i.e. you have a negative account value and owe them money. Which is then a headache for them to try and get you to pay back. Margin is a loan, plain and simple, and when the asset is deemed risky they are going to require you to make more of a “down payment” if you will. Of course this is a slam dunk, free money bet, GME to the fucking moon, next stop $420.69, 🚀🚀🚀, but they don’t realize that yet.
I can guarantee you, that I'm not a financial advisor or any representative of any financial firms.

Cramer says apple is a buy. It's $126 right now... PT is $155

When people short a stock, but the price goes up so much that the shorts freak out and "sell" (which is actually buying to cover their short at a higher price) and then this sends the price even higher, freaking out more shorts, and it's a chain reaction that snowballs.

All you muppets that are leveraged to hills on margin are doing us all a disservice as your shares can be lent out for more shorts. When you guys get forced to sell for a loss only to see the price spike a few days later. You only have yourself to blame for being greedy.

Nothing you're saying is unreasonable--we all make our bets. I hope we both make money. <3
Are you fucking kidding me dude..
I think there might be another pullback soon, we already are in a Low vol environment, should help their markets arm.

With that said, I expect their bad debt provisions to continue ballooning. The next 1-2 years will be exciting
If none of us sells then how could this happen? I don’t follow that part
Yes, but heavily shorted which will probably continue next session. Once they start to cover it'll get quick momentum because it's cheap, good p/e, and everyone is watching it

No idea about GME posts being deleted but I think you will find a lot of people were eyeing BB but it only became popular over the last few days because of the large price movement.
💯.
What are the actual modalities by which we couldn't see the infinity squeeze at this point - besides a massive retail paper hand dump? Clearly the price will hit $69.69. I want $420.69.

No no no. You can sell the call option. If you’ve held it for over a year, that’s long term cap gain. That’s a big deal. If you exercise you reset the holding period.
Yep. Robinhood exists, time for the stock market to go to 0. Its been fun.

I may sound like a boomer but if ur actually gonna get a vehicle get a used one. New ones depreciate like crazy.
Don’t forget that in the VW case the short interest was only around 30%. Since Porsche owned 72% and some institutions owned some that means about 130-150% of the liquid float was shorted. GameStop about 160% of the liquid float is shorted. Very comparable
I thin in my position, with options I bought Thursday expiring Friday, its best to sell at the pop, no? I see people saying to buy the shares if I can cover the cost. Which is also interesting, but profit wise, Its better to sell, and buy far out contracts instead on any dip. Thoughts?
Thanks dad, love you
I gotta whole week to fk with my money before jumping on the Amazon train. Earnings is in Feb I plan on getting in last week of Jan. Incase of more red days.
Expecting a nice bounce back from the clean energy stonks on Tuesday, today’s sell off was pretty excessive
bank stocks have been shit for a while and the market has been fine, and trust me the banks themselves are more than okay, they have rock-solid balance sheets, they're not balls deep in speculative assets like in 2008.

On Wednesday I just got an email and message suddenly. I was suprised, I called fidelity and they gave me time till 1.00 PM. If you don't call they usually sell by 10.00 AM.  

Fidelity emails before selling, you can look at my second screenshot. Also they sell when there are set house calls dates on the margin account.
The sell off this past week is faker than Kim kardashians ass. SPY 400
Dude if that happens, I just might. I really want this to hit, I want this meme stock to be historical

I know right pick something else to pump... 
That shit already happened.
Yeah I hear you, the earnings came from non sustainable items ie trading due to election vol, their Q1 earnings might be on the weaker side given we’re entering a low vol environment
My guess is because until recently they still believe it goes to 0.  Still seems dumb AF to try and squeeze $3 out of an already dead stock tho lol

Don't play calls. But shares. IV will crush you. It's too hot now.
I also use Fidelity and my GME margin percentage rose to 75%. Not sure why there is a difference. Because of this week’s rise, this will hurt retail GME shorts more than longs.
Too low. Make it 1000
Get what you feel good with. Personally I currently believe in the mid-long game here. I have shares and calls and unless something fundamentally changes about the company I probably won’t sell anything for at least a year. I truly believe BB can be $20-$30 EOY as a conservative estimate.
Has anyone seen what’s happening in Ireland with Covid? Feels like last year all over again. Everyone distracted by politics/impeachment while a new Covid strain is about to fuck us all.

I'm holding at least a few months probably, depending how it looks.
Hold lol. You need more buyers it not enough by to hold. You’ll eventually reach exhaustion. Then we’ll see how loyally your fellow holders hold. When it come to money people care about themselves only.
It fucking is
At $50 you’re going to have lots of people up 100 - 300% you will see some resistance because people will cash out some.

At the same time a true squeeze will be fast and volatile.  You could easily see spikes into the 100s.

Easily still upside, it is hard to predict how shorts will unwind.
PPPPSTHHHHH!
So I'm retarded in the lame way, let's say the short squeeze is bigger than anyone hopes for and the share price goes up to something stupid like $1000.

What does that look like for us in terms of cashing out? Also not knowing what how a short squeeze works, what's compelling the short holders to buy shares at $1000? Is it margin? Or does the share price just stay that high until they have to close their shoes position?

I am not selling till we hit 100, but it depends on people entry and there profit limit. Everyone is different but it might be good to sell at 100, 200, 420, 640 etc limits
All your posts are about this. I heard the same thing in August and November too, why now?
Yeah, great timing. I held it for longer, swinging it since Aug-Sep. it was easy to find entry-exit points and it really traded off technicals.

Right now, I see some cool off and another wave. Also, I think shares are the way here, because like I told that other guy, I think we’ll see an IV crush. This is the volatile movement that the market was pricing in - approval or denial of Thacker Pass on 1/15/21.
The first dungeon is great, though.

Hmmmm maybe but I would sell on an up day even for a loss because breaking even would be very lucky.
I fully believe that housing prices are headed up. Fed trying for increased inflation, lumber prices soaring making new construction significantly higher, low interest rates making real estate a much more attractive investment... but 75% in three months would be truly insane. As in the government just purchased all the nearby property type of crazy.

Don’t do it. You’ll get run over on average.

If you do do it, you need a decent sized account and a way to on average lean long (futures on average are net up - there’s a long study about this going back 20+ years).
I see a bunch of retards here loading up on shares and options for GME...I don’t know if you realize the squeeze is OVER. The individuals responsible for the squeeze got their gains and left a while ago with real bag. Now y’all retards are left holding the baggage they offloaded like a true retard.
Who gives a fuck, it dumps, we load up on shares, Ryan Cohen still turns this company around, fuck off dude, you already see what Cohen can do and the belief in him, even if it tanks, the second Cohen releases his long-term plans GME will moon again

Go in to Robinhood, select all of your shares of GME, and put in a "Limit Sell" order, and for shits set it for $1,000.

&#x200B;

Also, that last drop-down, make it "good till expiry" so it will last 90 days, or until the stock hits $1K 😜

&#x200B;

Lastly, BUY MORE SHARES ON TUESDAY!

Next week
Well "slow" may not be the appropriate term. Cliche and predictable would probably be better, and slow character development/flat characters. This of course is fixed in later seasons
To maintain this price level you’d need the sub to hold these shares and gains for years, then have the turn around plan actualy work, which it may not, which in turn would create a market to sell into. Or you’d need to keep adding new money, and you have to buy Tesla with that stim check too. 

But the point he’s making is very few institutions are going to be enthusiastic about bagholding at this price level, so while you are finding people to sell you stock to buy, selling pretty soon will just be to other wsb people. And many of us are on a clock with options. This company isn’t going back to the single digits any time soon, but this price level isn’t sustainable for more than a week or two or three.

This depends on lot of factors. One of significant ones are  volatility

GME is getting screwed because of volatility. As the stock suddenly became volatile they increased the requirement.

Other less significant is concentration. If you have all shares in only one company or one industry then the requirement is higher

XPEV. Hasn't run up yet compared to NIO, and it usually plays catch up so I'm expecting to see above 55 next week since the earnings run-up should start anytime. Seeking Alpha also published a very bullish article on it today, so we might get that sweet boomer volume on Tuesday.

Unlikely, but it happens when a sharp increase in Volatility. Seeing we are now up 7-10x trading volume, amongst other factors, brokers have to keep their best interest at heart on the margin loans they provide. Happened with Tesla a few months ago.

Different environment now I guess. Everyone is so bullish due to the Fed saying they have the market's back and cash is now trash so no one wants to hold it so they dump it into the market. Every slight bounce we have is followed by a V shape bounce.

Noob investor here,

Is it too late to buy market price at open?
The truth is, that after watching GME for Months and messing up my trades (only up 50% when the stock is up 100%)... I expect us to drop another 20% before the squeeze.... Notice that the ryan cohen announcment was on MONday and we didn't get this rocket untilll...... Thursday. There is some bizzare LAG to news with GME. 

Alas! We have to buy and hold. Just buy as much as you can and set a sell limit you are comfortable with 80% Shares  20% calls. Roll with the 20% - 30% red and then Moon. I'm selling half at $60 and the rest at $400 .

Sell TSLA calls and plow them into GME? Hm..
That’s fair.  I’m just super competitive so I hate losing
To put it simply - some dickhead thinks the stock is going to go down. So he "borrows" shares. Sells them at market value, then once the price has dropped buys them back and returns them. 

A short squeeze happens when too many dickheads get this idea and then the price doesn't go down. Now they need to return the shares except they don't have any, so they're bidding each other up because there aren't enough shares on the open market to fill what they need - and the price explodes.

Now, this short squeeze will give us what PT? I see people calling for mid 500's. As much as that would rock, DeepFuckingValue says 60 is fair. Which is it. 

Thanks again, getting some confidence going into next week. Now the questions is, will is last all week or just a Tuesday pump (if we get that)

I ran the math back on this...it checks out. Prestock split, TSLA was trading at $299 on 10/24/19. 1/15/21 690C was trading around $1.55 per contract. OP buys 10 for $1550. TSLA splits 5:1, OP now has 50 contracts for 138C. TSLA trading around $845 today for intrinsic value of ~$700 per contract. 700x50x100(shares per contract)=3.5mil.

Oh okay thanks, makes sense I just didn’t know if it was that common. I guess GME would be an instance where that would happen if there ever was one.

I could see some of this institutional guys not wanting to rock the boat too much, ya'know? The more the game stays out of the public's eye and the less they try to screw each other over, the easier it is for everyone to keep playing the game.

I doubt Wall Street wants more people figuring out WS is just gambling because there is an interest piece about GME on the front page of every random news website.

so if I go to optionsprofitcalculator.com, the calculations tell me you can make dozens/hundreds/thousands buying up one or a few dozen call contracts at 0.01-0.10 and selling them before expiration. if my retarded quick research is correct, the idea is one of two things: either they don’t fill, or that they will but nobody unless they are also retarded is going to buy them and they’re simply going to expire. i did a few of these trades but I can cancel them. should I or just gamble?

I used to smile and be happy when I saw people. Now I simply see them as people that will cause me more issues. It's not who I am yet here I am in a job that demands it. I quit college 6 years ago to take this promotion to lift my now wife and I out of poverty and I have been questioning it everyday fir a few years. It's been the best and worst thing I've ever done at the same time. Be smart with your money and invest it wisely, build a FUCK YOU fund and use it when you find your conscience and mental health faltering. All I do in my job is get shit from upper management to hit numbers, get shit from employees for the shit I have to do to hit numbers, and get shit from Karen's because they're having a bad day.

I really appreciate you taking the time to listen and engage a bit, even if you really don't care. It seems like somedays it's me vs the planet. Sorry again to get so wound up. Have a good night kind stranger. Know that you made a stranger's night
Did you sell? in which case you're retarded.

If you didn't sell and you are only down $3k then toughen up, we've all been there, shorts haven't covered and brokers are margin calling, next week is going to be amazing.

It seems to me like he is someone that likes to look at theoretically perfect trades in hindsight and decided to post some fan fic of one of those trades.

This DD is lacking all things DD. 

Here are the facts:

I work nuclear nearly everyday, unfortunately. 

I am a full, 100% supporter of the energy source. It is the answer to our energy problems. That's not what liberals want. Nuclear is scary because they are ignorant on the topic, this fact will not change. 

Biden has a 400 billion dollar plan for everything. It means shit. 

Nuclear plants require at minimum 6 years to build and massive capital. Vogel will be the last new plant USA sees for a long time. Small modular reactors may be the only hope but let's be real, most liberals want wind turbines and solar panels. SMRs will be trial run only for years. 

Zero point zero chance Beijing Biden (or Kamala) gets any new nuclear plant even in the preconstruction phase in his 4 years. 


I put out some DD on the energy topic a few days ago. It's one of the only topics I have experience in. If you're betting on nuclear related industries it will be the biggest boomer hold of your lifetime.

Varying opinions.

Some reports indicate 100% or close to of all shares are shorted still.  The short squeeze has yet to happen.  The downward pressure this week was due to these margin rules people who were long using margin had to sell.

Shorts basically survived this week, but their options are running out to keep positions open.  If enough people keep holding and going long with cash the squeeze could actually happen.

So the big squeeze hasn’t occurred yet, lots of pieces have fallen in place to make next week potential fireworks going off.
All part of the casino that is wallstreetbets. Put it all on red!
On any brokerage its literally just an option. "Buy" "Limit" "Sell" "Sell Short".

The brokerage matches up whatever institution is loaning the stock to the "seller", and you don't have to pre-determine a short price. You can close your position the next day if it dips a little bit.

That's why DFV was saying the big money shorts in GME were betting on zero, since they didn't close their position given any of the volatility, ups/downs, whatever, over the past 6-12 months, so he knows they're in for the long haul. They might still think GME's fundamentals are bad and it still could go down, so they're perhaps willing to ride out the storm, which is why buying and holding the shares is so important.

Eventually, if GME keeps going up, the people who loaned the stock will say "Okay, enough's enough, gimme my stock back, you clearly lost." and they'll be forced to buy at whatever the market price is. Also, in the mean time, they're paying fees on the difference between the short price and whatever the current price is.

The biggest difference is that shorts are bought on margin and you are fully at risk. If the stock goes to infinity, you just lost infinity. Buying a put option only puts you at risk up to the cost of the put. It can expire worthless and you're out your money, but you aren't on the hook for buying the stock.
Yea I know. But in similar ways to Porsche, if RC exercised his options and increased his shares, and  released a form 4, it’ll send similar shockwaves as far as the news is concerned around. 

Will it beat vw? No. Will it kick off the squeeze and send everyone in a frenzy? Yes.

Based on the numbers that at least I’m aware of, it would take ~6 days for shorts to fully cover their positions. Now we should be getting updated numbers on how many shares are still sold short soon. So that days to cover (DTC) could be more or could be less.


My advice would be to set multiple limit orders for your shares at various prices. That way you can take advantage of the volatile movement but not get left holding once the squeeze had squozed
good idea

No your last sentence actually isn’t supported by the data. When it opens -2/-3%, it’s historically been flat intraday on average and thus all long positions including the leveraged ETFs will decay on average. Sure some days it might go down more, some it might go up, but on average it doesn’t go down more and you can’t predict that either.
Run up for earnings!
I'm supposed to explain something to my boss. No more than 1200 words.
That sounds great. My only concern overall is that the EV bubble is about to pop. I don’t know if you’ve noticed, but even boomer car manufacturers like Toyota, Ford, Hyundai, etc. are getting in the EV game and a lot of EV companies with barely a fraction of revenue of boomer car car companies are worth more than them. I fear the competition is increasing too much and it’s a flavor of the year type of thing
I bought at 8 9 and 10 it's a sure thing 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Listen, buddy, clearly you have access to a future news paper. 

Why don't you stop jerking us around and fess up.
Probably the same.
Stock drop fast = IV up.  stock rise fast = IV up.  IV up = more expensive options.  With high IV You’ll pay the same for a 100% OTM call as you would for a 30% OTM call on a stock with low IV.  (IV is implied volatility for all the smooth-brained meatballs out there)

Bro. They have $11 per share of cash. Plus they have an operating company. Absolute worse case it settles back down to $20-$30/share and then Cohen’s strategy brings it up to $50 over the next 12 months.

But realistically, there’s no way with all this interest we don’t get a short squeeze. Gme wasn’t even on the top Robinhood stocks this week. By end of next week I’m sure it will be

I think you are missing the point that most people here in this sub lose money, and that is a plus for Wall Street because someone on the other side is taking the trade. The more people and liquidity there is in the market the better it is for Wall Street I.e more money to game. This sub getting shut down should be the least of your worries, because it won’t.

Damn should have gotten the multiplier.
That’s cause some of them are still bagholding CSCO or even CMGI.
When you buy a contract, you're giving the contract seller money right at the time of the transaction. After that happens, you can do whatever you want with that contract. If you want to sell it the next day, you can. If you want to sell it on the day of expiration, you can. It's your choice to do what you want, and it will not cost you more money to sell the contract, regardless of the price of it at the time of the sale.
So be it, Trade the GME tendies for corn

But when you hedged and some that call, now someone else is short the call. They have to buy from someone to cover the call. All this does is passes the buy pressure down the line, but it doesn't eliminate it.
That’s true, but it also crashed back to the prior levels after. Don’t be greedy. Getting to insane values on technical factors means finding a buyer will be very limited.
It all depends on how rocky the next week is and if the paper hands fold and start selling.

They just filed a shelf offering on 12/4/2020. That they can issue at any time at any price. 

Hypothetically... Can't they trickle out shares for the next few months to dilute and keep prices under the warrant trigger prices, and bone the warrant holders, saving the company a ton on warrant redemptions while raising additional capital at the same time?

Or they just filed it for fun.

>what happens if you cancel the set sell?

Orders never fill unless conditions are met. When they expire without anything happening, your broker should send you a message when they cancel the order that says something to the effect of "such-and-such order expired" and your buying power will be returned to your account. So you'll never "accidentally" lose money on an order in that way.

>I would set sell for the END of market hours on 1/19

I don't know any brokers that will do a "sell at a certain time" order. Maybe yours does? If you put in a sell order when the market's closed, the broker will fill as soon as possible. They usually have "extended hours" which will let you sell before the market opens.

Where does the Cost basis per share = $0.31  come from? 

My understanding is this guy has the right to buy 5000 TSLA stocks for 138 per share (far below what the actual value is now).  He could also sell the contracts themselves for 3.4mil (?).

How the value of the contracts are calculated is what im pretty unclear on, any help appreciated.
Sorry for your loss. I got 1150 at .53. Made the new year very exciting so far

I say this subreddit should realize it now has the ability to force opinion on GME by shear number of shares owned. I want to see us own 15% of GME.
Should’ve used the rinnigen to trade places with your own shit
New account with bearish sentiment 🤔
The fact that it’s an EV company (extremely hyped) with real products (very sexy looking models), awesome battery tech, great management including former Tesla workers, based in the US, and first batch of vehicles hitting the streets coming this year I believe first half. Their prices are high (69k for the cheapest) but once they start up and start expanding they’ll create cheaper EV’s for the lower middle class and such. They just finished their first plant in Arizona I believe able to spit out 40k vehicles a year and iirc that output will increase dramatically in future expansions.
Once you get enough$$ buy an ITM leap and then sell weeklies... as long as you sell enough to cover the cost of the leap before you get assigned you it will be a risk free trade.
Da fook is that?
If you have 1m intraday buying power what’s the best play when market corrects (when you see -3% all across indexes?) $500,000 SQQQ & $500,000 VIXY?

Just buy more, the higher it goes without these drops or at least a couple of months of sideways action, the harder it'll eventually crash so these pullbacks are good.
Same here, I think we break $30s next month 🚀
They are hoping that this run up entices GME to sell shares. This will drop the price and allow them to cover.  

So they’re hoping they can drag out the run up slow enough that the board will have to decide whether they issue more stock and pay off debts or let the stock run.

their short float is a part of their fundamentals. i never neglected the fact that GME has high short float. but don’t pretend that GME actually has good fundamentals going for them besides their short float which i’ve noted in my original post.

Your experience is exactly why I’m not looking forward to potentially entering management. Telling someone “fuck you kid. Fuck your sudden loss. I’ll see you Monday.” It’s just not something normal people are naturally fine with. Sometimes a change of work is best for your mental health not sure where you are with that. But to be willingly putting a company’s interest over someone’s family and mortgage doesn’t sit right with me. Maybe with the Biden presidency everyone will be better off and everything will be perfect /s 

This goes without saying, if you’re ever really lost in thought about your work, speaking with someone always goes a long way pride aside.

You know what fuck it. I will follow the smarter retards.
I’ll throw some tendies once this prints.
i understand that, but the only thing going for GME as a stock is their short float. it’s perfectly fine to play GME. but don’t act like their their 3b valuation makes sense for a company that was going under pre-covid and during covid. imagine a world where GME’s short float is nonexistent, they would be back down to the penny stock they once were.

that being said, don’t tel someone to play stocks as if it’s fair game. buying the stock is even more risky than options for GME.

Your comments & logic are stupid.
Not at all, the VW infinity squeeze dipped quite a bit before it went almost straight up. The same or something similar but to a lesser degree could happen. We have to be prepared to lose even more next week, stay strong and buy as much for as cheap as you can folks.
Ok that makes sense now. Thanks.
It's funny because the 5 yr chart reminds me of a 3x inverse etf.
It’s gone up 100% over 3 days, I’m not about to jump on it now. Ill wait for a pull back. I’m looking for a low risk/medium award play for mere 100%

Wouldn’t be surprised to see Cohen had this whole thing planned out, perfect play is to max his shares then come out with some statements directly from Cohen about the future of the company and his plans.

Ahhhhhh fuck
VW is the only sample size we have here, but of course things are pretty different now.

On this end, I'm likely holding till $100 but past that it goes past what I perceive to be fair value of the shares. will set sell limits at $150 or higher just to catch the squeeze in case I'm not around at that time. Once the short squeeze ends, might still hold some shares because I truly believe in the chewy effect.

tldr; sell some for short term gains, keeping some for long term
Gotcha. Thought theyd just pay you 4/5 days.

Just sell before, retard
My man, at least you’re not down 90%. Been there and had to take a break. You can turn around -27% no problem. You got this!
[removed]
? You can buy shares whenever. When you set limit sell orders, you choose the price you’re willing to sell your shares for and how many shares you’re willing to sell at that price.

So you can have multiple limit sell orders in place for your shares.
Your meant to watch when the pump starts. Then buy when you see momentum and
Volume. Then take the 50% rise and then sell and go to the next play. So your down a few thousand no big deal it’s only 1% of your entire portfolio.
Screw Bezos and his shiny bald head. I took a bath on a debit spread through the holiday, watching AMZN crush earnings in November and still drop 5% the next day.  Good riddance to that garbage
Two gangs can make money at the same time. Can't feel bad missing out on a PLTR run I didn't think was coming if it means taking part in an incredible run on GME. I think PLTR is an amazing pick for the long term.

Why do you think your too late for GME? It has a 2b market cap and holiday sales were 1.8b. This company actually has legs to grow and should be valued around 90. That’s not including the incoming short squeeze but in fundamentals alone, GME is actually a solid play.

Nothing concrete but the rumor is that the Saudi family is trying to prepare for a post oil world by heavily investing in EVs. It's a generational play because they have a nation state to uphold. 
If they get their feet into the companies now then they will maintain those holdings forever. 

Also a lot to do with Lucid operating within their borders so maintaining some ownership it's pretty much a duh. It would comprise a large portion of their economy and thus constitute a matter of national security on their end.

In 2019 volatility on massively otm options was extremely low.

Options have become very expensive in the last year due to how volatile the market is. Ffs tesla gained 700% last year and swings 5+% a day. Finding cheap leaps is fucking impossinle now. Back in 2019 when people though tesla was a failure? You bet your ass massively otm leaps were cheap as shit.

Buy $60 FDs. AS MUch as possible, and then exersice them on tusday, (P.S. Thats retarded, exercising FDs doesn't affect stock price, HOWEVER if everyone on WSB exercicses all their options at the same time (doesn't matter the price) that would  cause the float to lock up.

Nope. Thought Americans were against socialism. Getting a paid day off is socialist?
Roger. I’ll buy all I can with whatever GME pays out as
I would be sweating bullets on that 3/19 one, mainly cause of the gpu shortage and cause Intel just got in the picture as of recent.

you must be part of the new class of retarded autists. i know it sounds crazy, but it wasn’t that long ago that TSLA was a dog of a stock and the tesla bears dominated it. 200% OTM leaps selling for 0.5% of common isn’t out of the ordinary

But the fact that that price is a joke, makes me think.... no.

Just getting started, increasing my position on Tuesday. BB 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I have been watching this stock go up since $2 thinking about getting in, missed the boat. They make the best 3d printers for circuit boards. The big advantage is IP protection for sensitive applications like military, where you can risk outsourcing the manufacturing and also for low volume production. One of the recent run ups was when ARK added them
GME.
Nah not here. I think we are slowly coming around to realize this isn’t going away. It’ll mutate and stick around forever. We will mitigate until a vaccine or until it mutates into something less deadly to old people.
300 shares at $20 here! How high do you guys think the squeeze will take us?! Personal retarded estimation: $$$$469
Remember when DFV got the hate for yoloing into GME? And people said GME was a shit company? That was cool.
Thats pretty much where I'm at. I manage a retail store that does 10+ million in sales per year. When we were so undertaffed this year out PT people worked OT to help the store. Our company had its best year ever despite the pandemic. Then they cut our hazard pay at the height of the spike this summer and slashed my labor budget. I have PT people coming up to me and begging me for more hours since my boss forced me to cut hours. If i don't, I get in deep shit and maybe can't feed my family. If I cut hours they can't feed theirs. I just can't do this anymore and keep my conscience. All this while the company made record profits. The entire situation makes me sick as hell and has torpedoed my mental state lately. 

Sorry to have been so long winded. It's just that nobody seems to understand the shit people in my job go through and I just had to spew it. Come on Finance degree. 2 fucking years damnit

You're right, this is fundamentally different. We're not running a scam, we have a bunch of paper hand bitches on board. On the other hand, we have the *sheer number* of shorts that will need to be covered. 

So, what's more important? The ability to spook retail investors into selling, or 10x short interest volume? I honestly don't know the answer. It's going to be interesting to see how this goes.
Hope so I may have overleverage in big tech during today
Fuck you

He means no one is going to sell their shares in masses like you retards think. It doesn't make sense to if you're highly invested in the success of the company. Why would you sell your shit at 25 dollars a share if you know your company will be worth 300 dollars a share in 2-3 years. The answer is you don't unless you're a retard like the retards here. At least that's what I think he means. Look at Tesla, no one ever sells their fucking shares and it just goes up and up and up.
Why...?
I think they come on ships from china

Sold 56 shares of GME at 19. I'm fucking retarded.
Its better for the autists to think that there's no shorting - we need them to lay down their buying power. it will not be in vain.

You need more monies to open margin position

As an example, assume an account holder wants to purchase 1,000 shares of Facebook. which is quoted at $200 per share. The total cost for this transaction in a cash balance account would be $200,000. However, if the account holder opens a margin account and deposits the 50% initial margin requirement, or $100,000, the total purchasing power will rise to $200,000. In this case, the margin account has access to two-to-one leverage.
Well they didn't buy before close so  probably missed out on 20%
so like what sensible long term investing?

This was such a crazy event back in the day. 

I thought on shorting GME but I remember Dr Burry was all jazzed up about it a year ago and had a large position. Since I couldn’t find anything that he dumped it, decided it’s best not to bet against him. Honestly it’s been a tough 12 months if you’re a short seller. So much endless froth it’s like a SBUX.

Goodnight all. May your dreams be full of short squeeze tendies

Question... I notice certain stocks are no longer found when I search for them. These include MT, STM among others. Can someone with RH tell me if these stocks appear for them?
Fuck it’s my first year as a Canadian being in this place and I gotta learn bout y’all dumb holidays
RemindMe! 8 hours waiting for someone smarter to comment
Still early here. I’m lurking for that midnight wisdom. Where the WSB sages at
(in all seriousness, the entire GME thing has Intrigued me, and finally decided this will be the time to dive in. 
But I'm either too stupid or too impatient to understand the various YouTube vids on the subject of stocks, so it's pretty limited what I've understood so far. 

+ It will be the perfect poetic justice, to spend some of my last "paycheck" from Gme. And by "paycheck", I mean "the extra money the court ordered Gme to pay all of us, after they tried to bounce with our last check + bonus, in hopes that the pandemic spontaneously would induce a sort of collective amnesia, forgetting we ever worked/managed their shitshow of a business".
Holy shit. Calm down Chad Dickens.

Oh yeah i can’t buy more shares. I can sell the ones I own though
very few noobs? some retard just asked what a bid ask spread is but didn't know how to word it because hes that retarded
Hey OP try to avoid the term MMT if you can, it's a spam ticker. I'll check how often it's used and maybe mark it a common word if there's a low probability of hijinx.
Lol, Biden loves China. Suspicious11 loves kool aid. Great bet to back 😝
Realistically how much squeezing is left in GME
No. I am also in 20% cash gang because I am a retard too. It's ok.
Nice work man. Long-term favorable tax rate on it too.
Bruh, just hold, I was in when the stock fell from $9 to &6, and again when it fell from $15 to $11.

Both of those drops were larger in percentage terms, and each time you were rewarded for holding and making memes.

Just hold till we get to $150/share and sell out then 🚀🚀🚀😎
What is the next Tesla?

That’s the thing with Netflix is it really hard for them to grow without figuring out a way to stop sharing passwords. Do you actually know really anyone that doesn’t have Netflix or access Netflix in the country?

The shorts keep shorting more, fucking 🌈🐻s. I’m in for 1250

Edit: I’m a reformed gay bear.
The furthest I can go back is to the start of 2020, and with the lowest strike of 200c, since 138c doesn't exist anymore. Now with an even 50% further out strike of 200c, and using a comparable price of ~80 dollars in middle of March, I get a price of $39.32 (and that is adjusted for the split, it is $196.59 pre split for this option).

I just can't find anything suggest that 16 month out options, regardless of how far out the money it is, would ever be in the range of $2 premium.
Okay wow these calls are cheap asf.  Imma get in on this.
You're pretty damn fucked. I mean forget it, money's gone. Chart looks like AMZN in January 99. Vicious stuff.

I don't need to read to know you are a bot hired by the 🌽 industry. 

Calls on 🥕
Sure.  There's nothing forcing you to exercise all 50 contracts at the same time.  He could sell 10 of the calls for the cash to exercise the other 40 for 4000 shares.

Or he could have last month, they expired today.
😐 been there.... thought I was staring down the barrel of another 20% hit day this time last night. Somehow was able to pull 2% green
... You don't actually believe I'm sitting on 100% of my buying power waiting for a crash right?

Im talking something along the lines of 15-25%.
That's wild because it shutdown months ago. Creator went dark and the site changed. Left a goodbye message. 

Maybe it came back for a bit, but I wouldn't be surprised if it's gone again.

Ok here's the 10 second summary: if you held the stonk for less than a year (and since it's GME that's probably the case), your capital gains are just taxed as regular income according to the usual tax brackets. Long term capital gains (holding over a year) are where there's a possibility of 0% tax, but that probably doesn't apply to you.

>Come on over to /r/vitards steel daddy is no longer welcome here

Unless Vito was on the Robinhood board that got $MT removed from their tradeables, I don't see what he could have been doing here that constitute market manipulation. Arcelor-Mittal is the largest steel producer in the world and is like #140 on the Fortune500. And his plays are relatively lowkey compared to the daily $GME / $TSLA / $PLTR / etc. spam. Everything after the initial post was mostly him giving broader industry updates...

If the mods really do believe that he was manipulating the markets, then it would be good of them to explain how so, or where they think he was being dishonest or misleading.
Anyone follow HF positioning via futures? Looks like they are net short the sp500
its that thing you can buy with the calls if you forget to close them

At least anyone who asks what they should buy this weekend.
Lol the funny thing about it is that company culture is all about working people like slaves bc the company shares SOOOOO MUCH profit with us for year end bonuses. Bitch that shits literally 6 fucking percent after taxes. I'm fortunate enough that I'll be in a decent enough position to quit in 6 months when I start business school and just work PT somewhere. It's all just a game to me. My company loves to go strictly by policy like they're a bunch of lawyers. I just know where the cracks are and try to piss off the District Manager as much as possible while not doing anything to actually get me fired. Too many bathroom breaks? Slam that cunt with a dr note for IBS

"A user known as u/1R0NYMAN sold a box spread creating a $300,000 credit that should have netted him from $40,000-$50,000 over the course of 2 years. He described the trade as a way to make **"risk free money"**, but he was unaware of the assignment risk. A few days later some of the options were exercised against him, causing a loss of over $60,000; calculating from the original amount in the user account, $5,000, the negative return of the trade was -1832.99%. As a result, Robinhood decided soon after that it would no longer allow the trading of box spreads. The user withdrew $10,000 from the account before the positions were closed; it is believed by Marketwatch that the brokerage itself took the majority of the loss."

Nah, he didn't win yet. He beat Level 1. That's "don't need a job" money. Level 2 is "chartered private jet" money. Level 3 is "own my own jet" money. Level 4 is megayacht money. If you hit Level 5, Robinhood resets all WSB accounts to zero and we all start over.

I meant to comment before, but -2.48%. I bought puts with 2 week expiry on Thursday, so the damage was minimized since my options are are at least 35+ days to expiry. I suspected that Biden’s speech wouldn’t be enough to overcome OpEx.

WSB has completely forgotten how to put their bear hats on. If we decline rest of the month, retard FD buying perma bulls are going to get wiped just like the ones in Febuary, March, June September, and October of 2020. It may seem like we’re hitting ATHs all the time, but WSB forgets 5/12 months last year we drilled heavily.

I think it's going to be like BB if not better due to lack of competition in the telecomms sector.
Well if you are serious and the shorts haven’t covered then yeah put as much as you want in GME. Buy 100 shares and sell silly calls on it.

Short sellers have to cover at some point
What if they do the opposite and do buybacks. They could start the buying ( or even just them hinting at a buyback) would lead to the shorts scrambling to cover and create the squeeze.
yes
Question... why doesn’t MT show up on RH
Just bought 20 shares. That's at least 20 🚀 's right? 🥲

Having a % of your portfolio as cash is not meant to time the marker but:

1)Allow you to survive an actual correction
2)Dollar cost average your long term positions
3)Allows you to get into new plays

In other words, having money not tied up should also be considered a position.
They drag my name through the mud through the dirt

But ima make you eat your words
They likely will after it moons, they’d be stupid not to, Ryan Cohen is not stupid, they already have the option to issue more shares, this feels like a long-term play with many steps by Cohen.  It’s not coincidence he buys in, they announce the option of a shelf offering, he buys in more, he gets his friends on the board, suddenly the price starts to take off, I wouldn’t be surprised to next see him announce he’s increasing his stake up to 20%, it’s the logical next step.
Genius. I'm in!

is it true biggest factor for a crash is interest rate and feds won’t change that until 2023 meaning things will go well till then

Do you know if RH will allow this come Tuesday? 

Trying to get funds into my account ASAP; don’t want to liquidate my TSLA position
oh yeah baby hit me up with that good crayon shit 💯💯
You keep losing money yet you don’t learn : you only can blame yourself

One of us.
Definitely not. Most of us making fun of you are long term investors from TIC so we don't really mind. But seeing shorts getting rekt is always a joy
??
Look, from my anecdotal experience buying at open has been bad for me. And there have been dips consistently after open for the last two days. The likelihood of this blasting off from open into the sky will be clearer as we approach Tuesday. But, everyday we keep this up is one day closer we get to the big jump. Either way, what I've learned is try to average difficult decisions up. If it up in premarket it might be another daily rise on the slow move towards the squeeze (or smaller possibility its the big one), so maybe wait a bit then go for a big chunk. But maybe allot a small percentage at open and monitor the price closely.
Do people think that it's going to dip more before the infinity squeeze happens or should I buy as much as I can at $35.50?

WSB should have a wiki with time periods given different names. Like "Boss Baby April " or today would be "The Great GME Cuckening". There would be so much dank lore.

It was one of the three most shorted stocks today.
Yes.  And you can ruin your life with it, or change it for the better forever.  Don’t play with what you can’t lose, and take profits when you can.
I'm not an expert on this, so I've read explanations at this point which made sense to me, but I can't remember each and every detail.

But I think it's correct to say that in addition to the potential squeeze driving up the price, until the short sellers are able to cover their shares, they'll have to pay interest that gets higher the higher GME goes up.
Don’t pay attention to the gain porn, you’ll lose everything if you try and replicate it
Greatest sub in Reddit history
I closed my 1800-share PLTR position when it was 7% up to get jacked to the tits in GME (2950 shares total now). Stopped paying attention to PLTR as I was obsessing over GME...and now I see it ended the day at under +3%??? Come one with that shit--people were sure it was going to have an amazing day, but then it did what it has been doing for two months--start up, then bleed down all day(s). I'll be back in after the squeeze, but I feel like I made the right call in the short term.

**Chapter 1: Ambrosia**  

Encased in a glimmering ensemble consisting of assless chaps and a shiny leather bondage hood, Tim 🍏's piece of shit body stood over the frightened boy (we'll name him Calls). A sinister look could be found underneath Tim's spectacles, if not for the anime-glare that was cast from the exhausting wickers of candles strewn about the room.

Calls had been imprisoned in Tim 🍏's makeshift fuck den for almost 2 weeks. Though there were no windows, it became easy for him to tell how many slumberless days had passed. You see, no matter how many hours of relentless assault on the poor boys holes, Timmy could only orgasm to his own image. Four feet away from the stirrups shackling Calls was a gigantic mirror, and after each villanous anal assault, Tim would grasp his pulsating, hemoragging cock and finish himself off whilst leering at his own image in the mirror. 6 dickenings a day. 66 total virile gobs of inferior Tim Cook semen on the mirror; That's 11 days quick maffs.  
  
A nonchalant super casual cockslap to the face of Calls  brought him back to reality. Tim's cock snailed it's way off of the poor boys face, a putrid trail of various humanic juices oozing off. "Thought you could buy the dip, did ya, worm?" Tim 🍏 sneered. 

Tim gandered his way around to the exposed backside of Calls, before beckoning out to his stupid fucking idiot robot Alexa. "Alexa, bring up the ticker." Various noises that sounded like Optimus Prime having sex with an ATM started to eminate betweenst  a section of candles, where after a myriad of robotic whinery, a monitor showing $AAPL and it's stock price appeared in in a ghastly white font. 

Anticipation started to boil over Tim 🍏, licking his dry ass dips unable to contain himself much longer. In a flash, the font on the monitor flickered and went red, the ticker decreasing. A gutteral, heathenous cackle escaped his mouth before......

His soul had approached that region where dwell the vast hosts of the dead. He was conscious of, but could not apprehend, their wayward and flickering existence. His own identity was fading out into a grey impalpable world: the solid world itself, which these dead had one time reared and lived in, was dissolving and dwindling.
A few light taps upon the pane made him turn to the window. It had begun to snow again. He watched sleepily the flakes, silver and dark, falling obliquely against the lamplight. The time had come for him to set out on his journey westward. Yes, the newspapers were right: snow was general all over Ireland. It was falling on every part of the dark central plain, on the treeless hills, falling softly upon the Bog of Allen and, farther westward, softly falling into the dark mutinous Shannon waves. It was falling, too, upon every part of the lonely churchyard on the hill where Michael Furey lay buried. It lay thickly drifted on the crooked crosses and headstones, on the spears of the little gate, on the barren thorns. His soul swooned slowly as he heard the snow falling faintly through the universe and faintly falling, like the descent of their last end, upon all the living and the dead.

It was a 170-180 dollar stock and topped out at 635, it became the most valuable company in the world despite days earlier being expected to go bankrupt.  A greater short squeeze but with a lesser company was actually pulled off by Martin Shkreli, he made a company that was on the verge of shutting down completely with no tangible product increase by 10,000% in value.

If there's something we can all agree on, it's that BB today was fucking **brutal**. 

My theory is that it's because Melvin was trying to distract the retard army from GME. 

All told, he was actually fairly successful.

Put your money where your mouth is and go ahead and short it yourself if you think Jan 27 is going to be simply micro earnings for Tesla. Most shorts like yourself, probably fail to realize that Tesla operates in several Energy segments, Energy generation and storage, talking MACRO Energy stop thinking micro. Do yourself a favor, trust in ELON-He is probably from a different planet. While you shorts scheme, Don Elon is testing rockets and million mile batteries, probably with a spliff, How do I even mention everything Tesla does? But what you need to remember is Musk and Co.

This squeeze isn’t comparable to VW because Porsche controlled approximately 72% of the float by the time the news broke, and they were NOT selling. If the shorts haven’t covered yet, and we don’t know for sure, there will be profit taking by individuals on the way up because everyone will have their own price target and will want to get out before the next guy.
don't pretend you don't know.

Great idea. I’m down
The actual question is if our information is solid. Or if there are other ways for them to have covered that we haven't thought about. And that is a worry in all honesty because if short position was actually as fucked as we say it is? There are definitely analysts at big banks who've seen this, why haven't they jumped. I think perhaps it is because it's actually illegal to incite a short squeeze lmao. So maybe big banks cant get in on this play at a big enough level to make it worth without getting penetrated by the SEC. Keep in mind however, maybe they're just assholes who don't see it. Burry saw this (and then DFV and then all of us), and he's been one to see shit overlooked by the big boys before if you know what i mean. But yeah I was thinking the same thing and literally was just commenting that the first big player that moves in (if they can) can really be the catalyst we need.

What are these "shares" you speak of.
> Im just trying to secure a future for my family

First of all, that's heavy as fuck. This play is *highly* speculative. If you're dipping into rent money and shit, take that out at the end of tuesday. Play money and disposable income only. I'm confident in tuesday because we're protected by the short sale rule, but beyond that is the wild west, and usually when retail fights institutional investors, retail gets whomped.

>if I set a sell price that high do I have to set an expire date and if so when?

The brokerages I've used usually have a "good until canceled" option which pretty much lets the order sit there until it hits your PT.

>Like, will we be holding for a year until it reaches those insane numbers and my set sell triggers?

Beyond this point is 100% me talking out of my ass, but I've shown you the underpinning for my idea in my previous comment. I think tuesday is a possible candidate. Past that, we are counting on brokerages cranking up interest rates and margin requirements. The time frame for this should be relatively short, within this week. Again, I'm talking out of my ass. This is a gamble, albeit not a pure gamble.
Fuck off. I’ve been buying options for years and losing money. This is my last stand.
So is it worth buying an option on it at this point? Or no? Sorry I’m full retard and don’t really know anything going on just throwing around my house refinance money

Okay Epstein
Just get a fractional share of GME but for real if you can't afford to lose it don't yolo it. I usually pay mortgage and utilities once I get paid and yolo the rest and drink generic ass soda. But like, if you need that money to keep the lights on, please don't yolo it. Figure out how to scrimp for the yolo. Shit, I pretty much stopped drinking since april so I could drop more onto stonks instead of credit card payments. The only way you get fucked is to bet something you can't lose. Also because the cheapest GME options are like hundreds of dollars, but if you can sell naked options I would suggest setting up an online puerto rico business, moving the account to be owned by the company, and yolo that shit.

Why would the consoles need GME as the gateway vs Sony or MSFT doing it themselves?  The shift to streaming took out Gamefly, I can't imagine the retailers are that far behind - but doesn't mean there isn't money to be made off GME in the meantime.
Thanks for the tips. Super helpful. I’m gonna look more into leaps. I feel so slow learning all of this but I feel once I actually start trading more (and losing money lol) is when I’ll learn the fastest. Thanks again!

No worries friend, the most you can lose is the premium that you paid for the contracts. Google options profit calculator and you can see what you stand to gain/lose at different dates in the future and at different share prices. It is quite useful.

You did the right thing. My thoughts are it was a sell off because of 01/15 being such a high volume options date. I think Tuesday we go back to green.

F word not allowed here
1) Most people would tell you to just buy shares, especially since it helps contribute to their squeeze, but I'd say it's really up to you. IV is absolutely nutty though so it might not be the best environment to be an options buyer right now

2) We have no idea when it'll peak. Might be next week, might be further along the line. Important things to note would be how things pan out next week with talk of brokers raising margin requirements and sending out margin calls; also it'll be interesting to see the official short interest numbers on 27 Jan

3) I think there's time to open positions on Tuesday morning. In fact, some do speculate that there might be a dip on Tuesday as the change in margin requirement means retail investors who just purchased shares on margin may be forced to liquidate, leading to selling pressure.

Damn, I think I should remove my trailing stop order just in case...
I could see a rug pull Tuesday/Wednesday. But I think once Biden gets settled we continue to pump towards 400.

Was doing some math, say that there are 30k members in the sub that own GME (based on 20K views on DFV's latest video \* 50% as obviously not all have viewed yet), if you assume on average 350 shares a member this would mean that WSB likely owns \~1/6 of all GME shares. If you 'tards aren't all a bunch of paper hands this infinite squeeze might actually work.

Good analysis. I think there's a bunch of strong choices in the wind sector, that's why I like the ETF so I can just bet that the sector as a whole will do well. FAN isn't trading at a premium like TAN is for solar, for example. Not sure why wind doesn't get the same premiums that solar does, wind is cheaper than solar, and lots of countries are pushing offshore mandates. Seems like it's a chance to get in before the rush, where solar has already been bought out.

It's not going to make sense until you actually buy 1 (start with Calls) and see how the market movements actually affect its value. Preferably you'd do this with a paper account so you don't lose your ass first but of course you're not going to do that.
so lets say i buy a $12 Call for 6/18 for $BB for 10 contracts with premium of 2.41 totaling a Max Cost of $2410, at worse case scenario if i dont reach past the break even number 14.41 by the expiration date, the worse that can happen is i lose all of the $2410 right? i cant lose any more than that to a point where they'll take more money out from my bank or from my buying power? sorry for the retard questions i feel at home🤣thankss again 🤙🏼
Aite so I pretty much liquidated my portfolio on Thursday and slept in today and made no buys. What's the sentiment rn? I expected selling today, but are people worried this is the correction coming? Or just another dip to be snatched up?

GME Gang:

I have seen the light. You could say I’ve had a very IQ for all my life, but I think I’m coming down with a touch of the autism. 

Tuesday’s the day, but how to buy shares? 

I have no buying power in my RH account, but have some means at my disposal. 
Should I:

a) sign up for RH Gold, getting 25k instant deposit (25K < Account Balance <50K)

or 

b) liquidate my TSLA shares
(Avg Cost Basis: 46.43)

Ideally, I’d do neither, but I fear RH is going to sabotage a potential 🚀 launch, taking its sweet time processing a >25K deposit.

The big boys have 3 days to try and devise a plan to rattle our fragile, autistic psyche, come open on Tuesday. The beacons are lit; GME calls for aid. And I shall answer. Muster the funds!
The stock has been at $200 for years and he purchased a $675 call 18 months out.
The squeeze will last through several days, at the peak of the squeeze it could definitely hit over $200. The Volkswagen squeeze in 2008 with less short interest than GME went up to almost $1k per share at the peak so GME could easily hit $200 with a squeeze
Let’s short bust them
Just wait until that 300m share unlock in March
Guys I totally under underestimated Wall Street bets and you guys I thought this was the sideshow but you are really serious about holding the shorts feet to the fire!!
Made me open account for nothing 👎👎👎
The short squeeze will be helped by buying actual shares and not options. As for the peak price? Well, that’s the (multi) million dollar question. The only thing we can go on is past squeezes, and even those are all different from each other. Overstock got short squeezed last July/August, but was vastly different from the VW squeeze from ‘08. Basically no one really knows when it could happen. I personally think we’re going to need another catalyst in the near future if the institutional shorts are going to cover. Otherwise they can wait out WSB and retail to turn their short attention spans to another play. If you’re buying in, be prepared to hold for a couple months.

THE FUTURE IS NOW OLD MAN
A lot of open interest for 365 puts on the 20th
Can someone help me understand the process here. How exactly do you cash out of a position like this? I'm big dumb.

From my understanding, for OP to close the option to collect their $3.4m buckaroos, OP has to put in a sell order for their call option. From there, who is buying it? I don't understand where the $3.4 million comes from. Who's money is that?

Someone is buying the right from OP to purchase 5000 TSLA stocks for $138 (totaling $690k of shares) - that statement is correct, right? If so, it is costing someone $3.4 million to buy that right. If they did, the stock would be worth 5000 * $826 (current price), which is $4.1 million. 

So the inventive of someone buying this would likely be to exercise the option and then potentially selling the stock, netting them $690,000? (~$4.1m - $3.4m). Is this what's happening?
Bro that’s what im saying I wasn’t even kidding it’s a great play
 I was down over 50% on a lot of my biggest trades to be dead serious. Not weeklies like what you’re talking about. Nothing that was expiring immediately. But plays that were further out I guess like a month or 2. I averaged them all down. I buy when I see value. So if it’s down I just see a discount. Obviously i guess that changes if you’re buying daily’s. But I don’t think a stop loss is a “save all” for lottery tickets like that.  I guess I could be in the big minority there though.
I dropped 20 percent, it was pretty chill too
Ok for serious question, I keep seeing this crazy limit sell prices... I’m on RH and would just sell and a specific ridiculous high price and hope it feels leaving me zero shares of GME and an absolute fuck ton of money? 

This would mean that day the stock is going to parabolically go to the moon and we have to choose when to sell? Once the squeeze occurs will we all have time to sell and make those fat gains or will the price come right back down? Help a retard understand 

Position: 788 shares of GME!

Do you think its possible GME could become an app for consoles in which you pay a monthly subscription for and you can download/play whatever games they have in there? This is really the only scenario I see where they actually do hit that 400+ target. Could we really see a brick and mortar successfully transform to an ecommerce giant? Let me know what you think!

Is this over simplifying the situation? For example, couldn't a large institution then just drive the price up with their own deep pockets. Given the premise it seems like the obvious thing to do, but it hasn't happened yet. I am wondering what the odds are until an institution can hop on our side to drive the price up (e.g. Porsche VW squeeze scenario). Otherwise, WSB as a whole simply doesn't have enough capital to make a large enough movement. And boomers are dumb lmao.

No. The company has no obligation to short sellers. 

Yes, it would be in the company's interest that it happen. I'm sure many executives have call options as compensation. So stonk money number going up would be good. Additionally, the company could raise cash by selling shares at the higher price.

Great post. Been a follower for a while. Really appreciate it.
RIP Joanne Rogers

I cried the day Fred Rogers died
I wish I met a girl who did stocks. My wife and gfs have no idea what I'm talking about...
"Rabid retail investors" who just saw that they could squeeze 812 million out of short sellers in a single day by reading a subreddit. I'd be worried at this point.  I am no analyst and I don't have contacts in hedgefunds, banks or any other financial institution that can provide me with all the fancy analysis that this guy has, but I can see when something is brewing and has the potential to be game changing.

He did not believe the gains would hold up. If the landscape changed significantly in the last 48 hours, to the short sellers advantage, then I would have agreed with him, but it hasn't.

&#x200B;

* GME is still over subscribed by shorts. ( I believe more shorts were added today compared to yesterday)
* The squeeze is still in the news. (Yes Cramer, you should still talk about it)
* The stock is still up 50% from a few days ago
* GME is still on the SHO list (25 days in a row) 

The only major changes since Wednesday are (at least the ones i know about)

* Directors leaving the GME board are selling their stock (good for them)
* Schwab and Fidelity ended margin on GME (still need solid evidence on this, Fidelity didnt pick up my call after 93 minutes on hold)
* SEC 201 Uptick is in effect to next Tuesday

and I dont see these being to any advantage to a short seller, but I could be wrong.

In the 2008 VW squeeze, Porsche owned a shit ton of shares. To be specific according to Reuters;

*Porsche’s statement on Sunday revealed that it had raised its direct  stake to 42.6 percent, held a further 31.5 percent in cash-settled stock  options and that it intended to increase its holding in the world’s  third largest carmaker to 75 percent next year.*

If the momentum continues as it has this  week, the tsunami will build up and all it takes, is that Redditor to buy the last shares available before the big institutions become nervous.

There was a poll up a last month that showed redditors sat on close to 5% of the shares, I would almost bet that number is closer to 10 now.

Thats a fucking impressive number for a bunch of *rabid retail investors.*

&#x200B;

And mandatory 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

My old ass doesn't understand most of what you guys are talking about.  I guess I'll just invest in more GME and enjoy my beer.
What's it mean
there is only one more trading day to play the tender.
Yeah, i have been looking at GE tbf. The only issue with that for me is you have to buy the whole company, not the GE renewables section. Siemens GA is also building something similar an 11mw and a 14mw that may reach 15mw with a power boost, expected for 2022 and 2024. Vestas also has a 10mw turbine ready to go atm, so i am torn. GE however is a very enticing option since they also have a very successful aerospace business which has been very solid and will recover post covid especially with its GE9X engine for the 777x, which will receive significant orders in future as airlines replace existing cargo capacity and also upgrade their fleets to more fuel efficient aircraft/expand it. Nuclear is also getting a boost under biden. Think i might go for all tbh. Vestas, siemens, GE and TPI, which allows the big guys to outsource the manufacturing of the blades. GE i think bought their competitor recently which worried investors until they increased their order. Orsted may also have a great run as they have plans to expand into the us market significantly, which is currently untapped. Their is too much choice, just need to buy the dip correctly as i see increased net income for all, but analysts have said they will go down in 21 which I disagree with.

You guys do realize that days to cover is based on average daily volume right? So if the stock is trading, say 10x average daily volume, it would mean less days to cover.

Precisely. If she wants the D, give it to her nice.
Yeah, these margin calls seem to affect retail and predominantly then long positions a lot more. So I'm not sure I get it. Maybe retail broker margins are somehow indicative of similar behavior at the higher levels?
Kinda feel the same way
I was at +40% for the year until today knocked me down to 35. I started with less than $500 and and hoping to just find momentum plays to capitalize on. So far I've won on PLUG, GME, MARA, and IRDM. I sold PLUG at $38 right before it dropped back to 30 then mooned but I don't care. I have my strategy and I stick to it. Basic math tells me it will work if I stay disciplined and make the right decisons
Take a look at that call and see what the break even price is. The 9.50 is the minimum it needs to be for you to make any money, but the break even price is where it needs to be for you to make up the premium you paid and anything you get after that is profit.

Calls closer to the actual stock price like you got are closer to buying actual shares. Buying ones with higher strike prices gives you more leverage in the sense of you can get a lot more calls and upside for the same amount of money, but with a higher chance they are worthless. It’s a spectrum of risk/reward.

I don’t have too much experience, but this past week I went up 100% on my portfolio by buying leaps on companies I thought were undervalued. Leaps are long expirations calls. Like 6+ months. So they cost more, but they also hold their value longer which I like in case things don’t go as planned. I got blackberry as well

The guys that you see making gain porn are the retards that made calls with short expirations at huge unrealistic call prices that actually hit. That’s how you see that happen and it’s rare

Can we change our limit to sell at 900.01? 420.69 feels like a Tesla thing. Ryan Cohen is a DBZ fan.
That is because if the strike price is much lower than the current price of the stock, you have better chances of profiting or at least breaking even. Those contracts are called “in the money”. If the strike price is higher than the current price it’s called “out of the money”. When it’s out of the money you need to hope and count on the stock going up a ton more and therefore it’s more risky so it’s cheaper. There are a ton of things to consider which I can’t go into depth here but I recommend checking YouTube for more explanation. Good luck!
Totally agree.  Someone mentioned in another post that the reason its been hovering around $26 is because the Lockup Expiration is already priced in which makes sense.

Doesn't matter whether it's a physical or a downloadable product. In the end what matters for the business is what makes it money. 

How do you make money in GameStop? It's not easy, but if you're a gamer like you say you are then you know the potential in this industry is there and it's growing more than ever before. Lots of untapped opportunities. You're right it's not easy, but that's exactly where Ryan Cohen with his experience comes in and that's why this won't go tits up.

When you’re older, you’re more risk averse because you have more responsibilities so consequences of losses are far greater. Also, you have more capital to invest so slight movements are still pretty profitable so you don’t even need to resort to yoloing to make good profit. If you’re investing 2 million and make only 10%, you’re still up 170k a year after long-term capital gains. Most people who are investing probably have a job that pays six figures so they don’t really need more money than that. Just to explain that it’s not entirely being a total pussy why older people don’t just yolo
Yeah I sold off 100k of my favorite bestest holding today because I'm up bigly in it and I felt it was proper to take some off and stash if there's a big dip. I will not be pissed if it moons in the short term. Pigs get slaughtered.
I did the math and a 15 minute dump every working day of the year (assuming 1 week off a year) correlates to $1,200 a year. Food for thought.

I made 40% of my account this month.  I didn't do anything egregious- no TSLA, no GME, no PLUG.  I got lucky, and I know 40% isn't sustainable, but I want to have 100k in my account in 6 years.  I'm at 4k.  I think it might be reachable.
Nah just massively overvalued

The fall by 10% triggered the halt on short selling (Rule 201) Selling shares to step down is bullish. Board needs a 360 and to be woken up.

Haha, yeah I got about 17k in shares. I’d consider trying something else, but I honestly have no idea how options, futures, calls or any of that stuff works and my internet is too bad to watch YouTube videos about it, and reading sucks.
they're instruments all the same, hold them for over a year and you pay long term cap gains.

I hate to admit it, but at this point its a very legitimate concern. Fund with billions vs a bunch of retards. Melvin can hold until they get margin called. We need Lord Cohen to announce something huge and soon.

We had a record day last week and this is the profit taking
i see this mentioned is so many threads, but wouldn't the sword cut both ways?

obviously shorts were in trouble, as the price was flying and they were getting margin called

but now with all you retards who are all in leveraged to the tits, wouldn't this cause liquidations of longs as well?

my understanding is margin requirement increase will hurt the more leveraged side, right now i don't know a single person who's all in short GME, but can probably pull up a hundred in the next hour who are all in long

interactive brokers had no shares to short for a long time, today i see over 1 million available to short, i'd be careful counting on this margin change as super bullish
Just bought another 2.5k 

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
So the idea is we need to exercise our options to force the shorts to cover right?
You ain't helping anyone with this link lol.
No that is not what the number mean stop replying to everyone with that link.
It goes by the last trade.  If you are buying, the price is the offer price.  If you are bidding you are buying at the bid and need to get in line and wait for someone to sell to you.  Vice versa with selling/offering.
I actually don't know, and just watch the pretty numbers scroll on the screen, but isn't it the last price?

The most retarded thing about this is that they made tons of money shorting it to nearly $2.50/share until the covid monetary response. They go all in on a potential bankruptcy instead. Then do it again after a a better than expected quarter still. Then do it again when they get fresh new board members with vision. 

The likes of Melvin do not deserve to get out of this one. I see this as example of how deep pockets of Wall Street think they can never be wrong and believe throwing enough money at anything can fix their greedy mistakes. Screw Melvin Capital!
Well I’m drunk, pretty butthurt I lost 28% on BB today. Hopefully Tuesday is better.
Melatonin.

The sellers are looking at the past. We’re looking towards the future.

GME has a good platform that can grow. The previous board members sucked. With the new ones now included, who are experts in todays e-world, GME can have a great comeback if they play everything correctly.

All in. Will be buying more on Tuesday.
Always sell before. Remember last time big tech reported earnings. AAPL, MSFT, and FB killed it but their stock prices still went down. Don’t think much will change this upcoming earnings. If you have a couple calls you can sell a majority of them and let a few run but just be careful.
Yeah I got 20-30% of my portfolio tied up in US MSOs. I’m really bullish on the big 4
So youre playing shares? They always bore me cause I’m playing w $4k, options is much more thrilling.

However, funnt story I actually started my investing journey with 107 shares of APHA @ 5.50, held and sold at ~8 a few months ago. Then I played a bunch of meme stocks and on Monday decided to get into APHA leaps. Best decision of the year so far 😂
Nope. Just set the stop. Ill decide when to sell

Edit: AND I AINT SELLIN 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Very retarded question but if there are two prices for a stock (the bid price and the ask price) how is the price of a share determined?

By that I mean how is the actual price of the share determined for the ticker symbol. Is it the average between the bid and the ask price?

It makes extremely little difference but I'm curious
I'm like 90/10 ratio shares to options my dude. I make nice gains with mostly shares. You can still hit all of the spec tickers with shares, gains arent as high as options but risk I'd also much lower. Just depends on what you're comfortable with
If I used trailing stop loss’s It would of absolutely crippled the account I have today. I would be nowhere near where I am at. I respectfully disagree.
Also edit: screw Melvin
Its a dump scheme by Melvin and we're just fucking them over, having 💎🙌 isn't illegal
Being that margin restrictions on GME will affect longs also, anyone have any idea what kind of a result we'd be looking at?
Yeah I’m thinking I need to jump back in on this on Tuesday. I seen my first 10 bagger slipping through my fingers so I dumped my 3/19 10c. May look for leaps and shares
Sooooo mad GME buying on Tuesday to blow up the short interest %???

I still has 50 shares since the spac day
The idea is obv again to eventually sell, but just not now. Not before at the absolute very least $50. Obviously some will lose out on some gains by holding too long but again these numbers should be fairly huge compared to our entry prices and when it does crash, it doesn't completely crash (VW didnt) to zero. So its a matter of greed and timing. But again, the entire point is that this isn't normal market trading. MELVIN PAYS US THESE PRICES because they owe the shares back to whoever bought them. We compete with each other for who gets to suck most of their blood. But all this extraneous value is coming from them not from people who came in late and bought and held too long. You get me? That's why everyone is so hard for this play.

Apparently part of the sell off today was China announcing lockdowns. China's lockdown will be over quick though, only 109 cases a day. Span that over 14 days, the average infection period, they just need to kill 1500 people or so.

I agree with your thesis though, MMs always fuck over options on the high volume options dates. 03/19/21 04/16/21 06/18/21 are probably the next big days to avoid.
No idea?
My guess is more than that due to tax advantages people at this level probably receive.

Last summer, I approached the miserable fuckhead in the street, and asked him for his autograph, because my son is a huge fan. The fucking bitch gave me the autograph and told me to burn in hell. Later, when I gave my son the autograph he started crying and said he hated me. Turns out the motherfucker didnt write his autograph, no, he wrote “you’re a piece of shit, and i fucked your mom”. I’m now divorced, and planning a huge class-action lawsuit against the white devil that ruined my life. Your time is almost over, Melvin. All the people you’ve wronged will rise against you.

GME $300 EOM 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀
Daddy Cohen need to drop his King Kong dong on the shorts face and get do a stock buyback. Drive that price up and the shorts will be lefucked up to their eyeballs in that oooey gooey red.

Damn I haven’t hit all week and up Fuking lit
Been so busy with work today that I didn't even pay too much attention to my portfolio. Wtf happened today?
So do i buy gme tuesday morning or wait for the dip?
Yeah. Benadryl helps but it’s still rough
Haha no it’s more so tinkering around on Fidelity learning the ins and outs. When I first pulled up the option chain I was like uhhh...
Officially - $420.69
What if Melvin refuses to cover because he knows the market is gonna crash soon?
Ahhh yes I remember reading about that once. Thank you for the tip. I'll add those dates to my calendar in preparation

Explain pls?
Hey well if you are a 🤡I am too, 1/22 11.5c and praying. Haven’t lost all hope yet why have you
DIAMOND LONG TERM HANDS.

Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow, wow. 

What was your thought process? I mean, IV hasn't set in it seems and this was pre split, so you only bought 10 at $1.50 so, $1500 was your cost back in 2019.

Wow. congrats! and of course the obligatory, F\*ck you!
WAIT where do you live? SoCal here and my allergies literally started yesterday. Fuck allergy season

thanks i appreciate the info..so why is it that when buying calls the lower the strike price like below the share price the more expensive the premium is?

Thanks Dad, more unsolicited advice. Can I borrow the keys to the wagon now?
So do i buy tuesday morning or wait for a dip?
Probably less depressed than losing 35% of your portfolio in one day
It means we’re mooning to planet Tendie
Might not be a dip. Short selling suspended by the SEC
If you're new, please don't buy into GME hype.

This is highly speculative and unless you have cash to lose, don't do it.
:( allergies in the winter?
What do you think would trigger such a dip before rocketing? Thx
Proud to see 1.9 M as opposed to 1.8 M !! Means we are multiplying 😈😈😈

I’m one sell away from that happening, are you FULLY suspended? can’t even buy or sell AT ALL or just same day?

Don’t be a cock tease, now. My undies are soaked with precum.
We chillin, looking at the trade volume has got me thinking about doubling down on some calls.
You should set up a website that shows this information. Sell some ad space to make some extra tendies. I'd check it often
I’m Melvin. You caught me.
that's some srious diamond hands you got
this makes me feel better, thanks^  🚀
For me long term is about 3-6 months on this. My strategy is to compound my portfolio at 10% a month. I might keep some shares as a side bet for GME but I'm not waiting forever. Plenty of plays out there to make a quick 10% and gtfo and leave someone else holding the momentum bag
Same it adds up in the long term
Fuck them, they can get in their super nice cars and huge houses and eat shit. Fucking galactic ride through space with Stephen Hawkings ghost laughing and counting money. Fuck with us!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

It's an option, its in the name. There's something called obligations, those are indeed obligations to buy or sell
Good bot
If you were here since last week, it should be gme, bb or pltr. Tesla wasn't talked about for two weeks already
What’s your position? Hopefully Tuesday better, if not I may sell;(

I really wonder how the markets gonna play out on Tuesday. I mean obviously we have no clue but I can think of reasons for it to go both up and down :/ my calls no likey
I have a dream, that one day, PLUG and ENPH will go up at the same time, that my ICLN calls won't drill. I have a dream.
Better get a wheelbarrow for all his pennys 🤡
I’m thinking about buying $57 2/5 calls at open Tuesday. Bad idea? Also holding shares

I’d heard they were working on a profit-sharing scheme with Microsoft. Or something. I’m fuzzy on the details.

The idea being that making deals with console manufactures is the only way brick-and mortar game stores are going to stay open. Manufacturers want them to stay open too, because while their profits are low compared to online sales, in-person stores are where community events happen, and it draws new people into gaming that otherwise are hard to advertise to.

But all that being said, any company that has to drink from the teat of its own product’s manufacturers just to stay afloat is at-a-minimum unprofitable, and more than likely doomed to fail.

Ten years from now, if my guess is right, gamestop will either be gone or jointly owned my Microsoft and Sony. Maybe even Nintendo.
Uh oh, stinky
So fucking good. A24 is the best studio out there right now

10c -> call option at a strike price of $10 which means you need BB to reach that price before the expiration date on the contract PLUS what ever premium you paid. If you paid a $3 premium then you need BB to reach $13 to at least break even. The cost of the contract is premium price x 100 so for my example that single contract would cost $300. Do some more research before you get into options because you can lose money fast and easy.
Thats all you can really ask for in a marriage, and if thats actually your wife congrats on locking that down lol

Do you guys ever roll your calls out if you’re bearish short term and bullish long term?

I been spending too much on doordash and delicious steak and lobster. I'm thinking about swapping to ramen so I can buy more calls.
Does Spy chart look like it's about to fall off a cliff to anyone else?
Okay very nice, you have a small number of shareholders all clutching tightly and waiting for the number to rise. Then what? Who the fuck is buying into a stock at such a ridiculously high price? This is the side I don't think anyone wants to admit. Once the curve starts arcing downwards, if you're still on the rollercoaster you're going all the way down.
For people who get paid sick days, remember to take one off every now and then and just chill. Its glorious

Buy some shares
Motherfuck you! Nice shit
I'm buying one share just to say I participated in this piece of history.
I’d appreciate if anyone would give me a good answer because I don’t wanna miss the short squeeze, but I’m holding 2 contracts and some shares in GME, should I just buy shares and sell the contracts and buy more shares? When is the share price expected to peak? Will I still have time to open some positions on Tuesday morning? Thank you to whoever responds to me.
Someone teach me how I can make more money in the shortest time possible in the stock market so I can buy more GME shares.
No corn is back
All you gotta know with calls and puts is that every cent that a stock is over the strike price by (call) or under the strike price by (put), you make a dollar. And never hold until expiration. Always sell beforehand. Also, when an option is ".67" is actually 67 dollars. Multiply the price it shows by 100, because an options contract is for 100 shares
Haha 8/10 body, 9.5 bro
She’s fucking other dudes or is a lesbo bro
Eh I don’t mean today just in general, but yea I skip that because it’s just meant to be breadcrumbs for the 10% of autists keepin it trill in here who will still be around after this next washout.
Fer sure, I just looked their YoY history, seems sturdy, but yep anything can happen
52 million shares were shorted and not covered on Friday lolololol
Holy shit. Anf I thought I was retarded to buy BB at $10.50.

Ya I think it was your dd.  Picked them up 12/23.  500@11.83
God damn it this brought back memories I'd rather forget
I'm not sure you understand the elimination of margin.  That's not a positive.

That decreases the marginable value of GME shares to zero.  Meaning you can't use your GME shares to buy more GME shares.

Same thing happened with Tesla when the short losses grew large.  It's big money investors using their relationships with brokerages to force you to sell shares to them.

It only hurts longs.  And helps shorts immensely.
Yeah, but they weren’t expensive at that time. That’s my point
You can afford food?
So find a stock with huge amount of options expiring soon that MM need to hedge Delta on. When it pops sell. Got it

221,084% gains is 100% luck. If you think it’s anything else, you’re retarded, or a gambling addict. Fortunately for you, you’re both, and you’re in the right place.
How tight are they. I hold shares but also some stupid 40C 1/22 $5 calls that might be worthless if this takes more than next week. Calls right now are expensive because of all the volatility so theyre not the best. But there is a big chance for some action next week.
Shit. Lucky. Did he exercise or sell the contracts?
Just to verify, Does long mean it’s a long term cap gain or long as in it’s a long call option?

I think pc hardware, gaming mouses/headsets and whatnot, funko-pops (geeky stuff), consoles. Things where if you’re ordering it off Amazon you wonder about whether you’re getting a knock off product. 

Also just used games that people would pay a premium for. I’m not that into gaming but a market definitely exists for an online GameStop that isn’t just digital sales through things like PSN.

Yea I totally get how the short squeeze is working. What I don't get is why everyone is assuming everyone is gonna get a massive gain. Those WSB people with mega diamond hands will get thrown under the bus right because GameStop will literally not be worth whatever insane price it will be after the squeeze. After this whole thing the price has to come down at some point.

All I'm saying is some of us on here will be losing money. Right? Not all of us can get those gains. It doesn't make sense to me.

This is the way
Lemme ask this, I have an m1 account too. Is it worth it to buy GME there too? I ask because you can’t sell but once a day on that app. So I wouldn’t be able to sell. I guess I’m saying, when this thing peaks is it gonna stay super high over the course of multiple days giving me the chance to sell in m1 at a high price as well? Or should I stick to buying in fidelity only?

The reality is ENPH is worth more than $200, and TSLA using their own inverter internally won't likely change that. I bought the dip when it hit $189, and will buy more if it's red again on Tuesday.

After inauguration, all solar stonks will be likely to surge.

Not gonna lie.. same. I can barely tell a share from an option. I don't know shit. I see a post with conviction and🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 and i buy stonks.
It'd be whole lot cooler if it was gme
He paid .31 $ not 1.55. And even that couldn’t be available if he had expiry 2 years out.
WSB is not a good place to skip steps in explaining this. Price => yield => discount rate => value

Even then this is not really why things trended lower today, as yields headed back down somewhat. Uncertainty over mango and Rona played a way bigger part
I don't get it. He says $12/month (not $2) but in the comments mentions $60/week.
i was female last i checked
Not even a few 🚀🚀🚀 or 💎 in the post? Mods where's the ban?

WSB etf incoming, where the fund will hold 90% of whatever the trending stock of the day is, and 10% in the one that trended yesterday that has not sold yet, and the other 20% (we can borrow against ourselves right )in fang, tsla, msft cus something something diversity?

I hope you’re right Dan baby. ;*
Holy shit, I said the same thing...I think it means with have a gambling problem
Always has been imo
Most of us are playing the short squeeze but honestly with how cyclical this stock is in consoles cycles I could see it being between 30-45 realistically. Then if Ryan Cohen is right look out.

Sounds Midwestern, in any case I don't think I want it
While I’m drunk, I’m still buzzin off gains. Dr King would have wanted Monday trade days
We need palantir to do such a task so NO
i’m setting my GME limit sell order to $419 because i know how big the fucking sell off is gonna be at $420.69
Think about how you would reply if you saw someone else write this.
I hope you got a divorce lawyer ready. Does no one here remember what happened with Palantir like 2 months ago? Everyone on here was onto it and it nose-dived.
How do you think they covered exactly? There is a theory that they may have exercised a lot of barely ITM calls to buy back some now and take a hit, but the volume supposedly doesn't check out. They'd need something like 100,000 calls a day for like 3-4 days (all at the CURRENT market price) and lose some on the premiums as well but not a significant amount compared to the squeeze obv. This operation would def be noticed and would raise the price either way. No way it went down on Wednesday. The out tho however is them just rolling their shorts over by investing more and hoping we paper hand.
And I cant go to the bar and get drunk to fuck a bar slut... cause covid smh

Can someone smarter than me make a poll to see how many shares of GME all the autists in WSB owns. Would be interesting to see how much of the company we actually have.
All in December.
Ok but you'll have the money to declare it an enchilada
This is a 🚨PSA🚨 to all newbie traders 

If the selling does not abate do not panic. Decide where you will get out _now_ and stick to the plan. Consider taking some gains off if you have large gains.
Any potential news next week?
Anxiety attack the whole time
This is so retarded it smells like tater tots and KMart boxers...
Just sold everything, no reason it should be this high.
How long is long term in this sense?  A year?
BB is going to fucking print bros
That’s kinda fire tf
It sounds like you've got the idea. If everyone is forced to sell off then the price drops. 01/15 was a very popular exp date. I'm currently searching for the next one. So that next time I can sell my shares before I miss the opportunity
[removed]
Go to a non volatile stock like Walmart. 52% break even OTM one year out is $1.07. Two years out with 54% break even is $3.90 Easy to see how on a red day a 15 month call 50% OTM could be selling for $1.50-2.50.

What do you mean by lock them up at 420 each? Like an automatic sell when the stock reaches 420? Why wouldn’t you just wait for the peak and then sell?
Not bad but barchart sucks, especially the free version. It’s really time delayed. If it’s something you really want to do pay for flowalgo, cheddar, or blackbox. If you get 1 early entry a month it pays for itself. It’s also way more organized identifying sweeps, blocks, and bonus you get dark and lit pool share orders. It can also put together spread plays and pair up hedges. Takes out all of you manual labor. Also there’s services out there that can identify what’s retail, institution, and algo buying so you have a better idea. Follow @darkpoolcharts on Twitter

Yeah and it doesn’t work lol. ETFS go up and down based on the movement of the holdings. You can “pump” or “dump” them to some extent but they will always return to NAV pretty fast. 

WSB is pushing ICLN and ARK because they have been doing really well and hold meme stocks which makes them attractive to the more risk adverse crowd

DFV is a savage value investor, not a gambler. This was not slots. It was an 18 month play that began in June 2019 and involved speculation, but nothing like some of the insanity that takes place on here. DFV had a well-thought out intelligent thesis that turned into an epic saga which continues to this day. Check out his YouTube channel Roaring Kitty to learn more from him.
I agree. We are over 100% shorted of shares outstanding but people are treating this like it’s new news. It’s been about 300% of the actual float for months. 69 million shares outstanding 71 million short
A call is covered if you already have the underlying shares or buy them if you wrote cash 

So if you had 100 shares of tesla you can write a single contract on them with a date/strike and set a premium to sell. That's covered by your shares in case it gets excercised and you get assigned to fill the contract. Your shares get sold to the buyer. 

If you wrote a naked call then you secured it with your cash balance or other collateral (other shares) which then is used to buy shares on the open market.

The drop I think is good - if it dropped more I’d be sad like I was in October, November and December - it established a support going forward.  It’s all set up.

That's the thing, not everyone knows, believes, or is on the same side of the squeeze to jump in. That's literally what this is all about. If some big players came in on our side, doubt any would early on (but dont worry they'll scalp our work either way on the way up), it would be a big catalyst. I assume maybe it isn't within big player's risk tolerances or insiders have sometimes interests amongst them.

Yeah. Let’s see. If IV stays the same, I expect $35c 2/19 to go by about $1.4. However, this mine approval could have been considered a binary event - it was known and it was “priced into” the high IV, so given the big move, it’s completely possible that we see a bit of an IV crush. If that happens, I expect 2/19 $35 calls to go for under 1$.

Still, probably free money. She’s hardly gonna jump by 50% in a month.

Hey wait how can you trade stocks with your silly little Monopoly money?

Yeah. I agree. I sold my shares just before the squeeze. It was really bad timing. If I held just a day longer would have made $5500. Whatever 🤷‍♂️ I never trusted in the company.
so are my 2 calls worthless then?
The world might have ended, but for beautiful moment, we squeezed the *FUCK* out of those shorts
If the squeeze stays off another month or so I'll have more to dump into it. If it really starts moving maybe I sell my other calls and buy more gme stonks. Well see. Thanks for the insight though.

One. Fucking. Day. Seriously. One day, which happened to be a red day across nearly every sector, which happened to be the monthly options expiration day with market makers determined to have the price be pegged hard above $35 but below $40 so that the overwhelming majority of options would expire worthless. 

One day and shit like this gets posted.

The price just has to stay above like $25. The one things that’s also nice about buying shares is even if this fails, it’s not a bad long term investment. I think today was going to be the indicator. People thought it was going into the 20s.

But holy shit if we can get the collective focus concentrated for one more week.. I’m sure some funds will pitch in because they know what’s happening.

thats still wrong. ill try to explain:

wolf has a fund: hestia capital. of his total holdings (just an example) gme was 10%. now gme rises to 20+, maybe other holdings lose value, so now his gme is 15% of his total holdings. the rules of his fund now apply, because there is a restriction that he cant own more than 10% of his holdings in one stock.

numbers are just examples and not the correct ones.

It was a 70% margin requirement before. Worst case, we have to sell 30% of our position. Realistically it's less than that. The shorts have to close something like 130% of their position.

I wouldn't be too worried, it's just annoying (and interesting) to see shit go down that I didn't think was possible.
Short sellers saw the uptrend and thought to themselves “it got to go down eventually 😂😂😂😂” I don’t feel bad for them at all they thought they saw a opportunity like some sharks and fucked around and got drowned fuck them

Sorry, almost forgot, TLDR: GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Exactly that. They have deep pockets. And the way they keep the stock down is by shorting more stock, which if they succeed in paper handing us all pays out back to them at the lowest price at the end. Only difference is we dont pay premiums on hold shares we bought, so its their premiums running vs. our ability to not break. It's a psychology/sentiment play at this point now that everyone is aware of the finances.

No need, they feel bad for themselves.
Except all data is showing that shorts have NOT covered. In fact, short positions have risen over the past few days. 

Not sure thats all from institutions doubling down either. I think theres a lot of new retail shorts who are going off of historical charts and inaccurate boomer financial news sources who are about to get their faces ripped off when institutions start covering.

my honest opinion? suprised it held in today. if you got shares under $20 then i would hold. anything over that you might look to take profits / cut losses. stocks arnt made to jump that high, even in squeezes. we had our entire reddit pushing so that helped. but people who are smart have already taken profits, and they only people pumping GME are those who bought in late and are only seeing red.

Anyways, can someone with more than a few brain wrinkles explain how institutions and insiders can own more than 100% of the float, if you look on their website they own all own 70 million
You guys keep asking what the gme price target is
 That literally depends on If we hold the shares.

If we all collectively agree to set a limit order at 420$, then that's the PT

There’s nothing wrong with putting all eggs in a basket, just make sure it’s a good basket!
Fucking gay mods remove this?
I hope so. I was actually pleasantly surprised we only dropped 12% or so today. I thought today would be a total bloodbath for us. This stock has me feeling so alive. So fucking glad I laughed at the retards when I heard GameStop, then actually did some DD myself and realized these helmet-wearers were right
This is the way
Gme is done. Selling his shares cos he knows it.
They're trying to scare people aware from buying more shares so they don't keep losing money on their shorts. It's all posturing, they're bleeding money. The more shares we buy the more shorts they lose then we go to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀
So basically buy GME, PLTR, and TSLA? 🚀🚀🚀
Funny, I’ve lost more karma in 30 minute than you idiots have in dollars in your brokerage account
I really do think they're going to make a comeback.
How dare you disrespect DFV and his 7 million gains
Fundamentals wont matter if there is a short squeeze

I don’t buy the whole “attractive in their time” argument either.
U can afford plates
They increased the amount of shorts to artificially push the price down, dug themselves a deeper hole that will make the tendies even meatier when the cards fall. They are trying to win by mind games and spiraling down the weak hands. It’s literally a math equation that has a time limit of 2 weeks but each day it costs more for them to hold and the higher the stock goes the more it costs to hold the margin.

They tried to bluff today. They don’t get how retarded we are. So buy shares since they won’t expire and they take up supply which demand has to buy
Gonna suck when you go to sell and they only give you about $1.40 in store credit
he totally yolo it. He bought call options of a strike price of $138 on oct 2019. If you look at the price of tesla stock on oct 2019 it was like $62 which means he was predicting in the time period of 14 months that the stock would be worth $138 which is crazy because tesla stock never reached that level ever (hindsight is 20/20 since no one predicted tesla stock price would skyrocket to fucking $826 which resulted in this user making out as a bandit and becoming a millionaire). In reality, no one would ever buy call/put options with strike prices that are double what there the current value of the stock is when they were buying because its guaranteed you will loose all your investments since no one can predict that tesla stocks would double let alone quadtriple times their worth. He just yolo and it worked out.

What y’all think about me adding 2000 shares of BB rn 🤷🏽‍♂️
Never give in & Never give up!🔥
If people own shares on margin and suddenly they’re under the margin requirement.. that would potentially become a margin call and cause them to liquidate a portion of their holdings to be under the limit
There’s definitely a correction coming for the overall market in the next couple wks.  But I think GME will be ok if the short squeeze is on.
Lol I was jk man. I just like to post such random senseless comments giving GME shillers false hope 😂

Btw, out of curiosity, do you think the squeeze is done for and it will fall now (really curious)?
Godspeed retard

anyone know if $X will fly again?
Just don't let the tips touch whilst buried in Smelvin's chocolate pie and you're good!
They just downgraded PLTR too. Inverse CITI for easy gains.
Are t ,
Nice. I'll google them. We get some military funding, but its a pain to spend.
Mona Lisa is fucking ugly
that attitude is why we will win
Don’t even need news anymore as long as we can maintain 30s+ word on the street margin calls are on the way. We’re in the endgame now
