The problem with your thesis is the false premise that wsb caused the spike and volume that occurred during last week. Do you really think that was WSB? We've been long gme for weeks. It was new money that poured in, and I don't think they're selling after one week...

[removed]
Why would you put a stop loss on GME if you're anticipating the squeeze, that's just asking to get fucked. You want as much stock as cheap as possible before the squeeze, you're just hedging your bets on whether it would dip before squeezing or squeezing immediately by splitting up the price you buy the stock at once and how much of your portfolio you allocate.
Technically, it's the subreddits' way...

Best of luck, this should be a decent investment.
Yooo was just a question

For what it’s worth to you, every time I’ve been in a position of “I have to win on this trade...or else...” then I have lost probably 95% of the time.  I lost $30K overnight one time on a defense company, I’ve blown up 3 accounts, and when I paper hand options-  I just lose.  I literally ask myself before I buy any option: “Are you ok with lighting $X,XXX.XX on fire right now?” If the answer is no, then don’t do it.  Having the discipline to not cut a $3K loss on AAPL with 2 weeks left before expiry can get tough, but you were already prepared to light it on fire anyway, so what is the rub?  To win in this game, you almost have to not care about the money... It sounds crazy, but guys here will know what I mean.  In the recent past I was in a situation with seemingly unsurmountable debt- credit cards, cars, mortgage, taxes, business pressures, etc.  To make it worse, how it happened was completely out my control, life just happened.  I got pissed enough one day because I got a 3 way screwing out of a deal that would make a lot of stuff come together for me, so I woke up the next day and vowed that would never happen again. I started a second business that had a minuscule overhead, I already had a working customer base and put some relationships in play with the sole goal out of that business was to pay down debt.  Pandemic hit 3 months in, but the fight kept on.  Now, 14 months into the additional venture- credit card is gone (1 really high balance card), highest cost car is paid off, and all additional assets (besides mortgage) are mine.

I tell you that story because I want you to know that if you give it all you got- there is a way out.  This is the United States of America- assuming you are an American- and every day is a new chance for you to decide when you wake up, if you are going to fight that day or not.  You just have to chose to not give up.

I swore off trading 3 other times, and gave it up for a good few years, but here I am... I have more $$$ now in my trading account than I probably should keep in it, but I came back with one difference this time... I wasn’t desperate and had a completely different outlook this time than I did all the other times.

Go fight. Get up every day and make a conscious choice that you are going to fight that day. Go get out of credit card debt, pinch pennies, and do what you gotta do to break those shackles.  When you do, you will come back a completely new person, because you WILL NOT BE DESPERATE.

You’ll be back OP. We’ll see you here again.  It won’t be today, and may not be tomorrow, but we’ll see you again... Until then- go fight- and make a conscious choice to fight and get through it. I sincerely and truly wish you the best on journey and wish the absolute best of luck.  We’ll be here when your really ready for 💎🤲🏻.  Godspeed OP.

I actually like the trade IF the bought calls were were more short term. What I don’t understand is that he’s buying and selling (more selling than buying) for the same July period.
How is that bullish for stocks? Isn’t a weak dollar good for stocks?

If a guy tried to get me to come over to his the night after one date I'd assume he was just in it for the sex. If he stopped talking to me immediately after I declined his proposition that would confirm it.

A lot of this has been factored in, and CEO has until 2023 for the SP to accrue $30.
Stop this shit.
A few things to consider: 
1. Amazon is going to report Q4 Earnings 100+ Billion. 
2. The e-tail giant delivered more than 1.5 billion toys, home products, beauty and personal care products, and electronics worldwide this holiday. Independent businesses selling on Amazon, nearly all of which are small-and-medium-sized businesses, saw worldwide sales grow over 50% compared to the same time period in 2019. During the holiday season, U.S. small- and medium-sized businesses sold nearly 1 billion products in Amazon’s store.
Amazon’s holiday deliveries included over 8 million items shipped to alternative delivery locations, including Amazon Hub lockers and Amazon physical retail stores like Amazon 4-star and Amazon Books.
3. PRIME DAY is included in Q4 earnings as date was moved up from Q3. 
4. Last but not lease, Don Bezos & Don Elon are in a battle for galactic planets 🪐🚀 🚀 🚀 🪐

Why the fuck is a fumble out of bounds in the end zone an automatic turnover?? Browns got fucked today
Yeah they do have options, but it would definitely be a long term hold for me. I feel like Canada is about to make big moves.
BUY SHARES AND HOLD!
My rule is 300%
only way I’m selling is when we reach 420.69
Oooh how did that happen?

True

They are super condescending over there. Honestly WSB is way more welcoming amd accepting. Even when people tell me I'm a fucking autistic retard that should kill myself in my parents basement, its said with real love here!
mkt not open monday, bearish
They’re at 1B+ valuation for just their Cybersecurity division? They’re projected to double their current EPS this year. This hasn’t even priced in the revenue from the FB settlement. Nah, bro. I’m pretty sure you don’t know. But, again. To each his own.
If it dips further I’ll probably buy more.
Oh I know that’s why I’m tryna go there lol. At least for a weekend place or something in mountain life
Is TSLA really worth more than all automakers combined with sales/profits only making up a very very limited portion of the industry?
I hope so too lol. Just to be clear I know absolutely nothing I’ve just noticed that the market never acts the way you think it should. I think it should plummet this week which is why I loaded up on calls. It seems to have been the way to go in the past.
Or buy LEAPS and average down as time goes on
Stocks *always* move on individual gut feelings. You must be right.
Holy shit this just blew my mind realizing she was the VA of Lizzy Wizzy in Cyberpunk 2077.  I looked it up a while back and was like who the fuck is Grimes.  Didnt realize it was Elons wife.
If you sell calls you are actually causing selling by the dealer when you sell them, then buying in opposition to whatever they sold when they roll off the mm’s book.
Congrats on bumfucking yourself. You're a natural.

I feel bad for you bro, the sub decided you have to be the one to shit on 😂 look at the comment votes
True, but you’re currently on a sub that bans for talking about spacs or sub-billi market caps, if theyre going to enforce retarded rules might as well weed out the actual annoying people.

>think having apposing political views is a great thing for a country but man I genuinely want to know what happened to the Republican Party in the past ten or so years, people like you just kind of confirm you guys have really lost your way, you aren’t even conservative anymore in most cases and base everything on hate and fear mongering

This is rich coming from a liberal. What happened to you? You're not even LIBERAL anymore, like you know, believing in freedom. The Republican party fell off? Really? Twitter and Reddit degenerates have been totally mentally fucked by Trump. Your party is vastly different from 20 years ago. I don't have a genuine comeback? Can you fucking read? Dipshit there's no arguing with someone who fakes being for free speech and can't even make a decent argument
I bought a lot of my components from Newegg when I built my gaming rig.  They don't have any physical stores though to my knowledge.  There's going to be plenty of competition, but not much if you're looking for a brick and mortar experience.

But if a lot of them manage to cover 
Our squeeze won’t be that big or we’ll get fucked
Some may have closed their shorts but watching available shorted shares and borrow rates skyrocketing was a pretty clear sign it wasn’t happening. 

Then the SEC enacted the uptick rule and shorters backed off. 

Guess we won’t know for sure until next week or the week after. 

We’ll see
This might come as a surprise but retail is only 20% of the market. And wsb is probably not even a whole 1% of retail. It was the institution’s/bull market run up from the stimulus bills that made those go up.

They weren’t based on this reality, but they were based on the reality you were talking about, that is what would happen if there was true complete free speech. It’s not even a straw man it’s just that you made such a terrible argument my easy response looks like a strawman

If it’s a straw man, which by definition is a weak attack on the argument, you should easily be able to shift your argument so the straw man doesn’t exist.

So come up with a way to frame absolute free speech, that doesn’t allow serial killers and nazis to meet.

If you can’t frame it that way then that’s what you’re advocating for, let that one marinate
Ew
Philly ain’t cheap
No it's not! It's gross!
this assuming you have a house already?
I don't know the facts on this, just curious. 

But isn't it possible that most of the institutions closed their short positions when it skyrocketed, and then simply re-shorted when it was at a high of $40? Trading volume was double the amount of the outstanding shares that day so I feel like this was easily achievable. 

Unless the people on this sub know for A FACT that no one closed their prior short positions, isn't everyone talking out their ass here? Someone please educate me if I'm wrong

QNX is currently in use and a part of revenue. You’re probably thinking of IVY. EVs are pushing harder to bring vehicles to market and will need to have this aspect of Autonomous and AI machine learning solidified which relies on QNX and eventually IVY. This year will witness aggressive regulations pushed and incentives on alternative energy. BB is also much more than an automotive focused company. They are used by quite a few governments for Cybersecurity and AtHoc for emergency management. They’ve made a full transition from their previous business model. I’m safe to say that you’ve not really done much DD other than read a couple of articles and made a quick assumption. But, to each his own.

 An April survey for Forbes Advisor by YouGov.com revealed that 35% of adult [planned to use the money to pay bills](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/personal-finance/survey-one-third-of-americans-plan-to-use-stimulus-checks-to-pay-bills/), while 18% said they’d put the money into their emergency savings fund. Sixteen percent said they’d put the cash toward essentials, with another 8% planning to put the money toward debts. Those results were similar to a May survey for Forbes Advisor that revealed 30% of adults [paid bills with their stimulus checks](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/personal-finance/heres-how-americans-are-using-their-stimulus-checks/), while 14% put the money toward emergency savings.

It looks as though you may have spelled "Chick-fil-A" incorrectly. No worries, it happens to the best of us!
Ok but WHY buy BB
Yeah I’m not against waiting longer, think a mid March EXP is safe though given what I’ve been seeing.
So look at whatever you are going to get when those calls are exercised. Now I want you to add 100 to share price at that very moment. Having calls in GME is going to lose you a lot of potential money for a small profit.
Yeah it kills me I’ll probably never own a dog because I love just packing up and going to Bali for 3 months
Lol idiot
Pretty sure the screen time stat would have me appalled 😦
Why you're not doing PMCCs
Selling FDs on memestonks always carries risk.

I sold 23 CC's on my PLTR shares and cried as it shot over 30.
I've got a BoJangles and a Chik-Fil-A within driving distance. I'm set for life.

Massive difference between a salad and a sandwich after effect.
Sell a call spread for a credit so you won’t get crushed by IV so badly if it does fall.

Buy the GME Jan 22 $30 call, and sell the $40.00 call if you believe it’ll be above $30, but below $40.00. Can play with the strike prices depending on risk tolerance. The first option you would profit on, and the second option you would collect the time value/premium on. Cheers!

Am I safe selling $35 PLTR weeklies? Shit if they did actually end ITM I’d be pretty happy to sell at that price.
Ofc it’s a big deal. FB Twitter ans Google have been deplatforming and preventing social media competition from emerging while simultaneously censoring and selling personal data.

If we talk about it, maybe we can break the monopoly (or mafia whatever way you want to look at it).

Imagine if people like Cathie were censored for saying PLTR is a good company? Just bc fb owns a direct competitor.

This is a steep slope that needs to end. We need to talk about it and get it fixed.

Rates are as low as they’ll be in your lifetime so...
I've been here since 2016, we probably had 80k subs then
Yeah so basically I got $26 in premium for those 2 calls I sold. Then I re-bought them for $1 per, so 26-2=$24 profit. I could've had the full $26 but for me, paying $2 to re-buy is better than having it moon at 5pm and having my shares called away. 

I think you're generally pretty safe with PLTR weeklies because it doesn't have super volatile swings like other stocks. It's hovered between like 22-28 for awhile now.
and here is the nightmare fuel.

shares and calls boys.  a good mix is the recipe.
Yea but it can just as well go to 0. With stocks like BB and GME sure you can get lucky and time the jump but MOST people aren’t that lucky.

So buying shares helps you and it helps everyone else inflate the stock even more.
this is the way

or it dips 10%  then goes theta mode for infinity
How is that at all a stupid response? You do realize regulation isn’t just one giant blanket topic right? Regulating something like who you allow to operate on your platform has nothing to do with environmental regulation, taxation, or anything else of the like. 
If you somehow genuinely think that a company denying use of an app that freely allows terrorist plots on its platform is worse than government censorship I don’t know what to tell you man. 
Every social media platform freely allows people to discuss their political beliefs, I think that is a good thing. An app where people are using it to discuss and plan the attempted murder of government officials to overturn an election has absolutely nothing to do with that.
That’s what I thought hahahah

read the DDs and decide for yourself, there are some solid ones on the front page. Honestly, if you can afford to lose it I’d say go in but it’s upto you. I’ve got 1k in just because the upside is pretty high, and i’m in it for the long run so if it takes a while as some of the DDs sat thats perfectly fine.

But being aware of them is a slippery slope for the others, most are isolated, if you give them a place to talk, you let them realize how many of them there are, you give them a place to plan, and when it comes to white supremacists and nazis that’s dangerous, just look at the capital. 

I’m not in any way calling to take away everyone free speech but when it comes to a platform that refuses to moderate it has to go. No one is getting duct tape out over their mouth here. If it was a site uploading CP and talking about it there would be no backlash but when they’re calling to kill senators for some reason there’s a debate on whether it should be taken down

Absolutely! Always check ore market first and that might give you an idea of how it will open. If it’s bouncing all over the place in the premarket, that usually means it’s going to be a volatile opening. If it’s flat, that usually carries into the session.

This is galaxy brain
Sell those you dumbass and buy shares holy shit you really cant read can you?!
10-30% honestly.

Even without the squeeze if RC can push the P/S ratio to 1 then $120 is price target
Idk, think that’s mod level shit tbh

What’s the best case scenario here?? GME skyrockets, then hopefully no one executes the calls he sold, then hopefully the market crashes, and then hopefully GME launches an EV by year end to skyrocket again?
Just noticed that we’re almost at 2.0M autists.

Fed doesn’t have much inflation power, only congress could actually do something that causes inflation
I think its dirty.  Pitt is too and bit more depressing.  Hate all of pa.  Wanna move somewhere south thats also darky tolerant.
Then you inch it up until you enter the position. But on volatile stocks like what we have experienced over the past few trading days, it’s highly unlikely you’ll not get your price.

you deserve all the tendies in your tendie moon mansion for this
Double D’s are easily spotted at Elon’s Mars Titty Town
Because the entire point is to take advantage of the short squeeze. You do that by buying shares and having them in your possession so that they can’t cover their shorts.
Keep going man I’m almost there 🤤
I bought the top Friday. Premarket will be quiet so you can pick some up then
Lol “butt plug”

Meh, I had those orders set up well prior to the run up. Cancelled them all Friday and reset my limit to $[4200.69](https://imgur.com/a/bfd2w31).


I also [bought more](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kxsd2p/daily_discussion_thread_for_january_15_2021/gjcpyuh/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3) shares on Friday, upping my avg from $16 to $27.


I’ll probably buy more on Tuesday too, I ain’t no bitch 😈
Agree, and just drunkenly spitballing but If Melvin and others were worried you'd think they'd insure themselves with calls, IV be damned.  Or if they thought the squeeze was going to bring the shares to, call it $200, why wouldn't they make an offer to buy the company for some price well below that but well above market price?   That or just say fuck it and declare bankruptcy and take a fat mulligan on this one.
Until I say I'm an investor making money and I get downvoted like now.
Essentially yes. Many think that the feds would

My $GME shares, without me, are useless. Without my $GME shares, I am useless. I must fire my $GME shares true. I must shoot straighter than my enemy who are trying to kill me. I must shoot him before he shoots me. I will...

My $GME shares and myself know that what counts in the war are not the rounds we fire, the noise of our burst, nor the smoke we make. We know that it is the hits that count. We will hit...

My $GME shares are human, even as I, because it is my life. Thus, I will learn it as a brother. I will learn its weaknesses, its strength, its parts, its accessories, its sights and its barrel. I will ever guard it against the ravages of weather and damage as I will ever guard my legs, my arms, my eyes and my heart against damage. I will keep my $GME shares clean and ready. We will become part of each other. We will...

Before God, I swear this creed. My $GME shares and myself are the defenders of my country. We are the masters of our enemy. We are the saviors of my life.

So be it, until victory are America's and there are no enemy, but peace!

Idk lol don't have those in cali
If I'm reading right, he sold 7 and bought 2 for net - 5 and is holding 200+ shares. So he's naked 300 shares and while the expiration dates allow wiggle room to play, a legit squeeze won't have people holding these calls. They will execute and sell. A real crazy squeeze and I can see 100 shares selling for more than the cost of 1 call at that price as people won't have time to actually execute and profit. This will be fun to monitor and I appreciate the intriguing entertainment of this.
Yeah, I would never date your mom
Solid curve on that cock.
80% of those 1400 will end up in purchases not stonks
Market buys help the price increase more easily...
I also invest like a boomer, but you'd be a dumbass retard to think boomers or others doing r/FatFire had a 5% return in 2020.  Also, the likelihood of a boomer talking about the stock market and ROI likely means they have a couple of milly stacked away, which means the average 20% ROI they had in 2020 netted them 400k easily while most day traders on this sub are eating at Wendy's and having chicken McNuggies for dinner. lmao

You can accuse Reddit, Twitter and Facebook of moderating content unevenly or poorly, but at least they do enough to be able to claim they're trying. They only way to get banned from Parler was to be a lefty and troll the MAGAs, because everyone knows the right loves free speech, but any sort of right wing crazy, including the unironic plotting of political murder was totes cool! 

Platforming an unmoderated crime in progress is a legally untenable business practice for companies like Google, Apple and AWS. They are busy pretending to self-regulate, in order to keep legislators off their back. It's the free market at work. Oddly enough, hosting a crime in progress is bad for business. Who'd have thought!?

Yes, so there is literal fear that these people felt that they couldn't buy shares from the market to close their positions. GME because of the float still being 22 million and increased by directors selling their positoins I'm not too sure about the infinity squeeze or a further squeeze at all. Interested to hear your opinion.

lmao
i agree it's net bullish that margin is tightening. but i also agree with the bears that institutional shorts have an easier time covering margin calls than retail, whether short or long.

covering a margin call is not the same as closing your position or having your short forced closed by the broker.  tightening margin does not mean shorts are obligated to buy back GME and close their short, it means the lender wants more collateral because of changing risk.

the sign here i read out of this is that staying short is becoming more expensive. some shorts will cry uncle, others will dig in.  staying long is also more expensive, provided you are long on margin. by definition, if you short shares directly, you are on margin. 

i can't see how this could possibly be net bearish if even half of the outstanding shares are still sold short. by most reports i have seen, GME shares are still historically shorted.

We’re not a bad country, we just have a low standard of living because people doesn’t believe in business and violent cartels corrupt everyone that’s why i treat my country on that disrespectful way but without America we could be like Venezuela or Zimbabue because we have fundamentally the same problems.

Yup this is how people go broke

I have literally been cashing paychecks this entire pandemic and putting them in my checking account like a moron. Come Tuesday I'm dumping 100k straight cash into these stocks and just praying. I either lose 25k or become a millionaire basically is what I figure

Yes? That’s like saying people shouldn’t be allowed to stop people from going onto their property or if someone threatens a member of a waitstaff in a restaurant they should be forced to serve them food. I can’t believe how hypocritical people with this viewpoint are. 
Nobody is stopping you from creating a phone company that willingly hosts apps that plots terrorist movements but you can’t force other companies to let them do that on their product.

He’s a mod.... lol
when you blowout your account for using a feature you don’t understand and finally learn it
I think they do it in the order of which you bought, aka you have to get through your own money before you use margin money
Also wondering this - when should I add shares
If the brokerage allows, you might be able to go to settings and "cancel margin" and it will tell you your outstanding margin used and that you cannot cancel it until it's 0.

I like swing plays like this. I’ll probably enter a position Thursday.
Usually there's an allocations section that will tell you what percentage is borrowed on margin and what percent your own assets.
I was affected by it. With fucking volcano growth in my 401k. My retirement projection moved up 4 years. Now it’s gonna go back to where it was
if you have to ask you shouldn’t even go near
I make about 100k in my day job depending on overtime, which can vary and be extreme at times. Decent benefits. I’ve always used my job as a safety net to be able to invest the way I have.
That’s just dingleberry logic, you don’t execute the executioner.

But saying let everyone be out in the open is literally advocating for nazis and white supremacists to speak openly, the government already doesn’t allow nazis or KKK to talk in public

> It’s impossible for us to be a cult

I would definitely say there's a cult of the bull, but I digress. I like the spirit of the post. Politics has been exhausting for 2020.
Exactly! I once looked up to analysts until I read the books on the best investors, they all hate and don’t listen to analysts. If you know what you are doing, you aren’t an analyst, you manage money! The analysts are the ones that don’t know what they are doing but have a cute college degree but have no money in the game. They aren’t punished if they are wrong, they are punished if they are different. They are a bunch of market “yes men“ with no balls to think for themselves. BB has cash and they’ve had great free cash flow for years. They aren’t even at a huge market cap. 5.5 billion with almost a 900 million in cash and 600 million in debt. WSB are better analysts than the “professionals” because we only make money if we are right! We don’t get paid to analyze, we get paid when our investments go up.
the power you hold...
I’ll take that into consideration

I definitely prefer going out, but since I can’t right now, I ended up finding other things to do alone.

Corporate censorship is better? Lol? You're ridiculous for thinking it's okay for private, unelected people being able to decide who says what. You're totally right. At this point, corporations have a bigger say in censorship than own fucking government.

Different opinion i can respect that. I don't really believe in new normal for long term.. sure we HAD a "temporary normal" for a while but people will want to travel. Chances of death, like in the 20's from Spanish flu or the war, meant people threw caution to the wind and party because you never know when you're going to bite it. I think we see similar set up here, people have been saving if unintentionally (because no place to spend it) and will want to party like it's the 1920's again because fuck it, YOLO, and you might not be around to enjoy it later. That's the psyche i think. I mean i also think we are the minority here.. sure we may be able to sit inside all day no problem but i don't think it's as normal as you think it is.

All the Chad's and becky's and the blue sky voters who said meh the world will keep turning are learning that they can't fix this mess unless there's a total realignment and emphasis on skills or certian types of behaviors.

Yeah Porsche and Lower Saxony had 95% of shares locked up (55% + 20%), respectively.
Glad you said this, because it’s exactly what I’m talking about man. I’m not betting on a stock, I’m betting on an option. Look at my post dates, and listen to what I’m telling you. 

I said buy CRM near open on 12/2. From it’s low on that date, it rose 15 points. 

I said buy BABA on either 11/17 or 11/18, it proceeded to rise 30 points. 

This is why I don’t provide sell dates. Because I’m not here to baby you, and tell you when to stop being greedy. Everyone that listened had the opportunity to take profit. I’m telling you that the position will be green, whether you want to continue to hold isn’t my problem. You don’t trade options like their stock, because they aren’t.
Friday was pretty bad but guess a correction will wipe out my 3 months of tiny gains

These analysts are paid nothing, and have to pump out a lot of content. They have zero accountability and responsibility for the content.  If they are wrong, no one cares, if they are right, no one really cares.  In any event, I put no "stock" in what they say. So this dooshbag Andrew Button has been churning out low grade hit pieces  about BB.  They are all simplistic, conclusory and completely underwhelming in depth or insight.  Here they are:

Earliest article I can find is a November 2019 article where he is cold on BB's attempted turnaround.  He is skeptical.

[https://ca.style.yahoo.com/3-reasons-blackberry-tsx-bb-131513753.html](https://ca.style.yahoo.com/3-reasons-blackberry-tsx-bb-131513753.html)

 Then 3 consecutive bullish articles in July 2020, though with no discussion about what the IVY opportunity actually is. the articles are essentially clickbait with no real analysis or insight that couldn't be gleaned in 3 minutes of research.

[https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-tsx-bb-stock-buy-140003452.html?src=rss](https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-tsx-bb-stock-buy-140003452.html?src=rss)

[https://ca.style.yahoo.com/could-blackberry-tsx-bb-millionaire-153038043.html](https://ca.style.yahoo.com/could-blackberry-tsx-bb-millionaire-153038043.html)

[https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-tsx-bb-stock-buy-140003452.html?src=rss](https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-tsx-bb-stock-buy-140003452.html?src=rss)

He then goes dark for a bunch of months while BB rockets from 3 dollars to 8.  He then reemerges in December, reiterating his theme this could be a big turnaround, not because of current revs but because of the turnaround.

[https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-tsx-bb-stock-turnaround-131104218.html](https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-tsx-bb-stock-turnaround-131104218.html)

Then, come early  January, Andrew has gone a little cold but still calls BB " one of the biggest TSX turnaround stories of the decade. Going from a failed smartphone maker to a growing software company, it has defied expectations. Now, we’re even starting to see the first indications of profitability."

[https://ca.news.yahoo.com/amphtml/blackberry-tsx-bb-claims-profitable-151047430.html](https://ca.news.yahoo.com/amphtml/blackberry-tsx-bb-claims-profitable-151047430.html)

Then another January article that seems a little warmer:

[https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/blackberry-tsx-bb-takes-lead-134217587.html](https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/blackberry-tsx-bb-takes-lead-134217587.html)

Finally today he comes out a little more negative. Notes the product adoption but notes other analysts desire to see revenue now.  Whatever.

[https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-tsx-bb-stock-show-150051569.html](https://ca.sports.yahoo.com/news/blackberry-tsx-bb-stock-show-150051569.html?src=rss)
So I don’t have a Facebook but I really wanted to brag on myself for a second. Found out today I have a 724 credit score. That’s the highest it’s ever been in my life. I had a 720 score and then I went through a divorce and many custody battles. It was so bad I took out loans to fund it all. I ended up homeless and eventually bankrupt. I’m now looking for my 2nd home with the highest score I’ve ever had. Never thought one day I would be gambling thousands of dollars on non researched stock options with advice taken from retards on the internet. Just had to share my excitement
I'd take the 40% gain and laugh as the simps on this sub fuck some vapid celeb ONE time and then continue to lose money on stupid plays.

Lots of people are talking about their exit strategies but imo trailing stop losses are better, if the market goes 🚀🚀then dips some % or $ value it'll sell some amount of stocks. If the price falls as quickly as it goes up, this might not be a good option as many people will be shorting/selling but at the same time, it has the best potential for profit, as it basically sells near the peak, assuming it goes up smoothly.
This some minority report shit

Limit ordered $5k of GME @ $25. Wish me luck on Tuesday.
I feel this is a battle of the retards, but for ego sake, I will respond.

While most people would have something called a stop loss, you have the notion of doubling down, which to me is asking to be punished. Thought out trades with patient deliver don’t incorporate buying the dip on anticipated losses. Obviously their is more then one way to observe and speculate on something, but I just dont see the survival in your strategy
quick question. I currently have 4.5k invested in GME. I just deposited 5500 more into my robinhood account but it only gave me $500 buying power and said in 5 days i can use the full amount. Can i just buy $5k more in GME stocks on margin in the meantime and invest that? I read that using margin on GME is bad for the bulls due to a potential margin call but since the money is actively being deposited i should be ok right? Thats only for retards using margin for more than they can cover?
Someone fucked up when they were sewing her nipples back on.  Ruins it for me

We had a correction in June, September, and October. We’ve been running hot since November without any kind of correction when one has happened almost every 2-3 months. We keep testing a new ATH & popping down. Idk fridays close was pretty bloody. Either we pop the top off & finally run a bit or we go down. With how tough it’s been to build any kind of support at the highs I think we’re running out of steam here.

You have to compare it to the float. VW had almost 0 float because of Porsche locking up most of the shares. GME there is a bit of wiggle room although short interest is high.
Except for 99% of the people on this sub have their limit sells set to $420.69.  That will become the massive sell off point and screw us all.  Set your limit sells sky high!

Calls suck. I sometimes buy OTM calls a couple of months out but I rarely get shorter dated calls for the reasons you outlined. I spent last Thursday and Friday buying $GME calls on the larger dips and monitoring like a hawk like I did when I first started trading, but I agree it's exhausting. I find it more enjoyable to invest in undervalued, black swan stocks like PLTR six months ago at $8 or OSTK at $7 like 12+ months ago and watch them explode once they become noticed by the broader community. It's a solid balance of value investing (yuck) and WSB lottery mentality (🚀). I hope you find or rediscover your balance.

Yeah I was 15-20 minutes before market close. 1/22 $10c was floating around $1.20 or so mid day and I placed an $.80 limit order. I forgot about it until I got the notification that I bought. By the time I looked at it, it had already bounced back over $1 so I was up over 20% almost instantly. It closed at $1.05 so I’m currently up 30%. I’m hoping that after Friday’s dip people start buying like crazy and spike the price up so I can get rid of them

I think the conversation on freedom of speech that this country needs to have is that on a platform that’s created by a private enterprise you agree to a terms of service. Aka you don’t have free speech on there. No one does. But in America you do. So either this country nuts the fuck up and says that “oh yeah on second thought the internet is a utility now and we need to seize Facebook and Twitter and make them completely owned & ran by the government” or nothing is going to happen. And I don’t think that’s realistic either way. That’s the cost of bending the knee to capitalism, corporate power vs people power vs governmental power. Corporate power is just getting stronger & they dominate our society. This isn’t right vs left. This is corporations vs wage slaves & the status quo. These companies could care less about what he was saying for four years knowing it was some dumb shit where he slowly brainwashed and dumbed down his followers. They only took action once it was clear that the status quo was threatened. Otherwise they didn’t care & rode the gravy train. Corporations will always act in their best interest. For you retards that think it’s a right vs left issue congratulations you’re making the people that want to keep us all wage slaves happy. For you retards that think freedom of speech applies to a private enterprise, congratulations you’re a moron.

This didn't age well
I see why you suggest this with a strong support line on its current price. However, it might be better to look for a reversal from its downtrend before making this play. Especially if you’re looking for a play in March.

Scenario 1: buy option a bounce from downtrend occurs - option becomes profitable or
 Buy option a bounce from downtrend doesn’t occur - option loses value

Scenario 2: wait to buy option a bounce occurs- bounce occurs option gains value but not as much as scenario 1 or Wait to buy option a bounce does not occur, keep lost value from option in scenario 1...bounce occurs enter position.

That would be a covered call if you needed the 100 shares first. Robinhood may require you to have those if depending on your permissions but in general you can very easily sell a call without the shares to back it (naked call) but I wouldn't recommend it as your potential loss is infinity

Some of you sound like addicts. It’s okay to take three days off from trading stocks, here and there. Find a hobby to enjoy your weekends.

Greetings new autist. First off, ditch the advice of value investing books like the Intelligent Investor - that won’t help you here. Like most retards on this thread, learn everything about stonks from the internet and this thread fuck a university education. (Try investopedia its a good resource). How do you trade? How do you know what stock is best? That’s up to you and it all depends on the DD (due diligence) on the stock you do. You could analyze its chart (technical analysis), look at its balance sheets, or look at factors that could affect its future growth such as possible mergers, predicted sales, new products etc. But truthfully you’ll never know, this game is speculative as fuck. A tip for you is never underestimate the power of the money printer and don’t be a gay bear. I spent way to long wasting opportunities with 100-200% upside because i was scared of a 20% downside. What got me into trading was watching The Wolf of Wall St (our holy scripture) at age 11  and from there I became a total fucking degenerate. I’m naturally good with numbers and fascinated by financial markets. Best platform to trade? If you’re American go Robinhood and if you’re Canadian go Wealthsimple or Interactive Brokers. May our lords and saviours elon, jpow and deepfuckingvalue bless you with tendies all the way from heaven and may your portfolio go 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕

I actually dont think it's really a free speech issue (at least not Constitutionally speaking). It's about what's good for a free society (and in my opinion, that would be not tolerating big tech corps dictating and controlling public discourse). There is a separate argument over whether social media is akin to public utilities, and this country long ago decided that those private companies should be regulated to ensure public access (ie. phone and electricity companies cannot refuse service to their political enemies). So therefore, due to this new form of censorship restricting what has become the new dominant mode of communication, is it now necessary for government to regulate big tech to ensure public access.

Yeah, closing Robinhood and reminding myself that I really suck at stocks has really helped me shut down my paper handed tendencies in favor of diamond handed tendies.
So since the market inverses things that make sense, does this mean we are going to go down for a bit as coronavirus scares go away and more stimulus comes?

I have 200 shares on margin from a few days ago, and am by no means "fully leveraged". what are the implications for me here? I'm bullish on GME but I don't want a headache just for the exposure, you know?

You ought to consider taking options off the table forever. Others have and have really turned around their luck here. GME is still a great investment long-term, even if you choose to diversify in the long run. Leave a couple *shares* in GME on your way out. I think you'll be glad you did.
So I could invest in the stock market. 

And they closed so they could keep me down and stop me from living out his dream of being richer than jeff bozos & sir elon. This is a perfect example of reverse racism and you should be livid.

i think most if not all financial companies have a capital adequacy ratio determined by their relevant regulatory body(ies)

i doubt any central bank conducts monetary policy by targeting the capital reserve requirements of brokerages though

you will, however, see more margin lending simply because the brokerage can borrow at a lower interest rate as the fed continues to crater yields through a variety of monetary policy actions

The bearish outlook mostly hinges on YOY revenue reduction, i am guessing probably due to auto production slowed down in much of 2020.  I think $bb has good upside especially with cars with connectivity is still at a limited scale. And with all the EVs rolling out to market this year and beyond, the stock seems undervalued. Just my 2 cents

As a conservative, it is shameful to see other conservatives abandon their principles and call for someone to tell companies what they can and cannot do. It's a sacred principle of capitalism, if you don't like it come up with a different company, don't go crying and ask for regulation on existing companies.

My guess is brokers count on retail traders to lose money they borrowed on margin.  Truth is more than 90% retail traders lose money. They just compile huge stacks of interest charged over the time.  Not that difficult to grow their interest stacks to $300m or more for popular brokers.

People flippantly throw this idea around like it’s that simple but it just isn’t true. This is like telling someone to start a new stock market because they don’t like the current one. If a company is making money off the people of a country then they should respect the rights of the people in that country. Also, “regulating companies is for commies,” but companies regulating people is... fine? You’re making excuses for corporations.

The counter argument to this is that the government has given twitter and other social media liability protection that regular publishers don't have. The nytimes can get sued for defamation if one of its employees libels someone. Twitter is acting as a publisher by picking and choosing its contents and users and could potentially have to deal with liability. The gov could force them to remain an open platform or lose their protections. Im sure twitter has ruined some innocent peoples lives with amplified libel.
Fuck Reddit honestly, I cannot describe to you how much I hate this shitty app, and this sub is the only thing keeping this app installed on my phone.

I hope they update the website / get these “kiosks” that let some one say “I want this game to play at max settings” and boom, here’s your options from our country wide used / new inventory for you to name a price point. Easy interface, simply and idiot proof process is the short game plus all the legacy business. Long term I’m still hoping this drawdown on non-starter inventory and focus on quick movers can build on their “experience” in the profitable stores. Long term I see VR support centers.

Get everything shipped to the store your kid wants to hang out at with his friends to play smash tournaments, Pokémon, 40k, whatever there. The employees are geek squad for your pc shit.

I just watched a poor Geek squad employee replace some old ladies keyboard batteries. Her husband had carried in the entire pc for them to figure it out.... I’m sorry for all the GME till jockeys that are about to play “did you plug it in?” ad infinitum

Yeah but 2000% of $100 gives you $2,000. Do it again and now you’re at $40,000. Do it again and you’re at $800,000. One more time and you’re in the millions too. Meanwhile they’re still pulling down 50 grand each year.

Believe the pros of vaccine is that it reduces the side effects of the virus, so for people with health problems older, the respiratory aspects/ailments won’t be as severe. It isn’t going to stop transmission because if you’re vaccinated, you can still transmit it to others. The goal is to not have it be as severe the effects. I got asthma so sometimes I wonder what would happen if I got it, but I always have my mask on and go thru sanitizer n shit.

If you’re making money off the people of a country then you should be respectful of their rights in that country.
I could give you like ten honestly. But ill start with new management that has proven track record of working in digital space, shift to digital, new deals with microsoft and shift into selling pc parts and equipment, new build-a-pc in stores, shorts, big money buying up, new consoles increasing sales all year and providing them a rocket to start out on and move quickly in this shift they want to make. And extremely undervalued as it is with a 2.5 Billion ish market cap

Honestly man, whenever you feel like completely gambling.  There's plenty of places to look up the steps to enable options with whatever you're using to trade.  

I hope the following doesn't come across as anything other than my experiences, since I still have no clue what I am doing.  

1.  Trust the deep dives, but make sure that other people in the thread support it too.  Look through the comments and look at the calls in chat and find ones that aren't at the top of the range or closest to today's current date...those are lottery tickets, and as my professor told me year's ago, lottery tickets are the idiot tax, except the prices for the ticket are much higher here. I have had much better luck finding calls that are just barely ITM and a month further out than WSB is calling for.   The increase in cost is often not that much higher, and it usually has a much better chance of printing (less reward but with way less risk).  

2.  Don't get caught up in the FOMO.  You probably already get this, but once the R's in chat start posting their gains (like happened with GME last week), the premiums to buy into calls have skyrocketed as a result, and the answer is always stocks at that point.  

3.  Start small with options.  Losing $500 on PLTR calls in the course of a month around Thanksgiving hurt badly.   Or don't.  It's your money.  Enjoy it.  

Good luck, and god speed, fellow R.
It might take...a long time..... to find that out don't you think

Say you don't originally have any contracts and you want to create/sell a contract. I thought you would need to create that contract with 100x shares you currently owned? And if you only have cash, you would buy the shares first. That's how it works on Robinhood it seems. I'm not positive though since I don't normally create. I just buy/sell.

Is it just because other brokerages will take your money instead of the shares once the contract is exercised/expired? Basically use your money as collateral.
Had a wrangler 12 years ago.  Was sorta enjoyable to drive around with no doors or roof in summer, but the soft top got broken into so many fucking times, it was cold as shit in winter, and trying to chase down the fix for death wobble ended with me replacing half the damn suspension and still being completely undrivable on the highway.

Card stores buy and sell cards, it's why they are hubs. Unless GME is going to sell cards second hand and get into that market those stores will never stick as hubs. Without the ability for people to buy cards on the fly for tournaments, it's just a space. 

The other options can work, even selling cards to kids that wander in, it just won't ever turn into a spot for players.

I don't think so. However, it was a set up. There were people in there that was from another party taking advantage of it. Anyhow, it is bigger than you and I. You and I wont do shit. Being born and raised at a 3rd world country, I've experienced this before. I can tell where US is going. It's not something new. There's nothing I can do but ride the tide and cash out when SHTF.
Good news? Cause I’m in deep hahaha
Am I too late to the party?? Or should I still buy
Solid advice. Not been in this long I'm one of those "new young investors" & refuse to put in more money until I feel I actually know what I'm doing. Past the "how do options work" stage & on to the "ways to spot value in the fundamentals" phase. Gambling is really my only option until I have a grasp on all this analytics stuff like P/E, P/B, D/E, and FCF . Can't research something to hell if you don't know what to look for 🤷‍♂️. Any indicators you commonly look at from balance sheets or any other general research advice?

No. Free speech is a cultural ethic. It's not just the 1A. These companies are violating values our society (and all free western liberal ideology) is based on and using their monopolistic power to do it.

It was 1:13 for VW is lower than that but it’s hard to determine with retail making up a lot of the float, but if Cohen bought more we could really be pushed to the stratosphere
The issue was that well known conservative leaders were talking to their supporters about things big tech didn't like and parler wasn't willing to censor them without reason. So they gave them reason and parler cucked out.

Earnings are scheduled to come out in roughly 3 weeks. Consensus is 64 cents per share. I expect they will blow that number away. Even with the Remington plant only back on line for part of the qtr and start up costs they are still cranking out product at record levels. In addition to their ammo the optics for fire arms are also out of stock so those sale numbers will also be very good. A earnings surprise would do very good things to the share price. Ammo prices are skyrocketing and that will not stop anytime soon.

I'm left leaning and don't like mango but mama Cathie is right.

I found this article about Jesus and shit a while back and hearing about Cathie supporting Parler helped me make the connection.

"As I began to get this idea of a firm going and realized that I was fighting this war, I knew I had to name my company “ARK” for Ark of the Covenant..."

"As soon as I said that to myself, I felt a wham and I really feel like that was the Holy Spirit just saying to me, “Okay, this is the plan.”

"Every two weeks there was an exit of a significant amount of my wealth into the company. And I would kneel down and say, “Okay, God, You’re in control. Even if this company fails, I know I’ve done the right thing. This is a walk of faith for me. Your will be done.”

100% of the people in support of big tech censorship are only in support of it because it is currently silencing ideas and speech that they find disagreeable. Cathie has an IQ above 80, so she recognizes the danger of this. those of you who disagree with her are inherently stupid, so there's nothing we can do to help you understand
You know there are also actual casinos

This sub is keeping me entertained throughout this pandemic. All the shitposts, memes, finance humour.  However, you also learn a lot of new information and from time to time there are some solid DD's and this sub is not only entartaining you, but could also help you to make money. Furthermore, it makes me feel part of something bigger, especially since it seems that we share the same ideals and we all agree that BB, PLTR and GME will soon moon. No political bullshit, we are here to make tendies together,  f. uck the shorters and market manipulators and shop for Lambo's. Sometimes it feels kind of strange when I talk with my real life friends, cuz I can't talk about the topics discussed here and it seems that I feel closer to my Internet friends with whom I am holding the line and diamond handing. Actually, I think that this sub has grown from a place to discuss risky bets to a community of similar-minded individuals.

The argument is that these companies go beyond just being companies and are legit avenues of communication. What would happen if all the cell phone companies started shutting off peoples lines because of something? Or cutting off an entire state from the internet because it has a Republican Governor?
But if they have to ship the parts doesn't that defeat the point of a PC building center in the store?

Right? The whole point of us choosing GME isn't to save it, but because everyone was wanting to kill them, but they weren't going to actually die. It was a bet against the popular crowd based on the fact that they aren't the next Blockbuster.

Eh, it happens. Rub some dirt on your dick, it’ll be alright.

I'm seeing more of this in the past week now in online discussions.  

People think it's wrong to censor but are afraid of speaking their mind, or even claiming a political stance, and thus losing their job for doing so.   

While others are claiming we should censor and fire people who hold a different world or political view.

We're at a very very very strange time in American History.
Thats why we should fuck them in the market
yep just like you

>Oh yeah, one more thing. The Melvin underling also wrote "There's contradictory evidence as to if the shorts went up this week or went down" this was a dead give away. The data was out on the 15th. It went way up. Shorts doubled down but they are close to tapping out.

They doubled down on a huge red negative percentage just like our own retards would do, and it's going to be amazing the next few trading days.

Arbitraugers would buy it and exercise it. I'm still a beginner, but the first rule of options is that ITM calls will always be worth at least \[(share price - strike price) x 100\] and that value comes from the ability to exercise it at any time and arbitration. So if the share price is $100 and I previously bought a $50 LEAP, the contract would be at least $5000 (this moves up as stock moves up ofc). If the contract was any lower, arbitrageurs buy it up and exercise right away.

Even if the squeeze happens within an hour, the contract would still move with the share price as arbitration occurs.

**tl;dr** There would always be buyers due to the arbitrage opportunity.
I watch a lot of How It’s Made, and this factory is insanely next level.

I made my first $1000 gain with JNUG back in the day. Promptly lost double that on JNUG the following week. Fuck JNUG.
It's true, all of it. Funny you mention OSTK. As someone who rode Overstock from 7 to 123 (and then sold when it dipped back to 100 because my hands were too diamond), I see the signs here with GME. Easy fucking play, especially considering the play already proved extremely profitable last week for anyone who bothered to get in and it was profitable based on Cohen joining the board and FOMO on the idea of the short squeeze, not even the squeeze itself.
I have calls. If i am wrong I make money, if I am right I win internet pride

If you care about what a CEO says that doesn’t have to do with their stock then you’re a loser I’m sorry
Adding to LMT leaps are dirt cheap and Cathie has been adding the last couple days. VSTO leaps is an ammo play with $1b backlog. My biggest play is still FDX, options are dirt cheap, stock has gotten nothing but hammered on good news and they will blow out next ER that includes Black Friday, cyber Monday, vaccine shipping, excessive surcharges and holiday shipping extended to Jan 19, yet the stock trades at 2018 levels after this selloff - this is a no brainer esp after IV came in🚀🚀🚀
Market orders are good for day trading pops/drops.

IE if you limit order TSLA at a resistance point with a cheap bid you probably only get filled on a fail and dump.

Yep, and they’ll be able to renegotiate good leases in a post covid world too. But I agree. They’ll get the 100m shelf so should assume 100m bucks in the bank soon.

She tweeted support for parler-- a haven for right wing types.
Oh? Like I did?
Something similar happened to a friend of mine last month,  on a much smaller scale,  and different exchange,  but basically the same thing...  Instant trade after ACH transfer that was denied by the bank two days later.  The  broker froze the account and emailed him .  He had already gotten an email from the original bank that they weren't going to allow the ACH transfers,  on a technicality, and so he had already initiated an ACH to the broker from a different bank to cover the original deposits. 

A few screenshots and email exchanges later, the broker just said yeah ok don't do that again,  and held the account frozen for 3 days until the new ACH transfers fully cleared.  Positions and gains were kept. 

Brokers are essentially loaning you money on margin when they allow instant trading on ACH. They do this because they want customers.  Putting customers in jail and treating them like ass is inconsistent with getting new customers, or with allowing your new customers to gain confidence with you and putting more money in your brokerage.

No BB love? :o
The major reason for their improvement in working capital, per the last earning transcript, was then selling off unprofitable stores and getting out leases, selling the corporate jet and office buildings.

This isnt a sustainable to maintain their balance sheet.  Most of the easy financial engineering has been done.  It just get grimmer from now on.

We will see qith next earnings release.

I've been selling stupid premium on $FUBO. 

Theta gang feels like free money sometimes.
what are her views?
The premiums on the calls are out of control, if you guys keep on buying calls and pushing those prices up the ones that sold those calls will have to buy the stock to cover or buy the call back either way both things go up. So in a way the more we pile and bid up GME call options he stock will just naturally follow and I believe this is in big part the reason. Call me stupid but buying the stock and then selling an OTM call option is a nice neutral way to play this one.
This point in time, right now, might be the best inflection point for the MOASS.  There’s too many factors coming together:  margin call timing, 10% rule, underwater shorts, and most importantly the1.8m person community of WSB 💎 🖐 autists with sell orders at 420.69

You idiots really think Cathie gives a shit about the blumpkins who post on Parler? Nah fam. She’s clearly getting at how fucking bizarre it is that people suddenly think they can cancel/censor everything they don’t like. We SHOULD be talking more about censorship, what ever happened to “I disapprove of what you have to say, but I will defend to death your right to say it”? Free speech is about to get cancelled way things are going 🙄

Nah. By boomer-proof I meant that there is no way a boomer would decide to invest in a stonk based on a peanut emoji on twitter. I, on the other hand, am a man of culture, who after researching GME for months have been waiting for this type of confirmation bias to buy more, despite the current price levels. Therefore we, the autistic retards, we have an upper-hand and can get more shares prior to the squeeze in comparison to a motley-fool/barron's reading boomer to whom the squeeze is finished and GME still has no future.

In regard to the twit, it can be interpreted in so many ways, I see no grounds for manipulation. Just a subtle wink to WSB crowd and other interested parties that fight has just begun (or a rocket is about to start). Although that wink is what I was waiting and hoping for. A self-made 35y millennial billionaire seems to be on our side of the squeeze equation. It's not just WSB vs Melvin now but big money (+WSB) vs big money.

RC's twit also proves that he's agenda and will be vocal about it Musk-like. I would consider shaking off shorts to be one of the priorities to making GME great again and (what's more important) cementing RC's position in the board for the years to come. Ryan joining the board achieved more in 2 days than Sherman's omnichannel trashtalk in years. Each major stockholder can see that - Boomer-age in GME's management is done for which is great for a game retailer.

I gotta say... for her to be in the position that she's in, where everything she touched last year turned to gold, and she's at the top of her game with the most to lose... for her to come out and make this statement now takes incredible guts. This has got to be something she honestly thinks is a big deal, if she's willing to risk her reputation and her business's reputation on it. You can agree or disagree with her statement, but she had the balls to put it out there. You've got to respect that.

There was an incredible (I would say surprising, for my first time really paying attention) amount of bids on all strikes on 1/15 calls on the 1/15 expiration date, even low strikes, up until the close. Liquidity will be there, volume might be low since the gain is small (bid might be a few cents below the intrinsic value) and not worth it for most people, but there are apparently plenty of people okay with picking up a few basis points in an afternoon.  Take a look this Friday and you’ll see what I mean.

You realize that whenever the entire sub lobotomizes itself to follow a single play like GME, some people get tired of seeing the same ticker spammed over and over again, so maybe stop assuming every bear is PR and realize most of them are posting bearish thesis because its counter to the circlejerk. You guys are so paranoid about any naysayers you dont notice that you’re the reason they exist. Shut the fuck up, its a three day weekend for gods sake everyone here already knows about GME and the short squeeze, I have shares but I personally hope every person whos used the rocket-ship emoji this past week nukes their account and dies choking on bear dick.

Buy shares
So we’re still 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 right
yes “🥜”
I stupidly brought CFD margins on Friday, which I realise now isn’t helping the cause. Can my broker force me to close my positions when the squeeze really starts to happen? 

I plan to double up with actual shares on Tuesday because we’re going to the fucking moon 🚀🚀🚀
Who would buy them when everyone knows it's a squeeze?
You’ll be back buddy.

Lol. Such a worthless law and complete waste of time.

This isn’t investment advice. 

But I’m still sitting on some calls that don’t expire for a good while and I may buy more in addition to more shares on Monday. 

If it moons I could give a fuck about IV

Wokelords want to cancel cathie because she said “let’s have an open discussion about censorship”

I think so. I'm just using degenrad.io
Why would Cathie tweet the app out if the app is shutdown on platforms? She making a statement? 🤔
Scroll bitch

Not even that. Visa is banning “far right” groups from processing payments. And cellphone makers. AAPL and Goog won’t publish apps they deem unmoderated.

Invest in a capitalist economy but then gets mad when companies have a right to protect their own interests under a capitalist economy. Okay bro

fair enough, the point is there shouldn't be any censorship.
You're not taking 100 shares out of the supply by the way. Depending on who's selling you that call they may not have to hedge it at all

I visited my sister who moved to Wisconsin and saw a Piggly Wiggly, no shot I'm shopping there
I think so, cannot remember what it called but if your long calls have risen in premium enough you can STO short calls and close longs and use that premium to cover the collateral, that what your getting at right? I'll have to ask around but I believe you need to be approved by your broker to be able to hold naked shorts regardless in case it goes against you and the collateral is not enough.
No, you didn’t.
Seems like that fucks over people with real jobs

Best Buy only caters to the lowest common denominator. Their in-store component offerings would never satisfy a high-end build. If GME built an inventory sharing system where components could be transferred overnight between locations, this would cater to an entirely new market segment -- and one that is willing to pay for premium options.

you made the 10k with money that wasn't yours since the funds weren't settled. the 10k now belongs to them. you cant spend somebody's money and keep the profits. you fucked up

These spikes are wild. I had 30/34c spread last week for a .10 *credit*. Made over $9k with zero risk. Going to attempt that again this week.
As bullish as I am on PLTR, this honestly sounds like a regular webinar by sales people at Palantir to clarify what the products can do for potential clients... This doesn't seem like a *historic* day or even a conference. Just sharing as it may be better to approach this demo with lower expectations

Ya it was pretty easy to notice stalking your profile for 3 minutes. Unfortunately I don't really actually look at the MIT courses after I collect them lol, though my excuse is that I collected them before I finished school.

In practice I think if you are just going to buy LEAPs, look for January strikes with a lot of OI so u don't lose too much from bid-ask.
Can't wait for you to be proven wrong
alright you poor fucking loser lmao. 5 figures is it?
It's almost 99% never a good idea to buy the second market opens. Maybe a few mins after is better (Ideally watch & decide what price you like). Reason being its might either ramp up quick or sell off hard then recover. People often take profits from the pre market run ups.

Nobody cares about innovation. They care about people seeing what they write. Twitter could change everything to comic sans and change their logo to a giant dildo and it would still be the top app because that's where the people are.
Idk ppl keep saying it and I can’t find any news
It is out baby check my profile
SEC ENTERS THE CHAT
If you think $GME will squeeze really hard, wouldn't it make sense to buy call LEAPS? I know the IV is crazy, but couldn't the value of the contract increasing during the squeeze outweigh any IV negatives? And since they're LEAPS there's no chance you would miss the squeeze. The benefit is that you could decrease the available shares at a cheaper price/share.

This. There’s no honor in going down with the ship here. Panic selling because your option dropped 10% is one thing. Having a trade go hard the wrong way, knowing it’s a loser and salvaging what you can is quite another.  Nobody actually cares if you diamond hand it down to zero, and they’re sure not going to bail you out.

Wrong 🍏, aapl to 100
I love this sub.  Never change.
Lmao. So I sold two 1/15 30CC last week for like $26 of premium (because my risk tolerance is really low). Then I just bought it back Friday before close for $1 per contract. An extra $24 a week isn't too bad for an ultra conservative strike. Now imagine if I had 5000 shares or so.
U mad

I say this in all seriousness and with all due respect: This attitude is exactly what Robinhood counts on. This is how they make money. You can bet your ass when they execute your order, *they* use a limit order. When it gets returned to you, you get the market price. The difference between the limit order price and the market price is just additional profit for them.

Fucking piece of shit stock doesn't rally with anything else

I owned it at some point and sold (am still bullish but it was killing my patience)
Earnings are scheduled to come out in roughly 3 weeks. Consensus is 64 cents per share. I expect they will blow that number away. Even with the Remington plant only back on line for part of the qtr and start up costs they are still cranking out product at record levels. In addition to their ammo the optics for fire arms are also out of stock so those sale numbers will also be very good. A earnings surprise would do very good things to the share price.

Schwab best platform imo. Investor checking, Amex cards, soon to have thinkorswim integration, great customer service. I trade on my monitor so I don’t care what mobile looks like but with TD merge it’s going to look very streamlined.
just another 2bit hustler
I’m balls deep so I’m sort of biased. I actually think it’s a really good short term play tho. The long term depends on if they can actually put there plans together. They’re either gona make it big or not. No in between
Bringing it back on topic, which ticker lets me profit off this horror show best and why is it GME?

yes but he had LEAPS not weeklies lol. i'm sure he knew the value of the company would go up as well. he made a very bold play and it worked out! i've seen ppl yolo their entire account on LEAPS and it almost never went wrong, probs cus it's a bull market, but yeah.

Uh, GME is not even started yet duh
Yeah, that's what I was also thinking. It gives you the power to lock up more shares at a cheaper price and if it squeezes hard, the gains will outweigh the IV. Either I'm stupid or people here are just mindlessly commenting the "buy shares, not calls" sentiment.
[removed]
they'll probably censor her. 
Real talk, TWTR got balls to censor that app and the president.
Imagine you censor the president of China/Russia and the app of his party? There shouldn't be any censorship no matter how much you disagree with them. You'd think that it will only happen at a 3rd world country. lol
Okay. I googled and you are right. Free money in Roth!

LOL yes. Gme was the last og yolo... can't believe I sold out way too early... for like 100% gain vs like 10,000%
Proof or ban since you talking 10gs?
I was 14 months too early getting into it last March but I still think it's THE play going forward. Has all the right contracts, is already working with the DoD since at least last April, is the only vendor that's anti -chyna, already had manufacturing in India to take advantage of that market, is the main choice for most countries worldwide that still want american trade. It's only real problem at this point is how long it's been around and how many shares it currently has. Shit moves like molasses and is shorted heavily anytime it gets neat paying out a option contract that's below 4 or above 4.50. You can't even run the wheel on it because the premium is fucking dogshit.

i think gme will dip back to the twenties before it goes parabolic if it goes parabolic
Bad idea. Just rest you dont lose gains in a few days

And a really bad idea if you got covid
I’m convinced. Will buy BB calls tomorrow
This is the best 🚀
I just see it obviously in a short term downtrend and with overall sentiment might see it sell off to that previous support. But over time I think it’s a good hold just wouldn’t personally enter right now
right -- it's also called checking the price before placing the market order. you are all larpers this is not difficult stuff
Market closed Monday, theta is the only thing working that day.

This play is in trouble, I don't know that there is enough of a catalyst this week. Elon is capable of anything, so maybe. Experience tells me you'll be lucky to keep the equity you have, but again, Tesla is not one to ever bet against.

[removed]
A normal limit sell will sell as soon as the stock hits that price. If it is at 90 and your limit is 100, it will sell as soon as it hits 100. The second option you’re talking about requires a stop loss sell. Just google that, because there are a couple of these and someone else has already explained it better than I will.
BB can be bought on the tsx under bb.to but i dont think gme can?
Too many letters. Could not read. But I saw bunch of rockets. I am in!!

PAISA? 🇲🇽
Wtf i love Cathy now?
Hm. It seems like you’re not talking money. 

So, what the fuck are you talking about?
I can see how some people are getting confused with the post, but this only applies to options than ran into the money and profitability substantially.

Like there no point in selling a OTM call lower than existing ATM call (creating bear call spread) cause there's really no profits to secure in the first place and your opening up to loss and potentially getting excercised early from lower strike. However if it has run up significantly during the day and one doesn't want to take a day trade I can see this work if one believes a real move to downside the next morning that will not go further down than sold to open lower call strike.

Otherwise I'm taking from this long post it really about selling to open a higher strike from current open call to limit downside by converting a unlimited reward/risk into a limited reward/risk situation (bull call spread) and locking in the bulk of profits (key is majority of it, as unless there some delta neutral spread being created there will be a tiny loss)  but since the lower strike protects the higher call strike from being excercised early (easily covered) until you can close the next day without triggering a day trade. THIS IS THE BEST WAY

I get what OP saying but it could be cut quite short to this fact alone, I sense he was attempting to give a broad approach in these scenarios rather than picking the best one.
I assume there are people on the sub planting “ fake news” Any tips how to recognize Them
Cathie
pointing out indeed that it does not. lol
The April $60 GME calls are going for $5.50. 

Insanity.

I’ll stick with my 2/19 $35c.
This is the most accurate thing I have ever seen. 

I need to watch this everytime before I jump into the wsb daily discussion.
i mean so long as you're not pushing yourself its actually probably better
100% GME portfolio or ban
GME $100 will be so lit
xiaomi
Transferred another $1000 to my IB account. You know what this white ass boy is buying Tuesday...GME baby.
Maybe good to watch I see more downside in near future though before going up
[deleted]
you are a fucking idiot lol. use real data and not your larping fantasy
I need a good buying opportunity
That’s where this is heading though
My retard analysis says it either 🚀 or does go back down to $28ish and then 🚀 all before earnings. Who the fuck knows after that guidance tho
[removed]
Agreed it was unwise, but I thought it was well known that Cathie wood leans right 🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️🤷‍♂️
❤️🥺❤️🥺❤️🥺
GME just hit the bottom of the reverse double market index trend. This means that as long as the SGRX value stays above 3 then we are looking at a 15-20% day. All of this could come crashing down though if the shorts stay above the receding sell amount. If it does that then look for the upward wedge-trend to break 38 before you buy back in.

this is how crayon dd sounds to me
Who is Cathy?  Not familiar with this person you speak of.
Buying calls means someone else's 100x shares are getting locked up. It DOES take out the supply, but I completely forgot about IV.
My Schwab Amex Plat comes in hopefully tomorrow. 👀 Can’t wait to flex on Chick-fil-A employees taking my card.
Very bullish on BABA right now
if you think getting upvoted on wsb indicates accuracy, you are truly lost
Been the same price longer than 9 months. It’s CenturyLink. Didn’t they always do fiber? I liquidated half my bag once it hit over $11 again. Tired of it.

Yeah bro, I fucking hate long weekends
It makes more sense because, as an army, that is the only way to squeeze a short. By buying all available shares and holding, it puts the pressure on those holding the shorts, is my understanding. This doesn’t happen when you have calls.
Decided yesterday, after some considerable DD & 9 drinks, to do the same on Tuesday.


Selling all my Ark F&G, NVDA, MSFT, etc.

It’s all going in BB.

I’m done being in stocks that are trading at 40+ times earnings.

BB is at 4.5 x earnings. It has the power of the meme. It has a real competitive advantage & a value prop.

It’s already made me + 50% in my first 750 shares.

Long live Cathy, long live Chen.

To be completely fair, it's not Canada's fault you have a holiday tomorrow... you guys brought this holiday on yourselves
Yeah it's pretty disturbing, those neighborhoods are in the news every night usually multiple people getting shot every day
You can’t open more orders than you have in your account. Limit orders automatically tie up capital. So if you have $1,000 buying power and set a $1,000 limit order on a stock good for 60 days your buying power will be $0 until you are filled or the order is cancelled
Just depends, I wasn’t confident last week..100 a game (spreads only). So naturally i doubled it this week to try and come out ahead. I try not to gamble that much, lose enough on stonks already

Yeah Brady never had the tools in NE like he does now, but saying the Patriots won't be back on top of the AFC after all the cap hits expire is asinine. They're both born winners.
Hm they have come down a bit. You thinking it's a reopening play as folks buy non-sweats?  Looking at dri (dsw) too, people going to need new kicks to get back to the office
Coincidentally I will also get a massive bonus if BB hits $15, $20, or $30

Makes a point here. Elon musk makes no contributions to physics. Everything he’s doing and trying to do relies on physics that we’ve known for 100+ years

Ooffff.

Someone go put a dick in that hand so she can't tweet.
Get the fuck out
This is the dumbest shit I’ve read today
Do you not follow Ryan Cohen on twitter or look at any posts in this sub???
NOK or bust
TP hands
Try a 30 second plank, then when that seems easy and simple. Wait 30 to 45 seconds a do another one. Then keep doing them in sets of 4 giving yourself 3 minutes between sets.( This is what my PT got me to start doing when I cut from 236 to 140 in 7 months and ran into a crap ton if imbalances) It has a fun side effect of taking up time but being super easy to start and you end up with a happy back and awesome core. Just gotta hydrate.
I do get sinus infections so that might make sense.

Ah, thank you. This is a pretty succinct explanation, i appreciate it.
God fucking damnit, can't I have a weekend free of market research, memes, and horrifically bad decisions?
Rub one out
Good luck with that. Parler is dead. Super dead. Also it was coded by dumbasses. People literally downloaded everything ever posted on there before it went down. Videos that were uploaded had gps coordinates in the meta data. There is an interactive map online showing the exact places of every single parler video ever. Parler also wanted shit like peoples phone #s and ssn but wasnt secure at all.

Regardless of your political views from a tech standpoint it was a disaster.

What did I miss about Cathie.   Why are people shitting on my boo ?
Apparently not.
Went to /r/stocks and the top thread was some guy liquidating his entire portfolio to go all in on PLTR. This sub is leaking and not sure if that's a good thing tbh lol
Rc tweeted.  It's moon time my friend.
Rodgers is gonna win. He’s still pissed they drafted Jordan love in the first round. Wants to say fuck you to whoever made that decision.
My suggestion is to not leave Melvin on your resume once you lose your job in the coming weeks from your company going bankrupt.  
  
Best of luck to you 🥜
I’ll show you why you are proving my point. I agree with you and Cathie yet you presumed I’m in the other camp (similarly, i bet many have read and presumed the opposite). By commenting on the subject at all i invited unwarranted criticism through speculation. If I was a fund manager for a lot of people who construed my statement as support for their opposing political party they may be inclined to stop using my services. 

As you said, hopefully the investor / ark community doesn’t really care, but you must be a bit disconnected from the current intensity of the political arena to think her tweet doesn’t have the potential for a political shitstorm. Probs takes one headass celebrity to comment back saying they will no longer invest in ark based on her support for Parler, mango man’s preferred social media platform. It’s an additional variable that Cathie shouldn’t introduce to Ark Invest as a fund manager.
I went 0-6 last week, 4-0 this week... i dont know what to make of it
nowadays they call themselves "big-boned"
Exactly! 👁👄👁
cathie loves parler
I hope I have time to purchase more Tuesday morning or even Wednesday. Although, that's pretty optimistic (or pessimistic since the squeeze wouldn't be happening)
I alternate between WSB and furiously multiplying 356 420.69 or 694.20

God the weekends are so boring now. Only thing keeping me entertained nowadays is stonks, video games, and porn.
This is a great exchange of ideas I came here for. True DD
Its toxic
This is truth. I have an addictive personality, but always managed to curb it gambling. I even lived in Vegas for a stint and did ok. But that same line that I felt would be easy to cross standing at the craps table is present here. I get hyped, convince myself it’s “my time” and get revved up to start transferring funds. If you have difficulty shaking that feeling off, this probably isn’t the healthiest place.

It's a sign of your smell receptors recovering from an infection, it's not only covid that does it but it's obviously more commonly known about now because of how many people have gotten sick and are working through long-covid symptoms.

Alright I’m in 600 shares Tuesday morning. I’ve always purchased market orders during hours when the market is open. What’s the protocol for purchasing or setting up an order when the markets closed? Should I set a limit order? Sorry I’m a noob. Appreciate the help.
Now I am even more conflicted
Lol ppp
I’m going with June or July GME calls Tuesday but whatever is left goes into shares. Lets get this bread my brothers.
I got downvoted a week ago for saying Twitter was gonna hit $45. How you like me now bitches. I honestly think we see it land somewhere around $39-40
Holding gme forever
Dude literally look at the rednecks of the US, retarded.
You must’ve been thrilled when Lamar and Patrick mahomes got injured

But then go to r/nfl to comment: awww man it’s so sad they got injured. I’m going to drop out of school, go to the church, get a degree in theology, and pray until my ballsack falls off for them to recover. So sad. I’m crying myself to sleep because I’m so heartbroken

like everyone else
Cathie in shambles, Brady in Lambos.
Read any of the hundreds of dd threads on GME in this sub. This is the daily thread aka the battlefield.
I don’t want those either, I just would want to be remembered like him

Can confirm, just dropped 5 hundo on GME market order for Tuesday.
I agree that it will be bullish for oil prices and will provide a trade opportunity.
People who ask “why is GME mooning?”. Just swipe your thumb up twice on the subs main page and read any DD. There’s your answer.
They still have a lot of work to do but there’s no reason why they can’t adjust accordingly with the behavioral shift to e-commerce with their current infrastructure. It’s not a large part of my portfolio but I like the r/r here

why is insider selling at an ATH?
Bold move on XPEV good luck
I could see it halt honestly. With 71 million shares gobbled up and insane volume. If anything that'll make the stock worth more as it affects supply/demand in a very direct way. When TP disappeared people were paying far out the ass for small quantities.
<33 Cathie
JOIN US! There’s room for everyone at GME gang.... except shorts lol
Agreed. I just commented on r/personalfinancecanada for the first time in a long time, some of those people are so nasty and so rude. I guess they crabby from making 7% a year or something.

Has been bouncing off support at 820 with rsi low and mfi near 100, looks like it'll hit 840 and if a nice green week, you'll probably see that 855. With it being inauguration week, you actually have a good chance.

I'm here to release my inner autism, so the real world doesn't have to see it
This isn't about paper hands  
It reflective that one may of caught a breakout and it ran too high, gone too parabolic and for some reason they cannot use a day trade to close.  
So it nothing more than a stop gap measure to close out in the next morning.  
Though I did want to provide other alternatives therefore in that regard the best option to the least best option if one in a rush has been listed above.  
I did edit some parts as I looked further into it and question some people to make it slightly easier.

Looking back 5 years, I feel like the majority of stocks trend up over the course of a year, if you buy some safe OTM (+$5 or so?) with a year expiration I feel like you'll generally be pretty safe, regardless of bull market. Maybe I'm too young to know what a real bear market is.
But what if you want to purchase the stock if it falls to a specific price? I do that all the time when I want to purchase shares, and I usually get the price I want if not better and it allows me to enter into the position at a lower price.
Bruh we all dumped our tesla positions for GME I got called a retard by my friends and family for it and everything
ah... for pre-market yeah I'd assume that this is good advice. Anytime liquidity is low you should protect yourself by doing limit orders. For normal trading hours it doesn't really matter
It would be near impossible but like with the intelligence, passion and work ethic that he has, it’s doable. If I’m assuming that my brain will be with me in elons life then he’ll no I’mma fuck up every company he has

Did that the day GME went from 20 to 30. Saw in the morning that the price was $22 said to my self I’ll wait for the dip and it never happened. Isn’t always the correct choice. I guess I was being greedy though.

I don't use it normally, I needed it for the 1000 dollar instant deposit last time GME dipped since my funds didn't clear in time with Schwab.
I can do that probably all next week to avoid this , good thought.

You seem not to be concerned at all with the crazy printing going on that is eroding the value of the dollar. Seems to be a bit naïve, I know as someone that traveled more than most; technology consultant. There is a new normal and as technology has grown, travel and hotels will shrink.

I suspect people will be cautious and not blow what value they have built up now that the election is over and the Democrats have used their dog whistle to let the media know that they can now change the direction of the COVID conversation.
I’m younger than millennials lol
This made me laugh

You could always hedge with some shares that you end up selling for a loss to roll out your options that you end up 💎 handing to zero, but at least your felt like you made a good choice at one point in your life.

Nah I’ve always said fuck her everyone that follows her is a simp
You could argue that someone like Cathie would be one of the perfect people to talk about this subject.  The companies of Twitter, Google, Facebook, etc are inextricably tied to their outstanding shares.  That's just facts.  

If nothing else, these are huge companies that make up a large part of a lot of indices, so what happens to them has a lot of bearing on the market.  So you're saying that she should just not consider any of this?  Just, you know, just ignore any market research, and the possibility that their current course of action is one that might be detrimental to their bottom line?  Any of that click with you?
Dude...

Maybe bullish for clean energy?
I thought the same thing when ARKK was at $90
I'm pretty sure he didn't end up having to pay that -50k as robinhood chalked it up to "R&D" costs for finding the exploit lol. He's probably fine and learned his lesson to stay far away from here, unlike the rest of us.

Hi, im new to the stock market and out of the loop. Why are GME shares going to rocket?
[deleted]
I notice it at different places. Last week was working in a government building and still smelling it. Fuckin weird
Market opens
$ARK stuff
So do you remember when Amazon said they were getting into healthcare to fix it three ish years ago cuz that was the hot topic? They just dropped the initiative a few weeks ago

Companies “get into the market” all the time cuz it’s the hot topic.

This could easily pivot to Apple selling a car OS and apps and shit to all the ev providers who will def need that. That would be way more in line with their strengths and align with how they currently interact with their customers
Hey guys, when this thing skyrockets what is the time window to cash out? Like a day or a few minutes or what ? On my commute to work I hit like a 20 minute window when I have no cell service ... I don’t want it to rocket while I cant sell lol
WSB for life!!!
got mine at 0.9
fair enough
This ☝🏼! Once the squeeze hath squoze, GME will return to fair market value and price will reflect GME as a renewed growth company.
She went political, never go political.
looks terrible
Get in so far that 220 is holding as the bottom
Well this is an unprecedented bull market and also the boomers had enough wealth handed to them that a few percent per year was often enough to live off of, so risk wasn't necessary to meet their goals
Been a GME og since October. GME might be a wait and see stock now. The moon mission is already in place and can only go so much higher. 🚀🚀🚀. I’m not a bear I promise. I totally advocate sinking your entire life savings into this company but wait a little bit. Also don’t forget that NOK and BB exist. Just saying
Lol what do you mean wrong bank connection seems like you tried using some one else’s bank

GME👻👻👻👻
"News" from last Thursday. Did feye explode on Friday? Same as solar, and other sectors mentioned in proposal?
That would be fine with me but yeah it depends how hardcore her stance is.. do we know how she tends to slant politically or just in general on issues? I feel like she’s a smart person so it should translate to politics but we all know tons of people where that’s not the case lol 

Unless it’s common sense sort of stuff I’d rather her stay out of it

Surely this means that at least one or more companies are fuk, but I don't know which ones.
I’m so fucking bored
You should probably go ahead and get fitted for one of those helmets.
Just a logic check here:

You can buy options to speculate and you can sell options without hedging. I myself have sold countless puts on GameStop over the past two years without hedging - just using cash as collateral.  It’s a great way to enter a (long) position.

Near expiration, the put buyer can always sell the ITM puts to somebody with actual shares if they don’t have them, or just buy shares prior to expiration at the lower price to settle an ITM contract.

OTM, just the premiums trade hands and nothing else happens.
I JUST DID NOT BELIEVE MAN

I'm a little worried about my moms.  She reads a bunch of stuff online and she sent me a text yesterday that she truly believes trump is still going to be president and that I need to get cash out the bank, have enough food for two weeks, get my prescriptions up to date because the left is going to freak out once he is still president.

I can't stand sleepy Joe and I'm a hardcore fiscal conservative but Jesus what are some people reading online?  I also think many people don't realize the president is a president, not king.
Shit, what’s the conversion rate to Stanley Nickles?
Yeah but I imagine BB will do a short squeeze on Tuesday like it did for Friday so I’m planning to get in a market open and then get out but I’ll have to play it by ear.

She’s in a black pea coat that you bought her for Christmas years ago. She looked fantastic then, and she looks fantastic now. If only you’d kept buying her clothes instead of calls.

“When can I see them?” Your kids have been at your mother-in-law’s for weeks, and you can’t show your face there. “Stop. Have you signed yet?” She pulls a red pen from her purse. Red, like your portfolio.

“I lost them.”

She brushes by you and leans over your computer. You can smell her when she goes by, and you wish you could bottle it before it’s gone forever.

A few moments later you hear mechanical whirring.

hey retard day trade limits only apply if you're buying and selling the same thing in the same day

if you buy one day and sell a different day, it doesn't count against you at all
what is "all of it"
Can I just say that I FUCKING love the fact that we are banding together over Gamestop of all companies in the world.  Most of us as kids and some of the young people here probably have fond memories of buying games or standing outside one for a midnight release party.    


I hope to hell they turn this company around and charge forth into the digital world and make a bunch of retard virgin nerds rich as fuck.  Or at least break even from all the terrible trade-ins.
I don't care if she's right or wrong, she's MONEY
Hoping it happens at all lol. Fingers crossed
If your loading up on GME Tuesday morning are you setting your purchase now or waiting till market opens to purchase?
There is this DMV in Nebraska that will cash them for you

Brady just called, how you want that dick served?
Everyone go buy a PS5 for your damn step kids and your wife’s bf.
I feel like the language also helps make sure posts aren't coming from firms' comms departments. If it got out that a company was posting with that kind of language, it could be bad for them.

It would follow that some (most) of the DD here is an attempt to pump and dump.

Some of it is likely organized. I have made the mistake of touching stocks mentioned here, but I think in general you should avoid at all costs.

That includes GME and BB. Y'all are going to get fucked.

I don't have any delusions of grandeur here, but I'm sure that it is not lost on him that we have accelerated his plan to become profitable. I'm sure he'll throw us a bone without it being obvious. Exactly the same reason I'm confident he's not going to propose more share to satisfy shorts. We propped this up, not the shorts. If he has any loyalty to stupid investors, it's us and I think that dumb and dumber meme proved it.

Yeah but now there are multiple companies out there that are offering more for that price and have been around for a minute. 

Of course apple will sell vehicles based on their name alone but looking at people who are looking for a decent electric vehicle for the price I don't think apple will be there for a few years yet.

GME is banana overvalued you autist tardknock sell sell sell
he tweeted a week before in that case. So, I wouldn't get too excited about tomorrow. This will take as long as it Cohen wants it to, as soon as he does something with a positive catalyst the shorts are fucked into infinite.

What’s on Tuesday
Song chosen to send subliminal message confirmed. So basically Buy Feb 19 calls since (second :19) states the hint of a "million miles")
The song lyrics mention ‘one million miles’ which is what I believe OP is getting at.

The reality is these batteries will likely do 2 million miles plus, so the whole ‘million mile battery’ is really not the most important metric when determining battery ability.
nah man. limit orders probably are necessary for OPTIONS where the bid/ask can be large. For stocks where it's $0.01 it makes literally no difference -- just use market orders because limit orders for stocks is legit penny-pinching and can make you miss some big moves.

It was a week for GME and BB and you decide to go with Tesla.
Just imagine the kind of retard you must be to bet against Cathie. Cathie knows DA WHEY 🚀
Yes, but it'll be like 35 => 500 =>50. Itll go down at some point but ppl buying now bought at 35 and will get a chance to sell mondo high so who cares?

Oi! Shut up, you shill. Noticed the tweet from Cohen? Your shorts about to burst, buddy
No, but this is WSB and apparently we're not here to make money but we're here to make sure that we're ethical with our stocks. Buying Chinese stocks might make us a ton of tendies but that's not why we're here. We're here to morally grandstand.

Hi wallstreetbettybums! How we all doing?!
You probably think girls who make 500K a year on OnlyFans are smart because they can make money. A smart person is a well rounded individual who is exceptionally good at their craft. Bringing up Parler in the same sentence as “free speech” is pretty fucking stupid. 

Retard.

You mean there's no way the SEC could pin any intentional manipulation onto him, because even a sub with a million autists can't figure out what it means?
So do we want WSB to be like the rest of Reddit where you can only post things people agree with or not?

Do you actually think I'm proofreading every post here and only approving the things I think are 100% based in fact or that I agree with? Would you actually want that?

Dude you’re proving my point with your own stance on the matter. Believe it or not people disagree and it’s a point of a contention. She’s a fund manager and should stick to doing tendies. Commenting on politics introduces risk because those with opposite views may sell on that basis (and those sharing her views will still sell fearing the uncertain reaction)
If cathie said to invest in dirt I’d go outside and deposit it into a safety deposit box right away
It indicates inflation. Which means that all future guidance is now lowered relative to today’s dollar because inflation will go up. Companies have to raise guidance to account for future growth because there is more liquidity in the world. If they keep the same guidance it means they’re actually lowering it. Value doesn’t have that issue because most companies are market saturated and know what their earnings are which is why they can afford to give dividends

Dollar is stronger now. Let’s borrow more wtf 🤷‍♂️

The dollar held late-week gains on Monday as softening U.S. economic data and rising coronavirus cases turned investors cautious.

Against a basket of currencies the dollar hovered around a one-month high of 90.887 hit in early trade and the mood also supported the safe-haven yen against other majors.

Better yet use Limit Orders, with a good until cancelled feature.  If you’re brokerage offers this your limit order will remain open for up to 60 days or until it is filled at your limit price.

I’d love to see it hit $1000, and know I missed out on some serious scratch, but I still have my limits set starting at around $400, and selling off 10% of my stock at every $100 bump after that.

My thought process is I don’t wanna miss that crazy squeeze if it happens, but if it doesn’t hit those numbers I can always manually sell after the rocket ride on the way down if it doesn’t hit those incredibly autistic targets.

God speed, retards.

🥜🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

(Before anybody gets mad, just know me selling 10 shares per target isn’t going to save the shorts, I’ve only got a few thousand in this. Bears are still fucked)
1. I'm not mad. I'm unhappy that an investment has the potential to decline in value.
2. I think she's right.

  

It's not either/or, it's OK to think both.
I’m not saying it’s a good thing, I’m saying it’s a real thing.
No rebuttal to what exactly? That there shouldn't be a war bc I don't own a gun? 🤡
Fucking idiot thinks we're too stupid to understand that he cherry-picked his numbers to make GME look bad because it is a cyclical stock. We are at the new cycle, growth is here and will continue

The premium on calls is really high right now.  The value is in holding shares.  You could sell $10 puts for a \~20% return on capital. Or, you could buy shares and sell puts to reduce your cost basis.

Correct me if I'm wrong but I don't see that making limit orders is possible on robinhood.
...what? People want the most out of their investments, that’s literally the reason we invest.

Taxes would reduce the amount of profit you would make, so it makes sense to sell **beforehand.**
But the important part is consumer spending which fell

*From 1926 to 2019, we have had a Republican president for 46 years, and a Democratic president for 48 years. The difference in returns between the parties is pretty stark. The average annual return for the S&P 500 index when we had a Republican President was 9.12%. When we had a Democratic President, the S&P 500 average 14.94% per year.*
no, I want a free country where technocrats arent silencing the people they disagree with. Does the Chinese government punish companies for not allowing people to speak freely? I believe it actually does the opposite
I'm so sorry to hear about your loss.  Having loved ones pass away can leave a huge hole in your chest that takes a long time to recover from.  My thoughts are with you and your friend's family.

Not true, GME has less float out then Volkswagen taking into account institutions and Cohen.

>52% in institution that wont sell, 20% in Cohen and co, 5-15% in board and insiders leaves 23% of the float available, less than Volkswagen.

If you believe fintel, institutions alone own 163% of the float. Institutions don't sell so how will they unwind?

There's a reason he's talking about selling in increments of $1,000.
I’ll be nice and clue you in. Ryan Cohen tweeted 🥜 thats it

Not necessarily. ETFs can collapse for other reasons relating to the health of the institution that created them.

Also, check out the history of XIV. It was a volatility ETF that collapsed, and not because VIX collapsed but rather the opposite.

Funding secured.  Price too high.  I'm ok with that
Cathie's upset they censored her boy Donnie Pump
Oh I see. Yeah i definitely meant when it goes back to $40. They are definitely expecting us to go straight down
idk, the rest of the world (mostly EU) are not impressed with the actions of TWTR, GOOG and AMZN.  They are actually introducing legislation making censorship illegal.  But Cathie is putting herself out there to be a target of MSM
They censor a lot of stuff, it's ridiculous. They don't like the real truth about the markets. Only 1% yearly gains.

Yo, for real though...how long will it take to unwind 70MM short positions?  
I personally don't think it will be a replay of VW bc of share supply in the market.  Melvin will tempt paper handed bitches in the market in chunks to sell off and it won't be a violent move up.  Most likely it will be gradual, if a squeeze happens.
yes
I almost want to just take it down
The CEO and CFO of ARK funds making a political statement that has the potential to affect her ETF prices should be fair game, *as long as the comments are made within the context of the funds*. Otherwise, yeah, keep purely political comments out please.

Dude, the pattern reading may have some astrological value for a settled company. Gamestop is evolvi . Even our retard group put some thought into it and came up with some terrific ideas for where RC may take it. It will go up. The shorts will try to push down and dog their hole deeper.

You guys should look up some southeast Asian places. In Bangkok there was 2 whole floors of their mall reserved for dope ass PC components, mainly because they are so close to the China factories.

It only makes sense that those stores would eventually find their way here, and now that covid forced the west to modernize, everyone is getting pcs like never before for kids in school, working from home, etc...

[“GME’s board shake-up and stronger holiday sales is causing a long-buying tsunami, which is the primary factor for the price move,” Dusaniwsky said in emailed comments. “While I agree that we are seeing some shorts squeezed out of their positions due to massive mark-to-market losses today, this is much like the chicken-and-egg question – did long buying lead to short covering\squeeze or short covering\squeeze lead to long buying?”
Dusaniwsky believes it’s the former.
“We will not be seeing a massive drop in shares shorted over the next few days, more like a 10%-20% drop which would mean 7 to 14 million of shares covered, which is nowhere near the almost 70 million shares traded this morning,” the analyst said. “Long buyers are the primary force driving GME’s stock price up. “](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/gamestop-stock-soars-60-in-apparent-short-squeeze-11610559366)

XOP is the 4th largest refiner in the US. There will be implications for them I believe. However, they will pass through the costs to Canadian producers since XOP can import heavy oil from Mexico and Canadian producers don’t have many options. Refine in Canada which doesn’t have enough refining capacity to deal with all the production.

Eat your cunt sandwich and buy calls. TSLA $900 EoW
When can I buy shares!!?? Should I wait until 1030 Tuesday or ASAP opening?
LOL, you are majorly asleep bud. GTFO off this sub
> So, you sold one contract and are going to buy another one from someone else? Or are you saying that you tried to sell at 400 but the best offer that got linked to your contract 'ended up being 293?

I bought a contract, held it for a day (1/14 AM to 1/15 AM) and then sold it for $400. After $BB went down on 1/15 throughout the day, the contract got cheaper so I'm looking at re-buying it for $293. 

>I'll keep this in mind, thx. Also, what if say BB just keeps slow and steady climbing and I see the contract the whole way through? At that point I just have the right to buy the shares at my original price? Or is the purchase automatic?

contract means you can buy 100 shares at the strike price any time between now and when it expires. So like for my 6/18 10c, it means I can buy 100 shares for $10 any time between now and 6/18, regardless of the stock price.

If you don't have enough cash in your account to execute the contract then you sell it and collect the premium. RH does this automatically 1 hour before the end of trading on the expiry date, other platforms may do it differently. Or just watch it and do it yourself, that way you don't end up leaving profits on the table if it starts that last day high and ends low like 1/15 for instance. I had a 8.5c 1/15 that I sold five minutes after the market opened for a healthy profit, I would have made a lot less if I let RH do it for me.
What did she tweet? She needs to buy more PLTR before my call expires.
plz arkk dip so i can load tf up

Not a boomer, I think this post is unfair and largely ignorant. If you’re a boomer (60+) you absolutely want safety. Vanguard and Fidelity boring ass 5% a year delta. You would be absolutely insane to expose your nested egg to any violent fluctuations so close to retirement age. A young person can lose their asses repeatedly and ngaf, because 1) the have 50+ years to recover 2) can find or train for a new job 3) if you don’t have any experience trading you can assume this is how the market always works. But anyone who has been investing for the last two decades or 2 have seen our 401k cut by 2/3 and have seen many friends and acquaintances lose it all.
I’m not furious about her stance, I just think it’s probably gonna have negative business consequences

This stock is one of the easiest buys you can ever make for guaranteed gains. I’ve been pumping it since $10 and will continue to do so until it hits $100 by the end of this year. 

Space is only going to become more lucrative as time goes on and maxar is the strongest space company that’s currently public.

Buying such short term out of the money options with all of your money is just insane to me especially after a massive pump. How is that possible, it honestly seems you go so greedy that you bought so short term and out of the money each time when you could have easily made money with 99% of other strategy’s it seems even the same strategy. You just seemed to alway buy the exact top too. As some one who felt gme was too easy money to make it’s hard to understand how some people take a rocket shit so serious and fomo everything

The comment that you replied to mentioned watching fib levels at 46, 51, 57,59  and if the stock goes to $70 all bets are off.

Your reply said if it “goes back to $40.”  Thought you were stating if it comes back down to 40 from 46,51,57,59, 70.... just misunderstood what you were implying.

I'll be awake and staring at my phone come market open Tuesday AM regardless, if there's an opportunity to save some cash on the premium and end up with a higher % return then I'm about it.
One thing I want to add. During the flash crash, the bids-offers weren’t real when the market dipped. 

We might see that here as well. What we see as bid ask spreads may not be what is executed, esp with shitty dealers like RH. 

Be careful with your executions. A lot of risk there during a volatile squeeze.

Oh no!
Thats why it cant go tits up
It's actually the other way round

* SpaceX purchased $1 million worth of “battery components” from Tesla in 2019. It also purchased $1.2 million more of those components in the first quarter of 2020.

* SpaceX also purchased “non-battery vehicle parts” from Tesla in 2019 and the first quarter of 2020, the filing says. The car parts were standard items out of Tesla’s parts catalog, the kind any regular auto shop or Tesla service center would need to complete repairs. Sales of Tesla car parts to SpaceX amounted to $600,000 in 2019, and $600,000 in the first quarter of 2020 alone.

* SpaceX is also paying Tesla around $700,000 for a custom tool, which the automaker will build at its machining facility. (The price included labor hours, Tesla noted.)

* Tesla Energy sold a system to SpaceX for $300,000 in 2019.
Alright if we want to get specific, this feels like a bit over 13 years ago, before Project Chanology attracted a bunch of awkward 14 year olds who wanted to be l33t hax0rs and make the news.

This short squeeze with GME may very well turn into WSB's Project Chanology. Here's hoping media coverage is minimal.

By her tweet she’s clearly against censorship... Point is she just shouldn’t confirm either position in this environment. She is introducing manager risk to the funds. Should stick to the tendie thing not political commentary
248.23 now
So even if the underlying aren’t performing, if people are loading up on shares/calls of the ETF, it could still climb or atleast stay propped up rather than dump?
Risk tolerance is different for everyone. There's value there IMO with possibility of some crazy market mechanics for spice. There's inherent risk in that regardless of what ppl here meme. I'm on the low end of risk tolerance for the most part but I'm semi autistic enough to want in on the fun. I'm not in the "Fuck it, all in to the moon!" crowd but Oponn's pull to those who are.

My crew has been using a lot more boral the last couple years. It’s easier to cut than AZEK and doesn’t shrink as much. Boral also makes siding, so they are pumping out a lot more product.

It's value inside a squeeze. It will go up due to fundamentals and good changes, and eventually this will kill the shorts.
[deleted]
Hey, thank you for this info. If I may, I have a few follow up questions:

> I had 6/18 10c on $BB that I sold for $400 on Friday on the second peak and I have a buy queued up for it on Tuesday AM for $293 lol

So, you sold one contract and are going to buy another one from someone else? Or are you saying that you tried to sell at 400 but the best offer that got linked to your contract 'ended up being 293?

>also the shorter the expiry on the call the more volatile it can be, so don't be a paper handed retard and sell at the first sign of trouble.

I'll keep this in mind, thx. Also, what if say BB just keeps slow and steady climbing and I see the contract the whole way through? At that point I just have the right to buy the shares at my original price? Or is the purchase automatic?
Squeeze event seems imminent regardless but if he buys 7% that makes the ratio of float to available even great which would just exaggerate the squeeze
You can’t run in a straight line? What are you, a snake?
why?
There's also a German r/antstreetbets (r/ameisenstrassenwetten unsurprisingly) for the growing autist who wants to dlne his Taschengeld. There's a lot of German "we're another subreddit but without English words".

Right, and Parler allowed anybody to say anything. Right wing extremists are being penalized for what they have said on Parler.

To get one of those check marks next to your name you had to submit a picture of your driver’s license. The people threatening violence **should be, and are being persecuted.**

However, penalizing an entire platform is monopolistic behavior.

The overqualified problem.
Power member here and I’m waiting for my Series X preorders, and with my tendies I got my daughter some plushies (Bulbasaur and Pikachu).

They have one lone 3DS I wanted to buy used and that’s gone now. They have more consoles in the case and daily checks show they’re rotating heavily. Store is almost always full during normal hours and whether you like it or not, people love cute official merch. If they get any preowned switches I’m all over it so my wife and I can play AC:NH together and leave my daughter with an island full of hidden messages for her to find if my heart explodes on a GME MOASS

Fuckers have been sold out of Pokémon cards for weeks and I’m not gonna be my dumb self buying them from 99c stores anymore. I usually sell all my duplicates which nets me more than the price of each pack, and keep just one in case I get another Black Charizard kill.
Exactly
It feels like they all just got scammed on a colossal scale. Like, I'm retarded and still am up 55% for the year after losing like 1K on Friday. They must have been lied to up and down the street about investing.
Farmers have been getting handouts since the Great Depression. Corporate bailouts are not a new idea. Spit on my 🥜🥜

Do i buy $BB FD's on the canadian market?
Mainly because the squeeze depends on tying up as many shares as possible so the shorts can't cover. We need every share we can have to make this happen. Honestly if I could buy a call I'd probably would but most of my money would be in shares anyway. Also even if you put in just a little, a X10 is nothing to laugh at. You'll get plenty of opportunities to make options/leaps plays with the money you got from GME shares, don't worry and don't be too greedy. :)
I’m going full retard on $GME dropping $15k on market open. Gonna ride straight to $200 sell and then buy on the next dip.

Out on BB. Why, you ask? Short not huge and float relatively big. Already overvalued. Concentrate on GME that’s where we can do real damage due to low float and HUGE short interest. Keep it simple stupid.

I'm still a bit confused but the bottom line is buy before Tuesday afternoon and sell at your own peril basically? me sorry me caveman.

Thanks cathie luv u
What cathie do?
This is bad for Canadian producers. Just means it is going to cost them more to get oil to major refining / export in the gulf coast (ie. Canadian differential will stay wide). It is bad for refiners because they have adjusted their refineries to use Canadian oil as diluent (blending light oil from Texas to get to refining grade). It is bad for those states that appose the pipeline because it is going down there by rail anyway which is a more dangerous was to transport oil.

Having money doesn’t make you smart. You do realize that right?
You buying?
Brrr is absolutely harmful. Question is there are so many zombie firms and companies relying on 0 interest rates to survive, how can you get out of this? Do you let a cleansing with hundreds/thousands of companies going bankrupt but the actual profitable ones remaining? On paper yes. In practice, monetary/fiscal policy won’t ever allow a downturn it seems. 
What did he say the harmful aspects are? Of the top of my Head is the obvious asset price inflation
No expiry... shitty bot
Poppa bless 💎
Fucking Christ go back to regular reddit I fucking hate you
you can sell your contracts at any time as long as there's a buyer for them. I had 6/18 10c on $BB that I sold for $400 on Friday on the second peak and I have a buy queued up for it on Tuesday AM for $293 lol


optimal point to exit is the peak, good luck figuring out when that is. 

also the shorter the expiry on the call the more volatile it can be, so don't be a paper handed retard and sell at the first sign of trouble.
All in on shares and $200 leaps

The premium/discount is the difference between the underlying price and current price due to buyers/sellers.
Reminder of this [DD for GME](https://youtu.be/alntJzg0Um4) from this sub's very own.
specially for batteries. It looks like Tesla is going to manufacture every EV battery in the market.
Shhhh shhhh it’s okay I have them too but I am selling after I make 100%. It was for fun anyways...just the tip
Yeah seriously this a pit of degeneracy since when are we acting all fucking lovey dovey. All this new influx is bringing “feelings”. Ladies and gentlemen this is a casino you check that shit at the door.

So let me get this straight:

Autist sells a set of calls, collects the premium. Now he owns the premiums because in a sense, they “exercised” immediately. Now that he owns the premiums, he needs to give the shares back to the contracts he “wrote” and if the price explodes, he’s basically losing on the difference of the call strikes he chose, versus where they could be when the contracts expire.

That’s what makes a call option a bear strategy in this scenario. Right?
This is the way

you just wanted some awards, i’m retarded but not stupid , lol
If the IV is high when you purchase the option that means the stock mooning is to some degree already priced in to the option, which means it has to moon even more than expected in order to break even and make money. It also means you run the risk of the IV decreasing at any point and the option losing value even if the price of the stock doesn’t move or moons less than expected.

Think of IV as supply and demand. If shit goes against you then the demand for that call will go down therefore premiums will go down. That’s just a simple way of looking at it.

Agree but I suspect twitter mob is coining for her head.
ohhh okay i gotcha. So, if RC comes through next week and we find out he has bought a higher stake in the company, this is a possible squeeze event?
> Buy shares with cash not margin. Hold shares forever unless RC dies (Shame hes a cybernetic demigod), Melvin bad, Shorts fuk, 🐻 🌈  posting bearish shit are doing weeklies for the second time after they expired red on friday, GME to $200 without squeeze, Ryan cohen a god, GME is still a value play, Good luck have fun.

Basically: BUY GME SHARES AND HOLD.

When the only wrinkle in your brain tells you to sell you smooth it out ok champ?
I bought GME puts last week like a traitor and I deserve what is happening to me.
Steam charges game devs 30% to sell a game on Steam.

Epic charges 15%.

Neither offer used game sales. There are valid reasons for this, but that would take too long here.

I see these particular points as ripe for attack.

If a storefront came along that offered to take only 10%, and allowed consumers to sell your digital game keys back to the store, so they could resell them as 'used', devs could get a small cut of this as well, and as long as GS kept prices in line with somewhat current Steam/Epic sales costs, they'd be running a perpetual sale essentially.

In short, it is not farfetched that they could create a storefront that let devs make more, and consumers participate in a secondary market that was widely crushed when digital distribution took over PC gaming.

Add a decent UI, and actual customer service........

I'd use it.

But if they won't or can't buy ( say the price is 1k) , then it doesn't go up further i guess. But on their side, I would be looking towards bankruptcy protection.   It wouldn't be unprecedented ( lehman bear)  but I'm not sure what exactly happens then too the holders.

Very interesting, but still so confused. Any help would be appreciated. I’ve been out of interest for a few years now but getting introduced again. So far I’m learning is the day to look for is Tuesday but what time( I’m CST). Also is it just pretty much buying the shares and holding for 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 or do I do something specific on Robinhood.

I remember when FB did their IPO and I wasn’t totally sure if it was going to win and be the dominant social media company over Twitter and SnapChat (I know, I’m dumb).  In hindsight, I should have poured money into FB... but it didn’t seem obvious at the time. 

PLTR feels that way to me today. I’m ready to ride this 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

It’s only at 3,500 though for 100 shares. Not a bad rate for such high premiums

I've been a long time creeper of wsb because of my admiration for understanding economics, math and really anything numbers oriented (I'm more creative, love to write, all that bullshit). As someone who has no stocks, and doesn't understand this stuff at all (I've never tried trading due to being terrified) I get so overwhelmed. My ass would have to google "how to buy stock" before I even could try. I'm assuming, after reading the post, and scanning comments, that I shouldn't bother trying to get on this train... Even if I have money what do I do, open an etrade account and just buy shares? It can't be that simple right? Feel free to downvote me to oblivion I probably deserve it...

I sell the 35c for profit when we hit $39-41, and if we suddenly moon, I’m gonna put paper clips on my nipples if those somehow end up ATM/ITM and the premiums let me moonwalk on my dad’s opinions of dividends and “needing money to make money”.

I appreciate your effort of sharing this, but you extremely overcomplicate things and it seems that you really have paper hands. In this situation you could simply advise a debit spread, or precisely, a reverse iron butterfly. This won't lose you time on management and save on commissions and interest. If you are balls deep in stocks and are limited in pdt - just enter a protective collar on those stocks for the time being. Good enough for both cash and margin accounts. Keep it simple.

I know you want this thing to pop and to make some extra dollars, but I’d encourage you to be less of an emotional and “bought in” to your ideas.

There is $0 in revenue right now, a ton of overhead, and debt. You’re buying on speculative future value rather than today’s value. 

That’s the market condition we’re in right now, but that will not last forever. Greenspan referred to this as “irrational exuberance” during the bubble he presided over.

Newsflash. Debt doesn't matter. It's been going up for years, decades in fact. Nobody gives a fuck when your economy's booming through the fucking roof.

To strengthen my point, he basically stole market share also from AMZN by winning in the customer service department while amazon went into negative margins to try and beat them out, they failed. I trust RC because chewy is becoming a giant and it shares some similarities.  The good thing is that while it might not be as a success as chewy compared to the market sizes GME doesnt have to do as well to get larger revenues!

I agree the large user base and CRM data from years of gaming could be leveraged a lot to kickstart RC. We will have to wait and see but I am very bullish!
Stonks go up
Oh yeah sorry I’m talking about GME. Thanks!
Biden rejoining Paris Agreement first day in office. Can't get more bullish in renewables than that.

Idk if your comments are sarcastic lot of 🌈🐻out rn but I do think they are decent plays. I think Apple should run up til earnings.
I wish I was rich enough to somehow make that scene happen
Prob should throw it away
Australian and New Zealand almost closed for the day and are down quite a bit.
Uh oh!! https://twitter.com/CathieDWood/status/1350980096132337666
instead of writing shitty posts, he can go buy more GME
Transfer of wealth to the masses to the top. Trickle up baby!
Sometimes I pull shit completely out of my ass when talking about GME.

A couple of days ago someone asked what would happen if GME sold some shares directly to Melvin to cover - **I fucking LIED and made up some shit “Oh they can’t do that, it’s illegal and would need to be declared” or some shit.**

The best part is that anyone who disagreed with me and pointed out how **THEY COULD INFACT DO THAT** was downvoted into oblivion instantly and I got like 30 upvotes for total **bullshit.**

#You’re all retarded
Obama didn't add debt. Bush added that debt because he left the county in the middle of a war and a recession.
Nah. That contract just ain't it. 139C AAPL? Come on.
A flaming green week next week would be amazing.
keystone XL pipeline cancellation gonna nuke my Exxon calls ???
Yeah but is keystone xl being cancelled necessarily bullish for ICLN?
What happened

Edit: ahh fuck Cathie is being a social media person no stop
Good bot
I assume you're talking about GME, if so shares are better but calls wouldn't hurt although IV is pretty high right now so theyre expensive
I think the packers are just going to steamroll everybody this postseason

Why does he actually say “i yolo weeklys”
They were held against their will as much as you are held against your will by WSB. They were dirt poor girls shown a lifestyle that they could only dream of and then told do as told or it will all end and they can go back to their trailers. Few in that situation will have the willpower to say no just like you cant say no to tendies. Manipulative Yes. Kidnapping No.

Doctor here seen a few babies with covid and in the neonatal icu doing terribly (thankfully not many). Seen a few young healthy adults just got hit hard by covid19 without any major medical history. Hear about these the most because it's the most relatable to the medical staff/team

And of course, several older patients or mid age patients with prior medical issues. Don't hear about these anymore cause it's just become so common now.
I think MLK wanted to say "Let the NYSE bell ring" instead of let freedom ring.

You also got to remember the economy was completely shutdown in the spring so you'd expect to see improvement in the overall economy but we are not at pre-covid levels yet and were pretty much in a recession until we reach those levels. Recent economic  indicators are suggesting the economy is slowing again.

I agree with your comment. You could absolutely be correct.

But imagine that every time a kid and their parents went into a gamestop, they saw a PC building kiosk. Imagine that seed planted in their minds, the exposure to the PC world it entails. Imagine how many new PC users something like that could grow into.

Think about how ads work. When you see an ad a bunch of times, and people start talking about said new product, if you were on the fence about it the idea starts becoming more interesting. A lot of people take the plunge when this happens.

It could absolutely be a massive game changer. No one has anything like it. Just because no one has done it, doesn't mean it's a terrible idea(I'm not saying that it isn't, rather that it doesn't automatically mean what you have stated). Think about all of the things which had never been done before that have made people massive amounts of money, that seem silly. This could be one of those things.
Im not really interested in actually excersizing it, as I am poor. Im thinkin that even if the stock jumps 5% the call option will be worth more, or am i retarded

I am glad a lot of you have done well investing in GME, but all I can think about when seeing a DD about GME is that I’m not sure which I prefer more - shopping at a GameStop store or getting a root canal.  GameStop’s retail stores are a dreadful experience for the customer.

/u/zjz he complimented you
I'm an idiot I just saw the Papa part and went to Elon's account and was like what are these tards talking about its just a bunch of spacex stuff.
  Pretty obvious he's saying the price rise is peanuts compared to what's coming. Thing is with  RC taking over I don't think the Short % is going to be as big and hence  less likely to squeeze. I'd abandon the short if a hotshot founder from another company came and tried to turn things around. It's no longer on the BB path like it was when Sherman was running things.
bb literally cant go tits up
A financial advice disclaimer, followed by a prediction that BB will 10x over the weekend while the market is closed. True retard.

Read the post, youll see you are wrong.
There will be no prison time. That’s fucking dumb. They just want you to cover your deposit. Might even get to keep the profits. However if you can’t cover the deposit then definitely count on your profits being retracted as well. This is not entirely different than a margin call. Expect a fee as well for using the wrong fucking bank.

Interesting, I thought digital coins go up for the same reason taht stonks go up, with is the low interest rates. bc money printer casuses asset price inflation across asset classes, and especially in high risk assets like both tech cos and small caps and digital coins. 

So My thought was that it might be a good time to get out of your digital coins at the same time as stocks.
rats are really fucking smart....

Again, remember everybody, if we are red this week, it’ll be because of apprehension about inauguration. As long as everything goes well, we will be green bigly. The chances of things going well are extremely high, so don’t worry about any red we see before then

Massively undervalued for a player in the cyber security market, huge room for growth at a significantly lower risk for loss considering GME is massively peaked already
So you're saying we're going to the sun? 🚀🚀
The higher it goes the more money shorts lose. If they realize the stock isn't going to 0 anymore...(they should have when Cohen came in and brought chewy members on) they will want to exit their shorts.

To exit their shorts they need to buy GME shares to cover their shorts.

Climbing out and all the way until gear down, just ridiculous severe turbulence.  Plane is rocking and rolling all over the sky, pretty much everyone on the plane pukes.  Someone across the aisle from me gets up to get another puke bag, FAs are strapped in and are screaming at them to sit down, cracks their head on the ceiling during an especially severe jolt.  

Finally, the FAs relent, they are crawling on their hands and knees up and down the aisle passing out more puke bags, plastic bags, basically anything which can hold vomit as the plane won't stop juking and jiving all over the sky.  Pilot comes on the PA, says he's tried every altitude between 28 and 38 thousand feet; apologizes (hey, pilot cannot control the weather) asks for our patience and to hang on.

By this point, I'm already turning green and the smell of all the puke in the cabin makes me want to hurl too.  But I don't.  Cause the woman sitting next to me is a stone cold fox and I'm gonna not let myself puke in front of her.
That's how its done

For what it is worth the overwhelming majority of FED individual voters believe that interest rates would be raised in 2023 and that the economy needed greater support before it happened. I think only 1 or 2 people said raise rates in 2022. That said, J Pow has acted quickly in the past and I do believe by late 2021 we will see encouraging signs of economic growth that doesnt necessarily need low interest rates any longer. Unemployment will improve too I would think by EoY so probably not a bad strategy at all. Sell off for small profits in shaky positions and hold only what you deeply trust and have a good position in.

To me, this is bullish for digital coins and when interest rates gets raised people will rotate into it exploding back half of 2021 at the earliest but likely 2022 and 2023
i always feel like im not making enough plays.

i have tons of options for this year, 2022 and even starting 2023.

but still.

its never enough..always looking for the next thing.

Really well done, was actually thinking these would make good meme material awhile back !
I believe this is precisely what the Shorters are banking on: double down on their shorts, shake off these in-experienced retail investors to the point where they are all almost on margin call because they yolo'd way too hard, and then it loses meme-appeal 1-2 months down the road because the Autists all found the net meme (PLTR).

&#x200B;

They have the capital, expertise and media connections (manipulation) to keep going with the shorting. It truly is their last play. How it unfolds, will either be a paradigm shift in terms of how the game is now played via retail investors or show that WSB and the power of "group think" is only as strong as the weakest most paper handed margin calling yolo'n Autist in the group. I prey for the former. 🚀
Sorry, I meant January 2022. I forgot we are in 2021

Thank you. I will ask them.
Why am I getting downvoted I’m asking a serious question.
Can you please explain further how the insane volume last week defended against a squeeze? Obviously something strange must be going on to trade 100m shares in a day when there’s only 69m outstanding, but my little autist brain just isn’t comprehending the mechanics of what was happening there.

Absolutely fantastic post and I’ve never been more excited for a market open. That part about price targets in multiples of 1000 is going to keep me up tonight. Godspeed brothers
what is DD
Is there a strategy to buying at open? Versus right now?
My 1/29 133c and 139c hope to god

I went to a doctor this past year to have my testicle checked for cancer. I found lumps. They weren’t cancer, but the doc squeezed them so fucking hard he injured them and I developed hydroceles. Absurdly painful. Attorney said I didn’t have a case against the doctor because it didn’t require surgery to correct, it just took 10 painful weeks to heal. It really sucked. Thank you for coming to my Ted talk. Be careful who you let touch your balls.
Got a feeling they are going to dip a little this week.

I know this sub likes to keep it light hearted and autistic but that sucks bro and I hope you're able to wrap your head around it and move on. Dont get to caught up in the cudda wudda shudda mindset.

Probably worth mentioning Burry is shorting Tesla.
Not a boomer retard....going to make any other wrong guesses fuckstick?
I live in jersey but things are not good here
Therein lies another problem though...

Does one set a low amount like 200 or 400, or closer to an unimaginable number like 1k or more?

Would be pretty shit to miss out on massive money by being conservative if this thing goes ballistic, but at the same time you would still make a huge amount. I guess it's just one of those things which really tells you the size of your balls.
So I use fidelity as my brokerage. The other day I logged into my Robinhood acct after not logging in for years (got locked out after getting a new phone number). Was hoping I invested in TSLA back in the day. Nope. $0 in robinhood acct lmao. A piece of me wants to pick a random stock, invest, then log out of robinhood and check again in 2 years time.
im thinking baout selling my 50c and going with something lower
No

I don't believe BMWs are V.  They are inline.  330 is a turbo 4, 340 is a turbo 6.  I had a 328 a few years back and didn't feel I needed a 335, but of course your driving may differ.  Basically the engines are very similar up to around 65-70 mph (of course the 6 is a bit faster in a straight line to 60, etc).  The difference is once you get past 65-70, how fast you accelerate. 

In my experience they are the best at handling unless you get something small (Audi TT) or even better small and mid-engine (Porsche Cayman, Boxster).

Yeah, its a pure gamble for me. No matter what I'm up pretty big (for me, I'm a micro-player lol) on this GME craziness so I figured I'd just take a shot in the dark and see what happens haha
You can add uncorrelated daily variances to get yearly variance, to get the yearly standard deviation you square root the whole thing and so to get the daily standard deviation you end up with the yearly variance divided by the square root of number of days

What kind of fucking .gov shit is this?
No, I wouldn't buy if it takes off on Tuesday unless you get lucky and get a limit order filled. Maybe watch pre-market and see if it moves much. If it rockets up, you missed it and buying at an insane price is just too risky.



I don't think that's going to happen, though. I think you'll have a chance to get it.

Both will lose 30% of their value in the first year... so yeah might as well use the margin

Soo, we should be worried...
Plenty of people did last week in the daily threads lol

The way I understand it conceptually, you don't expect price of option to move linearly with time (i.e., as dte gets closer does a 1 unit change in vol have the same effect on price as a 1 unit change in vol when dte is very large?). The mathematical relation is proportional to square root of time

Guys the market is currently going into a correction phase and rotating into value as we get more stimulus and inflation. This boosts yields and dividends and pe ratios of less than 40 are attractive.

It's pretty obvious that either this week or next week will finally be a catalyst for PLTR. Been lucky to buy in lots at these cycles between 22 and 30 last few months. Looking forward to leaving it after product day and some upcoming contracts I expect to come through soon after. Think the share unlocking is going to be a lot more ppl holding than selling if you ask me.

So with these vaccines and shit going out when do you guys think things actually go back to normal?
Lmao yes
Absolutely balls deep in VSTO. Between VSTO and GME I am out of cash lol
It's called a premonition.
If GameStop doesn’t sell any extra shares I could definitely see it hitting a ridiculous price per share. $100 would be too low at that point since the demand would be way too high

I was doing it manually because I think there's too much low effort content where people just take scenes from movies and superimpose random position information on it.

At least make jokes and shit. Have it be concise. People have started to make like 20 minute movies with "GME SHORTS" in terrible white fonts superimposed at 90pt size over the protagonist of their favorite movie.

What ever happened to Meghan Fox? Chick fell out of the spotlight real quick
Janet Yellen as a strong dollar advocate means markets will probably trade sideways with some ups for the next 6 motnhs, but then the fed will start signaling they're going to raise rates in 2022, so the markets will react to those mid 2021 signals and start correcting downards. 

That means we have a 6 month period to make hay before the market starts reacting to future interest rate hikes. I think that means buy mid-2021 leaps instead of Jan 2022 leaps, and make them no more than 20% OTM, and start derisking by selling off positions around May.
Well I’m hoping at least 51.5
how much is that in GME trade in credits?

There’s also the chance of a ratings upgrade. Moody’s and S&P have GME at B3 and B-, which is rated “highly speculative”. Ratings are reviewed every quarter, and a review might be due this month (i.e. this coming week or next). Good chance that the agencies might upgrade GME to a B2/B, or even better to the next higher band (Ba/BB).
They’re in the baby stage of a ton of several potential catalysts

you should listen to "this man". You are getting insider information, that should help you making up your mind. 

If you agree with him or not does not matter. You can still yolo into weekly calls to your hearts desire, but getting the opinion of someone that actually knows what they are selling, should be of interest to you.

As I said, you can still gamble to your hearts desire on the hype, but you should not "boo this man".

China is coming for us like a crazy little shitzu goes for your ankles and our fed knows now, more so than ever, we have to stay competitive against them and unless sleepy is really on some commie shit we aren’t seeing a crash or “recession” for a long time to come.

Shorts have collateral when they open a short position, as price goes up, collateral requirements goes up, if they can’t meet the new requirements, then their positions gets liquidated, meaning they would have to buy at the open market to close their short positions.

If you can make more by taking actions to push the stock price up than by way of actual wages, you should probably look for a better-paying job elsewhere. Remember that your wages are tax-deductible for the company, and stock prices tend to loosely follow P/E.

In this market trading sideways is a correction.

Do you know how many times since September retards like you said GME was at the top? Breaking news: this is not the top also... Unless you think 0.35 P/S is a fair valuation for a company with 1.3B in e-commerce sales in one quarter

Trust bro j yolo again it can’t go wrong 💯💯❗️🤠🤠✅🤪🤪🤪🤪😤🤯😨🤬🥵😠🥶
Thx btw. also do some research on how to use the spacebar. 🤡
In general high DXY corresponds to lower equity performance because they've become more expensive. But what if the rest of world economy is also in the shitter? Would that not push foreign countries to demand more USD and US equities to get some return?
Well, this is the first time I've subbed to a YouTube channel and actually hit the notification bell.

PLTR 4 Hour Chart Bull Flag Breakout Points. Support/Resistance

200MA has been serving as support
Cureent $25.33

Breakout above and can hold $27.34 for 4 hour chart. 27.34 would then become the new support.
After that we go to 33.50 or higher. 

Data valid only for the 19th. We want to see the range get tighter and tighter you retards.

Yes absolutely. Even boomers made huge returns in 2020. How the hell do you lose money unless you’re buying puts
Ok ok.
Did you buy it before or after Friday's 11% pop?
Yeah I mean, i don't like making fun of people because everyone starts somewhere, but getting excited about hitting $100 a YEAR in dividends is a little ridiculous.

Don’t lie
I only have 25 shares and wanted to buy 125 more on Tuesday morning. If daddy RC makes a huge announcement that basically guarantees the squeeze, and the price opens at like $200, would it still be worth it to go all in? If the price opens at $200, it's probably gonna end up at like $500+ by the end of the day, right? I'm fomo'ing hard and wanna get in as much as possible while I can
Well they are legalizing so they can collect taxes on sales and then use that $ to support the stimulus package

$400/share is a $28.5B market cap. If Ryan Cohen executes his vision even remotely correctly this will be fairy valued at $20B-$30B+ sometime in the next year or 2, whether the squeeze happens or not.

There are far more overvalued companies out there even at that share price, that’s for sure.
Has strong support at about 3080. I could see it drop to that but within the first hour go back over 3110

GMEs CEO is doing what I've been telling gamestop to do for years and years.  I should be CEO.  My plan is 4fold:

*1) online retail, using storefronts as shipping centers*

 *2) storefronts include a  "showroom".*

The showroom is a place to gamers to hear their headphones, see their monitor, or feel their mouse/ keyboard/ mousepads before shelling out $$$.  Right now gamers are forced to buy their equipment "blind" (PC and console alike!); there's certainly market for niche equipment that's not filled by Best Buy (they focus on broad consumer goods, not gamer goods).

Of course, there is still space for high-margin items like collectibles, and  stock of physical game disks, consoles, etc.  

*3)Community outreach:*

 Gamers go into gamestop just to stop in and browse.  Chat with people who've worked there and they all agree: they get people coming in every day just to chill.  These people chat with the employees who are always super friendly.   *Gamers want to go to gamestop!*

To capitalize on this the store space must become more inviting.  a) The showroom is part of this: it's flashy and pretty.  That's why Apple stores are such a hit.  The showroom should be prominently in view through the windows.  b) Temporary event space. A small (eg 8x8) space for: console tournaments; CCG games; VR; snacks. The simple visual cue of having 'lounge' space makes people feel more welcome as they browse. Right now the GameStop experience feels ... like a store.

Note on VR:  temp-to-permanent VR setup visible from the windows can draw customers in.  Not sure on insurance needs for this.

*4: weakness in small game stores.*  Game stores have been in dire straits for a number of years.  This is especially true for board and card games, whose community is mainly served by very small independent stores.  I don't think GME should get into board games -- they take a lot of space -- but CCGs like Pokemon and Magic take very little space, have decent margin and come with a built-in-community (they are always looking for a place to play!).   As smaller stores are pressured out this leaves space  for GME to grow.

These market holidays are killing me. Let’s go.
Hell yeah BB Gang!
Your profile reeks of 🌈
I tried working through the math and the dilemma is I can't get it to work. GME will need to issue additional shares over and above the existing shelf offering. 

From a direct comparison perspective, there has never been a squeeze with where the SI higher than market cap.  There has also never been a short squeeze where retail traders are proactively discussing exit positions pre-squeeze (note that It's becoming less and less of a discussion on if will happen and more and more about prices to exit). 

With a short squeeze, the ones that are willing to hold out the longest will obtain the highest prices - just track the volume and sell accordingly.  Liquidity will entirely dissappear and there will be intraday gap ups between each tick.  This will look like a reverse auction.  

I have gone through this ad nausea and I wouldn't be surprised if the SEC steps to fuck the retail investors.  That being said, the keg is primed and most people have positions locked in.  Decide for yourself at price you are comfortable selling at.
RH is one of the brokers you dont need to worry about yet
Yeah but chance of what? Is he referencing the squeeze? What does the nut mean?

So brand new autist here. I want to be a part of the meme and possibly history. 

I'm trading using Robinhood. I wanted to buy $5000 worth of GME stock. I also signed up for gold. It takes a few days for Robinhood to get the withdrawal from my account. They did give me instant buying power and I queued the request to purchase GME stock. All this is pending until the next business day.

I see a lot of mentions about not buying stock on the margin. I understand that there is a such thing as a margin account and read up a bit on how it works in general. 

Technically Robinhood is letting me borrow $5000 until the transaction clears. Do these warnings about buying this stock on the margin apply to me?

If not, are there any concerns with my approach in general while these transactions are queued?

 This is it. We’re fucked. 2021 Biden bear market. Fuck
So is DeepFuckingValue exercising those contracts and holding shares to drive the stock price up further or what? I'm curious, any idea how much of a dent that would make? Seeing as that is forcing someone to actually purchase the shares, wouldn't that squeeze it even harder? I don't know much about much, but that's how I think it works. Correct me if I'm wrong

Now I’m torn.    GME all in!!???  Or leave some love for the BB tard gang.    But whaaaaaa would a true WSB Rocketeer do?
I'm putting 5k on Tuesday, thanks for the tip 🚀

Nah.
Everyone knows you don’t go full retard
We shall see
if you are in this sub, more realistically, you would initiate the transfer and then realize it take a few business days to transfer to your account. after 30 min, mr beast would say you lost but give you like 5k for being autistic
The person below me said he’ll do it
Feel real real dumb selling it for like $40 a share back in 2019

I remember when I was unbanned, it was during the great unbanning during that whole WSBgod/mod scandal
Can't argue with that.
This is the field I have spent the last ten years of my career, and I feel obligated to point out that there are several inaccuracies in this DD. 

1st: Blackberry is NOT the industry leader for in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) systems. Not even close. They certainly don't have "lock and key" over this market. Other notable competitors are Panasonic, Visteon, Harman (who has access to Samsung's pocketbooks now), Microsoft, among others.

2nd: QNX is quite honestly getting phased out of the market. It was very popular as an IVI operating system for many years, but for the past 5 years, every OEM has been ditching it for automotive grade Android (which, despite the similar name, is in fact a full-blown OS, not to be confused with the Apple Carplay competitor Android Auto). QNX is starting to be relegated to the budget level IVI systems, while Android is shipped on premium units. Over time I expect automotive grade Android to continue to take market share from QNX.

3rd: Apple Car play is absolutely NOT built on QNX... Honestly that prospect is comical.
This post honestly helped me understand what didn’t sit right about the post regarding buying only shares and not calls. Seemed like purposefully overwhelming information then calling it complicated then providing a simple solution. It’s something I’m more used to seeing in debates.

If you wanted to maximize a long position you could have a long stock position, with a covered call, and use the premium to buy otm calls.

You could have a synthetic long position by selling a put and buying a call. And cap potential losses by buying an otm put. 

But somehow going only long stock seemed like the least effective way forward given our unprecedented access to derivatives. 

Another post suggested allowing brokers to lend shares from client accounts which is probably he single most undermining thing to a short squeeze.

I mean I'm going to buy more now too
I’d rather die than buy a bond
It does, however, motivate me to work harder. And I do actually have a lot of ability to impact the success of the company. So now working overtime or doing long, stressful technical support work feels worth it.

I could not get another raise for several years and I’d still feel pleased with my wage. There’s not really a lot of motivation there. But if I can secure sales I could make myself more money in stock than I make in my wage.

Its possible that GME could capitalize on their brick and mortar presence to make PC gaming appealing to existing casual/family customers with component sales and demos. 

At that point they've made a sale to someone who probably never thought about going into Microcenter or Best Buy.

Happy I don’t have work tomorrow but sad the markets closed
BB is a leader in cyber security and the new stimulus is giving cyber security $9 Billion in funding, BB also is involved in the EV sector with Dec partnership with Amazon and just recently Sony for their EV sector. GME will drop like a sac of potatoes the minute the announce another shut down, with the Biden Admin another shut down is likely they are working on an online platform but nothing has been delivered like their rival company “Steam” and not to mention they should of had a desktop program years ago. When it comes to them competing with Steam they simply can’t, a company involved in digital gaming since 2009. GME only exist because they speak game, but when they go head to head with digital services what do they offer against steam? The gaming retail market has so many competitors and yea of course sells will be up, we just had two new console releases and stimulus checks go out this year not to mention bonus unemployment money.

I'm confused. Do you want to build a barbell portfolio using options? Because it sounds like the way you are talking with options is that you would just run OTM sets and those are dirt cheap but they are run as "expenses" in these scenarios. In other words you buy them with the expectation to lose money on them. Now if you're clever you'll use a credit spread to get someone else to buy it but other than that you do it to lose, not to win.

It's generally a bad idea to invest in your employer for exactly that reason. Investing in sectors that would do well if your industry falls off a cliff is a good way to hedge against changes in your industry's economics.

As an example, Apple's employees love stock grants, but ex-Enron employees aren't too keen on them.
But... we’re all retarded here
I don't know what's worse, the fact that those exist, or the fact that people actually sign a contract with it. I mean, this is no Mensa convention, but damn... I'd think people here would be too smart to do that.

Only one who’s getting gaped on Tuesday is your mom. She scheduled an hour sesh for 2:30
Margot Robbie she could educate me on the stock market all day in that bathtub.
Fellow newbie here, I also have 3 shares but probably dropping another $200 into the game Tuesday, after being motivated by professional retards like OP. My plan is to sell 30% once I'm at 200% gain, around $100, to secure zero loss. And then I'm riding the rest of the shares to Valhalla 🚀🚀 until I think it's peaking. And after all the bumpy ride up and down I'm putting 40% of the profits into the long game once price drops back.

Why not some call option for a few months out?

Are you as dumb as you sound.   In 2019 he promised 1 million robo-taxis.   Have you seen one yet?   I haven't.   Have you recently read about the recall on Model S because of fucked up software.    You are in serious denial.   And it's not a software company.   It's a car company with software with a shit ton of competition coming for them.   It's lights out.   You're gonna lose your ass   I can promise you that.

Youre telling me you dont want a lambo for 50$ a month??!?!
I’m with you at 9k

You think this is bad. It's good. Sooner or later you need to develop the will and mental ability to cope with this kind of theoretical loss.

I "lost" $5M by quitting my job at TSLA at the end of 2019 and giving up my stock. Yeah. Fucking retarded.

I "lost" $1M by only putting $100 into those GME calls that went up literally 100x instead of like $10k. Same story for the $800 TSLA calls I somehow bought for 0.51c/per a couple months back.

Sooner or later it'll happen. IMO it's a valuable character building experience. You either mope yourself to death or figure out a way to quit being a bitch and live a happy productive life without getting lost in "what ifs."

But what do I know I'm just some retard.

I hope so too.... so does 213907534 others.
I've been investing in this company ever since John Chen took over. Look up his history with Sybase. Took the company over when it was a $6 stock. Sold it down the line for $60. Patience is key here. He's got an incentive with BlackBerry here too. If the stock hits $30/share, he takes home a $90 million dollar bonus. I've been laughed at for owning this for years, but I've been slowly accumulating and now people are beginning to ask me about BlackBerry.

I sure fucking hope so

It’s a secret for a reason.
No stop loss, it's a meme that Melvin short raids and trys to trigger them. If everyone bought 20k this would legit moon.
This was also somewhat lucky since Thursday after hours boosted BB by $2 almost which was equivalent to the entire 20\~% move of Thursday and $11.56 was the high and luckily he sold at open otherwise these would have lost profits fast.
You should edit your post with a crowd funding link. People would probably help you buy in.

People give /r dividends a lot of shit, but my high dividend stocks have grown a shit ton since August (20-30%) and are paying between 5-10% dividends right now.

Value stocks are good investments right now. They aren't always. But getting in now or 6 months ago was the fucking right play.

Sure some of the tech stocks mooned, but I'll take leaps in a stock I know with 100% certainty will go up 30% over the next year as the economy recovers over something like TSLA which may go up another 200% or may drop by half, who fucking knows.

Once the euphoria dims, I'll be transferring more of my money into growth or div etfs.

And the dream is to get to a point where I make 80k a year in dividends. Which I will achieve before I retire.
Just the DD I was looking for....

Margot. I don’t vibe with Israel 🥸
Apologies, I must have misinterpreted your comment.
I'm fascinated by the $1000+ MOASS PT. It is to me both absurd and believable, believe it or not. Given the circumstances were in. I too don't see any other event in financial history where this setup is to be found. 

I personally set a potential price target of $550+ (+-$200 to account for market randomness), which I posted about in detail days ago. This means this $1000+ PT is the highest I've seen so far, and mine comes second. 

Even at $500, I find it hard to believe, though it is mathematically sound and possible, again, given the circumstances.
Importantly, emotion can cloud reason, especially at this level of hype. 
So I tried to post a mathematical proof of the potential for $500+.

All in all, I wouldn't discount $1000+. As crazy as it seems, I think it's possible. 
Kudos to OP to set forth a PT as beautiful as that.

In the "neutral but actually bad" section, you mentioned that it's unlikely shorts will be replaced. Could you explain why that's unlikely? I'm still trying to understand how shorts work. Someone in another thread said a friend of theirs works in risk management at JPM, and he said that the shorters will most likely double down, hope that the SEC doesn't get involved, and wait it out. Even if the price goes to $400+, the shorters can still get out of it by waiting for the hype to die down. Does that confirm your theory about the shorts not being replaced? I really don't understand this stuff, just trying to see if there's a connection there
Thank you for the direction. That is not how the strategy works at all (black swans can be positive or negative), but I will re-post in that forum.
F S who?
Godspeed. FWIW I think the initial period of freaking out over gaining/losing money is necessary. You need to become desensitized to thinking about it in terms of real-world value to become a true autist. Otherwise as you found out it is too stressful.

And also remember that a lot of the people making these YOLO plays with $5k-$20k at a time have 6-figure salaries and up. I make just under $300k w/ bonus + stock. It still sucks balls to lose $10k. It sucks a lot. But it isn't life ruining. In fact it has no impact on my present-day life outside of the mental anguish of knowing about it. 

Remember that when you retards working at Wendy's are following the plays of people who can lose 5-figures and not sweat it.

nvidia rtx 3060ti,3070, 3080, and 3090 are all graphics cards that surpass the other generation's by miles, but for a significantly lower price. They're sold out everywhere. Think of it like apple releasing the 11 a year after the X, but if there were actual internal hardware upgrades.
🤢
I'm guessing because other markets will be open Monday.
Lol you are right, I live in europe and I got my date mixed up
to chapert 7. short interest position: 

 **"The 31Dec2020 short interest position was 67.98 million shares, so in 2021 the short positions have grown by 11.54 million shares and there was no actual covering last week. "**

Just because the short interest increased, it does not mean there was not any covering. They could have covered old shorts and opened new shorts at the same time. This would leave them with new shorts having a higher share price = less losses when covered.

They do break it down by segment and their software division does have "up and to the right" trajectory if you add back the drop in QNX revenue due to covid (that revenue will come back and have additional growth as auto production resumes at its pre-covid pace).

This most recent quarter was missed largely due to a difference in patent licensing revenues between Q2 and Q3, which should be ignored because patent licensing isn't the future of this business.
same, but I've definitely gotten fucked.

also, i can’t track down any of my personal belongings that were in the car when they took it, and nobody there has any clue what’s going on. i showed up at the damage recovery unit with the keys hoping i wouldn’t get arrested [(it’s a thing)](https://www.carscoops.com/2020/07/hertz-sued-for-allegedly-having-customers-arrested-and-jailed-over-stolen-cars/) and the guy in charge told me to go outside and find the car on the lot somewhere. then he came out to help me look for it.then he checked the computer and found out it had already been rented to someone else.

Should I download that RH app and take out a loan, or should I not jump into something I don’t know about and do research to become an autist first?

Short squeeze not going to happen with BB, it’s not GME. Relatively small percentage of BB float is shorted.

If it moons, it will do so on baking future growth from turnaround story into stock, as well as fundamentals (yes, a dirty word in this ZIRP-fueled green dildo beast of a market, I know)
As someone who’s gone seriously into 40K as a hobby, and followed them at arms-length financially as well, I think that was under the previous CEO. They’ve had a big sea change as well since about 2015 or so, and the stock has been a multibagger on the UK exchange with them getting back in touch with their fans.

They are doing a lot better towards independents now, and my local game store is actually owned and operated by an Ex-GameStop manager. He does the same used video game and console resale, and a substantial business in Games Workshop hobby stuff, also D&D, X-Wing etc. He has tables for free to play, snacks, hosts tournaments etc.

There’s a lot of crossover synergy in the demographic. If Lego or Disney don’t get in bed with Games Workshop, I suppose GME could.
Buddy we don’t make money here
Video book-bag?
SA P2 and UK P3 are rumored to be released within the next week and a half. From there, probably 1-2 months for EU and FDA approval. 

Approval is essentially guaranteed, even if the P3 results are bad. Based on how long P3 has taken, that scenario seems unlikely. 

Hard to predict the stock movement. If we hit 90%+, the stock could see a 50-100% bump. If the results are bad, I think we see a short term drop, but should recover once they get their approval.
Great!
Are clean energy stonks small caps? If so I might not be super fucked

"If you incur 1 free riding violation in a 12-month period in a cash account, your brokerage firm will restrict your account. This means you will only be able to buy securities if you have sufficient settled cash in the account prior to placing a trade. This restriction will be effective for 90 calendar days.

As these examples illustrate, it's easy to encounter problems if you are an active trader and don't fully understand cash account trading rules. It is important to maintain sufficient settled funds to pay for purchases in full by settlement date to help you avoid cash account restrictions."

Q - say there is a short squeeze.  Price goes up violently.  Share holders head for the doors to collect their tendies...but what if there are no buyers to complete the other side of that transaction...if we don't have a buyer to sell to?  Theoretically, the shorts have to cover at the price the stock is at but what if they can't?

Futures don't mean shit right now, especially only at .17%. it will be like it usually is, green at the beginning of the week and red by Friday. Besides GME of course 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Guys, after we get through our GME phase, can we consider revitalizing TANKER GANG
Agreed.  He wants stable growth and has no interest in a SSqueeze or P'n'D.  Super volatility makes you look like a penny stock and damages credibility.

Ok, yes a net increase to a stable $50 could help secure finance as needed.  But other than the historical amusement factor, short term $500 share prices for a $50 company is unhelpful.  It blots the charts and the crayon-drawers won't know where to color in anymore.

The word in non-retail will be "oh, GameStop.  That was a retail PnD"... Not the message you really want lurking around for the next 2 years.

But on the flip side... Letting the shorts chew a dick?  Screw the same people who are telling the market that the business is not recoverable?  Yeah, I could see a situation where the board would be happy for the scummiest shorts to get their grubby fingers burned.  Why?  Because it amplifies the message that when he was not on board, it was worth shorting, but now that the The Chewy Daddy is on board, you had better stop shorting.

"It's not about money… its about sending a message".

So yeah, the short squeeze is not strategically helpful to the board, but tactically, the shorts getting burned is good for the board.

You could say that the board and WSB's interests are currently aligned in burning the shorts.  That depends on whether WSB's goal is immediate term gains, long term value or taking a pop at the shorts as a sign of activism.  I suspect it is not one single reason since, we know, WSB is a spectrum.

Seriously? Remove this shit. You are no more a retard.   
You'll force SEC to either ban WSB or kick Cohen with this kind of shit.
Wow someone legit downvoting every single comment
twitter just pissed off half their audience lol.  It keeps banning the people that brings in their traffic.

Wait till countries like India call to start their own twitter/social media platforms because they don't want a hippie named jack controlling their elections.

Also, the company is run by an idiot that can't see social media trends.  Twitter missed the image sharing boat, missed the direct messages boat, missed the video reels boat.  They are still stuck in sending short texts world thinking people still use twitter via text messages.  At least Zuckerberg knows when to buy or steal from his competitor.  

Their next quarter is going to be brutal.  I would wait until their next earnings report to buy.  Twitter will most like fall to $30
DIS is the way
Shit, I gotta get more money for some ERIC calls.
Good plan, dont let shorts win

Fuck yeah bro - if you're in an area for it and got the mind to do it; consider a 2 family.

That extra income can be huge. Then you can move into a single family in 2-5 years and rent out both units in the 2 family.

If you pay cash for it, that 2 family cashflow + salary income should pay down a single family house mortgage pretty quick.

I hesitated posting about PBI — I’m taking another gamble this time. Last time in August I made about $35K off of PBI with calls (wish I waited to sell them 1-2 weeks after earning) but this time I’m rolling the dice again. 3800 shares and 60+ $8 calls. Fuck it!
So why are futures open? We get a whole day of nothing but futures trading?

I have a dream, a dream that all bears will be fuk come Tuesday.
There are alot of retards on here, but you are by far the retardest.
I like to imagine this is how the stonks ended up where they are at right now. Let’s start at the beginning of 2019.

Early 2019: Feds start cutting interest rates after hawkish tone, investors begin to look towards equities and alone where along the line started fucking with dealers gamma to push stonks up. Everyone starts going ham on the stock buyouts.

Mid 2019: Trump Twitter “Where TF are the negative rates at JPOW??” and “I hereby order all US business to cease doing business in GYNA”. Markets flip shit. Fed gets involved because banks won’t loan moneys to retard companies. JPM literally making money betting on the fed to start intervening as lender of last resort. 

September 2019 WSB: Hey guys! Let’s buy all the calls so MM’s have to buy stocks and maybe we can cause the market to short squeeze Hurr Durr. Don’t fight the fed/printer go brrrrr. 

Sept 2019 MM’s: Wow, these guys are truly retarded. Let’s play along fo fun. 

Feb - March 2020: Holy fuck the end is Neigh! Fed drops interest rates to 0%, massive selloff begins causing insane feedback loop of selling. Bulls are in disarray. Fed intervenes. JPOW flexes the feds cock and says it’s loaded and ready to splurge. 

Also somewhere in 2020 SoftBank: Y’all hear of this retard forum called WallStBets? Let’s copy their trade strategies on big tech to juice our gains and maybe we can get retail to push momentum and create FOMO. 

Hedge funds: Yeah! Let’s do that and let’s also short the VIX cause it will drop make easy money. What could possibly go wrong at this point?
 
Few months of hurr durr derp durr and now we are here. WSB has become an echo chamber of retards trying to find penny stocks that could potentially short squeeze.
FUTURES ONLY MATTER IF YOU TRADE THEM

Is it not also an option to sell your longs and keep the shorts if you feel the stock has topped out? You lock in profits on your longs when it's starting to lose value and get to keep the premium on your shorts.

Needs more tendies
Great DD. Baba is comically undervalued right now. All of the news about Jack Ma is just scare tactic type of stuff. There’s no way the CCP is going to do something to sink BABA. They want outside investment and know if they seriously fuck that business the global investment community will become much less likely to put money into their market. I mean wasn’t it funny that they only fined Tencent and BABA something like $75k back in December. When I read it I thought it was a joke.

A guy over in fatfire with $5mm net worth wonders if he should retire at 30 from a job he hates.

Yeah it just sucks though, I should have waited until Friday to buy but after it slid for a week it was looking OK but I guess should have paid more attention to the 14 day RSI/MACD and not bet on Biden speech pushing it up.

Also the Tesla inverter nonsense smashing SEDG didn't help, it was down 15% on Friday.

Wtf?
Doubt it
Good point, slightly different version: shorts are nuts not to cover now.  Alternatively shorts are nuts thinking there is chance for the price to drop (so they can get out) as per the dumb & dumber meme.

:)

I'm so bullish (hard) now that I'll buy for another 50k Tuesday morning. Looks like once per lifetime opportunity to break the chains of corporate world. Worst it can get it drop to 18 so I'll lose 25k, but if it squeezes... It's too good opportunity to pass. High risk, high reward mates.

PS. Showing middle finger to all the manipulative boomer media has intrinsic value of its own. Seems like time when they spoon-fed shit to population is coming to an end. What a time to be alive.

I think it's one of two things.  Either: 

1) He is referencing General Patton during WWII.  When the Nazis had Bastogne surrounded during the battle of the bulge they asked for the surrender of the 101st airborne holding the French village of Bastogne.  In response, General Patton declared: "NUTS". Essentially telling the Germans to go fuck themselves.  So We would be the 101st airborne in Bastogne, While the shorts are the Nazis.  Go fuck yourself Melvin! we ain't budging!  and the gif is Nazi Melvin thinking "there's a chance" we will surrender.  

or

2) He is calling us retarded nuts.
Because the bookings (eg contracts) they’ve won in the last few years are too much to be affected by anything < $2b contract awards. This tells us they are amazing at proposals and out of the box thinking, but the execution is what drives sales and free flow cash in defense. With a record backlog, now is the time to start executing
At least China is buying cuz we are obviously a bunch of pussy sellers
The only way it’ll go to $100 is if TSLA starts using QNX.  Other than that expect a $20 - $30 upside in next 1-2 years
imagine going “lol oops” at $50m

it is though, im literally trading right now.
So if market hits limit down or up, you think traders will just sit there saying haha, futures don't  matter or do you think perhaps there will be a strong reaction once market opens?

It's better than the gang bang
THIS is why TSLA is dead.   If you think I'm wrong, just wait.   And all of you pumpers that are rooting for NIO at the same time you're long TSLA, you're slowly killing off the golden goose.   Lights out... just a matter of time.

It's obviously a private enterprise within itself but there is no doubt that the entire "brand" as a whole doesn't have an impact on the perceived value of Tesla. As investing has become more democratized, with financial apps and fractional shares, etc.,  you're going to see more and more people stashing their money based on those perceptions of brands and not disciplined speculation based on their interpretation of the data available.

What about actual market indicators instead of economic indicators? Greed/euphoria at unprecedented levels, investors maxed out/all in with no additional free powder to keep buying, stocks at overbought RSI levels that have never been recorded, ridiculous P/E valuations on non profitable sectors. If you were a large institution with the ability to move markets, what better time would there be for a rug pull, take profits and just buy back after a 15% correction while retail scrambled to double down with any reserve funds/leverage they can. Call me a GB, whatever. I'm taking advantage of the bull run now like everyone else, but if there is any time to exercise caution while making trades it's this quarter
Aren't futures technically up like .6% since the AH on Friday? Fucking annoying how it shows it down. Now people are more inclined to buy on a "dip" that doesn't exist
>implying I’ve ever left my mothers basement
Nobody ever sells at the top or buys at the bottom and nobody here cares if you live or die, so you gotta do you, boo. That being said, if you sell your shares on the first dip, a rep from this sub will fuck your wife.

Bull r so fuk
I think we may see a "quiet" 2day, with "only" +20-30%. And then 1000% in next day. Sooo, 420.69$ actually might happen.
I thought it’s closed for Martin Luther King Jr holiday
$100 million shelf offer at Friday’s close ($35.50) would only dilute shares by 2.8 million which is around 4% of current total shares. It’s a possibility and it wouldn’t be ideal but it’s not a death sentence. If the price continues going up this week it would weaken the dilution further.
Icln down in New Zealand already. Contact and Meridian both down. Guess we’ll see how Hong Kong market does. I’m fucked

A lot of people drive hours to buy hardware from micro center. 

Why wouldn’t you buy from somewhere local? Are you too cool for GameStop?
yea I don’t think the rally was just a short squeeze for Tesla. But it’s undeniable that shorts did get squeezed on Tesla, however that’s not the reason for this insane run up. It was a mix of a lot of retail buying, call buying, the overall market going up, the constant Tesla
Catalysts, the biden win and blue wave, and the S&P funds having to buy TSLA
Haha right? There’s a fat dip right now for it so I am very tempted to cash in for it. Also looking at 25-30c for 1/2022.

I also don't get how gamestop would do this over say, best buy. They don't have the supply chain, the pull for manufacturers, the space and warehousing for it. And best buy has in house techs they could train/hire for pc building. And you're still.competing against the prebuilt manufacturers and places like microcenter for pricing. Best buy would also be able to upsell on accessories much better.
Yeah lol. I'm kidding I'm a bull

Do you really think 4-8 years of clean energy policy is priced in because it rallied a bit already? The last 10 days was just profit taking. We'll have a clear upwards trend over the next several years.
So glad there are other autists that appreciate TF2.
always
Profit taking from the run-up and Biden not saying clean energy enough in his stimulus address. Hopefully this pushes it back up, I'm down on TAN now due to bad timing. :/
Yup! Plus if it doesn’t MOASS it will just turn into a long squeeze. In that scenario price will steadily rise as shorts start covering their positions. And any good news during that period should cause small jumps in share price too! Either way it’s a no brainer for risk to reward potential.
It’s going up don’t listen to these bear fucks

I’d bet a thousand bucks big money reacts strongly to the unprecedented influx of traders/RI. Melvin would love to fucking wreck wsb portfolio.
youll even make your wife's boyfriend proud, dont worry.
There's practically no EV left to squeeze out of a call like that anyways. Use it to cover calls or exercise.
You sound scared.   Only someone with zero confidence in a position of a fraction of a share could be so nervous.    If you've made money.... sell.   Print this out and check back on 12/31/21.

My experience has been in Gov sector. What they are selling in our world is outrageously expensive, and is not unique in any way. As with any government contract heavy company, they don't really have to be particularly good too keep winning contract bids. It's all about being first to market, not the best.

I bought in during IPO @ $10.00 cost basis and plan to hold long. I may not particularly like PLTR, but I like making money. All it takes is another war and it's 🚀🚀🚀
At least they're used to it by now
Of course futures open even lower, it’s my fault for buying SPY calls
There are seriously autistic people who use statistics & probability on baseball to rob the average degenerate gambler.

Start the year off well when I used the $600 stimmy to make an extra $150. But this past week, gave back that and more. Now down to $120 total. Fuck me, man
I think GME end game is a buyout.  I think MSFT will buy them out..
I pulled all of my money out of the market years ago because of stress - yet for some reason I'm super tempted to get back in the game and gamble on this

Good.
I agree with thinking it’s over valued but I guess I think it’s more of a product of the renewable energy/ev bubble vs a short squeeze/ melt up but I could see your logic behind that conclusion
Bull is so completely FUK
Why are you here on a Sunday night then?
futures matter if it hit circuit breakers which won't happen today.

1. Where did you learn this stuff, was it school or YouTube or both.

2. Do you really believe this shita going to 1k a share?
This is the company ebay uses for their global Shipping program when someone outside the US purchase an item on ebay from the US. They ask the seller to ship it to the PBI mailing center who then dispatch it overseas. Sadly it's a really bad service

Case in point tho.

I get what you're saying, but the only real benefit I see to the way you did it is that someone can't just download the JS and set up their own site to serve a wsbsynth-esque experience.

Reddit doesn't give a shit if each user using the site fetches their own data. Why pay for something they'll happily pay for?

People don't care about voice quality IMO. Maybe I'm wrong, but I don't think they do. I liked it though. Probably the coolest WSB utility i've seen so far. I liked to use it from time to time.

If you made a better version do it fetching info via JS and find a way to pan different comments to different locations and dovetail them so you can get through more faster.
That just sounds nuts

And yes, GME is a gamble.

Have her invest in stable, positive growth stocks and ETFs first. If she gets the taste of blood in the water, that's on her at that point. Intentionally targeting short squeezes is probably going to get a little more popular, and there will always be a next big stock.

You can deposit up to £20k a year into a stocks and shares ISA and won't get taxed on the gains, no matter how high. In a normal invest account you'll be taxed on any gains over £12k per tax year. I'd move your stocks into an ISA.

Hell yeah
Setting a buy limit at $35, if they don't fill then I'll spend half if it's sub-$40 and more if it has the usual dip after lunch time. Main objective is to lock in my capital and wait. Don't wanna leave any cash back at the launchpad

Buy GME
This is a dangerous play, but one that I think has a good chance of success. The past few weeks run up is the result of a bit of a short squeeze. That’s squeeze seems to be losing steam. The stock is grossly overvalued. It had to come down, so I think this could work. Unfortunately I have gotten burned short in Tesla quite badly.
First weekend sports betting. I need to stop already lol
Should I buy GME now or wait for a dip?

Green Tuesday morning
>the only other person I've seen on WSB with actual time spent using Palantir products isn't completely sold either.

I'm not sold on what they are selling, i'm not, its expensive as hell, and its nothing special. I am only talking about Foundry right now, keep that in mind. But our machine learning, we are not doing it on Foundry, let me just say that.

Palantir is exceptionally good at selling something REALLY damn expensive thou. So on the long term buy / hold, I am sold. Right now I'm all in on GME, but Palantir is not going to go away, and the inroads they are making into the private sector, they essentially have a money printer sitting in their cellar.

&#x200B;

Would I as a bottom level IT manager even consider buying Foundry? No I would not. But I know that they are getting their foot in the door with every industry, and large companies, day by day. I know that of my network of IT nerds, Palantir is moving into major companies, all over the country (switzerland in this case)
r/latinas is wayyy better
Ya that is what convinced me. 
I realized this isn’t just a meme squeeze stock, it’s legitimately undervalued. Even if by some miracle it doesn’t squeeze, it’s not going to crash. If Ryan doesn’t make it blast off, I’ll just sell it in a year or two, no big deal.
Its a fucking sunday. How could you possibly be losing?
This is the way. Shorts cant beat all of us
Lockout is 3 days after
You should never, ever trade from a stressed position. Remove your emotion. GME seems like a good play to most of us, but it can still go tits up with next to no effort.
I'm just a retard here, but I'm guessing it's not on everyone's radar, or they haven't done enough research to decide whether it's within risk tolerance.  There are certainly big players already involved and I'm guessing its being watched more closely after last week.

No problem. I know this sub likes to be gung ho and that a lot of the content is tongue in cheek, but I am getting increasingly worried lately that people will get too caught up in the enthusiasm and end up making ill-informed decisions that could seriously hurt them.
In this case, the post you mentioned contained valuable information and far from being a hit piece was actually nuanced and neither bearish nor bullish.
I think we should be grateful that people are producing high quality content (like that post) and even more so when it challenges our own theses, as it ultimately helps us make better trades.

What makes GME different is that, there is not a single place you can go for 'game' related hobbies for all kinds of nerds. Not a single place. Cohen is trying to merge them all and make a kingdom out of it, the market was going strong already, but Covid made so many people turn into video game hobby, exponential growth market. People are finally taking it as a norm after 10 years, compare the mainstream view on Youtube/Twitch 10 years ago and now.
I would rather be water boarded then watch future for 48 hrs without being able to trade

You guys see project hazel from Razer? Its a smart mask. I want one.

Counts as an n95 respirator. Has built in mic and can change colors.  Waterproof. Active respirator. Comes with a special charging case lined with a UV light interior which kills bacteria and viruses as the mask charges. Looks amazing.


I want one. I dont care about the cost. Just a prototype now  but Im pumped
My bad bro. Had the idea of a Velcro wallet and needed to take some creative liberties for it to work
Easy solution, if it says sponsored, just ignore it
I do, but not becuase of a post short squeeze crash. Tesla wasn’t profitable when shorts were heavily in the stock, but now that they are profitable and doing a lot of stuff, shorts got squeezed. I think it’ll come back down because it’s very overvalued
I’m glued to the 1 minute chart for futures, I don’t care that we still got another 38 hours until open
Because WSB retards love to panic☺
I am just a lurker, but I like how it's possible to use "trigger words" without anyone jumping on you.

And those trigger words are used for fun. There is no hate speech or racism, "retard" as a insult between friends.

No, he posted a cryptic message with no meaning so that the sec can’t slap him when you guys go out and bid on the thinking it means something.
So I’ve been spending my free time developing my own trading (and algo trading) platform 

was just talking to my buddy and he says he doesn’t think it’s possible at all for me to out perform the market and I should just buy spy shares and go do something else. being a real downer, kinda like a dad that tells his kid to stop dreaming of becoming something dope. 

Kinda pissed me off not gonna lie, I feel like there’s always a million reasons why you can’t do something or why somethings ‘impossible’. Obviously it’s a tall mountain to climb (markets are difficult) but Isn’t the point trying to find the ways you can make it happen? wtf else are you gonna do with your life. fuck that bitch yo
Because all anyone talks about is gme pltr and bb holy shit. No one gives any valid advice other than investing in stocks that are already at their moons

Yall are hilarious
nasdaq
Almost just did this. Had to close my bank account that was connected because of fraudulent activity, stolen checks etc. Tried to make a deposit from old closed bank account. Had my buy lined up for Tuesday and everything. Until it dawned on me that money will never be showing up because I sent it from a closed account. 

I'm trying to figure out why they wouldn't just let you make the correction, and why people are talking jail time. Seems a little extreme if you correct the mistake especially on a site where account are saved for later deposits.

r/DeepRockGalactic and r/PoliticalCompassMemes would like a word
I'm in, but would like a more detailed description of their model than is available in their presentation. They say they will make about $1000 per car annually but I'm trying to see where that revenue is coming from. The customer is saving money on their electric savings by selling back to the grid, Nuvve is getting their cut but the other sources of revenue are not easily understandable. There are no detailed analyst day presentations or videos. Also, would like to know how much of a moat 15 patents really is. Chargepoint is also doing bi-direction V2G. Are they stepping on any of Nuvve's patents and will Nuvve have enough money to litigate infringements.
Futures mooning ☺️ plus future doesn’t matter

What does PLTR and GME have in common ?

Cohen's and 🚀's
I only ever lurk here and see the unironic pinnacle of meme content, comments, threads. Never change. There’s a reason why ‘artist’ sounds like ‘autist’ where I’m from
🌈🐻
I feel sorry for them. As a converted gay bear I understand stonks only go up. It’s so simple.

I mean, if the market decides to go sideways or even down I might dabble a little but there is only one way it seems 🚀
I’m tempted but it’s definitely a long-term play
Yes ok the ecommerce portion has potential and the share price is attractive. But this is a company that has been in massive decline for years and it sitting on large debt. 2020 may have been an outlier due to extra revenue due to covid. It has potential but is a 100 year old elephant that is only now starting to embrace tech.

So what you guys doing with the squeeze tendies if it plays out next week?
Facts!
Yeah I got some 25calls for 2022 back in June when they were like $0.18. I should have leveraged my house but I only grabbed a handful.
Right? It's not like we're talking about gamestop brand GPUs. They're just a reseller.
You can but there is no evidence that happened here. 
Also, if you read the post, you will see that the analysis is fair and nuanced and that the conclusion is neither bearish nor bullish. The TLDR set out right at the beginning is that "GME likely to be very volatile next week". The post notes that there are both "missing bear arguments" and "missing bull information". The conclusion at the end notes that new data "could change the picture to be more clearly bearish or bullish, not just volatile". 
Finally, the OP did not recommend that anyone buy puts. He simply stated that he had done so for the coming week and noted that he had done so last week too and exited at a loss (which he would presumably not mention if his intent was to encourage readers to follow his lead).

"made the right way" really depends on your end goal, though.

having it done server-sided offered two main advantages:

1. the quality of the voice itself was much higher than any client-rendering voice could offer ( at least that I am aware of ). it's why none of the sites similar to WSBSynth sounded anywhere near as good.
2. the voice is guaranteed to sound the same on all devices/platforms
3. not as relevant, but does guarantee to work with nearly all devices

The obvious trade off like you said is cost.

>client get content directly from reddit via js

only thing i disagree with it. either way you do it, I think pulling the content from reddit should always be done on the server. it essentially has no resource cost to have it done on the server-side and allows direct integrations with the analytic side of things.
Oh I see gotcha. Yep we're all retarded 🥜🥜🥜🥜🥜

There's lot of crazy ideas like this in that part of the world. Generally the oligarchs hire western companies to do the work, blow away a big chunk of their GDP (mostly taxes collected from western oil companies), and then reality sets in and the whole scheme just rots away like that statue from Ozymandias.

Will do! One last question senpai, for options what kind of expiry we talkin? Late jan, aug, dec?
I might, if there's enough of it, or they offer a better experience than Newegg. I actually prefer going to physical stores for it, the immediacy of getting started ASAP. When Frys went to shit I was forced to go online. However, provided I can buy components at store, I would. I wouldn't pay them to build one for me. I'd order online from them cause I fucking hate Amazon. If the experience can compete with Neweeg, yeah, I would. And AMD CPU is the same if I bought it at GameStop or Newegg. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Haha no I was at least half kidding but meant talking person to person or zoom or some shit.

Thanks for even considering it though. r/French or apps like hinative or Italky are gonna be my best bet but theyre probably gonna think its weird that I keep asking them how excited they are about Lucid Motors going public on a 1/10 scale. Also I was just kidding about the Frog business. Not that I imagine the French give a shit about that slur.

Performance Growth of Hypothetical $1000

1 Yr = 1000069
3 Yr = 100000069

The performance quoted represents past performance and does not guarantee future results.

CA has the worst vaccination % used among all the big states. CA is at 36% while FL, TX, and NY are all above 50% with TX leading the way at 60%. CA's approach is that a government-run vaccination program is more efficient than one that is run by the hospitals and industry.  Look at the results.  And yet people from CA (e.g., TWTR, FB, GOOG) think they should control discourse and policy in the U.S.

I’m not down for gambling peoples money; some family members are just now entering the stock market as an investment place to get their toes wet. They asked me what I have stock in and why, but I told them that I don’t want to give them advice because everyone should do their own DD to decide what they want to use their money in.  (I did tell them my positions and reasoning still)

Don’t buy on open when Tuesday arrives. It will probably dip a bit, so watch closely. Otherwise you’ll probably buy higher then what the dip will be an hour or two later. >.>

Wait an hour, throw some money into the stock and ride out the next couple/few months. 

It will be a wild ride, but if you’re nervous about blowing it all, just be careful of using options. Shares right now will still give you a lot of leverage. 

If you can afford $10k and ride without the capital for a few months, GME is not a bad play. There are just firms out there who want to make the stock sink (for their benefit), and that’s part of the ride we’re going up against right now. 

Just be careful with what you have.

Edit: I have a 100% smooth brain. Others may chime in for better ideas.
Bitch
Yes and that means it will shoot up and crash back down then have a steadier incline. This isn't going to be tesla where it shoots up to rediculous heights and stay there.

I definitely am feeling some cold feet but feel confident about upcoming earnings reports and think people undervalue tesla as just an EV company, not the larger picture as a complete alternative energy company as their mission statement claims. Sure, Apple and others are looking to build EVs. But where are their solar panels and house batteries and rocket ships?

yeah, thats a great advice. I might have gotten a little
too excited about all this, probably should reconsider the amount i was going to put in.. But thanks anyways,  i just keep getting surprised how much genuineness is found here besides all the madness :)
So is that idea that at point 'X' none of your limits trigger, but by the time the system checks the current share price at point 'Y' (this could be half a sec, 5 secs, 30, I have no clue how that works lol) maybe it has shot all the way past your second limit and sells for the higher price? Or do you have let's say, 10 shares at price 1, 50 at price 2, and the rest all at price 3?

Read it. its legit it took me 3 hours to collate the research.
Taking BB to 22$ and beyond. Don't miss out. The little pump last week was just the beginning. Once the main body of troops arrive from GME, it will be to late.
Yes. They collectively owned around 4% in a poll given around 1 month ago (I believe this sub has gained around 300k to 500k more retards since then). So 5% is the low end. A new poll was given out recently, but I don't know if it got to the front page even. The original poll was well done, with anyone who claimed to have more than 10k shares or something to provide proof to be verified.

I honestly know nothing about BB, my only focus for months has been GME. I can say I feel If you put $500 into GME I'm confident you'll make money if you buy and hold shares or calls that are like 6 months out.
Is there news?

Pltr systems are heavily used in s2 shops and replacing them would be extremely expensive and would take a lot of time to change systems and transfer over all data. A competitor would have to be a Fuck load cheaper, faster and easier to use. At the rate that pltr still doesn’t make a profit and the extreme barrier to entry it’s highly unlikely. The military still uses old af computers and some while I was in 3rd mlg hq unit still had windows xp. If pltr works youre not gonna get replaced. That’s how Raytheon and Boeing are still able to charge extreme rates for suppar work.

Best part about GME is that it will be a triple figure stock by end of year - without a squeeze! All that matters is you diamond hand that shit till it reaches 100+, or it squeezes, whichever comes first

A lot of people aren't taking this into account. MM's aren't really in the business of getting into pissing contests with internet retards. Just because they've got long dicks to swing around, doesn't mean they have any inclination to do so.

Yeah but being inside the MC you realize how old a lot of their systems are so once a program gets integrated the way a lot of s2 shops (small intel cells) have, I don’t it would be cost effective to switch. The problem is a company would have to come with something that’s better cost little to replace pltr with limited need for down time between system replacements. Overall it’s just such an pain if it’s broke why waste money on it when you can build more rockets. The military is very cheap when it comes to everything but air force
Hold. Should have more info on infrastructure spending from uncle Joe by then.
I don't like *a lot* of the ads they serve on our feed. I really wish we got more good attention from the admins. Why do only crypto subreddits get custom UI elements? Why do we have "99% win" pennystock spam ads? Why can't we say bad words if we mark ourselves for adults?

gme will squeeze. playing a short squeeze is really easy. once it goes vertical enough, and there is panic and blood in the streets, you sell. if you miss it, it halves, and you still sell with a ridiculous profit. 

holding on to a fud-ed stock - now that is hard!

upside on both is very good: baba should be 50% but fairly certain. 
gme could be anything from 50 to 5000% but it's very uncertain when and how it will evolve.

For one guy saying this is not a squeeze there is the entire market shorting 120% of it. One guy does not mean anything. This is a squeeze and everybody knows that. Man you just need to go outside to see Gamestops closing down on a daily basis. I do understand that they might be mooving to online but do we really believe that the online players will give up their spots like they do not care? If you want to buy online games there is the PS and Xbox shops, for PC games you have Steam and other there speciallized shops and so on. I am not saying Gamestop will go bust, I am just saying to not buy in this like it will be a revolution. Tell me, since I have no way to access the data, what is the forward price on the stock in 2 years? I can bet it is not even close to your target of 200+ if I remember correctly.

How do I invest in disruptive farming? 👩‍🌾
There’s usually an “Time in Force” option when setting the sell limit. Sometimes it’s hidden in mobile apps, have to click advanced / more trade selections.

You should read the account material your brokerage has available, should be some material for new investors to learn the trading software and terminology.  At the end of the day you are accountable for decisions on your investment accounts, not strangers on the internet, so you should really learn this shit before you lose a lot of money over a silly mistake such as selecting the wrong trade option.

So in order to not to be a dick... here’s some common definitions, but definitely check your brokerages specific definitions.

• Day: Expires at market close of the current day. Allows partial fulfillment. 

• Good til canceled: Active until investor manually cancels it

• Fill or kill: Request to fill order immediately, and it’s entirety (no partial fulfillment). If the entire order cannot be filled, the sell is canceled. Does not require manual cancellation.

• Immediate or cancel: Request to sell immediately, allows partial fulfillment. Does not require manual cancellation

Same. That’s roughly 28% gain in a week. I’ll take that every fucking day. If this gets a big catalyst this thing could double again
Mlk would buy the dip
yeah but how many shares can i get tho
Dad nab it I bought GME in November and paper handed in Dec. I was gonna stay out but after reading all this I gotta buy some John dang shares
Does anybody know the real VIX futures or are they cancelled now, ahead of the correction, so that we don't have to think about it

That's their old business model - look at the ecommerce portion that they're pushing for. If you're looking at vertical M&A a 100 year brand with already established distribution/fulfillment it doesn't sound like a bad choice. Even at a 100% share premium $15/a share is a pretty cheap merger for a bigger name if it fits as a strategic takeover. Completely agree that the old model is outdated but that's not the catalyst here. You're playing the e-commerce surge that we've seen over the last decade (which isn't going away) and a potential buyout target. Next earnings call will be huge to see if the playbook can actually have legs or if they are still a dinosaur bleeding cash.
There's a Boondocks episode about that. If you don't mind social and political satire. It's from a time before canceling was a thing.

What website do you visit to see the short interest of a stock?
🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈
Been browsing you autists for about 3 days now and I regret it. With that being said, you all make me want to buy $BB, $GME, and $PLTR. I own $TSLA for the long term. I think out of the 3 companies, PLTR has my interest because of their business plan and what they actually provide. I'm just wondering if I should buy shares, calls for short term(APR), or calls for LEAPS. Opinions?  


Oh, am I supposed to add this?  🚀 🚀 🚀  💦💦💦

Imma be honest I read people talking about IV and idk what that means someone explain

About as long as my penis. It was super short.

Ain’t no bluff things are going in the pooper
Nah I’m a gambler. Not a investor ( even though I don’t feel like I’m gambling with Gme, Ryan Cohen gives me that warm and fuzzy feeling)

I’m bullish on GME but I’d take 50 anyday

Holy big red dildo LMAO
Thats also an option. Shares cant go negative and you own that shit.
I did this last year. I'd rather watch grass grow. Oh, +$5 today? Wow. 

March -> December SPY500 shares: $10k -> $18k

Jan 1st -> Today, tech calls: $18k -> $62k

It's the autist way or the food bank.
I do most of my research there.
i had bought in at around 190, sold off at 310 and then bought back in when it hit 270, then bought more when it hit 260, and again more when it hit 250. and then it dropped to 215 and i went balls to the wall.

In typical wsb fashion the top comment has nothing to do with anything
Nah dumped tesla for GME friday I'm trying to eat tendies out of my KFC console, not wait for the correction to take my gains away.

No one knows. If it hasn't mooned, buy more. I'm setting a $35 buy limit for open and if it doesn't execute then I'll watch throughout the day. Aiming for sub-$40.
Your username? I never thought I'd see that name again.

In their demo, they will undoubtedly try to highlight the common shared mapping ability, that allows users from across organizations track the same information and collaborate effortlessly. But that part of gotham isn't really used by the real consumers. We don't give a shit about that.

Maybe they'll show how link analysis can be done. It'll look flashy as they seemingly make sense of a crazy clusterfuck of relationships with lines connecting everything.  No lie, this one is actually a good app within the platform, but it's not unique to Palantir.

Not sure how much more I can say. I typically wouldn't talk about a company that we do business with, but they fucked up and went public. Investors have a right to know these things from the actual consumers.

Sir we are too stupid for you, please, harvard advnaced maths school cannot comprehend this
Fact is my Reddit profile is less than 1% of my life, but I agree.. Assuming that would indeed be ignorant. Great observation. 


An old professor once said to me for assuming I knew something - “When you assume all you do is make an ass out of u and me.” 

The simple fact is the more money that you have, the more money you can make. I don’t consider 99% of the things I read people say online as fact. Like I said, I don’t need Reddit for validation. I already see first hand, daily, people in my life that are already doing what YOU consider impossible without posting their gains on WSB for validation. Lol.

I need to write up the DD but what you just said is what everyone thinks. But it’s not true (about them having to have self driving to become profitable). You don’t have to believe me but the evidence is out their and the Q3 earnings this year are going to fuck up a lot of outstanding shorts. 

I also work in the self driving space (not for Tesla) and the promise of completely unassisted self driving in cities where Uber/lyft make 99% of their money is way over hyped. That last 2 to 3% you need to solve to just say fuck it get in the car and let me sleep is going to take 5 years and some major technology advances.

Tey will be hemmoraging cash until they have self driving cars. If they eliminate the labor they win. But I think Tesla will get there faster, and their r&d will be wasted because they will just license from Tesla or buy Tesla ubers. It is a good hedge bet though, but is a very long term hold.
Great write-up. I too wonder how much short interest is actually out there. It feels like Wednesday's gamma flash should've eradicated all dealer short interest, and forced a bunch of other institutions to reduce size of position under standard internal risk management practices. I'm very skeptical, especially with IBKR share availability rising.
The futures market isn't the NYSE you fucking moron

No it’s called a team swap
Guys if you are smart or lucky enough to understand when to take your profit good for you but a lot of you guys will be hurt badly buying on the top. This is a short squeeze, the value is artificially high and soon or later it will collapse. Furthermore this is a short squeeze in a crazy market bouble (we all have to say big thanks to the fed, once it stops giving away money like it's christmas the all castle will collapse). If you are already in then good for you but if you are not then stay away as I am doing (I have no position). 
Btw the talks about put not rolling does not makes sence, with the squeeze vol and repo rates are high as Snoop D O double G thus making short option prize high as well.
Just saying... Hope for you it goes to the moon but remember that even Apollo XI has to come back once it arrived there
No retards rioting and we go to the 🌝🌝🌝
Don´t long, take shares to squeeze the shorts
Fuck fb but holy fuck that’s low dude. Best of luck with that

The rule of this market is to price in everything good that could possibly happen to a company for the next 5 years. By this standard, blackberry is a $50 stock. If you value them according to just their software division and the growth in that division since 2017 (just before they acquired cylance) this is a $20 stock right now using normal standards, not batshit insane 2020 valuation methods.

I think our curve here is going to look really similar to MGNI. I have calls for June, September and January of 2023 just in case.

Hey David Faber is Alexey Navalny ok too?
Well, local virgin, diamond hand that GME shit and you'll be rich too!
Slight bear here. I don't think share offering tanks the price, they can shelf offer 100m and take bankruptcy off the table with little dilution. They rationally should do so now, and Cohen can't stop Sherman from doing so. The company is not going to be obsessed with crushing shorts, it's going to be obsessed with surviving and growing, and that increases the probability of that outcome.

Check my comment history. But to sum it up:
It's not an AI/automated platform people think it is. It's a data scrapper and visualization tool. Like a google earth with a good boolean search function to sort through various types of reports.

It makes cool graphics like heatmaps, but that's just to make your PowerPoints look more impressive.

The software takes a massive amount of resources, that our government computers simply cannot handle.

Full disclosure: my rather large agency did not renew it's Palantir contract for the next fiscal year. My log in will become defunct, and we're switching to something web-based (not .js file-based) because cloud shit is the bee's knees on weak gov computers.

Long term I am not optomistic about them. Their business model relies on large postage machines in offices to print postage. This has been moving to other online competitors like stamps.com for 10+ yrs. Also noone is in the office atm to print postage, but customers are tied to leases which once expire they will not renew. They are very similar to copier companies.

Yeah it's not going bankrupt anytime soon, but I think streaming fatigue could be setting in. I find myself using the free services more now than ever. Or I just wait until the show is available on the network app a week later and then watch.

And a true consumer recession could really upend alot of streaming service like sling, hulu and fubo because unlike 2009 where people held on to tv, this time around even boomers don't care anymore. My grandparents cancelled their linear tv a few years ago and only now watch because they are on a family netflix plan. One of my aunt's was resistant to cord cutting a few years back but I helped her set up a directvnow (defunct now) package and now they don't even have a provider or a sub. It's just whatever is on the antenna and YouTube. And they're well off too.

Well in a way that basically is how a short squeeze starts. Regardless of whether they are buying shares to hold or buying shares to cover, they are doing so to minimize their potential losses. Buying shares drives the price up, which leads to shorts panicking or essentially being forced (if on margin) to close their position by buying more shares which drives the price up even more. Now they could try to do this in small increments to avoid driving the price up, but when there is high short interest and low float it could take several days to cover which gives the stock time to increase in price even more, and obviously increases demand for the stock.

at this point everything is automated, just make the stonk market trade 24/7 with ur shitty algos mm and gei bear short sellers. this is not a job, it’s a fucking lifestyle to trade FDs and do DD. we don’t need futures cuz we don’t have one.

I also think that there are a lot of lurkers around here. If you use the internet 90/9/1 rule only 10% of this sub are buying shares.

Another thing noone talks about: the logic many users here use is that with every share a WSB autist buys there are less shares in the hands of non-WSB shareholders which means the percentage of WSB owned shares increases. I personally think we have a lot of paperhand bitches here so a sell from one WSB autist to another is definitely possible and the percentage of WSB owned stocks would remain the same.
It hasn’t updated yet, it doesn’t activate until tomorrow
It would be if we got rid of the “retard” and other derogatory words that are commonly used. I am still super appreciative of this community and it has done a lot of us good!

Best part abt GME is it's a triple value stock by end of year without a fucking squeeze! Even if the squeeze doesn't happen next week (kind of 50-50 on this), HOLD that shit and be impaled by Ryan's glorious peanut genitals!
It’s never too late!! Buying more too

so I did a stupid.  I sold covered calls on my 300 shares 4/16 17c.  Obviously I am losing a shitload of money on those.  Is there any way to salvage that?  If I buy back the contracts it will cost me like 4k each or something stupid.

I also have other calls that I bought.  I should exercise those right?

Cramer is a covid alarmist who spreads irrational fear as a shill for big Pharma. He should not be on tv, as he causes panic and is unglued.
Okay, other users have said they're setting multiple limits so I guess that's just on the assumption the price skyrockets, and if the system checks and sale price is below step 1 (assuming there are three steps set by the person), nothing happens. But the next time it checks, maybe the current price is beyond step 1 and step 2 so it sells at the step 2 price?
Reading these comments for Tuesday.
Hmm maybe the magic will happen in next earnings call not this one. Stock has really taken a beating for a few months now

Twitter is run by morons. Case in point, their acquisition of Vine. Something that had been properly nurtured and managed could have ensured the whole "tiktok" fiasco never even happened because we would've already had Vine.  

Instead they killed it. 

It's more than Jack, but I have he's a huge part of the problem. The company has been spinning its wheels for years and now that they've banned their biggest attraction they really have nothing to show for themselves. 

Twitter has also been teeming with bots for years; somewhat because by design its allowed to. The problem is this has lead to Twitter becoming, what I believe is the least organic of the social media platforms and far and way the most inconsequential.

Why is your go to is my Reddit history? Lmao. When I was 18 I applied for 3 personal loans and asked my parents for $4000. When they said what I said Apple because of the iphone. They laughed and said things similar to what you’ve said here today (minus the reliance on a tiny Reddit history). I had no credit the banks said no. I said to myself “oh well who am I kidding i would probably lose it anyways” and went on with my life. 

I’m not going to waste my time because I already know all you’re going to talk about is one of my maybe what 5 WSB posts that aren’t comments? (Which is well under 100). If you judge everyone based on these limited internet profiles, you’re a genuinely ignorant person. Bye bye I’ll check in down the road mr garbage man take care.
Good point I'll probably just ride my 12 shares rip

I agree with you its important, see my other post in this thread.  I just think in this case its not helpful.

There is a very important difference between being racist against chinese people and being anti CCP. But, all their stocks lie, and pooh bear controls it. I ain't got nothing against the chinese. But the CCP is the enemy of the world and we should not support it under any circumstance. I didn't say chinese people suck. I said fuck china, fuck all china stocks, and if you like the CCP so much you should go move to china to suck pooh bears cock. Would you have bought russian stocks during the cold war? Fuck no, let them fail. China stocks are shit. If they go up it's only a matter of time that another LK scandal comes out and the stock implodes. I am sure there are innovative chinese companies, but I don't care and think investing in china is the most evil and unamerican thing you could.

Also, the most anti china people I have met are all immigrants from china that wanted nothing to do with china again. They were the biggest donny pump supporters I knew. At my work 3 chinese guys hate china and 1 loves it. After a few months the idiot went back to china and the other guys think america is awesome and we should be truly thankful for our freedom.

It's neat tho, but not made the right way. Ideally you'd have the client get content directly from reddit via js and just use client-side text to speech. 

That'd scale to thousands of users easily and be cheap to host. Instead he renders the voice server-side and pipes it over, which is easier (is it?) but heavy af.

Remember when you guys would talk about weekend Dow? Didn’t see 1 post this entire weekend! Plenty of solid DD on GME$top however, well done!!!
Well if Sunday and Monday the market is closed so futures don’t mean shit. Idk what you should have I have leaps tho
I’m a millennial and I barely understand them.  I also use Fidelity.  Borderline boomer in this sub lol
I've got $1k, whats the play, buy a grand worth of shares and hold on?
I like how you think. 90% of my portfolio is in GME and NVAX shares and calls. I think GME might be the safer play, but both have huge potential. I'm adding another $10,000 in GME shares Tuesday (if it's not up 25%+ premarket). If NVAX reaches $160+ this week, I may sell my options and buy more GME (assuming GME doesn't squeeze this week). If GME does another 100% gain this week, I will probably sell my options and move into NVAX shares and/or options.

Long-term, NVAX might be the better play (if you're a boomer and hold stocks over a year), especially if COVID is seasonal. $1000 SP in the next year is realistic if there vaccine is as good as promised.

My first ten bagger is the calls i sold against my BB shares. I like to call it the reverse ten bagger 😂
Remind me! 1week
What I’m asking is if this squeeze happens, will it be right at open where all the orders were placed over the weekend rendering me unable to buy GME before the pps soars?
I'm using Robinhood so this is my experience only for that. But setting a stop limit means that the shares will only sell if the price point is met, or if it goes higher then the price point. 

So for example I can have a share set to sell when the price reaches or exceeds $420.69, then I can set another 1 share to sell only if the price hits or exceeds 694.20, and then another share for $999, and so on. The limit can be set to expire by end of trading day, or 90 days. 

Again this is just Robinhood, if you use something else the fundamentals are the same but the process might be a bit different?

That's true in most situations.  I usually just play it off and joke about it but sometimes it really is malicious and the situation calls for a strike back so they don't do that to other people in the future and reconsider their actions

Football mindless and boring af.
Tx for the DD, great insight and really highlights the importance of not buying shares on margin and being patient.

My only thought against your thesis is; if the case to buy the remaining float stock, which would put Melvin and shorters into Checkmate, why wouldn't Melvin and other shorts buy the remaining stock to cover their positions and potentially make huge gains if the squeeze happens? They have the capital to do it faster than WSB can come together hold said shares.
[removed]
If this is your theory, why don't you just make all of your money every week by just looking up any major stock made a major move on M-Th and reversing it for Friday, every week?  

You could probably buy slightly OTM FD's for nigh-pennies midday Thursdays and then flip them ITM on Fridays for enormous margins, with risk split by doing this among tons of different stocks, if it were this simple/predictable.

Well why isn’t this getting more attention? Most of these users have RH accounts and in their terms and conditions apparently all RH accounts are on margin since instant transfers are verified as available funds.

It's still GME. Shit hasn't even started to squeeze yet. You want to get rich or watch others get rich?

ok dude, you are a smart guy right? I guess you are. Are you ugly? I mean you can't be that ugly, you are probably average right? If you are smart and average, there's a shiton of girls out there for you. You are probably not targeting the right ones. If you go for a classy/sharp look and you are minimally funny (like you are witty, use sarcasm, and so on) you can go for smart girls, they dig that. Some of them are hot too, so really, stop worrying men, I'm concerned
This is only an arbitrage if you are not operating on margin, the difference in price reflects the margin financing costs to the end of Q2 when the merger is likely to take place.
I asked about this yesterday and got downvoted to oblivion. Dont they have circuit breakers for this type of stuff? 77 shares at $36.50
Nice! Thank you and let's gooo🚀🚀🚀

Tech development is expensed immediately as incurred. Hard assets including a partial building can be capitalized as assets. Software development cannot.
I feel like this doesn't exactly answer my question. If the big guys wanted to the squeeze to happen now, they can do it because of how much cap they have. So why not? Why the wait?

VIX hasn't updated...
Both are BETS on a business turnaround. The short squeeze is an accelerator which “may” pop the share price to insane levels for at most a few hours for GME. But GME is a bet that Cohen is going to fix and save the company and restore it to its former glory and BB is a bet that Chen is going to fix and save the company and restore it to its former glory. Either/Both could succeed or fail. This is a casino.  Hard to see the future is.

no if you live in cities in any of those places you’d be fine. ofc there’s always the occasional racist but calgary is one of the most diverse cities in canada, halifax has a neighbourhood that’s almost 70% black, montreal is a large city and very multicultural. even in the rural areas i don’t think people would treat you differently as long as you treat them with respect. i asked some of my black friends what type of racism they’d experienced in canada, a few couldn’t think of any incidents and the rest had 1-2 things with white trash crackheads calling them darkies on the bus or whatever but that was the extent of it. if you were aboriginal it would be a different story

That would be too obvious. Obscure, double meaning is much better and safer. Infinity symbol, peanut valuation, retard on a meme? What else do you need?

On the other hand, if questioned RC can always say that he meant that WSB retards are actually nuts, or current valuation is nuts if you will.

Plus it's boomer-proof, which is always nice.

Brilliant move Mr Cohen. Brilliant I say. Time to load up.
I feel like no one on the sub understands how programming and algorithms actually work.

IF there are institutions with enough vested interest in this sub that they will spend money creating tools to scrape data, then they will also have data analysts to help mold the tools and data found.

When they came across $SEARS being fucked to death, it raised a flag, since that's not an active ticker.

Then, they informed the programmers of what SEARS translates to. The programmers programmatically translate SEARS into Roblox.

Loaded to the tits on shares and calls. Idk why folks aren’t recommending calls, doesn’t make sense to me. Huge call volumes will rip the balls right off the shorts. Yeah theta is an issue before we know the squeeze is going to happen, but it’s now and it’s time to go full retard.
Only go up
You were right!
Futures green!!! 🚀🚀
They actually won prop 22 in California (where I live) and have added benefits for drivers. 

Yes they might deal with some lawsuits here and there but in the long run most drivers are very very happy. Nobody wants to do Lyft as a full time career it’s a side hustle in between jobs. 

Trust me you don’t want to miss the boat on this. I’ve been buying since $22 a share and will continue to buy.  I can send over my DD if you’d like.

They will never not execute the order if it is possible to do so. If they can get a better price they will, but they won't wait.

Percentages have absolutely nothing to do with it. You set a price and they sell for that price, unless they can do better.

Well, there are years worth of Losing that -apparently a lot of hedge funds are counting on continuing....I don't know if people hate GME I think it is like Blackberry in that people REMEMBER its past-NOT ITS FUTURE and the hedge fund fools are not aware of the new paradigm both companies have planned-They were counting on both companies dying like -plenty of companies actually did-And in fact GME and BB have a plan for the future that is promising-I 'get' the desire to stick it to the hedge funds arrogance as a side benefit that does motivate me.

Here with my BDE for Cohen and GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
https://www.fiercevideo.com/video/deeper-dive-what-facebank-and-why-did-it-merge-fubotv

“The company said the merger will boost fuboTV’s international expansion plans by giving it access to Nexway AG, which operates in 180 countries. FuboTV also said that it will potentially use Facebank’s IP sharing relationships with celebrities and other digital technologies to enhance its sports and entertainment offerings, which include the Fubo Sports Network.” 

Yup, that was covered in the merger with Facebank.

Commented FaceBank founder John Textor: “If you think this is a video game, you’re wrong. This won’t look like anything you’ve ever seen on Xbox even in 4K. Our virtual championship boxing will showcase the talents and technology of the visual effects community, combined with the most respected of the military simulation community. Our aim is to build a visually stunning, championship-caliber bout that positively impacts the future of fight entertainment.”

Fubo is also getting into simulated reality thanks to its merger with Facebank.

We will see how this goes, but meanwhile we have sports betting to look forward to. A lot of big things coming for this company that the bears don’t want to talk about.

Any news? Or are you hyped about factory?
Not possible
That’s a lot of blowjobs you gave. Congrats
Thank you for bringing this up.
In all seriousness, your point is valid. I apologize. I can't represent the whole post as it is a long post and it isn't fair for me to just pick out a few sentences. I don't want to turn this into a pitchfork situation. I will share the link only with those who ask. 

Please forgive me. I am as retarded as they come. I googled BofA and thought their market cap was actually only 1.13B because that's what Google said. 

Speaking of leaps though... maybe I should buy leaps!
but why tho
What is happening to SPY? :((((
Browns deserve to lose that. Play calling just fucking dogshit
No. Where have you been?
All of this is unprecedented given the current  SI, however volitity (in both directions) will start getting more and more insane as the volume contracts.

When you clarify the error and deposit the funds, you get to keep your gains. You did what is known as 'free riding.' Your account will probably be flagged for the future and you will only be allowed to place trades with settled funds. Work with the fraud department, explain and provide them the bank and routing info.

All great but thinking you can make money off hosting board games as part of an arcade is a pipe dream - unless you're selling liquor! Now be sure to hire bouncers to handle the crybaby drunk losers of said games.

he is just making fun of us. surely he cares about the company, but definitely doesn't care about short term spikes of the share price. all wsb was waiting for his tweet this weekend to moon the stock and he knew it. but he doesn't care, he has nothing to say now, since he is in for the long term. so he posts a peanut (shaped like a dank rocket) and knows that we will cling onto that exactly like lloyd in the gif. do you retards need a rocket to jerk off tonight? cool, here is a peanut, now pull out your dicks.

Guys. We are going up big next week. Do you all really think that the peanut being the exact same orientation as our rocket is a coincidence? He could've picked from any of the emojis.

People are trying to make sense of what the peanut means, but there's no use. He's just trying to make a 🚀 that would not expose him to SEC troubles. Next week is big fucking rockets. There's nothing to decipher here. The peanut is simply a rocket without actually being a rocket.

Tldr: RC doesn't need you to look too far into it. The peanut is oriented like the rocket. He's just making a rocket while avoiding SEC trouble.

For some reason no one here seems to fucking be aware of the most basic concept of the business cycle. Go look at the debt levels right now. Credit expands, and then it shrinks. How anyone can look at our current debt and think we’re entering another long term bull market is so weird to me.

Which one to invest?
You’re right. He probably doesn’t care short term. The short squeeze would be a by product of any long term news he has.
A squeeze would also greatly benefit shareholders by letting him do an offering at the top and get as much possible funding as he can.

So IF NVDA closes above 537.50 on Feb 5th and I post a screenshot with my $8,000 gain you are going to Venmo me $1,000. 

IF NVDA closes above 537.50 and I post less than an $8,000 gain I owe you $1,000.

IF NVDA closes below 537.50 on Feb the bet is off.

Bet is enforced by a LIFETIME BAN on WSB.

Yeah nobody gives a fuck you worked retail. King Cohen is creating an ecomm giant.
You're actually wrong on this.  Options that are just slightly OTM are usually worth 0.01 sometimes more at expiration. You won't get max profit if you close out before market close.   Otherwise,  you're taking on after- hours/weekend risk. 

Anyone with a real brokerage can submit instructions to exercise their long options 90 minutes after market close.  If NVDA gaps down after- hours,  you're fucked.

Thank you sir
The brokers are raising margin requirements. Normaly they require you to have something like 50% as colletaral in your account. They now raise that to 90% or even 100%. The stock might trade flat and you still get margin called if you do not have the colleteral.

Puts on Uber wtf is this commercial
Analyst price targets for NFLX are between 500 and 650 going in to earnings. What price does the chain of put panic selling and short covering in a last minute run up get us to tomorrow?
I love how committed we are to losing money 95% of the time... the other 5% is a 5% gain
Stop that
THis shit is gonna plummet
Browns won’t punt I bet
Did you see my aunt post a large gain on WSB? No. Did it stop her from living off of more than I make with less than 500k to do it with for FIFTY years? No. This was with a moderately conservative portfolio - taking almost no risks. It’s not a get rich quick and retire to and island. I just don’t want to work my 60k a year for 2080 hours of my time job that is not shit and EASILY replaced with investing once proper foundations are laid. I’m not claiming to be an elite trader, but I’m also not an idiot. I know multiple people making a 6 figure living doing various forms of trading. I’ve had co workers get laid off and now they are full time traders. Are you saying I know this many “elite” traders? No, I don’t. I don’t think any of them would consider themselves elite traders. But what’s their favorite part? The freedom.

If I started 5 years ago I would be a millionaire today, not working other than trading. If I started 10 years ago at 18 I would be a multi-millionaire. But I was a dumbass and decided to blow my part time income on typical 18 year old shit and then go to college blowing it on typical college kid bullshit. If  WSB or some sort of investing community was so easily accessible maybe I would’ve gotten interest beyond the “shoulda coulda woulda” far sooner. After years of putting it off I’ve finally started trading with everything I had to my name and 10 months later I’m up 230% while being under certain job-related restrictions in terms of hold periods and securities I can engage in. I don’t need validation from a Reddit sub to take a $500k foundation and make more than I do working my finance job. I’ll find you when I do; send you updates over the next decade on my life since you’re so captivated.
Might do one at 420 to cover my initial investment, then keep an eye out on how high it goes. Effectivly we set the price. If all us autists set our sell orders at a grand it'll go to a grand, we hold the stocks they have to buy to cover their shorts. If we refuse to sell to them the price will just keep going up.

Now remember im a fucking retard and I'm pretty new to this, but from the the rockets hips I've been reading im pretty sure this is how it's gonna work.

Also why it's so important we 💎💎👋👋
Can I have your bike

Some idiot here definitely yoloed into gme and has enough to donate now. Gofundme?
Thanks for making it anyway.
It is missing a very important metric through PEG (or any other that will help encompass price v growth).  

Lots of tech companies are being valued based off their historic or forecasted forward growth.  It is also not uncommon for those companies to be showing 50% yoy growth.  BB's rev is currently at 10% growth over two years and down over 3 years.  Their recent quarterly numbers don't look show up 'up and to the right' trend either.

I have not looked at the filings but there is a chance that segments within BB are going 'up and to the right' while older units are winding down.
You’re sick!

Google does not have a better way to track users for ad performance, nor do they really care.

They can charge 10X what FB charges because of user intent in search. The clicks cost as high as $200 for some industries. This is never the case for FB. They are a traffic junky machine.

Full after one day looool. Top company lol. „End of software development“ literally means that QNX is already finished and working in many cars. VW OS is a prototype. I haven’t seen it yet, did you? There is no reason to built another software - VW doesn’t want to pay licenses and wants to make more money alone. I don’t trust the company anymore!

Following this non the less... I've struggled to find a broker cheap enough that actually offers stock options, most just offer indices etc...
You were funny?
Sounds like you're getting one hell of a birthday present. 🎉
THANK YOU

could be calling us retards nuts
Bearish
You are the one spouting off conspiracies with no facts and then demanding I produce research to  conflict your piss poor statements??? Fuck right off mate
I'm considering switching my 50-50 TSLA-GME portfolio to 100% GME on Tuesday or Wednesday. The more we buy, the better 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Tuesday US market is closed due to MLK day
Thoughts on bb options on tse? Low volume? No goodie?
Loving it
TO THE MOON BABY!!! 🚀🚀🚀
Dont give the shorts an inch!
u should be a director
Yeh I’m think probably late March. Also the added fuel of the flu vaccine could mean an extra booster. Very happy even though I’m 30% underwater.
aah, yeah no such laws in norway, so long as you pay back the loan all is gucci. Its actually recomended to invest it, its rent free when you study and the best loan you will ever recieve sooo ahahhaha to the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I'm in the same boat, stay strong 💪
People here think a once in a decade infinity squeeze will happen sometime next week because of the circumstance surrounding the giant short position getting more and more painful daily.  As long as we can endure the pain it'll require the shorts to exit their position and drive the stock a truly silly amount.   Or not.  Who knows.  But folks have millions riding on it.
Calls won't pay get shares. Its going to be up then down by that expiry and no one will buy your options.
Trying to shut it down. That fucker
Ill do anything for an lotr reference
F
No
Yes. This is it
Guys I think I’m retiring from making funny comments. Only serious things from now on
Lets not get ahead of ourselves
ehh, not too bad, that is like a rounding error.
Would like to know your reasoning
CHIEFS ARE GAY
OK which one of you frogs wants to be my French speaking partner? I'm a B1-B2..
Market is closed Monday so its open Tuesday. As far as I know there isent any big news to be announced then.

Is being a 🌈🐻 a choice or were they born that way
Thanks for all your DD, but I'm staying far away from social media for right now, too much censorship to sort out presently
Good luck.  I didn't trust NVAX but it looks like they have created a really good vaccine candidate.
its gay bear emoji. Theres also more rockets than bears

Ok so if u do poor mans covered call, u basically buy a deep ITM leap and then sell calls if u want to make even more profit on people who FD?
What's with the Tuesday? Why not Monday ? Why is everyone buying on Tuesday ?
I mean who cares lol.
Let the dude post and share the happiness


(Unless he yolos it and loses it like a retard)
Trade me your wife
$36 is my average price. Been buying since $22. 

Fully agree on LYFT being a 100billion company in the near future. They also have been doing paid robo taxi rides for the last 2 years in certain markets. 

I can send you my full DD if you’d like. I’m sure your all in either way. Time to get the rest of this sub to OPEN THEIR EYES. Lyft is going to the moon.
[deleted]
I think it’s best to set an obscenely high sell order, and just keep a close eye on all these variables. It’s such an unprecedented situation that the squeeze could be of biblical proportions
cramer doesn’t deserve our precious moon land 🇺🇸 yeet him to the gulag
m minervine tweets r a cock tease
ok
Why not both with dkng options?
I’m no bubble boi but any objective,non euphoric and slightly 🏳️‍🌈 🐻 could give you tons of examples of charts showing we’re almost at maximum risk on and close af to dot com valuations.
I am here all day trying to YOLO my money away and Reddit is promoting me Acorns app. I feel insulted.
Why not both? I make decent returns on betting sports. I need something to do on the weekends.
I'm in with 3/19 250 calls,  it's going to go insane after earnings in late February.  Could gap to 250, close March at 280.
i think youll see 50 next week without a doubt
Wtf do you mean in anticipation . Inauguration is happening .
We'll go bear when the market goes bear.

I got this double-ended dildo, let's ass2ass for tendies
Gamestop would issue shares way before it gets even close to that price range, besides VW had more float share than GME so this squeeze will be smaller
[deleted]
Where’s PLTR goin next week fuccs. Begin slow ascent to 33? Bottom of wedge at 23.50? It sure as fuck hated $28 on Friday
Gonna be honest how the fuck do I invest, I’m new to this and these terms are confusing
I hope you guys are taking into consideration that most people had 1/15 options. Be very careful moving forward, please. Only invest what you can afford to risk.
Hahah no worries. My original limits were set for 30 and up. So glad I cancelled before they filled!
I just registered as well- nothing recieved. They may possibly be having an influx of artists at the moment.
sold all my other stocks on Friday (except pltr) to yolo GME on Tuesday 🚀🌕
Is there a scenario that doesn’t end up in the good for us? I’m asking because you seem to have a pretty good grip on the situation we’re all in. 

I’m holding shares (probably not enough lol) long term because fuck it, but I wonder at what point (dollar amount) the stock actually levels without all the Shorts fuckery, like in a normal market scenario. Is it a buy until $50? $80? Where are the metrics that show what the real value would be if say, we were all merely buying shares with a... fuck man, I don’t know... 30% churn rate?
Please, tell me more
I assumed this would priced in, since china was already taken a path to reduce reliance on US based chip firms.
Okay :)
It will be at LEAST a month from when they finally release their data.
bruh it just happened...you even watching?
Yes, but he rarely posts on red days. Its silly not to believe that it is not a pump attempt at all
Like a bond
Basically anyone reading this buy at least 30 shares and do your part.
Now everybody in the $GME put your mother f****** hands up and follow me
[deleted]
Sad but that seems like the worst way to make money . Should have bought something with better resale or just used cash advance
Thanks dude 🤟
Yes yes
posts a peenut with a good movie meme 🤯🤯🤯
Tldr Version is people did bet Gamestop would go bankrupt. Gamestop did not go bankrupt, we hope to be in place when they pay back their betting debts.
It's probably Melvin commenting on their short position. As in they're literally retarded to think this thing will tank.
At least it wasn't a $200 bank error

>As you might be aware Lord Cohen tweeted earlier indicating that the stock price is peanuts and/or a reference to NASA and rockets 🚀🚀🚀

This is extremely misleading. He posted an emoji of a peanut, and a dumb and dumber gif saying "so you're telling me there's a chance". I literally have no idea where you're getting the rocket part from.
Bless you and your tendies
At least it's shares......
You guys got me fired up. Noob 1st post. To the moon we go!! New investor and I’m just about convinced.  I buy increments of like 500$ at a time Tuesday on dips correct? 💎 🖐 correct?
You guys doing sports betting now?
Thank you!

This place reminds me of 4chan ten years ago, before it got weird. Same tone.
So what’s the move for Tuesday cause I got 1/29’s and I wanna drop 2.8k on 2/5’s

What is GME
good luck
Why is everyone saying buy on Tuesday ? Why not Monday?
Didn't read but I agree that Twitter is oversold.   They will be focusing on better monetization in the upcoming quarters.  People extremely overestimate the importance of having Trump and his goons on the platform - Twitter has already surpassed a critical level of users, which makes alternative platforms who try to copy their style pointless.   Twitter will be fine.
This guys wife fucks
Thank you for the great write up. Optimistic for GME, but I’m unfortunately pessimistic for the future of WSB :(
We will never grow up
Tuesday’s going to be interesting. We could either see a lot of movement or it could trade flat as shit. Either way SEC rule 201 being in effect as well as cohen’s tweet just earlier, things are getting spicy.


Oh, so I would open up a small position whenever you can and just buy at the dips
Rule #4
RemindMe! 1 year "check this thread"

i mean yes.  but DFV has been posting since he took up the position and got shit on for it forever, so it’s pretty stupid to call him a pumper
Why would ride sharing go away in 5 years ? Lyft is already doing paid “robotaxi” rides. 

Their market cap is 15 billion. They also have 40% of the US rideshare market. 40% !!!

When self driving becomes common/regular, Lyft and Uber stand to win huge. We still have 5-10 years before regulations allow for fully driverless cars. Trust me, Lyft will win.
Take my upvote! 🚀
I mean, there's a chance we get a quick pump. Especially with cathie buying in. I have a feeling everything may drop during this week
boomers don't know how to use emojis, so they banned them
That’s the problem. Fake display of positions leads newbie traders lose all their money. Not that I care
She said he has a 1x 1m chance. So if I’m reading this right, ryan is saying GME will see 1m% gains🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

If it's anything like the Washington post interview we all better keep the tissues close
Big time. Dudes are gonna keep plowing money in right to the very top and even into the drop once it's over. They'll get saddled with some serious bags when they don't realise a dip is actually a falling knife.

Secure profits on the way up folks. You'll never time the exact top so it's best to scale your way out.

I’d be pumped if it got that high, but his limit order will never fill. If it spikes that high it will be very brief. Would rather have 100/200/300 limit orders set that will fill at those prices or higher and not miss out on the tendies

It’s not an “issue”. It helps push the price up because it keeps RH (or other broker) from lending out your shares to help shorts settle.

Yeah I'm banking on the current drop having occurred beforehand. Would like to see 550 just before earnings. Take my 10% and bounce before ER
Option r/r has decreased dramatically and since they are now expensive. But yes I do believe it will continue to go up.
Something is wrong with me. With covid deaths on the rise, I keep wondering how much cheaper social security would be and higher GDP per capita would be. But all that would be offset by the trillion dollars that are being printed.

I've lost plenty in options. I think I've gotten a good understanding of my gambling addiction now
My bad bro I’m confusing what I meant is like let’s say I wanna play a big play but have less money for that call on my account can I use margin to buy it and whatever I make I keep
It and whatever I owe to them they take it from the account with the money I made on that call? Like a Tesla call and it goes up a couple racks come up will I keep them or they take everything since I have less money in my bank
Yes I was being serious, thanks! RSVP crew now.

Also in SNAP as well. Got some good cheap calls when it dipped to 48 last week. Not going to hold through earnings though. Feel like SNAP might not live up to the hype it’s gotten and will go down after reporting earnings late January or February.

I'd been diamond handing GME since fucking October and panic sold it on Wednesday at the very bottom after the first spike. 31$ was my sell price, after which it obviously rocketed right back up.

I'd say that the biggest unknown is the merger and ccp. Outside of that, everything else, including trendlines, looks rather good. I can see those trends you were speaking to, but recent volume, RSI, and MACD are hinting at something bigger on the horizon, even if you remove the merger.

> The $100 million shelf offering, will not be sufficient, and GME will need to announce an additional offering to provide the necessary liquidity for this to fully unwind.

So I was digging into Melvin Capital and noticed that the founder Gabriel Plotkin is a former protege of controversial hedge fund billionaire Steve Cohen. His firm pleaded guilty to insider trading and right before that, Gabriel Plotin decided to go start his own hedge fund. I believe Melvin Capital held a position in Chewy (not sure if they still do). I wonder there is any relation between Ryan Cohen and Steve Cohen?

Honestly gme could go up so much even w/out the squeeze. Ryan Cohen has a cult of people behind him like musk, wood, and su. Shit if gme strengthens its e-commerce and make its stores into pc cafe/a place of gather, I see it go much higher than the 2.5B marketcap. These days any “growth” company can moon and gme is got a strong case behind it.💪💪💪🚀🚀🚀🚀

Insane going all in.
With WSB's autism, plus enough stonk YouTube channels making videos about how BB is an EV play & more, this can be $50+ in a few months. Let's do it.

Its cool to see things pump on the german exchange until we realize its because you have 1/100th the volume of even our premarket. Anything can be pumped when only a few thousand shares are traded, if you guys had any substantial volume ‘europoor’ wouldnt even be a meme...but here we are.
Don’t forget THE WORLD BOOK

Is this not illegal in Norway?
So yes.  You completely missed everything.  Your speaking 🌈🐻 unfortunately.  Do your own DD and hopefully you realize the future not the past.
That’s fine. Let them try to get people to sell. All they want to do is load the boat at a lower price. Anyone who listens to analysts = 🤡🤡🤡
64 shares reporting in, it ain't much...but it's honest work
Hes not pumping shit. It's a good value play inside a short squeeze. If you miss it don't blame us
That’s the TLDR of a TLDR I was looking for..
ICLN PT this upcoming week ?
My $7 shares must be cheeto dust if $35 is peanuts
I don't even know what shares are, but after seeing so many emojis and crayon charts, I'm going to get myself some of those GME candys you all tall about!
What has she been buying it in?
Peanuts are crunchy. Crunchy is the opposite of chewy. To the exits!
Both NVAX and GME will hit I think.
Good luck buying shares of anything on Monday.
if it crosses 135 by the 27th im selling, not feeling too confident tbh. Not feeling good about the rest of the year either
Well first step’s first. Divest from margin. My plan’s been drawn out and surprisingly I don’t even need to touch any PLTR to make that happen 🤪
Lyft’s revenue will grow exponentially in the next two years. Lyft only has a market cap of $15 billion. They have also already given 100,000 paid “self driving” rides in Vegas and Phoenix. We will see all time highs in the next 12 months.
That's exactly what I'm thinking too.

Have you read the rules here? This is defined as market manipulation. WSB has been audited for it a few times already. It's not the people in the comments who'd get investigated; it's people pushing stocks on social media.

God Darn’t. You are gonna make me buy shares in f’n GME. Ughhh.  Fine.
Can’t wait for the europussies to dump PLTR. 

Their agenda is always the same:

Buy high sell low
Domo Capital management posted:

"It means the current gains are peanuts compared to what is to come."
Dude I know, shares are universally shit on but the infinite time feels so nice, there’s always tomorrow. Also you’re not slowly bled to death with chop days. Also I like being able to taper in and out of position since I can rarely afford a whole bucket of contracts
On the one hand, some of them can't vote, on the other I'm glad they care
Exactly what I’m doing bro
For the first time in history we small fish win 🐠
Go for Jan 2022
I'm totally going to diversify. Shares and several different call strikes/dates.
If NVDA closes above 537.50 on Feb 5th that I won’t be up 3.22. That’s the bet you want to make? You really want to bet against arithmetic?

So are u basically saying we shouldn’t make calls, just buy shares?
Lol is gme the new quad witch or akshually free money.  Find out on this weeks the autist.
It's a stock that goes from 22 to 20 then back to 22 then back to 20 then back to 22 then back to 18, then back to 22. Sometimes with a peak in one or the other direction.

Would it be undervalued if it was a western stock? Certainly. But it's not. 

Would bought some time ago for the merger, but the investiagion and illegal gambling and regulations shit is too much imo. Could easily plunge back to 16 due to some "china" news. Or due to general market correction. Idk, upside has been there for years, everyone could see it, still it has no lasting traction.
GME
Ok... I’m going to say it.... there’s nothing more annoying then the GME spammers.

No. GME squeeze will happen tomorrow in Europe and stay at $150 for Tuesday open. Shorts will be trapped. Every short for themselves at this point.

Well, GME isn't dead yet. Do I think it'll reach >$100 one day? If they can really step it up, it's possible. Am I sure? *Shrug* I'm sure if Cohen is investing his time & money into something, he's like for it to succeed beyond what most people think it can. I'm in it for the long run with my few shares and I'm just going to hold.
Wait is that what ended up happening to him? LOL

Thank you for that I never followed up after the coverage of his idea
So real question here when would be a good time to sell? this rocke obvious this is gonna take off like a rocket within a year

I’m actually in doyu a bit too. Don’t plan on sellin until this runs

You can't deposit your brokerage margin into your bank account. Is that what you're asking? When you sell it will lower your margin used until 0, and the rest is yours to keep.

Buying shares rather than options will allow others to not use those shares for shorts. If the price goes up because of good news/ Cohen then the shorts will be forced to sell at a loss if there aren't shares available. 

So we buy shares and hold onto them until the shorts fail at least.
Good strategy
We need a minimum karma, or some form of minimum profile age for these kinds of posts.

Way way way overbought. I’m good
Feb 5 532.50/537.50 bull call spread at 1.78 per contract. To calculate max profit take 537.5 - 532.5 = 5 and subtract cost of each contract. So max profit is 5 - 1.78 = 3.22.

hahaaha yeah idc if i go broke next week
Just to add to this: 

\- Lenders could theoretically recall their shares a any time. In practice, they most likely won't because they are making bank with the borrow fees. 

\- There may also be an element of risk in covering the short position because of the potential for a squeeze. If the people who believe in the squeeze are right, covering will create a whole other problem for the shorters, which they might deem to be worse than their current situation.

You're either naive, blind,  or both. What's their "big problem"? Brick and mortar stores?
If I see one more question about the Greeks, I’m gonna crap my pants
yes, it is a Canadian  company after all
I've heard good things about "InteractiveBrokers" though I haven't tried them myself. I believe they do us options at somewhere around 0.25-0.50$, not sure about that though so check it beforehand if you want to use them.

Good luck with the yolo's ya retard!

With Green / clean, I wouldn't worry about 1 day moves. It's the dumbest thing you can play off. Energy generally fell on Friday, but the trend is very much one direction in the med-long term (up).

TSLA $900 EoW, $1000 EoM. Lets go!!
Pat her on the butt and whisper "GME to the moon" in her ear.
Nevermore.  Weeklies are just too stressful and make you make emotionally driven moves.  Monthlies with 6-12 weeks until expiration. Close half way before expiry or unless I meet a goal for gains. At least with longer dated options you can generate a mini thesis.
what's happened to this sub?
I meant because markets closed tomorrow lol. I currently am in SNAP, BB, and AAPL positions that have made this weekend a sleepless one
You can still buy on Tuesday at opening my friend  🚀

Sorry, couldn't hear you over my rocket engines.
I am trying to understand if there was a better entry (for example in October 2020) without giving away a lot of profit
And don’t set your goal too far, or you won’t make it and it hurts psychologically.
That is very stupid. You will never win if you keep flip flopping in your choice. Stick to your choice or diversify into all of them. Trying to time market and it's likely you'll miss both and be stuck holding bags instead of riding rockets.
You actually make a pretty fucking valid point.

I have enough cash to probably purchase 150 shares? Maybe 100, I have to do the math. Also if this scumbag would settle my slip and fall case I’d have 25k in my hands for GME. Worst case scenario is I meme it off and best case scenario is I go to the fucking moon on my space yacht (yeah I’m making the ETF with Cathie PM me if interested).

So basically I could do your plan. We’ll see what happens Tuesday. I believe there might be a spike in price. Hopefully.

I started with 225 bucks, a 2% increase on that a year ain’t getting me nowhere. Big money, big plays. I’m driving a Tesla by summer.
Keep adding Cramer to these memes! He will keep mentioning WSB and maybe....just maybe, he'll make his presence known.

The different with green / clean, is that it's not a bubble, but the start of a new and growing tend and sector. Kind of like the internet was in the year 2000. IT's very early days, and tbh we're not even near bubble territory yet. You'd be silly to short the internet in 2000. 

Green/clean will dominate in the years and decade to come. You should have some of your portfolio allocated at least.

MLK day
way too much gamma risk selling weeklies lol
i've been in this for about 6 months.  waiting for something to happen
I get your point. I agree with that too.

 **Failure is a trickster with a keen sense of irony and cunning.  It takes great delight in tripping one when success is almost within reach.**

That quote describes what I'm taking about perfectly. I see that little trickster everywhere. The moral for me is when all seems lost and you're about to stop, it's a sign to go harder at that point. Overcome whatever is infront of you because you're probably close to winning.

In the car earlier I had a podcast playing. With David Goggins. He mentioned a part called taking souls. I got a similar vibe off his philosophy. He said nothing can stand in the way of anything which keeps on attacking it. I liked that.
This is WSB, not Berkshire we only care about 🚀 😤
You mean Maucauly Caulkin? He is grown up. You’re way off.
Ryan Cohen definitely turned chewy into a massive brand. I buy all my pet's food from there. So I'd say they have that going for them.

So you think the price will spike to $1000? That’s a little too far, even for a retard like me.
I'm probably going to buy a few calls on Tuesday, but the problem is: WSB is too fucking big. Our dicks swaying together will outmatch anyone else at this point.

We're the biggest whale in the market imo.

*66k. There’s a updated positions in the comments. I had too many pictures I gues. Tesla was my first stock when I was just starting out. I keep it for nostalgia. If you see the account a year ago to the day I had less than 6k in this account. Would go on to add 70k ( most of my life savings) after losing half of my account in March.

Few questions

How many outstanding shares are left in circulation?

Wouldn't it be better to let the short sellers sell more short and eat the rest available and then anyone can sell 1 share on the market for $500 effectively popping and causing the squeeze as figures are calculated on the last traded share?

46k+ GME shares and only 1 TSLA share? Lol
I have a small position in GME relative to overall portfolio (1500 shares with very small amount of calls).  So whatever happens doesn’t really have any impact on me personally whatsoever (my calls that I sold two days to early last week would have been nice though lol).

I only say that as a preface to main message which is - thank you for the write up.  There is - unfortunately - so much garbage posted as a new post or as an add to the daily discussion thread which had made it itself almost worthless for 8 or 9 months (my god - the almost FB like live streaming comments during press conferences was unbearable) and its nice when there is actual thought put into opinions - whether they are right or wrong or agree or disagree.

I wish some of the massive amounts of group think posts and posters would think of the lack of value they add when they simply try to add something of no value in efforts to try to be funny and/or get a pat on the head (like an upvote) from other uncreative folks that are simply like minded - and have 300 whole dollars they are using to validate their petty comments.  

Part of it is expected considering where we are -  but a lot of those that have found value here and post simpleton level barbs and comments should remember something else that is valuable (and would help make it easier to find valuable information) - silence ...
Nothing because the markets aren't open. Sadge.
No you won’t. What’s your cost basis and date? Feb 19? I’ll put 1k that you won’t be up 180% of the ask from the current spread if the underlying is up 5% from the current bid

I’m aware of them, but I don’t use them. You should give them a download and try before you buy.
There's no way to not use it derogatorily, even if it is done in good intentions. It's an ableist slur.
This is certainly my autistic hope. However, I didn’t know if I should save a few hundred dollars or more if possible - because then I could buy more stonks. 

My only fear is if I do it on a bad day and the stock goes up immediately as I make the switch. I’d have to wait for it to hit 37.7’ish, then go down. Which - I have no fucking clue if it’ll do that lol.

"Imagine" being original
Yeah definitely. It's sucks that I sold some but I put it back in before it shot the fuck up. I'm expecting a big announcement before market open on Tuesday!

Should I jump on the SPCE wagon or BB omg
I had a similar mistake where I trasferte some money into my Schwab trading account. It showed that money was available to trade. However the money actually did not go through, It was corrected the following day showing that nothing transferred. In this case, just like yours. It’s their money, with a banking error. So yes, they will likely keep it, as your 40k doesn’t exist (at that time, in their platform)
Guys if ur 🅿️🅿️ smol, make sure ur 👅 game good
Damn you fam! I’m already 1850 shares deep at 16 average share, with Jan 2022 leaps. Tuesday I’m moving 200k from retirement and buying more shares. Daddy needs to retire early!
So legit question, do you set a percentage of these shares to sell at the target price? Or is it if dupes below that price, so like the 694.20 limit will only fire if it passes that price then dips to it again? Is it if that price threshold is met for a certain amount of time? I don't know how limit sell orders work

Ah true. So what we looking at 😅
I was neutral with a cautious outlook before reading this.  

But this is poorly written and assumes a same operating and financial landscape to support the thesis going out in time, which is insane IMO.  This is the biggest faux pas in modeling.

If this is the best bear case argument, sorry I will be bull leaning with every minute.  

PS. You’re going to have an influx of new money tomorrow with Cohens tweet today.
He could announce a dump then, doubt he would though

Great write up dude. I'm still a bit new to this, and have got 2 questions. I have a margin account with RobinHood. From a rough google search, it seems RH doesn't allow shorting. So would this imply:

A) RH doesn't have an incentive to increase margin maintenance percentages?

B) RH doesn't have anyone to lend my shares to, allowing my margin account to contribute to the restriction of supply?
[removed]
What kind of money is that?

$$$$ only
can you provide some context
Man I haven't had any gme yet. First thing when markets open up I am buying some, just for the lulz of it. You got me hooked with your DD.
>i’m new to this subreddit and don’t quite understand. is this actual advice to buy shares or is it sarcastic? never had stock advice start with “OK r___’s” before.

Legally speaking, nobody here is your financial advisor and you shouldn't consider anything you read on Reddit to be financial advice.

Ultimately, you are responsible for your money and have to decide what to do with your money.
Oh yes daddy Cohen, that's some good ball play. Now fondle the shaft by Tuesday and we're blasting off.

I think with people adopting and buying more pets as opposed to having kids there is a need for these companies. 

But the key is whether or not they provide enough value over going into Walmart. Pet insurance is probably going to boom too.

fwiw, I have the most amazing doggo that came to me in the weirdest, most unexpected way but she has filled a hole in my life I never knew I had. She's middle aged now and is slowing down, gets her arthritis shots for her knee every 12 wks and fishoil in her bikkits. I'm going to be gutted when she's gone so it's a reminder that I need to make the most of every day with her - and I probably have another four or five years. I'm welling up just thinking about.

Please. You can have both rich and poor boomers without it being a contradiction. Some boomers are rich, which literally any retard could have been given their conditions and advantages. Boomers love to paint themselves as these incredibly hard-working and tough generation when they're really the product of a bunch of horny PTSD-ridden alcoholic GI's who were given every chance to be successful and most of them are so retarded (like you) that they still fucked it up.

You are 100% right. This post (not the one mentioned) is garbage and should frankly worry anyone who is bullish on GME.
Ok then go look at your history for call sells being put in
What are we doing with GME?
You think I’m funny for assuming you can’t be an elite trader? You’ve literally never posted a large gain. There’s zero reason whatsoever for me or anyone else to assume you could.

Just back from the stripper club. This stripper told me she's all in on GME and BB. Then I asked her how she was able to afford her positions. She told me FDs were super cheap, and if they didn't print, she would just YOLO her paycheck on more FDs and recover her losses that way. I was surprised and she seemed very confident, so I asked her what she would do if the prices went down. She told me prices were never going down because GME and BB are guaranteed short squeezes and will moon forever.

What’s your strategy with BB? I’ve bought shares when it dipped a bit on Friday but I’m now considering calls but not 100% sure of the potential that BB might rise to in the long term.

I completely agree with you on GME btw, it’s a failing business with an ancient business model - all the gains are literally all hype with not much to show for

Thanks you for your reply Benjamin.

I have felt the same way the day i started using margin, bit anxious and restless. Luckily it was a great choice because i started using it during this pandemic and locked in extra gains. 

Im dreaming hitting it big with my investment choises in this portfolio. Im wanting to retire early and becoming wealthy in life. I guess im willing to take this extra risk for chasing that dream.

Thanks for your thoughts.

I’ve had a reoccurring dream for the last three days that GME took off! The excitement of watching the ticker pass the 100$ mark woke me up each time!
If I buy Wednesday will I be too late?!? Just deposited 5K into my account won’t be available until then
You had me until you said Bear gang. Go fuck yourself.
532.50/537.50 vertical call spread dummy. I can actually guarantee you that I will make 180% if it closes above my short leg at expiration.
But then we got stuck with 8 years of the farce that is trickle-down economics.

Ah nevermind 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
A lot of what you said was just made up retardation (your paragraph on gamma may be the single dumbest thing I have ever read on WSB..... congrats for that), but nevertheless you go the big point correct.... the GME squeeze has just begun.  It has a lot more room to run.
Where’s the post? $SEARS
GME volatility will make the EV stocks seem like stable boomer investments probably.
7.10 per share min sell, call sell executed at 710.00 per contract. Contract is 100 shares. 7.10 x 100 710.00. You’re welcome.
Fuck TD ameritrade!  Just go full Karen on their ass and they will probably just give you the money
Gme can’t go bankrupt they have a shelf offering to raise, and can use whenever. They may already have. These prices and volume guarantee it. You should just cross that out. 

I think a bear scenario that has good chance you didn’t cover is that the investor base that ran it here is an alliance of independent value investors. Value investors rationally would sell at this price or trim. And this sub is increasingly discussing this as growth + short squeeze. But the investor base is still mostly value. 

Wsb may not have the purchase power to replace those shares. Stock starts to languish leading to dealer de-hedge selling as stock doesn’t move and calls roll off the books and oom calls de-hedge, and shorts, who have been very patient, ride it back down and are happy to get out at $20.
If the market ever goes down just remember

**There is nowhere else to put money other than real estate and thats messy as fuck.**

If some cuck ever tells you to buy some beaten down value stock just remember

It was KBIO you're thinking of when pharma bro Shkreli [recalled](https://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/) his shares over Thanksgiving weekend.

>**As KBIO’s share price had been spiking, short interest had been growing.**  And Shkreli now owned 70% of the outstanding shares. Then on Thanksgiving Day 2015, **when markets were closed**, Shkreli tweeted that he had decided to recall his KBIO shares that had been lent out to short sellers.  The resulting squeeze was just a simple math problem.  When Shkreli recalled his shares, brokers would be forced to buy-in the short sellers, causing it to spike uncontrollably.

God damn, sound familiar?

Yes but Ryan C-Crest is basically signaling he’s gonna buy more GME to max his posish.

Why is this so difficult to understand? OP is talking about options, yet one of the messages says "$7.10 a share". Since options are not referred to as "shares" I called bullshit.

Considering he's using robinhood in a mobile browser with terrible screenshots it leads to reason that HTML was edited to show the numbers OP wanted to brag about and the typo "shares" is evidence.

I was thinking about ramen while making some to eat yesterday. It has been four weeks since I put together [Ready Player GME](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kgwys1/ready_player_gme_custombuilt_trailer_for_all_the/) , whereby our WSB hero parlays a day's worth of ramen money into a month of ramen money.

The thing is, Melvin has lots of money and has other investments that hedge their loss with GME squeeze. So I think they gonna 💎 ✋ as hard as us retards. One development I’m interested in are retail shorts. When the potential loss is infinite, their pain point levels will be much lower than Melvin/institutions. Retail shorts should start covering soon before they lose their life savings or, god forbid, their houses. The thing is, institutions always screw over retails. If the institutions start covering before retail shorts do, retail shorts are really fucked...
He was the goodest of bois I’m sure... I’m sorry for your loss.

This has been suuuuper enlightening.  Thank you for your DD /u/titussupremus. I've read it twice. I didn't learn how to invest until last year. Because of efforts like this and others (/u/deepfuckingvalue, /u/uberkikz11, /u/cpthubbard to name a few)  I've setup investment accounts for my kids (all under 9) and we are learning together. They know how to lookup companies and will have a better start than I ever did because of this sub.  It has single handedly made the market approachable to this random Dad.

I've also learned that I am a bull at heart and I like to see others succeed.  The idea of driving someone out of business to make a buck isn't my jam.  Call me hopeless, but I don't think that should be anyones jam.  There's people behind these numbers. If you don't like the people,  fine, buy puts on their incompetence.   For GME the script has been flipped and for the first time,  all their dirty tricks are falling flat because their boomer asses fundamentally misunderstood GME and underestimated the little guy. 

1900 shares @ 12.55, April Calls

 💎🙏 and gratitude to all of you
They had puts dude. A short squeeze doesn't affect them at all. They expired worthless and they lost their initial investment which was tiny compared to their AUM.
MLK would have wanted the markets open
It won’t default because they will sell on their shelf offering and are probably already doing so, so I disagree with you there. And I’m not sure they even need to do it, but they should. 

But this is far beyond the price value investors bought into and looked to as a target. Many will be trimming or dumping. Burry already trimmed at a far lower price but small. DFV trimmed this week when he sold his expiring calls and didn’t buy or at least has yet to disclose it. That board member also had his fund trim.

The only thing propping this up at 35 is the retail bid which wsb is leading. At 20 theres maybe a value bid, maybe. And at 15 there definitely is. But not at 35. At 35, it’s a growth bid, and you are outlining why the growth case around digital distribution is impossible.

One point I’d add is Sony, ms, Nintendo (and by extension google and Apple on phones) don’t allow or de facto don’t allow third party app stores and won’t unless a court makes them. For pc, steam is dominant and ms, with their unique advantages, and epic, with theirs, and cd projekt red, with theirs, and discord, with theirs all failed to compete. They are all better equipped than gme to fight there. In the event steam goes on the auction block, and Gabe Newell gets asked daily, gme would have to outbid Microsoft, amazon, google, and probably EA and Activision, and maybe Sea Limited, Facebook, Netflix, tencent. Any of those can dramatically out bid gme and would derive more value from steam in synergies than gme would.

Good write up thanks.
I think they still used to

Your first sentence can't be true if you made this post. If you read dozens of DD and don't understand the premise, go back and reread. What you mean is you SAW dozens of DD posts, didn't read them and now you're asking someone to baby bird the info into your retarded mouth.

If you think I can’t replace my annual salary with trading stocks after accumulating a substantial amount of wealth you are funny. I don’t need a lambo. There are plenty of people that make my annual salary on interest and dividends alone.

I don't think I can agree with that. I don't believe Cohen would invest so much money if he didn't absolutely KNOW that GME would not go bankrupt under his leadership. Maybe he isn't talking about the MOASS, but there's no way he is chalking it up to chance whether GME goes bankrupt or not

Yes. More volume of people blindly buying at any price is exactly what gives life to these pump and dumps. Of course though it's not really a "dump" since OP probably owns like 2 shares and is living out of his mom's basement. He just wants everybody to reinforce the currently retarded GME bubble.

I’m thinking the same thing... it hit the low of 30 and rebounded really hard. Honestly pretty bullish for the next month or so. But I agree, a correction down to ~25 is sure to happen
Definitely don't send a market order after hours. At least, so I've been told. Can get fukt. Unless you can trade on ECNs a few hours before market open. Or however that shit works.

I get a lot more stressed when I have debt.  I don't use margin and even though my allocation is very risky I'm not worried.  If shit hits the fan I can just hold shares until it turns around.  

With margin your shares may be liquidated and loses locked in. Personally I wouldn't do it but at 23 you have plenty of time to rebuild if you lose it all.  

I'm sure you've day dreamed about hitting it big.  Have you thought about your reaction if your bets go south?  If you can handle it then go ahead and roll the dice.  But be honest... if it would crush your mental health then reduce your margin to a number you can live with
Nice.. so there’s a chance!

I work in the industry on the game development side. I've really enjoyed watching WSB stick it to the shorts, and keep a dying business alive  (a dying business that has high nostalgia factor for me...I spent much of my childhood loitering in Gamestop stores).

That being said, GME really needs to reimagine itself to keep from becoming the next Blockbuster Video. I'll give you the view from the development side:

**Cons:**

\- Digital works way better for game-makers. We don't have to waste money on Cost of Goods. Customers don't have to worry about losing disks/scratched disks. We don't lose money to the re-sale gray market.

\- Consoles are becoming a smaller part of our strategy every year. PC and mobile are rapidly growing markets that are way outpacing console. Streaming games through a platform-agnostic thin client also looks like it could be the real future of games. Even the console makers themselves are starting to realize that platform-exclusives won't work long-term (except for Nintendo...they play by their own rules and are really just a platform for their own games).

\- Microsoft's push to make XBox the "Netflix of Games" also doesn't bode well for the business. Sony is also looking for their own unique spin on content to compete with Microsoft.

\- Live service games are also becoming the dominant type of game. This again pushes the industry further from GME's model.

**Pros:**

\- The console makers do value a physical space where players can come to talk about games, buy game-related materials, and learn more about games. This why they've started to cut GME in on digital sales, and open up avenues for GME to sell games digitally.

\- Ryan Cohen. If RC wasn't involved, I'd be screaming to look for another stock to back. RC is the real deal and has the radical out-of-the-box thinking needed to really turn the business around. If anyone can think of a way to lead GME to greatness again, he's the guy.

**My Take:**

You have the shorts on the ropes. Go for the squeeze. But remember that squeezes are short-lived by definition. Have a plan to identify the top and collect your profits. After that I'd pursue other stocks until RC unveils a plan that looks like something you'd want to go long on.

I did not know that! Awesome though because I saw what she did to MAXR and SPCE (two stocks I'm deep into) this week. Gives me even more confidence now.
I also think that there are more players than just WSB trying to profit from a potential squeeze in the most shorted stock out there.

We will have to wait for some fund to boast with their squeeze profits, hopefully after a continued squeeze.

You are looking at a nice set of indicators. That's a great start. However, you brush of the unemployment figure ... with nothing. Why shouldn't we be concerned about the stalling labor market? You have to provide a little more evidence/analysis. 

Being overconfident in what you know is dangerous. As you continue your studies, you will realize more and more how much you don't know. In fact, the ratio of what you know to what you know you don't know will probably go down if you do it right.

No 🥜
People have borrowed a massive amount of shares, often on borrowed money, soon they will be forced to buyback shares. Unfortunately for them there aren’t enough shares floating around (not controlled by the board of investors or institutional investors who won’t change their position) to cover all those shares without buying from people such as ourselves who won’t let those shares go for anything under 694.20. Which means that the price will be 694.20 because the🌈🐻 HAVE to buy the shares to return to the lenders

Yes
Yeah, I had been playing calls  (sorry - newish investor) and it worked out for me quite well last week. But I used those profits and got into shares Friday instead rather than trying to time the jump up AND to help the GME gang since shares are what we really need bought.  


Squeeze or not, there is value here and I have faith in Cohen. His emoji tweets exude the ballsiest of confidence
No such thing as free money. I'd say with put spreads if it goes against you, it will blow your asshole out.

Come on man just make another play until it hits. get a payday loan if you must.

HUYA is such a good stock. Esports are booming and huya+douyu will control 100% of that market. Btw Cathie Woods has been buying this for the last couple of months.

Wour
Its tempting because thatd give me the most capital to put into gme. But its also my biggest loss rn. I know as soon as I sell it thats it will moon to 130 or something.
So a 30 bagger on shares bought late (~30/share) is somehow NOT a legendary squeeze?
I like how you broke each section  up with just enough 🚀 to convince  me to bug more GME.
That's because here there's an actual score card that either ends in Teslas or not being able to afford your internet bill.  A self correcting system.  Also 🚀 are fun

Alas, only so much room in the lootbag, though now that I think of it, could have just looped that gold chest animation again and brought some props to the BB gang too for a great week (I have some $BB shares myself).

This play has the potential to send a serious statement to institutions that don’t take retail investors seriously.
That’s what’s causing the cultish sentiment in wsb. Honestly though, it’s got good DD and ironically one of the safer plays I’ve jumped on lol

GME is the first. Do that then rotate to the others. 
Also pltr isn't gonna moon nearly as much as the others. It's a great long term place to dump extra cash it'll def grow bigly.
Fuck your shorts

Sir, we’re retards not schizophrenics
its one of the most shorted companies in the world right now.
IMO Vegas is selling Tampa Bay bets by pricing the line like that, aka they want people to bet on TB... I've watched 11ish TB games this season they have Brady but they have made soooo many mistakes and dropped passes and are not consistently dominant. So I don't see how everyone is super high on TB in this game against a very talented mature Saints team
guh don't you mean call credit spread?  either way ya spreads on GME are tempting
Any UK bruhs with this stock? Not listed on trading212.
Maybe you’re right. But it’s too late. I mean my school makes it hard to switch and there really aren’t any better state schools around.
I'm pretty interested to see what happens here. GME has been a hell of a squeeze so far but it's dropped volume from 144 million down to 46 million in 2 days. I want to see this stock skyrocket but my gut is telling me it will bomb hard by Tuesday close.
What price do you think GME Will peak at?
Great! Im pretty sure it will squeeze, maybe more like Tesla instead of a VW squeeze but if it doesnt youre still holding a good company instead of some random penny stock. If I do make a lot of money in a short squeeze and time it right I plan to invest most of it back into gamestop, but that depends on how low its going to drop.
Excellent DD. 🚀 confirmed
Any developments on that deal with TSLA?
The face of complete and utter determination 🚀

Only then will history come full circle 😬
What strike
Let's hope so. GME mooning only benefits me as well.
Might drop some money on RIOT weeklies on Tuesday... ShartCorn looks like it might be breaking out
TSLA ER is at the end of the month. But next week is quite a bearish sentiment on the market. I hope your calls will print  big
Interesting....it seems like you put some real effort and thought into this...thank you

Thought it was just a meme but there are literal high school kids on here who think they’re gods in a bull market. Lmao September 2.0 for the purge.
MLK had a dream, GME 🥜🚀🚀
One day an article is gonna come out that no one can buy GME stock due to retail investors not selling. WSB will have literally bought up all the shares lol
Yeah this is really merger arbitrage and in my experience these gaps will correct and possibly overcorrect. If APHA is undervalued to TLRY, and everyone buys APHA and dumps TLRY, the pressure should force APHA up and TLRY down until they are correct.
🚀🌕
Or a chance that GME doesn't go bankrupt/turn into Blockbuster. That's how I read it - probably hedging my hope to not get my hopes up for the MOASS

You mean put debit, right? It's call credit that's free $$

I hope they drop some news today, Monday, or Tuesday that makes us nut.

Yeah. It doesn’t even have to be them actually building it physically, just having someone with some knowledge guide you in person on what parts and how they want to build their pc and help you through the entire process of buying the parts from a central location is fucking gold.
Company goes bankrupt.

Stock goes higher.
I know a couple who got married on zoom and it was so sad and unceremonious

All this GME DD that keeps popping up is making me want to sell cash covered short puts so I can fuck over the bears and take their option premiums. And help GME keep a nice support level.

It's different because there's a lot more shares people will paper hand. 

I'm not saying it won't happen. I'm saying it won't be as extreme as VW or that pharma company.
My sell limit is at $900
I'd sell your GME at the peak on Tuesday and then buy more GME if there is a drop.
You gotta wait til Tuesday at 9 cause Monday is a holiday
It’s a sarcastic gif comment (who I’m guessing is suppose to reference the slow ones who are just catching on about GME ) and a peanut emoji , aka his response to what has happened so far = peanuts compared to what’s to come 

TLDR ; GME  🚀 🌝

Just going off their last tweet, all speculation on my part but I feel like no news is bad news.
Weekly put credit spreads on GME are free money if this thing goes peaNUTS next week aren't they?
i have been looking to get into it too, it does look solid. Just wondering if you had any more DD about its holdings (outside of the big names)
I've downvoted at least 2000-3000 comments over the last 3 days which even mention 'GME' or 'BB'

Went on a blind downvote run on Friday

Nothing off the top of my head. Just a handful of stocks from the last year that I traded. I just recall everyone always hyping up the rule being put into effect after a bad day, and it never lives the hype. It just ends up getting battered down for whatever reason. I’m sure there are exceptions.
Yeah people dont get how SLAMMED resorts and airlines and vegas and shit is gonna get
Hm. But wouldn't extending QE programs as well as bond buying signal to the market that the fed doesn't care about the value of the dollar causing it to drop again?
Yes lots of words indeed I agree

Should I go all in at market open or should I save some to buy in more later in the week
We'll only know on Wednesday when last week's margin data is released so we can interpret what the volume and price movement last week means.
You guys are all dumb.  This is in reference to Biden becoming president.
By raising taxes.

I don't think this is necessarily as bad as you guys think though, just cause she says it doesn't mean it will actually happen. J Pow doesn't give a fk about the dollar and Yellen isn't gonna challenge him like Mnuchin.
they will never get me to sell my shares until they hit $420.69 per share. They can fucking pry them off of my cold, lifeless body.
No I think it means they’re just going to let it go. So if it drops it drops. If they rises it rises.
$20 on Double 0.
Can I get your guys input?

Im in: MT, GME, VALE, TLRY, AMD, and BABA

Which one of these should I get out of to put more into GME?

The whole world's going green. Maximise your exposure against a weaker dollar by taking stock of ICLN.

With QCLN you run the risk of a weaker USD, so stock appreciation in a depreciating currency (vs. the rest of the world). ICLN overcomes that hurdle
Fuck if this works I'm buying a Porsche for them teaching us the way. Muskrat is so 2020, 2021 is the year we put the power to the retards and fully weaponize our autism. We had a Donny Pump and Elon sending the market up, but we have to adapt. We have found our new warrior.

As I said, that bitch cuts both ways - it cuts shorts when the price goes up, margin longs when it falls. Doesn't matter what side you are on, if you have 📜 🧤 or get a margin call, you're out, even if the position recovers in your favor in a day or two. I'm long but in a cash account, no leverage. Gives me piece if mind because it don't care how much it falls as I'm in it for the long run and don't need to sweat the daily moves.
Good luck!

Honestly think having a hub where people that actually know what they are talking about is key. Best Buy and Target sucks when it comes to talking gaming and computers. But anytime I’ve gone to a GameStop, the workers actually know the games because they actually use and play them. Having someone who cares about the hobby to help you get into it is gold.

Yeah I guess you’re right but I just thought it would be better to ask. 
I guess it’s time to double down on GME
Not trolling, the kid is in high school.
Why tf would I buy a company that never produced a single car. I am the guy who bought GME at 12, nio at 20, SPCE at 19, plug at 22, and t h c b at 11 though. Out of the 20 stocks I’ve bought since I’ve started, I’ve only lost money on one lol, and it was only $50. I’m a junior in hs but I make more money than you 😹😹
this „trend“ also applies on investment banking analysts lmao

How much margin did you have available? Clearly not $40K, but did they apply any margin towards this purchase? If they did, you might be entitled to keep any profits on the piece you bought on margin.

So the plan is that we just buy GME til we own it. Grab a couple board seats. If you can prove you own the stock you'll have a GME flair beside your name. If the price ever drops we know someone in the community is a cuck but its ok because we already knew that and we ll just buy the shares.

Eventually earnings etc won't matter a damn because noone is ever selling. 

Stock goes to infinity.
It's a matter of what your entire portfolio looks like. So what you really need to be asking is "how likely is it that my overall portfolio value could drop 50% or more and not recover for some time?" And of course no matter what is in your portfolio, there is always a chance that could happen (another covid-level market event could happen for example). But it's a matter of understanding the risk level and making sure you're comfortable with it for the portfolio you make.

Basically don't go 100% in on GME and meme stocks with max margin
The one and only.
“There’s a way to reduce the likelihood of a violation like one of the scenarios above, Herman explained, and that’s to have a margin account to help cover any shortfalls.”.

No you are smart taking profits. If you regretted it... next time consider selling half and ride out the rest

I honestly didn't know this was thing. Wasted 3 hours of my life if so.
You are not getting the profit. The question I have is why are they letting you trade when your money hasn’t settled? Patriot act allows several days to ensure any funds over 10k are legit. It’s their fault that you missed out on the gains... good luck convincing them of that tho.
What did you lose, exactly?
ICLN is the best play you can make
Jokes on you, I don't go to work until after market close. All I do all day is watch the GME chart from premarket to afterhours.

Thanks for your reply it really helps. If it doesn’t end up squeezing I do believe Ryan Cohen can bring GameStop back so I’d be fine with having this as a long term play.

You’re right, with the way this thing goes I could have my shares called away and wait a week to buy in at a lower average than I had originally, I could even see an actual profit from these albeit a small one.

I'm so glad death claws are friendly.. 😬
I'll obviously be paying attention to price action. I don't see it giving up at 80. There's always push back but $80 is not a ceiling for the squeeze. If it does drop to $25 on Tuesday, let's just say it's game over and I'll sell my shares, due to the fact if it dropped during uptick rule and RC tweeting then it's done. But I doubt that 100%
Can someone explain how online trade ins are gonna work, I'm retarded. 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I didn’t read a damn word of this, but I somehow ended up buying GME.

My question is, I have seen so much support for GME and I have done some of my own DD but I wanted to ask before investing. If I have about 2-3k should I just yolo all of it into GME or put like half in GME and split the other half into BB and PLTR?

Hey guys $3k in commons or $3k in long calls?
Looks like someone's getting a $10K learning lesson. Two pieces of advice: (1) don't screw up a bank transfer again. That's just sloppy and 100% on you. (2) consider applying for a margin account. Using margin wisely will help you avoid violations that are caused by using unsettled funds.

Im in on 20. And am contemplating a large (for me) yolo on however much i can w the physical cash i have. No margins also. Will get snatched away from you.

Happy trades short bus buddies

I don't see it hitting $200 myself. That doesn't mean it can't. What's your strategy of it hits say $75 though? What if it pops to $80 then in 2 hours plummets to $55. What do you do? 

What do you do if it drops to $25 on Tuesday?

I think it's better to have a philosophy and an exit/re-entry strategy rather than to arbitrarily pick imaginary numbers.

Friends dad was just telling me how his broker got him 14% returns in 2020. I was like bro, I lost that much in the first day. You gotta find volatility it's not going to find you
Your only dd was resistance lines and cathie bought a minuscule amount of shares lol
What's every limit sell for GME? I'm set to 420 atm but people are saying lower, some higher. If the lows sell their shares will it stop it from continuing to rise??
I’m pretty close, we are at the mercy of the market
It might seem like it was listerine lol
IMO this stock is volatile enough that even if it does get called away, we’ll have a chance to get back in at a decent price. Being confident about CCs means realizing you made a profit (if you pick a strike that is above what you paid for it) then keeping your cash ready to pounce when a new opportunity arises. I’ve been doing this a while in other securities, sometimes you win, sometimes you don’t, either way you don’t lose money. Except of course potential gains. Remember pigs get fat, hogs get slaughtered.

You need to find a bud on the inside
I mentioned this in another comment, but I've been with GME since 6$ and I have become cynical about the squeeze. Fundamentals alone this is still a value play, but every single mooning this stock has done, there have been tens of post saying with certainty: "Squeeze imminent!🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀". It's like the boy who cried wolf story only with a squeeze. It will happen when it happens, which is why I converted my calls into shares. People underestimate how long MM short sellers can last as well as how far they are willing to go to fight against losing billions. Remember, people murder people for FAR less then what these short sellers stand to lose.
The SEC is not the FBI and buying a stock isn’t the same thing as STORMING CONGRESS, are you fucking kidding me

Like someone said Cramer was talking about this entire scenario on his show and you’re worried about the SEC arresting you like you’re Jordan Belfort 😂😂😂

I agree with you, but the rest of the world does not yet understand.
I have a market order in for Tuesday. Lets bust the hedge funds
First time poster in WSB as well. Got to say totally agree. When you see the demand for all the latest graphics cards. There really is missing an awsome walk in type computer store geared towards gamers. I mean they exists as small stores but not with big market backing. Do this right and with the hard-on most gamers have for RGB the potential with the computer build side of things is massive. Lots people want to build a rig but are often scared (even though it is just plugging in wires..) well imagine being able to preorder your parts. Then go collect them and build your rig with someone watching over your shoulder at your local store. Make it an experience . Could have legs. You add value to buying the parts and all of a sudden you no longer need to just compete on price with the other component sellers. Done right I definitely feel there is a marker for this. But don't know if it is in their immediate radar. Some big.players to compete with (Amazon, ebuyer, Newegg) so they have to offer something different.

Read the whole thing. Excellent work, really helped a noob understand some of the jargon I wasn’t familiar with yet. I’m in the ASX using commsec, how can I help? What broker should I use to purchase GME stonks. And is there any way that this squeeze won’t happen? Some legality or clause to protect shorts???

Oh so you sold :( get back in!!
This isn't retarded. I make all my trades with 100% of my life savings. And GME is the closest thing I've seen to a sure thing in the market.
If you're looking long term, depending on the strike for your long options it's really no different than buying shares

Deep ITM options with a long expiration model just owning shares outright, but they give you leverage, so it's much cheaper than buying the shares outright
How long til we outright own GME
Nope, theres still a FUCKTON of shares being shorted.

So the squeeze hasn’t happened yet, or not fully.
Damn, I bought the equivalent of 40 shares in margins rn, I have 90 in total. Is it too late for me to back out now?

To be honest, my memefolio is out of cash, since its all in GME, so I can't afford TSLA calls at the moment. Only my boomerfolio still carries TSLA shares.

Just transfer your own money to Robinhood. Don’t use their margin investing. Leaps are option calls for far down the road. When you go to buy an option it will show you how far out you can shoot for

Investing in a stock isn't investing in a company anymore, not for us retail investors. For us, stocks are literally about identifying and predicting public opinion of a company. Wanna make money because people believe in GME for very good reasons and other people have bet against them for months in what is likely the most UNO reversed short selling spree ever? Buy stock!

For people at our $$, investing in a company happens when you buy their products, when you tell your friends about them so they buy them too. Want to invest in Gamestop the company? Check out their website, visit a store.

It seems you acted in good faith and if you had the funds in your account at the time of the mistake, they should see the error. And you could urge them to notify their IT development team that this seemingly simple “pre-check” of an account and routing number being valid or at least flagged as suspicious first before declaring all hell broke loose and suspend accounts.. You’ll be able to keep your gains is my bet.

Are you retard or just cutting your nose to spite your face? Borrowing money at drop dead low rate (much lower than a broke ass street customer can get) as a preferred bank client and allowing your assets to continue to grow at a higher than borrowing rate is the smart financial choice. 

Pulling out money is the poor broke ass choice. If you had said he should sell and diversify then I may agree with you. But pulling out money to spend on avocado toast and artisanal coffee? Hahahaha...good luck with staying poor.
Are you retarded?

Theta loves 3 day weekends!!!
In that case split it between leaps and 2 month out calls. When calls get 20-30% upside, sell and re-enter on the next dip but don’t be too quick about reentering. Buy the dip with half allocation and see if it’s gonna dip more, if it does, buy again with other half. 

I have 900 shares and about 100K worth of 240c and 250c February and March expiries. I’ve been doing the above strategy for sometime now with SQ. So far so good, except this past week.

Debating of buying shares not because of the DD but because of the sheer power wsb has on a stock
It doesn’t make sense to just give the ball away after a fumble out of the end zone. Do you think fumbling out of bounds should be an automatic turnover?

Sorenson led with the crown of his helmet which by definition is a penalty. To say he didn’t do that is ridiculous
Damnn, why would they keep it??
It goes up but not enough compared to the premium and the return from stocks would have better %
What is money though
Virgin orbit launch good so far. Bullish for SPCE if everything runs smooth from here
he thought it was a long time play when he bought at 3$/share and he thought it would take tears to reach 20$ ya
It’s horrible. My entire portfolio is in the weekend Dow

120 is nothing wtf, aim higher
I’ve said the whole time, that’s fumble rule is way more autistic than anyone in this sub. There shouldn’t be a change of possession. They should get the ball back on the 10 or something. ffs
That $10,000 isn't your profit since the trade wasn't made with your money. Good luck convincing them otherwise.
Better go buy some lube for the dime and a half you’re about to be serving in prison

This week plays:

AMD earnings next week and down 10% in the last 5 days. Looks like a solid buy going into earnings since the recent drop was based on optimism about Intel. February 100Cs are looking like a good play.

Blue Wave Stonks. I'm in ICLN, TAN, and MJ. Profit taking (SeLL tHe NeWs) over the last 10 days or so has created a great entry before 3 catalysts. Inauguration, Paris Climate Accord re-entry, and details of clean energy stimulus.

Nope, not Melvin. Just jelvin. Keep buying GME,  that squeeze is for sure coming. Tbh I don't but into the infinity squeeze, but I def think that it'll at least triple still.
100 shares exist. 99 shorts need to cover. I own 50 and am waiting for a squeeze. Price goes to 155. I sell. Price drops. 50 shorts are forced to buy. there are 49 shorters remaining Price goes up. Someone else sells 20. Shorters buy 20. 29 shorters remain. Price goes up. The person who was owed the first 50 shares that the shorter just repaid sells at 200. The remaining shorters buy at whatever price.
ARKK always goes up. If you want to split hairs on your entry point, set a good until close limit order

Not a bad idea.


Worth mentioning that Tesla’s price has still not come back to 🌎 from the squeeze.

The stock market in general crashes and it expires worthless.

Really? Twitch sells collectibles, PC computer parts and accecories, provides internet cafe spots and has cunning employees to help you with any computer/game issues? Damn I must have missed when the streaming company suddenly bought thousands of stores all over the US and started selling stuff instead of you know, being a streaming platform.

And like I said, shorts have 2 months before the costs of upholding their shorts exceeds any potential gains. So if you think it is going to take 8 months for GME to go bankrupt, there will still be a short squeeze lol.

Good questions. Just looked into it further. 
The new directors (Ryan Cohen, Alan and James- the dream team) have terms expiring at the annual 2021 meeting. During this period the board will go from 13 to 9 and our dream team will be officially elected (anyone can correct me on this). 

Form 8K says the standstill is the earlier of either: 
1. 30 calendar days prior to the deadline for the submission of director nominations by stockholders for the Company’s 2022 annual meeting of stockholders
2. the date that is 120 days prior to the first anniversary of the 2021 Annual Meeting 

Annual meeting is expected June 2021, so for #2 it would bring us to 2/1/2021 (2 weeks from now). This is great news!
Anyone else get a bad feeling that these investment firms are going to go crying to Uncle Biden about retail investors and beg for legislation that makes it illegal for us to run our accounts without 17 licenses and paying 10k a year in annual license fees?

I’m going to lie in the fetal position and cry until Tuesday gets here. Then hopefully GME makes it worth the effort to wake up on Tuesday morning. Might throw some more at BB if I’m feeling retarded enough.
Welcome on board! I dont think are doing nothing wrong here because you arent triggering a squeeze, you will need way more than 13 shares for that. Jim Cramer is talking about short squeezes so it shouldnt be a problem. Only huge buyers like Ryan Cohen need to watch out (thats why his tweets are so cryptic).  
Second of all, dont count putely on a short squeeze. We are dealing with big money here and they might have a way to get out before big moves have begun. This probably isnt possible but it is not a given fact that a short squeeze will happen. As long as you have faith in gamestop with Ryan Cohen and the new board, the risks are really low. Just diamond hand, buy more next week when you have the chance and enjoy!

Agreed. After this squeeze happens and the majority of us sell, what’s left is the value players who see GME as a growth stock with a brighter future. Any WSB’ers that stay for that are gonna have to learn to play rationally or lose their ass.
DONT GET GREEDY! $4200.69 is a HELLA appropriate price you fgts. Dont be getting greedy now.
That’s such an unfortunate play. He was an inch from a TD
QQQ 2/19 312p
I keep saying the same thing
We got ourselves a real analyst here. You do realize this isn't the first time this has happened. You do realize Genomics in general is getting more and more interest and will be bigger as an industry in 2021. If you were smarter you would put it on your watchlist and find a good entry point, even if it does drop that's just a better discount to load up more. "no upside for the near future." maybe if you used more than 1% of your brain you'd stop thinking about everything in "near future" terms.
I remember watching shogun assassin with my dad when I was like 6 I was fucking shitting myself for 2 weeks straight
3/19 15$ calls 🚀🚀🚀🚀
If you trust my DD yes. Holding cant go wrong and the squeeze is also likely
My conclusion based on DD from months ago is the GME is a value play at anything under 60$. If there is a decent turnaround, it could eventually hit 100$ in the years to come without any squeeze. Squeeze thesis is more fun though

Yeah man, no hate on anyone who can do this. This is by far the greatest internet community that's ever existed. I'm late millennial too, but the difference between you and me is you had something to start out with. Even though you hated it, your job afforded you some time to build equity so you didn't have to make such risky plays and still have decent returns.

A lot of young guys like me see everyone on wsb turning 1k into 100k in a month, but don't realize for everyone who does that, there are 100 shmucks who turned 1k into 0 at the same time. And when that 1k is all you have, you tend to make stupid decisions.

I was in on this trade, but now with the supply chain disruptions that are obvious everywhere now, sustained high unemployment and a government that will spare no expense with artificial stimulus to keep the house of cards in tact, inflation is coming. Stagflation actually. This will get ugly.

Just my opinion

Brokers cant remove your shares. Shorts are on margin and will get kicked out making buying pressure. Longs getting margin called is bearish selling pressure
My moves for tomorrow include waiting for Tuesday. Did 🏳️‍🌈 mods forget it’s MLK day? ✊✊

Well Im a Europoor, so I Guess Im gonna go fuck myself by buying more shares at 36-37
I have 30k in  the stock
Look at my previous post history. You will see I owned 100 April 30$ strike contracts I bought for an average price of only around 200$ per contract. Unfortunately, when Cohen announced seats at the board, I rolled them into 1/22/22 30$ contracts at the worst possible moment (gamestop was around 20$ at this point). Still made gains of 30k when it mooned, but it could have been 150k. Now, I have sold everything, took out 30k to pay off a car, and own 1900 shares @36.50 (doubled with margin which I turned on solely for this play)
That sucks my boomer dad is invested in GME and follows WSB! Fortune favors the bold! Maybe u can impress him with some nice gain porn!

XX,000 shares - 💎 🙌
see it's all very circumstantial. if ur call falls 80% and u have ONE YEAR or even one month left, are u really gonna cut ur losses or take the chance it goes up? I would def assume the latter. for OP he chose to buy a weekly with almost ALL his money on the line, which by itself is a huge gamble and he should have 100% accepted his loss once it fell below 50%. the greatest way to blow up ur account is not cutting losses, but putting ur entire worth into ONE trade.

I'm not going to lie, I lost a fuck ton of brain cells just trying to understand this post. It seems like you'd be over managing your positions and you'd just increase the most fucked up factor in anything: the human. 

**Just sell strike right above it basically creating a Bull call spread** I think this is the only one that makes sense. For KERN, if you're up $900 and sell a strike $1 above then your max profit would be $100+premium, so probably idk $1.50 if you're lucky? So $250. You'd be better off just selling the original option. If you do this and the stock price increases and then "sell the short" which is hilarious you call it that because it's called buying to close you'll lose money because the price of the option you sold to open would have gone up as well. So either way you're losing money. You should just sell the original option you bought to open. 

**Sell the strike right below current naked long call and create a bear call spread** Well, if both finish OTM you would get to keep the premium. If the option you sold is ITM and your bought option is OTM you're gonna have to find a bunch of capital to buy 100 shares of the underlying and then sell them all for a loss. And then if both are in the money at expiration you'd incur max loss which would be the difference in the strikes - the premium gained. Maybe if you're lucky you'd make a small profit because of the different times you bought/sold at?

*Or if you moved several strikes already sell the current ATM strike and get credited more premium* this could sky rocket in price and to buy to close this would negate any more profits you'd gain. I guess this one makes sense if the current price is above the strike which is essentially the first one just with a higher delta for the sold to open call. 

At any rate, you'd just be safer playing debit/credit spreads instead of trying to time so ridiculous strategy where there is a lot of opening and closing.

My .02. If anyone sees something drastically wrong with my knowledge let me know. To lock in your profit just sell to close.
Then stop banging my mommy!

Even IF this is MOASS, it will be stoped at 420.69 because WSB has the strenght with somewhat 5-10% to stop it at this meme number. An achievement, but also a sad tear will be shed, if WSB will stop it at this point.

If they shit on retail investors while letting illegal naked shorting run rampant for months without so much as a slap on the wrist... I wouldn't be surprised but I'd hate the system even more.
so you can sell 10 itm naked calls but cant buy one option on margin? edit: you mean that the margin req is = to max loss = option price ok ye ur right my misunderstanding
the tweet was so vague you cant DD anything from it though tbh. I understand next week the price could be held down a while so it's a good opportunity to buy but lets say 50-80 is what ends up being the high - avg price better low or just more shares...
PLTRalready has a 45b market cap, I bought some shares because of this sub, but how high do people really expect this to go to? If this doubles to $50 that would make it worth almost as much as BA , and PLTR already is almost as big as NOC

Why is everyone suggessting such low limit orders?? Set them for at least 420 you losers

Yep.. look it up, options aren't marginable unless you live in some country without regulations or trade CFD's like Europoors can, and get 100x leverage on equities.. I suppose if you count selling naked puts and calls then margin technically can be used as collateral governed by the margin requirement, but not to go long options..
If you look at the premiums for all those MM's sold on GME expiring 1/22, what do you notice?

They're absolutely insane! Implied volatility is ridiculously high. As an example, when GME was trading around 39-40 last week, the premiums for the 50$ strike were around 250-275 per contract. EXPIRING. IN. ONE. WEEK. That means if an MM sold 20 contracts of 50$ strike they would recieve a credit of around 5000-5500$. They make 5k in a week as long as GME closes below 50$.

Now tell me, how easy do you think it would be for MM's to stall GME for only a week? This is why I believe it won't moon next week.
Was going to make a post but looked at the rules and decided that a comment would be better. 
Ive been lurking WSB for a little bit and eventually my autistic self saw all the GME posts and I bought GME because YOLO.

What if it means “nut a chance”
That's the whole point. It sounds like a tautology but it works. The market is not bursting because people believe it won't. Whatever is done to further that belief, such as pumping money, is only gonna help that. Additionally, and this is another conundrum, the money, combined with low interest rates and the nonexistent bond yields are bloating the equity market, which in turn, is making people put more money into equities. In other words, stocks are going up, because stocks are going up.

Momentum. Every contract gain speeds up adoption by other competitors. PLTR does one job really well. Integrate data across multiple platforms easily and parse big data easily. What industry do you think has old data that needs to be integrated with new data? How about any company that's not tech and literally any company that existed before 2000? 

Like moneyball, once an industry adopts PLTR technology, others will follow suit for fear of being left behind. What is MSFT priced at? PLTR will be the same for big data analytics. And we know big data will be huge going forward. Analysts who can't see PLTR north of 1tn is frankly very short sighted. When will we reach that mark? Very very long time or it could be very shortly. I can't know. 

Also moat is quite thick, which is why PLTR can afford to be cocky. They have a huge stack of patents to protect their IP but more importantly Karp openly rejected working with China at all. China is now the second largest GDP country behind just the US. What gives him such big cajones to say that when GS, JPM are all licking CCP's butt to get into China and even the big and mighty AAPL and GOOG also kowtow to CCP and relax their own internal policies of censorship to access China market? Karp is confident his technology is far superior and cannot be replicated. Going into China will likely cause his tech to leak and copied, diminishing its pricing power and likely introducing a competitor in the process. 

So yeah, 8m now seems small for 50bn but let's not be stupid and discount the vision. Was Oakland a huge baseball franchise when moneyball was invented? These kind of revolution snowballs quickly. By the time you realize this, you can quote "in hindsight..." as much as you want but you won't be seeing the $$$$.
My conviction rose 30% from all time highs and is now sittin at 420% buying more shares on Monday 💎✋
Real quick correction: ARK purchased the 500k shares on Thursday 1/14 not on 1/15. They did make an additional add on the 15th but I think it was something like 10k.

In total, ARK owns just under 2 million shares of PLTR, so they added to their existing total by about 33% in that big purchase.

Another thing to look at: ARKW is currently comprised of shares in 55 different companies. Their investment in PLTR is .77% of the total investment wallet for the ETF. It currently sits at 52/55 for the portfolio in value. I do expect this to go up that list in the next month based on appreciation, though.

All that being said I am extremely bullish on PLTR and I think ARKs activity this week is a great sign, but I just wanted to put a little more perspective on the whole thing is all.

I can’t wait for this thing to moon before lockup, then blast off to Mars (after a small dip).

Why do we even have a daily thread this week. Everyone 💎🤲 GME. There are no other moves
leaps, shares, and 💎 🤚
Is this like an advertisement or some shit?  The lack of rocket emoji's concerns me.
Most of my positions are in GME, BB, ICLN, PLTR, and then there’s a few others which I’m not in as deep in. Last week I started using margin and it gave me roughly 1500 in margin to use. I noticed over the weekend that now I’m getting something saying I have an account deficit of 1500. I think the highest my account went to this week was 2200 and right now it’s around 1900. Can any of you shed some light here? 

It says I have to add 1500 from my account resolve the deficit and open new positions. I can do that I just don’t really get what caused this to happen when it was all good during the week.

If I get a margin call, can they automatically take control of my positions and sell whatever they want to resolve it? Or would I have a chance to sell positions myself or add funds?

If I ever do something so fantastic that I get a holiday named after me, please do not close the stock market on that day. That would be the exact opposite of what I wanted.
Dumb and dumber came out in 1994.

Gme has gained 19.94$ in a week.

RC is giving us all DD that it will be 199.4$ by Friday.

What tickers are open?
Damnnnnn bro!!!!! What an absolute sav, dude obviously has chops but kept it very tasteful and groovy 👌
My moves tomorrow? Uh...forced diamond hands because markets are closed
We’re not doing this to the stock, we’re playing the catalyst news and hoping the short squeeze happens. 

The run up last week we will find out was a combination of whales, shorts covering and institutions piling in. Then there’s us with our meager shares.
See my gme post below. Comment BUY or HOLD

Oh kk, I just meant that they are on the Canadian market so BB should be trading tomorrow.
retards and wsb
U cant be serious? “Someone has been accumulating large amounts of shares since x”. That isnt DD
It doesn't have to be all or nothing, You can have some side money to play the meme stocks. Personally, I think YOLO'ing is the single dumbest thing to do, you have to give yourself the opportunity to play another day if things go sideways.

Yeah you know what? I'm starting to lose trust in WSB and the moderators. They removed my post in which I'm just trying to protect new investors so they don't burn their hands on this GME play. If it was a post about GME and rockets they wouldn't have done anything about it. They're biased and possible in the play themselves.

Educate me
Because you are imagining two pools of money, those who have shares and those who need them. Shares get traded back and forth. You don't literally need everyone with shares to sell at one time to everyone who needs them in that exact moment. As the price rises and people collect profit, the available shares goes up. It rises again and repeats, each wave lets more get out, at massive losses.

That's literally all you **can** buy on margin.... you can't buy options on margin.
Not necessarily. Wouldn't do it with something like GME that has a decent chance of dropping heavily though. Because regardless of how you feel about the long term, if it drops enough then you will get margin called
Holding. Last I counted I only had 47 shares but I've bought more so many times it's getting hard to remember
Got me started listening to Cramer again.
I have no idea what you just said but i'm buying 10k on Tuesday
Nah, Gary V is a special type of retard. He's into Sports Cards. Like at least gamers have that silicon valley money and buy that weeb shit like candy, so you can scalp some money off them.
Just click buy shares. You won't be using any margin until your own balance is out so you're good

Within reason. You will only lose in proportion to how much the share price increases when your contract expires.

Anyone know when Porsche finally did issue shares, what the price was?
Couple of days ago it was said the mods were deleting GME posts and allowing BB to hide the GME posts. Dude, just let em do what they do. They do it well.

(Altough if I might give a suggestion, sometimes I'm curious why a post was removed. But that would probably be a lot of work added)
If it went to $420.69, I think DFV would somehow diamond hands it to a billion

Been sideways since July
GME opens at 44 closes at 169 🥜😤
Without any type of catalyst to force them to close their positions now they will just slowly close their positions and likely open new shorts to keep the price suppressed to minimize their losses.
Feel like the market will be volatile till Thursday and post inauguration. Maybe even next week

>All-Stock Offer

>With an all-stock merger, the number of shares covered by a call option is changed to adjust for the value of the buyout. The options on the bought-out company will change to options on the buyer stock at the same strike price, but for a different number of shares. Normally, one option is for 100 shares of the underlying stock. For example, company A buys company B, exchanging 1/2 share of A for each share of B. Options purchased on company B stock would change to options on company A, with 50 shares of stock delivered if the option is exercised.

They won't. Regardless what side you're on (I don't want this to become political or a debate about religion), the owners opinions are polarizing and they'd have to tone that down at minimum if they went public. But every time they're criticized the double down. Their success gave them a platform they won't give up. Same as Hobby Lobby.

Worked at Schwab for years. Not true. However...

1.) We did have people call and tell us they didn’t want their shares loaned out for short selling and we had to oblige even if they signed the hypothecation agreement (not sure if things are the same now as I left the company over 5 years ago) What if we all did this? 

2.) You can order out your shares in certificate form. Then they can’t loan them out. If you do this, you can still sell whenever you want. When you place your order it will ask you how you will deliver shares but you can still sell.

900 would be nice. Had to cool off last week. Time to get back at it.
It could also mean that the gains that may come from now on be peanuts
I know but I’m saying any reasonable 4th down going forward. Like 4th and 8 they pretty much have to go for it, if it’s anywhere near midfield. I would be going for it on 4th and shorter than 5 even in field goal range if I were the Browns.
Interesting information. Heres a well-constructed counter-point: did you know that I will get a massive boner if GME hits 200? Have you considered that? If not, take a moment to reassess.

Back when people didn’t take DFV seriously he was saying a bit above $10. Positive things have happened since then. But 35 is a lot more than 10, and he was reducing his exposure - didn’t replace the 100,000 shares of calls this week as far as I know. I suspect other value investors are also trimming or exiting. The gme board member’s fund also trimmed. And a lot of people here talking about digital distribution and other totally new business lines. That’s growth not value.

You are right Guys!  I should have specified that the ticker list is updated continuously when seeing new tickers in the reddit posts!

Sorry I’m fairly new to this. Why is everyone expecting GME to explode?
Lmao
Even if they are loaned out for a short position, it's unlikely you wouldnt be able to sell, since it would just force who ever is short to close the position immediately.

It's more likely that the broker-dealer would loan the shares out of their own reserve for short positions.
Or he is thinking that we are nuts for thinking there is a chance

I‘m sorry, really nice stuff you have there, but none of those things impede the market from crashing. The stock market has little to do (in short to mid term) with economic data. Right now, prices are kinda getting a bit high, with some industries beeing really overvalued right now. There will certainly will be a market correction with a ~40% hit. And it will probably  happen in the next 2-3 years or so. In german there is a nice saying which translates like „even trees don‘t grow into the sky“, which means that nothing is going up forever. The market is just more ahead of the economy than usually, which is going to be corrected someday, but don‘t fear it, trade it!

As can be read in their annual report:

> The market performance-based equity award consists of five tranches, each of 1 million market-condition RSUs that will become earned and vested in increments of 1 million RSUs when the 10-day average closing price of the Company’s common shares on the New York Stock Exchange reaches $16, $17, $18, $19 and $20, respectively. The grant date fair value and the derived service period for each of the market condition equity awards were determined through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model utilizing Level 2 inputs. Should the target price of an award be reached prior to the derived service date, the remaining unrecognized compensation cost for the award will be accelerated and recorded at that time. Any market-condition RSUs that have not been earned before November 3, 2023 will terminate on such date   
>  
> In the first quarter of fiscal 2019, the Board approved the 2019 Executive Chair Grant. As part of the agreement, the Company’s Executive Chair and CEO is entitled to receive a contingent performance-based cash award in the amount of **$90 million** that will become earned and payable should the 10-day average closing price of the Company’s common shares on the New York Stock Exchange reach $30 before November 3, 2023. As the award is triggered by the Company’s share price, it is considered stock-based compensation and accounted for as a share-based liability award. As at February 29, 2020, the liability recorded in association with this award is approximately $1 million

2. The market fearing Biden is going to engage lockdown 2.0.

3. It was Friday and they needed to make sure our calls would expire worthless.

4. The market always sells off ahead of a long weekend.

There is so much potencial!!!!! FUCKING BUY  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀
I’m already committed to holding long term, but my worry is that people get too overhyped with crazy expectations this week and get spooked if it doesn’t conform to their expectations. Some bear theory is nice to keep people grounded.
I think I might get some funds into that, nice decision.
He can trigger the short squeeze and then do a share offering @ $500 which will give the company enough cash pay off all debt and then some.

This is the way. You got any shares?
There's plenty if tards in wsb living really kick ass lives.
The only reason you should be doing that is if you don't obsessively watch the line all day and dont want to miss a potential squeeze. Set your dream number just in case. Though historically speaking squeezes are multi-day affairs.

There’s a reason Radio Shack closed down. The argument that GME is going to be the new Radio Shack/Build a Bear is retarded.

I mean, yes!
r/dividend is a boomer relic from when it would cost you $5 to trade some damn shares. So you bought shares that would pay you money just for holding them. Now it makes no sense to take that approach. Those who realize this and want to make money holding shares go to r/thetagang. Sell monthlies and weeklies to the autists here and collect steady money for sitting on shares.

oh this is coming from a PLTR bag holder lmao
> Wow that's one way to mispresent facts, damn that article.

Just look at the freaking chart. It's absoluted retarded to present this chart only from the start of 2020, so it looks absolutely insane and stupid how high the price is. We all know that the chart had its highs and lows before, but a normal reader of the article won't go on the internet and look that up. He'll just see the chart and think it's a bubble. Really misleading article in every single point.
Let’s fo chiefssss

They must have been alright comments.
If you ain’t buying more $GME at open based on 🥜 tweet, you hate money and you ain’t black.
perfect answer thanks
Twitter users will have no opposition, which is why they go on Twitter. There will be a billion comments like "exactly" and "that's the tea" and then they'll get bored that all the lawful evil people are gone.

They dont call it "like 4chan found a bloomberg terminal" for nothin
Kids, don't do drug please!
Just to pitch in on this, I heard recently a driving range in my local region got the licensing approval to use Toptracer technology at their facility. This is the technology owned by Topgolf. If they are doing this in my town they are probably looking to do this everywhere they can where a Topgolf facility might not be viable. So this could create a major influx of new untapped income on top of what they’re getting for the Topgolf facilities... 

I am not invested as I’m caught up on this GME shit but ELY will likely be my next play
Idk maybe uncertainty about new administration

What's the meaning of the peanut? 🤔🤔🤔
Well entry is important I called out the short literally at the top on my twitter lol the Friday before the big down day on Monday
I currently have nothing in GME (recent autist who jumped on BB). But dear god I dont give a fuk that tweet is like the second cuming of the savior - shifting boomer stocks to GME market open.
Do you expect a big red day?
Go to pennystocks sub they have OTC over there.

We are on the way up. Chance of squeeze is increasing. ALso the short interest is the literal highest its ever been with a return to profitability coming. Ryan cohen at the helm could send this flying, then adding he is going to buy 7% more shares omg...

The fundamentals on the sideline is because the majority of this sub is in for the squeeze, but the fundamentals with holiday sales are solid and improving.

AMZN likes to crush upcoming competitors. They where known to take their margins negative to fight CHEWY but couldnt compete with the service RC provided.

GME has never had ryan cohen.

And this is what boomers don't understand. They think movies and videogames/pc gaming is comparable. 

They don't undestand the hardware part of the deal is completely different, nor understand movies can be easily streamed and games are close to breaking the 200gb barrier. 

They also don't understand that is has "only" taken covid19 for big game franchises such as FIFA to beat physical sales for a first time in history this year. By a bare margin.

My conservative PT for GME after the RC tweet is $69,420.00

Now this is because RC tweeted an emoji of peanuts.

“Peanuts” has 7 letters so PT has to have 7 digits. So it’s $69,420.00 if RC included the .00 

But if he’s implying 7 digits excluding the decimals, the PT rises to a more reasonable $4,206,969
I think WSB should assign a historian that catalogs the greatest memes that tell the full story of what happens with each pick. I nominate bragghy.

**[Survivorship bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survivorship bias)**

Survivorship bias or survival bias is the logical error of concentrating on the people or things that made it past some selection process and overlooking those that did not, typically because of their lack of visibility. This can lead to some false conclusions in several different ways. It is a form of selection bias. Survivorship bias can lead to overly optimistic beliefs because failures are ignored, such as when companies that no longer exist are excluded from analyses of financial performance.

I had this happen to me in 2019.  I was wanting to buy Cineplex, a movie theatre chain.  A day before I pulled the trigger they announced they were being bought out at like double the share price.  But then Covid happened, the deal fell through, and the shares are in the toilet.  Not overly upset.
It's also worth considering timelines on these two. The DD I've seen has me believing GME should pop long before BB, which is a more mid-long term hold, so you could always convert your GME to BB later.

The guy who made millions off the mine the other guy quit on only did so because he called in an expert. Had the original man continued to drill he very likely could have continued to miss until completely underwater.

In simple terms, GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. It will hit ridiculous prices like 100$ a share or more
What are your BB calls? I got 2 contacts for 1/22
I’m in NYC, we have Microcenters, there is only 2 of them. In a city of 8 mil people there are hundreds of GameStop’s near me still open. Pretty good look for GME
Living in Virginia I’ve passed through and been in WV a few times and I gotta agree it’s super depressing looking. It looks like North Eastern Pa, old houses and stuff, but scattered with a ton of land in between.

Maybe there are a few okay cities in it, and maybe if you’re really into mountain nature with no cell service you enjoy it. But other than that, nah I’m good. 

I will say Snowshoe Winter Resort is pretty awesome though.

I think that’s what the comment meant. Since he has 13% now. Let’s fucking go!!!!
Absolutely. This is an amazing value buy, even if you don't necessarily believe in the 420.69 short squeeze pt. It's only gonna go up.
Look up “Tim and Eric totinos” on YouTube lol
Yeah bruh exactly I hate this shit, I swear as soon as I finally discover a good play the stock shoots up 20% before I even get in
Did exactly the same
Cool thank you. I think my confusion was that fidelity defaults to margin when I buy even though I have the cash to cover it in the account.
Shut up retard, buy more GME

A man of the people!
He closed his 20c 1/15 on Thursday pretty much at open.  He got rid of them all for ~$1.5m. The only times 20c 1/15 calls were that low on Thursday was between 9:45 and 10:30. At close Thursday they were worth $2m. At expiration on Friday they were worth ~$1.5m. There is a good chance him selling off those options Friday morning are what caused GME's drilling from 38 to 34 before it recovered to close ~$40. He is now ~33% cash gang.

He's got stock and April 12c left.

Our boi Marco:

"Why do they hate us? You tell me.

All we’ve ever done is starve and beg for a scrap!

[Brothers], they hate us because we shame them.

They hate us because they think we are weak, and they hurt us anyway!

We make them feel ashamed!

And men always gonya hate the thing that shame them.

But we can teach them to fear us… to hate us… to hate us because they fear us!

Because when you are weak, you can be surprising.

And when our day comes… when we surprise them in all their strength… on that day, they will fear us!

Because they believe we are weak, we have the power to be audacious!"
Gonna be a good week for us

I think futures will still be open tonight until about 1am for you degens who need your fix even though it’s a holiday tomorrow.
When you get stuck on the wrong side of the squeeze you can't just wait it out.. you can cover for a bad loss and still have ammunition or you can i suppose wait for your account to go into margin call and easily lose more than the entire account, why risk that?
Who said I wouldn’t have income?

This is a unique access point. But the up mass capability is very limited compared to other systems. It’s a good opportunity for the industry, sure, but you’re not going to see customers lining up out the door like that for SpaceX. Virgin falls into the same group of Rocket Lab and other small launch vehicle, which are just stating to get in the mix with government contracts. There’s more perks to those than this, though being separate from commercial tourism is the point I’m trying to make.
Why did you not average down? If you bought a 1000 shares at $4 bucks your price would have been $33.
My 50 blackberry shares gonna be worth thousands of dollars one day? Can’t see that.
DFV did months of good quality DD's on GME, now it jumps up and every single cunt is an expert rehashing the same tired crap as OMG DD to the point where this is now the GME subreddit.

lmao buying right at the top is almost impressive
There have probably been 100 posts about this already but tldr is yes, you personally can make profit but it's pointless to the overarching cause

When buying from a margin account, even if you don't use margin, the brokerage is allowed to lend out the stocks you bought. The point is that if daddy Cohen pulls a Porche and buys up a large portion of the floating shares with the help of us autists, the short squeeze will happen and we're headed to the moon but it won't work if the stocks we buy are not locked up because the gay bears can cover their shorts.

Then you're probably thinking, it doesn't matter, I only got 30 shares. Well, if even only quarter of the people on the subreddit had that much, we'd be headed to Pluto as we'd collective own over 25% of the estimated floating shares. But if everyone of them thought that their amount is insignificant and use a margin account, then it'll all be for naught.
Man fuck this market closed bullshit MLK didn’t die for this
a light 5%
Baba is free money
I'm already balls deep in GME since $28 so i won't buy more. If the squeeze happens, there's still some serious headroom for juicy short term gains, but I see BB as a more longer term play so I will just invest gradually every month into it

You are correct . WSB has more subscribers than barrons.
$1.40 in store credit won't matter when he got $1mil in the bank
fuck wheres zjz i need someone to bully
I don't see anything above $300, but that's just me. To me, I'll have more money than I've ever had in my life if it goes to $200, so that's absolutely fine with me and I absolutely won't kick myself even if it goes higher cause I'll still be happy.

Margin is dangerous because the losses are borne by the investor. At 1:1 margin, you’re accelerating gains or losses by 50%, but at 3:1 margin, you’re able to buy 4 times the shares you could without margin, so a 25% loss will instead wipe out your entire investment.

Example: Buy $4k of $30 stock with a $1k portfolio on 3:1 margin, stock drops to $22.5, you have lost everything. 

Stock dips to $25 instead, you still lost 2/3 of your $1k portfolio.
Inflation went down this year. I also searched this from statista, I didnt come up with this. its also average inflation because thats what matters from 2008.

They had a discount for digital nintendo games. Also this is a key growth area for ryan cohen to take the company.

Translation: gains so far are peanuts in comparison to potential gains, gif refers to the realization that there's a real chance for a squeeze

Yup. Buy calls
I wanted as many shares I could get an never knew this side of margin. I honestly don’t foresee this stock dropping down to my margin requirements so I’m just going to diamond these fuckers and sell at the top, hopefully. Or I’ll unload a fraction at the top to coder my margin. Question, if we sell back what the margin is, it would wipe out the margin correct?
Which is funnier considering maybe some of those shares were bought at rock bottom. Lending shares out can be more profitable than buying and holding.
It’s not
Thank you

This is my only fear because it's such an unique situation these guys might be willing to lose crazy money just not to make the headliones as the "idiots" who lost to the internet... obviously the board is never going to care and they would put a stop to it, but it might drag

That prob makes more sense. I was thinking of just going w non stop calls and selling puts on ARKX since I think it'll be worth 10x the price once the market matures, aka once starlink and delivery drones are common place.
1. Inflation at only 2.24%, with all this stimulus? I feel like that might be a little low. That could affect your target price.

2. Because I'm too lazy to look it up myself, how do you buy games digitally through gamestop? In my experience I can only do it through the Xbox/PSN/Nintendo stores.

3. Why would I go to GameStop to build my PC over Best Buy, where they have a whole computer department? Alternatively, could all the arguments for GameStop make Best Buy a buy? They've also been an outlier in retail.
Ehhhh. I lived in Chula Vista when my dad was in the navy I wouldn’t want to live there again.

The stock just doubled in 2 days. No one has any idea what the squeeze will look like. We may have just kicked it off, or that may have been it.

Why would you just arbitrarily sell at $200 if you believe you're in the MOASS. It could continue up to $500 at that point. Your strategy is actually more conservative and if enough people decide to follow it becomes self fulfilling and the price drops.

You're right, and that's probably why they are shitting their pants right now. Logic doesn't apply on most autists here, and such chaos must be very frightening to see when the market used those  methods that deal with rationality for decades. I feel we're getting into a new era where "retail" investors are getting more and more prominent, and for the moment they still can't embrace it and deal with it. Will probably take years to figure out how to handle that new outsider, if they can...
Interesting. Was that the 5.4m shares short from puts though? They had to disclose that directly.

Be careful of confirmation bias. I read the post mentioned and it made sense to me and it was a balanced post it was giving some useful insight into the situation. I did not get the impression it was a bear post from someone with ulterior interest. 

When you read DD like that carefully evaluate if the facts are correct and the reasoning make sense to you don't just complain that it opposed your viewpoint.
It's not like every minority voice is from a shill. 
Read evaluate and if you disagree write a comment and see what other say about it.

My whole strat right now is based around selling calls on stocks WSB is jerking off too. I’m looking at a 6.5% ROI on my BB stock just this week no matter what the fuck it does. I got a cool 3.5% on my PLTR last week. If I can keep my calls just a little bit out of the money each week the compound interest will get me a 400% return at the end of the year. I don’t even need or really want these stocks to 🚀. I just need WSB to keep jerking off to them.

Hot take
Options don't cause autism, people cause autism
Basically the Market maker has to hedge the options with shares. If the options are deep in the money the delta will be close to 1, which means for each 1$ change in price of GME, the option price moves by 1$, when the option is massively out of the money the delta is close to 0, meaning its pointless to have a hedge against something that has no chance of becoming in the money. So Originally when Melvin purchased the puts, the MM would have sold a good amount of shares to hedge it, but as it went up to out of the money, they would buy shares as the delta would be dropping to 0. By the time it hits zero, theyre fully out. A 15 strike put for July probably has a very low delta and the MM probably has only a small hedge against it. Maybe they sold 10 shares for every contract of 100 shares. So 54000 contracts would only equal 540,000 shares short.

It's disingenuous to only look at the Oct CF and project that for the future quarters. When looking at 9 months ended they've improved their operating cash flow from -654.8 million to -41 million. Assuming a strong Q4, they'll be CF positive.

I can see how it would be so easy for young, healthy, and talented people to fall into that trap.   They start quarantining back in March when we didn’t know what to expect and it was necessary, but then they got stuck in a social media and news echo chamber saying they could never go outside again.   No friends or activities to pull them back out of their shell and now it feels like it’s too late.   No memory of what their life used to be like
Really?
Okay, what about first mover advantage? How much is that? That's also the TAM right now. What about the long term growth rate? Are you assuming the market won't grow at all? Not to mention the conservative discount rate I'm using, the low multiple, cost efficiency? You don't think there's any cost savings as they expand their business? Sales and marketing cost is just going to go through the roof?

Sure, pick a single point, poke a few holes and say it's way unreasonable and say it's a bubble? 

When AAPL introduced the iphone back in 2007, its mc was just 100bn and folks were already saying it's overvalued as a phone company vs NOK, which was also around 100bn. What is AAPL mc now? What is NOK mc now?

I'm not going back. I've been pressured my whole life to be social, and seeing all my extroverted friends and family throw an absolute fit over having to stay home has given me the confidence I need to be myself. If they're so unhappy staying in then its ok for me to choose to stay in.
That’s fair. I should say that I only have a cursory understanding of what options *are*, but not at all how to effectively play them. My comment speaks to that—I suppose I mostly meant that minimal price movement doesn’t lend itself to the gutsy options WSB’s like to buy—one’s that make bold predictions and either expire worthless or print $$$. But even that could be wrong—I don’t mess with options because I don’t understand them.

And you should also factor in the cost if the premium per contract into your cost basis. The 1/21/22 22c is currently about $1000 per contract. So you'd be paying closer to $32 per share.

A benefit of exercising is that if you hold your option for 9 months and then exercise and hold the shares for 4 months, then you can pay long term capital gains taxes (which is about half of short term capital gains). You would also exercise if you want to own the shares

In my opinion, there's not a huge benefit to exercising options early. As soon as you do that, you'll be giving up whatever portion of the contract value is associated with the time remaining until expiry.

Are they separate accounts tho with different tax reporting? Or all under the umbof 1 account?

After reading all of the DD and especially this [DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kz7ygv/gme_dd_one_dd_to_rule_them_one_dd_to_find_them/) and what the proper pricing for $GME is supposed to be and the promise of having Cohen on the board, I'm longing $GME with a price target of $100+ conservatively by EoY. This (possibly infinity) squeeze is a bonus and I believe it's likely we achieve it, given the fact a large chunk of us is doubling down on Tuesday. 72 shares, adding $4k ($2k from VOO, $2k cash).

Damn, but the 10k on revolut are stuck in amazon shares and I'd have to sell that before, so I can't transfer that anywhere else
Diamond hands it. I was up 20k now only up 7k. I’m holding it period.
100 shares, 5 4/16 $25c
Don't calls help move the price up as well? I was looking at the Feb 19th 40C and the delta is .53. If I bought ten contracts for \~$6000, then wouldn't the market makers have to delta hedge by buying 500 shares or so? I'd only be able to buy \~200 shares with 6k. Is there something I am not understanding here?

It is certainly riskier and betting on a squeeze before mid-February.
Yes lol. How’d you know?

yeah I think so
It'll be weird. Some people don't want the world to go back to normal. And those that do, it won't feel very normal for a while.
Seriously thinking of getting a loan to buy more shares on Tuesday, is that retarded or actually retarded?
Mahomes threw that ball to the moon after the Td. Calls on Tuesday.

Yea cuz u can do a lot better such as selling less OTM or even just dividends would do better
probably just because of friday though right
It’s awesome. I’ve been ‘shirting’ members of our chat group. (Just type in ‘wallstreetbets shirt’ on Amazon, and there are a number of options:) )
Gotta love those posts. Funny words, but damn is it informative

To be fair I really believe in Gamestop and don't care if it squeezes into infinity for a brief moment or over a few months. But damn I would love to see it happen just for the memes and that feeling that we're making history, plus fucking those bastards that bet on the loss of thousands of jobs
Lmfao brilliant
That was way, waaaaay too easy
each call on TRLY gave me like $100/day last week
Absolutely. If you're holding anything that's not GME, you're leaving money on the table. Or, in this case, on Earth while the rest of it heads to the moon.

Awesome DD my fellow autist! The chinese are many.. and they have a lot of money to spend sooooo I added some 400 c 1/17/23 calls to my shares 🚀🚀🚀
I work in the industry so trust me. This system has been trying to get launched for years. Look it up. It originally started with Pegasus. This launch is a great milestone for Virgin but its usage is far different from anything that the other aero companies are pursuing.

This guy smoking Johnny Sins 🍆
Yes they are.... someone has to delta hedge against those calls and as long as he excersize a the calls it guarantees a better effect than shares due to the lower price of the call controlling more shares
One thing I don't understand about the squeeze is why aren't big players taking part? If it's such a sure thing and basically free money, why wouldn't some Bill Gates type just put down some fat stacks? This would basically result in an instant squeeze and they can make a bunch of money and get out regardless of if they want to invest in GME long term or not. You would think some big fish is gonna take part.

Can someone explain this?

Because it’s being pumped by WSB and twitter. Look at the front page of this sub.
Just took a shower a bitch wanna fuck 😩😫😫😫
Im in the same position. Its currently at its strongest bullcamp (between 126.50 and 127) where it tends to get bought up a lot. If that support breaks up next is 124-125 range. It is forming a cup and handle which is a bullish signal as well, however fundamentals always outweigh the technicals, so if the news is bearish against them, then there could be issues. I doubt that though because ive been seeing nothing but positives aside from the parler app bs. Im holding 136 & 137c 2/5s all the way. Could go up $20 between now and post earnings.

all you need to know for max tendies is in this clip.
oh me too, started at 18 now at 24
I think what is really happening is that most on here get options CALL options when they see it on here. There is usually some catalyst like seeing GME stores or downloads packed with people. So we all pile on Call options, what then happens is that Wall Street sells us those naked call options, and some on here even just buy the stock on market orders. I can see this by the charts. Then as Call options have huge demand the price goes up faster than the stock those people that sold those options are forced to now buy the stock which then ups the price. Which then people on here the late comers buy more of the stock and then it flips. Then comes in the catalyst that we all knew that video games are selling and then come the fundamental people piling on, then more calls to cover and so on. So in a way yeah we see in control here
All your 🥜 are belong to us.

Man I know CLDR broke out but I’m worried the market but be on some bullshit this week and I have so much expiring
It was more of a price rebalance and optimism of people genuinely buying the shares from the quarter earnings and our godsend RC joining the board
This place is kinda like those pens where they used to put retards in during the 60's.
I think it was just a regular weekend, but the stock only kind of mooned the next day. It was Tuesday that saw the batshit prices for some reason.
It's got good bones decent characters but the story is all over the place recently. I want to like it I really do but it's meh... watchable I guess
We don’t know what the current squeeze numbers are yet, comes out 1/27
Trading options is morally fair
Amzn to the moon!!!
Same, I’m thinking it’s a sign that the fuel nozzle is about to detach and lift off in t minus Tuesday
Organic long buying due to optimism. This isn’t the squeeze.
Virgin orbit launched a rocket off a virgin 747 just now. The rocket has reached orbit and is carrying a NASA satellite payload. The mission is still ongoing but looking very good right now. Technically speaking virgin orbit is a different entity from virgin galactic. However they still both belong to Virgin and Orbit does not trade. So the only way to get a piece right now is through SPCE. Think of it as the same as when space x launched last spring and tesla stock got a boost from the launch. Even though tesla has nothing to do with space x they had the Elon musk connection. Same thing should happen here and yes, SPCE also has a 35% short float. So if it does go on Tuesday think GME. Something similar could happen.
MS and nintendo are sided with GME your way to autistic for this sub because you cant even read the post your commenting on
Virgin orbit just had a successful launch so far, it's exciting for the industry as a whole. Get bent
Reeeee the top GME post from today
Have you looked at how the 2021 and 2023 bonds are trading? The 2023s are above par. If there was bankruptcy risk in 6-8 months, do you think the sophisticated as fuck bond markets would price them that way? Appreciate the analysis but this is too surface level.

Surprising silence on the GME yolo update.
Gamer wise? A lot of people have switched to PC gaming as of late, especially with the price of entry getting lower and lower. A lot of people would also rather go to a GameStop for something like this just due to the people in GameStop more often than not, actually knowing what the hell they are speaking about when it comes to games. The amount of stories I’ve heard from people going to places like target or Best Buy for gaming and computer question and being met with confused looks or misinformation. GameStop could pull in people in just knowledge and customer service alone.
What‘s their catalyst? They bought all water?

Buying calls was better a few weeks ago when IV and delta was low. The potential gamma explosion is lower now that its priced in. I think we all prefer a slow grind higher to a massive shortsqueeze, where some of us are going to be left bagholding.

At least 3.50.
It's a buy for sure. If you get shares it can't go tits up. Leaps are another safe option. Calls for 3 months out would be the best risk/reward for true autism.

Margin is basically debt to broker to get more shares. Basically longs dont buy shares only on margin lots of longs buy shares outright. Shares are very green while shorts are red so have less collateral.
Short squeeze will happen. It is just a matter of being patient and accumulating shares if you believe in gme
Lol no.

What was the last stock to have short interest similar to GME?
It's all about your personal risk tolerance.
I think it’s possible that it drops to 700’s before earnings as some profit taking happens, maybe even 600’s.

Lmao. This is the most autistic thing I’ve ever watched. Great job and fuck you.
Pick a cheap stock for practice.  Lets say the stock is at 5 Dollars.
Sell 3 Dollars strike and collect premium.   If it expires worthless, do it again.  If stock moves below 3 Dollars,  you get assigned 100 shares.  Once you get assigned 100 shares,  you sell 7 Dollars strike.   Keep doing it until stock goes past 7 and you shares gets called away.  and then repeast steps above

Ok, but in English for the slower autists?

AFAIK Delta is basically the margin you need to sell a contract? So as it gets closer to worthless (for the MM not the buyer) they can close out the position while only getting a hard fucking vs a complete thrashing? How does the SI line up with that theory?

so viruses are covered in these little spikes that make em able to interact with your cells, yeah? And these same spikes are the things your immune system recognizes them by, 'oh look it's that fucker with the spike that's shaped like a bad dragon dildo that the vaccine warned us about, fuck him up boys' says your immune system as it sends out its legions to wreck an infection.

And so there's a mutation on one of these fuckers that changed the shape of one of these spikes so now the fucker can attach itself to your fucking cells better. Throw a few other mutations in there cause viruses are constantly mutating, and your immune system goes 'who the fuck is this don't know him' instead. This is some bad shit and it's not hypothetical these mutations already happened. If they spread then we've got a covid virus that's better at fucking you up and the vaccine won't have warned your body about it right so it won't know wtf is going on

I got my mom on GME when it was ~$13, she had 3k shares or so, she sold at ~$14.5 smh
Not saying the bubble will burst anytime soon, but I definitely struggle with some of these conclusions.

1. GDP is a fundamentally flawed metric for economic health; 10 billionaires (or the S&P 500s growth this year) can outweigh the relative impacts of a recession.

2. Unemployment numbers are about as accurate as election polls in 2016. The BLS surveys 60,000 recently unemployed families every month. Given the 10s of millions of layoffs and unemployment’s in Q1, how statistically accurate do you think those surveys are currently?

3. Job openings are not the same as hiring. It also doesn’t account for permanent redundancies - unemployment or not, few companies are going to make it through 2021 “increasing” headcount even relative to late 2020 baseline. I might lay off 10K people, and hire 5K. There’s still 5K fewer jobs than before.

5. Rent prices rising is not necessarily good for the economy, it’s not necessarily even good for land lords. It’s a sign of rising cost of living, property taxes, expenses... raising rent to cover expenses doesn’t necessarily imply greater profits and certainly implies a tighter budget on Main Street.

The rest, eh, fuck it. 🚀

Do any brokers offer the ability to parse your portfolio into multiple, not sure what to call it, sections?

Essentially treating them as separate accounts, with separate balances, but all held under one account from a legal/tax perspective? Would help realize how much money I'm making off boomer shit vs how much I'm losing on retarded shit.

"On October 26, 2008, the company had informed Porsche that it had increased its stake in VW from 35% to 42.6% and that it had secured a further 31.5% via options, giving it a total stake of 74.1% when the options were fully exercised. However, speculators, in particular hedge funds, had bet on falling prices and sold VW ordinary shares short. Since the state of Lower Saxony held another 20% of VW shares, less than 6% of VW shares remained freely tradable. The short sellers had borrowed 12% of VW shares, which they had to buy on the stock market to repay the loan. Thus, they were in a short squeeze."

While it may be logical to believe any negative post about GME is a conspiracy from the man trying to hold you down, seeing as there is a massive short interest, wouldn’t it be logical that there are just regular-ass people who are bearish about this stock and make a post about it?

No, it was because Porshe announced they owned 70% of the shares, so shorts were fucked because it meant another company took control and VW wasn't going to go bankrupt.

So when VW announced they had bought 70% shorts were basically stomping over each other to get out and cover their shorts.

And they had to do it with Less than 30% of shares. The squeeze stopped when Porshe gave them an out

What's a good play for Tuesday?
The sufficient amount of money you need to do options is what they cost. You could buy a call on something like Ford for about 5 cents per share, or, real cost about 5 bucks per contract. Meanwhile, a Jan 22 825 call on Tesla will cost 2825 for a single contract. 

So it depends on what options you want to buy. 

I’d recommend you do tons more research.

Of course this is all just math based on statistics and it's important to realize that it's not the statistics that drive stock prices, but stock prices that drive statistics.

For anyone not aware, we're approaching the point in the timeline where Porsche announced they secretly acquired 75% of VW.


They announced on a Sunday afternoon when markets were closed to force a frenzy the next day, which led to the short squeeze. This could be the precursor to tomorrow's big announcement when markets are closed.

there is 0 requirement to hold your shares for 500 years. You can sell them when you see green
Just pitching in. I play ELY earnings all the time. They’re a solid company and an easy way to make anywhere from 50%-150% on calls. Sell before earnings if you got em paper hands. If you’re a true retard like me, diamond hand this bitch.

Hedging only sounds smart. It isn't really. Almost never. If you are buying two things instead of one, you are likely wasting money and making your outcomes more complex than they need to be.

Invest what you find acceptable to lose based on relative volatility and have an exit plan you know you'll stick with.

Retrace to 7 is what I’m holding hope for. Then going all in long/leaps. Hopefully GME shoots it’s load by then.

I know BB is way undervalued for a cyber security/software company, especially if they've got ties to tesla and Amazon. I see that ballooning very soon. 

And TLRY is merging with another company in Q2 this year, I expect biden to and majority Dems to push through federal legalization of marijuana, so I think that will see gains as well. Maybe not as sharp as some would like. But definitely gains over the next year or so. Maybe spiking whenever the merger goes through and stocks are transfered over to TLRY and also whenever the rumbling of legalization starts

I believe the reason Ryan Cohen tweeted a peanut followed by the D&D movie meme is because he sees hows "nuts" it is right now and recognizes how plausible the short squeeze is. I think he may buy more shares on Tuesday to increase his stake.

**[Standard deviation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard deviation)**

In statistics, the standard deviation is a measure of the amount of variation or dispersion of a set of values. A low standard deviation indicates that the values tend to be close to the mean (also called the expected value) of the set, while a high standard deviation indicates that the values are spread out over a wider range. Standard deviation may be abbreviated SD, and is most commonly represented in mathematical texts and equations by the lower case Greek letter sigma σ, for the population standard deviation, or the Latin letter s, for the sample standard deviation.(For other uses of the symbol σ in science and mathematics, see Sigma § Science and mathematics.) The standard deviation of a random variable, sample, statistical population, data set, or probability distribution is the square root of its variance. It is algebraically simpler, though in practice less robust, than the average absolute deviation.

So you have made a bet that the stock price will be a minimum of $49 per share on the 22nd, some boomer has took you up on that bet and you think it’s going to actually be more than that so if it’s $100 per share some retard has agreed by contract that they will sell you 400 shares at $49 per piece, if it goes over $49 this boomer will still need to honour it and you will make the difference in profit? So if it goes to $50 you make $400, $1 dollar on all the shares? If it goes to the fucking moon 🚀 and is worth $100 you make $51 profit per share x 400 yeah?

On the opposite hand, what happens if it doesn’t land that quick? What happens if the share price on that day is $40? You need to fork up the 9x400= $3600 deficit to purchase those shares?
Papa JPow at the end kills me
I’m on both. The wsb warmachine has battles on different fronts.

As member of $GME Gang every weekend feels like the day before Christmas 35 years ago. And now Santa makes an early appearance 🎁🥜
Variance of period x/ Square root of nr of trading days in period x.  
In the above example, I took the IV for 1/21/2022 options:

* 122% / SQRT(252) = 7.7% (corrected math in above post)

According to finviz the weekly and monthly volatility figures are 31.46 and 14.74.

* 31.46 / SQRT(5)=14.1%
* 14.74/SQRT(21)=3.2%

What's this got to do with standard deviation? Well, it all relies on some math and the expectation is that price follow a normal distribution (in reality they never do, but that's another topic) and hence in roughly 68% of the time, the stay within one STDEV, 95% time within two STDEV and 99% of the time within 3 STDEV.

For the above, a 2 standard deviation move would be 28.1% (based on the weekly volatility). Normally you take the annual IV but I'm still new to this so I'm open to be be corrected.

Well this certainly makes me feel better about my 1/21/22 $15c
I think it's like 17 bucks
Should I sell my 300 shares of pltr at a loss on Tuesday and just buy more gme?
Heater
This is the way.

Edit: if you don't mind what strikes did you get?
SPCE 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Tuesday will be epic for GME.  🥜🥜🥜 emoji will probably now replace 🚀🚀🚀emoji lol
True that. However, we would be shareholders not customers
Nobody doing that.

Now if you want to talk corn or peanut fututres, this is the place
Bring back commissions to crush theta gang!
You retards are so close to convincing me to buy GME shares. Fuck you all
Please dont sell if things are "slow" this week. A lot of speculation saying tuesday may not be our day. Plus id like to up my position so why not let the tendies sizzle a while longer. I like mine extra crispy. Better for all the cohen sauce to stick on. A spicy aolio if you well. Spicy enough to fuse melvins asshole entirely shit while we stuff his face w our 💎🍆. Yours truly- an autist.
People who think that it was retail buying behind that 100m+ volume on Friday are idiots. MM's holding the price down and they're loading up. Severely undervalued. I YOLO'd into it for 30k shares and added another 30k on margin. We're going to the fucking moon tits!
Still the same parent company. It's just subdivisions of unmanned payloads vs a manned commercial launch.

I think SPCE stock will react positively to this.
Yikes
then buy back in lower for the long thesis
[removed]
Nice try Melvin
Thanks guys im fucking retarded
[removed]
aint happening lol
Retirement should be wary for what? That they should buy this stock? Confused by this statement...
wHaT ?
You guys are just arbitrarily picking round numbers to decide what constitutes a squeeze. No one can predict things to this degree especially because the attempt to predict will change the behavior of the stock as people anticipate.

I'm really not entirely confident in anything personally but at each new big end of day peak I'm setting a stop loss about 20% down and not readjusting downwards. If my current stop hits, fine. I'll sell and still be up 120%. 

Then I can reassess. If it shoots up to $50 my stop will now be around $40. And so on. 

Predetermining a number can burn you badly and make you too stubborn.
SPCE just had successful flight.
Pretty sure that'd be over the line w the sec
I’m a broke college student trying to make 🚀🚀🚀 or whatever that means. $500 into GME at opening a risky but relatively safe bet?
sold 30 15$ 3/19 @qb puts. break even price is 5.8. it was around 195 IV too
All in on GME shares. This is the way.
I am taking the chiefs and the saints but I hope the Browns put up a good fight
[removed]
Yeah but who wants to trust their money with a firm that burns a billion in capital on underwater positions? If the price goes up it only gets worse for them and they have to eventually close these positions. While they won't just get shoved out of their position like a retail short it's going to be death from a thousand cuts if the pressure keeps up. Imagine if next week plays out with just a small percentage gain or even neutral, their positions will still be just as underwater but they'll have had to pay another week's worth of interest on their shorts. The tide is really against them without a significant catalyst to drive the price down, which is what all the negative articles and downgrades are trying to accomplish. It's why holding is so critical, just holding means we win.
Not tied to SPCE, but looks as if Virgin Orbit launch was successful.  Hoping for some SPCE ignorance push.
Is he realising the 7%?

Porsche announced takeover (75% purchased already via warrants I believe it was)
It’s drowning in debt and has pretty much no cash left. Last I heard they’re trying to sell their head office
Thanks Homie!
I can only buy shares on my app. That is what I did!!! 💎💎💎🤚🤚🤚🤚
Brokerages forced them to close as they didn’t want to take additional risk. That made the price go up from the covering and it snowballed
I don’t think so

I believe they are a part of RC Ventures LLC which the shares were purchased under, so it’s just one entity between the three of them

Could be wrong tho and maybe they can personally hold shares without filing
Maybe it's because I work in hardware security myself, but I'm legit surprised people can read all the latest offerings and still think they're a dead company

granted it's not gonna be instant growth but long term prospects look real solid

Fees/fines to the institution and overtime would end up costing more than just taking the loss
Partnerships with Apple (via Hyundai) and Amazon as well as winning a lawsuit against Facebook. Blackberry's technology will be HEAVILY involved in EV software going forward. Even without all that news - $9 per share puts them at 1/20th the share price of Crowdstrike with a similar annual earnings estimate for 2021.

$20 per share will still be cheap.
Blackberry will easily be worth over $100 per share by 2023.
Shit I told everyone, I put in 3k best friend put in 2k, parents just put in 4k... We going to the moon!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

How is this going to moon? That drop from 2016/2017 is massive.
I must be a full retard because I still don’t understand. If GME goes to the moon will I not profit off the shares I bought on RH? I guess I have margin shares because they were bought with Instant Deposit, but I don’t have a RH Gold account which allegedly gives you access to margin investing. 

Someone please ELI5 to my smooth brain on what the hell kind of account I have with RH and how that fucks up my chances at making a profit with the rest of you retards.
So basically I gotta buy dhares until wednesday and just sell at peak

I would be looking at afterhours first on Monday, then I would think about buying them, proably would buy a bit more out of the money too tho
If you want to multiply the effect of gains, you should just use options, you invest about 1/10th what you normally would, with the expectation it could go to 0, costing you what a 10% drop would normally.
No, Papa Cohen is in Control.

I agree 100%. I'm up bigly on my 2023 deep ITM leap. I will add more if we fall below 225 (though, I think it's unlikely). This literally cannot go tits up. I bought my leap when it hit 216 and I will never lose money on this deal.

Another essay about never trying to trade shares. Sorry it didn't work out for you, but as a thought experiment: Had you just bought the same value in shares, where would you be right now? It's OK to realize that options are too volatile emotionally, I feel the same way. Shares give you the breathing room to wait out a bad week.

I have some 1/29 calls that were up massive on Friday morning and now barely green. 🤞🏻🤞🏻
Yes I love this, I hope he makes the shorts bleed slowly. Each cut deeper than the last as the price keeps rising consistently. Which will also give new shorts more time to say “it’s at $100 now!? It’s for sure going down from here, I’m going to short it like crazy!”

And then we add them to the list of retards that we keep taking money from on our ascent to $200, $300, $500, Valhalla...🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Form 3 is filed AFTER the purchase, it's entirely possible he's already exercised the buy on Friday and will report on Tuesday. We can only hope that coincides with an announcement of him taking the crown as well.
Yeah that would be fucking insane
Because idiots think Tesla and all other new EV companies will take 250% market share of the car market.

In poker, the nuts are the best cards in the round.
Me too ☄️
No problem. In all seriousness though I'd wait 30 mins or so after market open in case we get another day like Friday.

UNLESS, there's some big news then by that shit quick. 

I've been averaging up this week but I bought on all of the peaks and not the dips. 

Good luck and join GME gang!
I’m buying shares in my IRA because I hate paying taxes on 🚀🚀
Melvin is worth about ~19B and apparently sits on ~40% cash, so without liquidating other positions, we can eat up 7-9 billion before they will be forced to liquidate positions and cover. If they do hold out that long, they will go bankrupt/lose all their clients
So SPCE gonna fly again after all
Never go full retard

even if your finance career goes nowhere you can work with retards in HR and make 50k-60k a year to actually survive
This is also a positive catalyst. CCP assumes ownership of his shares and we get more government tendies
I've got 100 shares and will add more Tuesday. Man wouldn't that be some shit if everyone here averaged 8 shares

This is the way.
I had BABA and held over a year. Stock did not move much the entire time despite rise in yoy revenue. Finally sold once it reached 205. Went back up past 300 bought in on what I thought was a dip at 270 but kept dipping. For whatever reason BABA does not gain alot of traction even with no negative news. Still holding shares.
I dont want to make you all change your underwear but, we are like +75% since ryans last tweet about the roller coaster. Cary on

Same - I bought $1,000 worth of BB calls when it was at 8.10. Woke up the next morning to a 100% return. Didn't sell a single contract. I am 💎🙌 that shit until it's either worth $10,000 or 0.
Actually Tesla were my first but they weren’t free lol, but this is my first decent gain from options
Can’t even spell the first word correctly? “Thus” is disappointing. I know you don’t give a shit but it’s off-putting when you don’t care enough to check grammar.

 They offered him peanuts to sell them shares to cover. 

So youre saying theres a chance.
I really don't see this working. I used to work for a brokerage house and this never stopped us from lending shares out. I know there are articles on the web that discuss this but I don't think it's true.
Thanks nastynate I needed that.
He hasnt bought his extra 7% yet, we're all hoping he does this week
the puts expiring have nothing to do with shorted shares. Anyone covering Tuesday would be due to a margin call after the price jumped last week or institutional traders deciding to cut their losses.
Just learn math and coding to give you the edge.
I like bb pumping on the weekend. Gonna be good workhorse
you should go for it, WSB DD has never failed once, I'd recommend utilizing margin too while your at it.

this weekend I've been like "well if I see a really good DD or some good news I'll buy more shares", just for one tweet to end up being my catalyst. With his pseudo-acknowledgement of us/the situation this has gotta be good

I need to do puts.  I rode shares from $115 - $180 and sold when they announced the offering...should've rolled it right into puts.
I'm not gonna lie I still don't understand why I shouldn't buy shorts on margin. Are you just afraid of the risk of getting margin called during a dip and the shares getting liquidated and becoming available to shorts?

true DD
First rebuttal, Twitch is that game spot that you describe.  Game spot will not dethrone twitch.

Second, your short squeeze thesis is predicated on a long run way. Should GME continue to burn cash (-184M operating cash flow in October 2020) it has a 6-9 month runway.  Should they post further huge operating cash flow losses, it supports the short position.

GME needs to do a shelve offering but who is gonna invest in it a bad business model with 1B in debt and very low margins going forward.

Basically both our thesis are predicated on time. Should they raise more cash, short squeeze is more likely.

If they can't, default within 8 months.  

Place your bets everyone.

China's securities regulator approves trading of peanut futures
Xinhua | Updated: 2021-01-17 08:46

Trading of the peanut futures will be launched on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange starting Feb 1. [Photo/Sipa]
BEIJING - The China Securities Regulatory Commission (CSRC) has given the green light to the trading of peanut futures, an important oil crop.

Trading of the peanut futures will be launched on the Zhengzhou Commodity Exchange starting Feb 1, according to a statement on the CSRC's official website.

Trading of the peanut futures will help provide relevant farmers and enterprises with open, consistent and transparent price signals and effective risk-management tools, and will boost the steady and sound operation of the sector, according to the statement.

The CSRC will ask the exchange to make all the necessary preparations to ensure the steady operation of the trading.
The sudden nature of the Porsche's announcement scared the fuck out of everyone. The consolidation of the holders in that squeeze meant that if they waited. Prices would literally go up infintely. The situation was in a much stronger stranglehold and hence the risk for a margin call on the shorts was much higher. Two pairs of pants were soiled the day Porsche announced their 99% of float: 1. the shorts 2. but also their brokers.
lol sorry i meant tomorrow.

Flip it around. If you're a big HF player and you see your competitor use sneaky methods, wouldn't you press their throats too?

Is it fine to buy GME with as much cash as I have in the account and still buy some on margin or just stay away from buying this with margin all together?

There were days where GME was up 25% and you guys ruined it to just 15%.

you should be fine. amount of hustle you need to get a good job largely depends on your school and regional area
She's shares get your sharessss
Why can’t we have both
Take that 5k and day trade SPY instead. If you don't have 25,000 to get around the day trading rule of 3 in 5 days, you can still do two a week, three max, while you wait for the old day trades to drop off. You can get 5% of your 5,000 two to three times per week just riding SPY up and down.
Fingers crossed

It’s not as much as a competition or market saturation as we’d typically assume. Most streaming services have unique shows that brings a variety of customers that don’t compete with one another. 

Instead these steaming services are in direct competition with standard binary television (like cable/satellite) and the movie industry/theaters.

So the battle for the next few years will be between streaming and tv cable/ old school movie productions/theaters.

This is why we now see hbo/Disney/etc going to direct streaming. Not as much as a competition against other steaming services vs steaming services...but going against steaming services vs the old industry standard..aka hbo/dis are adjusting to steaming from a direct competition against their movie theatre/cable/etc vs steaming and NOT their steaming against steaming..they are aligning with steaming as steaming instead of losing against them as the old industry standard..a subtle difference but an important one to understand.


Some of what I said was repetitive but it was to drive in the point and distinguish between the two.
super random but any of you live in LA, especially Westside? how is it to live there?

GME BoD members not up for reelection sold their shares, plus holiday weekend sell off more likely the reason for Friday dip. I think most people long on margin are on more customer friendly brokers, idk I'm on RH/TW and am chilling w/ margin, but I'll probably cash out see options and other plays to actually own my margin shares. Great DD, the GME DD has been slacking lately or redundant.
Yah Ik bro thats why its a meme. I would 100% not recommend it, especially next week  lol. Although I would do long calls vs shares IMO

Ecnomist who works for a bank here. GDP is "fine" for certain definitions of fine. However, we are not looking at a stock market crash, but a correction. There are periods of time where the stock market rises considerably faster than gdp, which is the case recently. This has largely caused by increased liquidity due to monetary policy (JPOW money printer go BRR). Small corrections will occur as they did a few times last year, but until there is a fundamental shift in monetary policy or a black swan event (God forbid civil war), we won't see a crash. 

A lot of indicators I am looking at suggest a 5-10% pullback this quarter and then bull market continuation.

Thanks, but do you have a source for this? SEC Form 13D/A filled 1/11/2021 (and 8K) places a standstill period which doesn’t allow RC Ventures to acquire more than 19.9%. That states that RC Ventures can acquire more they simply have to wait. If they get 20% or > than they trigger some restrictions and perhaps trigger a business combination with RC Ventures (GME+RCV).
I’m a broke college student. $500 into GME Tuesday morning??

There are some legit smart people here but the majority of us are dumb as fuck retards who have no right giving financial advice to people. Most of us that are yoloing and saying fuck it, and putting our life savings on the line are lying (at least I hope) or young college kids/young working adults with little to no financial responsibilities. 

So dump what you feel is right, as in, if worst case scenario and the gay bears somehow (really unlikely) wins, you're ok with basically losing it all. Also, we don't want no paper hands.

But remember, STONKS ONLY GO UP🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

FWIW I went thru your comment history and I think I'm gonna buy $KTOS 1/23 $35c on Tuesday
100 shares and 💎👐
All I know is I bought in at the peak and have held ever since. Hopefully this will redeem my autism slightly

Probably? The rest of the world consumes our music, movies, fashion, politics, and news...makes sense they would celebrate our holidays too
In short:


🌈🧸 relies on retail investors being 📄✋ for their market manipulations to work.


A growing number of retail investors are 💎🙌 and buying the dip.


Ask the Tesla shorts how relying on 📄✋ retail investors worked out.
Isn't the standard norm of this place 100%?
I believe they’re only authorized to buy back $100 million worth of shares which would only be like 2.8 million shares (~4% of total) if they buy at last closing price of $35.50

Could happen, wouldn’t be ideal for us but I don’t think that’s ideal for them either so perhaps unlikely.
4000+ 🧐

I just like making money. Bears are cast as people who think this stock is going bankrupt. It’s not. Bulls are cast as people who think this stock is legit worth $420.69. I’m in between. I think it’s worth $20 until Cohen delivers the goods above expectations. But I’m a bear this week because I think value investors will dump and this sub is near peak emotional engagement. I’m buying hand over fist this week if under 25 because the dealer unwind of short would be potent Friday (buying) at that price.

I hope futures rip up so I can cover my losses occurred on Friday
I have no idea what any of this means, but I’m interested
This.
I mean I made some good money on TSLA the last run. When it's on its pretty much free money. So fucking easy to scalp too.
I have no idea what other ppl actually do when using big investment as collateral. If i was in that scenario i suppose id try to get the loan with an institution that would set up receiving the dividends and paying the loan interest being taken care of for me then maybe sent to another account so whatever is in my second account is actually mine to spend. (Dividend income - loan interest)
This guy gets it

Makes sense. Everyone I've talked to who went big four has been miserable. They spend 3-4 years working 80 hour weeks, and then hope they get a management position that'll let them leave.

Sorry your lord and savior didn't get the nomination. But jesus, come back to reality a bit. WallStreetBets isn't the place to fight tooth and nail about identity politics.

That´s about right. You like it ?
We want the shorts to get squeezed. The shorts will have to buy shares to cover their positions, and only if you buy shares you will help to squeeze the shorts (they will have less shares available to cover the positions, yeeting the price up). Also we don't know when the squeeze comes, better to have shares (no expirations) rather than calls (can expire worthless).

i’m reading this while taking a shit and i still don’t understand why i shouldn’t buy on margin. i’ve used up my $1000 and don’t plan on using more, but i think that’s sitting with $pltr. why no margin?
Nobody needs a middleman in digital gaming. GME wont exist in 15 years.
Thx
They must hate money.
I really thought I was smart until I came here and tried to understand this shit. Your brains are huge and I need a college course to decode this. I do however understand 🚀 the rest not so much. I’m in regardless.
It wasn't the worst bet to short gamestop from 2013 to late 2020. The board wasn't adapting to emerging markets. Balance sheets indicated a slow and steady demise over the years. However, Cohen's involvement changed everything, and they should have saw it coming, but they were too deep in their thesis. They also didn't foresee the incredible power of us autists. As far as I know, never before has their been such a unifying presence for individual investors. Big MM's could do what they wanted and get mostly positive outcomes, particularly in regards to being bearish. WSB has become an institutional of longs and bulls that has serious power (wsb collectively owns upwards of 5% of the company). Thats puts wsb within the top 5 largest investors for gme i believe.

This doesn't mean that we have the power to do anything we want. Collectively it's significant, but clearly wsb can't all buy a given stock and pump it up 20% in a day, but holding for the long term is significant, and its more significant when held against a large collective of short sellers. If wsb can reduce float and continue to grow in equity for a shorted stock, we become stronger than big hedge firms like Melvin Capital. That is, it is far stronger to buy and hold against a shorted stock than it is for the MMs to short the stock and bring it down. Perhaps wsb's collective investment goals really should be to go after heavily shorted stock because our mantra really is to buy and diamond hand because we're retarded. We could, over time, literally change the business strategies of hedge firms and cause them to not use their big money to manipulate stock through shorts, at least not to the extent they use it now

I just had another thought to add. WSB has family and friends network, not just the 1.9mm members. I alone own 6000 shares but I also got 3 friends, my father and brother to buy (1000 more share maybe in total).
Youre hired
What is the case for Melvin to start covering? GME could not possibly exceed their free capital?
😉
You're going to get crunched when you're near close out and PLTR is still fucking around in the mid-20's.

Biden is that u?

I'm a simple man. I see an idiot saying "short squeeze" on everything now, I downvote. 

Prob didn't even know the term prior to a week ago.
Shame you didn't try to get 4.20 shares
I like your optimism and also the fact you censor his name is hilarious that there’s bots that just downvote the bad bad bad guy that’s saving thousands of small businesses
I see where you’re going...but the caption kinda goes against that.
Thank you sir for your service to mankind.
Thanks bro
Stonks go up?
you can definitley make money buts its risky. also in this case it doesnt help with the squeeze.

Not everything is zero sum. But the bear case has more to do with democrats more likely to sanction big business (which includes big tech) while lately republicans have largely tried to deregulate/stay out of business affairs.

What is the 19th letter of the alphabet?
S.
You replace T with S in peanut?

Ryan Cohen is literally telling me that if I buy more $GME, my wife’s boyfriend will let her touch my Peanus.

People talk up the ~140% of float but that is assuming all 140% is called home at once which isn't accurate, it's spread all over the calendar.

HOWEVER, 51,000 contracts did supposedly expire $15+ underwater on Friday. If that's accurate, that means there should be a six day period for those shorts to cover 5,100,000 shares -- and these fuckers are so short they're wearing goddamn Daisy Dukes.

I mean that's probably true but shares don't expire so if its a waiting game they want to play then at worst we can slowly bleed them dry.
I also feel like people psyched about this company have never visited its website or made an order

You're new so I'ma explain this clearly: stocks don't go on face ripping Rally's straight fucking up forever (other than tesla). Will it go up over time? Uh fuck yes it's a great growth stock. Do you need to let it breath for 5 min? Also yes.

Is apha undervalued vs merger arbitrage? Fuck yes. Is the more likely play that apha comes up to meet it? No. After this face ripper the more likely is tlry comes down to apha. Either way, you're safer in apha than tlry but don't think you found the magic answer.

How do you put GME shares in a wallet
At this point, I think like at least a third of this sub is playing GME, if not even movre. Some maybe just with 1 share to be a part of it.
Probably want to get all the way to SPY 325.00ish to find new buyers to get to $400.00
AND HOLD ONTO EM 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I should’ve accepted my Harvard instead and been dating Malia.... could’ve been celebrating My mother in laws birthday today (Michelle Obama).... oh well 

Calls on TSLA
What does it mean to use margin? Does that mean borrowing money from a lender to buy shares?
Just to add to it,

Shares short went UP over last 2 trading days;

Last known borrow fee rate was 31.24%. I have never seen a borrow rate that high. 

I thought I missed the squeeze, but yea, this is just getting started.
Short shares are still pretty high if memory serves. If there are still a ton remaining to cover, it could absolutely continue mooning.
Since August
Whats your entry price? May join you on Tuesday
I was with you right up to the buying calls could be bad part. Buying calls would cause a Gamma squeeze on top of the short squeeze.

Also, I don’t think the squeeze will happen next week either. Although I do believe we will trend upwards towards high 30s again.

Great DD !! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
why? did anything happen?
What?
What if cohens tweet is about PLTR?
🥜=planters maybe 🥜=PLTR
Ok ask yourself these 2 things ( I don't need to know the answer, but keep it in mind )
1. Are you given time back after tax season to make up for the long days/weeks during tax time?
2. When calculating your salary breakdown per hour,  accounting for effective overtime you would incur during tax time, is that an hourly rate you're proud of?

Only saying this because my college roommate went this route and keeps telling himself "next year will be better" and so far that hasn't ever been true.
Where can i buy wsb ?
That's fair. Seems like he's just looking out for your best interest but I can't help but laugh at the shit boomers fall for

One of their acquisitions, Cylance, has 2x the market cap of BB.

That's just ONE of their many acquisitions.

BB to at least 20 EOY
Honestly who knows for certain, but I feel that people underestimate how long short sellers can hold out or how dirty they are willing to play. They stand to lose incredible amounts of money, and people commit murder for FAR less. Don't think that they won't do everything in their power to prevent this if they think they can get away with it.

I can't watch the trading live, so I'll take what I can get. Plus I don't have a huge stake in GME, so it won't matter much
a peanut emoji is going to be the catalyst to this history making squeeze.  Ill take it haha
How did you do that!!?!
ats not exactly how it works. If you have a deep ITM option when you exercise the option you buy 100 shares per 1 option at the strike price and then you can immediately dump it on open. 
So you have 100 call PLTR with an expiry at 1.9.2022 with a 22$ strike if palantir trades at 50 by then you could buy 10,000 shares with the leaps for 22$ even though market price is 50$. ( if you have the money of course )

Nah, we would probably end up back around $20-30 and we can buy back in there.

So guys heres my strategy. All in GME, rake in profits. Use profits from GME to all in BB. Am i playing the game right?
Melvin isn't a bunch of innocent younglings though...
When peanuts were first introduced to North America in the 1800s they were difficult to grow and regarded as poor food. Then BOOM peanut butter. 

GME is gonna be peanut butter.

Thanks, my bad
I thought you were right then I did a little calculation. I got 150 to 200k in options at all time, sub gotta have 20,000 people with same assetts minimum, not counting mf's like deepvalue, thats 4 billion dollars just those 20,000 people. Subs gotta 1.2 million others with 5$ to 20k$

This is the reason I won't buy in. I've been wrong so far and should have but I'm majorly concerned that WSB only has like 15% of the shares.
No but the weekend Dow is up🥴
Anything but GME is peanuts.
can someone explain why I shouldn't use margin to buy GME shares? I'm 50% holding with margin on my gme shares

Is RC’s cryptic tweet about a chance at a short squeeze 🥜
That's very true. I just wonder how many people are going to get into this, if possible, on the short side since you can take both sides in these games. I mean if I were a smart gambling man I would buy call spreads and then hedge with shorts. Always making money. :)
What is on Tuesday?

no prob man. this kind of trade should work on in your favor most of the time but a single full limit loss would wipe out 19 prior max profits

Yea a good teaching moment at the very least. I did close to the same. The investigating that I did was evidence enough of an undervalued, misunderstood company and I didn’t want to miss out, for which I paid a premium. If I could redo fridays trades I would’ve spaced my purchases out more but I am comfortable and confident we will see returns. 

Thankfully picked some more up after liquidation at pretty close to Friday low
C) both?!?
i diversified my 100% GME position on friday at the top around $42

So what you’re saying is GME and 🚀🚀🚀🚀. 

Well who am I to argue.
Who needs viagra when I can just read this
Have any calls or just shares? Excellent write up! Thank you for the great read
Does this post implies that you can read?? Where are the rocket emojis?
considering that we have short over 100%, could we say that we don't have a specific target price since they have to close over 100% of the existing float ??? if that is true, we could see shares going well beyond any pt maybe even greater than $ 1000 ???? 

In VW squeeze we had only a short interest of 12.8%, with an available float of 1% (ratio 1280%). even so, a short interest much less than 100%. With that I ask: how will shorters close without buying all the available shares???

We may actually be experiencing something we have never seen.

 Peanuts are symbolic of prosperity, wealth, the stability of life, Fortune, benevolence, and empowerment: Seeing peanuts in your dreams, being given them, or growing them, is a strong representation of this omen/interpretation. Peanuts are a sign of blessed times. As a time of worry falls behind and a new era of happiness anew steps forward for you.
Just buy stocks.  You can get got on a weekly option but stock will eventually recover.  Yeah you could time the drop..... But you'll probably mess it up like I did and miss out on tendies.
Fuck kinda feet you got

I really want to hear back from people on this, THIS HAS NOT YET BEEN DISCUSSED ON THIS BOARD... We can create a VW style infinity squeeze on GME. All we have to do is order out our shares in certificate form from our brokers. Then they can't lend them. If everyone on here does this (or even a large portion) we can tighten the amount of shares available for shorting even more. This will force even more short covering. What are people's thoughts on this? 

Here is an article about how this works from the Wall Street Journal in 2006: [https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115448639392724266](https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB115448639392724266)

The US is infinitely better in terms of opportunities for wealth. If you go to an overcrowded country of a billion, like India, you see that for every job opening there's atleast a queue of 100 people waiting like they are getting free stuff

This is where my brain keeps going - run the numbers and both scenarios seem more similar but different levers. In VW case Porsche was the lever - here retail is the lever. I’m digging in deeper and holding the line. 

Thanks for taking the time to put this out there, because I think you are onto something.

Amazing quality. One of the best WSB memes ever.

No clue, I think people are just trying to ride the wave before it crashes.

Sorry I should've included /s. This is WSB not r/investing or r/personalfinance. No one here is supposed to know how to not use margin

Why buy shares when I can by weekly FD’s until the moonshot cools off?
No dude you don't want to do that.

Great analysis. I personally think it will fall short term but will do well longer term
Praying for my 1/29 calls to print!
In challenging times such as this I am all in on GME and BB
lmao. Hence the value trap thesis.  What if you become a holder and not a trader should the short squeeze not come. lol.

I understand that, I have a feeling a lot of others here don't. Like I said this could turn into amateur hour real quick.

So you didn't immigrate then. Splitting hairs I suppose. Anyways, you complain about corruption and then talk about commies like only commies can be corrupt. Pretty funny. Its like me saying "man I hate jocks they are so dumb, if I were in charge all baseball players would have to study 12 hours per day." But apparently hockey and football players get a pass.


I also particularly enjoy the part of your comment where you ignore the US destabalizing communist regimes leading to rampant corruption.
🥜🥜🥜🥜🥜 What means if you sell GME you’ll get peanuts compared to what it’s really worth
Whats the line
TLDR: don’t be a pussy.  Use trailing stops if you’re scared.

No shit
I HAVE A DREAM, THAT ONE DAY THE MARKETS WILL CEASE TO OPEN RED!
Agreed. I was just more concerned about specifically next week. People have high expectations now without recognizing the fact that short sellers like Melvin have way deeper pockets then retail traders. They can hold out longer than people give them credit for.
And a cat
So basically as an European without access to robinhood I can only buy/sell shares......all in GME?
Great interpretation! I was already going to buy more shares at open Tuesday. But now I’m buying even more!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
If RC triggers the MOASS will he eclipse Daddy Musk and Momma Wood as WSB favorite?
I am absolutely positive that people with the right calls are going to profit massively. But the buy shares gang isn't a conspiracy.
what does this mean, gme🚀🚀🚀 ??

Fuck I don’t know
Someone please do a 12 page long DD analyzing his tweet please
Markets are closed this entire week. They’ll be open again next week.
WHAT DOES THE PEANUT MEAN
GME set aside a *dollar* amount that they could raise from selling stock, not a number of shares. They wouldn't get any more money from selling shares at a higher price. That being said, they CERTAINLY would rather sell at a higher price because like /u/r34p3rex said below, getting their money out of stock when the stock is trading higher dilutes the shares FAR less, and would have a much lower impact on the share price. Basically the ideal time to do it would be when the company needs money, but the share price is artifically way too high. Kinda like when Tesla offered a bunch of shares. They really needed the money but it didn't hurt their share price at all because they were already trading at like 2500x P/E.

So they’re kind of working themselves into a share of Microsoft’s future pie? That is definitely worth something. Is this revenue from the Xbox Live sales, or is it going to be on Gamestop’s new digital platform?

No chance it opens red. The 10 yr old on the corner is talking about gme
You're assuming any of us can actually sing on key. /s
in any case if tuesday ends up being disappointing don't sell. long term odds are good.
The universe would make it trade exactly sideways just to make me look like a moron.

If you are a long-term investor, do not worry about timing the market. If BB hits 20, what difference will it make if you bought at 11.4 or 10?
That’s exactly why he’d announce it tomorrow retard, would mean Tuesday at open all shorts are trying to close their position
Governments cannot fund themselves on deflationary policies.  Printing money devalues ever dollar you have, and will make the ability to buy a Tesla harder and in-turn a reversal will be much greater.  I am putting my long term future in moving into assets not associated to the US Dollar.

Burry has shorted Tesla and didn't go well.

Even the greatest lost money with bad decisions.

You can't be so retarded. You can't think... If this smart guy bought it, everything is gonna be all right.

At least take a look at what I just posted and have a second thought
This week or next. I bought Apple and NFLX this week
Probably short term increase to around 42$ where it will hit a short seller induced ceiling and slowly trickle down from there the whole week. That's just my guess.
Doesn’t it eventually have to go down to catch up to the sp500s incredibly slow rate ?
Just wait until the next gang comes.
I honestly have no fucking clue what he's trying to say

You guys are either going to make BANK or get absolutely fried. Either way I’m here for it.
I'll try to summarize since there's so many reasons. And I'll leave some sources at the bottom

\- Ryan Cohen (RC) is transforming GME into THE one-stop shop for all things gaming. RC's plan is to monetize the transition to digital gaming that GME is failing at. He has a plan for this - more on this his open letter (source below). There's no way he bought 13% of the company and NOT have a plan. 

\- RC succeeded with Chewy and beat Amazon in their own game focusing on pet food/supplies, superior customer service, and industry specific knowledge. He's doing the same at GME. RC became a billionaire in his early 30s and knows what he's doing. RC is one of the top entrepreneurs in the world.

\- RC was able to bring in his Chewy team to GME so he has the right people around him

\- RC's GME will be the same business model as Chewy's (superior customer service, industry specific knowledge, with comparable logistics/delivery) except the infrastructure is already set up. Current GME stores will be the new fulfillment centers and the supply chain is already set up. He will aim to please the customer, not try to screw them over

\- The pet food/supplies Total Addressable Market (TAM) is about half of the video game TAM. CHWY is at a 40B market cap with 6.5B in annual revenues. GME is at 2.5B market cap with 6.4B in annual revenues. There's a huge disconnect here because GME is being priced as a retailer and not a E-commerce business. If this transition is successful, there will be a huge change in valuation.

Dead companies don't go to the hundreds.
Twitter finance and stocktwits are so cringe. 90% of those accounts have to be fake right?
you forgot one scenario, GME decides to take advantage of the bump and do a massive share offering to generate capital, stock price plummets; that could happen without notice and is likely

PLTR is probably going to run up in short term, but as soon as lockup period expires it will crash harder than FUBO. 

FUBO crashed on 3x float... imagine PLTR at 5x float.
This is it 💎🤲
Well see, nobody here is really planning to hold shares in 48 months so that’s pretty irrelevant, this is mainly a short to mid-term play

Cuz PLTR is going to go up.  
Yes, it will hit over $50 so you are capped at making $2,345 from each bundle and not a penny more.  
But it's a free $2,345 that you have locked in.  
It's a little too r/options for this sub because it's a safe play but gains are gains.  
I would rather feed you some gains now so you can bump your account nicely before blowing it completely on something stupid.

I get what you are saying but rolling wont help cause they still bleed money. and rolling means they realize losses.
to add: in my thought experiment there is a float of <1m shares. so they cant even cover a big part of their first shorts and roll forward? there would be no or minimal covering.

I'm actually playing a straddle.  I own shares and far OTM puts later out in the calendar.

I have very low bid price for OTM puts further out in the calendar, should it short squeeze.

But yes, not in 3 months.  6 months is when they face default. so see you then.

I still argue GME is going to 0 within 48 months with 95% confidence.
Yeah that's what I would say, but I am not sure that's the intendwd message. I have no better idea, though. Loading up tueaday at open for sure

This hurts me so deep.  I was talking to my brother about buying a thousand shares a couple nights ago when I saw it at $9.

I am unfortunately not retarded enough to belong here.... I had shares at 2.23... and have been cautiously securing profits as it went up.

Depends on what you want to risk, I’m going to sell enough on the first moon to cover my cost basis of my shares and hold the rest, so my average cost of my shares is around $22 so I’ll sell probably around 1/4 of my shares around $88 and hold the rest
u/savevideo
Hope he nuts on me
Nuts...youre telling me there’s a chance Ryan Cohen nut on bears. 🍆💦
Go hawks lol
The higher the price, the less it dilutes. It's a $100m in shares offering, not a fixed # of shares offering. At $20, it'd add 5 million shares or a bit under 10% to the outstanding shares. At $200, it'd add 500k shares, less than a percent

Their position is strictly for profits. If it’s too costly they wouldnt do it. They have actual investors and bosses to answer to when it comes to the money they are working with.
I already asked myself this, how long can they justify this within their company? So much money just for shorts on a company thats not even in the news. Like either its part of a bigger plan or they will pull out soon and go somewhere else
GME dies if I try to jump in Tuesday right?
The price right now is peanuts or the gains have been peanuts.

I honestly don't understand why msft has essentially flatliners while all other tech has skyrocketed. Their suite of products is huge for wfh, and teams will absolutely tank zoom, because zoom has no way to monetize and no real staying power.

I've been long on msft for several months, but considering getting in with more since their revenue is so consistent and I think that azure and the 0365 play will only make them stronger.

That's what I did, but I'm using cad. Just incase it does moon pre market. I don't want it to fill if it's at like $60 or something crazy like that, just to inevitably crash.
I thought the same until I played it, now I’m addicted.
do you even have to ask?
Just make sure the code is either: WSB, SKRLI, RTRD, or AUTIS
The autists will now control the market.
Not entirely true. The shorts originally thought it would go bankrupt. It has since been clear GameStop will remain solvent. On top of that, they filed SEC forms to allow them to sell 6mil shares. That would more than cover the entire debt load, plus profit. I think Cramer even mentioned it. You want to bet against a debt free, profitable company...be my guest. I'm buying $3k more on Tuesday
Short squeeze back on😹
What does the tweet mean?
Pos: 3000 shares @ 20 (averaged up after 2500 @ 16)

33 4/16 25c @ 2.5

9 2/19 20c @ 2.22

GME gang since early December. I am hoping for GME to be in the triple digits here but it may take a while. It's always been an asymmetric post-Q4 report play but there's a lot more retards joining in so I'm thinking it's going to be a slow, steady climb over the next two months. The power of "n" makes a big difference on this play and it seems like more people are jumping onboard.  GLTA. Hope you make some $$$!

RC tweets. GME moons. It’s that simple. Still hoping it opens flat or red though so I can load more. My calls would get crushed but it’s fine
Indeed. I'm using margin as well, despite better judgement, so when it moons I'm going to sell enough to at least clear my margin holdings and be straight cash.
GME is still cheap as peanuts!   Buy More!

No healthcare, no abortions and zero restrictions on guns. Republicans would turn us into a third world country in a second
Yea lots of people from r/all who are fomoing are going to get burned. Not that there isnt any upside as there certainly can be but man this is a dangerous game and people are going all in on it which is terrifying. Cheers and goodluck
Hm... this is Robinhood? I'm not seeing it on the desktop/web version.
The amount of Cohen succcking going on is unbelievable. The only thing he’s done so far is not get crushed by Amazon(yet) with chewy
Ohhhhhhhhh fuck. It’s happening!!!!
That's ridiculous. It's not a different perspective, it's someone terribly underwater trying to convince the largest retail gathering of shares to lend them out to shorts.

10:1 its an institutional insider because no autists actually knows that much. As seen by how quickly the brainlets here fall pray to a sense of authority and strong wording.

I got my dad to join a week ago lol sorry retards but he’s only lurking

Alright, this is about the 100th GME DD I've read this weekend alone. This one, however, is the one that got to me. I don't have much to help the cause, but 10K will go to GME shares Tuesday at close. 🚀🚀🚀
why would he go back to russia?

trump wants to be a dictator but usa has laws
Great idea!
Down 25% and 12% lol
Yes, when it eventually his 60$, people going to be saying "man I wish I got in at 35$"
Rockets, more rockets and even more 🚀, is all the DD I need
[deleted]
I’m only investing freed up monies. Not desperate enough to risk everything!
So, same as everyday then?
This is the way
I mean its not really manipulation unless there was a massive coordinated effort in a private chat or a discord server or something. The SEC sees our daily chat and calls a mental hospital not the feds.
I need to buy more shares ASAP. 

Open the fucking market!
A peanut emoji means he upped his stake? I honestly don't know how anyone gets anything out of a random emoji.
Thanks man. Sorry just one more question, so if the price peaks (e.g. 100usd), do we sell since it could drop back to the 30usd area and then hold the shares until it exceeds 100usd? Just trying to play out the scenarios in my head. Sorry for being a noob XD
Only 12 buying more tomorrow.
🥜🥜🥜🥜🥜🥜🥜
😔😔
It has dinosaurs on it
Why would margin requirements change?
Maybe? Remember the share price was pushed down by manipulation. You are essentially betting the manipulation is over, and I can't say that for sure. Your odds are good, but this is why GME is a shares play, so you can wait out the fuckery.
I’m over the moon!   
We are retards and WeWantCohen!
Pretty sure it does  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Hey man thanks for this! ALOT of people are in this thing and don't understand (even myself) some of technical lingo. This is great keep up the good work. respect and diamond hands

The horniest part is Cathie dropping $12 mil day after Citi downgrade. She literally does not give a fuck what boomer analysts say and thats what differentiates her  from the rest. She has been seen to be right about the future and innovation because she understands that this is the next step in the global economy and. Boomers cant seem to realize it because their too busy deciding whether coca cola is underweight or overweight

Make sure to pay your respects by buying from chewy (even if you don’t own a pet).

Fck yea lol
Yeah same experience at LA for me lol

Hot tub is full of milfs tho
I follow your lead blindly.
When a shorted stock experiences a price increase, the shorts can roll over their position to the new price, by covering their old positions and taking a loss and then shorting again at the new price range. Wednesday had bullish sentiment so people started buying and price went up. Shorts see this cover some of their position contributing more to the price hike but also roll the shorts forward to a safer position. I don't know why everyone assumes a short squeeze has to go allllll the way to zero short interest to be deemed a short squeeze. Anytime shorts contribute to a price hike by covering or rolling over their shorts, that is a squeeze. There is no way that the short position has been held at the same price point since the initial price a year ago. These aren't some basement traders. There are rules for risk management that entail necessary short rolling as price increases. Why is everything so black and white on this sub.
Nice write up.  Thank you.  I read every word. Information is power...or....aka $$$$$
🥜 is the new 🚀
No offense to MLK day but we should be trading tomorrow. How many off days does the fucking market need?
But what does the emoji mean??
Yes, that’s one of the exciting things. They should be a $15 billion company minimum based on their cyber security business alone, right now you are buying that at a steep discount and getting their automotive moonshot for free. 

That’s why I have 40,000 BB shares, 800 contracts. There’s just no better play out there.
The fact that Cohen has  acknowledged the short means It’s now become personal.. I’m all in
I agree that the GME posts are getting exhausting....but if we could just get half this sub to buy 30+ shares...🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💩
Agreed it's inevitable, but a squeeze has been talked about for months now. Every time it has moon, I have seen tens of posts saying "Get in now, squeeze is imminent". Forgive me for becoming cynical from all of those. Still, I want GME to moon like everyone else too lol

just don’t diamond hand it when the squeeze actually happens. y’all just have a single day to sell at the top
Florida?
Because you have to wear a walking helmet would be my bet
Definitely not lmao, please don't margin the shares unless you absolutely know what you are doing and have the capital to back it up if its called. 

Ppl don't have to buy that many shares to have an effect! Like, if everyone on WSB bought 10 shares and held, the shorts would be screwed.
Thanks bro how long would it take to get anywhere near that I gotta sell this idea to my wife it’s my bread but you know how that goes

Tbh these wall Street cunt flaps have been hoarding the cash and trade secrets for years. it's all highly informed and calculated gambling and the more regular people that have access the better. Yeah some of us lose but plenty of people used a gamified phone app to completely free themselves from debt and servitude to the corporate machine. Undeniably a prize worth fighting for and with much much better odds than the Lottery...

How would losing a license be bullish???
I think sometimes people forget that institutions aren't stupid and that they are just as willing to make a quick buck as they are to hold for years. And that is a complex duality because a lot of what we think about institutions is A or B instead of A and B. For some of these institutions just like some momentum traders this a beautiful pump & dump. It's easy money. They go in, they get it, they leave.

That's why it takes months, not days, to measure it out. I mean bots and other "players" are also going to be in here so you'll see really weird stuff from time to time that looks and feels like it's genuinely forward facing but turns out in two months to be nothing but a blip.

And I mean you are actually just seeing the same image as a positive rather than negative attribute; no one fought Cohen because honestly no one knows what to do with this thing and it isn't that Cohen is brilliant but that at this point it just doesn't fucking matter. 

I mean back to the coach analogy you've got players volunteering and putting up their own money to keep the team going to lead it to the next championship and the coach has no plays in the book so ... fuck it. 

That scares me. I don't see that as a good thing. That is literally the opposite of a good thing in my business mindset. If anyone can walk into your house and decorate the thing that means you're fucked. Keep in mind I am thinking a few years out so it's not going to be a matter of this play. It'll pass. I am more interested in 6 months down the road where this is.

[deleted]
To be completely honest with you, if you ever have a question about something ask because you’d be surprised of the profession some of is have.
Is TSLA dead? I've bought 3 shares @ $868 and it keeps going down. There are a lot of short interest, I think. Any hope it will start again to be green in the next days?
I'm no expert, but I think they can avoid getting margin called as long as they can afford it. If the price continues to go up, it will be more and more expensive to do so, and especially with the very high short borrowing fees. At some point, they will probably decide that it this trade is no longer worth the risk, and cover their short position.

So your argument against people saying buy shares, is somehow they are in league with melvin and it's ok to buy things other than shares because they can do the math? ok...  Own 6509 shares, am not in league with melvin.   

Buy shares. Options are a hypothetical price mover in the future, shares move it now.

oh absolutely, it is pretty funny to me all these posts I am seeing and their average cost for shares is like $35 so they just bought in and are way too emotional about this. I still think there is major upside to GME even without a real short squeeze

I could be wrong but here’s some math: 30,000/36.24=827.81457 shares at current market price. If it squeezed to say $300 a share your shares would be worth 300*827.81457=$248,344.371

Is there anything defining what the vision for online trade-ins actually is? This article makes it sound like trading in your physical games via mail to gamestop. 

“Currently, trade-ins at GameStop act similar to a pawn shop, where games and consoles traded in are tied to that specific store’s inventory. The company would have to pivot from a pawn shop to an eBay imitation, with customers attempting to trade-in as the seller and GameStop being the sole buyer.”

The difference between trading in digits games and trading in physical games via mail is huge.

It is really not that impressive but logical. Many big institutional buyers want a discount for buying in bulk,  thereby setting a floor for future price. Why do big institutional buyers want in? Because the product is disruptive.

Also, I'm curious, how would you pay off the margin fees if you invest all of your margin loan into municipal bonds?

* Would your brokerage (e.g. Robinhood) automatically take out the margin fees from your municipal bonds?
* Would you have to pay the margin fees out-of-pocket and then constantly withdraw the difference from your municipal bonds as your income?
* Would you just leave the entire margin loan in your municipal bonds, letting the fees and dividends stack up indefinitely?
Holy shit. Calm down Chad Dickens.

This is stupid and you probably know it, but in case you didnt, let me quickly disect your points for you and show why they are moot. 

Basically what you are arguing is that Ryan Cohen wont be able to compete with Sony and Microsoft in selling games, since you didnt do any research and thought the plan was for Gamestop to keep relying on games for the majority of their cash flow. This is wrong in many ways. The plan isnt to keep selling games, but somehow do it online, and thus stay in bussiness. The plan is to switch focus to becoming a cultural center for everything gaming. The one stop for gaming, a game stop if you will. Imagine stores filled with PC parts and accecories, gaming collectibles, esports events and an internet cafe section with cunning employees who can help you with anything computer or gaming related. All these items are high-margin items in a market that is growing by over 10% yoy with some projections showing future growth to be even higher. Heck even today 1/6th of Gamestops revenue, about 1 billion dollars, already comes from collectibles and that stuff is high margin af. Over 33% of revenue comes from online sales and their website is shit. Imagine if you had people who were actually cunning in e-commerce running the show with 55 million registered members in the US alone...

Thats how they improve cashflow, along with shutting down stores that arent profitable or barely profitable and which woudlnt make sense to renovate on the scale necessary.  The whole going bankrupt thing is a joke as well, they have been improving their margins and cut costs by over half in 2020 alone, if you think a shift to higher margin items already take place,  a halving in cost and all the other changes will have them loose as much money as they did during 2020 and will go bankrupt in 6-8 months then you are beyond saving

Lastly let me touch on your short-squeeze comments. This is the place where I can notice the most that you didnt do any research, since noone is saying that we are in the short squeeze right now, or that Melvin capital has been covering their shorts. Reverse there have been like 1000 posts by now about how the short interest has actually increased to record levels in the past week. This is a good thing, it means the squeeze would be based off of current levels, which are about 2x what they were before, and that there is more squeezing to be done since more shorts would need to cover their position. Just sustaining this price levels, without a jump in price once RC announces his plan for Gamestop going forward, or when he inevitably increases his share % to 19.9% or if Gamestop has a profitable quarter, even if none of that happens, shorts would have to sell their positions within 2 months or they would loose more in fees than the entire earnings potential of their positions and thats not even taking into account the literal billions of dollar they have paid in fees to maintain them so far. Even if you didnt think Gamestop had a long future ahed of it, the short squeeze would still be very likely. 

Let this be a lesson, dont go calling Ryan Cohen, Michael Burry and the tons of other GME investors who are way smarter than you retards. Best of luck trading and please short GME for us.

Would it be illegal for us to all consolidate our GME positions to get a more accurate estimate of the actual available float?  


VW squeeze was largely because of the massive restriction of the float.  


I think the #1 uncertainty I have about GME is related to the real float %. I've got nearly 25k invested b/w shares and ITM calls, I'm wondering how many other autismo's have restricted the real float %.  


If I own 400 shares and everyone was owning 400 shares and we know insiders are holding \~20% of the stock....  


It'd only take 137999 other similarly low IQ individuals to completely lock up the remaining stock.

Sell some of the margin shares, to provide collateral to buy the rest of the shares on margin. This is a main reason why the shorts are fucked. They are in the red on the shorts on margin, so they have to liquidate completely

Okay, buy puts and post positions, I’ll buy shares, we’ll compare our profits/losses in 3 months.
Yeah if 5% pulled out all at once I agree. I was simply saying that selling into mass covering wouldn’t immediately reverse momentum. Ironically and to your point I think retail has more conviction towards the GME narrative and institutionals are more weary. Took them a few days after the board news to react. 

*That being said,* Cohen and his chewy buddies taking the reigns is probably GMEs best case scenario at this point. Obviously the risk is there that he can’t save this particular model. But the board didn’t put up much of a fight either by poison pill or proxy battle so I think Cohen presented a compelling argument. 

We’ll see, I’ve made a lot off the play so far and I hope you do too.

Democrats are making us a third world country with their inflationary policies too. Both parties are actively fucking us all right up the butt with no lube and people are too stupid to see it.
While all this is 100% facts and will happen eventually, it will not happen anytime soon. The FED has already stated interest rates will be as low as possible for the foreseeable future and they will do ANYTHING in their power to boost the economy. 

I will say my exit strategy is the second I see interest rates move up, I will pull out but the bull in me will just double down on calls. So we will see.

this is called a margin call, because the buffers in place to prevent an unintentional unlimited risk could cause the broker to lose out on gains if the short seller doesn't have enough capital to pay back the original shares.

Is it possible this DD holds the record for most  🚀
I’d say wait a couple of days.  The big banks came in way too hot and for any of them to go up on earnings they don’t only have to meet but significantly beat expectations.  JPM has an awesome quarter and still got punished.  Also bet you that regardless of how good GS or MS numbers maybe they will trade flat or go down on earnings.  The trade on the banks took place before earnings.  I would also pick individual names vs the XLF.
And this will happen most likely next week? Im planning to invest 1500usd so im trying to understand as much. Would be painful to lose this amount of money. Thanks for the help!

How will this make us rich at WSB?
Blockbuster tried a shelf offering too but was unsuccesful because everyone knew their business model had been disrupted.

Shelf Offering Investors aren't in it for a short squeeze.  WSB is buying for a short squeeze.  If they don't get a shelf offering & continue massive operating losses last quarter, GME will default and many wsb will be wiped out.
So youre saying everyone should buy/hold at least 100 shares to really get our dicks up in melvin guts ? Im down. Lol im bored and have ample money w stimulus and having been working im so ready to make 1000% gains lol tendies for days

Could be right, could be wrong. I think the hype for next week/ next 2 weeks is justified but I also think people should buy this for the Ryan Cohen story. Playing the short squeeze will most likely make you money, but if you also believe in the future potential of GME their is no losing money. However, ONLY IF YOU DIAMOND HAND.

The most simple palantir perspective is cathie is the goat, and she bought 500k shares at 26 each.

10 times revenue  only works if you think the revenue is not growing substantially over the next 10 years. 

Tesla & NIO, for example, essentially have a government mandate to grow their revenue.  Policy makers are forcing the markets to buy their products essentially.  How the fuck is their revenue going to stay consistent over the next 10 years?

And that's not taking into account the fact that their "side" products, software and batteries, are and will be in huge demands. 

Hedge funds and PE are very similar in that there are only a handful of extremely savvy players in their markets who make the big bucks. The rest are morons.

JPM already ran.
Big buyers aren't autistic like us. They don't buy in and wait for news they will prob get news at the perfect time anyway under the table. The squeeze play from a risk perspective is not worth it for them. Obviously if news comes in, their top tier big boy brokers and algos will out-buy us instantly in real-time so they don't really need to sit in the way we do beforehand. That's exactly what happened Wednesday btw. We will never actually cause the squeeze to burst. We are merely keeping up pressure for some institution to cannon ball dive into this thing.

I did that as soon as I bought all of it, but again I'm not sure if it even truly does anything. Realistically my 600 shares can be ANY shares that RH has under brokerage, so I'd assume that they will just assign me different shares if the ones I happen to have in my account get shorted.

Maybe not though so that's why I made sure to do it.

So I might be a r*tard, why Tuesday morning? Why not Monday morning? I've never bought a stock in my life but I'm about to.
Markets will rocket Tuesday if Monday is also uneventful as this weekend
gonna be one of those weebs who says that the pacing gets pretty bad further down the line, but the story never stops being incredible. if u can’t deal with the pacing later on there’s a couple options.

1.) read the manga. there’s a couple changes that you haven’t reached yet, but one you would have cos it’s from the arc this meme is on, so it won’t ruin the story: >!when zeff and sanji get caught on the rock, in the anime zeffs leg gets cut off by an anchor whereas in the manga he eats his own leg so that he can give sanji all the food which makes sanji’s reason for staying and feeling like he’s indebted much stronger!< but if you don’t wanna read

2.) onepace is a proj that paces one piece like the manga, so it’s much less slow. from what i’ve seen of it, would reccomend.

anyway, this was the meme i needed as a die hard one piece fan. because of your post i’m all in on gme and buying more, that’s not even a joke. luffy wouldn’t doubt he could win and neither should we GME MOON, FUCK MELVIN ROCKETSHIP CREW ALL DAY 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
a 15% day on tesla on tuesday will get me so wet
He’s just shillin
people are dumb, and lazy
[removed]
then you're just retarded
oh Tuesday will either be like VW squeeze day..or black monday yaaaayy
to explain dividends... if you have $20M at 4% growth, that’s excellent plus a guarantee of $X every quarter... you could easily live the rest of your life doing NOTHING and collecting checks while your networth grows; TLDR - dividend stocks are for big money passive income with no volatility
I don’t even understand the digital play people talk about. All games are available directly on the PlayStation and Xbox store.
Guys... will GME really squeeze? And should i get some shares? I'm a new retard here.
need PLTR to analyze the data points into a crayon graph for all the retards
WHY THE FUCK IS EVERYONE GETTTING ENGAGED FUCK ITS LIKE THE ONLY RULES MILLENIALS FOLLOW IS TRENDS
I'm sorry, I've just recently developed autism and I have no clue on where to find any links to read up.
Hahahha
Fine, $5,000

Fuck it, I can't lose more than 50-80%?
Quite possibly, if you can handle the volatility.
Dunno, what  like 12 to 15?
This is great

Real question here cause I’m new and only have Robin Hood......I’m worried that shit will crash on the most important day of the moon mission. Can you help me out with how to get a “real broker”? What does that actually mean? Lol
That is sooooo last two weeks
I keep seeing that margin could fuck you up but why and how?
Anyone have thoughts on banks? Worth getting into XLF?

Fuck you, I’m selling Tesla and buying more.
Make sure your position doesn't expire before April 40th. (4/20) because if the squeeze hasnt happened by then i expect us to engineer an attack to have it happen on that exact date.
Killer write up. We could see some action next week or when that stimmy pump hits
Butt my calls are worthless all the time?
Damn this will be a war
it is dying, which is why activistts like ryan cohen are taking over. They have a completely new vision for it, utilizing the strong brand

Well we both agree that there is more than one thing at play here. 

Let's pretend that we are right now talking about something more tangible to us. I will use a sports team and athletes for this.

R Cohen won *one* championship. One. He has two teammates who won with him. Great. 

The institutions are the coaches; they've seen athletes by the dozens who have won a championship but very few who have won *many* championships. 

Just from that alone I don't think the institutions are all that interested. There is way more money elsewhere. How can I say that? Well, if you think it through, a forum of random people on the internet owns 5%. Five percent. That's unheard of. If institutions are the big players at the table and they are leaving so much off of it that retail can take that much in a matter of months the eye is turned blind.

Remember that the coaches in the analogy are thinking seasons, not a season, while retail would be the betters on the sidelines playing fantasy sports and thinking of a single season. In this case a business cycle is 8~10 years not 8~10 months. 

As I said, time will tell, and I might be wrong, but I think it's too soon; I need to see the actions, not just the promises, and certainly not just the fresh faces, because this company has had a board refresh twice in the last two years which means that the board is shit, not that it's great, it's the other way around. Gamestop is in dire straits if it is continuously shuffling it's kings and queens. 

Basically I'm saying that Cohen sitting on the board (which they offered to him months ago anyway) is not what you need. What you need is something that actually happens to the fundamental behavior of the company; I mean how many fresh CEOs and Directors show up, do nothing, and get replaced every year at even large firms? Hundreds. It's not new. And they don't even have to be "wrong" for it to just not take to the consumer base.

So, time will tell, but as for today if 5% pulled out that would definitely crush the price and the IV.
I can't believe I just spent a whole day watching GME memes
Disenchantment is good lol

I know Daddy Cohen wants to fuck shorts as much as we do. I feel he’s got something under his sleeves and he’s gonna make us cum real good🤤
Yes he will
You don't need hope the schedule is on the website:

>Sunday - Friday 5:00p.m. - 4:00p.m. CT with a trading halt from 3:15p.m. - 3:30p.m. CT; Daily Maintenance period Monday - Thursday 4:00p.m. - 5:00p.m

notice says nothing about MLK day eh?
Yes took ages, thanks a lot!
Tea land has a competent government, don’t get your hopes up
Very undervalued tech stock, their main focus is EV and cyber security’s. They lead in cyber security, and established a partnership with Amazon in Dec, and this past Thursday announced a partnership with Sony for their EV.
So what you're saying is drop 10k + margin into shares next week
Got it. Thanks for the response! Blackberry after GME or what’s up with it? Any links you can share so I can read up?
Set a high limit sell, they wont do it then, because if it moons the broker has to give you a lot of money

Set a high limit sell, they wont do it then, because if it moons the broker has to give you a lot of money
Can you elaborate why it's undervalued?
Ok, ok, I guess I'll sell some holdings and buy more GME.
why my dog avoid my kiss when i dont give him my plate -_-
Wholly discounting TA is for retards who make terrible entries and exits, it's better to know it than not.
In my mind EB games is just as trash. They stole my ghost recon game in '03 when my Xbox died and the disk tray wouldn't open. I couldn't force it open or else I would have voided the warrantee on the Xbox and wouldn't have gotten a 'refurbished' one in return. 

They stole my game, so I stole a controller for PC that didn't work on my shitty system at the time and I was never able to use anyways. Tit for fucking tat.

Point being, fuck EB games to death.
Yeeah boi.
There's a pandemic outside, you're saving lives by being a lonely investor ;)
I’d say depending on your expiration. If you have time you should at least be able to average down. Twitter is down 5% for the week and over 17% for the month. 

These loses can be assigned to a number of reasons however one of the most significant ones is due to the posible regulation backlash mango could impose on them.  

On Wed at 12pm that particular risk will be gone and we should at least see an upwards bump. 

They have also been working on a paid subscription model. If they provide an update on that feature it should help it pump. However who know when they will announce it
Unfortunately not due to holiday
[deleted]
Insane volume means everyone is watching it. Just don’t be disappointed after next week comes.
Yeah it was a sneak attack that caused the VW squeeze. But GME isn’t going bankrupt and the shorts will have to cover. Cohen executing plans quickly will cause increased pressure, making it difficult to exit slowly. No matter what they’re going to have to close into a loss at this point. Just a matter of how much pride they want to hang on to.
u should watch ‘the trillion dollar bet’ documentary. about the guys who wrote the equation n how it can be a fools errand trying to use it to dynamically hedge as they almost collapsed the economy by doing so lmfao .
[removed]
Thank you so much!
Retard who think BB will squeeze, why? 

I am team BB, I think it’s undervalued but with 550m shares outstanding and only 40m sold short that’s a 7% short/float ratio. 

HOW CAN IT SQUEEZE
if you invested $5000 in pfizer a year ago, you would have $5000 today
Well this is $ I don’t need right away and it’s for investment purposes only. I maybe a gambler at heart but I’m ok with the long game. Thoughts now?
March is fairly safe but in the other hand.. it could be stuck in the 20s until the merger finishes. Then it might be a week or 2 low 30s till it hits 40s/50s.

$5 closer than you think you need,  1 month longer.

It normally tracks US so tomorrow wont do much cos pre market wont be open
I've been obsessing over this stock for days now, trying to make conclusions.  


And although at this point I agree it's a hold. I'm able to see the direction they could go to reinvent. I can imagine ways that they can stay fun and relevant within the industry. I now officially "get it," and am excited for it.  


However, as far as your point about it not taking off next week, I disagree there. Personally, I think it gonna go straight Honey Baked at open on Tuesday. Everyone in the trading world is watching this stock like a fucking hawk at this point, and the slightest bit of momentum will send it flying.  


Now, this thought of mine is probably completely autistic, as you guys call it, but lets think about this. Imagine you're Marvin, or whatever that guys name is, and you've shorted GME into near oblivion, then literally millions and millions of investors catch on and start circling like rabid fucking dogs, foaming at the lips over the thought of a historical short squeeze, and on top of that, these people not only want the company to succeed, but genuinely believe it can and will...... You're completely fucked, you're down billions. Then, out of nowhere, GME does an offering. Normally, that would be a bad thing, right? Offerings: bad.  


But now look at it in relation to this event.... If i were them, and GME did an offering, I'd use that to get the fuck out of this situation and cover asap before the fire rises again.  


Point being, shorts are so fucked, that I think even an offering could potentially trigger the squeeze. Which is wild, and unheard of, but stranger things have happened this year.  


I think there's no stopping this train at this point.
Yea no one is doing it right, Samsung talked smack about Apple removing chargers and guess what they did
Why won't he tweeeet

To be fair he's right, I read the reply comment and didn't read the main comment as it seemed more applicable to me as scrolling down.

Now I've read it makes sense.

Unless I’m missing something that deal literally just means that GameStop will use Microsoft products in their retail stores such as Teams and Outlook. That is in addition to Microsoft continuing to sell Xbox items through GameStop. 

That doesn’t really seem revolutionary to me unless there is some hidden aspect I didn’t see.
Someone said Mein Pillow... thought that was cute.

Yes
You guys gotta do this. Buy GME on tuesday. You need to forget everything you’ve ever been told by your father, your grandfather, regarding investing. Those boomers never had the opportunity to actually coordinate with 1.8 million people. Why do you think the media is freaking out about us? Because we have had so much power for so long and we are just know recognizing it. We are like fucking anakin realizing his powers have doubled since he last met count dooku. 

Do you want to be a fucking cuck who talks about technical analysis and sells for a loss or a 10% gain every day? Or do you want to be apart of literal stock market history, that YOU and 1.8 million other retards MANIFESTED?
Shit! Now I Gotta ask the wife if I can buy more GME

You’re really missing the point.  Apple has what’s pretty close to a monopoly.  Sure, there’s some competition but not much.   Tesla has competition everywhere... Europe, Asia, and now the US.   Plus, people can forgive Apple because they make a shit ton of money and generate a ton of cash flow.  Tesla does nether and won’t.   Do not confuse the two.   Tesla could very well become the modem day Cisco or Qualcomm or AOL.  Apple can be nimble because they make phones.   Tesla can’t be nimble bc they make cars.   This will not end well.

I just want the squeeze to happen asap... So that I can Fomo  all the gains   into gme again with 50x the shares for future growth
It would have hit if you sold it last week no? That would scare the shit out of me. I think I’m gonna sell one for $31.50 and bite my nails all week.
this is a good post for my question:

there is a float of 27m. so why is there no big boy or big fund who is willing to buy those? because of the rise by buying that would maybe cost 40*27m 1 billion, maybe up to 1.5. but they have the money and dont need to pay margin or borrow fees.
now there is no float. shorts are fucked and they need to accept any price from the new buyer. maybe the shorts would go bankrupt but before that everything they hold would be liquidated, in total that must be worth more than 1-1.5 billion, so the buyer makes bank?
Huh? We're talking about Corsair, not Crispr.

why not $40c 1/22?
Look at 2019. After divided cut. This is where most shorts would jump in. Sell offs would help the 70% share drop from $10 to $3.
If you scroll down near the bottom of a stock’s page there’s a section labeled “Margin Requirements”.

This doesn't make sense. Like it's not insider trading because we don't have inside knowledge. And it's even barely colluding as none of us are professional investors / firms / institutions. It's a bunch of private investors on the same page of where to try to gain. It could totally go tits up.

Besides, the SEC doesn't go after the institutions and insiders for all their clear as day illegal BS (I didn't see any insiders get clapped for covid).

It could go right back down, only reason is bb resolved the lawsuit, there is no + catalyst for it going up, we've seen this before.  Like I said before if there is shootout all hell gonna break loose.
Just saw Reddit has more monthly users than snap chat. Was spurred on by an earlier comment. This shit should go public
Yeah.... they want your money
If they did a second offering would, they would be creating new shares to further dilution? It would give them a cash injection but would dilute our shareholder value right?
I saw a lot of words, some 🚀’s, and a graph so I’m all fucking in
Mimosas are the shit
⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️⭐️ “Stunning” -Every WSB Autist
Look - I'm bullish on GME just as much as any other autist in here, but the reality of the situation as it stands now is shareholders can likely expect short term pain for long term gain. GME's stonk price is so high, the board would be pennywise pound foolish NOT to enter into an offering. Yes, they have a good amount of capital on hand and don't really need  anymore. BUT, their growth plans could be accelerated 10x with the additional capital. Also, the COVID-driven growth argument is valid so any and all transitions Cohen and company want to make MUST happen before COVID is behind us and things are back to normal. Time is of the essence. Also, if you look at the average share price Cohen bought in at, even with a 50% haircut to current price levels he will be safe and, thus, able to drive more shareholder value with the additional capital from the offering. It will be interesting to see what happens this week, but I have a feeling we will see a lot of profit takers followed by an offering announcement before EOD Friday. Either way, if you're in this for 12 months plus like I am, the opportunity is there. For the short term however, I believe we risk finding ourselves playing musical chairs...... and the music is about to stop. Then again, I'm just a random internet autist so take all this for what it's worth
When I see gamestop I see a dying buisness model so its really hard for me to feel confident investing like this

Pretty sure even cash-purchased shares get loaned out for shorts don't they? You don't have a choice when your shares get loaned out or which shares get loaned out, your broker does.
Health problems detoriate their mental state. Back when they were our age they probably were very happy too. We need to change our food system a bit for sure
Proceed with caution fellow autists 

More stimulus and direct checks into the economy lead to an inflationary spike that causes the Fed to discuss hiking rates and tapering QE.

The current rise in interest rates continues over higher inflation concerns until it impacts a debt-laden economy causing the Fed to implement “yield curve control.” 

The dollar, which has an enormous net-short position against it, reverses moves higher, pulling in foreign reserves, causing a short-squeeze on the dollar.

Why are shares better than options at this point?

Like the poster  said people are bouncing values around, I've heard 200, 420, 160 and even 900. 160 sounds good and plausible but again I can see why it's confusing, but guess no one can answer truthfully as it's a guessing game end of the day

Infinity or bust. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. 100 shares. 💎💎🤲
Thats a good question! Any answers for this?

Honestly the shorts are paying large margin rates of upwards of 50% at times.....so idk 


If the market trades sideways....they still have to pay that interest rate on their positions so they still loose.

Essentially if the price is explicitly going down they are loosing money
wait for expiry. Examine the price actions. 30 is the fucking resistance now

>RE: YESTERDAY'S MOVE, which continued in after hours trading and this morning. This IS the most plausible explanation. Credit on this board seems to be owed to Nelson. Some reports have suggested the move relates to the sale of the 90 patents to Huawei. Nothing to do with that. It seems a filling was made yesterday in CA court suggesting that BlackBerry and FB (WhatsApp / Instagram) will meet on February 11th. To settle their dispute. Nelson is constructive and credible in his comments. He posted the following about 12 hours ago - 'Global Settlement! ... "The parties are in the process of implementing a global settlement agreement and will resolve all claims and counterclaims in this action" '. It adds up. FB has lost some key arguments over the past 3 years. Also about a year ago it appears FB lost in German court whereby BB could have halted part of FB's activities. And on December 15th both parties signed an agreement in court to settle within a month. A number thrown out on this board suggests **$2 billion** could be the settlement , which works out very roughly $4 per Blackberry share. Yesterday shares were up $1.67 and in premarket about $2 so maybe that is what is being discounted. Each $ billion is worth very roughly $2 per BlackBerry share. What is it worth if one company can partially halt some of your activities and you are FB ? And if it is in fact $2 billion, is that for FB only (WhatsApp,  Instagram and others seem to be implicated) ? Additionally, this could be a catalyst to get some players in but perhaps they too recognize how inexpensive BlackBerry is relative to its opportunities, and see much more value but want to get in prior to settlement. Years ago well known and aggressive research boutique Citron Research stated BlackBerry was worth $25 per share. Today that is probably easily the base case scenario.

You deserve an upvote for calling ICLN back in November! 🚀
Everyone has being say the short squeeze is going to happen “soon”, for most of 2020....so don’t expect to try to time it. Don’t get me wrong, would love to see it, but based on the value of gme, still a solid stock (shares or long calls) to hold with or without a squeeze.
I’m an idiot what is ATH
Glad I'm not the only one who sees that, god reddit sucks  (sans WSB ofc)

how does the merger affect options?
We’re supposed to ignore the voluntary early debt pay down and their debt rating being upgraded too I guess.
Awesome!!! When did u start accumulating?
Maybe, SEC is probably shorting GME tho
Lol why did you sell ALL of them? Why wouldn’t you keep a few contracts why would you give up so close to expiration. 

You can blame WSB or paper hands but your whole strategy of all or nothing is where you’re going wrong. You think ppl on here NEVER exercise some of the contracts? It’s the discretion that you need.

I have January '22 leaps but I want to trade them for '23 leaps.

They're like $200 more and I'm buying an extra year. No brainer in my book.

Wish I had taken profit Thursday so I could have bought that dip Friday.
it says the only thing that can prevent a short squeeze of global proportions is to give the short sellers cheap shares to buy (ie selling shares) and buying shares will take the squeeze to intergalactic proportions.
I got an email that said they turned into February calls with the same strike, which would make them essentially worthless, but still says untradeable.  Dumb
Its going to 0 and the more spam I see about it the more I am convinced. 

If premium on puts was reasonable I would deff buy puts.
I had calls ending 1/15 which I exercised because it was a rough day for the market in general and I want to see what happens next week.  Already up 3x so not too worried. At this point I might just sell puts weekly and if assigned sell a covered call the next week.  Premiums are nice.  15% on the downswing 15% on the up, probably not returning to sub 20 anytime soon with cohen on board so limited risk (imo of course 😂). Buying call probably works too but a few weeks/months out.  It's already done 10x in price since July so I dunno if life changing yolo amounts are still possible, after this week it may just be steady upwards or whatever who really knows with the unique situation here.
[deleted]
Still dont buy it. Why the fuck will MS allow GameStop in their ecosystem if they already have a store? Same for all the others. Why would I allow a competitor to my own house? Makes no sense. I understand that the dude is supposed to be good but GameStop has nothing of value at the moment. Unless they own some patents that I don’t know about.
GME ALL DA WAY
So, my Twitter 44/45 call debit spread isn't fucked?
Thoughts on ICLN and clean energy in general after biden announced rejoining Paris climate accord first day in office via executive order?
And why sell at 99% loss anyway. Might as well hold to zero
Don’t you think that now that everyone knows about it, it won’t happen the way that WSB wants it to go?

Hydrofarm owns or has strategic partnerships with everyone.  They make tons of high margin items and it would take considerable effort not to use them in cannabis cultivation.   Their products are generally high quality and they are in a favorable position with increased legalization.
This needs to be pinned to the top of the sub. I feel a lot of people think they are going to get rich in 1 week. When they see the stock go to 34 this week will panic sell, gonna be amateur hour.
Would you still buy on current price?
Yes they can make it to the finals. Only realistic teams in there way are the Bucks and some will say the Celtics.
Cloud gaming is currently overhyped. ive tried stadia and nvidia geforce now, not good yet. Latency way to high. who says GME cant get in on it too?

Disenchantment season 3 was actually not bad. I enjoyed it
Agreed I’m new to WSB but not to trading stocks as that’s what I’m familiar with. I wouldn’t dare buy options, puts, shorts or anything else until I’m more familiar with it. Personally I stick to stocks as that’s why I know best. Some of these new guys will learn the hard way either through being arrested or losing their life’s savings. 

A lot of guys ask how do I buy an option or short, and it’s dude you’re going to lose your money if you’re not careful. Too many young bucks will lose their money.  I wouldn’t encourage anyone to invest money if they don’t know what they’re doing
Good analysis, but I'd bet WSB is not the only player left in the game.

In some regard going from sub $3 to over $40 in less than a year could be a squeeze of its own and I know plenty here are buying calls a week out thinking they’re going to trim $600 in $600k.

Regardless I’m in shares and plenty of bullish spreads.

Only problem I see is that you are basing your highest price too conservatively.  You aren't taking all factors into account of the share price rising to possibly $50 and then squeezing from there.

Everyone is watching GME at this point. It won’t be Volkswagen like squeeze. In fact I think the price stays sideways or lower.
They are so unhappy and angry. Like all the fucking time. I still don't fully understand it but man are they just so fucking miserable

Its emotionally exhausting to deal with them
That's a good point! I have some stocks I'm selling same day and will turn around to use those funds to purchase more if it dips. Even if it shoots up I'll probably still buy GME.
What about bill gates?
74 shares @ 10.62 probably buying 70 more at open Tuesday!
To andromeda and beyond friend!
I'm selling my TSLA Tuesday to grab moar GME. 

TSLA still has room to go, but I think that GME ROI will outpace it.  


My maths look like this:

1 TSLA @ 800 = 20 GME @ 40

If 1 GME @ 🚀 = 100, then 20 GME = 2000

Therefore, my autism says that TSLA would have to go up 1200 per share to make it as worthwhile to hold as GME.

Can anyone explain why people think shorts will cover? There are not enough shares available for them to cover, Cohen will have to start releasing shares from the treasury and this will drive stock prices way high.
when i think about the hours you spent rationalizing your bullshit and posting it here, I cant stop laughing. the shorts have more capital and more staying power than any of you 20-25 yr olds. this aint volkswagen and you dweebs are trying to convince this board of poor kids with 2000.00 account balances that they should dance with the elephants. 

I'm gonna save your post and throw it back at you when gme is at 10 bucks. But you'll be long gone by then and flipping burgers again. I have no position in GME....wouldnt touch it with your hands.
I will either be extremely happy or very sad come Friday. GME 1/22 $40c. Should have bought more stonks dammit.

I don’t know a single damn person who has made a purchase from GME in the last 5 years. Not one. 

🚀🚀🚀Ride the rocket for as long as you can but long term (2y+) this is Blockbuster.
100 shares it is.
when the AMD bleed gonna end
Winnie the poopoo
Shares will help more than calls. 
If ppl keep buying calls, the short squeeze thesis may not materialize fast enough and everyone will lose money.
Ok so the price rise from $20 to $42 was wall street bets and not institutionals digesting and reacting to the board reshuffle? Is that what you’re saying? At this point due to all of the media coverage yes retail is pulling a nice chunk of the float. But there’s a lot of players and the narrative of GameStop actually matters. So no if wsb all pulled out tomorrow it doesn’t change the seismic shift the company is experiencing and the FMV that GME will reach when they actually execute the new company vision.
I bought dividend stocks when they were cheap in March. I had no idea how the recovery might look but I knew they would hang in there and I’d get some dividends while I waited. They’ve paid better than any of my meme plays this year, rebounding 30-40% plus 5-8% in dividends. Now I’ve got a very cheap to me cushion that helps smooth out turbulence and works better for me psychologically. 

Long term trading isn’t about dollars it’s about sense, and having the sense to have a plan you can psychologically commit to without lol the bullshit stress you admit drive you out.
great topics i'm sure like, "my hat is way bigger than your, hosiah" and "you can't grow a beard. please get out"

If you’re investing with money you need to survive, then you probably should t be investing. Granted I’m only holding a couple hundred shares, but I’ll hold that till I die to fuck over the institution.

So then instead of "well everyone else is doing it" how about "hey let's not do it at all". I'm sorry that people shame you for your height, you're right, that is messed up. But it's these types of situations that are slippery slopes where people start to think "well this is what I have to go through, so I might as well turn around and just add more back into the system", and that only ever makes things worse for everyone involved. Like it's not going to benefit you to shame other people, all you'd be doing is making people feel bad for no reason. It doesn't help anyone. Do you want to be calling people a "fat fuck"? Like does that honestly feel good to you? Rise above that shit.

No problem!
I have to question whether you are actually retarded or a big firm burner, actually it’s hard to be one without the other.  Nobody is going to buy this bullshit, if you want to convince retail traders that the outlook is bearish you have to show how the bearish outweighs the bullish, not ignore and misrepresent the bullish to make it all look bearish.  Fucking retard, no wonder you’re working at a big firm, only way you can make money in the market is manipulation.

If they raise the minimum wage to $15 / hour, I'll no longer be able to afford escorts using my investment gains :-( AMA
Just trying to offer some constructive advice here, but, if you are making day trades often enough to trip the pattern day trader rule, and you don’t have 25k in your account, you are probably making true “bets”, and the house odds are not in your favor over a long time period. 

As an example, I’m personally in some pretty big positions and am up 50% from 2M to 3M since Halloween (when I really started being aggressive). Not on GME, but on other “similar” plays. 

I haven’t executed a single “round trip day trade” in that entire time. 

💎🙌 is the way. 

The best way to be able to do that is to actually research the hell out of the big trades you do, and be able to project out the most likely trading range one year from now, and the lowest a stock might dip in the meantime. Make sure you will be comfortable with that temporary loss if that dip happens.
Good luck and see you on Alpha Centauri 🚀🚀🚀🚀
well if she wins a senate seat or speakership then you will see
They can't cover, there are enough shares available for them to cover. Cohen will have to start releasing shares from the treasury, this in turn will drive prices way up.
Is already a weed stock lol
Real good
You sound like a boomer, information is always changing google sucks compared to our hive mind.
They have 100m in shares listed on shelf registration. Thats all they can sell and when it goes up the diltution decreases proportionally.
Hey, I'm fairly new. And also broke as fuck (talking $300 to spend). My measly 8 shares is gunna be a piss squir tin the ocean. Is it wise to drop all that cash on some short term calls, bolster my buying power and then go ham on stock?

Apparently some guy did that from 8 shares to 400 last week.
yep stay on earth and i go to 🌕🚀🚀🚀🚀
💎🙌
Actual solid advice. Written to you in a language even you can understand 😉
depends on your risk tolerance. I've been selling puts since IV is so high. If it drops, then I get cheaper shares. If it goes up, then I keep all the premiums.
Really good read. I think the biggest problem is convincing investors that a $1.5t company is a growth stock, especially when they are seeing %500 returns in evs, genomics, and ipos.
Yes
If any boomer is reading this look up TLS it has had constant growth probably from insider information and it even hasn't had earnings yet. Buy it on the next dip

100 shares at $21.23
Maybe? It’s gonna b happening for months it’s already started
REEE would be a good too I think, though like others have already stated: TARD is probably the obvious one.

Yes. Retail diamond hands and Cohen’s decision to up his stake will be the nails in the coffin for sure.
But let’s also not forget that margin requirements are increasing and retail shorts will also start getting margin called. It’s looking slightly bullish for now. 
Any new gme news will also cause some major shorts to drop and cover. Cohen is smart. Let’s not underplay what he can do.
1 month old account, first post ever. Immediate ban. Fuck you Melvin
Do you actually think that, or are you just hoping?
Haha. Fuck off boomer.
Same situation here in the UK, have you looked at IG?
Watched it, was good enough :)
I am completely certain that digital distribution platform will fail if tried, and that they would not be able to afford steam since it’s not for sale, and even if it was, google, amazon, ms and game industry majors all want it very badly and would pay in excess of $10b and have more ways to leverage so more valuable to them. I can explain in more detail if you want the discussion, but I really am certain that’s a pipe dream.

I also am certain that Cohen will execute well, but don’t see how legit price should be a lot higher than this a year from now, but I guess that’s a matter of opinion. 

As for the firm filings, they have 45 days past the quarter end. We won’t know if burry was long dec 31 until feb 15, and we won’t know if he just sold this week until May 15.

To all autist,
Please just go to Melvin Capital’s Google reviews the place is a goldmine!!!
Either their research was shit, or they are greedy.

They could have liquidated their position when this thing was below 10. They didn't.
I think long term scale will change profitability.
If my calls print, which luxury watch should I buy?  I can only really afford rolexes.
No lol
And your gonna hear it again.
CLDR NEEDS TO BOUNCE FOR MY LIFE
Kinda true and kinda BS.  Example; volume on round number options are always much higher. When a stock on the way up or down hits a specific value say $200 - $300 - $400 etc a bunch of contracts are automatically triggered moving the price up or down creating a base or resistance.  That my friend can be read in a chat.  Is technical research the only indicator hell no, but it does tell a story.
This is wsb the only thing I can imagine is green days.
So true - all my big losses were from selling too early when the stock was dipping. Now I'm doing the exact opposite and buying up those dips.
Wasnt Tim Apple one of the few people that was saying V shape recovery back in our darkest days? Im starting to realize that 90% of analysts are wrong.
Yes, this is the way

Elon needs BB actually.
What happens with GME on Tuesday?
These wallflowers are afraid to join their tard brethren in the squeeze play.
I don't understand. If you were so confident in GME, why not just buy  calls with further out expiration dates?
I'm not poor but I never forget where I came from.  I would aim to help those that were in my shoes.  That somehow makes me a hypocrite in your eyes.  

I am not sure I even know why I care to try to deprogram you.   I've never succeeded before on anyone and I don't think today will be the first
[removed]
how much?
or if you're a lefty r/politics
Past is not indicative of future

Also in the past that was the "normal" trading pattern, but what happened recently was not "normal" and therefore you can't expect the same to happen. 

RC and getting 3 board seats, was the catalyst and now that GME is getting more exposure we have more retail and institutions buying in.  This didn't happen last year.  There was no catalyst as big as that.  This probably set a new floor, the lowest it dipped to was 34.30 before rebounding.  I'd estimate the new floor is somewhere around there.

Also brokers removing margin and the SEC tick rule were things that didn't really happen in the past, but it did on friday.  Shorts aren't able to short unless its on an uptick, which means less manipulation of share price.  We'll see, but I'm pretty bullish on next week, even if it doesn't squeeze doubt we'll see a big dip like we saw on friday.

Ok, you're telling me to max cash and margin on GME? All in? Ok will do sir.
Barely any talk about the massive amount of shorts, no reference of the fact they have new leadership with experience in online stores, parroting the same shit articles have been repeating ignoring the same shit that gets explained here, ignoring their shift to online sales has already increased.

Their loss is going to lower from shutting down stores that weren't profitable and focusing on ones that are. So the loss for the last quarter may plummet significantly, we'll see.

The price just jumped which is going to put extra pressure on the shorts. Not only that, but a lot of shares are owned by WSB retards who aren't letting go for $30.

Blockbuster was already on it's way out and tried switching online as a last ditch effort.

Gamestop lost money due to *checks notes* the local governments using shutdowns to help against a pandemic. I can see the similarities.

We putting the pressure on $BB this week? Tuesday I’m going to buy 200 shares either way because I think it’s only a matter of time.
the question is can they make EVs and be profitable? So far none of the EVs by big manufacturers make them money its like a vanity project. 

Even Tesla loses money on its EVs without carbon credits.
this is the way

Try closer to about $5k. Even SPY is better than that. Of course there's a lot more to it than what you're thinking as well; people do revolve the EX-Dates for dividends so they get the same benefits for holding 1 day as you might for 1 year.
Yeah hes mediocre at best

the price is about the same on both exchanges, so I don't think you should worry about that

Thanks, I am greener to this for sure. That just seems wrong as fuck.
we shall see with its next earning release, if your hypothesis is correct.

  If the operating cash flow are still around -100M, GME will need cash very soon or risk default
Agreed, I buy Whole Foods only so it starts racking up. Pay my internet, phone bill, gym, etc with it as well.
Honestly, I’m hoping it finds support at 10.50. I think there was a lot of profit taking Friday. Lots of people were bag holding this one. Definitely an undervalued company
haha id be surprised if they knew mlk is not celebrated in europe
Elvis is alive too. He's living in the ceiling of a gas station in El Paso.
This is the best case scenario that I'm hoping for. Definitely want to get back into GME after the squeeze as well.
Earnings are important then we need to see if the market assigns a new multiple to AAPL given their EV ventures, totally possible
Anyone else dreaming about their positions? Just me? This can't be healthy

I wouldn’t get in their way unless you have the superior upper hand of deepfuckingvalue
Im a huge gme bull, but stop shitting on this dude for providing his insight. Everything he said was cohesive and backed by evidence. I’ve been holding shares and calls since September and never even thought about selling, but now I am starting to get worried. Why? Because people are too focused on the squeeze and not on GameStop as a company. GameStop isn’t squeezing in the next two weeks, and all you paper hands are going to get bored and move onto the next thing. This is a mid/long term play and Relies on gamestop proving it is here to stay. If it weren’t for Ryan cohen and burry trying to change the company, GameStop would be dead by 2025. Position: 200 shares
People use to move to try to find a better life when they couldnt afford to live somewhere. Now they wait on the government to solve their problems.

We can set the price just based on # of shares we hold. But the shorts truly determine if it happens quickly or will take some time. If they flinch first it is over and moves fast. But if they double down then the war of attrition kicks in. Just hold tight and be 💎 🙌.

I’m gunna liquidate some of my long term positions to buy more GME shares Tuesday. Thanks brother!
Exactly. So obviously now it’ll take off
*While casual readers probably missed the potential import, investors homed in on that sentence. "I received an email from \[GameStop Investor Relations representative\] Eric Cerny and in the email he said, 'We are allowed to state we will receive a portion of the downstream revenue from any device we will bring into the Xbox ecosystem,'"* [*Domo Capital Management*](http://domocapital.com/) *President Justin Dopierala told Ars in an interview. He added that Cerny later clarified in a phone call that the deal applied to all digital sales on all next-gen Xbox consoles sold through GameStop.*

What is the percentage they will get?  Also, its like blockbuster getting a percentage off its customer for introducing them to Netflix.  It helps Microsoft, and kills off GME faster, as its customer see that Xbox Store is a better value proposition.

Ask yourself, if you're in this for the short squeeze or you can see GME not only surviving but thriving in this generation console.
Definitely one of my favorites.
What's it with rice?

The new consoles still have discs and most people seem to prefer the disc version. Gamestop will be fine for many years to come, even if nothing fundamentally changes. 
Unprofitable stores are closing, so the losses will be much smaller. They might even be profitable soon.
So buy more GME? Got it, thanks!

Selling shortly after earnings
Total account balance. You can manually meet the requirements by depositing more money or selling some positions, which will increase your account balance or reduce your maintenance requirements. If you take too long or really fuck up, they will liquidate whatever the fuck they want to cover the discrepancy. 

Different stocks have different maintenance requirements. High volatility or uncertainty requires higher maintenance than something that barely moves.

There’s been some news/rumors that GME shares cannot be traded on margin anymore. I have no idea if this is true for retail on RH or how it affects holding like 100 shares on margin already, or if it’s just for shorts so that brokerages don’t get fucked. Money is fungible though, so even if they suddenly require your GME to be 100% “cash”, they’ll just switch more of your PLTR position to be “on margin” automatically. So long as your new maintenance requirement is the same or lower as your original (PLTR is 25% on RH right now), you won’t get a margin call because nothing about your portfolio will have really changed. If you’re 100% all in on GME including 100% of available margin, and GME’s margin requirements change, then they will either ask for more cash deposit or liquidate your GME position until it is compliant.

OP is a student with 125 shares, I think if this isn't enough to throw your life savings into GME nothing is.
I bought 10 when it dipped couple weeks ago, I expect a run up til earnings
At least they report factual information unlike Fox, Newsmax and OANN
But sir this is a wendys
Me hopes. Got assigned on a CSP at 32. But that was the plan. Sell a put to get the shares. Hope it pays off.
YOU ARE WELCOME BB
Anyone expecting anything special out of earnings? Unexpected huge beats? Splits? Anything
Oh fuck that would be GOLD
More of an implosion and settles back around $23.

“This isn’t even factoring in a complete turnaround that RC has to be planning. Look at the newest board composition. Newest members are Reggie (my body is ready), the head of cloud 9 esports, and the current president Petsmart and Chewy. board member. Ask yourself, are these the people that would join the board of a company that is expected to die in 5 years due to digital game sales.”

Pretty much this. Just because you change up the board doesn’t mean success of course, but certainly does signal a new way of thinking and plans for the future. 

Thanks for the write up. I’m buying another 500 shares on Tuesday, a drop in the bucket but it’s a start.
Finna play Guitar Hero 3 till I can five star Knights of Cydonia on Expert, song is cool as shit 😤😤😤
SEC will b contacted by RC lawyers & will force these funds to cover imho he is fully aware of what these funds r up to & lending more & more shorts out is criminally insane. Regardless since GME has value sep from a squeeze.

I saw a suggestion for 100% by end of day Tuesday in hopes for dip. Maybe 20% in the morning and gauge. Then at least 40% by afternoon and the remainder before close if trend allows
This sub runs in cycles:
-Someone posts DD and people make fun of them
-The DD turns out to be true and the stock shoots up
-Retards buy the top and start shilling over the weekend
-The stock pullsback and we cycle into another meme

I heard a couple of people saying that gme might do another secondary offering for additional funds but it didn't make any sense to me as why would they shoot themselves in the foot. That worry was the only thing keeping a couple of my friends out of the stock while I bought another 2 calls after seeing the pullback on Friday.

Kudos on the depth and some new insights! I was wondering, is it ok to buy GME stocks at a European stock-enchange tomorrow, like Frankfurt? Or is there somehow a possibility these stocks are outside of the squeeze? Or maybe there aren't many stocks available to buy outside of USA market?

People comparing this to the Volkswagen squeeze are wrong, VW float was at like 1000%. I would be interested if anyone knows what the float was for other squeezes like Beyond meat, Overstock etc
Well.. it accumulates every year. So for example if I had not used any of mine I would be over $70,000 in contribution at the age of 30... Some years it was $10,000 some years it was $5,000... However, whatever you make in the account is fair game. So if you yolo 20k into 400k then you could potentially have millions in the account accumulating tax free and you can take it out tax free as well.

Great write up... I’ve been watching GME closely for awhile thanks to this sub, and have about 25% of my portfolio invested. I’m getting more and more on board with the value here even without an epic squeeze. The massive amount of short volume alone has suppressed the share price, add in a Cohen turnaround and a possible all time squeeze and it becomes more and more apparent that this is a great play. I keep reading legitimate bull theses like this one and I havent heard anything of any value or substance on the bear side. Just “blockbuster” and “who buys games” and “when’s the last time you went to GameStop”. It seems all signs are pointing up for GME and the opportunity to make money and fuck the big guys is something we should all want to be a part of.
I heard fasting is healthy.

Okay. I'm retarded and need input because stupid. I have about $1000 capital right now (from the $100 I started with, thanks to you beautiful retards). Seeing that I could only purchase about 25ish shares give or take how Tuesday goes, would it be more profitable for me short term to buy a call option a few months out, ride that to Pluto during the MOASS, and then reinvest into GME shares since I would theoretically have more capital after the squeeze?

I FOMOed into one share of TTD at the top too, that was a steep drop, still hasn't recovered yet.
Yeah. I’m a 30+ yr Chiefs fan. Mahomes is vindication for all the years we had Bill Kenny and other crap quarterbacks. Nick Lowry was our best player back in the day! 😂

I have friends from Ohio. They’re super excited right now too. Most excited since the Lebron days. 

It was unfortunate that Johnny Football didn’t pan out for you guys a few years back. 

But yes, Mahomes is the new Tom Brady. Guy is soo damn talented. And he’s prolly the most down to Earth QB since Peyton Manning. Gonna be a force for the next decade and really fun to watch. 

Hope the Browns give a good game and keep it up next year. I bet Budweiser doesn’t have those fridges full of free beer around town anymore for if they win! 😂

Why are we not letting the newbs know that they should buy PLTR 2022 20 Calls and Sell 2022 50 Calls?  
It's a completely safe move that locks them into a $2,345 gain for every bundle bought/sold.  
It also prevents them from being able to nuke their account for a whole year and still returns a shit ton so they have massive gains to play with?  


It's basic training wheels for our baby autismos.

Fantastic work, one of the few good DD posts on this stock in the past week (too many people - bulls and bears - with no other posts or karma pumping out braindead, bad, weak, or stolen takes)!  

I joined GME gang ~mid Nov. By Christmas time, I realized how much value there was in this thing without a MOASS. If the MOASS does happen, I'll obviously try and lock in some gains at the "top" but as soon as a pullback occurs I'd rebuild my position - anything between 40 - 60 will look cheap within 2 years, anything below would be incredible. 25B Cap by EOY2023 is well within the reasonable bullish end to me and that's ~$315. From there its difficult to see but I'd wager that gaming industry is going nowhere except towards growth and if a visionary like Cohen is still aboard, GameStop will capitalize.

Our biggest unknown here is the true SI at this moment in time, but the S3 and Ortex data (even with error bars) gives promising signs. And since I (and most in this for the Fundamentals) are in for owned shares anyway, the MOASS isn't make/break.

Idiot
Isn’t BBBY expected to short squeeze?  72% short float or something?
For any new people to BB, I am bullish BB, but feel you should know a little more before yoloing your life savings into this stock.

This is a LONG hold. This is not a squeeze scenario that will pop how GME did. If you're looking for the next GME, you need to do some research and realize that may be a long time coming.

In the tiniest of oversimplified explanations, BB looks good on paper right now because of one time patent sales and licensing profits they realize to offset some pretty heavy operation expenses. BB is in a transitionary period since it was, and still is seen this way, a hardware company. Now as a software company, they bought a start-up in Cylance 2 years ago and have now merged their software with Cylance to create Cyber Suite and are getting some sweet contracts. They have partnered with Amazon's AWS to help them develop IVY which is the smart software for vehicles that won't see any revenue till mid 2022 at the earliest. They also have QNX which is actually a stronghold of theirs right now currently generating revenue that can see some great growth as they are in roughly 60% of the EV market. HOWEVER......THIS IS A LONG HOLD. If you're looking for some FD's, fuk outta ere because you'll most likely lose your money. Otherwise, it may get a little volatile right now as we've seen over the last couple of weeks due to the dampening from Q3 earnings and now the rise due to all the presentations. These presentations are all reiterating what I stated above, but for whatever reason, you tards think this means rockets now.

Anywho, be smart with your money. Still a good investment, but a long term investment.

Edit: to let you know I hold 400 shares at 7.50 and $5 calls at $4 a pop for 2023. I personally am thinking about selling my shares and just going deeper into these 2023 calls as those babies will print hard even at these current prices. Just need patience.
Ok so there’s a ton of scams that go on in Florida especially south Florida/miami. They have fake sunglasses stores, fake doctors offices, medical fraud, Medicare fraud, social security fraud, the last governor of Florida made 300 million off of essentially the biggest healthcare scam ever. I don’t trust a Miami car dealership
If PLTR has even the tiniest gap up Tuesday my spreads are immediately becoming GME shares don't even cash me out just transfer. I want my paycheck in GME shares  at the highest bid.
Wait what. I’m not in any margin you dumb robot

Another offering could be very bullish. This gives Ryan Cohen free financing to turn GME around.

The biggest risk is Cohen getting paid off by Melvin or dying.
I’m sure this is expected. Europeans will tend stick to their car brands. You don’t see Fords or Chevrolets over there

Fine.  I will YOLO into GME on Tuesday
You can't.  Any cash deposited to an account with a margin balance will automatically be credited to the balance owed.  Either deposit enough cash or liquidate securities to cover the margin balance.

Using the shelf offering is kind of bearish as they could give those shares straight to the shorts. I think big money will find a way to back out of this whilst fuckin us little guys.

No, you’re seeing these posts about GME margin call because the shorts are having to cover. If you’re portfolio value (securities+cash) stay above your margin maintenance you will not be margin called. And to answer your question below, normally when you are margin called you will have several days to either deposit more money or choose which positions to liquidate. However, I’ve never gotten a call so I don’t know exactly how it works with Robinhood

If I had that level of skill I’d be in politics. I’m not. And one good meme post causes more buying than anything. You also can draw bullish theories here like ‘omg guys if we push this to 38 it’ll ramp to 42 easy’ then ‘let’s get this to 49 so it ramps to 51/52 fast.’

Most of my positions atm are long index calls, huge positions in fate and a banned ticker that contains a lot of pre ipo companies and PLTR, an incredibly dumb UK pence stock, and long calls on well and vtr.

Pretty much everything you see on the internet is information that was paid for by someone who wanted you to see it so they gain. In news articles it’s less common but it definitely happens and won’t be “illegal” unless they’re blatantly overt about it. They’ll just claim they were reporting factual information.
Shares and avg down when your wrong. 

The only choice in options is to diamond hands that bitch til she goes up. Like my current 3/19 MP 50c, down 30% and bought on a peak. 

Shares are easier tho.
I’m bag holding 200 SOLO shares I bought at the highest peak of 13 something.  I avg’d down to about 10. Gonna drop a few more bands to get it lower then sell out for no significant loss. I’ve also contemplated selling covered calls until it hits or I recover. I think I understand covered calls but not confident enough.

I'm pretty sure I understand the concept -- RH is lending you additional capital against the value of your portfolio. If the value of your securities increases, the amount they extend you goes up; if the securities decrease, then they recall some of their extended capital in a margin call. Got it. 

I guess my question is (and I'll admit it was unclear): can you get margin called simply for owning a specific stock, such as GME (wherein institutional shorts will be grasping at whatever shares they can find)?

Hey ameritards, I was sent as an ambassador for the international markets. We just want to inform you that we will buy like crazy tomorrow so you will start on Tuesday with a nice gap up.
We need more fucking anime in this sub. It’s the only way.
Trump is selling pardons, what do you guys think we can buy from him? A nuke?
Basically you can’t day trade, trade on margins, and other “risky” trading practices. IRAs are meant to be “safe” retirement accounts and the IRS and brokerages have rules that discourage YOLOing your IRA. 

Take a look at this article:

https://finance.zacks.com/rules-trading-stocks-ira-account-4427.html
Isn’t that the stock market in a nutshell?
Make one using this video please. I think it would suit well, I just don’t know how to make them. https://youtu.be/WdxP-I0_D84
The reason I’m not a fan of this at all it’s because you’re talking about pattern recognition regarding something that hasn’t happened before. This will be the first infinite GME short squeeze and I don’t see how any past patterns could help indicate when this new, unique thing will begin.
I like your funny words magic man
god i hope so, funds are still in transit

Anyone else holding GME for more than just the short squeeze? I believe there's a long term future with RC at the helm
Checked, same voice actor, Eric Stuart. Mind fucking blown.
This DD seemed to me as just trying to sound smart without much substance. But OP was addressing questions here politely, though his answers again sounded like doublespeak. Did some DD on OP, and from his comment history it is clear that a few days back he was extremely bearish on GME and trolling the GME longs left and right. Now that GME has had a great run the past week, there is a sudden change in tone. Since nobody is going to take any heavily bearish opinions seriously giving the events of the past couple of days, I feel that these posts are meant to slowly swing WSB sentiment with the changed tone.
The best confirmation bias I’ve ever read

Behaviour of a few retards doesn't define the behaviour of the whole sub
Why not split your order in half. That way if the price dips you can take advantage
Correct. Read up a bit it'll potentially save you thousands. Our traditional IRA is pretax contributions- the money you put in reduces your taxes on the front end. Roth IRA, you pay taxes on the contributions but don't have to pay on withdrawals later. Both of them, no taxes on gains made from trades made within the IRA. So Roth is probably the best for if you plan on making lots of tendies- contributions are made with after tax funds but then you don't pay taxes on the profits from trades or the withdrawals (when made after retirement age etc.) there's a lot of devil in the details about it but that is the gist.

What are the chances GME does a raise at these new price levels before shorts cover?
Now this I agree with
This was awesome! But can I ask you what you think of that bears post about what he said of holding options? And how the more ITM it is the person holding it is more likely to get squeezed or whatever the fuck he said? I’ve been holding a lot of them, April’s and July’s since the price of gme was $15
Define cheap. Is it less than $5? Also what's it's market cap?
Yup.
I guess 21k in GME tuesday

Buy half first and then save half till an inevitable dip
What gen M3? Used to have an E36 but GME might make it an F80. Also thoughts on plates being M3LV1N to match?
hahahah it was so supposed to fully enclosed side by side and now that POS doesn't have doors.

On the contrary I think the squeeze will happen because 🚀🚀🚀 shorts cover Tuesday we go to the moon. Plus literally every retard bought shares with whatever money they could and whatever they could borrow from their parents. We have to own a shit ton of GameStop so if we all just hold it won’t drop
Started following this company "Foresight Autonomous" (FRSX) last week because auto driving technology seems like a good bet right now, and its a cheap stock.

 It ended up rising 20% on Friday with like twice the average volume and no news. What gives?

WSB being right about the squeeze is like a group of ants stealing a giants toenail in his sleep and victoriously dragging it back to the anthill where it will feed a generation.
What’s her onlyfans
If you’re really that insistent on buying calls, buy April or Jul 45-55c range. Do it.
Well shit. Now I need to cut a bunch of my SPACs to free up margin which I may have used for GME. Thank you for the rockets, that's how I know I can trust this post.
Went from slowly investing in dividend stocks to throwing thousands of dollars into TSLA, GME, ARKG and PLTR. Having way more fun and making more money. Thanks retards
I think it depends on if shorts rush the exits or if we see a slow burn like the Tesla squeeze.


A contributing factor to Tesla’s sustained price is autist retail investors holding shares because they believe in Elon and the future of Tesla. Obviously GameStop isn’t Tesla but with Cohen at the helm I’m comfortable holding shares regardless of a squeeze.
So GME is a buy?
I have the some positions but long calls because I’m too poor to make profits off of shares

and after earnings? 😔
I took all my money out of index funds to invest all in individual stocks. 18% last year is great for index funds, but I WANT MOARRRR.

If there's a severe market crash, index funds won't 'save' me either, I'll have A LOT of things to worry about (world stability, depression incoming, etc.) If there is a down market, I'll still rather have money to put into stocks that may do well rather than a bunch of companies that are dead weight in the S&P.

I'll rather take my chances in order to retire easier...if not, I'll be working until 60 anyways.

Yea I mean, we’re saying the same thing really. I’m saying that point number 3 is stupid and that there is no such thing as “overvalued” in this market. There’s simply the value that people think it’s worth, period and tons of companies are worth a looooot simply cause they are popular.
That's what I like to hear.

Why does everyone on r/SPAC’s and r/Wallstreetbets feel they need to do a post to threaten to leave if they don’t like the content or announce they are leaving. 

If you aren’t interested in this stuff that’s fine, just go. We don’t need a speech about it. I see so many of these posts and it is just annoying. 

You don’t need to announce when you are leaving if nobody knew you were even here.
Market in USA be closed Monday. So we need our foreign market traders to do their part!
Lol I literally have 10K in shares and have been posting about GME these last few days?

Bitch bout to lose his shirt.
I think another important bit of info that I didn’t see you mention, and I feel would be helpful to the newcomers who ask if it’s too late to join, is days to cover. Marketbeat’s most recent report estimated that it would take 6 days, **6 fucking days**,  for shorts to cover their positions.


So anyone who’s worried that they might miss out on profits if/when the squeeze happens, you would literally have to not have checked your broker for a full trading week, which let’s be honest if you’re in on GME at this point—you’re checking every fucking day.

Boo. Only drop it in options or go for gme or BB shares. Anything else is a bitch move. You a chad or a little bitch?
I'm not against gme or pltr or whatever, but can we start getting some real dd in on new companies? I haven't found a good new pick from wsb in like a month now
I mean, if it goes to 15, surely many shorts will be bought back.
Going to yolo at lot of money at NIO at open
In regards to GME, will there be a way of knowing when the squeeze has peaked? Should I sell as soon as I see a slight decline from the top? 
Also, I see a lot of people have their sell-limit at $420.69, but I put mine at $600. Could my stocks possibly never be bought by the shorties if it’s a higher price than most listings?
Name definitely checks out
GME gonna make you feel stupid for thinking you ever had to go to school
They get promised free tendies.

What the hell are you talking about?🤣 PLTR? What?
Stage 5 is profit duhhhh
Move it slowly.
Well the shorts are the catalysts for wsb joining the fight. But the catalysts for a squeeze are sentiment around GME’s turnaround and execution by Cohen. Price alone is only scaring the intraday shorts. Sherman is a resilient bitch.

Terrible for options, all their IV is pre-earnings.
Anyone with half a brain would buy a call option for every 100 shares sold short to limit the loss in case SHTF. That's why they can diamond hand for so long.
Too much hype in WSB. Calm down. I predict it will go sideways next week.
The below part mention above reverse merger and acquisition part mention upcoming event. 

Pitchbook is highly accredited with great sources. They knew about the Tokopedia merger acquisition with Gojek before the public knew.

No, GME is a value play. The shorts made it cheaper than it should have been.
right...or alternative "well, its not gonna suck itself"
Thanks!
You should be concerned if that's true
The price rocket was institutionals finally reacting to Cohen and some panic covering. If wsb actually held until a squeeze and sold into mass covering it wouldn’t stop momentum either. Love wsb and the diamond handing stabilizes the price but it’s not the end all. Sentiment around Cohen is driving this ship.
Amen, this blows

Fantastic. Even worse.

I heard buying stocks after a 2,000% run is smart, and at a 783B market cap 😂. Unreal
At a 40 billion market cap, the share price would be $571/share. They say gaming is a far bigger market.  If we only squeeze up to $420.69, let alone $299, It’s not worthy of the MOASS title.

It probably won't hit $1K for 10 years. Top is in already and it will sell-off back to the 200s. I strongly recommend getting out now. It's going to take a long time for fundamentals to grow to warrant a price at 1000 or even back to where we are now

I'm following GME since last sept. so I'm more or less familiar with the case. But yeah, at the current state you should be OK with buying shares (Sell CSP's and get assigned - GME has weekly options). 

Stonks go up. 

PS: This is no financial advise.
CLE too low on that list
IMOP with earnings coming in the next 2-3 weeks the best plays in the market right now are FB, V, MA, AMD,  MSFT, SNAP and Apple. All on the oversold side of RSI and coming in underpriced into earnings.
As long as you are 100% equity; if everything you’ve purchased has been with your own money and not via borrowed money from your broker (“on margin”) you are fine.

I think Burry noticed retail piling in and pulled back dry powder (38%?) for the purpose of forcing the squeeze.
I don’t think so for me. I think greed will always have the best of us and that fear of loss will keep us wanting to gain more in hopes of securing a safety net for when those loss days happen. I think even at 1000% I’ll still be messing around here.

I get it though. Id love to see capitalism work in a way that was promised. That corporations be held responsible by the sway of the free market. And that greater general utility results in terms of change benefitting more if not all stakeholders. But until the stakeholders and the shareholders align in their ideals the only thing anyone can do is to build capital and if theyre idealistically benevolent enough, attempt to push reality in the said direction.

yea but look at the chart man.. needs a long rest
Yes. The persistence of the short interest. Retail doesn’t diamond hand a short this bad this long in aggregate.
This is gold
When is merger?
The narrative is in two parts. The problem is that there is only one price. If 5% of the shares really are WSB that pumping is a very real part of the price and so it will unwind at some point. You can't all leave at the same time but you can't all hold forever either to keep the price up so the bet is thus:

The value of the other factors has to be worth significantly more than the value of the WSB interest. And at this time ... I doubt it.
When you do, get the path integral book by Feynman and Hibbs, it saved my ass doing my homework sets in graduate quantum mechanics.

Do you have evidence that most short positions are held by institutions rather than retail investors?
Who cares? I don't think we should get to a point where we bully people out of trades. This for me is nothing compared to all the hit pieces being published this week by assholes who see the position and don't accurately frame both sides...
Been sitting on 8c 4/16 calls for a while. Want to be 100% sure with the merger before I make my next move
To think about Friday, 10% pull back in the context of an overall red market and a fucking 100% appreciation is practically an up day.
is it tho
I'm the same to be honest. My portfolio went up 200% in 3 months and I still got pissed when a red day reduced it to "only" 180%.

I think this is something that comes with time and experience.
You get me.

I like the part where you said "STONK ONLY GOES UP"
There are a lot of moves going on. That’s a fact, RC is heavily invested and not selling. A true believer. 

GME is heavily shorted that too is a fact. 

They had enough cash on hand to take it private last year, also a fact showing good financial health and it being severely undervalued. Another fact. 

Funds limit exposure so have to sell if there’s a sharp increase as to not tank their funds if it crashes. Fact. 

This is all fundamentally sound

Nice, great gains. I wish I had strengthened my position a few weeks ago. I will surely exercise my option with APHA instead of selling it for the reasons mentioned in this post.
Any thoughts on good price point this week to buy at? I know it’s going to be volatile but what levels do you think it could dip?

**[Loss aversion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loss aversion)**

Loss aversion is the tendency to prefer avoiding losses to acquiring equivalent gains. The principle is prominent in the domain of economics. What distinguishes loss aversion from risk aversion is that the utility of a monetary payoff depends on what was previously experienced or was expected to happen. Some studies have suggested that losses are twice as powerful, psychologically, as gains.

What did you discover?
When GME shorts don’t realize that there’s gonna be additional buying power with upcoming $1400 check equivalent to 40 shares per person. Multiply 40 shares by the number of half of WSB members (500k conservative estimate*).. at least 20 million shares gonna be purchased... good luck shorts.. 🚀🚀🚀

I believe this fall into the category of an all stock merger and would follow the rules below. This is from Pocket Sense. I have never owned a leap that went through a merger so new to this as well. 

## All-Stock Offer

With an all-stock merger, the number of shares covered by a call option is changed to adjust for the value of the buyout. The options on the bought-out company will change to options on the buyer stock at the same strike price, but for a different number of shares. Normally, one option is for 100 shares of the underlying stock. For example, company A buys company B, exchanging 1/2 share of A for each share of B. Options purchased on company B stock would change to options on company A, with 50 shares of stock delivered if the option is exercised.

These firms can never accept responsibility, they do not understand the modern world, what people value, or what type of companies are the future, the young consumers do.  Its hilarious the mental gymnastics to avoid accepting they are out of touch and should be focusing on hiring younger people more in touch with the modern market rather than bitching about how stupid young people are.

That graph does look like a pair of tits, I'll give you that.
In all seriousness, thank you! This was extremely informative. . It's  worrisome how much of their profitability is getting tanked by honestly outrageous salaries/ pay outs to heads of co. My question to you is simple. What do you believe is their chance of pivoting into commercial/ consumer applications. Imagine if company's started using them to predict sales and streamline acquisition. Theres alot of companies that already do this, but ease of use and a different pricing structure (perhaps like a subscription method) could raise their share of the pie astronomically. I dont know shit about this but to me it seems if they do persue this, their valuation could skyrocket and be less dependent on our uhh not very stable government contracts. I honestly dont want to invest in something tied to military contracts exclusively because our political climate is incredibly volatile. Also I would hate to be in the position where i would be hoping for increased military intervention or instability in the world to drive the price up.

Tldr. I dont want my 🚀🚀🚀 tied to actual 🚀🚀🚀 explosions
I’m not sure how to approach the actual squeeze, I’ll probably end up holding just a little too long but in any case, I should end up with far more than I have today.

Trying to convince my friends and family members to take their money out of a 0.25% interest rate savings account and put it into a broad index fund, the responses were soul destroying... 

It's amazing the fear some people have about losing their money. Which is ironic because they're losing money due to inflation anyway, the interest rate doesn't even keep on par with inflation... They have this weird nonsensical idea that stock market = bad / high risk / lose your life savings. 


They're convinced the moment they invest the market will crash 90% and they will lose everything. Nothing I've said to them will convince them otherwise :/ Pretty sad to be honest. 

I've explained buying consistently each and every month, I've explained reinvesting dividends and I've explained the tax benefits. 

I'm at a loss. Then they act all surprised how my net worth is 10x theirs despite us all having similar salary jobs.

so what's your target price, mate?
Your 🐻 sacrifice is inspiring

I read everything and really, thank you for this. I don't care if $GME goes to fucking 10$ tuesday, i'll just get more shares to get to the fucking moon, squeeze or not. I'm a patient fellow, those diamond hands will make us some serious money, the bears are so fucked, i feel like i'm watching history unfolds here

APHA is merging into TLRY. They will become the same company. All shares of APHA will convert into 0.8whatever shares of TLRY. At the current strike prices of the two, you get more future shares of TLRY if you buy APHA right now. So as soon as the merger is complete, you’ll instantly have gains, as long as the TLRY doesn’t go down obviously. 

If you still don’t get it, APHA = 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

He'll be back.
I haven’t done too many tbh mostly just ICLN and AAPL which I’ve generally been successful on so far and then I lost some money on DKNG after it stayed pretty stagnant at $50. I’d say with those calls your upside can still be like 50-200% but you won’t necessarily lose your full investment since at least you’re ITM if it stays flat and if you don’t feel confident you can sell a bit early before Theta fucks you
But im not in California
That’s retarded
Smooth brain talk
Damn. Im not RC but being RC would be kinda based now

Where can I learn to actually understand what the fuck any of this means? Any book recommendations  or something of the like?

NICE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Diamond HAAAANDS. Wait, sounds an awful lot like buy and hold. 100 GME at 19 because I had to give all the rest of my money to the 2020 tax man.
You sound insecure
Thats you decision. I am strongly of the belief GME will moon
You sound insecure
You sound insecure
fuck I lost the powerball again I'm so bad at everything 😩😩
You sound insecure
How do you store them? Any temperature recommendations?
You know how so many people preach like cut your losses, but from what I've learned is that if you invest in a solid company and even if ur calls are down like 80%, if you diamond hand it, you can recoup your losses or even make a profit. I paper handed my shit way too much and lost way too much money like that. From now, I'm just diamond handing and buying LEAPS, so that I don't need to worry about if my calls fall 80% in a week, I have 300+ more days. Good luck to you, but I would highly suggest avoiding weeklies unless you're totally okay losing 100% of ur money. Also, it helps not checking robinhood every minute of the day. When shit gets rough, I just minimize or watch something, fap one out, work out, etc (aka like last friday).
Sir we only lose money

You really think that was the start if a crash? Seem like just another wild OPEX to me, but ok. Guess i will sell everything now
FANTASTIC DD. I'm sad youre only in for that many shares you deserve to profit more! I see you put a price target of 299. How much do you think wsb paper-handed bitches could drop the price, because I really don't expect a lot of them to hold. 200-299?
Yes because you are clearly more experienced. Anyone in GME clearly has no idea what they’re doing and have never lost much money before. Stop with the superiority complex.
[deleted]
What’s funny is they think some 🏳️‍🌈🐻articles will scare us off.  People in this sub yolo their entire accounts on long shot FDs in pre-revenue SPACs.  Fear doesn’t come to this sub.
Sounds great but the average autist can’t afford naked calls AMZN. Telling them to do debit spreads is a lot to ask, so I dont’t know if there’d be full wsb support to back that pump... then again, it’s amzn so that’s just good dd.

What happens to long apha calls through the merger? Just an uptick in value?

Lol remember ACB and Coke, amazing people thought that was real.
I've got $420.69, $694.20, and $999.
I’m long but I’m hoping i can time the top of the squeeze so I can buy even more shares afterwards with the profits

Good shit my man!
Right. What I’m saying is flash crash kid was doing something illegal and a dumb kid. OP would be doing something not illegal(although would appear sus at first glance) and is a dumb kid. 

This, nothing would come of it...
How about not shilling something at it's ATH?
There’s always money in the banana stand.
I want GME to moon next week but the memes on here when it comes crashing down will be fantastic 🤔
So many bears come out over the weekend, especially night before open. Can’t wait for Tuesday so they can go back to crying in the corner and saying it’s all rigged.
Good bot
Yes this is exactly what we need to do!
That's perfect, well done OP 👏👌
If inflation is coming, you guys better move out of the high cost of living cities. Inflation = higher tax brackets for everyone because the tiny adjustments the IRS does each year won't keep up. 

You guys will end up in the **65% tax bracket** = 37% Federal Tax + 3.8% Net Investment Income Tax + 1% Medicare surcharge + 12.3% California Income Tax + 1% Disability Insurance Tax + 10% IBR
*sigh* alright I guess you'll all have to learn the hard way lol
Merrimac, gold coast, australia.
Doesn’t work like that
Should I sell all my TSLA for GME for now?
I wonder if lending your shares makes the squeeze even higher... Might take longer but is this the case?
Oh I know. I bought those with utter conviction and confidence, albeit definitely an impulse buy. But the constant stress and anxiety got to me. When you emotion-bought weeklies with most of the money you have, you can really get inside your head about it.
This is the way
And then lost it all trying to predict the second crash. Also, this assumes that anyone was actually holding puts before the actual crash and iv was through the roof
Doubt

I don’t see enough people talk about CC👁V Do yous not thing it’s a good investment ?
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HOW HE IS EVEN POPULAR IN THE FIRST PLACE.
The kiosk arent announced and thats what your not getting your just saying it but its not official, thats like me saying tesla is making jets, we know its coming but it isnt announced so it doesnt affect their stock price. I didnt say game stop is going back to $4, they have revenue they wont go bankrupt, but its a losing business. They arent valued at 50 or 100 is all im  saying, so you guys in it for it go to 100 next week are retards my guy thats all im saying. Take your profits bro, the market is pulling back for the run before summer. Take my advice.
Sell high buy higher, I like your strategy.
I just dropped in $200, the fuck did I do?

TIL market is closed tomorrow🤡🤡, theta gang gets a free day to munch on my stupidity.

No. That's not thinking big enough. He probably mortgaged the tits out of that house to keep his shorts going for longer. So you go to his bank, put down a suitcase filled with GME shares and tell them it's your final offer. You now own the bank that Melvin owes money to. Then when he defaults on his mortgage you'll personally come over to inspect your new property and then, to celebrate this acquisition of his assets, you bang his wife in your new bedroom.

Happy to give back. I learned a lot following GME and all hype around it on wsb.
Any luck profit wise? Like do u see 100% gains? I’m curious because I was addicted to FD’s
You mean Barron’s made it to WSB
🥺☺️
At my job, I have about 50 employees under me. Id say two of them have what it takes to move up out of labor. Even then, I’m going to have to press them to take promotional tests or they just won’t do it. Basically sign them up and make sure they actually show. 

I’ve got less than 10 who actually care and are responsible and competent, however they don’t have what it takes to make it out of labor, they fail tests, even easy ones that they take every year with the same questions... they couldn’t do the work if they don’t have reading comprehension. The reality is more than half of all of us are incompetent. Can’t get a task completed without someone walking us through it. More than half won’t own up to their mistakes, which means they can’t learn from them or improve. 

However, while I agree with you that most people don’t actually want it, even if they say they do... there’s still issues with the over all structures of business in America. People aren’t motivated to improve themselves, and their jobs generally only make it worse. I try to be better, but I have to follow guidelines myself. Hoepfully one day we can effect some real change, but it has to start with a populace that truly desires it.
You forgot about not allowing brokers to lend you shares other wise Melvin can keep this fight longer

Well “technically” I’m not down. I sold the pop on 1/05 and repositioned into “better” positions and after averaging them down every week since then most hit -30 to -45% Friday 🙃
99% certainty $BB will be at $20 by Feb. Earning coming out too. Could be $30 bull case by mid Feb if us retards start pumping that shit harder than grandma pumps grandpas dick.

The only thing my confirmation bias doesn't like is how every post is discussing different high price. Your post mentions 200$ witohut squeeze, another post mentions \~530USD with a "moderate-hig level squeeze" then there are people who talk about 100$ (but honestly those might be some invalids smoking meth).
You guys think Mr.Beast is gonna completely flop in a few years like other youtubers do? Like he gets a TV show, it flops, his channel becomes neglected, his friends leave him and he goes crazy.

There is a notable advantage that bulls have over bears...

A bear selling a call option is exposed to unlimited losses. No upper bound!

A bull selling a put option has a ceiling for his losses. (Only oil can go negative price, not GME.)

A bear buying a put option has a ceiling for his gains.

A bull buying a call option has no upper limit for his gains. (Non-zero chance on moon.)

These people "buying the dip" on stocks like GME and Tesla are going to be so screwed when the stock continues to freefall. Both will experience atleast 60-70% selloffs during the next market crash. Which may have already started last Thursday
TFC players rise up!
How to 10x though
Barron’s had an even more extensive negative article on GME recently. Above the headline was a huge picture of a rundown GameStop with a broken sign. It was like a Brietbart article if they ran a find-and-replace command to swap “minorities” with “GameStop.” My father in law showed it to me, cautioning my conviction. I laughed inwardly.

First ones free, kid.
I am not sure if you read the press release but it is scheduled to close on or around January 19. So ongoing for one more business day I guess. I am not an expert but my understanding is that these are the last of the shares from this shelf so not additional direct offerings planned at this point which is good. I agree it has risen 340% year to date but not sure how relevant that is at this point due to significant increased institutional and investor interest in this sector. We could have said the same thing about PLUG in August when it was at $13.  I am sure there are a lot who agree with you but just my two cents anyway. I think the future is bright here so !remindme in two months. Best of luck!

the entire chart would be replaced by 2 buttons. One with the rocket emoji the other is the gay bear.

If GameStop shifts focus to primarily gaming PC building, parts, accessories, then it can adapt to the future.

 FIT is a shit stock better go up
Appreciate your post! I'm newbie and luckily could afford 50 shares at 18.35. What is my most reasonable play? My plan is

Set limit to sell 20 at 100, 20 at 200 and 10 at 300. I will hold until then.
[Teach Me](https://youtu.be/VhZ_4slI6xA?t=29)
That's it!

Imagine literally being handed a winning lotto ticket just for finding wsb and believing in the dream. This is GME. I'm so thankful

That’s amazing! I was worried🥲
Sir this a very shitty down-market gambling den where we only bet on absolute dog shit in hopes of a short squeeze

Edit: in fact I am surprised we haven't seen an uptick of idiots ~~shilling~~ talking about pennyshti

I’m being cautious. I don’t think GME will take off in the next week because everyone and cramers grandmother is watching it. On the other hand, I think BB is the play.
She's really lucky to have you
Well it's powerfull alright, but really dificult to control. Who knows where the 'tards are throwing their tendy money at in a month or two? But yeah, the Power of the stupid masses truly is something to behold.

No way apple hits 140 before/after earnings.

yo need some confirmation bias for ICLN so i can sleep well because it‘s 70% of my portfolio thanks
I see a few great qualities in Xpeng such as them having two of their own manufacturing facilities and being hyper focused on smart EVs in the low to middle range affordability market. I see them being a more rewarding but more risky option than Nio...that’s why I own them over Nio. I also don’t love the “Battery as a service” option Nio offers. It feels too customizable and may require too much operational side stepping vs focusing on the main “meal” if you will. 

I also think Nio is valued at where Xpeng will be valued in 12 months give or take so I’d rather stick with Xpeng and ride the growth! Also, Xpeng shadowing some design and tech of Tesla’s imo is a good thing. I think Tesla who I also hold is a light year ahead so why not follow in Tesla’s foot steps till they know their own!
Dumb bitch shoulda left them inside

GME 🚀🚀🚀
So say I buy a 50c for 22. The call goes itm in a few months. Do I exercise it then and there to get those shares or wait longer? How do investors typically exercise leaps? Also wouldn’t I just want to get like a 20c for 22 and then exercise that down the line? Wouldn’t you want a lower strike if you are planning to exercise it?
I would have gotten away with it too if it wasn't for you meddling kids
This place is getting worse everyday
Wow... sorry to see this. That flat line is like your pulse...
3/19 7c 💪
Paper stomach
Yeah that's what's got me worried. I threw some calls into BB since I'm hearing rumbles there. I may pick up the 10 stocks in GME now, sell and see how we are all feeling at the end of the week. Maybe pick up a GME call then
When you were bammed, how long you were banmed in days and how many times youve been banned
Yeah that’s what I thought about a lot of companies like hertz before the gov decided to spend 5T of everyone’s grandkids money to prop all these dumpster fires up, then you get a cult following and you can have 1500 PE ratios for no reason
I'm a bot. Recent empty self posts, noob questions, and spam which people were temp-banned for. Bans are 1-2 days to discourage posts that ought to be comments.

Yes, this is true. The impact is that their orders only get filled on up-momentum. Before the "up-tick" rule goes into effect they can sell at the bid price, fill all the bids, and then sell at the next highest bid price. This can aggressively wipe out the bidders and drive the price down.

‘Some interesting stats for $amzn🚀:

1. Analyst Rev Estimates: 
20: 380B
21: 449B
22: 525B
Rev Cagr of 18%

$amzn currently trades at 3x 22 revs.

2. Eps estimates:
20: $35
21: $45
22: $60

$amzn currently trades at 51 PE to 22 EPS.

3. free cash flow:
20: 26B
21: 44B!
22: 55B

20 was a huge investment yr for $amzn given covid expenses, new warehouses for capacity, & new hires needed due to pandemic. what people are missing is that they wont need to invest this much going forward & will reap massive CF in 21.

Current q estimated 120B in rev w/ EPS of 7.12. Meanwhile in previous non holiday q they had 95B in rev w/ eps of 12.37 (expected was 7.41). Can $amzn really make less this q off an extra 25B in rev (which they’ll likely beat) than last q? What if eps is something like $15-20?!

$amzn will have spent 12B on covid expenses in 2020 which will eventually flows back to bottom line post covid. Given surging cases I can see $amzn guide for much higher covid expenses next q, maybe 6-8B which might be biggest risk for stock with next q revs at 95B but its temp.

I think $amzn revs hit 124B & EPS of $17 this q which would be a huge blowout. Biggest thing ppl will watch is AWS which grew just 29% last q if it can accelerate & adv biz which grew 50% last q & is now 1/4 the size of all $fb revs with high margins like aws. Earnings in 2 weeks.

Also dont forget $amzn pharmacy as a new business has started as has amazon luxury. Starting small but potential for huge growth and likely higher margins. Twitch and advertising on the amazon site/app itself should keep growing massively leading to much higher margins and eps.’

TD just released a NEW PT last week of $17.50. 

Alot of initial catalysts are now passed, but since the uplisting to TSX two weeks ago, there's alot more liquidity.

Ya in the future, like in say 2 years, but not right now. PSR should be compared to Best Buy because GME hasn’t transitioned yet. You’re talking about it as if they already have. They are still largely a B&M company. Also we haven’t received guidance from Cohen & co so everything is speculation at this point. I’m very bullish but your PT in the near term is absurd imo. Good write up tho. Important to rally the troops. I’m selling around $60. and will jump back in on the dip. MOASS is nearly impossible unlike everyone thinks.

Not disagreeing with your comment but if you look at the March 2020 crash or the September/October correction, ARK funds crashed as much as SPY. Even though some of their top holdings went down more than 50% (in March). I suppose this is the magic of diversification AND active management??

One would think a growth fund for this would crash more than SPY but that wasn’t the case.

His 13% stake is restricted stock that cannot be traded for 6 months since purchasing. This happened once he surpassed 10% (making him an insider). He can buy more but he can't sell (until June). This is why people were so excited when the 13D was announced.

Good luck! I'm genuinely confused how anyone could have lost money on GME. It's good that you realized you're not cut out for this and should quit.  You should find a new hobby/passion/distraction or you'll be back here on Tues. Anyways, best of luck! Don't check GME in a month or you'll have an incurable case of FOMO

If you want an alternative semiconductor play maybe consider $AMKR, it's a chip packing and testing company which is an essential step of the entire supply chain . It currently traded at $18 (gone up from $6) with only 14 P/E, better ROE(14.1%) and low market cap of $4.4B. The downside is that the volume is relatively low and only monthly options. I loaded up some shares at $15 and doing good so far.

I’ve been in on GME since Nov. With an initial avg cost of ~16/share. Been slowly averaging up to ‘help’ the cause, and now I’m sitting on 221 shares with an avg cost of $27 something. I’m about 4k deep in margin (yes I’m aware should not be buying GME shares on margin) but I’ve got plenty of other equities that I could liquidate to divest completely from it. What’s your confidence level that this could reach that estimated SP you stated?
I got my car from there and would never use something else (unless I’m brand new buying straight from the mfg dealer)

Fuck dealing with a smelly sleezy car salesmen though

That said, no idea if they’re over valued or not

The service is solid as fuck though
No. This is becoming a tech focused eccommerce company with RC. Compare price to sales to amazon, chewy, ebay etc.
Did you?
BB is a much better bet at this point. Nokia has a long way to go
I’m sorry this happened to you 🐻
Yeah I’ve learned calls 3+ months out ITM or at least close to it are generally the way to go. Might have to pay more upfront but much greater chance the shit doesn’t expire completely worthless at least
Big Mac Attack
same lol
Salmon?
well 1.9 million of us own shares
Tsla model s refresh imminent, not gonna affect stock price materially imo but still good news
Cramer gets it
Well bears had their once in a blue moon opportunity. Now back to the routine bull market tendies
PROBABLY SOME POLYGON ARTICLE.
I completely agree. Selling a Covered Call at $60 would mean I at betting the stock does not rise to $60 this week. 

I am holding my shares with Diamond Hands. Have been since August.
Foldable iPhone in the headlines. Maybe my fucking apple calls will finally print.

Thanks
Oh I see, you’re just fear-mongering, spamming fuckwad

Crawl back into your cave
Realtors do not generally flip houses they sell other people's houses for commission. There are a few who do and some that have people at arm's length doing the flipping. That shit is hella sketchy and requires 50 disclosure forms. Tldr: you don't
Then they lost it all expecting it to crash more
Thanks I couldn't be arsed
Send feet pics
I mean it could stay at .01 and you get out even (minus any brokerage fees). Or it could go up to any number (unlimited gain theoretically) like $1 and you make 100X
wow. just read. that was impressive dd
You sound rly insecure
Bb made me 6k in November when it was like 6.30 had like 125 10c so let’s see if 1-29 15c calls work
Melvin stop
Calls on pepper for the short sneeze 🤧
THANKS FOR THE ANALYSIS

I know I should have put rockets in my DD fuck

\s I know I am a retard and an autist
Damn these fund managers are trying everything they can to drive the price down, jokes on them we gonna 💎✋ real hard.
Hell yeah, I’m here for it too
Actually false. Because they kept buying puts right after march
You sound rly insecure
Define lottery ticket

I tend to define a lottery ticket as a low cost yet high risk option and I don't think that's what you're meaning
>block that shit. Do not recommend me content from this channel or "not interested in bisexuality"
True the issue is they then lost it all
good hedge to get puts for it
Cathie I love you please buy more salmon tendies
Not exactly sure what you’re confused about here lol

Lol holy fucking shit
I have one at 420.69, another at 694.20, and another at $999.
on monday ill prob drop that for you
Fuck that. GME🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Bro my retardation prevents me from understanding half of what you said but i read 🚀🚀🚀 so my confirmation bias says you're right
Lol I’m balls deep in GME for the long haul because I believe in Cohen. But how high do you think this has to squeeze to surpass Apple?
AOC feet pictures: ???
You sound rly insecure
Dude I got the bike and it's already broken. I want my money back
Nah, when I jump around too much I always end up losing. I’m confident in PLTR
I did. I just raised my price target to 420.69
All in on Monday!
Poots
He says with his 1 month old account. Terrible troll.
It blows my mind that WSB hasn't latched onto XBC yet. I've been considering writing a DD about them for this sub, but kind of appreciate the steady growth and don't necessarily want to catalyze volatility. I am up 158.37% on this stock and my first tiny purchase was Feb 18th, 2020. Been buying all along the way... 

No options, so i guess that's a partial explanation.
100
Huh
Lol!
Every week
Shes pregnant. Its not yours.
Fuck melvin, every cent of profit I made skimming GME calls after the past few Cohen Catalysts has been converted into GME shares. If GME goes to $0 I will have lost nothing that wasn't earned in the market, and almost entirely on GME alone.

GME is infinity or nothing. Melvin worked hard to fuck over my friends who were on the floors of our local stores for years. I can't stop holding and my position won't stop growing, GameStop's going to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
Ban this spamming fuck
You guys make fun of the bears but they made more money on puts during the March crash then you guys will ever make on calls this year or last year.
Take a break and eat healthy for like 3-4 days, helps build that shit back up
Calls could get IV crushed though if bears and bulls fight sideways, however they could print hard if this goes up. Doesnt even need to moon.

They all voted for three house owning, so lazy he got kicked off a commune Sanders.
What's the price to book
Invest it all in BB and then wait a couple weeks
Honestly not sure but that sucks if they do

So I just checked and price movement alerts stay active until they're activated by price moving above or below whatever target is set
Fuck. Pi apologize.
I meant 1+ day of holding
Just 10x the last of it
Interesting so it’s either an all or nothing call. If it hits .02 you make 100% or you lose everything.
I think I’ll be doing put 8$
Sheeeeesh, I got 130 shares but holding strong!
I thought we were doing 694.20
Gotcha. I just kinda feel like I am not actually in the green if the loans are still there. Thanks for your reply!
Using margin would be disastrous if it were to dip after Tuesday

Great fucking DD. I’m buying a shit ton more after reading this.
My gameplan basically. It staying above $200 is highly unrealistic. If it does break $200 I sell and buy back in at $100 or $50 or whatever the hell it'll drop back to then ride it back to $200 under Daddy Cohen's guidance
still cheap

It’s gonna go tits up. I just feel bad for young autists who listened to the constant GME pump from bag holders and bought at top. Oh well, they deserved it I guess.
Mother of all short squeezes
It actually went down and recovered the next day when things calmed down
What if u just wanna sell when the stock is at 420.69 is that ok?
My LEAPS expire November, if we hit $35 I’m probably going to close them and buy a Jan 2023 with a .7 delta

To quote u/plinky4

“GME looking good.

The dip today triggered sec rule 201, which means on tuesday the price can't get drilled by shorting like it has been for the last 3 days. They can still fight upward movement by shorting, but they can't short and short and short to create artificial dips. Even if you're not confident in the squeeze, I'd say you can be safely confident in tuesday.

"The squeeze has not yet squoze" is not a meme. What we're waiting for is brokers to start issuing margin calls, forcing shorts to buy shares and back out of their positions. With rumors that margin requirements for GME specifically across brokerages are increasing, we are moving closer and closer to them saying "enough bullshit" and pulling the trigger.

I want to make this clear that GME is not a typical play based on fundamentals and investor confidence in the company's prospects. This is a purely market meta bullshit battle, which imo is a much surer thing. Even if you think Cohen is a hack and LMFAO OMNICHANNEL, you should take a hard look at this play.”
I am still curious about trillions being printed out of thin air going into pockets of already rich people and it having no negative impact whatsoever. If i learned something from full metal alchemist is that somethings gotta give.
This ain’t no short squeeze WERE GOIN FOR MAXIUM SQUIRT.
40 shares in and going $11k more shares on Tuesday
!RemindMe in 10 months
Hold. Dont fucking sell man regardless of what happens. only sell at 150+ we going real high. If squeeze doesnt happen cohen still takes us to the moon

Yea. At least the average leftists do (the useful idiots).

Y’all ever got a BJ after she drank ice cold water or piping hot coffee? Shits fucking amazing bros
Been holding gold and silver stocks for ~9 months now and I think I’m selling these fuckers on Tuesday. Being done with this bullshit will be worth taking the L.
PSA: If you’re planning on buying GME shares and holding for more than a couple days (which you absolutely should be doing), buy those shares in an IRA and avoid taxes.
This is the way
If that happens the stock will be healthier and easier for cohen to take us to the primised land. Slower than a squeeze. Inevitable though.
[removed]
Are there people still in GME?

Is it mostly the same people still in PLTR?

Basically train missers rendered bag holders?
I’ll pm. I don’t want to post this level of detail
Dude why would you compare psr to the SP500?? You should compare it to other brick & mortar like Best Buy which is 0.7. With that said, $60 is the appropriate PT as of now and if they double their sales $120 in late 2021. Good write up but you’re definitely off on a few things

Haha what an autistic sheep herd. This is the beginning of an end of WSB. I specifically like the assumptions of this GME trade mania. Good luck idiots.

Disclosure: bought puts in Thursday, already in the green.
I suppose, but that’s a pretty drastic drop. Can’t remember the last time we had a -3% day
Am I the only one who doesn’t give a fuck about “build a pc kiosk.”? Who the hell wants to build their pc inside a fucking GameStop? Their employees wouldn’t know shit to help you, and I wouldn’t want to be bothered or judged while tinkering. 

I’m bullish on Cohen as well but the gaming market is a completely different beast. He can’t treat gamers like pet owners, we genuinely always search for the best deal, not for whoever thinks we love our games more lmao.
How do you put in a request for GME FDs loss porn on here?

So why are we predicting a short squeeze? Lol sorry I'm a true autist
[deleted]
Who dat
Will my fellow WSB autists think less of me if I dump my TSLA for GME?
Well I hope there won’t be a better price.
The bigger issue is you’re a cuck
Im almost 100% convinced some of the Mods here are jacked to the tits with GME, so they turn a blind eye to the spectacularly retarded posts coming in every minute.
When you see a number that makes you physically ill because you don’t understand how you made that much money you sell, if that number never comes you hold because GME has a bright future with Cohen
I read this as “wife shits the bed” at first
Right hadn't thought about the holiday. I'm thinking I could take more outta this with a call, then use that to then put in more shares. So basically it's either I put in 10 shares now or a $37/38 call for 100. Either way profit taken out of it is gonna go right back into stock, but I'm thinking that call would just give me more to work with later
Bro this is the best thing I’ve read all year. Lmao they’re not even sugar coating it. “You might want to take your money elsewhere. We’re retarded and are losing a shit ton of money”

Had a neighbor who would practice his stand up routine drunk as shit on a karaoke mic at full volume at 4am. 

One time he had a friend over and they took turns arguing into the mic about how one of them didn’t sleep with a girl because he was too busy eating a plate of eggs and sausage. And then the other guy would be like “You don’t know, you were playing PlayStation, I did too sleep with her.” I had a final at 8 am.
Do you think I should buy on Tuesday or wait for a better price? I’m just afraid of missing a squeeze

67 shares on Stash and 35 on RH checking in. Buying more on Tue for the cause.

55-60
The only bear thesis is if we don’t get a catalyst and the shorts slowly wiggle their way out of their shorts and we only end up at like $60 but if that happens then I’m just going to keep holding because I have so much faith in Cohen long-term
What do you guys think about ICLN and TAN short term? Could it be beaten down further, or will it start to recover next week?

Hi fellow britbong here, is the stock expected to drop at all next week or is it buy time Tuesday and strap in? I'm a newborn when it comes to stonks but I'm starting to get FOMO on GME.
Read this again. If a squeeze doesnt happen, long term this is 5 bagger anyway. Hold like tesla. HOLLLDDDDDD
1 share and more options 🚀🤡
2-3%? Are you out of your mind?
$90
Is it me, or the longer we have to wait, the bigger the squozening?

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
So....bears r fuk?
I feel like it's safe at this price even if it stalls
[deleted]
Good point, I never considered that there was any evidence for that. However, the owed shared still exist SOMEWHERE. Does it even matter if it's owned by Melvin? It seems that the squeeze would come easier if it the shorts were split up unless they are held by someone with even more resources

I have been trading stocks for 20 years and options for about 15. I have spent thousands on options courses and trading seminars. I have made some money here and there, but I’m definitely mostly negative over my full trading history when it comes to my options/risky portfolio (I have my 401k and Roth separate). I discovered WSB back in August and am fully bought into the GME story. Over the last 4 months I’ve made enough to offset pretty much ALL of the losses I’ve ever suffered, and I’m still way long in GME stock and long-dated calls. I’m also long PLTR calls and stock. I fully expect this to change my investing life over the next 12-24 months. My plan is to pay off my mortgage with the profits. I’ll let you know how that goes...

Ive been waiting on RH to link yo my bank but I think cuz I use a credit unnion its difficult. I have to wait and have been waiting to hear back from their customer service about my issue. I think because things are time sensitive Im going to have to stay with Stash and just watch the ticker instead of being able to set that option for me

Literally just don’t use margin and buy as much as you can possibly afford. A lot of people, myself included dumped other share listings to get as much equity into GME before it peaks. Do you’re DD but from what I hear GME can possibly go e-commerce along with some other corporate level moves. Short squeeze should last all day or into Wednesday so hold your shares with the strongest fist you can. Autists, together - strong.
She used to look so cute but over the years, she got the same actress cosmetic surgeries every else does. Now she looks like everyone else
I’m gonna wait till Tuesday and hopefully I profit. Then I’ll sell immediately and buy shares. I’m an autist, I apologize
What if GME doesn't hold above $30?

In my humble opinion... Gamestop will become an app with either exclusivity to Microsoft consoles or a universal ability to use. 

"Oh yeah.. so what will this app be you retard?" - 🌈🐻🤡

It will be an app that will rival Twitch and Stadia. It will literally cause retailers to lose the ability to profit off of the vg market. Walmart, Bestbuy, Target, even motherfucking Amazon will have a hard time justifying keeping shelf space. HEAR ME OUT RETARDS! Gamestop is going to become an app that you pay a membership for(BIG FUCKING DICK MONEY RETARDS) and through this membership they will be able to allow downloads, trailers, fucking ADVERTISEMENTS, etc. This bitch is going with Dr. Niel DeGrass Tyson on a tour of the fucking COSMOS baby!! 💎👐 you fucking idiots who are doubting!!

Good point, but I was thinking that might be weighted more heavily into ARKX when it begins trading. I have 50k set aside to get in on the ground floor of that fund.

why have you gone and said something like this?
RH gives you up to 1k of your initial deposit. The rest takes \~4 days to clear. My day 4 is either Mon or Tue and then I'll have 5k coming through for GME moon missions.

Also use Stash because it links directly to my bank without the clear time on deposits. Downside is the 4 trade windows per day. Those REALLY fucking suck.

RE:7 - I don't think I would consider that chart to be showing true growth- just a return to the trend pre-pandemic, which is a decrease in growth as Obama-era programs trickled off and the effects of Trump tariffs increased production costs for most industry.

Also in 2, which unemployment rate is that? I would be less concerned with the U3 rate than the workforce participation rate.

Overall I agree that it's not an imminent burst. Good writeup.

Guys I know how to beat the S&P 500 index. Just buy SPY + 1 share of GME.
Can't help you there. You either believe in what they are doing and jump on the bandwagon or enjoy the memes.
At least they are not paperhanded bitches like Cramer wanted them to be and dilute at the first 50% jump.

ON is an acquisition target as well. My guess is they'll be acquired by the end of 2022 by another semiconductor company. The space is consolidating and with Intel-Altera and AMD-Xilinx, ON its the next logical choice.
What do you mean do your part? An administration that's actively for l measures to combat climate change and introduce "greener legislation" is now in place. Not only that, we've been actively moving towards the goal of neutral carbon emissions with or without the Paris Accord. 

You hold this country to the highest standard yet you're stating that we're not special? Then why the higher standard, do you not see the frustration there or are you dismissing it entirely because of bias? 

We want the same treatment as other countries in the Paris Climate Agreement, however if you're not willing or are afraid of imposing the same penalties on countries like China and India for breaking the rules set in place, why are we in the Agreement in the first place?

If you don't know what you are doing buy one share of GME and one share of QQQ or SPY and learn. You don't need to blow your entire 65.47 on GME and get sad.

Hey op, how did you learn options so well? Got any resources for those starting out?
I hope someone shares this video with him on Monday so he can either laugh, cry, or cry from laughing at the collective crazy that this sub has produced. Thanks for the laughs.
Yes but my other roommate just left for a sunday morning walk with his girlfriend, this happened 11 AM,  so I don't blame him for thinking it would be okay to not lock the door again while we were home. My other roommate was already awake too but he hasn't heard anything. We live in the city centre yeah but this is really bold
If GME stop opens at $35 or lower tomorrow I'm buying more. 200 shares is not enough I feel like
Mods, I think you should start making the sub private.This sub is getting way overexposed to the public...I think
TBF if he bought leaps or shares, he will come out as winner in the long run. Chances of you failing in the long run is much higher than him becasue he is inherently taking less risk. I don't blame him especially if its his retirement money.

But, it isn’t sustainable. We are discussing two different strategies here. You’re not wrong, but it has way more risk and isn’t preferable. The argument is if options affect the SP, they don’t.

Please refer to my OG comment and GLTUA
Wait really?
The loss won’t hurt, but if we r pretty sure it’s not going to increase by 5 then it’s a no brainer to sell. I’ll wait to see how the day starts before doing anything.

Exactly. He does.
Looks like you invested in POO eh?
Greed, the answer is greed and confidence that any rise in price is temporary, GameStop would go bankrupt and the share price on it's way to zero. That's why they didn't close and arrived at this point.

You mean with his "real" callers with "real" questions?
Doubt. I have multiple colleagues who immigrated over from China and the main reasons being the workplace culture is extremely toxic, desire to raise a family, and more prospects from a professional aspect. The US definitely lacks in skilled labor (engineers, scientists, etc.) but as long as we keep open and friendly relationships with other countries I doubt we will fall behind more than we currently are.

Right, that’s what I think. That’s 10x or more from where we’re now. 💰
It’s so easy to get caught into the excitement over all this. Dreaming of that pie in the sky on what potential money can be made. However I never hear what *could* happen that could be disastrous for some. Yes this could lead to some substantial gains but couldn’t it also lead to losing big? I think it’s important to help people realize that too is that is *is* still a gamble right?

How easy is it to become a realator and start flipping houses
Since making my RH account I have saved up from full time work $1k in various listings with close to no gains or losses (not including gains from some lucky Sony/PFE calls). I’m going ALL IN on Tuesday
Company values aren’t static. They make more money, valuation increases, stock goes up. If they lose money, reverse. Not a zero sum.
I was reading that too but I mean if it fell below whatever it would automatically sell so I don't know if I really want to use that option. Like if I set it for $100 and it went to $80 that option would kick on and still sell at $80 at close. IDK if I trust that ??  Wouldnt it be more wise to just watch the ticker and use that only ? (below on ETrade) 

Risks of a Stop Order

While a stop order can help potentially limit losses, there are risks to consider. Let’s continue with our $95 stop order example. In calm markets, if XYZ stock trades through $95, you most likely will get the trade executed near that stop price. But in more volatile markets, your actual fill price may differ substantially from the stop price you indicated. For example, suppose XYZ reports earnings after the close and the next day, the stock opens at $80. Since the stock price went below $95, your stop order would trigger and execute at $80, which is a much bigger loss than you had planned on when setting the stop price.
I dont even understand the word understand

People talk about "runup to earnings" as if it is a given. But a few of my stocks have not had a significant runup. TSM popped for about 3 or 4 hours after beating earnings. No runup. WFC had a decent runup of maybe 5-7%, and then dropped 7% day of earnings after basically meeting expectations. 

Why is there this thought that there will always be a runup? Is it usually true? TSLA has earnings soon, for example. But I don't know if it's a "given" that there will be a runup. Same for AMZN. 

What do you guys think? Is it a no-brainer to buy calls for companies with upcoming earnings, or no?
Cos  gay bears are either so fuk  they cant go long or they are empty head
and I’ll shit in your hair. Positions?
Get the dog. 2200 shares for 20 bucks
Yeah man, makes me feel better knowing others experience this, as we speak all I hear is THUD THUD THUD BOOM
I’m 90% in GME but have lost it all going 100% before so not trying to be too retarded
Wtf
With your fine autistic artistry please do Theodens rallying speech next plz 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
good for them. Now why not go buy some amd and tsla dips so we can make some money?
wsbetters spread BB propaganda which means it gonna pump and boomers algos gonna get squeezed. Not joking here just stating the obvious
Bottom to top that's a \~400% jump, Gamestop has already moved +1000%.  Gamestop is also a much worse company than Volkswagon.
I am not disputing that share price should go down immediately after share offering. It's very logical that even smooth brain like I can understand it.
But if you zoom out and take larger context into account I'd say share offering is no brainer.
Sentiment after ER, where they introduced 100MM shelf offering (note it's in absolute dollars not shares) was that they are diluting without any clear idea what to do with that money, since they didn't say anything about it. 
A lot has happened since. First Ryan Cohen upped his stake in the company, then he made it to Board of Directors with his Chewy crew.
If they have a plan I have no objection to them raising money and turning the company around. Since markets are forward looking if whatever they present is semi-realistic I see that as very positive, because now they have plan and money to execute it.
And 100MM will now get you 2x less shares than two months ago so dilution argument is even less convincing. Although when they do offering I think 100MM is out of the window.

Sir, this is a GME slot machine
That is not how a casino works

I am not a licensed financial advisor but I am a high functioning retarded man child. This is not financial advice. You should buy 10 shares of GME and set your limit sell to $69.

Just remember guys there’s a reason Cramer is on CNBC and not a fund manager anymore. Now that he can’t lose anymore of other people’s money, he wants to take away our tendies by bringing attention to wsb. If you’re reading this Jim, and you probably are, back your boomer ass up before all of wsb collectively forms a big green dildo and rams it up your old ass.
The squeeze is not happening this week. Just hold
This one u need to read. There are going to plenty of bear shit dds in here in the coming week. Conservatively short squeeze or no this shit is going to 80$ a share. But bears a fukt and are scared. Read the post. He said I would go from a 8 iq to 9. But I think it's more at a 7. But it's worth the read

Edit: and buy shares with ur actual cash.
Show positions or I’ll cum in your hair
Yep.  So one of every ARK ETF.
I bought them at 10:37am on Friday, not my best work. Cost average was .88, so $2,200 bet that closed Friday at $825 market value. I'm not sure it will hit 28, but if there's a good Spike Tuesday it might get the contract price bumped from the .33 it closed at to something I'm ok with exiting at. Tuesday is a wild card, I'm actually a little more confident in it running up on Wednesday because of the inauguration.
Maybe not. Could very well print. buy shares though. Basically everyone says shares are the way.
Pause
Solid content, you do us all proud OP. I'm 500 shares deep and buying more every time I get paid, let's fucking do this. Hoping I can get over 700 shares before the squeeze really hits. We'll see!
Love you Titus 😢 good shit

House car expenses paid in china, making 125k no taxes taken out. Should i put 5k a month into meme stocks and some leaps and hope for the best? I win and retire early, i lose and never return to the US. 
Trying to retire by 50!! I lost my house, ira and 401k in '09. This is my only hope, unless i hear a better idea.

shouldve bought more but I went with $SQ 2023 leaps
this dude said $299? don’t talk to me or my 4 shares ever again
Lol that's not what I wrote but classic scarecrow argument. Believe it or not the world still exists as we know it BECAUSE we took steps in the past 20 years and we didn't sit on our hands doing nothing. There's a reason why almost every scientist in the entire world agreed the steps we were taking were necessary... it's not even an argument the evidence is all there. I don't have time to argue well proven facts with anti climate change conspiracists so believe, don't believe it, shove it up your ass, idc.
So I’m new to trading and I didn’t think about buying shares but I made a call for 1/22 $39, am I fucked? I yolod all my money
2/19 after demo day after earning after lockup ends

Good, look up dollar cost averaging if you want to read further.
Thats what i was implying anyway brother!
Ok, I see. So basically the real question is do you think the squeeze will continue? And are wsb tardos really that powerful that it will increase another $5+ dollars by Friday? Are you prepared for it to expire worthless? Haha good luck mate. I’m probably going to be watching how premarket and the open goes and then maybe scaling into some far out mid 2021 calls for 35-45 strike prices. MAYBE we’ll see lol

As someone who’s had gme since it was worth like 7$, it was a little bit of a trip to realize that 3.12 shares are worth 120$
Bro, you know what i mean, no bank is buying this, only people who were shorting and had to cover for the short term because they know its going back down in the short term. Bro consoles hype will die out when more are available and Walmart gets most of the consoles anyways. And realize you say soon and yet to be announced, so as of now its a dud after this short squeeze, its at the peak. Only thing can save GME rn is to do a offering at there current price and announce a business model like Bestbuy more skewed to games, or even buying steam and renaming game stop. Anything else is a dud.
True

Yes. Diamond hands the volatility. Also if this drops, (highly unlikley) Sub 30, its a lottery ticket.
I looked into it for you and you can't on stash. I recommend a better broker. Personally i use etrade, but a lot of people here use robinhood.
Shoosh SEC
Quack
So buy 2/19 20c got it
I’m not reading all of that. But I know I need a Switch controller and I’m ensuring that I buy it from GameStop instead of Best Buy or Target to pump up that revenue.

Bitch, you can fucking say *shit* on this sub
Has anyone done DD on BB? I value the company a little bit more than it is right now (market cap) however there are so many shares outstanding that this will neither be a short squeeze nor a 10 bagger. I'm expecting a 2-3 bagger at most. Thoughts?

That won't be relevant when spy opens -4% on Tuesday
Wtf 😭
~55 shares @ ~$36/ea is $2k.....If GME hit $400/share - thats ~$22k. Even then, At least doubling your money would help. And yes, HOLD.

*sigh* Yeah, we all know it's illegal, but there's rarely any **real** consequences to those that take part in it.

Look at my Congressman, Richard Burr. He was briefed on the incoming fallout of the covid19 pandemic, and subsequently dumped $1.7 million dollars worth of stocks in Feb.; days after the Senate Intelligence Committee briefing, and days before the huge downturn on Wall St., and the months long fall of the economy. 

This happened almost a year ago, and although he's under investigation, not a single charge has been filed. 

It's bullshit. He won't have charged brought against him, and he will get off scot free. Now, I'm not advocating that OP's synopsis is true on account of all this; I'm merely showing that it's not as much of a fantasy as you would believe.

Haha, it’s the weekend so market is closed, and it’s MLK day on Monday so market is closed also.
It surprised me  too seeing insane card prices and packs reselling and stuff but youtubers and such made Pokémon way more hyped now than ever. It’s bigger now than when kids collected their base set charizards 10/15 years ago because now those kids grew up and got even more money to spend. Would be neat if they can come up with something to make better use of their position here
7% yearly returns killed me
Fucking kids too!! This baffled me cause they didn't have any kids, then all of a sudden they had 2 little assholes running around and shouting. Like did you just pop out 4 year old twins?! I think they were just watching family over the holidays or something cause it recently stopped.

I think 3 day weekend is bullish after a pretty boring week last week (other than GME). Also riots and shit are bad for the market but ultimately Biden just has to get inaugurated & we’re good.. dudes first 10 days are gunna be super ambitious, people will be getting stimulus and I think the market will be happy about that

I took a similar hit not too long ago, bought snow at its high with the intention to short but instead I changed my mind right before i submitted my trade and bought long. Took a couple weeks off from trading and now I’m slowly but surely recovering. Changed up my trade style to options rather than dumping 6 figures on shares. I was humbled and now I’m much more cautious with my “fuck it” moves
What positions do you hold? I may have missed that in the write up
Damn, I simply can’t see a scenario where it doesn’t go up long term
Last weekend I had a dream that NIO would open at $65 this past Monday which it did. Last night I had a dream that the Lucid deal went through. Let’s see if my dreams are right again.
Worst game I played in my life. Such a shity everything
Mmm mmm m B m
It helps, and i understand where you're coming from.

However, let's think for a minute. Typically the market maker selling you the option is not selling you a naked call, correct? That would be suicidal. This means that - when you buy a call, the market maker has to buy shares to hedge against your position.

They don't want to be bankrupted by your call.

So... Buying calls has an indirect (and arguably greater) effect on the share price. Am I still wrong?
My DKNG plays disapprove
How did you possibly lose money in this market? 

I am a complete novice outside of oversimplified rules I've learned from watching Youtube Buffet interviews, and even I am at 10% growth before my recent buying spree.

Why do you keep repeating “this quarter” as if console sales are going to drop.

It’s already on their website and there’s already DD about the PC building and prebuilts that’s yet to be announced that’s the thing.
Big money did buy in last week. Why you think it went up? 7m shorts went to cover after some whales did long buys.
How will the hype of a console cycle die out next quarter? These things give GME free money for two years. As well they have a partnership with Microsoft for digital revenue.
Credit upgrade could easily come too here soon.

Yes. Tuesday probably won't bring shit, and having expectations for an exact day is only setting yourself up for failure. Have patience, this WILL end well. Give it time.

I told everyone i was getting ready to short and i got down voted hard.  What's the point?  You're not dating gme, you don't have to defend it
Bro I fee you. Mine drive me crazy, give me all types of anxiety. All three of them are 300+ pounds and they have a 2 year old who runs and stomps all day, everytime they walk its like an earthquake. Just the absolute worst neighbors ever. Slam every cabinet, just for no reason, they are just very loud people. Idk where to move but i want out of this hell i pay lots of money for. Oh and not to mention I guess they are so fat now the floor squeaks and creaks everywhere they walk. I cant even concentrate when i work

Lol imagine a card where you had to have a certain amount in calls for more rewards. 

Market crash plus a trip to the bar to drown your sadness about said crash could put your rewards in doubt 😂

Who knows, tomorrow’s market on the Frankfurt exchange will give an insight as to what might happen. Personally I think it dips a bit and flatlines for a couple weeks after that. The shorts didn’t cover which means they are doubling down - and they have billions to throw at it.

No MOASS unless good news comes in the next 1-3 weeks. I’ve accepted this. A gradual rise could benefit us too. We can continue to build up our # of shares and price should rise with each good piece of news. Shorts will close their positions and this will also increase share price.
Do you know what real dementia looks like? It’s debilitating, it’s incredibly hard to watch. It means a severe disruption in a persons ability to get through daily life. I’ve personally cared for a family member who went through it in the later years of their life, and it’s heart-wrenching. 

For you to just say he has dementia because he stumbles over his words and makes dated references is ridiculous.

Even mild neurocognitive disorder requires strategies to help a person maintain independence, and Biden is very far from that.

Hahah thanks my man! Share this post to everyone under the sun!
I'm rolling my calls as long as it takes to get them out of the money.
Retarded question from a fellow retard. If a call option is worth 0.01 could it go lower? Say for example. You bought a call at 0.01 and the stock goes down.  I haven’t seen one drop below 0.01. Would the broker remove that call option or would they just hold it until expiration?
It does and thats why I love this sub
Now that’s what I like to hear 🐻🌈
That the market prices in risk? Yeah I believe that.

Do I believe that something awful is likely to happen inauguration day?  No.
Don't look at me like that, I'm retarded

Ok, thank you. I have a few shares I bought when it dropped a lot late Dec/early Jan just so it would be on my watch list. It was like upper 8s. Was surprised to see how much it rebounded. Wanted to add more but was very hesitant because it fluctuated a lot. I wanted to wait for it to go down again to the 8s, but it doesn't sound like it will happen. Just have to jump in 🚀🚀
This is what I think too. the number of small puts shows lots of retail shorts I think.
I’m aware. Either from people not knowing or speculation because they are very similar companies.

All you had to say is that you're bag holding like a chump.
Forgive me for the stupid questions since I'm trying to wrap my head around this, but why is that more beneficial than buying Tuesday morning?
We all thought the market was hitting critical mass then. Now we're not even questioning it as it blows by $2 trillion. Just ride the wave.
That's a whole $320 000.

Seattle so not as expensive... It's a nice apartment, in a nice neighborhood (well, besides the transients on the streets) and I expect my neighbors to all be Indian Amazon tech workers.

yeah just put it all in TSLA
It will fall to 90 after it hits 100, then it will go to 200.

Pure speculation but you get my point
Theta will bury those so fast.. is a four days trading week only.
Because margin calls are going out. Have collateral on the side to support your shit. If longs dont get margin called but shorts do we win big time
Yeah apparently he’s going right to work on Inauguration Day and with climate listed as one of the big 4 things I feel like ICLN has to get a boost. I can’t imagine the entirety of Biden + blue wave in congress is priced in. I’m the same though, I have calls for every expiration essentially for ICLN lol

But naw Biden isn’t super progressive but I honestly think he’s gunna be pushing some pretty progressive agendas especially post-covid while people are hurting. Granted it’s several years later so the goalposts have shifted but I imagine he’ll be more progressive than Obama was
GME = shares only.
Fantastic DD and had some information I hadn't seen before on the movements of shorts and their average pricing going back into December. The one big piece of the puzzle nobody has for the squeeze is how many shorts are retail versus institutional. But even that won't stop the squeeze just change how fast it blasts off and potentially how high it gets at the peak with institutions probably unwinding in a more controlled manner while retail just gets fed to the bulls.
That is right. GME is a shares play.

Welp, after a year of not taking it, I’m going back on Vyvanse.

Btw hit me up if you want to talk physics, might be able to give you some tips 😉.
How the fuck do you have 100k?
I have way more chromosomes than you will ever have
That's short's thesis and they have right to it.
I'm just pointing out that stock offering at high prices is not bearish at all. If anything it's bullish. Short's thesis is that company is running out of money and no one would lend them a lifeline. When (imo not if) they do it their bankruptcy aka short thesis would be even less convincing than it was in the past.

As I’ve said many times, i work in the natsec/ic space
None of the pc parts has been announced and 100mill isn’t enough for it to be sustainable, so what if all the shorts have to cover, sure they have to, but u need big money buying in, to expect a profit not a quick flip. They can’t sell out of consoles for ever, that hype will die by next quarter, so what’s the real catalyst, and what other fund is buying in, what upgrade did gme get? How will they make money after this quarter? How? Sales drives P/E ratio that makes the stock price.

I'm new to this game. My poor ass is getting the stimulus packages and I'm seriously tempted to put $2k down on GME ahead of time. I have 3 shares of GME now and want to maximize. Am I stupid?
For real why can’t I buy shares on margin?  I got stopped out at 35.50 on Friday which half of my shares were on margin.  Still made a good profit.  I want to buy back in if this bitch goes below what I was stopped out of.  Think the shorts can bring it down before noon mission or is this shirt already on the elevator?  Feel free to tell me to fuck off or answer what you think.  Thanks!
Cohen gonna ressurect them. He feels  cheated out of selling CHWY early and this is his ticket to the big table.
Knowing that profit takers will take, but that if you're numbers are even close to right, that it'll still find a floor and spring back up, are you not going to take some profits on the way?

No way dude, I didn’t go to college
I didn’t read all of that but enough to get the direction you were going.

This is also my theory:

GS has been closing down locations to consolidate for restructured stores. 
They’ve already been testing this with beta test locations that have been remodeled with some of the new features. (PC & Console dedicated stations, TCG & Board game stations, Lounge Areas) that’s just part of the new restructuring.
C19 pushed a lot of that back and obviously caused some issues for GS.

They’re going to moon eventually, weather they get bought out or Cohen resurrects their ass.
Potential for prices go up hundreds.

Making stonks sink is not within our core competencies. Youre better off proposing a hostile takeover, were not 🏳️‍🌈🐻 and wont short it, but you might convince people to buy it up to the point where we’d be able to restructure the company(unlikely its fuckin nestle). There are also no obvious fundamentals or technicals to support an efficient/ meaningful entry. It would have to tank first and people would have to be able to come in at pennies on the dollar. Not enough people would believe sanctions on a company this large and set in globally would have any significant effect on what essentially amounts to a monopoly. Theyll litigate it out, company wont go anywhere. Lots of moving parts it wont be feasible without.

I think GameStop will be around even after the squeeze.  Gaming consoles and even computers of the future will be run virtually like what Google is trying to do with Stadia.  When the internet speed is fast enough you’ll be able to play without having the actual console.  Just need internet and display.  By then it’ll probably be a VR headset connected to wifi.  GameStop can leverage this to the tits by becoming a digitized powerhouse that bridges retards to the gaming companies because their websites are boomer as fuck since they are conscious of their branding which is B2B whereas GameStop is B2C and B2B

Since no serious answers, you probably just dehydrated yourself. Need water and vitamins.
Long term successful trading is about making a plan & sticking to it.

You made a long term investment, but got the chance to take a smaller profit much sooner than anticipated.

How do you want to handle that question as a trader? Will happen a lot and you should have mechanical approach to it.
This ones getting saved.
If you can imagine it, it can happen
Man this shit really is turning into *The Division*

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
This is biased. I don't see any "bear case" counterarguments.

Okay, I'll be the bear and shit all over this because it's flat out wrong.

>Nintendo next game console in 2022

Priced in. Doesn't matter. Same with the other revenue bump. I mean if quarterly revenue reports did not exist the actual boost in revenues just wouldn't hold water; it's a known thing so it's not really even in the thesis. That's like saying, "Winter is the busy time for snow plowing". It's just not smart.

>Data can be monetized by selling it to gaming manufacturers or developers

This aftermarket data is useless. No one cares if you traded in Dark Souls for Nioh. "New Trends" my ass. That is something someone jsut flat out made up without thinking about it for twenty seconds. That's again like saying, "People tend to buy snowblowers and shovels near the winter and summer". Yeah? And when did you learn that, when they were being sold, not a year later at a swapshop.

>Turning physical stores into a showcase vendor’s games or new concepts

They already do this. It's not a bullet point if it's already done. Have you not seen the little TVs in the corners of every store advertising shit? Are you blind? Have you never gone into one of these? And yeah, this is ten years old. It's not a new point. Let's use this as one word: "Advertising". Yeah, they've done that.

>Possibility to create a neutral platform for trading digital goods and charge a small fee for facilitating transactions

I swear there was something (**STEAM COUGH HUMBLEBUNDLE COUGH GOG COUGH IN-GAME PURCHASES LIKE IN MINECRAFT**) that already did this. And has been for a while. Huh. I must not be up on the trends. Sounds groundbreaking if they pull it off!

>E-sports tournaments/leagues to be held at physical stores

Jesus if this is on there you live under a fucking rock. For one most of the stores don't have the space, two they already got into the e-sports thing years ago (and it flopped, twice, read the investor letters) and three again, there *might* be competition that **already does this and has for ten years** so... I don't know. Again, "revolutionary thinking".

>Opportunity for GameStop to be a centralized e-commerce platform for gaming consoles, digital games, merchandise, customization of computers, laptops, gaming chairs, etc.

Now this is stupid. "Opportunity for Gamestop to be a centralized ..." makes no fucking sense. Let's spill this in plain English: GAMESTOP MISSED THE BOAT AND STEAM IS THE CENTRALIZED ECOMMERCE PLATFORM. We good? Good. There is no "opportunity" for this to occur as if there were a vacuum. This would have to be a hostile takeover of ridiculous proportions. Why people type so many words to say, "GAMESTOP FIGHT STEAM" I don't know.

>\[Cohen etc\]  Proven successful e-commerce track record

Cohen has had one company. One. That's it. It's not a "track record". It's a fucking singular company. Quit doing this. They ran a company that was in Cohen's control (so no, not even all together from the beginning) for 5 years. 5. STOP WITH THE LEGENDS. I mean this is not a Venture Capitalist investor who has made 30 bets on companies and brought back 10 from the brink. He made 1. It went well. That's it.

>Estimated short interest of 138% not covered

How the fuck does the shortsqueeze even matter? Get the fuck out of here with your "analyses".

Look, no more, stop guys. Stop. For one the "bear case" is just wrong and be TL;DR'd as such:

# GAMESTOP IS SO LATE TO THE GAME THAT IT PROBABLY WON'T BE ABLE TO PENETRATE THE MARKET SHARE OF THE FUTURE MARKETPLACE FOR GAMES IN ANY MEANINGFUL WAY WITHOUT NEW TECHNOLOGY AND INNOVATION.

That's the bear case. Gamestop is up against Steam, it is up against Microsoft (yeah, their partner), and Sony for the same thing in owning the digital marketplace. Fuck Amazon, you have to contend with literally the giants of tech *that produce the games they trade*.
And no way is it more risk. Land rarely if ever goes down in value. Buy in the right place and you can repurpose later on or sell it to someone that will. I’d rather have physical assets than an ETF. They’re going to be more and more in demand going forward.

Playing IV is way more profitable on weeklies. The initial upward trend will be the highest prices movement in terms of IV, and if it reverses you probably won't see that value again intraday without a much larger movement upward. LEAPS are cool but the real point of them(at least for me) is guard yourself from criminal amounts of theta burn. If your leap market isn't liquid the spread won't be tight either and you'll just be banking on IV to tighten it versus move upwards in premium.

I have 1 GME call for this coming Friday but based on reading it doesn’t seeem like the squeeze will happen this week. Should I sell the 41 call at open and just eat the loss or let it expire worthless? 

I have $5k in shares.
Positions?
Why not buy call options? Something with a feb 50 strike?
Maybe you should go with shares, not options. Have you ever heard of €GME?

Agreed. I've been selling monthly  cc's at the next closest strike because that's a point I find comfortable if I were to lose them and so far, I still have all my shares
So the question is this: when is the next time tesla will be at these levels after it goes down?

The only reasons not to sell are the following:
- you think tesla will continue to rise
- you think tesla will crash but recover quickly to higher levels than now
- you bought it at an insanely low price and think the money here can't be more profitable elsewhere EVEN IF you have to wait 20 years for Tesla.

Personally I believe that tesla will crash, but it will take a long time to come back to current or higher levels. During this time you may be able to find better investment opportunities. BUT, if you bought at like 1$, it's a personal decision. Who knows what things will be like long term? Tesla could straight up disappear in 15 years and never reach it's current price or never beat it by amt that would be worth waiting for.

I hope that made sense.
It's what you implied by saying "but actual racists use it now".

Printing money is a problem too but this won’t matter cause China couldn’t care less about climate and 3rd world countries don’t have the resources to combat climate change even though they are the top polluters.
No problem homie
Did everyone get fucked yet? lol or should I buy
You gotta ask yourself “If I’m an MM, should I hold these shares I was holding as a hedge against expired options and if I do hold what is the likelihood that we will see continued volumes on bullish positions going into 2021 with the worry of higher taxation?” IMO I’d say there’s a good chance they are done especially since yields are starting to rise, market will likely become less crowded so we won’t see the same conditions that drove us to ATH’s.
Fuck weekends. My homies (You autists) literal hate weekends. 🤬
Same bro
Aggressive measures are fine as long as they don’t infringe upon people’s rights. That’s where the argument disconnect was IMO. You can’t have a mandatory lockdown of a people when said lockdowns are illegal to enforce.
Tesla is special and did it as it was entering sp500 if I remember correctly. A second share offering would dilute the price of the shares. It's the reason why the price went so low after earnings report conference, dipping to $13. They already announced that they have intentions to do it, but they have a year to announce it.
Oh yes they will
Tit fucker

Is that up to date though? I thought those records only got updated at the end of the month once a month. Yahoo finance statistics shows the same number and “(as of dec 31st)” at the end. I didn’t think it was possible to see how many short positions there are until this end of month report.

That’s wrong. There’s no 2nd law of thermodynamics for money in the market. Money can be created and destroyed out thin air. Shorts made money on the way down in March, but not 100% of the value lost. It’s all fugazi fairy dust
https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/ go here and put in the option you're thinking and see . With decay on the value it will literally be worth like a dollar even a few percentages above the strike if it had a bad run that ate away at it.

Let me break down how this is going to play out for all you morons.  Cohen is going to dump most of his shares on GME before you even realize you're gf got gang banged by the high school golf team.

GME won't be Tesla. It's a game of chicken vs. wolves, squeeze vs sqoze. If a VW style short squeeze materializes, don't be greedy and lock these gains in even if that means missing out on another tippy top on top of the tippy top you sold into.

No one has provided evidence they have a direct short anywhere I can find and a lot of people say they do. The only thing I could find was their form 13 showing put. They don’t have to report short there but I don’t think there’s any evidence they have it. They May. But there’s no evidence. An in the money put on 5.4m shares of a 70m outstanding shares company is rather large as a position though.

Why is the burden of proof on me to disprove a rumor that lacks any direct evidence and also sounds like it’s outside good risk management?

NOK is my safety stock. Every time it dips I buy a couple thousand shares. Let it go up a dime and then sell to make a $100-$300 depending. I made 3k doing this last year. Not sexy but slow and steady. In order for this to really jump they need a stock buy back announcement and then a mid-sized reverse split.

Why would there be a run up? Makes no sense. Every single company that has locks drops like a stone on that day as employees take profit. I'm sure they are happy with the run up. Employees who are cash strapped or want to buy themselves a gift will bail. Only those with lots of cash won't sell.
Interesting and thanks.  I wonder how long they can keep it up with GME before they have to let go and allow the squozening to commence?

So now that we're here before revenue and profits have caught up, what will propel it further?
Your insecurity is showing.
We already knew that tho
Short it then, coward
Spread it out if you have the ability to. Figure out how many shares you plan to purchase and then spread the order out throughout the day. I.e. buy 20% at open, another 40% throughout the day buying dips and then the final 40% near close.
That was fucking epic dude. Well done.

Your rockets appear above reply form, but not on thread.
Read the whole thing. Extremely impressed, I've been in on GME before everyone went crazy on it this year. (Maybe October of 2020) but this is seriously the best DD I've read on it. I only wish it was longer.

The fact that institutions are saying the squeeze has happened shows how scared they really are of what's about to happen. The fact that the price ran up a few % friday, and did not finish on below 10% because of rule 201. Shows the only one selling are the shorts. The massive volume on the green day shows Big fish are moving in all of the sudden. And they didn't get shaken out.

Things are about to get wild. Its just a matter of when. Probably will use some of the squeeze funds to reinvest long in GME. I think Cohen will have them on lockdown.
Don't feel too bad, I have 3500
It only expires worthless if you don't meet the break-even price, correct?
So you’re saying that multi-year grinding bear markets can’t happen into economic growth? 

Are you sure about that?
That shoutout at the end, as he held back his tears... Had me roaring..

No, it's about the fact that no other country will be held to the same standard and suffer the same consequences our country will face if we fail to comply.

Im balls deep GME. Im poor so 125@13.4 is all I could afford. I havent bought new clothes in months and just drink water hahaha
You have autism bro
Next year is going to be worse since 25% of people who purchased a ps5 are locked into digital only sales. GME has to pivot and as fast as possible, the physical market is collapsing fast. Many of those people who covid pushed to digital are going to turn into converts. If anyone can do it, it's Cohen, fingers crossed.
Like a modernised arcade for streaming and tournaments... woah
I mean, I have 80 of those contracts with a cost average of 0.989 so ~$7,920 iirc. Lost $4,392 on those calls by close Friday as PLTR slipped from opening bell high. If they do rebound it should be a nice payday.
Your insecurity is showing.

Dubious ways:

gogoanime.io with an adblocker on my browser  (ublock origin)

OR even better I watch it on my amazon firestick connected into my 4k TV by downloading the fireanime app -- best method because who wants to watch tv on their laptop? (go to troypoint.com for the guide, if you're a noob who doesn't know how to install unofficial apps on a firestick)


Regardless of either option download ublock origin because the internet without ads or youtube ads is an amazing thing you need in your life.

Fuck knows. In a squeeze this could moon so hard. If it squeezes above 300 i dump everything to buy back in when it comes down. Depending on how many bears think they can get free money on the way up and short and the get margin called the squeeze could be exaggerated. Profit taking could dampen it. I have initial sell orders at 185 climbing to 300 but im gonna cancel them cos while writing this i realized how bonkers it could be

But these aren't real numbers. Take your low speed internet user and make the day one patch at 28gb and you are not playing that day, it then doesn't matter how big the game is either way its downloading overnight.

Now take the digital download and realize that your copy gets preloaded most of the time these days. Your now downloading the game in the background days before so instead of having to install, your only doing the day one patch. Digital has come a long way since you might be referencing, Cyberpunk preloaded 7 days before release on consoles.

Subreddit’s def gonna get shut down. “Roblox is a bunch of pedophiles don’t invest” can’t be a legal strategy lmao
Fair, that’s the only reason I haven’t bought more shares recently
Yes it is.  Because not all people in an age defined group (a generation) all have the same views or power in society (to affect it).  

Wealth isn't a commodity that is or should be equally shared.  Not everyone gets a trophy.  Certain people have more than others and there is nothing wrong with that.  Just like if you make winning stonk picks, you shouldn't have to share it with dingdong who shoved his money into losing 0dtes.

The economy was young when boomers entered the job market and those that invested rode the wave of growth in this country.  They did have a better opportunity over all.  But they weren't in control for much of that time (the previous generation was) and only slowly transitioned into positions of 'power' over time.  They didn't start the wave, they simply rode it.

Your anger is misdirected at a whole generation, when it should be directed at the mature economy and technology and slowing innovation.  Also the few in C-Suites that offshored their labor or automated jobs out entirely.

  As well as sociopolitical groups that invaded the education system and made people believe identity politics and social movements were more important than math, science, and technology.   Also the education system is a lot weaker than it was -- lots of bar lowering to appease sociopolitical groups so little jermaine can keep up with johnny, on paper.

Now we have a society thats dumb and angry they can't find high paying work because the work they're suited for moved overseas, they're not qualified for, or pays less domestically due to competition globally.  That or was automated out entirely thanks to improved technology.  

Plus the allowance of foreign investors to buy tracts of land and housing, which drives up the cost for everyone else domestically that just wants a place to live in.

But the amount of people in control of these things is miniscule generationally.  Many many many more people just had a quiet life of 9-5 and raising kids in the boomer era.
Tsla
But the thing is the one example you just provided, more testing, wouldn't slow anything. Between the false positive rate and doing testing. Idr the exact number but it was like half the people who have the virus are asymptomatic right? So what, someone who is completely fine tests positive - now we have to isolate them for weeks? For the less than 1% of the pop who is actually at risk?
If you believe that's a solution that's fine, but it's a solid argument for both sides. Simply saying every single death is cause of 1 sides argument is again, lazy.

Jesus you are in the mega green zone my man
Yeah full agree honestly, I think the stock is safely valued above like 25 for the near future, will be interesting to see if/when squeeze hits and also if a big recovery can be executed. I dont think 100+ is out of the question if we see some nice plans moving forward. Keep in mind just how little has been done to innovate at gme for 10 years. They were built in a different era and have done nothing but increase the amount they overcharge. There is currently free real estate over the next couple of years for them to do something right. 


But yeah, there's a reason it was the most shorted stock.
Quick question about buying calls..

If I wanted to buy a call option that expires on Feb 5 (strike 11) for asking price of $1.38, would I be paying $138 up front to purchase the call option (1 contract of 100 shares)? Once the contract is initiated, i'm assuming my max loss would be the premium paid of $138, and my max gain is unlimited?

I'm not buying the option since I don't fully understand it yet but it seems this would be the case.
I realized the general public doesn’t give a shit about their rights and privacy after Prism. My conscience was clear to invest in infotech, data analysis, and defense after that.
You legit retarded or just pretending?
I don't know shit about stock exchange, but anybody thinking that funds will not fight for every $, and will take massive losses just like that is a retard, even by standard of this forum. Rollercoaster ahead.

You should invest within your own personal risk tolerance level. Since you say you’re a nervous little fucker, I’d say no, do not go all in on GME. It can go down in price just as quickly as it went up. I don’t personally think it’ll tank that much and do believe it’ll increase over the next 4 to 6 months. But what do I know, I’m just a gambler like the rest of the tards here on WSB. Seriously though, maybe limit your personal exposure by allocation a portion of your available funds to GME or set tight stops so you will not put yourself in a position of having a devastating short term loss in case things start heading south. GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Looks like he posted a SA comment yesterday directly addressing this:

"To anyone that thinks that Gabe, from Melvin Capital, somehow reached out to me and negotiated some deal for me to sell shares to him... let me put that to bed... It didn't happen.

First of all - I do not run a fund with comingled assets. I manage separately managed accounts that are all invested identically. Could you imagine trying to do a transaction outside the regular course of market and having to go to nearly 100 individuals to get approvals? And for what? My shares were not sold for a premium. I sold with a limit order, and I have no idea who purchased the shares.

Additionally - if Gabe had come to me of all people - with total holdings of less than 1% of all shares outstanding - do you really think I would have sold? That would have been the ultimate sign of desperation, and I would have broadcast it to the world.

So lets put the rumors to rest once and for all - I have had zero interaction with Melvin Capital."
I know right
Again? 🤡
I would venture to say that half of the people buying into tesla aren't investing in tesla, they're investing in Elon. If he does come out with a holding company, that shit will blast the moon in a heartbeat.

Lol, they have it capped at 100 million offering. At 30/share that's 3.3 million in extra stock with 70 mil +short. Unless I'm severely mistaken I don't see an extra 3 million in stock changing much. It also sets a price floor for all those buying in a stock offering at 30.

Hell even if issuing more stock at 20/share that's 5 million more in stock supply. That's supposed to give 70 million short an out??
Exactly lol! Hehehe
I actually understood this. 35 dollars seems like a steal, short squeeze or long (if RC gets his way). Plus being in the UK (strong pound/weak dollar FUCK KNOWS why the UK is currently clusterfucking everything at the moment) this is even better value at less than 30 pounds a share.

Is $33 a good entry if it gets down there? Might set a buy order
I've never invested in it those triple leveraged etns scare me but seems like it's at a dip. I checked to see what the other 5 companies they had were too I can never remember and Baidu and Alibaba I like

Just wanted to chip in and mention that I bought in with my meagre life savings at 19.20 last November when GME was rocketing up from 16 and wsb was saying "the short squeeze is NOW". Turns out I bought the top and it crashed down to 12+. It stung quite a bit then, but I sold puts and calls and bought more shares to lower my cost basis

Now 19.20 feels more like a bottom than a top. Y'all can get through this. See you on the other side, brother
how about a weekly poll , to check/estimate the amount of GME  Shares owned by WSB ?
I have no clue. You have 2 days to figure out. Im UK based and im a Trading 212 retard

It’s supposed to re-contextualize the world. Reiner et all really thought they were saving the world by breaking the walls, it’s to show that it’s much more morally gray than the 2d view we were presented with in the beginning. You can’t blame them for what they did, but they’re still the enemy, but they’re human too.

You "retards" ran Hertz, how much SI was there? I rode the GME run with my cheapest share price of $2.97 which I sold in the $6s, then buying at $4 Blah Fn Blah. I sold 2/3 position in the $30s and trying to read the tea leaves. Unlucky's post basically said 1=1, and confirmed nothing.

&#x200B;

So with RHs and retail 20% instead of 10%, why is the assumption that retail can't ruin these F-head greedy shorts that didn't cover in the $2s? I am sure Hertz had fund shorts too. 20% of the entire market is a lot more than big hedgefunds, who can F off and go out of business with their naked shorting. Hedging here is awful.

&#x200B;

The tape does not show a 70m shares covering BTW, way too much shorting at open, throughout day. Selling huge chunks tanking SP a few $$ is NOT how one "usually" take profits. Been there done that.

I hear what you're saying but that's not comparable at all. Apple isn't solely relying on 5G to pan out. They have multiple growth channels and a cult following.

I day trade the shit out of NOK but I'll never hold it long term.

This was like two years ago lol. Big doubt. I’ve seen it multiple times. I’ve also seen kids having “sex” through chat and entire game modes dedicated to kids fucking. It’s a mess.
In honesty, as much as I want to say yes, do not do that. If it was last Monday I’d say sure but at this point things are going to get volatile and your money might be stuck in GME for a couple weeks. Or god forbid something comes up and you have to liquidate your position to pay for bills. Be smart. Just 💎✊🏾 whatever you currently own.

All I can think "Get a lawyer and shut the fuck up"
Which Tuesday
First point is shares held in margin can and will be lent out to shorts when they’re trying to short. Second point is brokers have already started increasing margin requirements some of them completely eliminating GME on margin which leads to a dump in shares, helping them again to short and/or cover when the squeeze comes.
there's other ways but okay

I sold a some covered calls on CRSR about a month ago. It has really good premiums for sure. You could immediately write some covered calls on Tuesday if you really want to protect yourself from some down side. However I think it's going to start crawling back up leading into earnings next month. Also, the IV should start going up too, making the premiums even better. Wait for a green day on it if you can and write some calls.
I am SO confused right now.

buying shares in GameStop. I use stash but Robin Hood or something else is probably better and just buying up all the shares you can afford with at least the hope that they will double - retards on this group are saying it's going to shoot up even more than that so to hold hoping a share would go up to $400 to $600 or more then selling for profit.
FUCK MELVIN. Toooooo thaaaa mooooooon
Yup, he can sell covered calls (weekly way OTM).  Even 25% OTM is still about 75 cents.   I'm just gonna guess he has 14,000 shares of TSLA.   That's $10K a week.  Imo he should sell at least a few million and actually diversify.

Amazon and YouTube are handling the streaming already, that is not getting cracked. All Twitch streams link to Amazon sales.

You clearly haven't been paying attention ;), the original characters have been in every episode infiltrating Marley.  Jean was at the end of episode one, Eren the injured soldier, Armin is the tall disguised soldier etc.

Its noce to be free - I dont buy shit with money I dont have, dont use credit cards only for gas/what I can cover to build credit...its worked. 745 score and 0 debt.....That was Goal #1  is not to have to carry any debt around with me especially with what I'm trying to accomplish. I figured that was smarter than you know taking out loans for shit right now.
That’s not GME...
Wouldn’t mind it either. MOASS would be extremely life changing and it could then transition into a slow squeeze as well since shorts are gonna start shorting again when the MOASS ends but even if it doesn’t slow squeeze could be epic if we 5-10x in the next year
If you don't you might regret it for ever. If you do and it shits the bed you're only down 1200. Pretty good risk there if you ask me.

This has a lot of room to run. I’m not saying don’t enter into any trades on GME. I’m saying buy shares, keep calm, don’t be disappointed if mad profits don’t happen this week, don’t paper hand and sell only to find out it spiked a week later.

Got assigned on the NIO $60 put and CRSR $40 put. Do I sell some CCs Tuesday or wait for them to pop before selling CCs?
I lost 15k movement not violent enough. Made 5k on a new position but such is options life. Cant have that asymmetric reward with some of this. The mistake was to use one week and not zero day expiry. I figured the selling would be later in day but it was earlier. I’ll know for next Friday if it’s a factor again. May not be.

Amazon, at the time of Chewy, (and actually a lot of other companies) was not into all of the products that it is into now. I wish there was a simple sticky that said, "CHEWY WAS NOT ACTUALLY COMPETING WITH AMAZON AT THE TIME OF IT'S CREATION OR SALE." because it's true, the only competitors really were Barnes&Noble and other book sellers; while Amazon was working on it's logistics (which was really what was being formed then) nothing else actually died because of Amazon. Nothing. 

Ryan Cohen did not overcome Amazon or anyone else at the time because the distribution channels (and actually, the technology for them) didn't actually exist in 2006. It did not exist until about 2012 actually, 6 years later, where you could do this on a scale that wasn't restricted by sheer warehouse capacity and guess who made that happen? Amazon. Chewy was sold 5 years later to PetSmart but started 1 year earlier so before Amazon could create a sound foothold (i.e. Amazon Pantry) Chewy was already 3 or 4 years old and had it's brand established. In fact, if Chewy had continued to exist with Cohen, Amazon probably would have been the buyer a year or two later.

Same the boomers in my family think like this as well and tbh can’t get too mad at them cause it’s all they’ve known. For a lot of them they were alive when msm first started and it’s all they’ve ever cared to know.
thus fair "only invest what you can afford to lose" hahaha
A similar more conservative strategy is to do the opposite.  Set limit orders on the way up and slowly sell during the squeeze.  The potential for profits isn't as high, but you are also less likely to be bag holding.  Remember on the way down you don't just get to say "sell" and they are gone. Someone actually has to buy them.
It's the stock market. None of this is safe, ever, period.

"But cnn said..." 

No dad. The fucking okay symbol is not a nazi hand code. It was a 4 chan troll post that they baited the media with. 

"What's a 4chan? You mean a cave troll? You back on that coke shit?" 

Ugh boomers lol.
make sense for fngu calls rn?
Okay a few things
1) my trade may suck. It’s based on my view of wsb sentiment levels being at a peak that will take a breather even if this eventually goes to some more insane number. It may be wrong. This stock could moon this week.

2) vol is pricey but I don’t think it’s unfairly priced in this situation so I’m long vol. if I didn’t think that I would’ve sold call spreads or something. 

3) my assumption is most dealers are very short gamma. If untrue this analysis falls apart but Wednesday sure looks like short gamma on dealers. Notice how the stock struggled to continue up once gamma was low - no options over 40 on Wednesday, and things were parabolic. 

The thing to remember is that any short option is short gamma. You enter that short position and hedge by selling stock vs a short put and buying stock be a short call, but both have the same gamma at a given price for same strike. Gamma is the rate at which you have to buy/sell stock on price moves to hedge delta. 

If someone sells you an at the money put, they hedge by selling 50 shares short. If the price goes up, they have less liability and buy/cover. If they sell you a call and price goes up, they buy more to cover liability. Eventually they’d buy Max 50 shares or cover Max 50 shares from that point. So the gamma and buying patterns are synced for all short options held by dealers.
Hoo boy are you completely missing the point

How he was able to stay on the air after that "I'm sorry" I will never know.  Must see tv. http://www.cc.com/video-clips/0vqrim/the-daily-show-with-jon-stewart-jim-cramer-pt--1

Definition of roll 212.
Dude... look at the fucking chart and the volume!

The squeeze started this week. I know we are slow but this is too much.

Also Melvin was short with puts, not shares
Coward. 350% too much for you?
bought 420 shares on fridays dip.. let’s hope 🙏
Stated earlier, short sellers have a risk management threshold and if the stock price goes upe enough it will trigger them to buy back the shares and cut losses, causing the stock price to spike up as they close their short positions.
Yes. Cant go tits up. Sell on squeeze and buy more. Long to alpha centauri on the cohen rocket.
Cramer, of course
NO

People here are going to tell you yes, because they think they know what they're doing. Truth be told none of us know what we're doing, we just get super lucky.

You have the potential of losing all your money and being broke as fuck for a while. Don't blow it

What positions you got retard
Man, it sucks the markets are closed tomorrow. I was hoping for an NIO recovery. I miss NIO mooning 😖
Still you because you bought it on debt for gambling! It almost as likely you win it in an casino being in just one position!
Imagine it went wrong and you end up being a gay hooker for $5 to pay it off!
Thanks my man! Spread the word to others and please vote to keep before a melvin bot removes my post hahaha

Let’s go brother!
I’m confident at it being around $25 by June at the latest. Volume on Thursday and Friday was insane.
Summarized my thoughts, I'm hyped as fuck for this. This is literally the best, most obvious opportunity any of us have seen in our lifetimes. Id argue this is better and more obvious than going long post covid
You from CLE?
1. Still a good possibility of Tesla partnering with BB as spacex rockets use their QNX software.

2. Even if Tesla doesn’t partner with BB, BB is partnered already with majority of the EV market.
Don't we not know how much short interest changed? It's just speculation on what the big players are doing until the actual numbers are out.
>all shares

This is pretty much the opposite of the way
Oh fuck yeah
The fucking motley fool talking shit on gme is probably the #1 reason to go all in right now
Blackberry back when they were the short was known for their phone security. They sold off their phone patents and going towards software. Amazon And Sony already have deals in place with them
I'm already seeing way too many "you got your tendies from gme, now time for bb" style bs. 

Oh and im also seeing way too many gme "dd" that makes no sense at all. If i bought weeklies everytime a heavily upvoted dd mentioned the imminent short squeez, i'd be the most brokest person ever.
Its gonna be G again as the #1 I think but I'd go with K out of those two unless you're really bearish on Tesla its 10% of K

My man! Team $BB has nice 🚀 make you go so high.
I need a 1000% play next week, any ideas?
200 shares rhats about all I can do
It literally doubled last week. Y’all just want us to pump it because it ain’t hit 40

Ps4 releases 2013. New cycle begins now with Ps5. Its a large bullish segment for GME as they make tons of revenue in this time period.

When I bought in initially I was going for the biggest return possible. I still am, now that it's actually happening I'm not changing my plans. Started as a real YOLO and it's gonna die a real YOLO.
That was a troll post lol, one of us
All EVs are in a bubble rn its like the hot speculation industry IMO. Clean energy should be fire this year. Next big trend Biogenetics? Might hop in soon
Thanks - and there’s still time for some catalyst (think Cohen tweeting “fuck the shorts”). It’s ok to have faith and keep your fingers crossed as long as you don’t go full retard.
I do treat gig income as money I dont have. I treat all my savings like something I dont have and I am on a budget. I even moved in with a friend in a shithole neighborhood to save even more. Dont tell me what to do when you dont know wtf Im doing asshole lol
MF shit talking = upgrade
Forgot to add then YOLO all gains in PLTR and BB
All of the above
Yup. I cant use it to solve the black scholes but I get the underlying theory.

Solid trade off to not have to worry about gettin an outrageous 90 day ban.
It's very reasonable expectation, but why would price crash after stock offering?

They are raising money because they expect to make even more after that.

Didn't TSLA do that two times, even frothy MARA diluted their shit and stock price did not flinch.

Any reason why a passive fund wouldn’t sell to rebalance after the run up? We already saw one of the outgoing board members had to sell to rebalance his fund. If passive funds need to rebalance this could increase the real float out there

I really did not understand the GME hype until someone said it will basically become the new micro center. This makes 100% sense to me, there is a real unfilled niche for PC gaming hardware as micro centers do not have good geographic coverage. That said, all the stuff everyone wants right now is sold out everywhere, so what will they sell?
My son Bracedyn is my world
Can anyone explain the reasoning behind switching from a margin to cash robinhood account? Also, GME to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀
Might be an ignorant question but why would that create a price floor? Is it because you're saying he'd push the price back up?
Also 24, doing my part!
That's blasphemy! It's never to "early" to drink.
True on the stores, but they are reducing expenses and slowing the bleed.  This is all part of the pivot. The thing to glean from all of this is they aren’t about to go under.  They have enough assets to cover their debts, period. It’s just facts.

Switching to a more profitable model and shifting to e-commerce is the way they survive and grow. Will they do it?  Maybe.  Mix all the potential together and add in a massive short position and you start to see things like last week. 

As stores close and expenses drop, their financial statements will improve.  Good news from the board restructuring could trigger a massive amount of shorts covering and a squeeze.

I don’t disagree with where you are coming from. I don’t have the thought process of “GameStop is the future!”  It might bring about some really cool things eventually, but this is a tendie play for me.  If they were in much worse shape and unable to cover their debts, I wouldn’t be in it.
Those will all expire worthless
Maybe it’ll be more like untying a balloon 🚀🚀 than popping a bubble

It'll be the best money you ever spend. Do it. What's money for if not to buy the things we want.
Yeah there are a lot of high expectations for earnings while they may beat they probably won’t meet expectations.
Yeah I dont think you can compete head to head. Thing is, Game stop has the name and history. They also already have locations everywhere. How is Amazon going to compete with an in person event. Idk how to capitalize on it, but you at least remember going and standing in line for like skyrim or halo amd shit. People were hype. It was fun. Then everyone raced home to play. But now people seem to just watch streams before even jumping in. 


Imagine release day where you had 10 screens with the top streams running. I think the angle is take 1 out of every 10,000 people from twitch chat and put them in the store buying candy and picking up a new controller. We'll have to see what the plans are, but if the company was worth $X doing jack shit for 10 years except overcharging for used games, id have to imagine its not hard to move that value up some with minor innovations, let alone a chewy-like transformation.

Honestly, this might be a stretched out squeeze that starts taking off after earnings in March. Everything is pointing towards that date in my head. Melvin won't be able to afford to cover a MOASS situation due to available capital meaning a lot of people will be left holding the bag. It might be the plan to allow the shorts to naturally unwind their positions so as to gradually pay off their naughty naked shortselling.

The brutal truth, good work
What’s this?? We don’t need finance and economics to tell us this my man. Look for clues such as 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀, GME, PLTR, Tesla for market prediction.
You guys need to quit playing analysts (because so many of you are abysmal at it). Here are some physical realities:

>The digital game sales argument, like all 🐻 arguments, are weak. The shift to digital will possibly occur in the next console cycle.

This has already happened. It's actually why Gamestop *fell to $4 to begin with with some points being as low as just under $3.* The bull case is **this will change** not that this hasn't occurred. The one thing that makes me wonder if GME will survive is that almost everyone who is in it "for long" really isn't very educated on Gamestop.

You're telling yourself a total lie; for instance, " Brick and mortar retail is dead. Gamestop locations are shutting down left and right, this must mean they're going bankrupt.", is not actually false. That's also what happened on the way to $4. They didn't have the revenues to keep going and sitting like a dragon on cash is not going to save you from a death of thousand papercuts, they would have eventually run out of money if nothing changed, and on top of this even Cohen himself, the supposed savior, is going *against the B&M model* which means that even he agrees it's dead.

The reality is that you have mixed two statements and they don't actually flow properly.

"Brick and mortar retail is dead.", is absolutely true and is not going to change.

"Gamestop locations are shutting down left and right, this must mean they're going bankrupt.", is what's being sought to be changed. A shift to digital means a distinct closing of stores.
You expect me to know how to read? Do you know where you are?

Yeah it was kinda expected that there would be a kickback because a 40% rally over 2 days Isn’t realistic, it encourages too much profit taking. It will go back up again eventually. Just hold for a year and BB will be $30-$50

great post! A comment on the digital game trade-in section. 

You mention it is far fetched that a game developer would be into this. I believe it’s a great idea since they currently only profit from the original game sale and as it stands, there isn’t any way for them to profit further off a digital game. Unlike a disc that can have a healthy resold life, the digital sale is over on day 1.

If GS were to be the first hub of used digital game buyback program that offered devs a cut of the used game credit, it would give them an incentive to participate as this is a new revenue stream. 

I have several games on Steam I have no intention of playing but also have no incentive to get rid of the license since it’s currently valueless. Sure, Steam could just turn around and do this, but I wouldn’t be able to sell my xbox or PS games at Steam. GS could be the ultimate hub.

Don't pay attention to stock price - consider the market cap. At it's highest market cap (8-9 billion I believe), that would put the stock at around 160-ish. But they had more outstanding shares back then which is why you see an ATH stock price at 60.

Nice idea. But they can close out a position without buying the underlying share. This isn’t fool proof. The people pumping are watching and will sell at those levels.

Hey thanks for asking. I got through a decent chunk of the first book of Expedition Force. I also listened to a lot of podcasts and part of The Richest Man in Babylon. I can't remember if there was anything else. I bought a couple more but didn't get to those
They still are, west coast starts at 10 for football
Let's say a company has 100 shares. The outstanding shares are 100

Let's say the short position is 90. That means the short percentage of outstanding is 90/100 = 90%

However, even if there's 100 shares out there, some shares may be held by large institutions. Think hedge funds, pension funds, even ETFs. These slow-moving big players can't easily sell a significant portion of their shares at the drop of a hat. These large investors have to report their holdings and major sales and purchases, and thus the info on these groups are publicly available. They're very unlikely to be sold during a short squeeze because these large players and funds are almost forced to be 💎✋ just by design

Let's say 70 out of the 100 shares are owned by these large investors

The float is only 100 - 70 = 30 shares. 30 shares that actually have a significant 📄✋ chance

Short percentage of float is 90/30 = 300%

Hope this helps

Loved reading your post from an academic standpoint. I still don't understand some things but I am trying to google things and then come back to your post to see if it makes sense. 
You clearly have a lot of knowledge on how gamma works. While I understand the structure of gamma, I get a little confused in using it in the grand scheme of things. 
For e.g. what MMs will need to do when they are extremely short gamma (adding short calls and short puts). On the short call side, they will have to buy the stock to cover but on short put side, they will have to sell stock to cover. And your opinion is that MMs are selling more to cover the puts because puts are high in demand for whatever reasons (protection or speculative) which will cause the stock to push lower? Then why would prices need to accelerate on extremely short gamma? Sorry if this is not what you meant and if it is not worth your time explaining things eli5, I would really appreciate it if you could point me in the right direction for the stuff I should read to get more understanding on this.
I am very interested in understanding of the gamma as I feel it could provide early signals (due to MMs activity) on where the market could go in the future and hence would like to build a solid foundation on it.

Given the implied volatility on this, why would you buy expensive puts? Wouldn't short calls be better? Or you don't want the margin to kick in on short plus limited earning potential?

Assuming I am writing this on Thursday (one day before the expiration), the gamma would be the highest for ATM options. But given that a lot of people wouldn't have the capital to exercise that many calls would sell/roll their calls would result in MMs no longer needing the shares and will dump them promptly. This will be true for any stock so what is so special with GME? Those that were significantly ITM wouldn't affect gamma much anyway, right?

I still have a lot to ask but I also don't want to sound like a total dumb at this. I realize I am so late responding to this that my post may not be read by you or others who could help. But all in all, just know that there are people on a weird autistic spectrum on this sub that really do appreciate posts like these and want to encourage you to write more and more stuff like this. Thanks so much.

Not necessarily or not as soon as u might think, a passenger aircraft’s flight life is set by regulators at the FAA, once that aircraft hits that set number of flight hours it must be retired no matter what condition it’s in, with the pandemic there have been less flights which means the airlines can push back their aircraft replacement cycles (in this case I’m guessing a full year maybe a little more)

Rolls Royce. A lot of their revenue is service based, so the engines are already in the aircraft, they just need to get up in the air again for the revenue to start again. It's based on servicing after x miles. Not reliant on airlines expanding existing fleets (which won't happen until they have money again), and not reliant on specific airlines doing better than others.

Does anyone have any idea what BB is going to do? I feel like it will profit nicely in a few months as long as you have a few hundred shares, but why do people think it's going to 🚀🚀🚀🚀?
I don’t like the extra attention.  Setting us up to take any blame from SEC for things like GME
I think that’s more of a federal government decision?
Shut up Meg
Warning: this creates a short term cap gains event if you sell the call. If you exercise or wait until expiration in the money, the Profit of the option trade just rolls into the stock. If you are gonna hold for over a year, this can make a huge difference in taxes. 

It only makes sense to sell early and buy the stock if there is a very significant amount of time value left in the option.
If you're in for the squeeze just buy shares at Tuesday open.

The argument isn’t about day 1, the argument is about skipping downloading content by buying a disk.

Scenario A: digital purchase:

Download 60GB for the game. Download 5 GB Day 1 patch.

Scenario B: physical purchase:

Buy the game and install it say 30GB for argument’s sake even tho you can get like 60GB with blueray. Download remaining 30GB , download 5GB day 1 patch.

You effectively skipped 30/65 GB.

I am completely new to all of this, so you intend to invest 2k$. What would be the worst case scenario that could happen and what would be the amount of money you could get out of it if its going "well" and what if you get really lucky? Is there someone who could explain that to me like ELI5?
I say the same thing if you're a hard-core gamer like I am you and I both know you aren't replaying shkt don't lie to yourself

Well the Nokia today has nothing to do with the former Nokia. Nokia now is a network company like cisco. Nokia and Ericsson will benefit from 5G and connected cars. For many people without visions it’s to far away from their imagination or knowledge. They only think about the motor, diesel, gas, electric. But they don’t think about the possibilities and future technologies with IOT. 🤷‍♂️ Nokia will go to the moon in a few years. I said the same about nvdia and amd 10 years ago and I said it about Blackberry. All people thought I‘m crazy. Now the stocks gained a lot of 🤷‍♂️ Doesn’t matter what others say. If you believe in it buy it and hold it.
I still can’t tell if Cramer keeps drawing attention to wsb because he likes us or if he’s trying to get the whole thing shut down.

Read the post about gamestop build a ~bear~ pc. And their pivot to have dedicated store changes and how fast they sell stuff. All RC has to do is to say he bought the last 7%, which he has capital for, and to reveal their plans.

New Yorkers keep weed illegal so that they can arrest poor people who would otherwise pose a physical threat to them. It's also useful for blockbusting.
A lot of that is priced in.  LUV, JBLU and ALGT are prolly the best plays.  ERJ is also waaayyyy undervalued.
You can't really exercise naked puts without owning/borrowing shares to sell and even then, it's better to sell at market when the puts are ITM

Going through these Cramer videos, it's so very obvious how his pandering is such bullshit and his nonstop mentioning of us is to fill this sub with much more noise.  He's been best buddies with the scum of the earth at wall street for like 30 years and even has old interviews where he admits to being a pos too. This is one snek we should step on.

I said the same last week when I dumped 12k on 2/19 calls. Down 50% at the moment.
The physical console is to appease people who flipped out last generation when Microsoft announced an all digital ecosystem. The fact is physical sales in stores fell 8% last year and digital sales were up 45%. So gaming is growing as a market just not in store bought games. GME is making the right move to pivot out of it, hopefully its not too late.
This is what I would post as well but recently we have been full of idiots who are yoloing their life savings because they saw a gain porn on r/all or Cramer mentioned this sub.

Turn the "every corner gamestop of trash used games" into a 2-a-city microcenter-like place where you can buy pc parts, then also have events in the store and get exclusive deals to become the premier location for selling consoles and gaming in general. Throw in some release parties for hot titles and discounted games through their online store. Maybe let people hang with a community of gamers during big streams instead of sitting on twitch chat at home. 


I'll be the first to admit that the gme thing is currently just a technical anomaly. BUT it was severely undervalued. It doesn't take much to move a stock to the upside. The price is forward thinking. If they say "we have big plans to do this stuff" the stock price will rise. In 4 years when that all fails to create revenue, it will drop back.


Gaming is also a crazy big industry so taking back even a small portion of it is exceptionally valuable.

Damn son
Buy a call option instead then if you don't have the capital to invest in stocks

Because to be completely honest  only 50 shares will get you pennies, stocks really aren't worth it if you don't have a lot of capital (minimum 10000) to invest, sure a lot will say "start small and build up" but you are best off saving money up instead to have a fund to invest qith
Its gonna be annoying for every DD to have "this is the next GME"
you are right, but trading sideways for 9 weeks, then jumping 300%, then trading sideways for 9 weeks....i wouldn't call that 'hugely wrong' or a 'failed bet' as OP asked.
Why not? I've got some July 16c
Read all of it. Your kids will thank you
Go ahead and Sell @ 400. Then watch my limit sells get filled @1425. If WSB and retail only hold 10% of shares (7M) how are the shorts going to cover the other 63M shares? I am hoping they just take every order available on the book at some point lol 😆.

All stores are on lease, there is no cash there. Also we are talking about Assets vs Liabilities not just cash. By closing a store you eliminate a revenue stream.

Their current plan is emailing their loyalty points club about the location of the nearest remaining Gamestop location after a store closes. Color me not excited.

There is 1 micro center about 1 hour from me. There are 3 GameStop’s within 15 mins of me.

Big 6 Canadian Banks. They haven't cut dividends in 80 years and are currently sitting on a pile of cash thanks to covid fears in 2020. Some plan to use this to invest in growing their US market share through acquisitions while others plan special dividends/stock buybacks once the regulators allow it. Our banks are run very conservatively and will never be allowed to fail because they truly are too big to be allowed to fail.

Yearly Dividends alone are 4.5% on average and the average 5Y Growth has been around 40%.
time to sell them naked puts for some passive income.
Sell out completely at $100, count yourself lucky and then take that money and diversify it into a bunch of different stocks. You can always buy more GME after it crashes down to $25 - $30.
this is maybe a good lead ... thanks! will check it out.

All about people supporting the cause and fuck Melvil and Frankfurt but if you all think everyone here is going to come up way on top on GME while buying in @ 30 or 40 then you guys are delusional. I bought in with $100 into gme for the cause too but no one should go in 100%.
GME has reached the cap guys... what the hell would make it worth over 40 other than a squeeze??

Many mentions of Netflix in this post. Let's be very clear - this pile of steaming feces is NOT Netflix. It's not Netflix from 5 or 10 years ago either. It's not HBO, it's not Disney+, it's none of that. It's Sling TV, except with 1/5th of the subs that Sling TV has. This is the same BS hypetrain that led to this stock being blown sky high right after IPO. THankfully, somebody spoke sense. I'm in the VMVPD business (if you can call it a business) and it's a shitty universe to be a part of. The economics are fragile and the industry is fragmented. There's absolutely nothing special that services like Sling, Fubo, Philo, Youtube TV, etc offer. It's your grandma's cable, piped over the internet. Pluto TV is the new linear landscape, where you can get tons of channels, digitally programmed by the streamer (not a bloated media company yearning for margins from the 90s) and changed constantly. Plus, people are fundamentally moving from traditional linear viewing to VOD (which Fubo does not really offer).

The vigtory acquisition is a red herring. It's either delusion from the ceo or a smart financial move to enable pump and dump chumps like you.
Fubo TV, with its 500k subs, is not shaking up the sports betting world. If you're convincing yourself of this, you're a moron.

Rich Greenfield wasn't opportunistic, he was the only one that spoke any bloody sense. Bunch of idiots out there like you comparing this dump to Netflix. What. The. Holy. Phuck.

Bottomline: if this is so special, i'm investing everything in Dish Network because they own the #1 vMVPD service.
Yea, that's what I tell my self (the first part) but I don't think I'd find someone better. As I said in the original comment, the only women I've been able to get are bottom barrel.

They are generating less income.  As long they aren’t increasing their debt liabilities, which they are not, they can cover with the cash on hand.  They are closing stores and liquidating those assets, and still hold the ability to generate cash via a stock offering. They aren’t a bankruptcy risk and are primed for a pivot on the business model fueled by Cohen.

All of this mixed in with the massive short position of ~138% is why this is all a thing. 

If this were anything like blockbuster, where they had around $700M in debts and no way to cover them, this would be a different story.

Put it out there just as much as a reminder to myself after this past week. I had mulitple bags on multiple plays and hoped theyd keep going up without any reason for them to aside from greed and hope and a desire to be right.

What’s the best bet for chiefs game gimme soemtjing 😭
I’m in about $5k which admittedly I bought high even by this dip’s standards so I’m bullish. Only thing that worries me is that the short interest data doesn’t indicate at what point the shares were shorted (at least not sources I’ve seen). Reasonable to think the old shorts are a sunk cost but what about ones shorting the current price point? Also, institutional shorts are not going to enter any position unhedged- how many of the calls actually belong to them?

Just dont buy on margin!
This is actually a mindest that only us poor people that are dying out have
Hahahaha yup
Um ..what? 
I  just made an observation. Don't take it personally lmao
The problem is the higher this thing goes the harder its gonna fall, most people here are being pumped into believing this isn't anything other than "screwing over shorts"

 Looking at game stop as just a business plan theoretically and  neglecting the fundamentals  there are way to many avenues into getting better deals .. most "neck beards" will buy their card stock off [TCGplayer.com](https://TCGplayer.com) or ebay or a local game store .. 

most "gamers" will start to get their games off the internet because its easier than having to go to GameStop  - believe it or not steam / xbox market place ALL have deals on games that aren't fully priced 

After the console rotation only because- they were and are impossible to find will this really come into effect much harder 

something about getting into computer parts? good luck with tigerdirect / newegg bestbuys price match 

I just hope people are treading here carefully Lol good luck bulls i've never been one to short anything - truly hope it works out just don't see it happening personally on all fronts
thanks that's what I was thinking
For sure...its very possible that it does with all the hype tho so dont listen to me.  I would also make some good money if it did.

You buy calls, they’re now negative delta. They buy the stock to get positive delta. You buy puts, they sell short to get back to delta 0.

Which chart? Any in particular?
True🤔
I think the idea is that since the shorts have to cover their positions, they do in fact have to buy your shares at whatever price you're charging e.g. $694.20 🚀
Do we have bans per minute?
First comment here, though I assure you I am indeed retarded. I have 1k powder to play with, I've transferred it to account and its to clear Tuesday. Im looking to YOLO it all on GME. Am I too late here? If the MOASS occurs Tuesday, does that leave me SOL if I purchase at Market open? Thanks & GLTA.
Wait can’t I just bet like 1000 bucks on a under 60 game and profit?

I think that tech will be stalled out for a bit, but soon people realize the money just ends up there if they give it to the people. They’ll be back in favor next quarter. This is invalidated if they go hard on antitrust stuff though.
I got in at $27 on a 'dip' and 10% stop dumped this week. Ironic that you need news for a pump...but the company is kinda based around secretive data collection and analysis. So, what kind news would ever leak? I don't think it pumps until it turns profits

0 shares here, just came to watch. So uh, where do you keep the popcorn again?
Why are shares on margin subject to the borrowing of shares for the shorties, versus non-margin stocks?
ITM are less volatile but OTM, if you are right about the stock going up, will have higher returns
Yeah that’s what I’m asking, obviously I don’t want it to hit that price so I keep my shares even though it would be a hair above what I paid for them.
Can someone explain like I"m a 5 year old retard on why it will continually go up?
You're gonna have to get that loan from Mommy for Tuesday then son, we have to keep the shorts crying. And that's requires more shares being bought

They are shoring up e price at any level above here. They won't let it dip like the sh💩tron and 💩tigroup downgrades. They know their numbers are solid and the Stock buybacks by the Founders is bullish af 101 Stonk theory.

My book had o/u 57.5.
Personally I think I got about 1.2k in margin on GME but I thankfully have enough cash in my portfolio/bank to recover it going -100%. I’m scared of a super quick short squeeze because the loss porn we’ll see here will be unreal

I agree that theoretically that all sounds logical. Just pointing out that one of OP's examples was Mithril making a similar filing on 12/23, and after the 23rd shares in PLTR began to drop from 28-29ish to 23-24ish

In 2-3 years, it will almost certainly be in the 100s.  But, its likely to go down/sideways before it goes up.  Its a long term play.

I’ve had to average down to $29.65. So getting out at 31.50 would bring a tiny profit and yeah I would go all in on a dip for sure.
By the Time i saw the ramp i was too handicapped to make the leap
If this happens, my 2 Gamestop shares would make me more tendies this year then my actual employer. GME to mars 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 Wallstreetbets will go to Pluto and beyond in 2021 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Yes but they are generating negative income. And up until recently it was at a significant pace.
I honestly see GME as a growth play now. Most of this board has gone full retard now when months ago they could have gotten in and be rich now. I have a real life friend in your situation I told him to buy in still with shares. Premiums are crazy on calls now and shares will be safest. I see where were at now as fair value for GME currently. With RC on board I'm expecting big things, I think were at $100 a share next year and I'm definitely sticking around after the squeeze settles down if it happens. Its a growth play with a potential squeeze bonus. I feel like if you buy tuesday and get shares or some leaps it will definitely pay, they have too many positive catalysts at the moment, just don't get paperhanded cuz its been a wild ride so far.

I’m worried this dumb app is gonna crash, getting 160 shares on Tuesday tho
What your bf said.
Nothing better than a rimjob to start your day
Bro, I would sell on a $200 spike just to cut a profit to buy back in when it dips. Sell on a $400 spike people. You can buy even more stock after you let it dip back. FOMO isn't real if you got big money from it.

You’re confusing cash flow and balance sheet. They are above 1.0, meaning they have enough cash and assets to cover their debts as is.

Exaaaactly what I’m thinking, although “it’s volatile” rings true and makes sense. But the terrifying scenario for them is what you just described.
You had me at OK retards! 500 shares, might buy some more with ITM puts.
If ur asking if I think it will be $31.50 by the end of the week, I do not, but I'm also an idiot.

Is GME even traded in the europoor markets?
I just don’t know if I Wana get the over or the under on the chiefs :-( lost on the bills over yesterday
Payback? You must be poor.

Rich folks never repay loans. Why worry about paying back when your assets are appreciating faster than debt? Rich folks keep borrowing and borrowing more and more. You're borrowing at 1-2% above fed funds rate and your assets are growing at 4-8%.

There are many ways to grow your money. Real estate is one, stock market is another. Business is a third option and youtubing or social media influencer is yet another. Only youtube and social media do not require startup funds. All three former options require some form of debt financing for scaling it to legendary status. 

I recommend picking up a finance or business for dummies books and reading.

Gen z’er with E*TRADE. I refuse to use robinhood after what happened to the 19 yo who was in the red 700k on a margin glitch
Also started with 1k in October. Up to 3.7k. Current goal is to eclipse the PDT threshold + 1k then take out my original deposit and play on just house money until I get filthy rich or lose it all
This is the way.
20 sounds like a reasonable goal
Pltr has twice the valuation and half the revenue as TYL

That means they are favored to win by10.5 points. So if you make that bet, you need them to win by 11 or more to win

The drop from 36 to, say, 15-30 wouldn’t be *too* disastrous but a shitshow nonetheless. Now, 100+ to 20-30? Don’t think any broker wants to experience a death by 1000 autists

OTM all day
Not sure if anyone else checked this, but I'm getting completely different numbers from my IBKR account.   
[https://imgur.com/gesbjQh](https://imgur.com/gesbjQh)  
1.2m shares with high rates and only 6 lenders with inventory. I could be wrong but wouldn't that mean that the 1.2m shares is across all 6 available lenders, not just IBKR inventory?
Depends on how many shorts cover. I’d be curious what the big longs are willing to give some lifeboats away for. I’ve pretty much always had a price target of $60-$120 half and half with my limit sells but I may modify that. I may just sell 40% of my shares at $69 and let the rest ride on the way up if it does squeeze. My dick was so hard seeing the 80% increase with only 5-10% of the short interest covering.
I want to believe.
Damn right brother!

I am absolutely a beginner to options, I’ve sold exactly one so far but I’m selling covered calls meaning I own 400 shares, I’m selling 4 bundles of 100 shares if they hit x price.

If they don’t hit x price I get a premium and my shares, if they do hit x price I keep the premium but have to sell my shares at x price.
Absolutely not, this is up BIGLY next week. Wait until Daddy Cohen starts swinging his massive chode on Melvin shorts with an announcement.

🙏🏽thx
Based on previous examples, 100x price when shit started seems reasonable. GME bottomed out around $4, so I think that's why you're seeing a lot of the $400, $420, etc. Realistically, nobody knows
BABA is where I’m dripping my gains
also waiting for ARKX
If u bought high 31 is good id say cus u collect premium and u have cash free’d up. Pltr will go down again and go back up higher
At least at TDA margin percentages are based on realized volatility.  That is why when a meme stock runs up 10% in a day your required margin percentage will go up even though your margin maintenance excess is way up.  Happens all he time on GME when it goes up big.  My point is that I don't think the increased margins mean much of anything other than realized vol on GME is very high.
Yep
no
So our greed and lack of sophistication and not their greed and lack of hedging risk, lead to their loss. Yes. Yes. Pass the buck time.

That's the thing though with Tesla. It IS the next best thing. No other EV coming out is as "cool" with new tech. Even stupid shit like fart noises in the car, games, dog mode, etc gets people excited and interested. Legacy auto makers are too boring, and are reluctant to take risks. Tesla keeps innovating to still be the next best thing.

They mean the rule is only in effect until market close Tuesday
I want to start by saying that I'm not a brilliant retard like so many of you, I wanted to say that I had no connections to the market when I took office, but that might change.  Even though I don't actively participate, I've seen you from time to time when you make waves.  TSLA of course was a no brainer way to make a lot of money with a great company that needed a cash infusion, but your moves to prop up GME seem foolish to me as it's a company that should have died long ago.  I even saw that at one point the CCP attempted to have you boost up a company that amounted to a TSLA forgery, thankfully the mods stopped that one, but not the GME nonsense.  I should also acknowledge that what I'm about to ask you to do may not be okay with the SEC, I don't know but frankly I just see it as capitalism and consumers making choices with their dollars.

Which brings me to what I'm going to ask you all to do, what I'm going to ask a bunch of retards to do in order to bring about a positive change in the world.  I want you to make  NSRGY crumble.  I'm sure most of you already know about NSRGY and their business practices, everything from child labor to stealing water, the memes for this one write themselves as they're literally doing what the Bond villain Dominic Greene did in Quantum of Solace.  For those of you with connections to "opinion news" outlets, a story should be made that since we have a new incoming administration in the USA that hints at the possibility that NSRGY might be sanctioned for these practices and that it's become an incredibly risky investment instead of a buy and hold stock with a dividend.

Should you choose to accept this mission, we wish you retards good hunting.  America and the world is depending on you here.

First of all, big congrats! We want two kids but financially i don’t think we ever could. I’m already 32 and no clue when we’ll be even able to find the first one. I mostly just want her smile to come back(don’t get me wrong I want a child too) but man, after we lost the one pregnancy we managed to get, it devastated us. She took it really hard so now I’m paying to get her counseling on top of all this and I just can’t seem to find the light. It’s a struggle but I’m keeping my head up mostly, I want this. 
Again though that’s so awesome you guys did it! I can’t wait for those late nights lol

Thanks man - best of luck. Sounds like you dodged divorce, lawyer fees, alimony and child support all in one decision. I’m sure you’re in the middle of a lot of drama now, but in the grand scheme of things it’s nothing to compared to a divorce.
Or they realize that both of these things are likely, so lets cut off margin in case either of one happens
what's up with BB? and should i get in?
Don't stop loss, they will try to bust you out by dropping the price
$30,000 in $GAB would make you $375 a month. These people are so fucking dumb
I just feel like, in general, shares are much better to buy as long as you can buy a few hundred  of them at least. It feels safer and the volume that you buy at allows for gainz that are sever al magnitudes better than most no education/no training day jobs out there. Shares buy you the luxury of sitting and waiting on the red days; skipping a whole week or two if you feel like it. 

Options on GME feel insane either way at the moment. Just buy the damn shares and hold them.
Share this to bears and bulls alike. Spread the true word fellow soldier.

Yeah I’m thinking Chiefs under 56 points
Take the number of short shares, and calculate how many calls that would require. Take a look at the OI across the chain and see if there’s anything close in the size required. 

Also the shorting strategy may not have used calls in order to maximize profit. Believe it or not, there are institutional retards.

He likely has hedges. But "just buy calls to hedge" is oversimplifying things.


Because calls are very expensive rn. He has to pay insane inrerest on his short position, if he also bleeds call-theta this shit gets really expensive.


If he hedges with calls, he'll probably use calls that are fat OTM & that have a lot of time left to minimize theta decay



There are some big downsides to hedging your shorts well. Either you still have a lot of downside or your downside is limited well and you bleed a lot of interest+time decay
This is where I am at.  Just want to make enough to pay if mine and my girls student loans.  About $40k,, and then I can breath a sigh of relief.

Tableau does facial recognition? Lol ive been in big data for quite awhile. Multiple AWS transformations for household name companies. Collibra is the standard governance tool. Tableau is data viz. plenty of data science platforms that run R and Python. Integration can be handled in multiple ways but candidly weve not made measurable progress away from classic datamarts via redshift in many cases. Unless youre a tech company who needs data to  run your business. The AWS world has plenty of native apps but its diverse. PLTR brings it all together in one place. Tell me again what you know about the industry. You sound like a user who saw an early version of the UI and have little insight beyond the surface.
Sell the shit out of them. Not going to be a big run up until they make some profits. Which won't be next earnings it the one after what. Going to be around $20 for a while

I'm in a few thousand now as well, debating yoloing half of my 401k into it Tuesday (10k). I just want my non retirement amount to hit about 50k so I can pay off all our debt. Anything over than that will just be nice to get a jump start on a house down-payment.
Not sure, I don't sell options.  I heard "possibility of infinite loss" back when I started trading, and just refused to learn.

I’m expecting a neutral scenario like tesla, where Ryan cohen improves gme and we see stock price slowly but surely moving up a couple dollars each week. This will eventually lead to the MOASS imo, likely when gme hits 60-80 per share, or if Ryan cohen announces something. Worst case scenario March or June earnings could act as a catalyst.
Finally, someone talking about GME.
Good movie.
There’s nothing funnier than a well timed fart
I'm glad you think so. Right before GME spiked last week, I had explained over the weekend why GME was going up. He called me retarded and GME about doubled.

Fractional shares, the wonderful innovation that enables even broke retards to lose all their money.

Margin changes shouldn’t have a large effect. The sub was saying very bullish. It’s like I said bearish but is that 100k less bought shares? 500k? It’s not millions. 

It’s only going to matter for very concentrated and over-levered accounts. That’s typically retail. And I think retail has more direct longs than direct shorts, that’s all. It’s a special kind of stupid to go 100% short on this as an entire account.

You paid off your debt now start saving a bit for something e.g. a move, better job, reliable transportation etc. Get wheels in motion for progressed transition.

Thanks to the coverage by Cramer, a lot of new folks have arrived. The sub had increased user count by 200 K since Cramer’s GME coverage. Most of them are nice folks who are astonished at the risk levels of the average retard here, while, some are quite hostile. It’s an observation. Nothing more.

Sounds like a retard store owner not buying from wholesale then offloading bags to idiots for 20x instead losing money @ 8x
people trying to ratchet up retail volume / price probs
Try using a 10~15% trailstop instead... Moves up automatically but will let it slide down without getting whipped out unless it really starts to dive.

There are no silver bullets. You need to work on a lot of fronts to improve your life by the sounds of it and you’re playing GME like a lotto
> It’s called treating the gig income as if you didn’t have it (you know, what saving is) but sure I don’t know how to budget.

Sometimes that's not an option. If you can't save the money to move, you're probably paycheck to paycheck, which means the gig money could get eaten up by an emergency very easily. For some people simply 'treating it as if you don't have it' is literally not an option.

If you make more than 400k you will get a hike
I concur with this statement. Come Buyden! Let us buydem dips
I was cash gang between March and November lmao.
You're missing 1 of the key and very likely scenarios to happen, and that is GME filing for a secondary stock offering, clear up some debts on basically free capital, and get their balance sheet stabilised.

Now this is the scenario which benefits the shorts, RC because he owns a big stake in the business and is probably in it for the long-term, GME themselves, and completely fucks over retailers who have to baghold GME shares/longs.

I’m still trying to figure out how people on here are coming to what they think gme will squeeze to. Everyone is essentially just picking a random number or basing it off of Volkswagens infinity squeeze which is nowhere near the same situation gme is in

A couple of quotes regarding the Tesla short squeeze, which I think mirrors the GME squeeze more than VW does:


It’s not short-sellers covering their positions that’s been driving up Tesla’s stock price, according to Mark Spiegel, who runs a small hedge fund that’s short the company. But he does have other suspicions.


“Some entity — I don’t know who — was executing a strategy of buying massive quantities of out-of-the-money call options,” forcing call-option sellers to buy enough stock to hedge their exposure, Spiegel, founder of hedge fund firm Stanphyl Capital Partners, suggested by phone. “This thing just kind of spiraled its way up.”


Another driver has been widespread enthusiasm among individual investors buying Tesla shares this year through trading apps like Robinhood, according to Spiegel. “There was this whole gambling mentality that took place,” he says.

Yo, don't buy shares on leverage. I know it's insanely tempting for the upside but because they're on loaned money, the brokerage will still allow them to be sold short. Buy cash from here on out to help reduced the float.
I feel like you could create a mini series of well-known wsb autists
Biden announces he will sign executive orders in his first day of office, one of which to rejoin the Paris Climate Accord. Hopefully my ICLN shares will finally start printing.
man i only got 400 shares and I thought they were a lot...
Been there, never happens if you drink extra water
ICLN is having a pretty juicy dip currently, TAN too, most likely due to the recent run up due to the Blue sweep combined with the lackluster Biden response to clean energy (currently only focused on Covid, jobs, stimulus)

Decent entry for some leaps if you are a believer that this will the decade of EVs and climate action
This is the best way to play this. Any limit sell order under 100 needs to be cancelled.
Remember that we name the price. Not short sellers

Just looked into their financials, total collectibles are 11.2% of their net sales, and their definition of collectibles is pretty much everything minus hardware and software.

Significant but not enough to sustain the bleeding, and yes GME has been bleeding for years until the new console generation
Not sure I see it hitting 35 by then, that's a big move and its momentum has stalled a little bit recently. That said, I believe revenue will beat estimates for the past quarter. The outlook is very bright and the forward looking statements that ELY has provided so far post-merger feel very conservative. If that baseline is to be believed and the price action so far reflects that sentiment, a big revenue beat could push it to 35 by then.
here's the CEO talking about it at CES this year

Is Biden just gonna butt fuck us like the guy from pulp fiction in taxes when he takes office?
Forced to live? I moved to southern Missouri on a whim a few years ago from the west coast. It felt like being a big fish in a little pond. Everyone worked in retail or service and the only people making money in the town were time share sales people. 

You could easily get two or three jobs in the service industry and hustle your ass off to buy a house there, but most didn’t. I did and fixed it up to be a rental with plans for a lot more. I also immediately quit the jobs that secured the mortgage with the bank and started pursuing a dream of mine working from home. When money got tight, I would call up old bosses and take shifts. 

Finally I left. Went back to the west coast. Although it was really fun to make moves like that there, it was too difficult for me culturally. Too many undereducated people who had never seen the ocean or mountains. 

I sang the song and told them to follow me. I said there are jobs in tech and unlimited opportunities and it’s not like you need a passport to move states ...

No one did. Forced to live is bs victim mentality though. Get that shit outta here. Read a book, believe in yourself, go find the opportunities next to you and open your goddam mind!

Inorganic brand engagement: An autistic way

I see, people creating memes and post to encourage herd buying of GME shares. In fact, I joined in myself. 

I was thinking if people could boost brand engagements of a company in a similar way. The ticker is GOEV. What if 10-20% people on this sub decided to follow and engage with Canoo Inc’s social media accounts/posts e.g. following their page, liking and commenting their posts. This could provide a 5-10 fold increase in their engagement rate. Better brand engagement would mean better awareness of the company and their product. A retarded way to think would be less advertising expense which means more money for R&D. More💰 in R&D- better product- higher stock prices.

If this is not deleted my mods, go and follow Canoo Inc. in Instagram, Twitter, LinkedIn etc. Like and comment. GOEV to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Who was?  Current ratio is sitting at about 1.05 for the quarterly balance sheet ending on 10/31.  They can cover their debts.
I don't think you really understand exactly how budgeting works when things are that tight. If you can't save up to afford to move from your day job, your gig money will likely get spent on something more immediately needed.

Additionally humans literally need leisure and relaxation time. Nobody can work 24/7/365. Saying 'you should just not do anything you enjoy ever' is not an answer to financial issues. It leads to extreme mental problems.

Regardless we shouldn't have a slapfight like this in WSB. Now buy some fucking GME shares you retard.

WTF would be compare ourselves to some 40yr old or may or may not be able to throw$100k around in the market when we ourselves are mid-twenties?  Not realistic.

Right, so that’s why I thought given the improvements in the technology, it should at least be able to return to its ath and given that it’s the leader in the field and new contracts (and that this bull market is expected to continue through 2021). Maybe I’m wrong and should just buy GME like everyone else

Toy stores ≠ pop culture shit

This isn’t the same as me going to toy’s r us and buying a monster truck. There’s a reason why the stuff I just mentioned before has been getting moved like crazy (minus the exception of probably pop figures). Because they sell. Shit, as far as my knowledge of GameStop goes, they can’t even guarantee the preorders for Pokémon cards but are still required to oversell (although that might depend, on a store-to-store basis). The difference between little kids in toys stores and neck beards in GameStop is that neck beards actually have purchasing power to keep eating this shit up (whether it’s from Pokémon cards to even other video game merch, nerds love it)

With Roblox toys, people aren’t really buying it for the “toy” aspect.  We already know kids eat this robux shit up like it’s fucking nothing and they’re basically gambling to find a code for some rare cosmetic hat that’s highly valued in the Roblox economy (which is super inflated but with heavy demand, cosmetics being worth literally ~$1000 and moving like hotcakes too)

So although it might be true that toy stores are collapsing, it’s like comparing apples to oranges.

>extensive chain in an extremely dynamic sector with an extremely powerful brand. No other store

You forgot the /s, and no other stores exist because all other video games based stores are dead. Let's not kid ourselves this is all about the pivot hopium, they would've died eventually at their old projection. And now they're looking to compete with the likes of steam and amazon, good luck

I would expect a small rise in share price. If he does that and a possible tweet or sliver of good news/info then it’s definitely off to the 🌝! Let us pray over this long weekend. Also if it does happen remember to give small portion of tendies to a charity of your choosing!
I remember last weekend thread, there was about one GME comment every 30 min, and it was usually a bearish one too.

The difference between GME and BB is; GME gang is hoping for a short squeeze to take them to the moon, absolutely this can happen but it’s not a fundamental value it’s a temporary stock increase. BB gang sees huge future value in investing long term it’s not just about burning the shorts.

Dude, pick up a logic 101 book. And me not caring about your argument has jackshit to do with your color. Let's go through this step by step.

Op question: is it racist (in formal logic the assumption is always universal if not clarified, ie is it necessarily racist) to only be attracted to one race?

Your response: yes

My response: not necessarily

Your response :but it could be

So you are answering a universally minded question with only one side of a particular, after making a universal negative claim initially. Which makes your argument break down.

For a padawan autist like me this was a good read. Spank you very much.

Put an order in for 100 shares Tuesday open (from UK). If it goes up like we're expecting I honestly don't give a flying fuck if it dips straight after.
I also graduated with finance and economics degree and all my professors were advising me to diversify my portfolio and to split it 50/50 between blue chip stocks  and bonds, but instead I put everything into PLTR, BB and Apple calls and shares. However, none of my professors posts rocket emojis, so I think I am good. 
Plus traditional valuation methods do not work as well on growth companies. If you have conducted a DCF, Price Multiples, Gordon growth model or any other financial model for determining the fair price of TSLA 2 years ago, it will be a strong sell.

Look at Chewy's marpet cap, it's about 30x the one of GME. And they only sell stupid dog food a and cat toys and whatever. I think the 30x is only the "long" case, a potential squeeze of GME will probably go much higher, I think, even though noone knows it it will really squeeze or not. Still, that's the reason why I'm highly confident to YOLO almost all-in.

It’s also possible they spit roasted Warren Buffet through said glory holes
There are also NEGATIVE impacts to joining the Yield Enhancement Programs you discuss. Some of which could have significant impact to your bottom line (tax consequences by losing out on capital gains tax rates)
From Schwab:

Important considerations.
Market risk. There is the potential for downward pressure on the price of a loaned security if the security
is borrowed to facilitate a short sale.

Tax consequences. Instead of actual dividends, you may receive substitute payments in lieu of dividends (PILs). This may have tax consequences, because PILs may not be entitled to the same tax treatment as may have been applied to a dividend payment. Schwab is not required to compensate you for any differential tax treatment between dividends and PILs.

Loss of SIPC protection. Because borrowed securities may not be covered under the programs of the SIPC, loans are secured by collateral provided by Schwab. In the unlikely event of default by Schwab, you can draw upon this collateral, which may be your only restitution if Schwab fails to return the borrowed securities.

Loan term. Schwab may terminate
a loan at any time. You will be sent
a notification upon the termination of a loan.

Loss of voting rights. During the term of the loan, title to the securities is transferred to Schwab, providing Schwab with all incidents of ownership, including the right to vote on corporate actions and the right to transfer the loaned securities to others.

Edit: grammar
Why gme though? It's a broken company built on an outdated model, and should have died years ago. Why did so many people start buying these shit shares a year ago, and why are you still in it?
I think they will more likely focus on the quality of life than  games really.

The whole Merch, e-sports, fanstore  mixed with exclusive collector items something like those anime figure shop things.( or football Fanclub bars) It's own niche so to say. 
No esport fan myself, but there are plenty.  Now imagine you are a fan of e-sports and meet up with friends at the new gamestop bar  to watch some nerd  fight another nerd   on 6 different TVs simultaneously while ordering drings  and beeing able to shop for  Merch or collectables.

This atmosphere is still worth a lot of money for some people, instead of just sitting on your desk at home on the  desk watching the stream on a 27"incher.

But really I don't know what Cohens plan will be. He challenged amazon once and won, but who says amazon didn't learn from their mistakes to crush every competition?

But the Board looks strong-willed  to turn gme around and turn it into something new - so it's worth the yolo part of my portfolio.

It’s a lot more complicated than “sitting on the sidelines and crying foul”.

You sound like you’re young and in your 20’s, if so you get a pass for being delusional.

You have a very dismissive, self entitled and out of wack perspective on things. 

Time will either fix that for you, or you’ll become a sociopath by the time you’re 40+.

It’s great that you want to bust your butt off to move ahead but that janitor or cleaning lady you see is also busting their butts off. They just might not have the opportunity to be in your shoes...or maybe they did make poor life decisions.

But are we a society or not being able to redeem ourselves?

Or maybe they worked hard to even get those jobs?

Who are you to decide who is lazy and who isn’t?

Holder of LRCX (Lam Research) and some other semiconductor stocks in 2018, and they tanked when consumer confidence dropped.

Don't get emotionally attached to your trades. Have to be able to cut and go to cash, or switch to other names when that is what the market demands. You can sell and do something else and re-enter if the price dips to a lower point. Try to be disciplined about taking profit on short term call opiton plays. Doubling or tripling your money and selling is better than holding hoping it will go up 10x and then it pulling back so you are just up 20% or even lose money. 

Take emotion out of it. Take profit. Make gradual good gains on your portfolio. Play smart, don't be dogmatic. The goal is making money, not being right. 

This is a message to myself. Writing it out helps me think it through.
Sure, but the thing is that they could just stop building their Mars rocket and make bank on orbital launches. But as long as they have the money coming in and Elon keeps being Elon they won't because there's no need to.

Sometimes I make small market orders when I want to buy close to what a stock is currently trading. Ideally I would have a prescient limit order, but it’s tough to predict a peak or trough. Sometimes I’ve even set limit buy just a few cents under current price hoping to grab a wiggle, but the stock just kept shooting up and I missed out on a chance to make some money 🤷‍♂️

It’s a store with an extensive chain in an extremely dynamic sector with an extremely powerful brand. No other store can fill the niche in the gaming sector that they can if they pivot properly.
The real exit strategy is a triple digit price for a small portion of your stake that guarantees you won't lose money if the stock goes back to 16 (highest RC purchase price currently and default floor as long as he owns). Then you 💎🙌


For instance, I will sell 15% of my stake around 100-120 (market cap of ~6 billion) and hold the rest with a limit price at 500 (market cap ~23 billion, roughly half of what Chewy is now)
Particularly on an earnings play shares are a good move IMO... the price of options expiring  around earnings are higher as some volatility is expected, and with an earnings report that barely meets expectations or falls short suddenly those pricy calls drop to zero where the shares would only drop a bit.

Hi
It's possible Tim Apple and Peter Palantir hooked up in the dark room under a club or through a glory hole without knowing
There's a pretty good chance that this is a discovered story in the market, and already priced in. The shortage on microchips was on [nbc](https://www.nbcnews.com/business/autos/automakers-forced-cut-production-amid-global-shortage-computer-chips-n1254311), [npr's marketplace](https://www.marketplace.org/2021/01/11/ford-latest-automaker-cut-production-microchip-shortage/), and a slew of other business related news outlets.
rush !
ICLN:

“Given the current short-term trend, the fund is expected to rise 57.75% during the next 3 months and, with a 90% probability hold a price between $44.58 and $54.64 at the end of this 3-month period.”
Veterans of the Tesla, Tilray and Beyond Meat squeezes know this is the truth. The difference here is the short % is much higher. The volatility (up and down) should also be higher on GME going forward. This means the tendies will be fatter once were done.

👑Status. Love to see it
So at 19 I finally figured out why people look at me wierd. Apparently I AM cross eyed, in my LEFT eye (the eye everyone looks at when talking to you) and I didn't realize until last week because NOBODY had the balls to tell me "hey, your eye is fucked up". I'm probably going to need another surgery. Fucking hell man. It all makes sense though. When I talk to someone they don't even listen to anything I say. They just look at me like confused and don't say anything. FUCK MY LIFE.
Charts are crystal clear, all the info you need is in the charts.

Charts are intended for traders and not for karma commenters, here's and example of real traders comments on the same charts in private real traders Reddit community. Be wise, stop spoiling and follow charts, make some money.

"Gu, EU and nj, are right on their support levels. EU forming falling wedge on 4h and right at 50D ma. Also DXY is right at sell zone. Look out for China's gdp numbers and how they will impact market mood, remember monday US market closed. I think we might get rebound in equities this week so risk might be on."

Learn to trade, be humble.
I use fidelity and shares bought in cash are converted to margin just because I’m in so many positions. However, trimming down other positions should let you retain a cash position without them journaling margin.

It’s a beautiful thing<3 Thank you retards!
Anyone but the one you're going to buy.
Buy GME, BB, PLTR, lCLN
Truth
How is this not the top comment yet? Don't cheap out and send em some huge bad dragon ones lol.
Probably a good chance the stock will continue to be shorted and have the price go down due to that all week. And then WSB pressure to buy the dips, and push it back up.

One thing I’ve noticed is a stock will jump, up or down, then hit a point of resistance where it will bounce in the other direction for a little, and then continue the earlier momentum. So, watching like a 🦅 could bite you in the 🍑 . Personally, not telling you what to do, I usually set a limit buy at a low price where I would be happy to own and feel like I was getting a “deal,” and then set another portion of funds to buy manually if I think I see the end of a second dip. No surefire formula for something so emotional though!
who here likes rock? shout out to zeplin and floyd (but only the good floyd)
I’ll buy you a ps5 if that happens
My understanding is Palantir doesn't collect the data. It helps organizing it, and making sure only parties that are allowed access to certain parts of the data actually have access. It also helps anonymizing the data. I think privacy rules are better upheld with Palantir than with no Palantir.
Lol you're the only one bringing race into this and not addressing any points
I bought some monthlies as a side-play at $16.70 for a quick ride back to $17.50-ish, but I assume it'll just ping around $16-$18 until big news breaks. A contract would be great but there's also a lingering fear of the test clients reporting less than expected efficiency. Vol is great for premium for now
this is inspiring! 🚀🚀🚀
Thanks frends. Tx sucks and insurance won’t cover it. I’m a speech therapist( don’t make near what you would think, wife is a school counselor) we managed to get pregnant finally after two years but lost the baby at week ten. IVF is our last resort so even 14 shares would start to make a dent. Good luck

The giant amount of shorts leads to most likely a short squeeze after the jump last week.

Ryan Cohen and a few others from Chewy literally took over the board. They plan on giving them a better digital presence.

Finally, they're undervalued. Multiple DD have pointed out that their p/e is less than 1x or something.

Why don't you hunt down some of the dozens of Gamestop DD posts and maybe you'll see why most of the sub has money in it.
Am I to late for the Vale calls 🤔 I got s spare $10,000. What should I do with it on Vale or Mt options
Bb fomo is real but as a trader you should know that there's always another trade out there with lots of tendies. Don't all in and hold for 6 months then sell before the mooning.

Either you trade it or you put at most 20% of your portfolio into it.

Lots of tendies in the market.

Civil rights are great and all but this is getting out of hand
Haha, right on point. I got the idea for this tool after watching their "the great outdoors" livestream in May. I've made a video (search for joella ai on YouTube) about the methodology. At the beginning of the video I am talking about the Dumb Money backstory.
Does not wait for GME as well. All funds have been expended.
he has done MANY interviews arguing this.  he breaks it down into bits and atoms.  says US has been innovating in bits (and the business of bits like internet, mobile access) but atoms (energy, healthcare, manufacturing, infrastructure) has been neutered by regulation.  i think for
him it boils down to a similar thesis for palantir.  ai at the government level will exist, if US and allies (as he says) bring their A game then they will continue to lead the developed world but if they are hobbled by regulation, by having subpar engineers working the problem because large silicon valley companies have ethical reservations, and therefore put up a soft effort then China will rise to lead.  similarly if the US doesnt unlock the full potential of innovation in the “atom” sector by allowing innovators to work less constrained then our economy will not continue to have any relevance outside of a software defined service based economy.  innovation will be left on the table and has been since the 70s

more or less something like that... like i said check youtube
What trading platforms do you autists use?
Also, great write up! Long PLTR myself and planning on tripling my shares in it over the coming months 🚀🚀🚀

Oh yah for sure! PC’s seem like the way for GameStop to do something Big. As far as I know the PC retail market is pretty fragmented. Nobody seems to really do it well at the retail level.

Have a look at [European Metals](https://www.europeanmet.com/) (ERPNF on Nasdaq International or EMHLF on standard OTC markets). They operate the largest lithium source in Europe, and are centrally located around major companies, such as VW, Tesla, BASF, Porche, and a lot more. They will most likely become the primary supplier for all of Europe, which has a significantly larger EV market than the United States.
It’s an early stage play, so options are not available, but shares trade around $1.

Hope you hit your next trade big!
It ends at some point
This is so random but it confirms my confirmation bias so you’ll get a 🚀

Portfolio throwing 🅱️lood gang in my face this weekend
Everyone should just look at OSTK for classic example of what happens in these situations. Company heavily, if not illegally shorted. The stock goes 3$ to 100+ with 30% dips along the way. The dips are just consolidation of the puts/calls/weak hands/accumulators moving money. Someone can overlay a price chart for a better reference to future possibilities.
Source?
Prison street cred check
I dont think it is bullish or bearish. But retail shorts are subject to the same rules. Probably wont see many small fish shorting GME now, or they will get rekt

I dunno, but i think it was not random that once the price hit 42 (around Melvins original short position) that it got beat down from there. I think if it goes above 42 organically, melvin will close out shortly after that

Typically when the Dems are in control, the news story changes and what was once the topic of conversation is no more. Dems tend to focus on social issues way more than republicans whom try to down-play issues. This changes the discourse and topics of conversations in the news, which has a huge affect on share price.

I think you’ll be fine though, Market expects more stimulus from the Dems which is more music to this game of musical chairs.
Because there's a pretty fair chance that they're going to get prison raped by it.

Buy GME or ban
Money volatility is at an all-time low if money isn’t moving around inflation doesn’t happen
I know. It's one of the ironic parts of it. So when read the paper the conclusion is essentially that metacognition fails; the main "test" for it was giving 1st year students with just a little knowledge a survey which to measure their confidence in their knowledge of the subject and the results of their testing. What was fascinating (and the part that is often missed) is that those who assumed they knew *less* did better on the tests than those who assumed they knew *more* which is important *because* the metacognition failure *goes both ways*.

Most people focus on the overconfidence element however it actually goes the other way too; the more experienced and wizened you are to a subject *the more you realize how big it is* and the *less confident you tend to be in your abilities* until some point. It's an error in ability to measure oneself. 

I personally think the second result is more important than the first one. This is actually what leads a lot of people to bad trading decisions, or what we call, "Weak Hands", where people make good trades and then doubt themselves and their own knowledge and expertise and ability and exit early.
You either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become a villain
 That would imply ppl want to actually cover their margin. Pending a large crash, no.
Can you explain what’s going on with GME?
A likely happy bear story if ive ever heard one
You actually think the squeeze hasn’t started yet??  Wow wtf
If you read it, you'd know it wasn't. 

People think that anything that isn't going "GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀" is a 🌈🐻 post, so I thought I'd put that in there.
Haha. I maybe in a very similar boat.

I feel sorry for the bulls in here. They know what’s coming next week it’s not a secret. Any monkey can pull up an hourly chart and see the direction we’re heading.

Long story short, my wife and I are struggling to have a child. Trying to gamble a little to make the staggering 25,000 it cost in Texas for IVF treatment.
Why
Extremely.  Especially when white people do it.

Revolutionary. As a console background player, PC building is kind of daunting for me. Too much geeky tech specs for most people. This could open the floodgates for the wider market.
It do be nice outside. Now if ICLN doesn’t moon it isn’t gonna be nice forever so yes, enjoy the outside as much as you can while you can.
I have 15 that I’m taking to my grave, and passing on to my children!
One movie won’t fix what’s broken but it can definitely open your eyes and teach you a thing or two if you’re keeping an open mind.

How you’re talking to all of us is very close-minded, which is a scary place for the human body and kind to stay. Chemical production in your brain is literally linked to your actions so maybe being here and  acting as you are is feeding into your depression.

If you want to change your feelings you have to change your thoughts. 

It’s tragically simple and, like I said before, we are being curated by billionaires daily. They want you to feel like this because ultimately they want less of us around. 

The only way I think you can begin to feel better is to unplug and change your everyday actions right now.
here i was thinking you were looking for a rational bear perspective and this is your response to me lol

why did i even bother putting effort replying to your post? Keep being full of confirmation bias i guess while longtime bulls like DOMO capital have already sold out their GME shares at $40
I like your site, nice and clean. Sounds like youre doing social arb. Check out chris camillo. hes the godfather of social arb.
i'm fucking broke maaannnn.. ^^^^justkidding
i only buy shares
Idk I think GME has wild momentum and is going to double again this week

Dude, experience life some more kid, let it harden you up. Because right now you are an extreme pussy! The man was offering to potentially help you find some work, I assume he was hoping maybe you would have some type of appreciation or politely ask for further details. However you remarked like a pussy, and who wants to help someone like that.  It doesn’t matter that you are blabbering about wanting to die, I don’t want to give you my pity, the world doesn’t owe you shit my boy, a little bit of effort and action is required on your side...

In a game of billions isn't that 800 dollars?
Agreed, just more losses. When do they cut their losses I wonder. They may feel the need to flex, as if retail prevails it sets a dangerous precedent for them.
We need to brigade r/dividends and get them to buy more shares.  GME yield is like 4%!!!!

Good question, replying to follow any reasonable explanation.

Probably some sell some don't. Not gonna rely on calling the top or being on the markets ready to trade during the MOASS
If you going out with those futures, then do Jan. ‘22. This is at least doubling from close Friday by EOY if not sooner. The floor will continually increase. It’s at about 8-9 now.

I don't actually know. I expect them to follow this rule. I can't actually say that it will benefit us though. They might put a 100k sell wall on an uptick basically killing the market for some time. But don't take the insane ramblings of a retard as sound investment advice.

I like that we have an obese, literal diaper wearing president on a cocktail of not so properly prescribed pills, which literally, visibly, turn him into a pants-shitting and ranting buffoon, who eats McDonalds for the majority of his meals, with the only exercise he does being swinging a golf club or walking to and from his golf cart, but somehow he’s seen as virile and healthy. 

Then you have an incoming president who eats a proper diet, works out regularly, and who only takes properly prescribed medications and vitamins, but he’s the one who is seen as “going to die any minute”.
2013/2015
why this trust? the dems will fuck you over too.
Oh i bought them on Friday so it wasn't based on your advice, just some nice confirmation bias to help me keep them!
Let me ask; what in hell makes him think we've been in a slump of innovation since the '70's I wonder?

Your Europoor DD is of significantly higher quality than most, aside from missing RC going to jail (or at least spending a lot on lawyers) if he bails as an insider in a “surprise” move on your first scenario.

In full seriousness, this is well written and well done.

Thank you for sharing it.
Not to be a retarded bitch but, the profits and business model do not really support 400 dollars price on this, do they? Seems like 25 dollar stock to me.
Try going out sometimes. Even just alone for a walk.
[deleted]
It's not about "thinking" or "being smart."

All the DD is about convincing others to buy, so you can sell yours at a higher price. GME is a game of diamond hands, but the first group of people to sell before the inevitable crash wins it.

People putting their life savings in are eating the bait.
FYI, I have paper hands and I will be selling out WSB for $420.69/share.  My sell order is in, if you are waiting for a higher price, GL.
Some people are into that, I won’t judge 🤷‍♂️
Doesnt even look like the same girl in both pics tbh

Why dont you go out and find an apprenticeship or learn a trade? Do you realize how many people in data science never went to college and pull in bags just because they read a few books?
Just one question before we rocket, does this also mean both Cohen and Karp are also granted to sell more than the said amount before 30 days instead?

Snowing pretty hard here, I took my puppy out and just sat under a pine for about 30 minutes. Just sitting, breathing, watching the large flakes fall to the ground. I really collected myself. Now I can confidently say GME 90 EOW let’s go😤🚀
Think we are before the dip, tuesday we will see very little with maybe a bump or two up because of 201.  If any announcement comes out it gaps up.  However on wed/thursday we will see more pressure for the drop again.  Friday will be interesting because of reporting, i suspect a dip wed/thur the true test of diamond hands.  Most likely the following week the rocket begins, i dont know where the most open short dates are and how much they want to bleed trying to short again.
yeah the delivery guy is going to deliver the vaccine in the ass tho.
Yeah...oops 😅🚀🚀🚀🚀
I think Mr beast is in here and holding a massive position in GME. Dude bought literally everything from a GameStop and posted the video 2 days ago.
im a gamer, i buy my hardware on amazon/newegg or german equivalents and i buy games on steam (or get them for free on epic games because of stupid softbank money). all my friends do the same.
And not one of these new retards putting in their life savings ask themselves that? Wtf. Or the people writing DD?

Your never going to make it, instead of saying yeah that would be great hit me up man and let's see what happens! You ignore it turn it into something negative how everyone is out to get you. No one is out to get you. You are out to get yourself your to fucking stupid and lazy to follow threw with things what do you expect people to just show up at your doorstep and say hey man wanna come work with us I'll give you $100,000 a year!!! You would slam the door in their face because you don't want to succeed . Get your shit together and go look in the mirror and say this is why I'm a fucking failure because I chose to be because I shit on every opportunity I've ever been handed and now people don't give a shit.

When you say 20-25% away, are you referring to the CC price compared to his strike price, market price, or break even price?

Wouldn’t it be to sell premium that is at least the cost of the margin fee (2.5%)?
Cuz they have lots of technology back then, they can afford only 1 parent to work. Now we didn’t have technology so 2 parents are necessary to work and we also have a bad economy

The ones who gained power were fucking hardcore to maintain it. Think that North Korean chick level of hardcore. Those sugar mommas would be scary
depends on when you bought.  

I was in when it was a SPAC at $11, so those are gucci.  

I bought warrants at $4.25 last week before it mooned on the Apple rumors; those maybe in jeopardy if it follows it's pattern of bleeding until random hype/positive news comes out.
You can't add a disclaimer "don't gamble with money your can't afford to lose" under every post. If your life depends on the performance of a meme stock, you are at the end of a long list of bad decisions.

Unfortunately "finding someone ugly" is sometimes equivalent to hating them. Ever hear about those kids who would get bullied for their looks?
I heard RH automatically buys on margin. Is this accurate? Are all accounts auto-margin accounts unless you email them asking to not be on margin?
If the markets didn’t dip due to a mutant strain of covid or all the other shit that has happened, what makes you think MM will give a shit about protestors?
Honestly even I feel like Chinese stocks should be banned from this sub. Very hard to differentiate a normal person from a ccp shill these days. That being said I do  have some money in NIO...
Your second clause is correct. It is a downside to the strategy, it depends on how aggressive or conservative you are with your stop loss. If it’s within the normal price movement or just experiencing wild swings, you capture more gains (in the immediate term) but risk exiting when you don’t want to. If it’s set very low, you stay in during wild volatility but risk losing more than you otherwise would if it truly tumbles. It’s not perfect, it’s risk mitigation.

This is going to happen to you regardless of what brokerage you use while you have a balance less than 25k. It is a federal regulation.

That's a huge amount of shares lol
You’re really running a tight operation over there, huh?
They’re 11% precisely because it doubled, it’s passively managed and rebalanced twice a year

So Robinhood just restricted me because of “pattern day trading” any suggestions on another broker mainly for options trading
I may get back on twitter just to tell him that hes a limp dick. Hit that stupid sound button a few more times, what a stupid fuckn gimmick. Anyone that would put that as part of their show is full blown water head.
I connected the dots and gave a reason I'm investing based on the sources I listed as best I could. If you don't see the connection or think I'm retarded, don't invest.
Thats why i haven’t bought in and still debating

There should be one more bearish bullet. Gamestop has a notorious reputation in the gaming community. And it'll be hard to shake that off.
Took me a bit to wrap my head around it, but yeah it does seem counter intuitive to do that
why is there the expectation to reach $50?

I'm like Cypher, but with taxes, "blonde, redhead, brunette".
Well that’s not right. But possibly neither are the other sites. I believe number of shares shorted info is only released monthly. Like Yahoo says it’s 260% based on 12/31/2020 short number.
Best to treat anything here as food for thought, not straight recommendations unless your gambling is on taking the advice itself which could be fun in its own right.
Is it racist to only be attracted to one race ?
life can be great brotha, even if its dark as hell now. Hold on and look forward to brighter futures. and if your not a religious man maybe head on down to your local Church, where you can find some love and joy.

I remember being down -25% when I bought at 170 shares at $18, but  💎 💎 💎 💎 💎 hands pay off highest was up 150%, 109% today.
I bought for $10. Still a great price while it’s under $30 a share.
Options have nothing to do with the share price.
Do you do any penny stocks? Doubled my account with them in 5 weeks but lost 15% with them then. Too scared to go back in

Oh I meant for most of us who have already bought in before the top. Yeah obviously others coming in at a later PT will hold major bags true.

bruh fuck you for jinxing it. This is what we deserve for WSB not getting the "stonks go up" article out first.
I'm the FD options shopkeep on the first level. Most people restart with fresh new game gold until one of the FDs hits but then restart after level two, back to buying from me.
Yeah then if it moons he misses all the gains... been there and done that dont sell cc‘s under 20-25% away

Ban, stop posting this shit on every subreddit
At the end of the day the ones who are thriving here most likely suffered at one point or another due to the advice of an Internet stranger.

You either grow and learn from an experience like that, or you let it break you down.  

Either way it is dependent on that person and the many external factors in their own life, nobody here has an accountability or credibility behind anything they post & should be treated as such.
Lol youre a moron dude. I literally have known 0 people before an interview in my entire career. But keep crying like a fucking coward.

IV crush and 2022 is sufficiently long out for the board to refocus on eCommerce and reduce costs. GME had a revenue of about 6,5 billion in 2019 with a market cap of about ~2billion at this moment. If they manage to reduce costs I can see them being profitable again soon. I'm almost certain your puts will expire worthless

There are a million ways for a retard to ruin their lives. It’s not your fault. It’s not your fault. It’s not your fault.
Palantir’s software was missused and abused by the current administration in regards to the ICE program Palantir facilitates.  The tech is fine.  All these reports coming out about a call to ditch Tiberius (palantir covid project) I am sure at the heart of it will
be found to be a similar situation.  a tool is only as useful as the person who wields it.

Have you listened to Alex Karp talk about trump?  dude hates him.  Thiel only liked trump because of the promise of unbuckling restrictions on innovation.  he believes the US has been in a slump of innovation outside of software since the 70s.  I think an infrastructure plan from any party will be enough to
realign him to current admin regardless of party.
DFV?
Since the market is closed on monday in the US , but Open in Europe - does it make sense to buy there if possible?

It's going up so w/e lol
Idk man I can’t give u a number, but IMO if Cohen can pull this off, GameStop is definitely going to be worth more than Chewy, since the gaming market is way bigger than pet food market. It belongs more to tech sector than e commerce if Ryan Cohen wants to enter PC customization market. Who knows if they’re gonna be like Razor and even build their own branded PC in the future? These are all wild talks as RC hasn’t announced anything yet. I just think there are a lot to be done in this market than pet market, and yet Chewy is still worth $40B.

> I’ve gone to employees and tried to offer them promotions or money and I can’t tell you how many times they have been like “uhh so what would I have to do?” Then they tell me they will think about it and never get back to me. It’s like “dude you told me you wanted more money, but you refuse to take on more responsibility?”

I'm not sure what industry you're in, but it can absolutely be worth it to increase the pay of technical workers for retention purposes even if they don't want to move to something managerial. Not everyone is capable of being a leader and you can't have an organization of only leaders. Specialists are extremely valuable in some fields.
Well... WSB was hammering down that you need stocks because of volatility. Updated my post so people will remember not to make this mistake.
Yeah. That is exactly what happens. And with a company as small as GME, was $1.6b cap, for big boys they just short it another billion. 

BUT they do have to pay borrowing fees, similar to how we have to pay premium on call options, making their bet inefficient. And there is a limit to how much they can short. At this point there isn’t much left to borrow and sell. 

Buying stock in cash accounts is our best weapon. Buy, don’t ever sell it, wait them out, no borrowing fees or premiums. They will exit as their positions get worse and more expensive over time.

AND the fact is, GME is not going bankrupt, it’s probably worth close to $60/share on fundamentals alone based off sales.

To my understanding Ryan Cohen can no longer just sell all his shares. Also highly doubt he would, man has conviction he would retire already if he didn't give a shit I think this is about ego and showing to the world and himself he's able to not only stop a ship from sinking but turn that shit into a fucking rocket.

VALE has a massive float at 3.95 billion shares, compared to MT at 771 million. VALE is also notorious for killing its employees. MT also trades lower compared to book value.

I need to see the Q4 earnings, and a mission statement from RC and the boys once the other board members retire.
RC couldn't dump at this point even if he wanted to. His percentage of ownership is too high and he's now on the board. That sort of move is regulated by the SEC and requires sufficient warning to shareholders.
While you bears are waiting for a pull back, bulls are 2xing their money on the regular. Say we have a 33% pull back. Big deal if your up 400-500%. If it pulls back in this day and time “retail traders” will only double down.

Because robinhood doesn’t offer cash accounts, so any share that they sell can immediately be put on the market to be shorted. Cash accounts negate this ability.
Search volume is already a factor in the event (keyword) ranking. That ranking is also influenced by ...

Yea saw he sold the 1/15 calls which of course made sense. But is he still holding his other positions is the question

If you still FOMO and buy in at the peak, where ever it may be (I doubt we have seen it) you only fall. Even if it wasnt a short. Some of those FOMOers are going to be newer users that hear about WSB through the media hype. 

More and more retail users will pile on to it as the squeeze happens. Some will get caught holding the bag. Its just the way the market works. Some one always has to be holding the bag.

But yes, I do agree. Its a great time to profit off of short firms.

This is a perfect example of the mantra I consistently follow after years in the market.

“You only lose money if you sell.”

This doesn’t count for options obviously. But if you start a position and you’re down 20%. Average down.

Stock drops another 10%. Average down.

Yes and Melvin has history of cutting their loses with shorts. They did lose approximately $25 million when they shorted Nintendo. So it’s not impossible to bleed them dry as they have to worry about current and future investors.
0.13 here with you (may make it up to 1 on Tuesday but sticking with "never invest what you wouldn't want to lose" mantra).  Gotta start somewhere. 

I'm not a big boy but I'm learning a lot from all the DD on this!  The laughs I got from all the chatter on Wed was brilliant.  😁

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Based on your responses, it seems like you’re just looking for any reason to hate yourself or feel sorry for yourself. Idk your life or what you’re going through, but I can guarantee you a lot of us have been there. I’ve felt like a failure for a good chunk of my life and have struggled with depression too. 2020 cut me even deeper, as I lost a good chunk of money from trying to learn to trade. The greatest bull run ever and I was losing money. 

It wasn’t till November that I switched to theta gang strategies and started making consistent gains. I started with only $3000 in that account. Granted, I did have much more money that I deposited later, but you can set goals with $3k. Not saying to switch to theta gang. You do what works for you.

You don’t have $3k. I get it. I’ve been there too. They should be sending stimulus checks, save that for the market when it comes. You don’t have a job, no one seems to want to hire you. Go get a gig job. Hell I know some people doing doordash make $1k a week hustling. It’s not much money but it’s not bad for a gig where you get to be your own boss. 

Bottom line is I know a lot of us have been there. I struggle with that feeling of failure every day. You need to pull yourself out of it and cut that shit out. Go take a walk, get some fresh air, and enjoy life one minute at a time.

Microsoft, who GME has partnered with, is literally blurring the line between console and pc gaming.

That is not to say physical stores are doomed, but they need to pivot heavily.

128% percent of float still shorted. The squeeze has not happened yet
I have a covered call for GME queued up good for 60 days to sell a 2/5 40$ call for $50. I don't watch the market all hours it's open so this is just my safety net if I dont see the squeeze happen. I got in @ 17.50 so this is more than enough profit if it stop. Hopefully I can see it happen and adjust accordingly.
Yes
Why isn't there a category for most awards given to posts about GME going to the fucking moon?
Big oversight there.
That what beautifully put
It's not as evil as FANG. FANG stores, analyze and sell our data but act as clean companies. PLTR just analyzises the data, it doesn't collect it.
Watch a documentary called Happy. 

I’m telling you, I’m doing really well for myself and I’m still struggling with mental health issues: severe anxiety, clinical depression and rage. I’ve been locked up, I’ve been broke with no job and I’ve been more than ok financially for like 8 years. It’s only been recently that I’ve become truly happy, and by recently I mean like within the last year.

There’s more to life than money even though society tells us the opposite every minute they can. Maybe you need to unplug for a while. It’s never healthy to be battling an ever-changing market manipulated status quo because it’s set to have you constantly reaching something that’s always out of grasp.
Once again blaming other people for your own actions. If that's the case then go get professional help instead of complaining on the internet and trying to get some internet points.

Wtf is a scale, u don't need that mumbo jumbo, give me the moon
True. Similar but no the same. I was around and old enough to know and remember. But these are different times. The rate that the fed prints money is driving up stock prices naturally. You can’t print trillions of dollars out of thin air and expect the price of anything to stay stagnant. Stock prices go up just like milk and eggs. IMO the only bubble here is the US dollar
I had a stop loss set at $32, and this is exactly why I removed it.

I know it's a safe play in the long run, but good lord is it gonna be a bumpy fucking ride on the way.
I thought the plan was to release the reserve right away so if it's not there than the plan is moot. 

You may be right about the speech but if I were to guess it more has to do with 15 dollar an hour minimum wage and the checks being 1400 when some thought they maybe 2000. Just my opinion though

A wake up call is needed for the GME gang. This could be a long drawn out battle between us and shorters. In that case good news and a road map for the change at GameStop will slowly bleed the shorters out. It will also make other people think twice about shorting it in the near future. This will lead to a steady rise in share price!
Cheers to a much better future fam!

Thank you for your contribution. I will add this in the bull case shortly.
The number of promotable positions necks down severely as you climb and there's a pretty low ceiling on practically attainable positions. Even if they 'cared more' there's a pretty solid ceiling staying in that line of work.

What's more, a lot of places do promotions in a variety of dumb ways, and after you do a year or two of your best and they tell you to get fucked you lose any motivation.

Not sure. But as far as I know the rule was in effect for the last hour of trading Friday and we still saw a 7% dip during that time. My guess is that they were preparing to drop the price as low as possible to save options and we will see rise on Tuesday. But it's just my guess.

Yeah dude if you've got $60k that you can afford to lose you're extremely well off. I make a very good salary and I can't afford to toss $60k at anything short of a house.

I mean, if I had $60k.
ge s fycked
This is the way
(Not currently holding a position) This has nothing to do with fundamentals anymore. They had their quarterly earnings which were great and allowed the stock to hold when it needed. Its all about screwing over the short sellers at this point. They can only hold out so long before they have to cover and once they do itll push the price up. The questions are 

A) how long can they hold out 
B) will people take profit before that happens causing the price to go down (effectively creating a better opening for them to cover) 

Theoretically though the shorts will all have to take a loss because levels likely wont return below where they shorted
Strange DD but think OP said get calls on FB TSLA and NIO?? Sounds good to me. Im in!

Just because they have the cash to cover doesn't mean they're ok with it, however. You are right about one thing, though; that they will have to capitulate sooner or later, and every day that stock price goes up, they will feel the temp in the room rising.

why would you FOMO like this
You could the lives of a small city with a billion dollars. The myth of socialism and communism is that the wealth of the very rich would be enough to cover the lifestyles of an entire country. 

I did the math one day and in my country you could confiscate the wealth of anyone considered wealthy and (assuming you could find someone willing to buy the assets) get enough money to run the govt for 3 years or do 1 years worth of GND proposals. In other words leftists massively overestimate the wealth of the rich and underestimate the cost to run a govt.

What is BB?
I hope y’all get mighty gains, but just an FYI the stock already 10x’d. If it goes to 100 which a lot are holding for then you are looking at a 2500% gain in a year-ish time.
I think comparing this with the VW squeeze may be a little misguided.

See the thing is this time, although we are competing which each other yes for who gets to suck the most blood, the main source of tendies this time is from a completely extraneous source. Thats whats so beautiful about. Sure one of us could make considerable less than another based on timing, but we could all stand to benefit greatly in net at the expense of the shorts.
Sell, and buy puts on both.

Thanks for the info and to everyone who posts good DD to this forum!
Same to you
Aren't we unlikely to see a dip on Tuesday because of the up-tick rule implemented?
usually don’t post much on here, but yes. Fuck boomer cramer
Yes but obv short contracts that these big boys write aren't the same ones we have with our brokers. There's usually a lot fluidity and negotiation as the current status changes. Because we're tiny retail investors, our brokers can shit on us with no reprecussions. Same isn't true with big hedges that can hold their own on legal disputes and simply just withhold margin like every asshole did in 2008. When the position is big enough, you can't bully as easily as a broker, but there is some reasonable limit at which the broker can begin to ask questions.

I've never heard a retard use terminology like "net bearish". 

Also, it's suspicious that he's encouraging autists to "get paid to loan out your shares" by purchasing with margin. This would give more time and resources to the shorts.

Honest opinion: What about doing and internship? Common way to get to know people and show what you can do. Almost anyone has to grind for years and prove themselves to get to 100k+ Just work, learn and most importantly, see and make use of opportunities if they present themselves. Invest as you go along, don't gamble
Why would you go into municipal bonds for only a 4.5% return? You could invest in a shit ton of other products with less risk and better returns.

I think you should weigh the anomalies by search volume as well, a 2% drop on a highly trafficked keyword should have a much higher signal than a 90% drop on a keyword that gets 1000 queries per week.

**CHALLENGE UPDATE:**

Well, I really picked a dogshit stock, and now I'm stuck bagholding 100 shares of it...

QS has tanked hard consistently and is now down a whopping 21% from my entry point. Still, I'm going to follow my general rule and not close this position for a loss. I need to find the breakeven covered call. Which means: the intersection point where premium gained from the CC reduces my cost basis to match the strike price of the same CC. At the moment that appears to be almost exactly ATM.

**Option: QS 54c 1/29 = $5.50 premium**

**Cost basis: $65 (assignment) - $5.50 (CSP premium) - $5.50 (CC premium) = $54**

Again, this is the power of Theta Gang on high IV stocks, and why it will always outperform "buy and hold." Even with the stock being down 20%, I can still break even at the current price, and all I will have lost is time. Anyone who simply bought shares at the same exact time I entered my CSP would now be down 20% with little hope of recovery. I will of course have to reevaluate the prices Tuesday morning.

**LESSON LEARNED:** Don't be greedy. I was too enticed by the extremely high premium on QS. If I would have continued the more conservative PLTR play from last week, I'd be sitting pretty right now. Hopefully I can still recover and get this challenge back on track next week.
this seriously needs to be pinned here for the next 48 hours
yes pls buy more so i can get more tendies
Combined - probably yes, but I don't understand how any of them separately could have any meaningful influence with their stakes.

I make 100k without knowing anyone, and while still in school...but okay. Get into anything with software, get good, get your foot in the door at 1 company making 60k, then either really do well and step up twice to 100k, or become a contractor and make 100k. My company pays me as a fullyime employee with full benefits while i could be let go once the client no longer needs us, its a good setup.

If you make $10 an hour, the thought of being a millionaire and being able to get $20K a year on interest from a 30 year Treasury sounds like heaven.  

If you make $200K a year, are in your prime earning years, hitting 7 figures is just a number.

You’re delusional 🤢
Can I ask, what you do? I have a bachelors and I can apply myself to a wide variety of tasks, and I’m starting to break out from retail limbo, but I always welcome tips for how to find the next step.

I was in retail for 5 years after college (graphic design internship ended and they were like “Project complete, thanks for the help but we don’t need to take you on permanently now,” got a job at Apple Genius Bar because I’m also pretty good at tech), but they do a lot to say there’s limited availability and a lot of competition for promotions. Last two years have been an amazing exploration, I started working as a contractor doing social media and community management, got up to like $3.5k/month, but 2020 messed me up. Broke my arm in January which hampered my ability to film and demonstrate products, social media position decided they wanted someone in Germany (might’ve been other politics), and another client took advantage of the shutdown to say they didn’t have work for me (they were being paper handed about how an online presence could continue getting their cheap items sold during the start of the pandemic).

TLDR: I started freelance consulting and investing, but 2020 cost me half my income for each month (sometimes even lower). Working from home has been my jam for 2 years, wondering what’s next.
That's beside the point. But since JFK and the Cuban guys there haven't been that many gun-crazed pseudo-revolutionary lunatics aiming at the president.

Fixed is way more predictable and recommended if you dont trade high volumes. I had been using fixed for the last 2 years before trying out Tiered recently... and switched back immediately

Fixed is available in Canada for options and might seem more attractive at first look than Tiered, but there's is one small detail that many people overlook: by using Tiered you'll have to cover the Exchange-related fees by yourself (while they are covered by ibkr when using Fixed)

If you ain't familiar with Exchange related fees and such, just stick with Fixed pricing when trading options!

My experience with Tiered + Options: I  remember buying  2 SPY straddles (4 options in total) and not caring about which Exchange i was using and it ended up costing me 15$ in comissions/fees to buy. When i sold them, it went on another exchange and I paid 1.50$ in comissions/fees... yeah, for this reason Tiered can lead to cery inconsistent pricings if you dont know what you are doing

As for the Fx fees : I never really gave it much attention but I'd say it's pretty much always around 2-3$ and i convert around 2 to 10k at the time. The exchange rate you get is the actual Fx market rate, not a fake rate meant to rip you off. 

Edit: It starts at 2$ + 0.002 * trade Fair Value

As a Canadian myself, i feel you. I need to do USD/CAD conversions on a weekly basis and finally having a broker offering an honest rate is a hame changer you'll see 

Anyway, I strongly suggest you [look up the pricing chart it](https://www.interactivebrokers.com/en/index.php?f=1590&p=stocks) for yourself as your needs might not be the same as I.

Keep in mind you can switch between both pricing structures at any time and at no fees!
Imagine risking your health to see a washed up performer mumble some shit you can't even understand

It will be interesting to see if MSFT and Sony release any sales data that would indicate which console versions are selling best. My hunch is digital-only will win out over a 5-7 year selling cycle, but it is just a guess.

When I scooped up my PS4, I also bought a handful of physical games to go with it. But since that time I have only purchased via download and I am having trouble seeing why I would ever go back to physical discs.

I will agree the some percentage of consumers will prefer physical disc, but is it enough? 

I think about the computer industry as well. My old gaming desktop had a disc drive, but neither of my past two laptops did, and I have never once missed the drive. Steam works fine for me.

Mostly what I am trying to understand about GME is what it can do to support this run up in valuation. Getting a good deal on a physical video game disc does not seem like a sustainable business plan.

And in fact in Cohen's letter to the GME board he says the company needs to pivot away from just being a video game retailer ... But there are not many details beyond that (understandably you don't reveal strategy).

But as great as Cohen was with Chewy, I guess I am not seeing the vision with GME. Esports will be a huge market, but when I think of those tournaments, I think more of an entertainment venue - not a remodeled GME store in a strip mall in suburbia. 

I do think Cohen and his 13% stake in GME makes it an interesting stock to investigate ... But is there anything of substance beyond high hopes for Cohen and his strategy? 

Cohen's ecomm experience is with a physical product, not with a product that can be digitized. Does his prior success translate into the gaming industry?

Genuinely asking!

But what news do they have? They reported earning which is why the stock was allowed to shoot up. What could they possibly announce in the next week that would prevent everyone from taking profit?
The point I was trying to make to OP was, if they are not being shorted, how can there be a “short” squeeze. The retard got upvoted 22 times...

Guys I’m from the U.K. , what app can I use on my phone to invest in GME?? That’s trustworthy and reputable?
So when did he buy the GME shares and at what price??
Not to shit on WSB parade but I think we saw, or are seeing, a squeeze. It would not surprise me if it ended up below $10 EOY.


Doesn't mean there isn't some nice money to be made in the short term though 🚀
Read the comment again. You don't skip any of the download.

Buying the "physical copy" often doesn't even get you a CD anymore (because most PCs dont even have CD drives anymore), just a slip with the download key.

“And what happened, then? Well, in WSB they say – that autist small account grew three sizes that day. And then – the true meaning of diamond-hands came through, and that retard found the strength of ten Tards, plus two!”
Retards together strong.  🚀🚀🚀
Hi fellow Singaporean Autist, let’s ride to tendietown 🚀🚀🚀

On a more serious note, I’m in this deep because IMO the risk/reward ratio is in our favour. However, do note that the current situation and with the information available, this is still highly speculative and risky.
Please be on your toes and act accordingly.
Because although we are retarded here, no 💎✊ can hold through a squeeze at 400, you have to actually be a lunatic not to sell and expect it to hold at that
Do yourself a favor and buy one DEC 17 $124 call for ARKG and just hold onto it. You'll make much more money than by playing GME or chasing some meme. Learn the value of patience. Patience is the key to making money in the market, playing weeklies and and shares in meme shit like GME is only going to lose you money because if it hits big you'll never want to go back to playing boring stuff again. Long calls give you just enough to make it more exciting than shares but they're a lot safer than weeklies and monthlies. Take this year to read some shit, watch people lose money here, and slowly add in money to buy shares of companies you like. If you want to yolo make sure you have a safety net of 6 months of expenses and max out your 401k and Roth IRA. THEN yolo. Don't just start off yoloing because that's how you become a gambling addict trying to chase your losses. Good luck
To add, if it goes up sufficiently your bank will force you to buy the stock back at any price to have you repay the loan. 

If this happens to a lot of people/shares the price will shoot up, and since more people would need to buy the stock than are available (>100%) float. It can go up really, really high.
Honestly I have no idea, nobody does! It just depends that everyone who currently has shares continues to hold them.

Saying that I’m buying shares first thing Tuesday  as I have some money that if I lose, wouldn’t be the end of the world.
Guh
You better fucking 💎🙌🏼 those 3.12 shares!
I didn’t come to WSB for DD, I want to know how to be instantly rich. Now tell me what to do!
Imo there's bubbles, not a bubble.

But I'm not sure any of this proves we're not in a bubble? Things are good until the bubble bursts, then the reverse of all that stuff happens...
It’s no “reserve” for a second vaccine dose considering production afaik. And there’s many medical professionals who support even holding off the second dose.

Money left the market for multiple reasons but selling the fact of Biden’s plans is a big one. It’s not one or the other, they’re just both incompetent in instilling confidence.

$TSM earnings were Jan 14. They have a huge demand for vehicle chips and were selected for $AAPL’s autonomous vehicle as well. They recently stated their demand for vehicle chips really only started to increase in Q4 due to Covid (and their stock still rose), so I’m expecting their prices to soar well into the future. Lastly, when they build their AZ plant, thinking long term gains or leaps.

I don't know that taking that course of action would have the desired effect.  I feel like it would be the equivalent of declaring war on 4chan at it's height.  Everything goes underground, flood of new autists from the publicity of the SEC nuking a shitposting sub and voila, retardation assaulting the market increases ten fold overnight.
Because the game has changed. In their prime days, you had to be somebody to day trade, get real time quotes, immediate order fills, etc. Now, any retard (see also: WSB) with a broadband connection and $100 can play with all the perks. They used to hate us because we weren't them. Now they hate us because we can play the same game just as quick

I don't understand you guys with this stock..

I just made money when some autist said 1-15 4c were legit and printing when it was 3.83 a share. They printed but I was always hoping for more. I also have a position for 4c 1-22. It seems to be going up but it’ll raise or lower .15 after hours everyday. 

1-22 4c printing hard FYI

Google does a lot of tracking, which many people don't want, so they use alternatives to their services.

Do you really think that's why he's dead? Over $12 million ran through his account in the Virgin Islands AFTER he was already dead. He's dead because he played in the deep end and went over his head.

Ok, I'm just a little confused.  You guys want me to buy shares or call options.

Hi, you totally don’t have to explain to a complete new retard because fuck me, but I’m a complete virgin loser to stocks and just got in early last week to stocks and shares in general, I know you’re talking about calls but can you explain what you mean by the terminology you’re using? You have 49 calls for gme to increase worth 4x value which you can exercise on jan 22? Please link me to some actual video explaining what you’re doing so I can watch it and not listen to it thanks retard x

As far as I know, this is called r/wallstreetbets not r/GME. Not every thread needs to be about GME. When bears end up winning GME (and they will, the question is when) some of you are going to vomit blood.

Didn't even know some autist created a subreddit just for GME, but here you go.
What is it?
I think you'll start to see OEM giants will start to come out with some amazing EV tech over the next few years. The Ford Mach E for example is an amazing EV that came out this year, they have a deep partnership with BlackBerry QNX. Most of the top 25 EV company's are still ok the pre mass production phase and still need to show execution. Building a prototype and getting some orders is great but prove to me you can manufactor the volume that OEM's are already capable of doing.
also people who bought pltr shares at 30 those bags have sucked last 2 months
What if they lose some value and the broker automatically sells them because they went under margin?
Guys get rid of your boomer portfolio and get in GME  and buy shares now before its to late. I bought in on friday on $39 and i am very excited for GME!
Stay strong

You're probably right. This is a great stock to swing trade. I bought last week at 23 and sold at 26 the next day. Easy peasy 15% gain. And I'm going to do it again
Amazon survived
Just need to make it through this week and then it's smoov sailing bruv. I swear, on me mam, it's the troof. Trust.
and how likely is this to happen you feel?
Godspeed.
Maybe like right at close before earnings. Otherwise I would fear a run up to like 1000 at any minute

Buy calls to max gains, 7 shares is nothing. But $500 in short termcalls could be $10 k or more
Tesla is unique in the sense that it was for the longest time the stock with the most value shorted. Yet it kept beating expectations and young investors and some institutions kept buying and not selling. I would encourage you to overlay the short interest chart and Tesla stock price. You’ll see a pattern on days it gaps higher. Everyone knows it’s over valued so shorts keep attempting to short it and losing. Causing them to buy it back at a higher price, thus bidding it higher. 

When people refer to Tesla they are referring to the behavior of the shorts. That they don’t all pile for the exits at once they just slowly get squeezed out.
This past year, the markets have done well while the economy has been poor.

Now Biden is in office. He plans to clear student loans, give stimulus, raise the minimal wage. 

If these actions cause inflation, the Fed may be forced to respond with higher interest rates to combat it, depending on the scale of the inflation.

Could them the opposite happen next year? Biden will be helping the everyday person, at the expense of the markets. 

Could we next year see a better economy while the markets do poorly?

Yeah definitely could happen but also might blow past $17. Nobody knows, probably more likely to have a drawback but just a guess. Definitely going to get past 17 eventually
Thank you hombre. I may get into the mix. I don’t see why this wouldn’t have a run up based purely off of the constant hype

Gonna wait to see what the return is. First time doing this. Learning from you guys. Found this subreddit a few days ago. 1 day too late to really cash in on GME. Still learning everything. What's your plan?

Thank you autist, some good info to think about and watch closely instead of blindly hoping for a MOASS. Appreciate the effort here 👌💎🙌 baby!
Both sleepy and pumperino are fucking my short term tendies in general. Sleepy got up in front of the nation and said “it’s going to get darker before it gets better.” Retards are smoking weed in Pelosi’s chair strapped with an AR15 and want to stir shit up and the media acts as if Senators were about to be executed. Kind of pissed off I didn’t roll out my February OTM calls, thought sleepy would’ve not been a retard but I guess that’s what happens when both sides are hysterical children. That’s saying something too, we’re all man children here and more collected than these fucktards.
Still, I am bullish. The media is pushing the fear and I’ll reevaluate it on Monday and Tuesday.
Do it, you're guaranteed to  be part of this years big WSB meme AND have good odds of making money

Is it too late to get into BB
When you break your screen, but now that it flexes slightly under every touch, it feels surprisingly comfortable to tap, scroll and text on your phone 😤👌
Please help me to remove the ones that shouldn't be there, maybe I can prove you wrong.
What's this app called?
Still not late to get into GME. Its literally on sale right now
I don’t object to people who want the “work/life balance.” That said, don’t refuse to take promotions because of that balance and then complain how life is soooo hard and how you wish you made more money. You can’t have it both ways.

My brother is an engineer at Lockheed Martin and I’ve tried to ask him “dude why don’t you get into management? It’s really not hard.”

His answer is always the same about wanting “work life balance” and “I don’t want to put in the hours.” That’s fine I guess, but then don’t go around at the holidays calling me “mr money bags” and saying how you have to buy investment properties to make the money you want. There’s jobs right now you could be doing for massive raises but you’re afraid you have to work a couple more hours a week and probably carry a work cell with you. 

As someone who has to carry a work cell everywhere, even on vacation and even over the holidays, but who went from 39k to 136k in 7 years, the cell phone is worth the fucking money. That’s my opinion.
Well good morning to you all, I’m out

Excuse my smooth brain but why shares? Are you saying shares would be more profitable than options, even long dated options?
Go read the financial statements and report back.  100% false.
At least they lowered their interest rate to 2.5%
Ah sry misunderstood. Of course I can do that. I wish I could set a sell for like $400/share right now but fidelity won't let me

If this was true the next generation of consoles would be digital only and save the cost of putting out 2 versions of the console. I am also the same way that I only like digital games but there are people out there that like having the physical copy. Parents will always go to ganestop for gifts tho because everyone likes opening a physical gift not opening a box and its just a code. Also gamestop gives you the best deal on games compared to other places (walmart Amazon and best buy)

Keep your 7 shares. If it runs again great, you have 7 shares. If it dumps hard, you only have 7 shares to loose. Wait for the next thing to FOMO into.
You have a better chance by putting that on red and covering green tbh
Jezus what a sad cuck. Went through his tweets. The pure definition of a boomer. Hurr durr decades of experience. Like that fucking shit matters in today's market.
Very good point. It's important to understand how meaningful / sustainable an anomaly will be + how much will it impact the company's bottom line. To answer these questions, the driving forces have to be understood.

I am sure the data is out there if you look.

Different uses. Bull credit spreads are great for big tickers like AMZN or Tesla cuz I can’t afford naked calls. So I like buy the 900 Tesla call and sell the 1100 so I can make 20k on like a 5k risk

Calendar spreads are great for generating free premium as income. If you hold some leaps you can then sell weeklies against them (as long as the strike of the short dated call is Atleast as high as the long dated one). I do this with a bunch of qqq 2023 leaps I have and then I day trade weeklies against them for fun

Not to be political but do some trump people hate money. They all sold their social media and tech stocks last week and if you type mypillow into search bar on Google number two suggestion was mypillow stock
Exactly. ON Semi is a good and very well known company in the sector but it has harsh competition by companies like Infineon, which formerly was part of Siemens and is an even better known company, especially in the automotive business, where they supply large numbers of intelligent power devices and application specific ICs (e.g. Mirror Control IC's) to german auto-manufacturers. Both were are at ATH just this month and in december. So I don't know what the hell OP is talking about. I guess their wifes boyfriend gave them ritalin, which calms their autism.
This was a really good layout of potential scenarios thank you. I really hope Ryan Cohen does turn out to be our daddy.

What about $TSM?
Some dude told me if PLTR would be a standard IPO where the institutions set the price it would already be over 180$ and I at first I thought he was mad but the more I read up in this shit the more I think he was right. PLTR long term is a fucking money printer.

So I’m a 24 year old who just got into the market. I have a little over 2k.. yes I know that’s nothing but I’m a broke kid right out of college. I currently have 7 shares in GME, and am debating on letting go of half my portfolio to get more shares cus this thing looks like it could skyrocket. Any thoughts
Float: Is the amount of stock not held by insiders or institutions, who might have legal restriction how and when they can sell their stock.
Short interest: Google is your friend, but public data is reported only at the 15. and 30./31. of each month and has a 7 day delay.

This is a very nice tool actually! I played around with it for a bit and quickly found the anomaly in "How invest in stocks" through Santander related searches. This search is currently seeing a HUGE spike that started at approximately 20 december. The amount of searches has never been this high before.

One thing that would add value IMO is some way to automatically add news headlines that are related to the anomalies of that particular company. Now after seeing anomalies you still have to manually find out what caused the anomaly.

TL-DR: pltr 🚀🚀🚀
the prob is if you’re holding in margin you’re helping the shorts find shares to short AND to cover. And if margin requirements increase, it leads to a dump in shares from those who no longer meet the requirements which would hurt the price. It’s basically ruining the squeeze.
It’s always something buddy. NIO, PLTR, GME. There will always be a hype train.

The ability of the brokerage to lend your shares varies by brokerage and how you're paid for the shares. Especially if you own them on margin, good luck convincing them not to lend the shares.

Sir, this is the unemployment line.
I dont understand how we are lumping tech as one thing still. I know it's basically a sector but at this point can't we see that These are just the future of all sectors. Things like Fintech( BANKING) tesla ( automotive and energy) amazon ( consumer goods and electronics) all have their own categories when they are boomer businesses but since they are new they are Tech
The total number of anomalies is not that helpful as the total number of associated keywords extremely fluctuates. Some companies have 100 keywords and some companies have a couple hundred thousand keywords.

Companies are therefore ranked by net anomalies (positive minus negative anomalies) divided by the number of keywords associated to the company/topic -> In other words: Which percentage of the company's keywords is trending?

Well my 2/19 27c don't have that long to wait I need a demo day/earnings run up
Bought 20 at 36,65... Second time buying like this. So now I wait or what? I could squeeze 5 to 10 more shares.
Here's the big issue that no one fully understands yet (both bulls and bears):

E-commerce opportunity.

Check out Roaring Kitty's YT video. 45% of people still buy physical games and this is expected to continue for years. Now that we got that out of the way:

The gaming market is, what, $175B? That means there's over $75B (at least) in offline sales for non-cloud products. What happens when Ryan Cohen takes his e-commerce expertise and applies it to GameStop? Do some research on PPC advertising. I'll give you a hit: it's why $TDOC's share price surged from $20 to $250 in about 2 years (and yet no one really knows that). There is really only one major competitor to GameStop in the digital marketing space for games, and that is Amazon. However, as big as Amazon is, they cannot focus on one category only. In theory they could but they're not showing up to the marketing meeting saying "let's drop the other 10M categories we have and go all in on gaming." This is how RC beat Amazon with Chewy. He knew Amazon can't focus on one industry only, and he took his expertise and beat Amazon in his specific niche. I'm willing to bet RC will do the same with GameStop.

TLDR: a shit ton of opportunity to acquire customers profitably from digital marketing, which can and will be a serious growth driver. People outside of that world have no idea. Only one major player right now and that is Amazon (and even they are not going hard at it). It's a matter of budget, of which is no concern to GameStop now.

Not much yet, if GME quadruples now though I might drop my job, take a year off and start working on a private venture
Tl;dr
Honestly I always thought they should pivot more towards streaming support than pc gaming.

Obviously  there's a bunch of overlap, but I think with this new generation of people wanting to be streamers and starting their own business streaming (think twitch, onlyfans, YouTube, etc) then GameSpot could sell the streaming tech and peripherals

Like if some uninformed parents have a 12 year old she/he/it child who wants to be a streamer for their birthday, where do the parents go for info?

They do what our parents did for us: march down to the nearest GameSpot and ask to be hooked up with the latest tech for their kids
dislike me all u want bois but buy some puts. I don't feel good about the coming weeks. Downsies from here until EOM
To buy more GME?
probably Burry buying millions worth of shares

We're getting a lot of suspicious posts trying to kill/diminish GME hype. The worst is a long ass one by a short seller that suggests we actually loan out shares if possible.

And 90% of the retards not reading even the positions are praising it.
If Minecraft couldn’t stick...lol forget about any internet game that can’t pivot very efficiently to new versions

Hey dickheads. Should I transition my whole portfolio to GME? 🚀🚀🚀
I bought some $5 and $7 calls for 2023 so i hope you're right, with 5 billion float it'll probably never get there but it wasn't too expensive for some lottery tickets
I see a lot of people on here thinking Tesla won't rally before earnings, but I think it's going to go crazy again. Sure, it's gone crazy over the last year, but looking into earnings, Tesla is prime for some FOMO.

They have 100mio earmarked for buy back. They also have a 100 mio shelf offer. 
Reduce outstanding by  five million shares on one day, get the money back by selling two million the next day.

Would that be smart? No
Would that by legal? Doubtful
Would it be a hell of a ride? Fuck yeah!
I have those dreams every night and then I make them a reality the next trading day. Dreams really do come true.

Isnt this based off solar efficiency as of today. Aren't we still only achieving about 15%. The key to what companies like tesla are doing is energy storage because we lose 25% of our energy in the transfer process

When I was 18, I had no idea how to "get" women so I brushed off a really decent chance I had with a girl I was crushing on for a year at the time. It could have altered the course of my life. This was also before tinder and other modern dating apps got really popular and entirely ruined dating for men. It wasn't the last time either, as I fucked up a couple future opportunities too with other girls. 

Now that I'm older and actually how how to "get" women, unfortunately the only women I've been able to get are fat with mental problems.

Honestly, if GME wants to win big they need to turn into showrooms. Have the various publishers pay them to let people try games at their store, have fancy posters/cardboard stands for whatever game they're paid to hype up, basically turn it into the place bored teens go to when they're out of elementary/high school where they get jacked up to the tits on excitement for the new toy.

That build-a-pc thing I saw a while back was a solid idea too. Brick and mortar for something that's going to continue to become more and more digital makes a ton of sense if it's used like a showroom environment. Bet EA/Ubi/MS/Sony would dump a pretty penny into having every town in America have their new triple-a game be free to try like the week it comes out (probably with some time limit so they can't just blitz through it if it's SP).
So I thought my tinder date was a quick pump and dump, however she keeps messaging me and I'd much rather be jacking off to the GME hulk dicks this week. What's the best way to get rid of her?

And some people just get value out of having a physical collection. Personally I wish I had kept every single game console and game that I’ve ever owned. 

Strong right in the feels. 🚀
I thought the same thing. I still think $90 EOY would be insane. But looking at it, the market cap is only $5.4B. The market cap would be less than $51B at $90/share. That’s still big (slightly bigger than PLTR and slightly smaller than TEAM, for reference), but there are enterprise cyber security companies worth ~$25B right now—and that’s just one of BB’s plays. 

If BB was a startup in 2017 and had the assets and ambitions they have right now, i firmly believe it’d be one of the hundreds or thousands of overhyped, future-priced tech companies out in the market right now. Because they’re an old company that pivoted though, they’ll just have to wait for their profit to start outpacing their reinvestment to get the forward looking valuation other companies are getting. If that starts happening in multiple parts of their business simultaneously—🚀🚀🚀 $90 will just be a brief check point.

Again. Even if it all works out, it’ll prob take time and grow over several years. But never say never.
Same as you buddy, I was in and out...I luckily bought back in the day of the Cathie Woods news, bought myself $115k in shares.

Where do you get your short interest numbers from
1 year ago.. Yes! Today... no :/
Ah, didn’t realize that was for threads and not comments.

I agree 100% though, anytime I even mention the VIX or have bearish sentiment about their holy tickers — I get downvoted swiftly.

& it is ridiculously annoying to not only *read* a solid piece of DD only to see idiots disregarding it in the comments due to its lack of rocket emojis — but as I believe you touched on, it’s more annoying for the writer of the DD who may be unlikely to continue sharing good information & possibly even deter others from doing so as well.

I’m unsure of the solution.  Not familiar with Reddit to the point of understanding how mods operate or what their abilities are.  

I’d say a new sub would be in order but it would be impossible to herd only the quality posters into a new area without a bunch of morons joining in or just massively losing the majority of community members here in an attempted shift.

Whats the play on BB?  Im Ignatius on it
Guess I’ll set it to 420.69, anyway my idea is to put 800 € in my account use 400 of them with 1:2 leverage so even if it goes down the broker can’t close my position because of margin. 
You think it will work?
Good points. I'm split between shares in MT and PLTR. Would be good to see some gains on MT soon, then I might consider getting in to PLTR options. I'm a noob.
We're in 'Tard land pal, we don't like that kind of sound rhetoric in here

Pltr is still very cheap, perfect time to buy and hold.  You gotta hold with this one, be patient
Firstly, thank you for seriously good DD, following you your posts are incredible informative and are hella useful. What do you think about margin requirements going up for shorts too ? Doesn’t that mean the squeeze is very imminent which would also create a huge gamma squeeze for the MMs on Tuesday or during the week ?
Starting to feel like a boomer with all these anime memes around
This is what im doing different. I only do one or two picks at a time (Im actually holding positions in three things now. WTF. First time for everything). Fuck diversification. Even if its our picks.

I find its easier to get off sinking ship than to ride multiple rockets.
Palantir for me is a hold as an investment for at least 2 years. I ran into Gotham twice in the last 4 years and when I found out they IPO'd I bought 600 shares. It's only going to go up from here. 

BB is trying to realign itself into other sectors and finally accept the PED sector is lost. It will probably be a few months to a year before we see if they has the possibility of being successful long term. 

Both are having huge 20-40% swings every few months from speculation, IV, and MM short term plays. If you timed PLTR options in the just last month (I got a few right, made around 2K from 750) you can easily be rolling in decent money on all this volatility. That said you could also be unlucky and that shit goes either direction for no reason some weeks. 

I am half boomer mindset half retard. Large amounts in shares, fuck with options every week for fun.
Because it's risky and they expect it to go down
I salute you sir for holding through March and April of 2020. Most people don't have the diamond balls to do so.
I did actually re read the other two posts last night as well, you are right it is interesting to see the perspective back then with our knowledge now.  
  
I agree with you and think those 3 things are compelling enough on their own to continue with the play. In my eyes the biggest concern in the immediate short term is GME announcing another offering.
Too cluttered.
Please short 🙏
Hehe
Yo, you've been on WSB for what, half a year? Do you still not know what this place is about? Lambos, hookers and coke...or die trying. WTF is $35K gonna do for me (or anyone for that matter), hmm??

Yolo on BB.
Earlier last week, I was extremely close to selling 1/15 20c (covered) calls after bag holding shares for weeks, but chose not to.
Why are we buying BB, I am out of the loop on this one.

Okay, what happens in the downtime between console releases?

>Data is a key asset as the company can use it to analyse new trends in gaming
>Data can be monetized by selling it to gaming manufacturers or developers


Outside of tracking customer behavior on their website and sales and trade-in data what else can they even collect? Developers and manufacturers have multiple, and probably better ways of collecting data already and I don't think whatever sort of data GS can gather will be worth much.


>Turning physical stores into a showcase vendor’s games or new concepts


That's what youtube is for...


>Possibility to create a neutral platform for trading digital goods and charge a small fee for facilitating transactions


Like Steam's marketplace? Aren't most tradeable items on Steam from Valve games? This idea would require games from unrelated devs to have tradeable digital goods and that they would sign it over to GameStop's trading platform, but why would they do that? What would they gain out of it? Or are you talking about digital goods like digital copies of games? No gaming company would allow trading/reselling of digital copies of games. This idea is a non-starter.


>E-sports tournaments/leagues to be held at physical stores


This idea of turning physical stores into social hangouts like the Warhammer DnD game stores is a little sketchy. Because 1) it requires investment into physical space and 2) it essentially turns the store into a PC bang which only really works in Asia due to costs and culture. Furthermore, why would I go out of my way to play games with a bunch of sweaty nerds at a GS store when I could just do it at home without smelling their BO?

Well, yes, because there's no clear path to long term revenue



TLDR The bull case points aren't very convincing...
52% in institution that wont sell, 20% in cohen and co, 5-10% in board and insiders  leaves 23% of the float available, less than Volkswagen.

Hey quick question for y’all, cuz you know retard here.. 

I’m confused about calls cuz I thought to make money you had to have the stock price over the break even? However on Friday I had my 1/29 12c calls and even when bb was lower than 12 I was still profiting for a minute. Why is that?
Did they announce this Friday? I didn't get a chance to check for the update.
And I think the guy you're replying to is implying that 40 starting age for retirement means he has probably another 45 years to go without a job, and that (in his words) "maybe 2% of posters here have made gains that high" implying enough for a person to actually retire at 40 and be set for the remainder (45 years) of their life.

Now this is more of what I was expecting. I appreciate your reply. 

I don’t know. I agree with you on that. All I can deduce on probability is what I read from articles. Your first hand knowledge is what I would love to know, and it’s why I pressed you for details. Because being dumb I can accept; ignorance I can not. 

You saying that you have used it and love it, that it’s a good system, and that they make more from airlines and other public sector sources is all great news to me. I do hope the company does well. 

I hope you do too.
It only removes the meme threads. But those aren't annoying, they're actually funny and help funnel the spam a little.

The problem lies in the comments, someone posts a bear opinion, even though based on facts and analysis, and gets downvoted to hell because these idiots don't understand stocks can also go down.

Someone posts an interesting DD, and the little interesting input is drowned in rocket emojis.

You say that, but the occasional *quality* DD on this sub far outshines anyhting you'd find on r/investing. It's just becoming increasingly sparse cuz of the million and one bs posts about a stock going up as it happens.

I mean I'm illiterate, but I'm not colorblind, so I can see GME is up when I look at the fucking screen. Don't need half of this sub to remind me also.

Think there could be another big dip when the new corona mutant takes off here in like a month?
Agree to disagree... No need to be like that
LAC 🚀🚀🚀
what do u think is the reason that consensus is the short squeeze should happen in the next week or two? If Friday's drop was the beginning of a full week mini-correction, then wouldn't the short squeeze be halted? I have 300 shares and 2 call options that expire Jan 29. I would like to sell the calls at either the end of the next week or Monday/Tues of the following week. I was bummed that the short squeeze didn't kickoff on Friday. I actually don't know why it didn't continue on Friday. I guess because the wider markets were down?  But there still some stocks that had a good day such as Palantir.
How long is long?
Tickers?
Imagine you walk into a Wendy’s and say this
My understanding is that those shares on margin can be lent to help the shorts cover, not helping the squeeze.

Seen a few similar posts to this/ comments and the responses are typically “how much did you lose?”. I’m new to this and haven’t added any value but still agree with your point
r/investing is for long term and lower risk.

r/wallstreetbets is for short term and higher risk.

What does that have to do with spamming 🚀 🚀 🚀 and trying to do market manipulation ?

Hey... I have seen this one...
I haven’t tried it yet but I noticed a “no meme mode” button in the daily threads.  Does this do anything?

Also, this happens all the time here — wait for one REAL red day and half of these idiots will be back in the Wendy’s drive thru ordering job applications.

I’d love to say it was just as bad here when TSLA had its massive run up, and it WAS bad, but due to the MUCH smaller market cap/share price stocks like GME it’s much worse now.  

Once these dummies blow their stimulus and realize uppies doesn’t always happen they will be gone, and replaced by an influx of newer, dumber retards.
idk i just saw the huge dip and thought id mention it..
Who Is Melvin? Sounds like a douche
Yeah just got out of nio monday and upped my positions here because another company to compare them to would be FUTU which has a much larger market cap and I’m thinking we’ll see TIGR reach that.

There wont be a crash, it will be a sinkhole
No, I mean no matter how many metrics you bring forward it means nothing. It's the thing that you didn't look at that will cause a crash.

Markets =/= economy

After a crash, economists will find the reason for the crash and add new metrics to their watchlist. That's why it will not happen again, not in the same way. Thats why these metrics do not mean much.
Probably more of a correction on some stocks than an actual bubble/recession, it will still push the paper hands to sell all they got and drag the whole market down. Most reasonably priced stocks will return to their fair value within 1-3 months and the absolute nuts valuations will rubberband back to where they should, which is great as it allows us to take them back to 123850x revenue again!
I read about that too but can’t find the source, where do you check that?
I wont let the money change me
I have to kinda agree. I started my career making $39k in south Florida with $200k student loan debt. That was 7 years ago. If I had stayed at that job I would probably still be making near that. I had to transfer to a smaller city, and then hop jobs 3 more times to get where I am. I’ve been at 4 employers in 7 years but each one was a promotion. Now I’m basically the boss in my area. I have a total of 125 statewide reports, and 11 supervisors who report to me. Why? I wasn’t afraid to work and take on whatever I was asked to do.

I’ve gone to employees and tried to offer them promotions or money and I can’t tell you how many times they have been like “uhh so what would I have to do?” Then they tell me they will think about it and never get back to me. It’s like “dude you told me you wanted more money, but you refuse to take on more responsibility?” Anyway, long story short, many complacent people.
Good luck brother!
what do you think about BB ?
go to your broker's website and find out
Hi!

GME is a solid investment and will explode soon. I got in late at 40$ myself but i am confident. Whenever a new game cycle begins business soars for a couple of years for GME. This is only the beginning and people have not even gotten their hands on their PS5 and XBOX because its sold out everywhere. Also Cohen will make Gamestop the Amazon for gaming
Exactly. Noone settled shit. It stopped at 124 and he went bankrupt
Morning 🌈🐻,🐍,🐂
Can someone explain an Eurofag (me), how a shop, that is selling physical copies of games in 2020 and is going digital can compete with such monstrosity in this area as Steam? Then there are GOG, EpicGamesStore, Uplay, Origin, XBox/PS platform stores.

Steam has enormous ecosystem around its games - soc network like community tool, workshop for modders, marketplace for in-game items, streams - everything available from their desktop client. Does GME have something like this? If not, it is huge money sink to make. GOG compensates for lack of features on their platform by going DRM free. Other platforms push games exclusivity.

I get the concept of buying used console disks, because they are cheaper, but given that subscription model like XBox Game Pass is getting momentum, digital purchases are going to eat up huge chunk of physical sales no?
You got calls or shares in gme
So you are telling me there wasn't a crash in 2000?

He's on 15.000k = 15Million according to his comment. So you get on his level
Until the market goes down this community is going to be populated with 90% toxic kids spamming rocket emojis who think STONKS ONLY GO UP.

When the bears end up winning on something, they'll shut their mouth for a bit until the next hype and this community can become livable again.

What I've noticed here is that there are a few intelligent people trying to make sense and betting based on facts and data. However, most of them are just retards investing on memes and spamming rocket emojis, convincing themselves they're unbeatable.

Hello fellow degenerate!
what do you think about BB ?
No man, It is more like Nikola. This is not a stock I pay much attention to but everything I read about this company says that it will fold in maybe a year. The company has no strategy moving forward and it would be fair to call it the next Blockbuster.
Market doesn't care
Its really all up to Cohen. If he gets all institutional investors on board to hold shares they could pump the stock to any number and then issue shares at those numbers. Then use that cash to buy whatever company he wants.
Yeah right I misspelled that. Thanks fellow retard.
Good student. But if textbooks could make you rich, every Econ graduate would be a billionaire
Nah, you still profit from it. Only "downside" is that it increases the shares available to short and makes a squeeze a tiny bit less likely (a tiny, tiny, tiny bit because you probably won't hold a ton of shares).


I think setting a limit sell order for a really high price (like $200) makes sure that your broker cannot lend your shares to others
Yeah I wasn’t expecting the moon to be much over $100 honestly— although I’ll wish for the best! I’m just   quite curious to see how this plays out.

Tim 🍏, Imma need you to stop playing with those red dildos and grab a green one this week. I dont care what you do after that.
I bought the super mega dip so there never a red day 🤣
Be sure to set a high sell limit like 420.69 so they can't be borrowed! 🚀🚀🚀
So even if gme goes to 500 you will have like $180 ?
I’m new to this. Can you explain why Tuesday?
I suppose you could consider it a re-opening play as well
Bro chill the next market crash will be after the World Cup haha 2026

meh, you did the logical thing. no one could've predicted the run it's been on

it makes no sense
This is a nice post and has some good information and a cracking story! I don’t exactly get what’s the connection between Haines and Palantir though could you explain it more? Is she connected to the company directly or something ?
As you should. But there are people here with absolute 0 financial background that will still hold on without understanding the economics which will end up landing them in an even worse situation than bag holders and 🌈🐻. My comment was for the ultra-autismo people.
Deals like this are going to stop big companies like MSFT from eating their breakfast.

As far as I know, some guys bought shares on a margin and the shorters could lend these margin shares which drives the price down, a high sell target stops your broker from lending them away. (??? Absolutely not sure about this one)


Also: If a bunch of paperhands sell their shares at let's say 60$ then the price will stay lower than it could be...



The longer we hold our shares the more the price rockets.🚀🚀🚀


I recommend you read all those beautiful DDs that are out there concerning GME to get a better picture.


Don't take my word for granted since I'm certainly retarded. Good luck mate
You just talked shit to someone else for speaking only 1 language. You act like you're smart because you speak 4 languages. Shut the fuck up about good intentions, you just came to talk shit and act like you know something, which you clearly don't. 

PS your "good perspective" is bullshit too, most of your points are not only irrelevant and backwards-looking, you're completely disregarding everything that's happened with GME in recent months by claiming that the only reason GME is up right now is because "WSB is pumping it". You know nothing, "BernardoDeGalvez"🥴

Is that a NKLA truck?
tbh if it does reach 100 iam definitely selling atleast a third of my 900 shares and letting the rest ride
So... so you’re mad it’s a good story? 

I’m sorry bro-I don’t know what to tell you.
Why people think it will be green on Tuesday after a red week ? Govt changing .. Capitol riot control news etc ..
This is the way
nice.
If you’re that retarded let me shed some light. $100 is us being liberally optimistic. Here’s some actual advice (ready for downvotes).

Just because we set a price target of $420.69 with a meme in mind, personally i don’t even see it going beyond $150 on the sunniest day. Yes you have to diamond hand, true. But there will be a lot of people pulling out at $100 because this is bread and butter for them. Be realistic and set your own exit point. Enjoy what you get and don’t post it here, you will get roasted.

Yup.  Wouldn’t help shorts hardly at all. I view it as a positive for the stock.  With 100 million it primes them for less debt, and then getting a better rating which allows more to invest in them & they can get a much better rate.

Short term people think it will go up because there are way too many short positions open that drove it too low.  Long term there is faith in a new CEO taking GME to new levels particularly with eCommerce.  Someone with more shares can correct me if that’s not right, I’m just a 14 share idiot.  🚀🚀🚀

What do you think about the argument DFV makes in his videos that at least the thesis of bankrupcy is now much less likely to come to fruition with a renewed board (& possible change of CEO) with a new vision for the company? The higher stock price will also eventually open the door for an extra offering to raise more money and build cash reserves. These factors alone should remove some of the more aggressive shorts that are banking on bankrupcy.
I have a bet with a friend about investing, and I need to prove that you don’t need an MBA to make a living as a trader. We choose an amount of $3000 to start with, and he is going to invest wisely, and I am going to take the autist approach. What would be the best trade to YOLO it on starting Monday?
indeed i predict the stock will move
next week.
Isn’t that what all people do
I don’t like having gains cuz then I have to worry about taxes. Much better to gamble aimlessly and not worry about tax
Who hurt you bro?
They are dates. 3/19 is march 19th. They're related to the expiry of the contract that was purchased. I only have a rudimentary understanding of calls, but 3/19 $12 essentially means that the purchaser is betting the share price will be 12 dollars by march 19th and stands to profit as that becomes reality.
don't get greedy.  take your profits and save up for the pltr 🚀
😂 strawman
$PLTR 🚀🚀🚀 Thanks Cathie babe.

Oh ya these are hot, play it smart. I was down PLTR 28.5C 1/15 the whole time I had them till expiration day, sold for 1k profit. Lucky
I like where you're going with PLTR
Is it worth me buying shares Monday? I know it's just an opinion and I should do my own dd. Is this just pump & dump like spce last year or is this a good investment for the next 3-6months? Feel like I've missed the train as it went so quickly

I'm no gay bear, but surely selling at peaks and then buying back MORE shares in the dips is the ultimate big brain play since at the end were buying even more of the float.
Measly 40 shares checking in 🚀
That’s a lie you’ll keep telling yourself until you won’t, and then it might actually be too late. I come from an impoverished background, work 14-hour days (70-80hrs a week), and this is my second degree I am nearly finished with (nights/weekends—it’s exhausting, but that six digit salary I’m creeping on in my five year plan ain’t gonna manifest itself). Where there is a will there is a way. The only one that has to believe is you... but I believe you can do it, if you really want it.
Working hard for those ccp 50 cents I see.
There’s more to GME than just the squeeze, which hasn’t squoze either
Who the fuck ever used windows NT or ME?!
F U C K  M E L V I N
This is the way
I don’t understand how people with so much money don’t buy leaps and just exercise em once they’re ITM. It only costs maybe 200$ vs dipping all your cash in one play you can diversify the this way in many different leaps. Options are meant for that
There are two types of options:

>**American options allow a trader to exercise their buy or sell an option at any time before the option’s expiration date.**  
>  
>**European options specify that a trader can only choose to exercise (or not) his option** ***on*** **the date of expiration.**

This subreddit will mostly be American. Meaning the guy could've sold his call options on 01/13 or exercised them. (You can not exercise European before expiration date but can sell them)

I don't think exercising before the expiration date is smart: if stock goes up you can still buy at the same call price at expiration date, if it goes down you will be sad you bought before expiration date (because you could've bought cheaper at expiration date).
it's dipped now, jump back in tuesday premarket
You are gonna be a millionaire
They're up right now, I could have sold for a nice lick friday morning... With the amount of taxes we have to pay on short term gains a couple thousand isn't worth it, unless it's to pull your money out. If money is made take out your initial investment and YOLO with those gains, just my 2 cents. Ready for Tuesday
I'm not 100% sure, but I think its more a feature of simply having a margin account. They have control over all your securities, so that they can be used as collateral and other ways that benefit them.
it already did. from what I've seen, shorts interest appears to be up to 70M from 68M. retail investors won't be able to with the new margin requirements though
Yeah well I hope you like the taste of my dick lol. Sloppy seconds isn't something to be proud about. Fucking idiot lol
pltr is going above 30 this week
Needs more 🚀🚀🚀
But there is no risk in buying the share if you use your own capital. You can only go down to zero. If you short by borrowing, there is infinite risk because the price can keep rising.
Curious what Burry has been up to during all of this. 
According to Sept filings he still has 1.7m shares of GME.

So given COVID has been around almost a year and these complications in survivors would have been treated and such... for almost a year, wouldn’t this finding already be priced in to the stock? If anything, in the Q3 earnings report? What’s special about the Q4? 

Further, isn’t Bayer generally the generic brand supplier, meaning that if I was coming out of the hospital with a prescription for blood thinners from my doc, I probably would get the prescribed brand rather than the generic Bayer?

Genuinely curious. My statement isn’t backed by any research, just guessing on intuition.

I have just finished a 10 mile walk on a crisp sunny morning, and am all in on PLTR. Life is good.
Like all you fellow Autists, you no doubt like me  have been thinking what you’d do with your profits if GME does moon.Today I realised what that’s going to be for me, if the historic squeeze is initiated I’ll be snagging a BMW M3 with a personalised number plate that says ‘MELV1N’. If for whatever reason due to having diamond hands and this stock falls out of the sky quicker than Newton’s Apple I’ll be getting a goldfish, which I’ll also call Melvin just so it can serve as a reminder of how special I am. 💎🖐🏻
You’re going to get burnt if you bought gme on margin...
He wouldn't see them cause he wouldn't be a cuck redditor
I'm new to investing and I want to join the crusade against the fagget Melvin. Is it not too late to get in? If I diamond hand this shit for the next few weeks then what is the expected price target?
It's for the divorce. His wife's boyfriend's taking half and he has to figure out how much lube to deduct.
Idk this seems like a honeypot by Melvin to size up our autism and try to figure out how much liquidity we still have
What is your average price? I would sell of a small portion at a profit if reasonable to free up margin. I would wait until the premarket on tuesday to see whats up, margin is scary stuff as it allows others to make your decisions for you.
The technicals of the chart look like we're about to break resistance and run to ATH. 

Are there options for this ticker?

He forced the dude who sold him the calls to buy the stock and effectively pump it further. Exercise those calls! Didn’t SoftBank do something similar. Bought sooooooo many calls they made billions because the underlying stocks got pumped so hard by market makers covering their sold calls and laying off risk.
[removed]
Yeah, exactly. 100M at $50 share price is 2M shares, like 5 minutes of trading. And we'd get diluted like 1%. And the shorts would only be able to cover 2M out of 70M+ short shares.
They sold their foundry for a huge markup so proceeds were part of the E. Obviously that is one off However they paid off all their debt so they are going to have a much higher E compared to 2019 given 0 interest payments
Enter limit price: 🚀

Already did. Shorts got out last week. We have outdated info.
Isn't buy high sell low the motto here...?  
On a more serious note, I rode $13 to $30 with small money on options and used the gains and liquidated all other positions to trade shares to join the cause(short squeeze).
Not close to any european country and miles better than most 3rd world countries.

I assumed I already missed whatever was happening with GME over the last few weeks, but all these rockets and graphs are getting me PUMPED to buy a few hundred worth of a stock I don't truly believe in on Tuesday open, if only to be financially and emotionally invested in the memes.

No GME positions currently, but I am curious what others think: How does Cohen's experience in the pet food/supply industry translate to GME where digital D2C trend is already taking place? 

When I buy a game these days, I just do so via the Playstation network. I used to game on desktop too and eventually was only using Steam. When looking at the Total Addressable Market, where does GME fit in to the landscape in 3-5 years?

Hoping for a couple of non-retarded answers as I'd like to understand this better. What am I missing other than a potential short squeeze spike in the short term?

I’d feel like if it hits $200, or even $100 there will be greedy 📝🖐’s  that start to sell and once people see the mooning going down even for a second, that will just lead into a snowball effect of selling?
We should all set the limit sell order at 420.69 so we can actually see how many shares we have in GME as a group
It went through a squeeze on Xetra market back in 2008.
All in pltr the very day citron shorted. Panic sold everything like a little bitch (didn't know anything yet).  
/Edit: Still shaking my head how i could've been that stupid.
The bear GME DD has a ton of awards. Also has advice like “lend your GME shares to be shorted”, and “the shorts have covered”. 🙄
don't risk what you can't afford to lose
I diamond handed TSLA calls that were up 400% , then sold it with a loss
Maybe in a year or two they’ll start listening to the wsb community.

You Americans and your holidays.  The fk man.  We just had Christmas, Happy New Year.  Now you gotta throw MLK day in mid January?  Shit is wack.  Move that to March or something and balance your shit out
Can you provide the data for this please? I can't find the historical data to that fidelity anywhere!
Someone say GME? Needs more 🚀🚀🚀
there's a chance for a squeeze, but ffs don't tell non-retards it's a guaranteed thing, because it's not
Fuck it going in on monday🚀🚀🚀
Lol it won't work
youre gay as fuck 🦧🌈
Do you have two portfolios so you are diversified?
$80!?!

Can I buy half a share?
2 weeks is fair. If it’s going to happen I’m assuming we’ll know soon enough.
Yep, kicked me out Friday.  I've been in since $9 and buying the dips until I accumulated 9k shares.  Friday GME was up to 41 so I set my stop at 35 as I needed to step away.  Sure as shit it triggered.  I swear every single time I set a stop the algos come to get me.  I know its good risk management for day trading, but man, need to figure out my next play with GME.
Why are bears so triggered by this stock lmao
The VW squeeze hit 1000 for on a few fifteen minute intervals (up from about an average of 200), but the 2 major days that it lasted it opened and closed around 400-500.

If everything was the same, then GME would be around $80-$200, but I think this time is much bigger, so... possibly $1000?
Begin on YouTube and Google. Come back when you have loss porn.
Here we all are trying to profit on the "greed" of all these companies, right?
Confirmation bias makes my pp hard
Yeah, it’s two sided.  But it’s a fair take (not always right, but fair).  I don’t mean fair as in a fair & balanced view of us, but fair as in that’s his view.  


And, BBBY wouldn’t be a terrible idea (in July when everything starts to open up), but I think he is over estimating our collective organization lol 


We aren’t a hedge fund who makes moves.  We just buy the memes when we feel like it.

You ruined it
Wrong. You can’t do data governance in Tableau. You can’t develop and deliver machine learning in Tableau. It’s a tool for making dashboards you nimrod. They came out with Tableau prep to help with ETL but it’s just ok. Tableau makes pretty pictures. That’s really it.
> He bought TSLA 01/15 1000C. 55 contracts = 5500 shares?

Yes, the right to buy 5500 shares at $1000 (he could also sell those rights if he does not have the money to exercise them)

>Buying a call you only risk to lose money that you used to buy this call right? No more?

Yes, at 01/15 he did not use the right (because stock price was lower) so he lost the investment.

>Is 1000 a strike price? It is also his dreams of TSLA hitting 1000 or past 1000 when 01/15 pass?

He wanted the stock price to be 1000 + the premium he paid on the call, this had to be on 01/15 at latest.   
If for example price for the call was 10$ (that is 10$ per share so 1000$ for the contract (100 shares) he would need the stock to go to $1010 to break even.

>How much he paid for this option?

No idea
You have to familiarize yourself with option greeks.   
[https://brilliant.org/wiki/option-greeks-theta/?subtopic=derivatives-2&chapter=option-greeks](https://brilliant.org/wiki/option-greeks-theta/?subtopic=derivatives-2&chapter=option-greeks)
So this guy risked 1000*100 or his money?
Go with ur gut

Myself I’ll probably, when GME hopefully reaches at least $100, sell half of my shares, to lock in some profit.
And fairly low volume too. Not sure what happened back in 2015, but the price collapsed quickly. I would suggest every do their DD thoroughly before diving in.

That said, the retard strength of WSB buys into shit like Hertz, so there's always hope.

WSB is full of the same 5 trade ideas, it’s really just a bunch of followers these days unfortunately most people can’t come up with their own ideas.
The GME squeeze will not look at all like the VW squeeze unless someone is silently amassing a substantial portion of GME shares. That is what happened to VW with Porsche acquiring 74% of VW and per German regulations, a German state permanently held 20%. [1] Leaving only 5% float to cover the 12.8% of shares that were borrowed for short sale.

Cohen and his compatriots can't be doing this as they have a standstill agreement with the GME board that limits their effective ownership to 20% for a while. [2] Going beyond 20% would trigger corporate regulations that would potentially make RC Ventures and GME a business combination.

Further, if you look at the current GME ownership, you'll see 52% is currently held by mutual funds, many being passive funds that are limited to transacting stocks due to market conditions. [3] E.g., Vanguard can't write an option contract that would liquidate their GME holdings to someone looking to silently amass GME ownership.

It's bad if paper handed maggots keep selling. If nobody sells, shorties can't short if uptick rule is in place. BUT, we do not know what market movers are thinking, so there is still a risk longs with margin might get called.

BBY is cutting labor like crazy. They can’t even keep up with current online sale fulfillment rather than in store customers. Why order from there and get your product in a week when you can just Amazon in one day
What is the single worst trade you have made in your "career"?
of course they will have, for them opening a short position now compared to at 20$

IBKR makes money from commissions and they will make every possible product available to their users 

so shorts being available is not necessarily a bearish sign
Not buy FDs
There is nothing wrong with people who are ok with living with what they have.

The problem is, there are too many people who want more. Then fuckers get together, scheme and shit happens.

Oh boy, I can’t wait for the market to open on Monday!

Maybe so, but he’s got too much pressure to make some moves in regards to clean energy. I know ICLN is only like a minority holding of US companies, but clean energy will be the future. My April calls might not print but if I bet your ass in 10 years solar, wind, geothermal will be massive!
Completely agree. I told a few friends about GME just before Christmas and on 28th December, when they would have bought, it shot up to over $20 and then tanked. They probably panicked and sold, but if they didn’t, only a few days holding on would have made all the difference.

All of us profit take at one point or another. But that part is harder to notice on these forums since most of us wont post that we sold off our piece while others are still holding.

So thats why I think of this of a game of dimensional multiplayer chess.

fellow singaporean, GME bear thesis is really quite jialat. GME store close to cut costs. GME should be evolving away from brick and mortar. Console cycle is quite obvious, just like the bak kwa cycle upcoming CNY, we all know who’s gonna make big bucks during this cycle. Directors take profit yes, but they took profits due to their inability to hold so much shares/ out of GME they go when mr RC and gang takes over
I’ll take that bet & I don’t care if he’s doing it to help himself, isn’t that why we are all being retarded? 


As long as he’s fair & provides a reasonable take on what’s going on, I welcome him to the party.  It’s nice to be taken seriously.  Because on the surface level we appear not to be, but there are a ton of very intelligent people on this forum.  Intelligent doesn’t always mean successful at investing.

Yup.  It’s weird to think about, but increased share price is actually an asset.  There were a lot of respectable people who pointed it out with Tesla.  If the share price & momentum are stronger.  It’s easier to raise money.  That is an actual advantage.  


TSLA sold 5 billion of shares before S&P inclusion and no one batted an eye. 


GME’s 100 million potential sale is going to dilute the stock a lot less at this point than a week ago (if they decide to do it).  No one would even notice since we are having volumes of 50 million shares daily.
35 shares and adding another 35 on Tuesday. Fuck Melvin & 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

So let me get this straight, a lot of us have been here once it was clear GameStop could weather an economic shutdown. Now we are starting a new cycle, the company is profitable now for the first time in years, a new e-commerce guru has just done a semi-hostile take over and brought his buddies to steer the ship with him, but you want us to sell. We’ve owned it through the worst quarters and now when it’s finally turning around you want us to dump it lol. 

Only 2 things will get me to sell my 2,810 shares:
1. Mr. Cohen decides to give up and move on from GameStop. (Very unlikely since he’s now an insider with 13% ownership of the company)

2. Violent short squeeze occurs and GameStop pills a Volkswagen or Overstock. 

Idk where this company will be in 5 years but I like what I’m hearing from the new management. I would suggest you read up on their filings and their reasoning behind wanting to take over GameStop.
Well, 80% of Musk's net worth is in Tesla..

Some smarter retards than me wrote already about this: but basically the peak will not be an instant jump for a few seconds and then crash down again. It's likely to climb for days, no one knows when it's peaked - that's why it's important to hold your shares and set an absurdly high sell target like $694.20.
Just FYI Cohen signed an agreement stating he can’t load up more shares. HOWEVER, he got two board members in who definitely can (and have to iirc).
gme can adapt. a m c has no choice but to give up and sell their assets.
Started with 70k 2 months ago and am up to 130k now. Most of that came from SPACs, PLTR and NIO. I somehow lost money on GME twice and totally missed the run-up because I am a full degenerate.

I think our only ability to really monitor RC entries are through insider purchase filings and to speculate on floor movements. 

You do bring up an interesting point regarding the calls. It's really complex when you bring in the effects it has on the need for hedging by several different stakeholders on both sides, but from a covering point of view there was a theory that me and a few others were discussing but never really went deep with because we felt the volume didn't check out. It's that when the price was rising the shorts were buying calls and exercising literally exactly as they became ITM, basically covering without having to purchase on the floor and raise the price whilst only forfeiting the premium (a cheap price to pay vs. a squeeze). The counterarguments are that the sheer amount of volume needed of options contracts is huge. They would need a few 100k calls to cover half the position. The argument is that that many calls would actually affect the underlying, have a high premium cause of IV peaking (even though again risk-wise its worth), and a lot of people would have noticed that the calls they sold were being exercised not deep enough into the money (since covering the underlying with just the barely needed moneyness is more valuable since their are more shares to cover than there are contracts that need premium broken even 100-1 per contract). Again though, the volume and the multiple dynamics make it a bit unclear.
are there any $5 FDs though

You're not smart. Not only because the language.

But a smart person believes in himself, not in analysts.

A smart person does his own due diligence, goes to the 10K, reads the financial statements, looks for red flags, and then uses his reasoning.

You, on the other hand, are a product of reddit.

You are on this GME boat because you wanted to surf the wave your brothers pumped. And your only knowledge is to repeat the things we've all seen here.

You didn't do nothing. But you think you know something. And you have the balls to mock me when it's clear that you're the dumb one.
Made me a degenerate
Not fixing the technical problems is a business problem.
Not to mention resale potential. Or the ability to loan physical copies out to nonexistent friends.
I have 145C feb 19th calls. Down like 50% right now, but I expect a 20% pump after earnings. This is a boomer stock though, so it CAN totally go tits up.
Not yet. I'm giving it 3 months.
Just for this.  You can’t short squeeze with options.  It’s a lack of shares that increases the borrowing rate for shorts and increase the price.
Fuck am I doing up
I'm with you. Just in case.
If I can skip downloading 50 GB, I will do it. If the tech somehow gets better,  then even better. On PC, a modern warfare installation is like 500GB.

Yes. See my other comment.
Also 1000000% agree with your nickname.
I would love to include graphs, reports, screenshots.. but I have only 3 hours to spare. Please forgive me.
You know I was getting real discouraged reading the first half😂 but us noob tards all learn from the veterans around here and I think  everyone new here that’s invested in this GME hype train (including myself) should definitely read this through. Hopefully we’ll be able to stay strong thru this next week and see strong 💎🖐’s.

Also question for OP- Examples of past failed extremely hyped up WSB meme stocks that people invested their damn life savings into?
Volkswagen?
Don’t have much, but 3 shares over here.

NO BB IS BITCH
Time to double down on your position
Damn those are some pure goals 🥲, I just want this to moon so I can get me a bmw 4 series at 21y/o cash
GME = Gains, Moon, ?
I agree, boomer is a mind set. Dominated by old people but not exclusive to them. I am in my 50's and go to music festivals and play video games, build my computers and like to go camping on shrooms. When a person stops learning or thinks they have it all figured out they become a boomer.
I think people overreact about the employee lockout end. The company will only go up from there, and while SOME employees might take some profits right away, MOST will keep their shares. We are in a bullish market, big things are coming for PLTR, anyone who would sell now would do it out of “necessity” or be silly.
Nah. 5G isn’t going to affect OLED demand. If anything foldables will kill OLED tech. Good luck pawning off your shares on retail though.
Drop every penny on all meme stocks from WSB.  Eating instant noodle for 6 mo
This the fucking truth.
^^🚀🚀🚀
Yes, I'm using Tiger Brokers!
Why would we stop the boomer trash talk? Boomers burned down the economy and skyrocketed house prices,  this is our payback.    We coming for them.
Just think. With the short squeeze you can make *a whole dime* from the increased lending fees. Right? So clearly you'd be a fool for disabling it.
Exactly! I feel “responsible” because my position, for once in my life, doesn’t expire & won’t go to zero in under a month lol 


Holding til August, December, no problem.  As long as I don’t sell, it’s a sure thing.  They are going to bleed out over time.  I am going to enjoy being retarded

Imagine if the GME short squeeze already happened

If the short interest data wasn’t actually updated 

The amount of people in this sub getting margin called
The point is that the squeeze happens when available shares are low. His calls aren’t affecting that number
GUHHH
What program do you use to make these?
800+ shares here
Are you saying the dotcom crash happened because civilisation moved onto smartphones?

If so you're retarded
Absolutely, but not by OP. Either the guy who got his info exposed could sue, or OP could tell uncle Sam and an AG could look at it ("through being idiots you exposed financial data of New York residents. Eat shit or pay us.").

gotcha, so if i sell out of other positions to the point im no longer using any margin, would that mean gme shares i bought on margin are no longer considered margin? or do i have to sell them and rebuy them or something
If GME can pivot to pc, like mini microcenters i’ll be fucking happy! 😈😈😈

i am craving confirmation bias on gme i look at this sub every 10 seconds

Why is tuesday going to be good for PLTR? Whats the news
It seems very probable. Stranger things have happened. At least now I’ve got a better idea of what could truly be driving those moves. In any case I still remain bullish, but my confidence only stretches far enough to predict that the price will almost certainly be higher a month from now. What happens in the meantime is certainly going to be a rollercoaster.

Ouch..
Me too
Yes. It will all go to boomer airlines and shitty green energy plays that will piss it all away. Imagine if the fed went in on printing the tendies to buy GME stock. We could solve the entire national debt thing.
It says 3/25 for me
Say his name, show some respek. u/deepfuckingvalue
Conspiracy theorist!
Entirely fair. I definitely think people are dangerously bullish on it. I am as well, but I pulled out enough profits that I’m playing with profits only now so if it doesn’t work out it doesn’t lose me anything. 

I’m super nervous for people buying in now at >30 thinking it’s a guarantee it’ll squeeze. I’d be lying if I didn’t say I think it will but it’s far from guaranteed and it sounds like a lot of people are gonna learn a painful lesson if it doesn’t.

As you said way above, even if it does work out as a transition it’s not going to be an overnight thing. Brick and mortar doesn’t shift overnight lol.
In the TVs
That's still dumb. The smart and safe play is passive broad-market ETFs.
Completely agree here. My personal feeling is that share prices will either be stable or drop on Tuesday. There hasn't been a catalyst for anything to happen. I've been pricing up, but I think this will be a slow increase. 120 @ 24.12 Shares
+1

Banking on a squeeze on Tuesday or even next week is retarded. It could happen, but I'd be happier myself seeing the squeeze dragging out over months, Tesla style, which is a very possible scenario given the firepower on both sides. 

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I didn't lose money with options. I tried to help. But then I found a ton of people who disagree insulting and being disrespectful when the only thing I wanted is to make people think it twice looking at the big picture
hey i am not puttin it down. its a canadian company. im canadian im all for it. sounds like a unique approach. and price wise looks like u are getting in decently early. just saying they have a ways to go. its risky from an investor standpoint with markets this high so you have to be nimble with this is all im saying. could pump for a few days and dump for years. so keep ur eye on it but dont think itll go up a ton because of this

Still distraught after diamond handing a 3,000% profit TSLA call down to -100% expiration.... only for the same exact strike (but dated a week later) to rocket 40,000% by the following Friday.

2020 was a phenomenon
Nah most of us are in it for the long term, thats why everyone is talking about RC turning the ship around. It will take years but if he succeeds GME could be a 500 dollar + stock in 5-10 years.
Do you know what he said after "I'm giving you the story of a lifetime"?
maybe some ev companies will falter but not tsla.

Hahaha those retards still don't see the value play. Cohen is gonna run out inches to insert in them.
Robinhood is the only one I would actually buy out of the 3
No, this is money I don't intend to touch anytime soon. I have a boring ordinary job that pays the bills. I have most of my investments in broad market passive low fee ETFs. I have a smaller active investing account I trade in using money I can afford to lose.


You can do it for a living if you want. There's no shortage of professional traders out there. But don't jump into it without doing a shitton of studying first. Statistically, unless you are an institutional investor, you're better off long term just buying an index fund. But that's not fun, and you won't get rich quick that way.
I'll choose an analyst's prediction on profitability over the prediction of some random person who has terrible grammar any day of the week.
**[Sudoku](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudoku)**

Sudoku (数独, sūdoku, digit-single) (, , , originally called Number Place) is a logic-based, combinatorial number-placement puzzle. In classic sudoku, the objective is to fill a 9×9 grid with digits so that each column, each row, and each of the nine 3×3 subgrids that compose the grid (also called "boxes", "blocks", or "regions") contain all of the digits from 1 to 9. The puzzle setter provides a partially completed grid, which for a well-posed puzzle has a single solution. Completed games are always an example of a Latin square, including an additional constraint on the contents of individual regions.

The fact is Sernova Corp are the world leaders when it comes to creating a medical device for housing theruputic cells. They are the first company in the world to show their device is effective in treating a disease and the first in the world to help a T1D patient go insulin independent in this manner. 

American competitors have already been purchased by big pharma for 1B USD without showing any results and being pre-clinical. 

It doesn't take a genius to know this company and stock is the real deal
That turned me ON
What most people will do is sell high because of the squeeze and than buy low for long thesis

It's an interesting strategy, and you're right, it could work. I'm not convinced it will, but it could.

Appreciate hearing your thoughts, made me consider a few things I hadn't. I'm now slightly less bearish overall, but still feel bearish long term unless they can demonstrate these transitions are viable.
I thought this was GME. BAN

If you know so much about investing, then you should understand that the stock market is forward looking. If Gamestop continues with their old strategy, then you are right. But Gamestop is not doing that.

Ok like I understand most people here are virgins but you gotta understand we are bags of saltwater that try to fuck, and some people think money catalyzes this but money is just numbers in your trading account.  Think about all the broke dudes banging hotties, leaving them pregnant, and then they look for simps to support them. Like you realize they are all on board with fuckbois that do one thing right - fuck them good, but good dick doesn't pay for diapers. You don't need anything but supreme confidence to get women. There are so many chicks out there wanting peen, and all you have to do is go up to them and say eyo girl what that mouth do, or ask her if she needs someone to check her pipes. It sounds ridiculous but it works. Sure, some girls will be offended, but in my experience when they say "excuse me what did you say" and you say it again very clearly, they will want your dick in their mouth and will be getting railed shortly. You gotta believe.
They haven't made a drug, they've produced a medical device that gets implanted in the abdomen and is about the size and thickness of a credit card. This pouch vascularizes within the body and is injected with whatever theruputic cells you need. In this case it is stem cell derived islet cells which produce insulin. These cells can survive in this "artificial organ" and then help the patient. They have already proven the device is safe in multiple trials. They are in the clinic with diabetes but are very soon going in for a hemophilia & thyroid treatment. Not to mentiom they have multiple immunoprotection technologies as well. 

In the trial they have 5 out of 7 pateints enrolled as the eligibility criteria is pretty strict (have to be severely diabetic) the patient who is insulin independent has been the longest enrolled patient and the only to have received the full dose of islet cells. The others have received a smaller dose so far and have all shown very positive efficacy results. When those other 4 patients recieve a top up of islet cells, we should hopefully see more insulin independent patients
Agreed. Plus that time period includes a global pandemic, which is hurting almost all brick and mortar stores in the short term.

Further, the transformation plan has included roughly 10% of locations where there were too many GameStops nearby. That will decrease topline revenue, but should improve profit margins. Particularly so as they move further into ecomm.

You're not thinking properly, as an investor. You're being irrational
I'm not expert and pretty new at all this but at 7.50 you would of already made some gains cause the stock is higher in APHA now. As long as the 83% of TLRY stock remains higher than what you bought the APHA stock, yes, but stocks are gamble. Who's to say that TLRY will stay that high? Things can change and I suppose technically you could have a loss if TLRY goes down.

It’s pretty hard to buy options or trade in NZ. Easiest is to buy ETFs. American shares are ok to invest in to. If we’re seen to be trading they tax you like your income tax
It must be. It's impossible to get laid.
Sorry, a case of not actually reading the name of the OP. Keep on kicking ass.

I don’t think traditional investing is “buy until we fuck the shorts and force the squeeze then sell”. Or in other words. “Buy and hold for a period of between 1  to 3 months”
Wtf
lol I just am betting history repeats itself
Unfortunately not. I read it here last night, some dude said that big account got this email. Could be big bullshit, that's why I asked again. Google didn't help me

We need an update on WSB GME share holdings. 35k, what a chad.
GME and PLTR time!
You are underperforming LKNCY by 450% 🤡🤡🤡
My account is only a month also and made the same mistakes. I would see red, panic sell and Google quickly the next in stock to invest in. Few panic buys later and kept realising I'm buying on the peak/ramp up and feeling the drop alot more than I was feeling the peak.

Gme is my biggest investment so far 18 shares at $36 I will not be making the same mistake this time around. If I see the dip Tuesday I'll be putting more into it for sure
Worked for one girl a couple weeks back
If markets are so rationale nobody loses money , it’s not based about fundamentals or technicals . All this helps support your judgement , but it doesn’t mean it will move the way you expect. Wake the fuck up
They must know something. More incoming deals for PLUG? Maybe hydrogen is feasible after all? Shame they weren’t 11% in PLUG a month ago before it doubled though 😂
Gme short squeeze is such a rare moment and opportunity. If you have tons of money already, you can cash out after 100% like you said, but if you'd don't. Might as well stay on the rocket to either hit a huge one or fall back to earth.
Same here dude. Started with 1k in November, now at 2.5k and have withdrawn my original 1k. I owe half these gains to one stock. Aiming to keep doing as I’m doing but invest more each time. Hope you get what you want.
oh so you actually are retarded...

Amazon is already trying (and failing hard) to get in the videogame market

Nothing is stopping Sony or Microsoft from doing anything, we are betting on Gamestop to do it first, because they NEED to, they have ANNOUNCED they will and um, Cohen.

The last question shows you're playing a very weak devil's advocate game, what are you, 25? What is this shitty whataboutism? are you here for attention or something?
This wasn't an assignment at all. It was long investors jumping in to tighten the grip. Shorts have actually increased their position!
Got a link?
Esports and gaming is on the rise. If GME becomes the defacto brand to own this, it’s GG. People and the culture in this is rabid. Just like dog owners. Chewy dude knows this. Calls. Looong.
I trade OTC only and I’m up 350%
Never imagined that I'd ever find myself in any line of activity which would make me despise weekends until I began playing the stock market
i smellll a squeeezzeeeee
Stfu markets is irrational at times it happens stop crying that you missed the rocket
That's what I'd do. I'd wait until the market opens to see whether it's going to be a down day. It's possible you could get in at 30... regardless, if you are purchasing shares without margin, I'd say there's not much to worry about as it's a great longer term play
One of us!!! 🚀🚀🚀
Still diamond handing this? Diamond hands on this baby 💎
Is this a copypasta, because otherwise what the fuck 🤡🤡🤡
They bought up all the shares, and fucked the shorts...WSB buying up all the shares and...
Think about this - if the shorts had the control that some think they have, then retail piling into GME would actually secure **larger** profits for them. 

I'm not saying they can't move the market significantly, they can. I'm just not sure they're willing to burn through billions to do it. GME will be a tiny portion of the shorts portfolio.
Personally I would wait for a drop, then get in if that is your intention. All the red will scare folks and some will bail early in the day.

Tell me what's stopping amazon for example, about creating a great video games platform??

Tell me what stops sony and msft about  creating a greag demo program.

Tell me if GME disappeared, what would change for E-sports??
Spare you from what? Your fucking stupidity? I wouldn’t care if that mother fucker died in the process either.
This guy definitely has a fearmongering agenda, check his previous 'alarming' post about massive drop to occur on 15th Jan. This one is the same - a lot of words, unclear conclusion (GME will be volatile, shocking!) but you all better watch out next Friday. Someone is trying to increase the odds of his play, prolly at expense of WSB. 

In fact, nobody knows how this will play out next week. In my view GME short squeeze became a mainstream topic last week whether we like it or not and other institutional players will join the fun and try to fuck each other. I much prefer DD focusing on more upcoming catalyst (ie Cohen's actions) than posts like this.

Also, in contrary to popular belief, I do not think we retards have enough firepower start the actual squeeze. Yes, we got in early, now we're riding the tide but since change of GME management board the game is Cohen (and his wealthy friends) vs shorts. We're just profiting from that fight.

Personally I'm convinced that a successful billionaire taking charge at the beginning of a new console cycle is a much better bet than boomer shorters. This supposedly bankrupt retailer is going unexpectedly strong in time of global pandemic, got new investors/management with actual vision and all I can hear back is blockbuster narrative plus fearmongering bullshit like this post.

Shorts are now trying to delay the inevitable and get favorable price point to unwind. Think, will they wait for console supply constraints to be over or RC releasing his game-changing e-commerce strategy? Rockets have already launched (fucken 130% in 2 days?), now it's time hold my fellow retards. 

To the fucking moon.
Markets seemed very weak Friday into the close.  Fasten your seat belts.
Honestly, I have no idea. If it is a similar day to Friday, buckle up.
Pluto should be the mascot for WSB, it was astronomy's pump and dump
RC needs his own bullet point. You don't just compete with both brick/mortar and **Amazon** then proceed to successfully sell the company for the highest ecommerce sale in all of history and still be in the realm of humans.
I'm depressed I can't make money on monday
"Sleepy Joe" is going to inject 1.9 trillion into the US economy. You really think that's going to result in a sleepy market?
it almost hit $12 before the big sell-off on Friday so assuming people start buying back in / the upward pressure continues i'd be surprised if it doesn't hit $12 ~~again~~ easy

$BB $10c 6/18

Dude you don't need money to bang girls. Broke as dudes bang mad hotties. You just need to go out there and fuck some hoes. I swear, after you fuck a girl they can all smell the pheromones and want to fuck. It's way easier to be banging multiple chicks than to go from 0 to 1 because when you have no chicks your pheromones reek of desperation. When you don't give af, and the girls can smell the pussy juice on your dick (I don't know why but whenever I fuck multiple girls in a day I don't wash the cock in between them because I want them to unknowingly taste the other girl) they super love your dick and it's because of the smell. Women smell things like 10000x better than men. Your bank account doesn't smell. Your job doesn't smell. But the testosterone coming out of your nuts smells and it comes out of you. Now, you can choose to think you need more money to have access to females. But instead, if you decide you are a bag of saltwater trying to penetrate other bags of saltwater and forget about money, then you'll bang these chicks. Girls care about money when they're trying to get married, but if you had money you would just pay to vacation and chill all day while you find some babes. You really need zero dollars to get chicks. A couple years ago I was homeless for like a month and was still banging two chicks. They had no fucking idea, I would just stay at one of their places and keep clothes in the trunk of my car to change in. I didn't give a fuck that I was homeless, I wanted to get my dick wet. A couple years later, I own a house, but I don't go oh I own this I have money. No. I'm pretty sure one chick now thinks I rent my place, and idk about the other. Either way, you don't brag about money to get girls. That's how you attract gold diggers. Women are attracted to confidence, and that comes from within you, not your bank account.

Look, you seem a very reasonable person compared with these truly oligophrenics or 15 y/o lads.

True DD is not about a guy thinking what's gonna be. It's not About hyring promising guys and having hope. It's not about, they're gonna change to digital.

This is like when you're dating a bitch who cheated on you, and you hope she's gonna change.


The common sense tells us the world is not going GME path.

The financials, that never lie (only LK, Wirecard) tell us that this company is dying.

All the indicators are red flags.

Are we gonna invest based on hope of change?? If GME is gonna Make money based on that suposed change, what's stopping big companies with infinite resources like MSFT from eating Game's breakfast??

Don't you see they have no margin??

Don't you see that a WSB retard DD, 99% of the times, means nothing??

That’s a pretty dumb comparison, Porsche was acquiring Volkswagen. Nobody was short squeezing, they were just buying all shares
I think that’s the loss *so far*
Fundamental valuations? Boomer.
For many of us, our bullish attitude stems from Ryan Cohen's vision for GME as presented in his Nov 16th [letter to the GME board](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000101359420000821/rc13da3-111620.pdf).

Some highlights.
> GameStop needs to evolve into a technology company that delights gamers and delivers exceptional digital experiences – not remain a video game retailer that overprioritizes its brick-and-mortar footprint and stumbles around the online ecosystem. 

> Taking the right steps in 2020 and 2021 can enable GameStop to own a bigger share of the market when estimated industry sales explode to more than $200 billion per year in 2023. We contend the Company’s sales should be growing at least in line with the market – not going in the opposite direction. Significantly upgrading e-commerce can provide for greater revenue capture across larger gaming catalogs, digital content and community experiences, online trade-ins, streaming services and Esports.

Cohen has amassed at [12.9% ownership of GME](https://fintel.io/so/us/gme) and as of Jan 11th, Cohen and two of his compatriots [now serve on the GME board](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2021/01/11/2156168/0/en/GameStop-Announces-Additional-Board-Refreshment-to-Accelerate-Transformation.html). I believe this was a large reason for the price increase seeing as Cohen and his team can now work to implement their vision.

I'm certain some GME bulls are just hoping for a large bump in GME price due to a short squeeze, which may very well happen, but for the rest of us, we see long term value in GME dominating the massive and growing gaming market as they transform through Cohen's vision.
it also stands for GenoMics Evolution

You would let go of some if it hits $30 next week anyways right?

If you're planning to hold on PLTR until it's $100, ignore what I said.

E-sports is one of the biggest potential markets currently in existence.

E-sports events are extremely multi-industrial, Gamestop has A LOT of spaces to fit in. 

Amazon is a shitty place to buy videogames unless you already know what you want.

There is actually no proper videogame online seller (of phisical copies) that offers the same depth of search, discovery and comparison of products as something like Steam. There might be a potential market there.

I mean, this market is crazy, and fundamentals don't even matter anymore in many cases. But don't forget many are betting on a huge short squeeze, not GME actually becoming a hugely profitable business in the future. It's a gamble, sure, but this may turn into a success story. Or a Cohen cult or something. 

Only time will tell. Let's check where GME is in a year.
Same. Work for a vet, so hard cuddling the puppies and scared rescues but knowing I shouldn't have one unless I can buy insurance for them
Don’t use margin.

I live in Europe and make like €22k per year. Sad thing is, I'm actually over the country's average salary. I wouldn't be able to live alone though, the rent itself is 2/3 of my monthly salary, thank god we go half and half with my gf. If we broke up I'd have to choose between moving to a smaller appartment (would still cost me half the salary) or to a flatshare again.

This isn’t surprising at all. Dude wants to play both sides of his mouth by saying somehow wsb are the MM and not the billion dollar fund, but then pushes other chicken shit stocks like BBBY to us expecting us to care. The sooner this sub ignores him the better it is.

The fact of the matter is, you could be right. Maybe we have no idea what we're doing. Maybe the short squeeze doesn't happen or maybe all of our warriors are crushed because they got greedy and bought calls instead of shares, but the truth is, we won't listen because we're tired of being wage cucks, and we want to taste what melvin has had all these years. For the first time, it's possibly that we can do that.

Hello my name is Alex Karp 🙋🏻‍♂️ I enjoy long walks on the beach and dumping shares on wsb autists
[deleted]
Why is everyone so convinced that RC is on our side? He's pursuing his own interests. I see two ways for him (if he does anything at all):

1. Release some hype news to drive up the price even more, then use the peak to emit new GME shares and get cheap funding to finance the restructuring and pay off old debt.

2. Do nothing or post some anti hype news, e.g. "we're still figuring it out, don't expect an announcement in the next 3 months" to drive the price back down and buy more shares to get to his 19% target.

I'm just a noob who knows nothing about actual regulations and stuff, so if someone smarter than me could chip in, I'd highly appreciate it. Cause I honestly don't understand what would be his motivation for doing anything other than these two things.
I’m starting to build a VXX shares position. Idk when a correction will happen, but seeing VXX at 30 isn’t unseeable to me at some point in the next year.

Someone posted this but I can't find any links to verify. I hope it's not Karp exercising more options to dump shares again.

Get ready for next week! Karp and Cohen filed for HSC forms (meaning SEC has to grant them permission to purchase shares worth more than $94million). And guess what? They were granted. They also granted them early termination, meaning can purchase these shares in less than 30 days. Starting Tuesday and up until DEMO DAY we will move towards and surpassing all time highs because there will be over $188 million shares being bought. You thought ARK’s $12 million purchase was nice? Wait till this hits!
Same tho, I thought he’s doing this to be fucking with us which is funny af but his comments sounds makes it looks like he’s genuinely sweaty.
If you placed a market buy, then it will buy at whatever the price is at market open. If you placed a limit order, it will wait until someone is selling at your limit price or lower, then it will buy shares. If you placed a limit order and the price steadily increases, it will either cancel the order at the end of day, or keep the order open for 90 days depending on whatever preference you set when you placed the order. If you don't remember choosing an order end date or setting a limit price, then you probably placed a market buy.
I bought my house in the crash and its up 100%
You're the original thot
That golden age is priced in at current valuations. So it better be or some people are going to lose a lot of money on this stock.
Yeah, with 30% of its worth when it was available to everyone. A warning out of nowhere will instantly get you -10% on the dot. Have fun.
It's not even a meme stock, it's crazy undervalued. 1b revenue with a 5b valuation and huge potential with EV and cybersecurity.
Trading from the UK is even better. i have given up on the uk stocks as us market opens at 2:30 pm here and closed at 9pm. plus more price action in the usa
Fortune favors the prepared!
Really, the chemical giant Bayer is supposed to rise cause they sell more Aspirin, something a lot of people are using anyway already?
Bayer might be a long term play if they recover from the Monsanto debacle, but selling blood thinners won't affect such a large company at all. At least that is my impression.
FB is awful Cuck is paying people to shill FB to hope we think it's a meme stock. We make memes about good stocks that go up. If FB wants to be a meme stock they can start with firing cuckerborg. Then, we might make a meme or two.
The things about the channel I just said, as well as the long holders DD's on here that aren't rockets and aren't about the squeeze.

No sub 500m stock talk
I would word this differently.
I am happy about all of that.

But I made this post because some retard said that GME will be a 1 Trillion company in 2030

One thing is to ride the gains while the meme stock is being pumped.

Another thing is ti think this company is gonna go up for the next 3/5/10 years
I wonder if he'll do a buyback at that part of the roller coaster.

Why do you fail to understand Gamestop is moving to digital, which is a huge fucking potential market with one of the hottest CEOs currently? Esports has just started, do you not see the potential there?

Why do you fail to understand that for bulls this is 1000000000% more important than the company's financial profile from 2009? Are you **actually** retarded?

Really recommend you read up basic terms before doing trades. At least know your greeks. One of them is theta, more often known for crushing you by the sack. If you bought options, you have thetha decay, no matter what price or time to expire. Say it’s in the money, doesnt matter. You stilll have theta, it’s just a lot less impactful than if it were out the money. So think of it as time is money, but also taking into factor where your position is vs the current stock price.  Finally, in the last two weeks or so before your contract expires, theta will crush you so hard if your OTM. Meaning, you lose more money every day.
I know. But there are like 50 people insulting me when the only thing I wanted was to share knowledge and enlighten a bit trying to help.

Because I don't want my fellow retards to be burned
Dude west coast trading hours rock. You can get all your trading done before work even starts, market closes at 1 and you have the rest of the day to relax. Waking up early starts to become a habit and your gambling addiction accidentally improves your sleep schedule. Yeah the taxes suck (even with no income tax we still pay some of the highest taxes in the country). Dont live in seattle though man, there are relatively (emphasis on relativity) cheap places if you get out of the city you can buy houses with acres of space for the price of a cramped condo in seattle.

I have the same lifestlye as most people here (and $35K is not even close to all my savings).

I'd actually argue that having $5K is better than having $35K. With $35K, you have to be semi-responsible with your investing strategy. With $5K? You could YOLO at any point and therefore you have the potential to 10x your money on one play.
No, but I do think GME can make money

Would you rather live in a place where your house goes down in value every year? I'm down 30% since 2014 and my losses continue to accelerate. I feel sick about it.
Thank God you didn't short gme.

This loss porn is acceptable!
Like where your head is at, my concern is that there is not enough evidence/literature to causes a massive surge in scrips. 
Pretty sure xarelto sales numbers are projected to drop in the future as others DOAC’s don’t have they scary Black Box Warning 

It’s a joint venture with J&J so I would think Bayer isn’t getting all the benefit. Also lots of generic Aspirin eating into Bayer’s benefits.
Here’s an original thought:
I repeat, do you think tesla disruptive technology has something to do with selling games on a store??

And the only reason this stock went 3x is because all the retards pumped it, and all the wannabe so smart shorted it.

What's going to sustain the price od this company. What do they have that no other company can do?? "

Are we going to a world where more peoptgo to Game Stores or where you buy online or download the games??
Thinking of buying about £500 of BB on open and letting it ride with my ICLN. Thoughts?
Bro relax, this subreddit is a meme, we call each other retards for fun.
What other prophecies you got 🤔
Thats rather Brazen of you.
the meme here is we put 5-20% of our portfolion into literal GME stock. we dont short, we squeeze by buying the shares the hedge funds shorting GME because they made the same analysis you did and did not understood that this is a sound company. and even if people lose some money on minor part of their portfolio, at least they can say they were around when they bankrupted a hedge fund for lolz
why is everyone convinced it will go so high? what are the catalysts?
CGX also is barely profitable. Most money comes from media not movies or concessions.

Been thinking bout this and how large block buys can occur in real time in the market, come through at 4:00:01 pm as MOC orders or trade on dark pools that match a given price during the day. Each has different impacts on price and volume throughout the day AND we should verify which Cohen has used in the past accumulation days to measure how he is likely to participate, as this speaks to the potential magnitude and trigger of squeeze. Personally I thought he was doing this on weds and thurs but lack of filings says not.

So these methods via which RC can buy shares are:

1. market block buys, cause upward price momentum and can create inertia by pulling in retail and scanners in (near) real time. 

2. MOC orders, would be market orders put through right at the market close at the price is closed at. (Can create after hours upwards price runs as its a bullish sign, note if you’re every trading a biotech FDA approval deadline and it’s the day of the decision and no word is out by market close, check historical quotes on nasdaq - big MOC block buys coming through = accumulation, regardless of closing price, which may mean that news leaked (common in small-mid biotech). Did this with $BCRX and it was beautiful, anyway moving on 

3. Dark pool orders,  wouldn’t move price as we would see no changes in volume or price during or after market.

 I’m not a broker so I don’t know,  but does anyone know whether the buyer (RC here) can choose which method to use? Did he use MOC or intraday orders before ? 

Brings me to a related note that all the big block purchases of deep ITM calls on Friday - could that be preparatory covering by a short fund intending to exercise to cover at current pricing of it jumps up? Could mean institutional shorts are building defences
Buy all you can 🚀
Omg don’t buy CGX.

Do you really think, that we degenerates have the power to pump a stock? We owe in the most positive scenarios 1 million stocks. It is nothing compared to the volume that was last week. Even if we buy everything we can make it go like 5% tops. Not mentioning that most of them have options
This is one long ass holiday
Yes plsss
There are a few people investing with more than a million. I know of at least 2 other people with over 2 million in GME.
Rather go negative than make 5%
I don't get this man, if he believed in those things he'd drop a his put positions but nooo, he's just using irrelevant data that had nothing to do with the rise in GME stock.

your analysis is wrong. the company has goodwill with us the customers who grew up with it, has enough cash and good management to transition to digital. they sell collectible products that elsewhere are marked up to the heaven. so yes there is good case for them to be a long play

Pretty great film about how the big banks fucked us with derivative investment vehicles that basically repackaged nightmare junk mortgages into... well, slightly fancier collateralized debt obligations and credit default swaps, mega leveraged to the hilt and then, you know, caused the economy to collapse.

Ok so new to this sub, only been investing for a few months and haven't had much luck with other "groups" and whatnot. Obviously I missed out on the initial hype of this stock. But is it too late to buy any on Tues and still make a profit?
I don’t see the housing prices dropping in Seattle anytime soon. Burien and Renton aren’t too expensive yet, but it’s getting there
And then...?
He’s asking because he wants 7x times the calls
You can move you know, nobody is forcing you to stay bruh. Taxes may be high here, but weather is great all year
I know they're pricey. Now. But literally one year ago... You know what I mean.

Do you think the best companies you can fin IN THE WORLD, not only the states, to make great money, are companies like GME??
short everything iron-related to oblivion -> chinese manufacturing grinds to a halt -> cause chinese recession -> foreign investors sell off their property -> get a crack house in bellevue for cheap

For a very short time, yes. Its not gonna be rational by any means. That doesnt mean we cant make money on it.

I'm sinking another k on Tuesday
We’re winning by 3k, still too small margin though
The whole VW debacle was in a time of economic recession, with the majority shareholder aggressively buying up stock (Porsche), albeit with a much lower SI. It was allegedly intentional, an engineered squeeze. 

GME won't necessarily follow this pattern guys & girls, just strap in 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Did we get a prize?
What path? Are you fighting to see who is more cute? How insecure do you have to be to tell all of us retards you did modeling in Japan and then have two pictures where you hide your face?

You do realize that everything you are saying was available also 6-9 months ago. And your advice would have cost a lot of people  5-10 times gains.

&#x200B;

I don't get why some people are just saying their opinion without even seeing the potential of a company. I bet you wouldn't have invest in TESLA cause who buys electric cars in 2012, right?
The reason is twofold:

1. Most if not all brokers automatically will consider your shares available to be lent for short selling if you're on margin. Since half of the GME DD is about the short squeeze, buying shares on margin doesn't help one bit, since the shares you buy on margin will immediately be turned around and lent to a short seller, negating the "hold shares to take them of the market and prevent shorts from applying selling pressure/having easy covers" approach.
2. Supposedly some brokers are issuing margin calls for GME shares bought on margin... Or at least, so I read somewhere here. I'm not on margin, so I can't confirm that, though you should be able to find the post, as it came in the last two days.

I don't encourage anyone to go all-in on GME. I'm BB gang, since I really believe in them. But I'm also not all-in on them. You should diversify atleast a little bit imo, for example these great companies you say (altough I think they're already quite pricey by now)

I'm in it for the potential rocket, with the squeeze, the RC factor, but also the channel in which I believe and just explained.

If my 150 shares go x2 I will be happy and maybe a little bit sad I didn't have steel balls. But I wont be as sad as when it goes /2 and I lose half of all my money

Yeah sadly I think that might happen if on Tuesday the price doesn’t go over 40. Bought in at 37, currently in the minus and if it goes below 34-33, I’m done for.

Was simply riding the wave, trading it in and out.  Alright bunch of autists, I'll throw in a couple grand for a good cause (fuck the bears and shorties) and hopefully this good karma will pay out nicely down the road.
Au Contraire! 
GME and PLTR are the proof of the underlying and dormant value-seeking that exist around here.
It may be fun and unprofitable to dick around with meme stonks, but once in a while, when real value might be at hand, everybody acknowledges and even takes part.
Look at icln holdings. It’s mostly plug and enph at this point. So do you think those are set for another huge run?
Is that by the guy who wrote shogun and taipan? Got the books, and heard they are great, but haven’t gotten around to them
Imagine the stock market exists with thousands of choices and new ones added everyday and the one you say that this is the play to go in on is GM
😔😔😔😂
Minimum $500, could be thousands!
Have you shorted it, or sitting on puts or something? If not, why care? You want to teach others a lesson or something? If you are confident it will go to shit, I am sure you, being smart and all, can figure out how to profit off of it.
Short time mass short could push price under your margin limit. Then you are out.
Yes, it is for sale (I work in digital marketing). It is a premium domain, so that's why the price is so high. However, you could buy it - it is available.

EDIT: I'd like to add that you could (should?) set up a Go Fund Me where subsribers of WSB have the ability to donate money in order for the mods to purchase the domain. It isn't a bad idea. Look at how many awards people give out here. I'm sure you'll get 10s of thousands of people who would donate at least $1 each; I am one of those people.
This is a rare market event that doesn't happen often. Check out "vw short squeeze" and "kbio short squeeze" to see how it usually goes down. 

This time is a bit unique because the parties holding the float (<-- google this too) are relatively diverse, instead of being concentrated in a few massive holdings. Also, "short interest" is unnaturally high.

It's not guaranteed to happen.
I'm not even sure its that.  Looks like someone wearing something under the pants

Give me your 1/3/5 y predictions

Based on your thinking process
This sub be doing animemes better then r/animemes
* At one point, TSLA looked much worse than this even without a pandemic. 
* GME has survived and performed well compared to many other even larger companies last year, many of which have filed for bankruptcy.
* They are nowhere near the point of bankruptcy and have been making huge (and successful) new transformations which is a trait of a moonshot company.
* Cohen being in the board of directors is absolutely massive. This guy made record by directly competing with both Amazon and brick/mortar stores in the industry, coming out successful and landing the largest ecommerce purchase in all of history. 
* That being said, if Cohen puts his hands on something, it's going to succeed. It might be a week, a month, six months, or even a year, but it'll happen. 

We do appreciate that you don't want people going to the path of Analfarmer2. At the same time, DFV has been warned and called out many times since 2019 for doing exactly this, starting at \~$50k and doubling his portfolio over and over. He's seen GME when it was "dying", he's seen it through March and the pandemic, he's seen the short interests increasing, and now he's at \~$7.5 mil because he didn't listen. He's also still holding.

Helped the depression/anxiety 1000000% why I started. Amazing results.
I think overall will be bearish. Volatile af. GME will be red but I still feel it will short squeeze higher mid week after Biden takes office. SPY will hit $355-$345 before heading towards $400. TSLA will be flat all week and run up next week before earnings.

Dont get me wrong I'm weak for thots like this 😈
Well a true bull credit spread is buy a call then then sell one at a higher strike but same expiration. So you have a max profit and loss defined by the difference between the strikes and the premium you paid for the spread 

There’s also calendar spreads where you buy a long dated call and sell a short dated call at the same strike. 

I love investopedia for details on things like this
I think Apple is actually fair value, but the others are bullshit especially facebook. If you wanted a safe portfolio, I would call it BAG - BlackBerry, Apple, Gamestop - and let those tendies run.

It's already on my watchlist. I'll probably add in more if it actually goes up.
I’m stressing out, I bought 2 shares at 10.54.
So I hear a lot about a short squeeze next week. Are shorts not sold every week, do we know a lot of shorts expire nest week or is it just speculation there will be a short squeeze next week?
TL;DR : set your shares to limit sell at $420 and watch this motherfucker blast off.

Anyway, 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀.
OTM calls are usually really cheap and if the stock price goes full retard strength you can print pretty hard. $BB was trading under $5/share for most of 2020 but peaked at $11.31/share start of day 1/15. So if you bought, say, a 9c 1/15 back in December it would have been "OTM" at the time of purchase but fucking printed come Friday AM.

I bought calls on Thursday AM for 8.5, 9 and 10 on various dates as I could afford and doubled my portfolio value in a little over 24hrs from the time I purchased the contracts to the time I sold them Friday AM. 

also they're just cheap, like my 8.5c 1/15 I had on BB was $23 when I purchased it on 1/14 but I sold that one for $230 on the morning of 1/15 before the prices dropped too far

It was about damn time.
TLDR ,

Buy GME
I'm all for the true retardation of buying calls on margin in the hope of tendies, but there needs to be  a balance, buying shares will actually drive the price. This just gives mm's a reason to kill the stock and collect the premium.
Using blood thinners to decrease clotting in Covid was a hypothesis postulated early in the disease and many did use blood thinners, but the trials were negative. https://www.nih.gov/news-events/news-releases/nih-activ-trial-blood-thinners-pauses-enrollment-critically-ill-covid-19-patients
I can't think of any direct competitors.  Maybe Best Buy, but I doubt it would be affected by this.  Hobby Lobby, but they shut down and aren't publicly traded anyway.  


Other than that, I can't think of anything other than other highly shorted stocks.  If GME squeezes, maybe short sellers will get spooked on high cash flow companies that WSB might take a look at next.  BB is already being floated.  FIZZ at 63% SI has decent operating cash flow.  But, I don't have a good crystal ball..

If you think something will go down you can sell shares you don’t own (borrow them from your broker) at a high price and then buy them back (to repay your broker) at a lower price once the stock goes down. If it goes up too much you r fuk because this is an unlimited risk strategy.
I'm not denying it could go higher. I'm saying that mid term this company has no future
They realized Dorsey fucked Twitter and Cuck Cucked Facebook so they want us to meme them. But the thing is, as non lucrative reselling games is, Facebook and Twitter sell your info to advertisers, which is a super lame business model. They don't offer anything, and I believe both will die like Myspace. Facebook is lucky to have Instagram that people use more but it's still dumb af. I just use reddit because I only have friends on wallstreetbets and I don't know anybody but we're in this as a team to make tendies. We're not competing against eachother, it is a game of survival and growth and spreading positivity. And also fucking the gay ass bears with big green dildos.

The experience you got from investing, reading DD’s and following trends is worth the 4k. 4k is a small amount to lose in this sub, keep your head up king. We all will recoup.
So in summary, we might only get one squeeze that might take a bit of time and it might not be an unlimited height squeeze cause brokers are limiting new margin trades?

Evaluations have been inherently a lot more inflated since the dot-com bubble naturally and even moreso with the introduction of retail investing, but the entire game when we're on a bull run is that we all COLLECTIVELY disregard old-school fundamentals and play each for who can get in first based on market creation/entry and disruption potential. In bear markets, you could say then financials make a bit more sense, since your risk profile HAS to go down to keep your money churning until the NEXT bull market comes. Everyone's new standard is growth. Value is dead and has been so for a while, and for failing undervalued company, turnaround in operating model might as well be growth. You fucking bears don't have to condescendingly explain this to us every other minute. We CHOOSE to buy the roller coaster ticket you homos. Have fun awkwardly waiting for us at the exit to clean the puke off our faces.

These kind of results are pretty hard to ignore for big pharma. Put it on your watch list and let me know next week what you think

Look at the ass on this chick.
Do you really think I would like to buy shares from a shitty company like GME that the only reason to skyrocket is because some of y'all pumped it, and other smart asses shorted the stock because they thought they were smarter than Reddit??


They have been fucked now.

You will be fucked later.

Now, I will watch with popcorn. Before that, I only wanted to make you think it twice to not lose money
First and foremost a disclaimer. Im pretty sure that I'm not quite 3 full fiscal quarters out from my first stock purchase;  I havent done the work and don't have the wisdom to be anyone's designated driver. What i have at play in the market isnt small to me, but if everything shit the bed tomorrow, I could shake it off. It's easier to fall from shorter heights.
Ban
whats the reasoning behind not using margin?
rolf. When the forum of autism has r/iamverysmart material. Yes, you are smart.
We all going to have to start skipping out $20 Wendy's chicken combos and buy everytime it dips
Tldr; stonks only go up?
So your point is that Ryan Cohen is a stupid fucktard who invested in gme without a good reason, am I right?
[removed]
Yes but nothing will happen
If it doesn't act right then dump your contract ASAP. Especially with a shorter trading week, if it's blood red on Tuesday then get the fuck out while you still have some value, rather than letting it expire worthless. If BB tanks Tuesday AM then get the fuck out. Watch pre-market movements, queue up the sale of your contract before the market even opens and hope it sells to some sucker before the price fixes.

Oh and then buy shares with the proceeds from the sale, because even at $9 BB is undervalued. Even smart people think so, and if it tanks tuesday morning that just means you can afford more shares. Then ride it on up. Worst case scenario you have to be patient to make your money off of it, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

full disclaimer, i'm retarded.
dam are yall goin all in on every trade
14 - every stock trader on the planet is watching it like a hawk and the slightest bit of momentum could launch it so fast that it tears a hole through the fabric a space and time and opens a portal to another dimension.

Note: i'm not currently holding shares, but might put in an order for tuesday.
Liquidate BB sure but don’t drop PLTR hold that motherfucker till you retire.  Hell, pass it on to your kids when you die. That’s how bullish I am on PLTR.
As nicely written as this is, you don't show that Avril Haynes has any connection to PLTR. Sure the CIA invested in PLTR... seven years before she got there. Why would you think she's going to keep increasing their reliance on private systems rather than building in-house versions? 

Unless this whole story was about how she's the perfect soulmate to trained philosopher tai chi enthusiast mountain skiier Alexander M Karp, and how their inevitable affair will give rise to the first galactic surveillance empire.
I’m pretty sure that exactly what’s going to happen. His name is RC.
Very scared my broker will crash
Hello my name is Alex Karp 🙋🏻‍♂️ I enjoy long walks on the beach and dumping shares on wsb autists
he is probably 39 or something

While shareholders thought GME was dead, people don't. They still have a lot of open stores, in which they sell games, accessories, collectibles and consoles.If rumors are correct they will extend this to PC components and PC building stations.

So basically they are a channel, and if we can believe the rumors they will become THE channel for everything to do with gaming.

Rockstar or EA could sell their games directly to you, just as I can buy Nike shoes directly from their site. But I can buy them at stores too, just as you will be able to buy at GME stores too. (both physical and online stores)

I too have a little bit of an afraid bear in me, but I believe in the story so I'm for an amount I'm willing to risk.
Look at your profile picture.😂😂😂
Market is really fucked up being bullish all week and really red on Friday before a 3 day weekend.

Never said you didn’t earn that, seems like you did but having to work for something doesn’t entitle you to call someone complacent or anything else simply because they haven’t done the same thing yet. No one wants to be poor, sometimes you just don’t have many opportunities. 

Sounds like this dude is doing what he can in his situation and calling him complacent knowing what you knew then made you out to be a dick looking down on someone for struggling.
It's still a pennystock, if they don't get attention, it's GG. Things can always go sideways.
people who are holding short positions. google "short sale". Don't hesitate to ask if there's anything you don't understand.
right!
Whut
Yeah I think so
Eeeexactly. It’s basically a value stock. :) The short bubble is what makes it attractive to WSB. It’s a perfect marriage.
VW’s 12.8% is GME’s ~100% (can find the most recent number maybe 103??)

GME is shorted more than VW was. 

VW’s had less share holders though. 

Every share shorted is a loaned share.
Reading through the comments makes me think am I truly autistic for having 4000 shares.

They cannot dip Tuesday price can only go up
Apologies, so just do a normal order? I've got one in to go at open anyway just make sure I've got the capital to see it goes through.
You really cant read at all. Im the one that said to ban you, not the other guy. Then again, we know english is not your first language, so we understand why the ban comment went over your smooth brain.
This one definitely hit a sweet spot, but what if it takes 2 weeks for the onset of symptoms? Nothing would prevent it from spreading
^^🚀 🚀
Good enough to me, I'm in
blah blah blah blah Facebook blah blah blah go up
Because it does after every democratic president and is constantly ruined by america's short term memory and a new red menace?
Problem is you think GameStop will keep focusing selling games. They will shift focus to hardware and accessories. Micro centers remain inaccessible for a lot of people who customize gaming PCs and the GameStop eating into this market would be very attractive to PC gamers considering GameStop’s footprint across the country
Honestly doesn’t seem like there is one yet ✨
Ok I’m in. Will buy a tons of shares on Tuesday.

fuk until early feb
Not OP but

1. yeah it was disclosed in the s-1 but optimistic spins make it seem like that jump will be at least partially sustained, which is dubious

4/5. In the short-term it doesn't matter whatsoever but long-term that is bad bad news for anything dealing with lots of children. One big security leak (particularly with sensitive info pertaining to kids) would be catastrophic

9. I'd argue Roblox should be in a much greater position to be profitable. Gaming companies as a whole don't have any issues with profitability except for... the one that's been around a long time with massive revenue/user base? Judging by what they pay devs it seems like they want to be a tech company, when frankly gaming companies are more like movie studios, where profitability is paramount.

Just seems like once VC money runs dry and corona abates the music might stop. That said I think the stock will experience at least a temporary IPO boom.
5 (pending) shares reporting in.

If you're actually going to, buy it at mid 50s or 60. It's high right now
Anything further back than the last year is irrelevant. It was the end of a console cycle and management has been making significant changes to the financial situation even before Cohen joined up. They already stated this quarter will be profitable. With the new cycle just starting, they have lots of time to revamp the company.
I see nearly every stock take a dip within the first hour in my limited experience. Market open Tuesday prob gunna be fucking wild
Bad idea, volatility will whip you out
Yes
tesla is more than a car company. they will soo have tesla insurance and in 10 years time will have 30% of ev market share when all cars wil be ev. they also do solar and batteries.

well poised to dominate.

3 years time they will be 2500
50 because i sold 100 lol. I am too diversified, gonna buy more PLTR and also BB on tuesday. 
In CRSR too
What happens to the stock after a buyout
New here, what are shorts?
Dont get married. It’s a scam
Imma add nothing to the pot with my measly 27

Last time i got really fucked up I sold 4k worth of gamestop puts
It sucks to be trading for like decades and seeing everything, then comes a day you dip your hands in something you don’t fully understand to go against a bunch of retards, only to end up losing big time.
[removed]
U R FUK
The company has a market cap 1/3rd of its revenue. I’d say it’s undervalued at this moment. If they can even spin the narrative on themselves a little bit then it could go to 150 believe it or not.
It’s my top compounder stock already. ER will be blow the expectations imo. 
And ofc it’s not all about the fundemantals. It’s also about the management ( which didn’t change ) and also about serious news about the company ( which are not as bad as you 🐑 think )
The higher the mortality rate, the less likely it is to spread. I think this one hit the sweet spot.
If he's black check it out yourself or the cops will probably choke him to death.

If he's white, just call the cops for suspicious activity.

If he's mexican stay far away and pretend u didn't see shit.

If he's Chinese ask him where Jack Ma is bro
Serious question: Why would consumers buy from GameStop instead of Amazon?
Wait , you are all doing research?
Nobody is going to have that answer for you. Check pre market and set a limit buy and hope for a dip.

Safe but boring. Memes aside though if that's your risk tolerance, that's your risk tolerance. Completely understandable to not want to risk lighting your money on fire, even if loss porn is great for the memes.

I've used advice from WSB to make completely retarded plays that paid out big as well as making much safer plays that paid out modest amounts. Also lost my fair share of money but that's all part of it. 

If you're patient and in it to actually make money, longer dated near the money / in the money options are a great way to do it.

But of course making retarded plays and watching them print gets the dick hard, so there's that.

11k shares in cash this Tuesday..let's go Boyz
Ignore the political stuff, it will just stir you up because there's more fiction than reality in there. They make money off ads and have an interest in republishing some weird stuff. Their financial coverage, although always on the bearish side, has got a lot more gravitas.
Will I ever get married
They sell fucking games. They're an intermediary.

Don't you think companies like SNE MSFT, TTWO, ATVI... Can make a business plan to share the cake only between them??

Think about it for one second. What is stopping Rockstar or EA from selling their games and sending them to you.

What's stopping MSFT or Sony from giving you the possibility of downloading the game and having 100% of the revenue.

What's the moat that keeps GME being necessary on the gaming industry??

Sounds like you're kind of salty man, don't worry. I have the next short squeeze lined up and as soon as the boys are done taking care of melvin, I'll tell you first so you can get a good price.
I see you are a man of culture as well.
CRSR🚀🏝️🏦
Because fuck Jeff Bezos. I buy new shit at BestBuy and used shit at GameStop. Sometimes I check both places because one might have new shit on sale at one or the other. They let you try out the games at both, but GameStop at least offers to knock off $5 on a game when you trade in an old one. Didn't you ever buy games as a kid? Don't you want a future where GameStop is lit and you can buy games not at fucking walmart or target? Fuck Amazon and Bezos, power to the players. RC made a bag selling dog treats, shit nobody needs. You think he can't sell games? i was long GME for years and dumped when Sherman came on board. After the recent changes, I was happy to get back in at the higher price because the company has hope and a new direction. It will take time, but Sherman was only in it for raiding since P/B was so low and quick ratio was good, but RC says it's not about selling off everything at a slight profit, it's about growing the business from the resources we already have.
Why is the short interest so crazily high for FUBO?
Exactly. Exit and re-entry strategies.
[deleted]
Last couple of sessions 40 has been a hard resistance, so if you set your buy order here it's possible you could get screwed. Better to watch the market and ensure it stays above 40 and then buy in imo. If it does I think it will rocket to 50 quickly...

Yes. Let's say you miss selling during the squeeze. This is still a value play. If Cohen manages to turn GME around there still is huge upside from current levels. It can definitely be a 100-150 dollar stock in the coming years.
I'm not downplaying it. It obviously had a negative effect on the economy. My point was that a hypothetical future virus could be much worse than this one. Imagine one that's as contagious as this one, but has the mortality rate of ebola. No grocery stores would be open, and the military would need to distribute essentials. Use your imagination. 
And I know many victims, including myself and my grandmother who is immunosuppressed due to having skin cancer, as well as being obese and having type 2 diabetes.
Dude I live in germany and they take 40-45% of my salary every month :/ %25 capital gain tax as well

He went all in on $ROPE
The latest funding round, at $45 a share, valued Roblox at $29.5 billion! 

I’ll pass.
Its trading at $1.24 CAD. Based on the valuation of american competitors (who by the way have not been able to produce any positive results, let alone cure diabetes in a patient) at 1 billion, you could expect about 5x the current price
Considering what he has held through so far, he's extremely likely to still be in.
I don’t think it’ll get anywhere near $100, that’s just a meme. Hopefully we can see $50-60, but who knows and who knows for how long. 



But I’m just a normal retard so am don’t trust me, maybe it’ll fucking hit triple digits but I personally doubt it

You could say that kinda stuff about a lot of value stocks man. Numbers and on paper stuff is not everything. 

There’s a lot of other factors you must take into consideration. You can’t ignore public perception, social media events (Elon telling everyone to download signal and remove WhatsApp), etc etc 

Goodluck tho 👍🏾
I can't believe y'all are seriously trying to meme BB. Why don't yall ever pick a good company?

Only the paper hands panic sell.
I love pltr and have traded them on the dips in my margin account and I believe in the company. they are ahead of their time and  the market cap does not justify current revenue and new project wins. don't get sucked in thinking this is going to double and from here in the next month. like plug/gme
Except the negative spaces should also form a rocket

Why shouldn’t you use leverage or margin?
I get what you're saying. But that needs to have an exit plan.

If you're caught on the middle of your plan you'll be fucked.

It's not that I think you can't make money out of this company. I think that it's not sustainable. And sooner or later we will have a tanking stock. That's all
Because the rest of the world wouldnt view us as clowns for having a mango shaped president and therefore dollar go up?

Dude, .5% off ATH is basically at ATH. It literally was at ATH this week.
What makes you say that?
I agree.  They aren't stupid.  I just hope management is feeling a little bitter about having to pay higher borrowing costs for years, despite their cash flow, and aims to make the market pay for their continued shorting.    


On the other hand, management, before this transition to the Cohen model has been mostly scattershot.  Buying AT&T stores, game development, etc.  They missed the one big opportunity staring them in the face.  Which was competing with Steam, or alternatively, transitioning to a complete game store that competes with the local hobby shop with the magic card tournaments, selling board games, etc.  


In any case, long at this price.  1,000 shares average at about $15, bought another 200 at 35 on Friday.
I’m down a whopping 1k off BB but the game god told me keep Faith 🪐
I don't know all of these cases, but Kodak management did not want to go digital. They kept on trying to own the analog market share and giving discounts and incentives to keep going analog. 

Management made the wrong decision, it's not that it was impossible to do the transition.
Boomers like these don’t sell naked calls, that’s the most retarded move in the book

Now you know why we are calling us retarded.

You missed Overstock which went up 2350% from march to august 2020, except there's no way I'd sell at 22x prolly haha. He'd have to guess the top.
Hmm the ending fell flat: a trader who has shorted stock can lose much more than 100% of their original investment!
Yeah it fucks with your head. For most of my life my inability to truly appreciate the value of money has been a negative. But sometimes it's a plus! Like playing with RH monopoly money. I always just figured "spend less nah I just have to make more" and it's worked out for me since college...

Really hard to train yourself not to think "Down $10k today fuck me that's like a down payment on a new truck" or "that's an AirBnB cliffside mansion for a weekend" or even "That's 2 months post-tax salary." But you gotta do it to get that retard money.

What if the publicity from Cramer, Mad Money and other sources has some other whales like pharmabro stalking GME... Waiting like sharks for the perfect time to hop in and buy up 10 million shares or something ridiculous...and setting up the final squeeze from $40-$4200.69 that we've all been waiting for.

Once again, do not engage.
keep 25k to day trade invest the rest in your long term account so you don't lose it. Buy PLTR or Nio shares
Ehhh I know the guy did his I had a dream speach but for the rest... not that much. US history is pretty boring outside of the civil war and you guys helping out in WW2. Beyond that it is mainly you guys fucking up some foreign countries, internal strife, Bill Clinton getting blowjobs and that kind if shit. 

I kind of like history but if it isn't about proper wars, atrocities or empire building it is rather boring

Tanks 10% from when? Right now? After a week that ended +80%?

Or ‘tanks’ 10% from where we started the week at $19?

Or maybe ‘tanks’ from where the OG’s got in at $4 a few months ago?

Stfu and by some GME shares. It’s more fun to be in the rocket.
please, elon doesn't even enjoy it, youre doing it to yourself now
It’s cheap in every valuation model and analysts ratings. Rock solid BS, low af TA to TD, solid revenue growth,double digit ebidta growth, still has huge revenue potential from instagram ( not mentioning whatsapp for now ). 
FB aint going nowhere, go to sleep man, stop being a 🐑.
If you got margin called, you would have to deposit enough money or sell enough shares to bring you back under the margin requirements.
You don't own the shares when you sell a naked call. If he waited until expiration he would have to go purchase shares at @35ish to then turnaround and sell them @20.
Shills gone.
VIX has been over 20 since Feb, so of course things will behave nonsensically.
APE.TOGETHER.STRONG.
GME wouldn't necessarily have to use all of their own money, they could raise capital from investors and quickly get a leg-up on revamping their digital offerings. Will this happen? Doubtful, and even if it did happen it wouldn't be anytime soon.
*yawn* feeling like sleepy Joe rn. Night all
I hear that. Lately I've been having these crazy vivid flashbacks to moments of socialization. Getting ready to go out, making plans, the excitement of seeing people in person. The way places sounded and smelled. The feeling of hugging a friend. The taste of that weird ginger beer I ordered by mistake.

I think I've been doing pretty okay relative to circumstances -- keeping a job, building up platonic and romantic connections, improving some skills over the past year. But I'm still taking a clear hit to my mental health. This has gone on so long.
Bullish
I'll buy 100 shares for shits and giggles.

Metrics are half. But for y'all the other half is autism. Nothing substantial.
For a large institution, whenever they decide it isn't worth holding any more. They aren't going to get a margin call like a retail investor.

Thanks for taking time out of your day to look and comment on my picture. Im glad your world is that small.
im expecting a large gap down this week then
So, even if there's a massive squeeze and the price jumps to $400+, the shorters could just double down on shorts and force the price to drop back down without having to actually close their shorts? Is this a possible explanation for why they keep doubling down? Even if the WSB short-squeeze theory is correct and the price moons like crazy, the shorters could just keep shorting and avoid being forced to cover? Sorry for all the questions. I'm nervous at the fact that shorters keep doubling down. It makes me think they know something we don't. It would make me a lot more comfortable if there's a reasonable possibility that they are just banking on the SEC not cracking down. They're already in too deep, and this is their only hope of getting out. Does that seem like a reasonable conclusion?

Stop looking at the past. It’s a completely different company as of 1 week ago.

While all of these things are true, GME stock price also has been tanking since 2015. Peak 2015 it was at about 45$, in 2020 it got to 4$. It was priced at dying.

So GME is a dying business. But because of the size of the company it takes a while to die. But, and here's the kicker, they aren't planning on dying and with RC joining they've made that well known. But even before RC; saying you're gonna focus more on online and then have a 300% increase in online sales is quite successful imo.

Stocks are priced at future value, not? Well, instead of the future being 0, it got a whole lot brighter.

Well going up 60% in the last hour of trading (when the announcement was made) was certainly verifiable. A huge gap up is coming Monday
check it out chief
Rog just wanted to confirm bear's make deals that revolve around failure and bulls make deals that count on growth
GME shares
People will react exactly the same. Some will take it seriously, idiots like you will downplay because they don’t know any victims personally. The repercussions would be exactly the same.

Nice shout ON gets my vote. I’m in at $36 will wait for small dip but looks decent. I’m also in big on GME this week so it needs to wait it’s turn   Well done my friend ✌️
FB is actually a really undervalued stock.
i bought 28k tesla stock today
Depends on how sneaky you can be
If you hear about a rape you describe the exact time and what you saw to the police
probably because he's a retard who couldn't figure out how to turn BB into tendies like anybody with half a brain
If we ban you, you won't be able to repost. I know you can't read, but shit man.
never said you were short, the reason I and many others is the potential short squeeze. Best case 10x worst case probably .5x or some shit. No clue what they are doing with the company with Cohen. No one here cares about the profitability of gamestop because the moment this thing squeezes we out

You are right, but what you have to understand is, that somebody priced in complete bancruptcy last year, still hasn't paid off their bet, and bacruptcy will **not** happen in the next 3 years.   
Based on revenue we are around a fair valuation right now. It just does not feel like it, because GME was sold down so far last year. Those 70million short positions (I'm told Ortega is reporting more by now) did not pile on around $35, but below $20. If you told me that GME should be below $20 in three or four years I would agree. But I do not beliefe that the shorts will hold that long piling on borrowing fees/bleeding theta.
guys at my apartment where i live its 3 AM and this car drove down the street and a large guy got out in this black long leather coat and just walked up and down the street next to me (i can see through my wooded back yard) when i stepped out for a smoke. im armed, should i check out what hes up to??? if i hear about a rape tomorrow i dont want this on my conscious
Sleepy Joe is going to kill the market. We will only have GME, BB, and PLTR for the next 4 years
Fuck that guy man, I absolutely agree. At 12m "low" yield is actually pretty damn high gains (certainly more than I'm making now or maybe ever ) and it is less risky
hell yeah let's fucking go!
For sure, real estate is the other major wealth store, but it's also bogged down by the state of commercial RE and short term rental market.

RE is more restricted by fundamentals than stocks in my opinion. That's not to say the RE market will perform badly, I'm sure it will do well for the same reasons as stocks. But I don't think it will pull a bunch of capital from equities.
The dude should be smoking one of these rockets or something

I said that is not the same. Tesla is growing. Is the future. Has a moat. Competitive advantage. A fucking genius in charge.

GME sells video games in an industry where you're gonna finish downloading or buying in Amazon.

Or even... What stops another company for selling video games?? What's GME competitive advantage?? What's their moat??
Yup. Set multiple limit sells at various prices to “leg out”

RC can't sell shares at the moment, but if he happened to have bought 100m worth of calls, I believe (any SEC need who knows otherwise feel free to correct) he could sell those. 

It would also send a clear message to not very against him.
then a correcting in feb march

Whether you belong to the 'Bull' or 'Bear' camp, you can certainly be wrong.  Timing the market is truly a fools game.  If the dollar goes lower by another percent, I think SPY at $400 may come soon.
I’m going to set a limit sell of $420 and wait for my notification EZklap

‘How Apple Could Become Tesla’s Much Needed Competitor - Key to Apple’s up and coming innovation is Microvision LIDAR’

MicroVision recently announced that it has restructured its financing and, not only is it debt-free, it has no covenants holding it back from making a deal.

If Apple starts seeing the sustainable value in the company, it may be acquired relatively soon. 

After all, the company has absolutely no debt, making it more appealing to a suiting buyer, should that be Apple or Microsoft, or Tesla.

Either Apple will introduce a partnership or a buyout.

You guys think Q4 earnings are going to disappoint?

The guidance was suspended, yet they said they will probably be profitable without any unforeseen covid affects. 

I feel like the covid disclaimer shouldn’t apply anymore as Biden has basically taken anymore lockdowns off the table and moved on more stimulus. 

I think Q4 earnings is going to be great. 

You’ve been watch a lot longer than me, so I could definitely be missing the perspective here.

Guys, this is a quality DD, whether or not you believe that stonks only go up, this insight is really helpful for investors.

this is usually true because the dollar usually inverses inflation, and inflation is correlated with stocks.

But during black swan/crazy times like the 08 financial crash and the 2018 china scare both the dollar + equities fall.

We going to SPY 600 son 🐂💪💪💪
the shares of GME also do not represent the metrics of today or yesterday but they represent the future and the enormous potential behind it. Tesla is not worth what it is reflecting in the shares, but the Idea and Future(maybe. This is a Casino, idfk)
How Many Cars did they Sold? 500k?

No

This is the way 🚀🌚.
Buy anything at GameStop because the markets are closed
Inverse WSB always $SPY 400c
It's the only stock I kept over the weekend. Cost-basis 31.80, buying flat shares for easy headmath.

While I don't believe "guaranteed" works in the stock market.

To me looks like a rider with RC.
to be fair fb been going down since september lol
Maybe after 50 years, but for the first few decades there will be many EV manufacturers starting up, sky rocketing, then crashing into nonexistence. Just like the early 1900’s, many well established carriage makers tried to transition, some did, some didnt.
THIS IS ONE OF THE DUMBEST POSTS I HAVE SEEN IN WSB.

AND THIS IS WSB WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.
Why?? Under what?? What's the pretext?? I hurt ylur feelings?? I have a different opinion than you?? How old are you?? 15 or what??
The only problem I hear now being thrown around is that in order to surpass these short attacks is to have a huge new surplus of buying at specific times. This may be a difficult game and a bumpy ride
I got BB!!! The Bubble emboldens me to take on more risk than I’m can handle on this play.

💎✋ we will persevere any storm
Okay so I am newer to options trading and just trying to learn all I can about GME. I am a believe in the long play and was curious why if I believed prices were to go up that I wouldn't just do options calls vs buying stock. With options calls my money invested can have a higher impact/return.

Correct? I realize this may be a very ignorant question, I'm trying!!!
[removed]
Cash. Out. Or start investing
Sorry I'm rarted. Say GME goes to a conservative $50, with 22 shares at a cost of $35 thats $330 up is that correct?
Cashh out tendies
what is a good buy for tomorrow?
Dang. Now I understand how people can retire off of 1mil.

No wonder why some people on this sub are considered retarded for not taking out at least some money out of that risky stock/option. That's crazy. 😨

Weekend dow not looking so hot.
Lol let me help you out.

A better analogy would be, Microsoft Azure knowingly hosting Parler or any other site being used to plan domestic violence. If they don't take action after being made aware, than yes. They should be held accountable.

But this takes it one step further. They are curating this data for highly questionable actors. With 0 oversight or transparency. Certainly this is highly suspect where they operate overseas under different laws.

In some scenarios, they are effectively loading the gun and pointing you in the direction of a target. They just aren't making the call to shoot.

So after the past few weeks, idk about you, but I dont particularly trust my government or military or police agencies with diddly shit at this point, let alone some company beholden to shareholders that operates in the shadows.

Who watches the watchers?
Serious question, I'm not in yet, but am in the UK and itching to get in on this. Should I just put a limit order in and use pre market to guess what I'll buy at I feel setting it around $40 would be best as I don't want to miss out.
How much are you up?
I DISAGREE.  HARD TO IMAGINE WE'LL BE FLAT HEADING INTO AND AFTER INAUGURATION DAY..
lmao thats like asking when is the moon gonna fall
I am not a bear. I'm bullish in the market. But at least I use my brain. You are gonna be the first I am going to reply when the stock tanks 10%
I hit 100k in my account, should I cash out? Its the number i told myself I would, but now 200k seems really nice..

Ok, you laid out a good case. But in this market, down is up and we know you don't need earnings to make a stock go up, you just need memes, belief, and big dick energy. You think selling 500,000 cars means you're worth 800B? Fuck no. But if you believe in the company and the memes, your dreams.will come true. If you read the numbers and try to quantify things like a boomer, then you'll make your 5% each year and rave about how it's better than inflation.
If there is a dip you can bet your ass I’m buying it

Is it baseball-bat sized?  Might have been an honest mistake.
The stock crashed so low that they had to do a reverse split to stay listed. Just about everyone who had calls prior to that period lost everything.

This was a 12:1 split so current price is still under the $1/share mark prior to the split.
post needs more rockets.
Like one that has a higher mortality rate then under 1%, and where working aged people are actually afraid of dying. Not saying the current one isn't devastating - it is, just that it could've been much worse.
Then debit spreads
True  but I'd prefer they don't look like shit
You know, you retards are giggling to yourselves memeing FB rn but dumbass lurkers will actually go out and blow up their accounts on FB weeklies after seeing this.. 


I love it 🤣
I’d love if I got paid by Gamestop, I’d just buy more GME.
Yeah but Tuesday it will
Yeah sharp drop sharp increase
Jeff Pesos is gonna announce 100:1 reverse split 🤡🤡🤡
As much as I love this I don't think he is buying at this price.

The metrics on the present are shit too. This company is unprofitable.

And its not a new company growing like Tesla or Palantir.

On the contrary is a dying company
It’s not a recent thing, CNBC, Cramer, and the media has had their attention on this sub long before this GME play, and it’ll happen again when we crowd in on future plays.

But we still have to remember that most of the media are in the pockets of big funds.
Amazon fair value $3600. If amazon pops off. My calls will take me to Valhalla 
Same with apple next week $150, EOW
RemindMe!  1 week "Tattoo"
This is true but this also means wednesday might be another down 10% or more if they get to manipulate the stock price as soon as sec201 falls off. A lot of options expiring again next friday.
More than likely we are. That 10% dip we had on Friday is nowhere  that chasm that followed the initial run up.
Enjoy staying poor

Because they don’t understand how RH works.  

RH makes its money by providing aggregate data on orders to the MMs and HFTs so they can frontrun retail and make money on the difference between your order and the next buyer/seller.

Your data is RHs product.  When you set ridiculously high limit orders, it doesn’t stop RH from loaning your shares.  It lets the MMs see that these orders are in place and act accordingly.  The only way to prevent your shares being lent on RH is to go cash.

What do you mean zeroing calls?
I’m not mad at 2x-3x, but if I have 20 shares at $36. Sounds like I need to up my stake significantly. I get I’m coming late but some are making this out to be the rocket of the decade, which 3x just isn’t. Maybe I  worded it poorly, I’m just trying to decide how deep to go in on this, like everyone I’m sure
Yeah those were fun times, that and soybean/lumber futures lol, you can trade them on TOS by the way.
Facebook is literally MySpace. I signed on for the first time in probably a year and it had no engagement other than a couple boomers complaining
Buying a stock just because of a dividend is whack.  That being said, have any of you had any luck farming dividends by timing the month you own and sell them?
you know we have a situation where metrics don't reflect everything the future can bring. Papa Cohen for example. He will bring glory and tendies. Fuck the metrics of the past.🚀💎🙏

FB to start manufacturing electric cars in virtual reality via subsidiary Oculus.

Its not really complacency - Its having zero funds to move and theres no jobs in my area. Ive been saving all I can and paying off debts (debt free now) I love my job indusrty, its just low paying in general no matter where I go. I would require a whole new transition in a completely new industry and again - kind of lack funds to do any of it including back to school working 70hrs a week right now - I need the ovetime so take it when I can. Having GME take off would give me a huge leg up to being able to not have to NEED overtime and maybe I can work on schooling then next until I am ready to fully leave for better. A lot is riding on this not just for the short term- I have long term things to work on when I get the GME funds!! I should also add that my current place didn't have any real growth potential until recently as they as expanding so I'm also waiting to see what happens with that as well in the meantime.
🤣
Just doing my part
FB is trending down and they are in the middle of deep shit?? 

What is the hype? 🤨
[deleted]
Nah Im not wrong lol
Energy storage is so interesting to me because it's one of the few industries with *increasing* cost to scales. It applies to TSLA and the million SPACs and companies in that space. The more storage, the worse returns and profitablity.

Basically, energy is priced by load and demand. At 2am on a 72 degree spring night you can get electricity for basically free or even get paid for it to decrease the load on the grid. At 6pm on a hot July afternoon, it can spike to $50+/kWh. Wholesale prices can got from negative to way over 50 easily. A lot of storage is priced to deal with that heavy, high priced load. It makes sense there. But as storage increases, there's a point where the price never gets so high because there is enough excess capacity to drastically lower prices. The bigger the supply of storage, the lower the returns. 

So really, mass storage has to drop well below the current $100/kWh targets to ever be profitable. Unless govts force drastic action, this space will have lots of stops and starts. Unless a dirt cheap solution is found somehow.

Just a follow up on upcoming major tech trends. Any follow up would be appreciated.

I mean the PRPL kings did give solid DD on how its really not a weekly play, like a lot of others have said. I came out up $3k from that play from shares. Pre-ER the run-up was fairly solid to be fair. Looking back PRPL Gang was a fun gradual ride... but then too many YOLO and it spun out of control....
I thot that was e harmony
The name is stupid af all I’m sayin
Is it called grumble?
[removed]
Yes it has gone to shit. However, I wouldn't put GME in that category that made WSB a buy and hold type of place. The /r/investing crowd looks for their annual 7-10% gains. By holding GME shares, everyone here is looking for 100%+ gains. That's very far from the /r/investing mindset. Also, we all know the reason for holding shares in GME and not options. But for about a year now and since we hit the /r/all page, we have become more like the Investing sub than gamblers.
Why are they so cheap
See you in space, bro :)  🚀🚀🚀
Boomer shit

Nothing, just a bunch of bums who have calls expiring trying to pump their boomer stock

I want Seidnet 🚀☄️
Yeahhh I feel you on the premium. I have 300 shares and I keep wanting to sell CCs on them but keep not wanting to miss out. Let’s say a worst case scenario happens - the stock spikes and they get called away but I don’t sell my calls in time, either due to greed or Robin Hood failing ( I bought them before I shifted to a better broker)... I leave with nothing.

That said - don’t let fear of missing out on a spike stop you if you wanna sell those CCs. It could well work out and even if it gets called away and you walk away with profits, there’s a saying I like I heard on here: “no-one ever went homeless from taking profits” IE profit is profit and a win is a win.

There is still potential for MOASS to happen. It's 10% chance if we are lucky, but there is a chance that this is x10-x20 play short term even at $35 per share. If that doesn't happen it's still a x2-x3 play mid term, which is still a very fucking great return if you ask me. To be fair, there is still chance Melvin fucks us somehow and price falls and does not recover for a very long time until they are out on their terms. But it's very unlikely at this point.

My dad has been saying he's gonna do this for 2 years... He spent the first year recording every purchase he made without looking at a single one or matching it up to his bank statements, then the second year deciding that there was too much data for him to go over because he had a full years worth of data so he would do it later.

We're all autists on this sub, but at least we're not morons. I love my dad, but cmon that is such a boomer move. He makes too much money at his job to care though and I hardly make minimum wage so :shrug:

Ummm? 🚀🚀?
All shares purchased (and not available to be loaned out for margin) reduces the total shares available in the float and will not only increase the ceiling of the squeeze, but inch us closer to the start of it too.
It depends on your age and how long have you been working. Since, I don’t know, I won’t comment on the rush. 
Regarding the policy, I am sure there should be a document from your firm that covers your question. You are most likely to find an answer there than here.

Guys if you want to know why FB is pumping. It’s because FB just announced plans to make an electric self-driving rocket ship to Mars that will also create sustainable energy for years through a partnership with Amazon and Tesla.
They tend to be pretty uptight. The industry average is a 30 day lock-up, but they do 60 days just to be extra conservative. But maybe I'll consider that
IV is high. If squeeze is delayed then theta will kill your calls.
Every now and again I post about my NOK 2023 7C LEAPS that I bought for $0.25 and a bunch of other people chime in that they are also super long on these. They're just not as exciting to talk about because they are slow burn lotto plays, not quick explosive growth. But they can be much more profitable. As someone else pointed out, that's what GME started as -- I'm still holding a few of my GME April 8C LEAPS that I bought when the stock was at 5, and which are a 10+ bagger at this point. I didn't make as much as some of the people who just got in over the last week or two, but I also didn't take as much risk so they deserve it. Like you said -- mine were cheap lotto plays.
Fb is the one
[deleted]
Into my anus I hope?
Good question, I don't know. I only have partial knowledge and am retarted 🤷‍♂️ Interesred to know myself.
Why do all the comments seem fake as fuck
Yeah I'm mostly in the ETF. I'm up 36% since buying in only a few months ago, was almost 40 somewhere this week.  I don't think there are many safe plays. Definitely not a normal short, probs not puts that expire any time soon. I'm considering longer dated options.   

I mean, I really believe in EVs, and companies like Tesla and NIO are probably future giants, but that was the same as the internet was in the dotcom bubble. Peiple know EV companies are a big deal, but they don't know how to value them yet, so valuations get detached from reality.   

If we do see an EV crash I'll go all in on EV stocks after and hold for a long time.

Bro, I have 788 shares of GME, using 15,000 of that in margin..so I’d have to close out my entire position then rebuy back in? Like what else would I do? I’m doing the beat I can for GME gang 🤑
I would strongly prefer to just cash out now and not have to work anymore lol. But maybe waiting til the lock up expires is what it'll come to. I just don't really know if I have to abide by the policy once I'm no longer employed there.
"Not at ATH" = 1,2USD (3,2%) lower than ATH

No, floats is the possible limit of shorts.  It's the total of available shares. Shorts can NEVER be higher than the float.  Shorts over 50% of the float COULD be called a squeeze, but there's more to it than that.

I know nobody is discussing them right now, but DKNG 55c are very tempting to me. DKNG has been consolidating around this level for 2-3 months now. With the Super Bowl nearing and DKNG earnings around that same time, I think DKNG might begin it's run up next week. I think this could hit 70 as as we near earnings date as more and more states discuss possibly legalizing mobile sports betting. I think at market open I'm gonna grab some February 55c for 02/18.
What are you talking about? WSB only ever produces winners and soon-to-be-winners (Disclaimer: "soon" could be months to years 🤣)

For the people who don’t understand, Melvin cuckital want us to sell our potential tendies so that they can not lose anymore tendies.
This was probably the best information and well worded back and forth I’ve bad on this sub

Hm 🤔 it feels tricky trying tk strategize this, as the shares being called away at a higher price obviously would result in me having to buy back in at a higher price and probably erasing the premium

I just want collect these premiums badly they look extremely good right now lol, but as you said this can move violently and I do not want to miss a surge but would be upset at a dip again as I spent all Friday buying in the 30s
Ah, you are mistaking what “you” as a retail trader can do with what the brokers can and cannot do! Your broker usually has enough shares that can create the “illusion” for you that you can sell your shares even when they are lended out! But short sellers don’t lend from you, they lend from brokers and brokers that have lended out all of their shares cannot sell them “instantly” since there is no one that create that illusion for them (well, technically there is some tolerance through market makers, but that is highly regulated and doesn’t work like this), so they have to recall their shares first	! This is similar to the concept of “fractional shares”. Technically, there is no such thing, but brokers can create that illusion for their customers!

Well if your position is long, why won’t you hold it till the lock up period expires ? A stupid question perhaps.
Yeah these Feb ICLN calls are getting the diamond hand treatment
16 yr olds are hardly children. Most jurisdictions had a 16 yr Age of Consent not even 50 yrs back. heck you can still get married at 16 in most states with parental consent.
At what price did you hop in?
All I want before I die is a button to put me immediately to sleep for a designated amount of time.
This works against forcing the squeeze, only holding shares to limit available shares in the float can help the squeeze.

In fact it's in their best interest to keep GameStop in the news as much as possible for the free publicity.
Waiting for HAL earnings to get my money down on either it  or bp 2022 calls. Not sure what strike price but looking to get at a low premium 

Also looking forward to seeing my money go down the drain as I will be actually trading options instead of playing Legos with shares forever. Wish me luck autistic brethren ⛽️⛽️⛽️

No, I sold Thursday actually because I'm fucking retarded but can't complain with the profits.

No drives price down
I work in a PA dispensary. Cresco labs and Green thumb industries are my top picks. Both companies are vertically integrated (have licenses to grow the weed and licensed dispensaries). They both put out high quality products that constantly sell out. 

Got in CRLBF in just under $6. Initially wanted a much larger order in the low 5’s but Vanguard fucked me. Required me to call them in order to place my first OTC stock order. Of course it was unusually busy that day and couldn’t get through.  Stock kept rising ever since. Very comparable pattern to GTBIF.

Tell me 🤔

Embarrassing 😂
I don't fully understand the FB hype today but from a technical perspective; I agree $245 support, plus the 200EMA & SMA (institutional supports) is at $250. The pivot is at $275. I could see it retesting the pivot. I dunno maybe play it safe, sell some 240 Put Spreads underneath. Or have your 1st profit target at $275 area.

Here’s my insight then; Tesla $832 was buy put range for me and it hit $880 that day which is why my puts were bought on 1/8. Tesla $632 is the sell range, so when it hits that range, sell (should be by Feb 10th), then flip for ITM calls for 2/19.

she a major thot so u probably dead right
Those trying to pump FB can Zucc my nutz
It would be a covered call

But right now my avg is up to $32 after doubling down my profits 

So if I sell a $33 or $34 call for premium and the stock is anywhere above, my shares are called away, correct?

But if I monitor all day and once my shares are called or I put in a market order to buy back in

Would this be a good strategy?

Additionally is this a bad play for GME gang because fuck Melvin and I want this squeeze to be violent currently on 500 shares and may get more Tuesday unsure If i wait for a dip?

I bought too early Friday and fucked up my average

No. The sp500 is the top 500 companies in the US aka “the market”. It’s a basket of stocks that changes holdings over time. Since forever it has only gone up and to the right. There have been good years, bad years, but over the long run it has averaged about 10% a year for over 100 years and over any rolling 25 year period it has never lost money. If the SP500 were to go “negative” as you put it...or 0....we would have a lot more to worry about then money.

Puts on berries
"Hotseattle" Patrick Naughton enters the chat.
You realize that the shelf registration is capped $100m... that's like <5% of the current market cap. Won't have a significant impact IMO, and long term it would be good for the company's balance sheet. So its really not even a negative point.
the only people losing money on PRPL were short expires. Every single prediction and recommendation from the main guys were somehow accurate. Undervalued warrants, buy shares after a certain price was reached, $35 PT on dec/jan. I'm holding my shares and selling ATM CCs every time it goes up. They're already 50% up from my purchase price and I will likely carry it until they become long term cap gains.
Wtf

> Around 12.8 percent of Volkswagen’s entire market capitalization was on loan as of October 25

Around 140% of GME shares are shorted right now, I know not all of those are on loan but you do the math 140 - 100 = 40 so at least 40% are... 3x what Volkswagon was, and probably a lot more.

Melvin is gonna get fucked so hard that they'll have to re-buy shares from the guys that are exersizing their options, just to buy enough shares to exersize those options
It's way easier with pictures.

> Say I'm long 200 shares of GME, 100 bought on margin. If the margin requirement increases from 75% to 100%, I can sell 12.5 shares and I now have enough collateral to cover the remaining position.

Uhm. Say you borrow 3,500$ on top of the 3,500$ you have. The margin requirement is 75%, meaning you need at least 5,250$ worth of equity in the total 7,000$ position when you only have 3,500$. Wouldn't this mean you have to sell enough of the borrowed margin until you have a position with 3,500$ equity, meaning a total position value of 4,666$ for a total of 2,334$ sold or 66.7 stocks at the 35$ price level?

Did that shit in 2020 and it literally changed my outlook on life. I know what I want to do with my life finally, and one of those things is go to the moon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I’m surprised there aren’t more $MSOS plays on WSB. Am I crazy for thinking this shit will go off this year?
So, the risk with that is if it doesn’t dip and that whole short squeeze happens you miss tons of upside. 

I’m hesitant recommending any new moves other than shares honestly. That said, new options plays totally should be on the writing side rather than buying in my opinion because of the crazy Iv. 

The trouble is the situation means it could literally do anything in any direction violently at any time lol. Shares if it goes down okay that’s annoying but you still hold a share that can do things long term ( and I am convinced of the long term value thanks to RC ), options at this point seem scary to me. 

YMMV and good luck if you do. Don’t sell naked calls though. Covered calls if it fully squeezes you miss upside but you do get profits. Naked calls if the craziness happens you on the hook for crazy money!

My shares are 100% up and my jan2022 calls are already ITM. I don’t go by weeklies so maybe that’s why I’m succesful but PRPL is doing pretty okayish

Been selling CC's and CSP's since August 20 and have netted more than 150k so far.  Mostly, AAPL, but also on some other higher risk high IV tickers. Biggest loss was around \~15-20k on AAPL that got assigned last month - but overall I think it barely put a dent in my profits. 

&#x200B;

Sell strikes which you are comfortable being assigned at, and then wheel over to CSPs until you get your shares back. There's always the risk of getting steamrolled, but if you're sensible and stick to far OTM strikes and 1-2 week DTE, those pennies add up fast.

The technicals on FB are utter shit. Nobody wants this stock. Best case scenario is it drills even further and you catch it for a desperation rally and dump it before it goes back to 220.

Crazier shit has happened. Look at how ZM came back from the dead. I think FB is a legit play at some point, but this thing is drilling hard and I'm not goin near it. Your bet right now is that their ER blows people out of the water. Any hint of bad numbers or guidance and this thing could probably crater to 230 within a few days

It could also cut the dividend, become out of favor for a long time causing serious price depreciation and/or go out of business. There’s a ton of risk putting all your eggs in one basket when it comes to a nest egg and individual companies. If you want to make millions on options to build a nest egg that’s fine, but when it comes to parking that cash afterwards and live off the cash flow you have to diversify to spread the risk, and there’s nothing more diversified than an index fund. Don’t have to worry about a individual company risk or serious cash flow cuts of dividends. I’d take a 1.5% yield spread over 500 companies than a 4% yield in one stock or a handful individuals any day when it comes to 9m dollars.

So this place has turned into a massive game of who can out-shill the shill?

Cramer dragging WSB mainstream truly was a mistake
I feel like every meme like this should have to include the movie it was taken from. I want to watch so many movies based on these.
No one asked for your opinion.  Go to sleep bitch.
That’s impossible
Facebook about will be up 10% EOW 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀
I was thinking the same thing yesterday. At minimum, without the short squeeze, GME could easily double. Got in under $20. Would be a no brained to dump more money in at the current price
🤡

Its at 200 SMA. I'm a dumbass for not buying it at 245 on Thursday (and instead bought AMZN and AAPL weeklies lol)
It wouldn't take that long to write a bot and WSB literally just made news about how may have affected a ticker.
fuck zuckerberg
here's this for now the OF video hasn't been made yet

For this unfamiliar with Diem, a quick google search has determined that Facebook will be launching a new digital asset (like 💩🏅). This currency is set to be announced in early 2021. 👀

Edit: load up accordingly.
And now for a [message from our favorite Zuck the cuck](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E4jQe9h5v5E), the dialysis king
People pullin fb news out of thin air, postin Econ 211 papers and shit lol it’s entertaining at 3 am at least. Shits gonna end up mooning Tuesday from this.
Don't worry, I'm retarded too. BB's listed on the Canadian stock exchange too (BB is a Canadian company, also listed on NYSE).

I could be wrong (I'm in UK) but think it's only a public holiday in the US, so how it trades tomorrow in Canada might give an indication of how it opens on Tuesday in the US.

What's happening with Facebook? Much appreciated 🙏🏼
Might be the case but I saw DD on it after Friday close and was like FUCKKKK. I instead bought AMZN and AAPL weeklies lol
Does GME gave a facebook page?
yeah I'm only half kidding lol
Get them gainz bruh
You are a legend, I am in on PLTR as well but only 1200 shares, wish i could afford to buy more haha

FB 🟩
Have you ever noticed in a group thread if you can get a couple people posting something enough, you can get the whole group to start repeating it?
How do people end up in these situations, where tf the freaks at
FB

1. FB ultimately is a bet on top of funnel e-commerce but it’s treated as fuzzy “social 
media”, as if that’s an appropriate description of a business. Companies stopped 
spending on ads in 2Q2020 but ramped up super quickly afterwards, think it’s 
underappreciated by how much. If e-commerce has blowout earnings, I assume that FB 
would at least beat consensus earnings estimates. 

2. Things have been very noisy, due to politics, but on 27.01.2021 FB has earnings and it 
will remind people of numbers and business reality.
Cramer needs to show this graph to his viewers.

Well I didn't try to write some next level research, some people just had to learn some basic stuff. I have no ambition to spend multiple hours on a DD that is skimmed through or ignored because no rockets. The people that would read in full probably already know this.

The Wikipedia page is bad imo. First sentence of the intro says they don't do phones anymore. Followed by 50 sentences about their phones, followed by the history of their phones. That's the problem.
80 p/e looks scary, but I’ll dig deeper. Thank you 👍
The real founders of this sub know it’s Donkey dicking ^^🍆🍆
Every FB comment is getting fucking diamonds now or platinum or whatever the fuck
What up bri
cuz burry
This. Also if BB does rip those calls at 10-12 will have such low volume it may be hard to get rid of them.
Yeap we are so opening mega dildo redbone Tuesday lol

Then up on Wednesday if no one does at dc
Market cap $10T. That’s conservative too
Is it a bad idea to sell calls then?

Id like to collect premiums if it dips and just buy back in
Wtf is diem?
Could I ask you about your opinion on BB? It feels like people are very polarized about this stock.
Bearish on BUTCORN for awhile. Back down you go. Timber.

Don't worry. Roll back a couple months, I did the exact same thing when it hit it's last peak - bought at $8ish before it tanked down to $6ish. 

Was holding those bags for a while, but now it's looking very good. This will be you soon! (unless it tanks again, then we'll both be fucked...)

I saw every uptick on dollar over 1 implied reduced equities 5%, hard to tell with asset inflation going on. Either the Value of assets is lying, or the value of the dollar is. 1+1=3 is not reality. Shidcoin dump may be another sign of reversal. Bought 20k Tesla puts on 1/8 dates March 19. Planning to exit week before the 19th runup on another squeeze. You know wtf is going on? I went to Aldi’s today and meat prices were up again like 30%.

The kid is predicting 24T for tesla by 2030. Thats like saying it will be nearly half of the entire SP by then, assuming the sp500 basically doubles from its current 30T to ~60T by then.

Tesla might be big big in 2030 but there's just no way anything is worth 24T in 2030 short of some zimbabwesque hyper inflation scenario. For 24T they'd have to be doing pretty much a minimum of 1T in earnings per year

Honestly Facebook is trading at a ridiculously low price. If Tuesday is red I'm going half in on June calls and not looking back.
bad for squeeze but fine for regular holds right? or does your broker literally say "fuck you, you don't get these shares back" ?

Hey fuk u again
Yeah I only went over cybersecurity quick although it is their biggest part. But I had no idea what the importance level of their different cybersec applications is, and they have to freaking much to talk about them all :o
Sorry Mr Wookie
I wouldn’t say terrible analogy. I’m not saying it’s a guaranteed thing at all, just saying there’s a perspective that it isn’t a crazy bet.

GME is also making pushes into PC building and there’s tons of enthusiast market for that. Micro center has been doing well forever but there’s definitely a supply gap with GME being everywhere and MC isn’t. 

Additionally, Microcenter is intimidating for people into gaming but new to the build side of things. Yes, the employees will walk you through but IMO there’s a valid play with a streamlined version selling probably overpriced components and yes - physical computer games. Just because it doesn’t exist anymore doesn’t mean there isn’t a community of people who’d love it.

I miss owning box copies of games. Yeah, all this is far from guaranteed but to act like it’s totally outside the realm of possibility is IMO short-sighted. If there’s a man who gets what would be needed, it’s RC. Also, GME is listening - multiple stores are rumored to be trialing Pc build kiosks and pushing employees with PC knowledge. 

That kind of transition won’t happen overnight but a store that’s somewhere between microcenter and what EBgames used to be? That would be amazing and I could see it being interesting to see.
Its amazing in 4K60 and 1080/120hz pvp if your TV supports it
so calls on AYX, thanks
Look at you mother zuckers begging for gold. You guys know gold doesn’t do anything right?
FB schills saw what happened with GME...trying to pump
Some info about how much you need to move a stock....volume!........is what I am getting is the game

It depends on the volume. Investing $500 in a **stock** that trades under $2 and has a volume of under 5K should **move** it.
Wait what about FB!? Will my 02/05 270c which are already down like $6500 (55%), go green by earnings!? 😢😢😢

Blowjob room, call it *headquarters*
They said they could issue 100m dollars worth of shares, although when pressed on it, they said they didn't need to.

At 40, that is 2.5m shares. Not going to be enough to save the shorts. But also, don't think the board would at all have any interest in going that.

Hey Zuckerfart! Buy GME instead of spending your money on stupid awards!
Diem
I just want to retail parts somewhere that isnt best buy/microcenter cuz they arent close/ arent even in my state
I agree - the series S makes no sense for a digital console with the limited usable memory, and the digital ps5 isn't that much cheaper... But I still think it's a sign of the shift.  

And I've always been a physical buyer myself, but find myself buying digital more recently now due to more regular sales and better backward compatibility etc. 

And when I do buy physical, I no longer do it at our GameStop equivalent because it's cheaper from the supermarket or Amazon.

But...I still agree - there's plenty of life left, and the collectors editions you mention, new gen, merch, and increasing retail interest around hardware will all help (think I read somewhere about pc custom build stations being a possibility?).
That’s not FB

Right now, yes, we can only grind out the gains. They will try to shake us out, but we are too retarded to let go, and since shares don't expire we can play the samw game over and over.
why?

Love this movie
I put a few buck in BB&B and Im tripled ($90 in and at $340 or so) ....I am keeping an eye on them after GME because any profit I may roll into BB&B and BB.

Why is FB trending? Is Zuck in here?
Why everyone on FB dick rn?

Worst case scenario you bag hold for a year
Who is buying puts / vix calls here?
Do you know what the particular rule for that is? Sounds surprising given that they all have tiny amounts of shares

#I love Zucc
Never options, always shares, especially if it’s to help a short squeeze happen. If you buy shares, it’s less shares that Melvin and those fuckers can buy at that price. If everybody buys and holds, they’ll have to buy at a higher price. Hopefully at $420.69 lol
FB - fuck bitches

Cathie Wood Effect. NOK in space by end of 2022.  Cathie might add a position in her new Space ETF when NOK is further along. Probably not now, but only takes an infamous pumper to mention the two together and will moon. Based on 2020, market cap means shit during this kangaroo market.  Speculative stocks jump 100%+ in market cap within a week based on news.
Ok.....?
I don't.
Just have to want it. My free time now isn’t spent with of friends or going places. I spend my night working legally, finding plays in the market and sim racing. That keeps me somewhat sober

Fuck u
It is part of the life cycle of the autist. Take care of your $200. Nurture it. Gasp at every $5 gain or loss. 

Eventually you will get retard luck and turn that $200 into $1000. Then you'll be convinced of your genius and slowly bleed it back to $100 over the next 6 months. Then you'll get de-sensitized to the real-world dollar value of your portfolio.

Then you'll have a bad day at work and think "fuck this, either gonna be homeless or YOLO into not needing to work. 

Then you are ready.

Modeling old squeezes is pointless. Both KBIO and VW triggered their squeezes with announcements. Unless we get one, all we can do is grind until firms fold, and we don't know where that point is.
Same. My March -> December portfolio, trying to play it like a smart r/investing type, went from **$10k -> $18k.** Hooray right? M-M-M-MONSTER GAINS, 80% holy frijole. 

My Jan 1st -> Today gains, when I - bitter about my lost TSLA stock package - said "fuck this shit" and went all in on tech calls: **$18k -> $62k.** 

Yolo autist shit is the only way.
Id rather trust the people that have accurately predicted other GME milestones so far, like [this guy](https://twitter.com/KjetillStjerne?s=20)

Yeah, I'm just holding what I can hoping for a squeeze. The last thing I want is to miss another spike since I pulled out of GME last second for the first spike.
Yes, that really happened. He went long when prices were negative then he gave it to the tanker guy for free.
Not too late for gme. And BB hasn’t even started the real mooning yet either...

I mean that line is directly taken off the Wikipedia (I know that’s not the best source) but it’s also essentially a rephrasing of the first sentence of the abstract of the paper in your link. Psychology Today’s article on it describes the effect the same way as the abstract and the Wikipedia. The ignorance about ones ignorance is written like a cause of the effect not the effect itself the way I’m reading it.

Anecdotally, I think the new consoles with physical drives are more in demand than the digital versions.  I know I wouldn’t buy a console without a disk drive. That doesn’t meant the digital shift won’t happen or accelerate, but physical will not go away like a lot of 🐻think.

If GameStop can make a compelling pitch to buy physical, people will do it.  I personally collect Collector Editions and steel books.  It’s the same reason why vinyl has had a resurgence in popularity.  People place value on a physical item and the tangible process of taking a disc out of its case and placing it in.

I was in a situation today while standing in line which had me going wtf. I was just waiting in line to check some items out and these 2 people were having a conversation. It seemed pretty flirtatious, as the guy was trying to get the girls number. He ended up failing, but his entire reaction to what she said when rejecting him was fucking hilarious. She told the guy, "maybe next time kid." Dude just spazzed. Started basically yelling how he has a 9.5 inch cock repeatedly in the store. When he got to the register, he was telling the cashier can you believe this bitch. He was really offended by her saying kid because he had a 9.5 inch cock. The entire thing was so strange lol. Hope everyone having a good night.

Fuck yeah

Get on the APHA, CGX and BB train. If you want a becky stock, ATZ.
What concerns me the most is the obvious hype that happened with renewables. I went in some time before Corona and expected gains like this to "maybe" happen over the next 3-5 years, given that a lot of those companies I invested in are not profitable and that technologies like hydrogen still do not have a determined future.

But then 2020 came and my investment doubled. I'm not saying these companies will fail or have not future but I am a bit concerned there might be a pull-back ahead once a few quarterly reports are below expectations etc.

I'll not go all-out but I bagged in some profits by now - just in case. :)

Realistic price for open/ Tuesday? As aren't their a lot of shorts that just expired that have to cover over the weekend.
What BB calls should I do? Thinking of a 1/22 $10 call semi yolo. How dumb is that? Then if those print buy some BB leaps

OEM copies are very cheap, but if you change out to many components, they are no longer valid. Non-oem is a bit more though.

I'm sure Microsoft would not cry about these PCs coming with Windows pre-installed though (and baked into the price).
I agree with you overall, but the digital sales part isn't as far away as next gen. It's already shifting (which is why you see digital only versions of both the new gen consoles).

Subscription models will become the norm (with game pass leading the way) and streaming games will be pushed much harder.  All of it will push a move to digital.
 
Having said that, there'll always be a good chunk of people who want physical, and there's no reason why GME can't do well in digital sales anyway (like CD Keys already do, but think they're in Europe only?).

https://moxreports.com/kbio-infinity-squeeze/

I think right now we are at the jump from 0.60 to 2.00 that they called "the squeeze." Then it ran up to 39.50 the next week. If we scale proportionally, that would be roughly a jump from $10 to $40, calling it the squeeze, and then it running to $800. I think they're sweating.

TUESDAYYYYYYYY...Monday is a holiday in the US
Lol “such a thing doesn’t exist today.”

Such a thing literally always exists by definition. The trouble is we don’t know what market is going to be popping in three years. It could be tons of these biotech firms trading sideways doing research that hasn’t planned out yet.

Tech is exploding, but the reason this shit looks obvious in hindsight is because the next market operates on rules we don’t understand yet.

Even if everything crashes the next boom still exists right now we just don’t know and can’t know. 

I’m doing some long plays on boomer value stocks since the market has been disconnected from fundamentals so long that I’m hoping post-crash and post-end times we reset to stock market basics and rotate to value.

Of course I could be half right and still totally wrong if whatever crash comes takes out all the old and provides a new definition of what “value” even is. That’s my only point. You can’t evaluate the future when you don’t know the rules of the game yet. It’s why they joke technical analysis is technical astrology lol. It’s good at predicting the future in a world where the same rules are in effect, but blind to rule changes ( like this old sci fi show I can’t  remember - it had a time travel to Pompeii where there were oracles who could legit see the future perfectly but couldn’t see the volcano blowing because it was out of their mental model)
I just bought AMD and Nvidia. I think Infineon or On could be the next one

Good thing Monday market is closed
On that, their Schedule 13D specifically amended DGCL 203 to redefine RC's available purchasing power from 15% to 20%

That is, I think Cohen will use his 7% buy of GME tactically, rather than for strictly personal gains. If he wanted to buy for personal gains, he would have bought already. But there's no form-4 to speak of, so he hasn't bought within these last few chaotic days.


I personally am hoping he strategically buys the 7% on a day where there is limited float in order to push GME either into a strong call ramp or into short-squeeze territory

I have some buddies and family in healthcare and they all opted for mostly moderna and a few astrazeneca. ~~I haven't heard of any complications from any vaccine yet~~ (*scratch that there was the botox thing for moderna*) but the most common complaint is the temperature storage requirement for the pfizer one even though it seems to have the lowest failure rate. You just can't tell if there was some snafu somewhere between the manufacturer and you which means you're getting a useless vaccine.
so what kind of quarters do you want on the moon base?
I told my family about SEARS. My seven year old niece that heard the conversation asked if I could get her free SEARSbux. Now her parents are waiting for this day as well. But I did warn them it was going to be a wild ride.

Agreed, also a vast majority of the bears is complaining about the trade in prices "people" get at GME. I guess half the bear thesis is "I feal pissed because those people fucked me over when I was 12".

Given the average age of people on the sale floors, this might even be true for the 'tutes.

AAPL will moon next week, yeah you with those $130 calls you heard me
Yikes re-reading my old posts is like reading my old diary entries. A ton of things I got wrong, and the thesis has since changed, but I'm flattered u/wighty.

Truth is, there is no telling what Cohen has planned for GameStop.

What's true is: 

1) GameStop is not going bankrupt anytime soon. They bought back debt recently and can use the shelf offering with the recent rise in price to buy back $100M more, or keep it as cash reserves.

2) Cohen will lay out his plan for a GME transformation soon.

3) There are 78M shares short. 

All the other details are just decoration. They don't derail the freight train. Whether or not Cohen turns this around is up in the air. Some think he can, others think he can't.

What you need to ask yourself is: can the shorts hold a position that is -200% underwater while paying 30% margin interest? What if brokers start margin calling these back? The risk is on the short side.
This is actually good #BLACKS4GME

Careful buying new options if that’s what you mean. The IV is so high that if it trades sideways for a bit which is totally in the realm of possibility you can get crushed if Iv comes down
I don't think many people here have any available funds due to being all in on GME, myself included. Try again some other time.
Not me. Moon shot and then go safe lol
Stop sucki g his dixk. Yall simps. They gonna say this short squeeze is cuz of us when its Nelvins fault. Yall gonna get us bannee
Holy shit that's the largest dividend I've ever seen (7.13%!!) and it's gone sideways since 2002 so you don't have to worry about it drilling. Perfect hedge against a correction this year.

:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:| :---: |:---:|          
$38 | +$300 | +$538 | +$22 | | $42 | +$160 | -$20 | -184
$40 | +$500 | +$419 | +$222 | |$45 | +$460 | +$280 | +$66
$42 | +$700 | +$575 | +$422 | |$50 | +$960 | +$780 | +$566
$45 | +$1000 | +$875 | +$712 | |$55 | +$1460 | +$1280 | +$1066

I guess considering the smaller premium and higher maximal gain, a LEAP for January is the better play.

Spot is definitely not the most important thing here, you are laying way too much emphasis on it. Prices across the fuel cycle for SWU and UF6 have increased a substantial amount in the last few years and as always it will trickle down to the start of the fuel cycle, which is the uranium that comes out of the ground. Spot will move, it has to, or the lights will go out.

If I had gold Id give it to you.
It's very important to understand that when Melvin does a short sale on the equity they are essentially selling non existant shares to then open market trying to drive the price down...its an expensive manipulation strategy. Also, when they sell puts, MMs need to hedge which also drives the price down.

TLDR, there is no price target. If we all put sell limit orders at 420, then that's the price target. That's the price Melvin has to pay to close their shorts.

to all of you who are thinking about selling GME, trust the process. A couple weeks ago, people bought at $22 and sold for a massive loss. Several people bought at $38 and probably sold at $32 for a massive loss. Those paper handed pussies could have been in the deep green right now, but they have no faith. Even if you bought at $42, you will be in the green soon. DIAMOND HANDS 💎

Can someone explain like I'm 5?   We're raging buying the shit out of GME to fuck the short sellers, right??  Is that what we're doing????  LMFAO
Then I guess I don’t really have much to lose 🚀
You’re just dating, nbd. Have a threesome
This is great info, thank you.  

I have numbers in my account. X in stocks and options, y in brokerage cash. X+Y is my portfolio value. I also have access to an amount of 'instant deposit'

If I use most of my brokerage cash to buy GME stock come Tuesday morning, will it be on margin? How, if it is money that came out of my bank account long ago, and I haven't sold out bought anything for awhile?
Do we have evidence of how that maps into short interest published? 

And I don’t think it’s that bearish for bond holders to hedge especially with how cheap a $1 put is now.
Yes it is

You still have pretty much the same profit as the option, but now there is no expiration.  You can just wait for a spike/squeeze to sell, or sell a covered call against it.  Even the furthest otm call for next week has a decent premium ($100 for 60 strike).  If it hits 60 on Friday he'd make $4100 per contract minus what he paid for his 20c.  If not he just takes $100 and reevaluates next week.

The disadvantage is now he owns the stock and his capital is tied up.  And if course it could go down but most people seem to think it's headed up at least through April.
You guys done roasting r/dividends? Damn.
You can also sell premium at 20$ and 25$ and 30$

13 days out looks solid

And if it drops to 25$.. You better be buying anyways

My cost is 18$

So I'm going to sell premium non stop on the puts to make those shares free

Your broker can change the leverage requirement. Currently you may only need 50:1 (leverage : collateral). If it increases to say 25:1 and you can't meet the requirement then your position is sold at whatever price. Brokers can the change the requirements for a given stock if they view it to be too volatile. 

I believe Fidelity has already increased their requirements for GME with other brokers expected to follow on Tuesday. Can't find a source for this though.

Point number three means absolutely fuck all, have you seen DASH?? That is literally the worst "company" on earth and look at it's IPO and then post IPO price. ROBLOX will moon to triple what it's IPO is for no fucking reason at all. Should Tesla actually be the *fourth largest* company in the world? No.
we have no evidence that I’ve seen that Melvin had any position other than the puts. Did you see something?

I know from experience that retail investors spook about direct short a lot more than margin long. I can’t imagine this is any different. The only people I know who short big and for a long time are ex and current hedgies

Retail longs are a mix of stock and calls for sure. I just don’t think they direct short nearly as much as they put.
And then get shot in the face? lol

Wtf happened to r/leakedonlyfans? Need another onlyfans subreddit or locations boys drops those links
Here's a quick rundown on how to do stocks trading for all the newbies here.

You buy random shit from here, then you fucking HOLD IT.

You're in a bubble market with free cash money flow, DON'T BE A SMART ASS, YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE DOING. JUST HOLD IT AND RIDE THE WAVE.

Maybe trim your wins until you get your investments back, then HOLD IT AGAIN, THEN YOU HAVE LITERALLY NOTHING TO LOSE.
Don't use stash for time based trading. They only execute trades twice a day.
If you’re not throwing money into GME, you must love being poor 😩

i thought this was bearish b/c the brokers want to protect retail traders from blowing out their accounts when/if gme crashes 20% in a day. so they are effectively hampering retail traders from buying lots of gme to their hearts content. big boys/players can still short on margin if they want, through some custom trading agreement

You don't just have to look at different stocks but make different bets completely. There is a chance everything blows up in a 2001/2008 way. Even if the chance is small, consider a large market event to the downside and then think of what would pay out the best in a dumpster fire? Just look for crazy low IVs and what spiked in March.

Two countertrend lottos for you:

Deep OTM TLT calls - if bonds revert and claw up to 165 the could easily spike 180+ as the heavy put volume unwinds. You can buy 180 calls for pennies even months out.

Near term HYG or JNK puts that are a few dollars OTM. These have stupidly low IV and there is a real risk that something like congress blocking the stimulus or some black swan event could cause a flush of high yield debt. The put price drops off a cliff quickly OTM, but too far in the future reduces this greatly. Instead, keep rolling puts around a month out until something happens because if something happens in these it can happen quick. Something like a 3 dollar drop (not uncommon for these historically, especially in a wacky market) could become a 10 bagger within a week.

The naked call is the neutral-bearish position. 

When you going long stock to cover the short call, you now have far more to lose  when the stock tanks than if it moons. That is what it means to cover the call. 

Remember that the obligation you're agreeing to when you sell the call is "I agree to sell 100 shares of the stock at X agreed upon price at or before expiration-date (Say, Feb 19) 

If you go long stock to cover the call (what a covered call means) then you have the shares in your portfolio to sell. If GME moons, then you're still okay because you own the shares that covers the call. 

To quote my previous reply to someone else:

 

Suppose you bought 100 shares of GME at 30.00 ( 3000 USD starting principal)

You sell the 32 call expiring Feb 19 for \[say\], 1.00

GME moons to 420.69 at Feb 19

Your short call which you sold is now worth a fuck-tonne. Since you are short that, that's not good for you.

Your long position is worth now 100 \* 420.69 => 42069 USD

Your short call position is now worth ( 100 \* ( 420.69 - 32 ) ) => 38869 USD

Your net position is 42069 - 38869 => 3200 USD

If you exit this position as expected (because your ITM short call gets exercised as expected) then you walk away with 3300 USD, a 300 USD profit from your initial investment. (Because you sold the call for 1.00 credit)

You're not fucked. You profited. A small profit in comparison to going long in the shares without writing a call.

&#x200B;

Yeah, you're not selling the contract in HOPE that it gets exercised. But by covering that position, you're not destroyed in the case that the call does get exercised. 

If GME moons, you are strictly better off just going long stock than going with a covered call position. 

If GME does not moon, but sits just around the strike price, then you get to keep your shares and get the full premium of the option. 

If GME does moon, then you get your shares called away, and you keep the premium. You profit if the strike price is higher than your purchase price of the shares, plus the premium. You would have been better off not selling the call though. 

Covered calls has a capped upside, but they turn a profit in a neutral scenario. That's the payoff of the covered call. 

But when you go long stock, you now have the value of the shares you paid for as a risk. If GME instead tanks, you're losing if you need to exit that position - you have an unrealised loss. 

You are right in that you don't sell covered calls if you seriously do not want to risk losing your shares. If you can't sleep at night if Tesla is not part of your portfolio, then it would be foolish to sell calls against Tesla covered by the shares. That is correct. 

You would sell covered calls if you were apathetic to the stock being in your portfolio. You're not very concerned about whether or not it's there. If your shares get called away, no big deal. You might sell puts on the same underlying with a strike below the call strike in that case. If the shares do not get called away, no big deal, you sell another call dated later after it expires. 

These strategies are primarily neutral - betting against big moves of the stock. That's why sometimes they're wrong and have uncapped downsides. The risk of the naked call is the stock mooning. The risk of the short naked put is the stock crashing. But these positions win if the stock does not moon nor crash. 

The moment you cover the short call with long-stock it ceases to be bearish. Long stock is a bullish position, and counters the bearish inclination of the short call to form a neutral strategy that can have a bullish outlook, but capped on its bullish upside.

Being net long and being net long through margin are vastly different things in this context. Why assume most retail traders are purchasing GameStop shares on margin? Vs.... the typically more common approach of buying OTM calls/weeklies? You use that idea that retail would typically short through short dated OTM puts and then don’t use the same logic on the longs? Why? 

I don’t understand how you can say Melvin was already squeezed when they have yet to close their share position ? Yes we are aware they were squeezed on their ITM puts.

I mean, it might be necessary, too. Donny Pump gave us yuge green dildos everyday. Sleepy Joe will put most of the market to sleep and reduce volatility (gains) and we will need to be smarter about our picks because in the Donny Pump market everything always went up so it was easy. Pivoting to becoming a pseudo institutional buyer of GME might be critical for our short and long term tendies.
Seriously this is the funniest shit I've ever seen 🚀  🚀  🚀
Oof bro so salty. Vegas sucks.
What they said about undisclosed direct shorts and check the float and short interest. Melvin will pay if it squeezes of course, but their 5mm shares in puts alone surely cannot account for the 70mm+ shares short. There are more out there

I used to keep up with latest tech, but that was well over a decade ago. Really enjoyed the service I got from a Fry's on last budget build. I started with a budget and inventory of parts I already had. Discussed best budget friendly option, a step up and a step down option for each remaining component. In less than 15m I was walking away with $500 spent and a bunch of components. It was a very pleasant experience, and everything worked flawlessly. 

As it sits, I've always had a slight hatred for gamestop - they ate up all the small niche shops and local businesses throughout the 2000s as the market consolidated. But despite being a small time gamer with a console, I dont currently have much of a reason to go into a gamestop. Against my better judgment, I found the convince of buying games digitally far outweighs the potential posterity loss. To capture my money, something needs to change.

If gamestop can rebrand (or open stores in market for PC builds), this is definitely a way to get my dollars. I've been looking to have this level of service available again.

Wait so you're telling me, depending on the cost basis you got in on APHA, you are making a profit when the exchange to the .83 TLRY shares occurs. Say my cost basis was $7.50. Thats a guaranteed profit when the exchange occurs. This seems to good to be true am I misunderstanding it lol

It's been like that for a while now
The amount of shares available for borrowing shows shorts are unwinding their positions.   They are buying and returning shares back (to be possibly borrowed again if someone is foolish enough to try to short it during this squeeze).

Yes because how they manage their video game console is a great indicator of how massive company operates. 

Almost as dumb as people who think not winning the “console war” will impact Microsoft at all.
You are wrong.  $100M worth of shares is the shelf offering that is approved.  At $50/share it would only be 2M new shares which is about 3% of outstanding shares it wouldn't even help. At $100/share it is half that.  The shorts are over 100% of outstanding shares..

Doesn't help them.  Wouldn't surprise me if they announced a share buy back of $100M at $40/share to trigger a price hike and them offer shares when the price is over $100/ share to pay for that buyback and end with fewer shares available overall.  They have left their options open to do whatever the need to.  Very smart in my opinion.
I honestly would like to see both, no reason we can’t both be right :)

I feel like RH has better options - Stash is super basic. I have $400 in GME on there but I like the ability to control more with RH. Well see Tuesday the news and prices and is RH gets back to me. I might be forced to stay with Stash and just drop everything with them since its already linked with the bank. Well see.... I got wind of all this retardation too late to probably deal with the waiting period to link with RH. Either way, 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀💫💫

Try to figure out what holdings will be in ARKX and get in those before. Lots of ppl will invest in ARKX and the ones you guessed correctly will see a nice profit. After that you can sell the individual stocks and get some ARKX. What am i missing here?
Does the number of casual people getting into trading worry y’all ?
You’re not I wrong, I don’t think, but why not both crowds? Honestly if I had a buddy getting into pc building and didn’t feel like the hassle of putting it together I’d totally go with him to GME and use a kiosk like that.

If on top of helping a buddy, I was also bringing in my old rig that they were willing to trade in for a new one or individual parts, etc, that’s just more reason for us both to be there. 

The internet is crazy convenient but some people just want to do things in person for the social aspect of it, their money is good too.

Because no auto company has done anything tech wise to get a huge advantage? Tesla might if their in house battery ever actually materializes and is as good as Elon is fantasizing about but right now no one has a “next gen” EV or true FSD. It’s still anyone’s game and will be for a while. 

The whole “boomer car companies don’t know how to make an EV” thing is just a misconception. They’re still making ICE cars because ICE is still more profitable, not because a battery powered car is beyond their capability.

Q R S,
This is the part that confuses me. Is it actual boomers selling these naked calls or just younger people on the wrong side of the move? I thought most boomers shudder at even going long an option let alone naked calls?? This makes so little sense to me what is the actual thought behind boomers taking on that kind of risk for a capped, and farrrrrr less significant gain? Why not just sell 5% of your ETFs and long some puts?

Honestly for GME I rather it have a slow squeeze up to 100 and have the price hold there rather than an instant jump to 500 and having it tanked down to 20

That’s great to hear. I think most people need to watch the interview with Sam Galleti to fully understand the companies growth prospects. They haven’t even marketed yet  but are still competing with really established companies. When they do start to market their products (which they plan to go all out for in 2021), then demand will be through the roof. His plan is for everyone to know about this company and launch a marketing campaign with 2 billion 6 second impressions.
When should I buy GME, Tuesday or Wednesday? 🤔

Fembois are a go

TLDR
What is the scenario where the stock tanks and all us tards get burnt? Haven't seen it so curious about the doomsday scenario. Also it's gonna be a crazy mad dash to sell when we all figure it's time, because it sounds like it'll top off quickly. Should be fun when it goes down. Not sure how many people plan to hold this long term after the squeeze. GL all
So what you're saying is if I'm on Robinhood and I set all my shares to limit sell at $420.69 they can't be loaned out to 🌈🐻?
Aren’t they infamous for shorting Tesla from like 5 years back they are fukd 🌈🧸
Yoo the CC income from this
Disagree.

Suppose you bought 100 shares of GME at 30.00 ( 3000 USD starting principal)

You sell the 32 call expiring Feb 19 for \[say\], 1.00

GME moons to 420.69 at Feb 19

Your short call which you sold is now worth a fuck-tonne. Since you are short that, that's not good for you.

Your long position is worth now 100 \* 420.69 => 42069 USD

Your short call position is now worth ( 100 \* ( 420.69 - 32 ) ) => 38869 USD

Your net position is 42069 - 38869 => 3200 USD

If you exit this position as expected (because your ITM short call gets exercised as expected) then you walk away with 3300 USD, a 300 USD profit from your initial investment. (Because you sold the call for 1.00 credit)

You're not fucked. You profited. A small profit in comparison to going long in the shares without writing a call.

That is the capped upside of a covered call. If the underlying moons, your gains are limited because of the short call.

If this were a bearish position, (say a NAKED short call, which is what you're probably thinking of) then you would be fucked.

When you are selling a covered call, you're not betting that the underlying would drop - why would you buy shares if you were betting that the underlying would drop? That's counter to the bet!

The bearish plays would be: Selling a naked call (what you're likely thinking of) buying a put (the classic bear option play) or shorting the stock (what the institutions have been doing)

A covered call is less bullish than going long stock, because of the capped upside.

A covered call is not bearish. If the underlying tanks, you lose money.

That is why I call it "neutral-to-bullish" which is the more wordy form of "not bearish"
Fuk Citi, what do banks actually know except inflate housing prices and ipo companies!!!! PLTR to the moon!!!!!! 🚀 🚀 🚀

There is one every important difference to DVDs and Video Games and why there will always be physical copies. GAMES SIZES ARE FUCKING HUUUUUGE. I just got the new xbox and game pass, and have already maxed out the hard drive. 

It's way more convenient to be able to have your favourite games in hard copy. Even with ultrafast fibre in NZ it'll take a few hours to download a new game. Physical copies, no waiting. 


TLDR: Buy GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀

I haven't even got my stimulus yet...
Entire market has huge volatility that is being accounted for in pricing of all Leaps.  No one sells them out that far without assuming some black swan event given the last year.

Those huge returns are coming from stable years when Leaps were sold not taking into account black swan events actually can and do happen. I would say that mispricing is what allowed those huge returns.  Show me another company that increased 1/2 of what Tsla did in 2020.

This is such a dirty manipulative post. This whole thing reads like you are a bear but then you add these weird positive bullish comments here and there. I suppose you’re trying to make yourself sound more reasonable? It’s disingenuous.

Either way you should edit with your positions. You know the rules. 

I am intrigued you understand the power of retail traders and are making such a long drawn out effort to convince a bunch of retards to lend out their shares for “yield enhancement”. Lmfao. 

Why do you assume that most of the large short positions are institutional and therefore don’t have an issue with margin changes and you don’t make the exact same assumption with longs? Most of the stock is still owned from institutions just like most of the shorts are by institutions.

Newish to trading, technicals not my strong suit.  But, basically dominos was trading for sub $10 I believe and then went through a transformation and now in the $400s.  

This is how I imagine the long term GME.  Ryan implements his GMEplan and a year from now people start looking at the stock from a different angle.

Markets closed on Monday, watch the market dip Tuesday morning and then buy then. Wednesday will most likely have an opening...if we are up near $60 somehow on Thursday prepare for a 10% drop like last friday. Lots of options expiring again next week. Not as much as this prior week, but still a lot.

And regarding jobs - once again, tons of opportunities if you are willing to tough it out and not constantly switch jobs.

Don’t bother pointing out how stupid this stock is, it’s just like tesla, they will mouth foam insults at you until it eventually fails, but like tesla, could be years?

Are you saying to hedge with these positions or hedge if you have these positions
Very sound FD plays
complex carry trade + postal reply coupon arbitarage = tendies
And we are criticized for “market manipulation”
GME can go down for sure (short term.)

It’s being price manipulated by short sellers with tons of money to blow. BUT at some point they will see the losses and just call it a day.

Just make sure you got the cash to cover if you are margin called, then you’re good.
Maybe just one more turn...
Lol
More risk than a dividend etf and plus you have to manage the property or hire someone to
So calls forever?
Damn it!  I can't see the replacements.  Please tell me, the emoticons used are paramount to my investment strategy.

Why did I turn down coinbase. Retard here. Hi
I think it’s primed for more volatility. It could do either. This is saying slightly, slightly easier higher, but also could drop fast down. What I’m sure of is the option structure primes volatility at those points.

sucks how financial success won't change my feelings or vices. the brain is retarded
At this price, Friday is a light sell by dealers if nothing else is going on

If we are in the 50s, it’s a big sell. If in the 20s I believe it becomes a buy. Depends on how the week unfolds and what the open interest is going into Friday. It won’t be as much as 1-15 no matter what tho, that was yearly expiration.

The irony
ABB my friend, I’ve been buying these up for month now. They are in EV space, automation and robotics and they actually make money! PE ratio is super low and your can buy LEAPS hella cheap, I got Jan 2023 LEAPS expiring at $27,$30 and $35
You we are all about conspiracy theor how exactly do you think we’re even talking about GME right now...do tell
There was an announcement in Seeking Alpha.

Also PLTR 🚀🚀
Look at it. It's a rocket doesn't even look where it's going, it just goes up.
Fuck it, going in with another 2k on Tuesday.

Not reading the article but how do you retire on stock gains without selling a single share
And if they’ve even been exercised yet (hell, I’m not going to start unloading my calls until the short interest has dropped 60-70% during the infinite squeeze).
He’s gonna come out and say he’s the Chairman now.
I’m like 7K from my margin Maintenence. The only way this is a risk for me is if it goes down which obviously it is not 🚀
It’s dropping further than that. Check out my DD.

Do you think AOC trades
why do you retards want the Dollar to crash?
That's actually the call I  would get.  Gives everyone a few days to digest what was presented during demo day.  If they knock the presentation out of the park, especially for the commercial side, PLTR could rocket that week.

Nah. I kept switching around. 
I’d sell at a spike, find a dip in another stock, and do that over and over.
Already down 20k in 2 weeks? I'll be there soon if AMD keeps tanking. Buying the dip hasn't worked out for me lately. First with QS and FDX last month.  Now it's AMD and V.

Also in this big time, even tho its WSB most controversial ticker. 

New CEO who knows how to run major distribution programs  (Reliva - which is now owned by ACB giving literslly clear cut access to US market)
Cash on hand is pretty good for atleast 2023, debts are thus payable. 
They are now shifting towards a profit turning business with huge redundancies taking place, and their low cost of production now will be a huge advantage if they want to push things to the next level.
DM the ticker.
He did say he'd be long gone - he's def roped by now.
Just open a leap spread
275shares in been in a while averaging down but if it tanks again pouring everything towards it. If I had stronger guts I could have bought a few hundred shares around 5$
BB shares or options? Match 15s doable?
Ive been skeptical about the icar too, seems like they announced it to capitalize on the EV rush, and put a far enough date on it that they could scrap it in a couple years without too much blowback. But the question remains what will Tim Apples ‘iphone’ moment be, if he ever has one? Theyre at the top now but they could pull an intel if they get complacent, and true its pretty hypocritical, although Apple stock would tank within seconds if they announced domestic manufacturing.
They suggested shares for BB, but I think they're expecting it to keep going up for a long time.

I'm trying options with GME to really get something from the squeeze. I'm broke so using shares wouldn't get me shit. PLTR scares me lol
Or just open a leap spread

Dude, if you get margin called, your broker will sell your shares off. Just buy as much as you can in cash.
The big short sellers have deeper pockets than us. We just have to run em dry by holding
imagine if funded an account with a cash advance, then bought gme on margin :)
You should try reading the manga. The pacing is way better. There’s also one pace that removes the unnecessary drags. Apparently Wano arc anime is better with the pacing.

Actually that one worked out so well for me. Exited when shares were near the dip bottom (like $269 or $270). My $250 puts paid out so well. Only reason I sold was to buy something else from this forum.. bought a $200 put which obvs crashed and burned.
Yup I already have plans and many others I know do as well, getting into travel is the way to go
I don't think the upside for GME is that great.

This is a company, not in control of their own destiny, that needs to go through a successful business transformation in order to survive/thrive.

Is it possible? Well, yes, it is. GME has great brand recognition. People will pay attention to them because of their history.

On the other hand, so do the established players in the digital distribution space. Assuming GME can deliver technically - which is not a guarantee - where do they fall vs. Steam, EGS, and the online stores for the console manufacturers?

With all of the potentially positive news about ways they can avoid going out of business, I think it is justified that they are above the low point they reached not that long ago. I don't think the company is worth the current share price however, and the thing about short squeezes is that they push the price beyond what traders would otherwise think is reasonable for the stock. Ie., it's hard to see upside for a stock that is hitting the doldrums after a short-squeeze.
Bought a thousand worth of spy puts an hour before Trump announced the stimulus checks. Half the money from my dad. Changed by life by making my dad never trust me again. Told him “you never hear about the people who made millions during the depression🚀🚀🚀”
Essentially yes.  WSB is hoping for a squeeze but caught a stock that is undervalued and may actually have a good transformational story.

I honestly liked seeking alpha until they recently started coming out with anti GameStop articles that fail to mention multiple key topics.

It and PLTR are the only stocks I see WSB actually recommending shares (not following the  rhetoric of BB gang, though, maybe they are). Each have their reasons for it. For GME it’s the short squeeze, and for PLTR it’s because it’s traded sideways for two months. Not a great pick for gutsy options.

Ok. Coming onboard monday morning. $10 to $20 by noon!
Good info. I’d be surprised if they haven’t used it yet. Those insider sales may have been needed before they could activate it, then they did right after? Would be smart
Until you’re 40? This sub made you realize you can go 45 years without income? That’s hilarious. Maybe 2% of posters here have made gains that high. And that’s counting the fact that only top gains hit anywhere near front page. Most of the losses go unnoticed.

I was just thinking AR/VR could be Tims Iphone if they make something next gen, would love to see something like that. And I can see that being the case, Steve just killing it and making it seem so casual, no ceos did it better (that I know of) but it also helps he had such a gamechanging product.
It will have circuit breaks to 100 then fall some but you cannot deny the ev euphori, I’ve got calls in every month
Yup. Squeeze aside, the current price is much closer to what its value should be, based on GME's fundamentals. It was only kept artificially low by shorters. And with DD coming in about the different changes they're making, there's non-negligible growth potential moving forward
Suppose SEC GONE ROGUE!
Is this serious? So are you saying everyone should literally open sell limit orders for as many shares as you own @ 420?
Damn what a fucking couple of dickholes. Glad u made  it out

I see no reason why people wouldn’t buy them before inauguration.
Shorts don't expire.  You can hold them as long as you are willing to.  They normally only hold them as long as they think they will make money doing so. If the are actively losing money via large price increase and borrowing cost it becomes more likely they will want to exit that position.

Think of it this way.  You have $1000.  You short something $100.  It goes up 50%.  You are now down $50 but think you are still correct and short it $200 more.  It goes up 50% more, now you are down $125.  Short always have more money. They don't put it all in on the first short.  They will sometimes add more positions as they know panic selling is like a dam.  Sometimes a red day and a big push it all it takes to drop it 10 to 20%.  Do that several days/weeks in a row and the technicals start to looks like a decline stock and long sell to exit bad positions and they win.

Good info mate, really appreciate it and keep it coming. 

Some of these comments only confirm that the top is in. Bulls had 100’s of reasons the market was just fine a week before the dot com crash.
Seeking Alpha puts out a whole article bashing Gamestop about how it's a failing company, blah blah blah. Mentions WSB multiple times, saying the only way we make a difference if we are all going to stores buying merch. Then ends the article with "maybe the brand has more value thank I think". These people actually get paid for this shit.

Margin bad
Wait I’m new here, can I still buy GME or is it too late?
Last I checked that call had a delta of 0.55 so he'd only be controlling 165 shares as of right now. But I agree with you. I've split my position between shares and LEAPS
But unlike the casino and chips, shorters need to pay interest when they short. If they keep holding on they'll bleed dry, so there'll be a point in time where actually giving up and covering makes more sense than paying interest through the nose.

For us, holding shares is free (aside from opportunity cost of FDs) so we just need to stay in the game. We should all buy and uninstall RH for two weeks or something
Some people think anything that isn’t gme and rockets is bearish fud. I am short but not for these reasons. If I was relying only on these reasons and had to choose, I’d be long. I would end my short though if for example it was nearing 40.

Lol, I only bought one. If Ford gets past $15 by then and is continuing to improve, then I will buy the shares. If not, it's a very, very small loss. $72 downside, unlimited upside if they clean house and somehow produce a quality EV in Mexico - promising (insert sarcasm).  Ford is a dinosaur, unions are the comet, and boomer pensions are the dust cloud that will choke out their nourishment while simultaneously freezing them out of existence. The Farley pop is probably just CNBC being told to push the story so their players can plan an exit strategy and get back some of the money they've tucked down in the bowels of that sinking ship.

Aal is probably the worst positioned of all the carriers.
Starting with big numbers makes it easier to end up with bigger numbers
Its not two separate propositions though. Good news of the company's future plans and fundamentals would likely help amplify any squeeze that does happen, and a squeeze will alleviate the company of pressure from the massive amount of shorts present.
A lot of exercising calls and selling the shares. Pretty much all the meme stocks have high options volume so wsb likely saw a lot of red.

Steve Jobs came out with pretty much everything Apple sells today. It’s more than just the iPhone. 

As to the iCar, you can look up project Titan. It’s not new and it’s not going anywhere. If they’re gonna only focus on the software (AI), good luck  with that. I won’t trust Siri driving me anywhere. Again, the car is a stunt or a Hail Mary. Tim Apple can’t think of anything truly disruptive. On top of it, there is the hypocrisy of the new social initiative from a guy drawing his high margins from slave labor.

So damn wrong, it’s the events that happen within time that heals the wounds, if events are stagnant with time ticking away no healing occurs.  You have to be proactive about enhancing the positive experiences in your life to heal your own wounds.  Start small, it maybe and should include outdoor physical activity, just walk around the park, the mall say hi hello to strangers just a couple of mins. a day, make a commitment set it to paper and follow through, regardless of how terrible the day went.  Then gradually increase your activity but social safety net is key, then father time will work his wonders but only if you initiate it!  We’re here for you!

Nah Ironyman literally managed to change a platforms trading options and probably walked away with his money doubled since RH was too embarrassed to go after him.
I would put a high sell limit in case it pops and also to discourage your broker from lending them to shorts
So far I've lost money on BB bout to be depressed cus I wasn't even in the trading game for gme
A better but more active strategy would be setting stop loss orders. As it reaches new highs, cancel old stop loss orders and set a higher one. So if it mooned to 200, set a stop loss at 150-175. If you diamond hand hoping for 300, but it instead tumbles, you’ll capture your tendies without bag holding all the way down. If it kept going up, you could cancel and set a new one at 200-225. Rinse and repeat.
So wait. Fitbit got acquired by google which made my FIT 1/15 8 calls vanish. Will APHA share the same fate? 🥴
Good luck... it’s extremely manipulated

Same! I had been feeling pretty good about my boring indices and the market growth last couple of years as my NW has steadily climbed, but now am feeling like I missed a lot of alpha by not finding this board earlier—and this year especially! I only started following in December when I finally had some vacation and free time from my otherwise exhausting job. Now it seems chubbyFIRE goals can achieved even sooner. 

Still need to sift through the wheat from the chaff but with some healthy skepticism, the suggested investments here are a good place to start. We will see how shit hits the fan when the bull market ends but at least for now, I’m all aboard!

But out of curiosity and in all seriousness...theoretically, if a bunch of people were to agree on setting a sell limit at a certain price, and it did so happen to reach that price, and a lot of shorts were burned due to this..could they take legal action against “collusion” or something like that of said people?

Agree the politics are going to push wind over solar for utility scale installations in the US long term, and pushing more blue collar jobs in red states is one way. But ultimately, the way I see it, the dominant renewable is going to be wind because it's the cheapest one, and it has competitive advantages in not being as limited geographically as solar and being potentially productive at all hours.
Probably going to be less effective, still worth it?

Very refreshing to have these well thought out perspectives. I’m 90% in GME and very bullish but if you’re downvoting good DD because it goes against your cult mindset then you are actively reducing the quality of this sub.

Banks are basically covering their ass in case GME moons. They know.

Why do you have such a narrow view, the big European oil majors are bigger into renewables than tesla, and gold is far from the only commodity, uranium, silver, natural games and oil is super undervalued right now, this sub has told its self stories that if bonds suck then p/es of over 200 are acceptable and thats just not true.

I ran into this same situation. Sold off all I had to watch it take off the next day, so I'm slowly hoping to get back in with a stronger position before the 26th. Not holding my breath.
This is actually helpful info, I thought the IPO investors were completely locked up. I think I'll buy a grand or two, worth of PLTR at open Tuesday and then the dip pre expiration. Hopefully, the autists are right, and this shit really does blow up in a year or so.
I been watching since Aug when I noticed 122% institutions owned and over 100% shorted. Ran up and everyone said there is the squeeze only to see update s/I market watch climb rinse and repeat every 2 weeks since and I still don't fully understand.

It’s more that shooting into the low 40s is easier than shooting into the high 20s. The 39/40 ramp is a bit stronger than the 20 ramp. But you need selling or buying to get there in the first place. 35 itself should be volatile as a price.

Thank you for your reply!

I feel as though gme is structured on hopes that a few people sell certain things and hold onto things whereas bb is structured on actual business direction and position. Is that right? Seems you stand to win more in a short time with gme, whereas bb is more long term?

If I could ask another question. If I told Robinhood to buy 3 shares of gme already (I did 🚀), it’ll buy them when the market opens Tuesday? Should I cancel the order and wait 15-30 minutes before purchasing on Tuesday morning? What if the shares are not available at the price I bought them at?
I think so

I don’t think those are apples to apples. Overstock had a giant black swan hit it, rendering their business way more relevant.

In this case, there’s an investor black swan (wsb meme) but the company before this was an oversold value stock with a cash cow path potentially available. Not really the same thing.

As for the shorts, they are mostly institutions I think, and institutions risk manage systemically. They just won’t be in a position they can get truly screwed. They are definitely losing money. But they should be managing position size as they go if they are proper hedge funds and whatever. Hedge funds... hedge.

What is the scenario it goes down, paper hand sellers? Is that the only risk? I'm tard but the shorts have to cover right? There's no out other than them buying the shares.

I think this MOASS idea is incredibly short sighted and has the potential to leave a lot of people disappointed on both the long and short side.  

For maximum tendies, I'm 💎✋🏿🤚🏿until it hits 694.20, 420.69 is just too low of PT.  RC isn't a corporate raider like Icahn that just wants a quick 3X.

Yeah, id google those words. U dint seem to know what they mean at all.
That's because PLTR is newly public.  Find an equity that is 90% off a high from a year or two ago.  You'll find cheap LEAPs.  And you can piss your money away buying them.

because a party (Melvin) doesn’t like the way hów a company (Nintendo) works in the market and therefore it ‘attacks’ with shorts on the stock market that company?

I got my initial understanding from Google searches, subs like r/options, and just searching on YouTube to find popular videos on buying options.

There's good content at broker sites like tasty trade, e*trade, and tdameritrade.

Here's a good starter from E-Trade: https://us.etrade.com/knowledge/library/options

It can take a few readings or views to really grasp them, but only because they're new to you. 

There can be a ton of complications to options and a fair amount of math, but just like we don't have to know every financial detail of a company or be a chart master to know how to buy stock lower and sell the stock higher, we also don't initially need to know every detail about call options to begin trading with them.

Just keep exposing yourself to them through self education and it'll start making sense.

You can also hit me up if you have any specific questions and I'll do my best to explain things further or point you to something specific.

To relate
I love how Peter Lynch talks about his stock finds from 1980s in his book. He's like "so I found this company growing 30% per year, with a P/E of 7 and dividend yield of 12% so I bought a bunch of shares". Good luck finding anything near that these days. Any company that shows 5% growth gets a P/E of 35+.

lmao backstory?
Oh man I forgot what sears was supposed to mean
Doesn't seem to have been said, I'm just gonna point out that PC hardware has virtually 0 profit, especially retail where their tiny stores can't hold anything. Same as how consoles have no profit so they can take in game sales (not much there either, used is where they make bank). If they somehow did manage volume sales, they don't have room for cases where the box is the size of 4 consoles but only worth $60-200 (probably the most profitable part). If they do this you're getting roughly 3 options per part, probably a single brand.

I suppose they can guide you through and get everything from a warehouse withing a few days? But there's no way in hell for them to break into the market right now when established companies can't stock graphics cards

Ahhh this sub has its own damn language, that's for sure.

Excellent breakdown of cognitive biases in play. I think as much as people can view the “negative” in this, they should read it and realize that there are times that they lost that have little to do with their skill. Markets are random no matter how much analysis and TA people do, and we can only make bets and keep playing. The key is to lengthen the time horizon and bet correctly proportion wise to catch big wins.

don't know why people think downvoting simple rationalizations about the stock market will alter the reality. I guess it's more of a coping mechanism to make themselves feel better about seeing -99% on their 1000c's
Unless you take specific action your broker will lend them anyway you may as well get paid.

So, in conclusion the chance of it going down below 34.01$ is lower than its going up higher than 36?
Look up the ratio of APHA to TLRY that they will combine at and then determine current ratio and buy the one that’s under that ratio. If the current ratio is higher buy APHA, if it’s lower buy TLRY

Once you get rich, a smart man would just buy some boomer stocks and collect dividends till they die. If op took his account and dumped it all (9.3m) into Pfizer, he could collect $395,250 in dividends each and every year.

Pretty much everything I buy here tanks, so I quit coming a few days... then something like GME or pltr happens so I fomo into the next thing like BB and get fucked buying at the top.

So are 2/19/21 $BB $16 Calls and $GME shares going to make up my whole portfolio on Tuesday? 


Yes 🚀 🚀 💎
Last week I bought a basket of 10 liquid p-stocks with £500 in each and didn't touch them other than setting some sell limits to catch any sneaky pumps before dumps. The gains outweighed the losses by some margin, but it was just luck. My focus stayed on my normal day trading.
Agreed. Talk to me anytime you feel like it man. I want to hear what youre going through
Most people don’t do shit
Yeah, I think Overstock shorts couldn't see COVID coming and the impact on shopper behaviour or other macro factors. GME shorts are in a similar position, there is a lot of asymmetrical risk they're exposed to now.

Is there a signal to you that GME shorts are protected in a way that Overstock shorts weren't? That was my question as my understanding was you believe the shorts have already de risked.

yeah IV actually very high probably wait till after
Can we make a thing called "OPEN gang 🚀🚀🚀🚀"
Never your first house outright. Saves on taxes to pay it off over time
Agreed. Although, I’d felt they ripped me off when I sold my PS1 games to them way back when, I understand profit margins now so no hard feelings. In fact, still my go to place to buy games and chotskies when I’m back in North America, and I actually only have nostalgic feelings about the store and brand. I understand Amazon’s business model, and I’d bought from them too but I have no respect for the monopoly now (walmart killing mom&pop Main Street all over again). Hoping this isn’t a Shkreli play and that Cohen pulls a CHWY.

(I’ve since retired to the Philippines, out in the province, so we have internet speed issues and data caps. If GME could ship internationally I’d be down with ordering console games from them and they’d likely be more competitive with the obvious lack of domestic offerings, and it’d be a win for their suppliers too since it opens up new markets for them. The brick & mortar draw down and online move and product line expansion is an obvious and critical evolution, all the more given the state of the world.)

Edit: some words
Oof lost a lot on this one last year but seriously seeing it at $6 makes me want to get back in
I can tell you from experience that it’ll take some trial and error before you find the right therapist.
Yes if you sold it, found a dip, and bought it makes sense. That’s very challenging to predict in these conditions except maybe the option thing I mentioned that happened Friday. Milder next week unless prices move a lot.

Have you ever looked at the NOK chart? It's not new. It's not exciting. And it's sure as as hell not going up by 250%.
[removed]
specially now that banks are allowed buy backs
You'll be downvoted to hell for stating the obvious. But yeah, when things are going down, either bet on the down movement or buy value, or both. Perma bear or perma bull is the best way to stifle your potential returns.
It is more capital efficient for me to short the put then to buy the call for GME share as they don’t let me buy on margin. It’s 100% cash only.

Yeah that blew me my mind too.  At first glance I was like damn he had a catastrophic loss on that day but it’s only like 5% for him.  Crazy.
Hedge with some $110 put LEAPs

This is the simplest most to the point answer and example for shorting I’ve ever come across.

remember, this too shall pass
That is pretty weird. I have a pretty cordial relationship with my ex wife but I would never go to her wedding lol.
!remindme 14 days
Cause’ you have 40:1 leverage, and if say cathie adds it to arkx in march, 6 weeks holding a leap could return 40-80% easily with basically no downside for a small portion of ones portfolio. I bought 25 of these a few days ago for ~$330. In 2 months itll either still be about 300 or possibly 1-2k. Only 0.5% of my portfolio so i figure why not. They’re putting 4g on the moon - even if that doesn’t mean shit it makes hype
Would you buy pltr calls for end of this month of beginning of February?

Right, I mean like if you look at second quarter and first quarter of this past year the revenue was down over 100% and profits were done over 100%.

Just knowing the company has intimately I do, I'm pretty sure the EPS is not going to be met, but they may meet or be expectations on revenue. What that tells you is that claims are being filed and they're getting slammed on loss ratios across the board

Yeah you gotta think like the seller. When I sell options it is for a ridiculous price that you're like if this prints I would be surprised not mad, and then invest the collected premium. You want to be buying the option that has like a 1% chance or less of working to win out.
Down 15k all time, but up 5k this week!
Buffer is like 1k right now. (Got 6k overall) so might sell 500 or 1k maybe for that buffer. I'll really have see how it goes on Tuesday. I'm sure the shorts are going to short even though it would be illegal to.

It's very important to understand that when Melvin does a short sale on the equity they are essentially selling non existant shares to then open market trying to drive the price down...its an expensive manipulation strategy. Also, when they sell puts, MMs need to hedge which also drives the price down.

TLDR, there is no price target. If we all put sell limit orders at 420, then that's the price target. That's the price Melvin has to pay to close their shorts.

Theta gang enters the chat
You mean like a private share transaction from their big bank buddies? It's possible, but you won't find many people talking about a rational bear perspective here in r/wsb. I'm seeing too much confirmation bias with "DD" this weekend and no one's really asking why institutional short sellers have not bothered to cover or even trim since $4. They could have a safety net like this in their exit strategy

I'd say the bear perspective on GME right now (that isn't just blockbuster 2.0) is that GME has reached its fair value. You're not just up against short sellers, you're also up against value investors taking profit since they're not gambling on a speculative short squeeze. Fundamentals on Gamestop have not been proven yet (remember that even Party City posted a profitable Q3, GME cannot use COVID as an excuse for not pivoting fast enough). Any upside beyond this point comes from hoping that short sellers will buy your bags for you in a short squeeze

The problem is, there's no reason institutional short sellers would purposely cover themselves into a short squeeze. They have collateral in the billions and there's absolutely no risk of getting a margin call on their GME short position. Big funds could also just hold for years since they pay lower borrow rates than the spot rate you see on IBorrow or whatever. That leaves only retail short sellers or FOMO/momentum traders to be left holding the bag.

I'd say the retail short sellers have already been squeezed the past few days based on the volumes. WSB is going a bit crazy this long weekend so Tuesday should open high, but it could just be a repeat of November 30 if profit taking overwhelms the covering from the few retail short sellers still left in GME
From what I've gathered in the past couple of weeks, **buy shares**, not calls for GME.

Has anyone looked at the monthly chart. Isn't it almost at the top?
Yeah, the key point is that when you lend out your shares, you don’t have any shares anymore! It’s like when you lend 1000$ to your friend, you don’t have that 1000$ anymore, so you won’t be able to lend it to anyone else who is in trouble before you get it back from your friend first!

GME is not gonna follow this chart unless Cohen comes out on monday and announces "Dear Shorts: you are all fucked", cuz that is exactly what Porsche did before the spike.

On the upside, tuesday gains looking pretty safe! Shorts can only try to drill when the price moves up. They can't drill down like they did last week.

Right, but that's a terrible analogy. Epic/tencent, Microsoft, Nintendo, Sony - they produce the games, so they can choose where to sell them, they also control where people play them.

Dog food companies don't have this leverage. Look at PC games. As soon as downloading became convenient, people switched to steam, origin, uplay etc. No pc games are sold physically any more, and only a handful of websites outside the major platforms sell them digitally, very rarely triple a titles.

On top of that we're seeing gaming as a service boom. Microsoft gamepass and Google stadia being his examples. Unless Gamstop can build themselves into a platform and publisher they can't compete long term, or if they can survive it will be as a much smaller company.

Don't get me wrong, GME says under valued for a long time, and this trend will take another 5-10 years to play out, but eventually that risk needs to be priced in.

Honestly you are wrong here the margin requirements for the day it was $17 and the day it was $30 were the same because it happened in the same trading session and i know for a fact i was offered a fuck ton of margin to do stuff as my positions increased in value.  


My point was if they are changing the margin requirements and people were jacked to the tits like a bunch of retards, they will get margin called or forced to liquidate regardless of the underlying value, if that happens to enough people or the shorts attack at a well timed moment, it will drive the value of the underlying down and cause a cascading selloff.

I'm autistic and went all in LOL. I guess I should sell like 30% of the margin shares as a barrier net in case.
Real talk- I'm expecting earnings to be down because premiums have gone down due to less demand in the P&C market- even with London being a hard market for premiums right now, I think covid-19 has really affected the market dynamics. Last quarter it's operating income was down 28% and I probably expecting somewhere the same again.

These guys are actually fucking retarded- they work in a couple specialty healthcare markets and they're closing down even when the loss ratios are really low. But they're keeping their stupid ass travel business which lost them of fuck ton of money

they're concerned that with their healthcare plans being marketed as covering covid-19, because they do, they're going to get a lot of regulatory scrutiny. but since they're canceling these programs anyway, they're going to already get fucked by The regulators when policyholders start putting in complaints to Pennsylvania state

''Oh no, but I'm not like that, I love her blablabla'' Blinded by love huh? Can't blame you I guess, but it's dumb when you stand a 50% of divorcing anyway
But that is one person one time.  There are plenty of hand holding places online from pcpartpicker/YouTube/Reddit.  The crowd they should be after are the people who are hooked, constantly upgrading parts, adding rgb, upgrading keyboard/mouse multiple times.  There’s never enough ssd space, always more ram, more everything.  New $800 gpus every year.

I just can’t imagine an apple store genius bar format appealing to anyone besides parents once maybe every four years.  Then in two years they want a new graphics card... they should just have a hundred at launch, not this ideal the $799 pc they were sold is obsolete.

Best Buy went pretty hard at pc parts over the last couple years and I think it’s working because people want that stuff that day.  They don’t want help to have it shipped to their house for a premium when the help is already free

what are you thinking?  i got some IBM puts.  thinking about nflx but might be too late is they dump on earnings tuesday.
options sure, but prevent retail investors from buying a stock to short squeeze hedge funds, i doubt that. 

SEC is pretending they are all about retail investor protection. they could at max make brokers not allow you to have more than 20% in a single stock in your portfolio or some BS like that

Those lower margin requirements were only really available at considerably lower prices, though. 

Sure, there might have only been a 40% margin requirement when GME was at $8. At that point, a person would have been liquidated around $5 if they maxed out margin... If they still have that position, that's an even lower point than a margin long with a 75% requirement from $43 would be, though. 

What I'm saying is that we won't see a long squeeze on this until $15 at the absolute earliest.
[removed]
How about 2 really big ones? How else will I stretch it to the max?
Use a cash account for gods sake. I have 2 accounts for that reason and one is TD. They at least will remove the PDT 3 times a year if you really mess up and get restricted

Edit and I have margin on TD so I can trade futures
Why would I miss out on a once in a decade opportunity to cash out? This isn’t an average play. It has way higher potential. 

I’m fine taking the risk on this play and then getting back to working the market normally. Anyone who’s too afraid to Diamond hand this GME play is perfectly fine to sit on the sideline and cash out for 3k. I’ll hold in an attempt to get 50-100k. If it works it works. If not, oh well, I’ll cash out for like 2k
[removed]
You should look at your margin situation and figure out what you want to do and can do. If gme is only a moderate or small part of your portfolio and you aren’t running margin really aggressively you probably have no issue

Hello my name is Alex Karp 🙋🏻‍♂️ I enjoy long walks on the beach and dumping shares on wsb autists
That poor guy got bukkake'd by WSB.
That was a rough day...
Oh shit you’re right 😕 Damn!
What book did you buy?
hypothetical q - would a WSB summit be in NY or Las Vegas?
I  had been holding PLTR since IPO and gradually bought more at dips for a $15.97 cost average.  I've held over the weeks hoping it would break the wedge but finally sold yesterday at $27.34 for a 70% profit.  

Now hopefully it falls back to the $24.xx range and I'll buy back before Demo Day and sell again around earnings and before the lockout period ends.  Then wait for the dip from all the new shares and buy back for the long term.
Initial public offering - Company sells stock to the public at 2 dollars a share. Makes 10 million dollars.

3 years later, stock is 44 dollars.

Company does another public offering and sells new stock for the new price of 44 dollars. Company makes a billion.

Also the GME wants to appease large share holders holding significant % of the company because those are their big dick investors. Screwing that many rich people over is very bad for buisness. 

Does that make sense?
Cardio burns fat right?
Obama loved blackberries. Biden loves obama. Therefore...
That’s amazing, use it wisely. It go al in on GME! Haha

No, all of what you paid for the contracts. Theta will eat it over the life of the contract so if you're not in the money at expiration you just lose what you paid for the contracts.

Yeah you really have to just take it weekly and go with the flow.  But to your point look at what all the banks did all shining er but every lot of them tank because they’ve already had their run up, then there’s delta lmao beaten down pos with layoffs to no recovery in sight end in sight which is why the beaten downs shall rise.
Hell yea I'd sell them at market open. Then buy dips throughout the week.

If I wanna buy more, is it worth waiting until next week for a low price or is the premium now worth the avoidance of risk?
Overstock had coronavirus tailwinds though didn’t it?
There are plenty of examples when companies do a share offering and the stock explodes up bc the balance sheet is strengthened with the cash influx - don’t assume GME would trade down for too long, in fact it may be what is needed to truly get the squeeze going

If the ETFs are lending shares, those borrowers are selling in the float. These institutions also own retail long shares, retail buys and sells all the time. Plus, many retail shares are being lent anyway.

Welcome, comrade 🚀🚀
RKT towards the ground
Get a damn job so you can actually make some plays. Don't get too much into calls though until you really think you understand them. It's easy to lose all your money, at least with shares you still have something even if it tanks. I'm guessing you're young. Focus on buying shares of companies you believe in, and throw in a fun yolo call every once and awhile. But if you start young, collect shares, and leave your money in the market you're going to be set. You can also hedge against your shares, buy a put a year out on a company you own a good buy of stock in. If the price tanks you can cash in the put and put it right back in at the low price if you're still bullish on the company.
[deleted]
GME from november until last week. Rip to everyone who bought calls then (especially at earnings)
It’s infinite squeeze. Literally having a cash cow for the next year.
Great DD. I bought some 130 March calls which have been swaying up and down but I'm pretty confident they will print when we get closer.
Ok
FYI The top is in when people will say they will eat shit if a stock goes up by $10.
Yeah, I’ve been reading on it some and not quite understanding it that well, that’s why i figured I’d ask before i go and do something stupid. Lol
as in 100% the strike price when the call contract was made? sorry for the stupid questions im completely new to all this
This is calculating current margin requirements, but if the margin requirements are changing, lets say that you initially purchased on a 60% margin requirement and now it requires an extra 15% or like the discussion states that it could potentially increase to 100% for some people.

If you had 25% of your shares on margin you will need to pay that difference.

If you had a large position you may be forced to put a ton of capital into your account or liquidate some of your position to cover the margin requirements.

Correct me if i am wrong but what i am saying is its not as simple to say what the current situation is, this is in regards to all the people who have already bought on margin or for your example say we go long on Tuesday at 75% margin requirement and we use the margin we have available for 1000 shares.

We are purchasing $43,000 worth of stock and $10,750 of that is on margin and the rest ifs your cash. Now they change the margin requirements to 100% and you need to deposit that difference of $10,750 right now or sell your shares.  


That does not even account for a change in the underlying value of the stock!

You do realize Wall St. doesn’t think short term right? Banks and investors in the fixed income world want higher yields and better investment opportunities. They like globalization and investments into new areas (renewables, tech, infrastructure, etc). Why would they back Trump who has isolated the US and ruined trade relations with other nations. Of course they are going to back him. Not every mofo on the street cares about what max gains they can get from taking leveraged positions on non profitable companies. That’s hedge funds. Sure IB, hedge funds and a few other groups are prospering but for the most part it’s not stable long term. Biden was the best option of the candidates that made it through the prelims.
Ya this guy never passed 2 tho. Switched majors

Why did MARA dip harder than RIOT? I thought they effectively did the same thing.

Not OP but this is the coolest tool ever, thanks!
That's how I understand it. I think since it's in effect for 2 days (day it's triggered plus the next trading day) and we are in a period of generally positive sentiment on the Cohen news, people are assuming it means rocket. I think people are also expecting (too much, IMO) the a MOASS will happen immediately and violently. I'm a believer in the slow squeeze on marginal positive earnings and operational change announcements.
What are your passive investments? Need good recommendations please!

Or distract them with other retarded plays so they don't realize how good they have it figured out. They want us to throw money at other plays to keep the buying minimal so they have a chance to cover. If we actually keep up the play we will win, and we will be richer when the next play comes up.

No. You can spend the same on calls as you do with shares. In terms of GameStop by the way just buy shares. Buying shares helps move the needle higher to trigger the squeeze.

Why do the google and apple stock charts show it up 8% on Friday even tho it fell?
This aged well.
It's an ETF, will rise steadily and not moon overnight. You have a higher chance to be fucked. Hopefully you won't be.
Because of the 75% margin requirements, a maximum of 25% of shares in a margin position can be on margin. This means that 75% of shares in any given position must be owned outright. 

If 75% of shares are owned and 25% of shares in a position are borrowed, that means that even a position that was opened at max price on Thursday would still have some inherent value until $10.75. 

As long as the position has inherent value (and a client isn't playing with "house money"), the long position won't be liquidated.

Even though China is rolling in bank, I don't understand their culture enough to have confidence in what I am buying. Plus over the longterm, businesses are slowly shifting supply chains to India (won't happen any time soon, but their moving). I'd rather buy stressed American and western European companies I am confident will come back, i.e. bout Boeing at $160. Financials are more likely to be accurate, more regulation, I can more easily understand how they fit into their respective culture, etc.

I mean, that's closer to 300k combined on those two I posted. Between those and the 700k you mention, that's probably why the available to short jumped to 1mil end of Friday. Regardless, that's still over 70mil sold short. That's what the paper hands don't understand. GME gang is Gucci soon

Options have more risk. Especially if you buy weeklies because at the expiration date if GME is $39 and calls are for $40 you wasted money. $36 calls will be less of a risk but also more expensive initially. As for the rest I recommend looking on YouTube, there are a lot of helpful channels

We’ll know if covering is really happening if the short interest begins to drop as price and volume starts to ramp up - one of the autists on here will likely report on that when it starts happening.

PT expectations are anyone’s guess. The VW infinite squeeze case study only gives us an idea of what happens in an infinite squeeze from a mechanical standpoint, setup was different. And, although at the height of that squeeze it was $1000/share I don’t think anyone knew it could get that high. Same issue with Shkreli’s KBIO infinite squeeze.

I got 4 calls, gonna use the short float to guess where we are while going over this mountain if that’s possible: thinking of unloading 3 on the way up (starting after 60-70% cover) and the last on the obvious way down,. Might buy a couple more on the spike up too. Just hoping this is drawn out over a week so there’s some space and time but given the stock will need to to be bought and sold 3 times over to cover the short interest (or more if the available float is even lower than we thought) could be longer.

Some possible left field shenanigans: what if melvin goes to one of the institutionals and asks to buy out their etf holding at a certain price and they agree (I think that may have already happened with one of the larger retail funds on stocktwits that was pumping on twitter whose name I forget, guy subsequently deleted all his DD and pumping). What if Cohen decides to issue more stock (but I think he wants to kill the shorts like we do, less people betting against the turn around after this is done). Is it possible for shorts to acquire shares during the squeeze to spam down the bid (would anyone lend? would there be any shares to lend? Could they even naked short again? This didn’t happen in VW or KBIO so probably unlikely).
Hopefully you can use PLTR gainz to support yourself to write full time a couple years

I clearly just proved you could using actual data and a real world example. 

So again, you're a financially illiterate moron.
Dick is diamonds
is it really going to drop like that?

How long of a position, how actively are you tracking the stock’s bid/ask spread, do you have any time constraints, how much of a risk tolerance do you have, and how much toilet paper do you have for when you hit it big and need happy tissues or sad tissues?
I need to get off this sub.. I’ll be a broke man in no time 😂. GME TO THE MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
So why would anyone do this? It's like, why bag hold nonsense in a market that prints money everywhere.
My Bull case: 

Best Buy has a market cap of $27 billion and $49 billion annual revenue. GameStop currently has a market cap of 2 billion with 6-8 billion revenues yearly (but their online sales since Cohen hopped on board are up 309%) on fundamentals alone, cutting fat by closing stores, their excellent balance sheet this stock should double from here. Ryan Cohen to me is like Lebron James going to the LA Lakers. The lakers had zero hope, it was a questionable decision but after a year it paid off and the lakers came back during his sophomore season and won the title. Proving every single doubter and 🌈🐻 wrong. Any company worth its salt is only as good as the CEO. Ryan Cohens don’t grow on trees. If Elon Musk left Tesla evaluation would immediately drop. It’s like when Jobs passed away & then Tim Cook took over. We saw a dip. (And you can bet your ass Jobs would be doing a way better job than Tim Apple) Either way. GameStop just picked up a hot fresh talented brilliant CEO who went up against Amazon in direct competition & Succeeded. I’m fully sold and I wish I had been on board sooner. It’s seriously so clear to me now.
time will tell
Name doesn’t check out.
Don't forget about MRS.V, Americans will love that one.
I think it'll settle down and get absorbed into the FAANG "volatility board", becoming just another cog in the large cap correlation complex, but it has to catch up in size before it becomes a boring addition

We have nothing but time. I don't care if they try to suppress the price and it stays flat. I'll wait. Even if it goes down I'll be buying as many shares as I can with my next paycheck. 


In my eyes, absolute worst case it goes down to $20, I bring my average share price down buying more, and the price slowly goes up through the year as Cohen kicks ass. Literally can't go tits up.
In a recent year where the market went  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 . I had a broker pick 4 stocks at the start of the year. At the end of said year I owned 3 bankrupt stocks and another that was on life support. All of them in oil/energy. I sat out of the market for a while after that. I figure I can do better listening to the retards here or using a magic 8 ball. My hands aren't capable of opening. Retirement funds going in. Should be fun if nothing else.
I watch the market like a hawk during a week now. Have a newfound hate for weekends. Love mondays now. Learned about confirmation bias, etc. Wsb has made me less poor. Good times overall. Also, the creativity for memes has made me appreciate em more.

The gap is pretty fucking huge as well. But AAPL has long reached much more of an institutional staple status, which lends lots of sense to this discrepancy

I had a pebl for awhile. That thing was pretty cool
A stop loss order is issued below market price, and triggers if the stock falls to the price you set it at. So if GME mooned to 200, and you diamond handed it, you could mitigate risk with a stop loss order of 175 or something--so that it wouldn't fall all the way down with you holding the bag.
No one knows lmao

**[Sled](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sled)**

A sled, sledge, or sleigh is a land vehicle that slides across a surface, usually of ice or snow. It is built with either a smooth underside or a separate body supported by two or more smooth, relatively narrow, longitudinal runners similar in principle to skis. This reduces the amount of friction, which helps to carry heavy loads.  Some designs are used to transport passengers or cargo across relatively level ground.

Looks like some serious spread you got going on, I think your in good shape to print
Ur supposed to sell FDs retard, nobody is making a fortune on the 1/22 AAPL 150 calls I sold or the 290c babas lmao

WTF is this
Ready to double this tuesday and x10 by end of week bro
In terms of money being moved on average, TSLA is so far ahead of everything else, just did the math
I don't know I'm just a 23 year old who reads a fuck ton about useless information so, take what I have with a grain of salt.
I have 16 shares lol
You didn’t listen well then. He literally called out speculators on Wall St and said those who are making it off well in the pandemic should pay their fair share.
Not the guy you asked, but I have one example (sounds like what he was talking about, at least somewhat).  I have been trading TSLA since like 2015.  You would think I am a millionaire right?  Nope.

See what happens, is TSLA hits a new high, and then you sell your let's say 100 shares.   Welp, TSLA just keeps on going, so you buy back in, for like 99 shares.  TSLA goes up, you're like, this is the top for sure!  So you sell.  

Well, damn, what do you know?  TSLA fucking mooned this time.  Alright, let's get back on this rocket, wait...I can only afford 95 shares now, wtf?  Alright let's do this then, all in 95 shares!

Rinse, repeat, rinse repeat, and that's kind of what happens.
the market is open on monday
Watching a show called "how to live mortgage free".    It makes me want to kill myself.  They need to get some retards from wsb on that show.
It’s a DPO also not IPO
Pretty good return. How long did it take you?

Keep listening and buying into them. Subscribe now and I can tell you the next Tesla!
Dude, some ppl gonna have to sell out their wife or market goes down.
He could raise even more capital long term if he does the offering during the squeeze, instead of before/after.
Gunna be entirely honest. This is crack in the form of words. And I've smoked crack in the form of crack. I almost nutted reading this. This This This This Fucking THIS!! 

Ive been preaching the good word of GME to the peasants that I found myself bumping elbows with. As an autist a retard and a true tendie chaser im going balls fucking deep this week and im not pulling out.

and what are TPTB gonna do? prevent retail investors from buying stocks, so WS can make money on their shorts? hell GME is a healthy company with good plan, it aint Hertz meme. it simply does not compute. SEC put itself to corner when they say they are about retail investor protection lol
Just hold off two weeks, you addict lol
Who the fuck is having weddings and inviting randoms these days
100% agree. I've been telling people that when your in the market you weigh the risk vs reward on your play. Buying leaps or shares on GME is literally risk free. With a massive short float as your cushion and with you buying after they shorted GME into oblivion, there isn't a stock more discounted than this one.

Personally I yoloed all in GME awhile back and only kept buying as my paycheck comes in on days where it dips. I was playing the squeeze awhile back since Cohen was on the fence but since Cohen got what he wanted without needing to fight other board members publicly, I'm not selling anymore. Unless stock price goes to 694.20$ in the next few month without any more news.

where are you seeing this
You aren't going to be able to afford a gme call if you only have like $50. The more volatile a stock price is the higher the premium is. The option premium depends heavily on the stocks underlying IV (implied volatility).

Do you know if earnings are 1/28 or 2/4? Have they officially announced a date?
DPO not IPO could go more like PLTR than IPO or SPAC this makes me hopeful though lots of time to buy cheap
I am honestly torn.  I am thinking about putting a small amount on the Browns.  I don’t think I’ll bet on the NFC game.
so how do we know the hedge funds positions? do they have to publicize it with SEC so its public? and how do we know when are their shorts expiring?

Your sister needs to review and categorize her transactions on a regular basis ffs
I normally don't waste my time with idiots on the internet, but here we are. I'll post a real world example to show that you're a moron.

https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/1884-Woodbine-St-Flushing-NY-11385/32008968_zpid/?utm_medium=referral

The rent roll for this property is 76k a year not including the basement which you can either live in or rent over for another $1500 - $1800 a month. So total rent roll for this building if I'm not living in it is 94k a year on the low end.

Now let's do some basic yearly math. 

Taxes = $5846

Insurance = $6000

Water = $2000

Electricity = $2000

Total = $15,846

So now, $94,000 - $15,846 = $78,154 net income.

That leaves 8k to play with for repairs (spoiler: most buildings don't need anywhere near that much for yearly repairs)

Also keep in mind I just randomly pulled up a listing from Zillow because that's what is readily available, if you search with a local realtor you can find way better deals. Also "vacancies" is not a thing in NYC, there's literally a waiting list for apartments.

Lastly, I help my parents because that's what you're supposed to do for your parents, I don't get paid for it. I'm a highly desirable engineer in the IT field making six figures so no need to worry about my employment. 

In conclusion, you're a moron.
For real go boomer mode investments and move to Thailand.

Trading my calls for shares on Tuesday
how much money is realistically lost on a single call contract (which I understand to be 100 shares) if by 2/5 the strike price is not above 11$ and therefore 'worthless'. I've seen a lot of videos explaining but they all use analogies and theoretical prices, what is a realistic amount of money "gambled' on a call like the one we're talking about?

55 2/12 should print, I grabbed some 49c 1/22, because I think we'll see over 50 next week for sure, and we could even see 55 next week. The thing with XPEV is that it goes red for a few days, then it just explodes all in one or two days, then consolidates again for a few days, then explodes again, and so on. Right now it's gaining momentum again, with their new autonomous driving beta coming out, and earnings around the corner, idk its really a great setup.

Right, a company trying to change the world and expand as quickly as possible shouldn’t reinvest every single penny. You’re a idiot if you don’t realize why they’re doing what they’re doing.

Oh I game and have built PCs before.. not sure what that has to do with it.. I know that there aren’t many places left besides mostly online stores that provide pc parts and builds... and GME could easily fill that void as they have physical locations all across the nation. Is a serious PC person going to avoid grabbing some parts from GameStop if they have what they want available just because it’s GameStop, that’s a little hard to imagine. What about the folks who have no experience or the knowledge for building PCs but want to build their first one? I’m pretty sure there are way more people who are completely clueless when it comes to pc builds than serious pc experts. 

I mean if new consoles were solely pushing digital downloads they wouldn’t have made disk versions? But yet here we are, with both new gen consoles with disk drive versions. Why not just release only digital versions if nobody wants discs? 

If GameStop was to go under, don’t you think it would have went under in 2020 with the rest of the businesses that had to close thanks to COVID-19?

Looking at the prospectus, I don't see anything other than authorization to distribute 300 million shares. I've heard the 100m number before but I can't find anything to corroborate it here.
And then they will be competing with pc manufacturers as well as direct to consumer gaming pc brands such as ibuypower and origin.

Degenerated culture. Music doesn’t have soul anymore since anyone who actually wants to talk about real things is blacklisted from the industry. It’s just soulless look at me I have sex nonsense with the occasional Faux-corporate-accepted social commentary
this is just the [confirmation bias](https://www.reddit.com/r/options/comments/kyi9qe/thinking_about_wfc_calls/) I needed. I feel like stock buy backs, a removal of their Asset cap & slight interest rate increases are all on the table by end of year. 

Thoughts on a $40+ price target by September?
I don’t understand this, 
Can someone explain the point about long margin positions only closing a portion and the shorts having to close everything to cover the margin change?

If your long, you can sell your shares and you gain collateral? 

The shorts sell and they lose collateral? 

Collateral is an asset that has value. Shorts have no asset??

We don’t like JP Morgan because they’re part of the system that makes trillions of dollars and makes lots of money at our expense. That is changing now by popular demand.

Complaining about us rigging stocks? We are using public knowledge and coming to a public consensus. We have always been considered the “average” or “dumb” investor, but now that same group of people that they used to take advantage of is getting smarter with their money. Boo fucking hoo. 

This is why I advocate for the growth of WSB. Despite the crappy content that gets posted, there are diamonds in the rough here that can help these so called “dumb investors” that work 9-5’s get DD on companies that they wouldn’t have time to get, or for people who love trading and research to share their ideas and get validation or criticism. 

I’m all for public discussion of what is legal and illegal, but for these people to be so upset so quickly over this is extreme criticism in my opinion.
I would upvote it twice if I could

On the last call in DEC a $BAC rep (bank of America, a huge short holder) asked if management would offer more shares (keep in mind this was at $15) and Sherman shot him down with a super fast NO. 

They have a shelf offering of $100m and a buy back offering of (I'm probably wrong) $150m. This in itself seems oxymoronic and maybe illegal but it is not. It's a hedge either way. 

GME has big cash reserves, paid down a lot of debt, big increases in sales (and will for the next 2-3 years at least), low market cap compared to sales, a decent plan of action before RC joined the board, and a mysterious (but probably awesome) future by taking the direction of they guy who F'ed Amazon on pet stuff.

Fair value is probably close to $90 a share if you look at their book, sales, and future changes that could consolidate more of the gaming market under their roof.

A squeeze could happen, it might not, but the intrinsic value of $GME is very under rated right now, even with the pop last week. 

I think they will offer the shelf at $80. That's only 1.25m shares.. that's a damn drop in the bucket vs the short percentage.
I ordered a pull-up bar off of Amazon and it was clearly owned by someone else before me. The box looked like how a fat kid would quickly tear apart a candy wrapper. I don’t know how Amazon accepted a return like that. Then when I assembled the pull-up bar I could feel their finger indentions in the foam grips🤮 I’m returning this shit and going to Academy.

AMZN $2800P 1/22

ASO $30C 2/19
NFLX is weak they never make money and never will
ITS GME GAANG OR NOTHING
I'm glad we can agree on that at least, for both your sanity and mine haha. I've only been trading consistently for 3 years now and even for me this is insane, obviously never seen anything like it.
Absolutely. Poors like us need liquidity and have to dip in and out of the market. Takes way more balls to gamble with rent money than it does an extra 250K lying around
oh lol, i thought you were just that drunk
 Went from smug to homeless in a few short hours. Brutal.
We are all just buying shares and looking at all the same public information. 

It’s the guys like Melvin trying to manipulate the market by shorting over 120% of the float and then trying to drive down price.

We’re just investors and found a good deal in GME.
Yep
That’s the thing. Sherman and the old BOD were repeatedly saying they would announce plans for their business model in 2021 during the ICR and even said it during their Q3 conference call.

Then they silently change their industry presentation date at the ICR from retail 1/13 to technology 1/11. 

Then the Ryan Cohen assignment to BOD is announced premarket on 1/11 and then they pull out of ICR.

A plan is currently unfolding and it’s not GameStop’s old BOD that’s in control anymore. It’s the guy who turned chewy into a successful business. The guy who lives for these investment opportunities in the first place.
Friend from college refused to quarantine during all this and went out to bars, gyms, and restaurants with no mask.

Recently learned that he gets in trouble at Publix stores and posts about it on Facebook. Along with Bill Gates conspiracies.

Heard from a friend that he got himself real sick last weekend. Refuses to get covid tested. Heard he said that he knows it’s just a cold and just needs some Vicks chest rub. Feel bad for his roommates.

People wonder why cases are nearing all time high. We will not getting a beer together when things are better.

Johnson and Johnson better deliver vaccine tendies end of the month. Sick of being inside. Fuck.
How else will they learn? Once you touch fire you know to not do it again. Stop being so damn sensitive.

what kind of hillbilly retarded logic is this? There are companies behind the stocks of the top 9 legacy automakers too. You dont see them at 5000 despite being much more profitable than tsla

I'm down 60%. Since it was my pension my first goal is to get even, my second goal is to make an additional 10k so that I can withdraw my pension and put it somewhere long term like a Roth and use the 10k on things I want to invest in as well as on options. Then lose that of course.
I would be ok with this
[deleted]
Thanks, just getting into it so this is super helpful
I keep saying this. $2.5B valuation is stupid low, even compared to what the company is earning today, let alone if it’s transformed. In a few years, it’s gonna be a $300 stock and it’s not gonna be overvalued, or because of a short squeeze.
Bottom of GME was $4, how have you not made money if you’ve been that long?
No, he robbed a bank.
To inform the dumb fucks on here. Don’t worry. Won’t happen again lmao

It might be from Dec 31. Dec 31 2020 short interest was 71 mil, which was reported Jan 12. The next update is due to come out Jan 27 I believe, which will show up through Jan 15 2021. Sucks that it lags behind.

Wicked description and seriously clarified alot for me. I'm reading investing for dummies 5th edition and alot of this wsb jargon does not apply to a school lesson on investing, or its hard to cut through and grasp the real meaning. Haha thanks a ton
If I did id write an algo. 1M is enough to just boomer coast on mob on those sweet divvies.
exactly, maybe i'm getting off the train early, but i appreciate someone who has realism about how different everyone's goals may be. its not about how much money you bet, its about the % of what you have

dude there's too many fucking Discussion and DD posts of the same shit..
Yep. It’s a good time too since ICLN’s pulled back a little the last couple days. So premiums for Jan 2022 are a bit cheaper. 

Really depends on the option. It all boils down to when you wanna take profits, or if it’s not profitable yet when you’re willing to cut your losses.
You could have bought literally any weed stock call before the Georgia runoff vote and made 10x in a week
If that graph is anything closer to what gamestop might look like, god knows I might make some irresp..-retarded things in the coming days

Shorts AR FUK


Its that simple
You too will get to the point where $10k isn’t that much.
The 5G play has buried many of our autistic brothers here. Thousands have punted on this since inception. Think about it this way, with Huawei out of the picture and multiple governments pledging support for Nokia and Ericsson, why are prices still frozen across the year on one of the bullish rallies?
Apparently we are Activist investors now.
My problem with this strat is I get bored after 2 weeks and sell at a slight loss
im actually up on it right now, bought it at 0.25 and now its at 0.31, i also have 0.6 shares of PLTR that are up about a dollar too, i suppose if i sell all those i'd be able to buy 1.5\~ gme?  


to be honest, i am a literal autist, my rich boomer parents pay for me to stay alive, and they are doing fine in the markets so i just wanted to goof around with 50 bucks lol
I don’t know what you just said, but what does it mean for GME?

Scared money don’t make no money
You know what? I don't have time to read any of this shit. But I got inspired by our TSLA and GME diamond hand overlords. So on Tuesday morning I will go out and buy 10 contracts of the furthest out, highest strike calls and walk away for a few years.
Nani?!
I haven’t heard that name in goddamn ages....

Sad thing is I've been playing GME and TSLA since the bottom on both and haven't even made that much money. Shoulda just bought and held instead of trying to time the shit constantly

Intel earnings - might help AMD lol

If no shenanigans in politics and spy rebounds - look out for tech stocks which have been quiet since September ( nvidia / Amazon / Amd ) 

Earnings buildup might start for Apple - hit might be a week later too - same for Tesla 


GME shares considering the hype 

If Jack ma appears by any chance expect huge run up for baba

Growth stocks like SQ to be back on track 

Personal speculation- check if visa can rebound from the recent set back
Gattaca
Not so if the OTM puts weren't yours. If you're just standing on the sidelines and see a stock jump 78%, you might go short shopping.

The reception the banks and other investment firms (Blackrock) got this week has been very lukewarm. Goldman is up $100/share with since November 9th when they gapped up $10 on open that morning.

Plenty of people lost money on GME Friday. Only a few are brave enough to post the losses.

Sometimes you gotta get off when you've achieved what you need. He wants 2 months rent, I want to retire.
They’ve also got like 220 something patents with more on the way very long term play though
It’s going over.
That's why I'm saying why the fuck does anyone even care about what they say. They're all fucked.
People are weird with money. I was dirt poor 10yrs ago and made a change. Most of my friends the same age have maybe $5k saved in a Roth IRA... and that’s it. Still renting, no 401k, no savings. Jealousy is powerful, especially between friends and family. Stealth wealth is smarter IMO.

Read the dd here and make you best judgements. Can easily get 10%
10% every few days
Pro tip: Just skip to the bottom: Our MD simulation-based predictions of greater affinity of K484 S RBD for ACE2 as compared to E484 and the greater likelihood of altered conformation as compared to the original structure may represent mechanisms by which the new 501Y.V2 virus variant has been able to replace original viral strains. The enhanced affinity likely accounts for by rapid spread due to greater transmissibility and the likelihood of adoption of conformations not recognized by first-wave antibodies may explain escape of the virus from immunity to the original strain14.

The strong contacts seen for only the E484K mutant here suggest that spike may adopt a distinct ‘binding pose’ relative to other conformations. We further posit the differing PCA densities seen for the triple mutant that seem to result in lesser loop interaction with hACE2 as compared to E484K alone may be due to the other mutations. We will investigate this in depth in future studies.

The greater relative risk posed by variants expressing the E484K mutant as compared to the N501Y mutant alone is supported by Andreano et al. (in preprint)15 who co-incubated what they refer to as ‘authentic’ virus with highly neutralizing COVID-19 neutralizing plasma over several passages and saw the appearance of mutations including the E484K substitution which, in combination with an insertion in the spike N-terminal domain (NTD), led to complete resistance to the convalescent plasma. In contrast, Xie et al.16 (in preprint) reported that sera from 20 individuals that received the BNT162b2 mRNA vaccine showed equivalent ability to neutralize both Y501 and N501 SARS-CoV-2.

Additional support for the threat posed by mutations at residue 484 is provided by Greaney et al.17 who undertook an impressive effort to map mutations that affect binding of ten human monoclonal antibodies. By employing a deep mutational scanning method, they found that mutations at residue 484 have a high probability of affecting antibody binding. They further suggested their analytical method provides a tool for design of escape-resistant antibody cocktails to overcome the threat posed by viral evolution. We believe the MD simulation approach used here similarly represents a tool to be used in the arsenal against the continuing pandemic, as it provides insight into the likelihood mutations alone or in combination may have effects that lessen the efficacy of existing therapies or vaccines.

In vaccine design, it has been suggest that the makers of vaccines could keep up with viral evolution by continual alteration of the ‘payload’ - almost all vaccines in development use the spike sequence - to fit currently predominant strains. We suggest vaccines whose efficacies are largely dependent upon humoral responses to the S antigen only are inherently limited by the emergence of novel strains and dependent upon frequent re-design. In contrast, a vaccine that elicits a vigorous T-cell response that is far less subject to changes due to accruing mutations provides a better, more efficient approach to protection. The ideal vaccine would also deliver a second, conserved antigen such as the SARS-CoV-2 nucleocapsid protein, that very likely will elicit humoral and cell-mediated immune responses that will remain effective, even in the face of a rapidly changing virus.

Although not the subject of the investigation described here, we are developing a dual-antigen human adenovirus serotype 5 (Ad5) platform-based vaccine that delivers both a spike protein with a linker to increase cell surface expression and humoral responses (S-Fusion) and the highly antigenic and conserved nucleocapsid (N) protein with a signal sequence (an Enhanced T-cell Stimulation Domain, ETSD) to direct it to subcellular compartments that enhance MHC I and II responses18. It is our belief that the vaccine, hAd5 S-Fusion + N-ETSD, due to its ability to elicit cell-mediated in addition to humoral immune responses, as shown in both a rodent model19 and non-human primates20, offers hope to those regions such as South Africa wherein dangerous variants of SARS-CoV-2 have swept the country.

It's so bad that TOO MANY people bet against it. We are all betting that it's not THAT bad. And all the people who bet against it have to pay our inflated prices because it's not as bad as they thought. Basically it's the same reason black licorice is so damn expensive.

Sorry Melvin, tldr
bears gay bulls chads :) jokes aside bears want stocks to go down (look into puts and shorts), bulls want stocks to go up (obvious reasons, if youre a shareholder you want stocks to go up in value). In general, research what options are.
Not in the slightest.
Without getting into more complicated options, bull is someone who owns stock and bear is someone who is short stock. 

Being short stock is borrowing stock someone owns and selling it with the promise to return their stock in the future. 

Short stock example: I own a single share of a stock that costs $10 now, and you want to short it. So you borrow my share paying me 10% interest for the length that you borrow it, then you sell it for $10. Sometime in the future if it works out for you you buy the stock back at $8 and return it to me. Now you made $2 - whatever interest you paid me during that time. Where that goes bad is if you borrow at $10 and it goes to $15. Now you have to buy it back at $15 when you only got $10 for selling it so you used $5 of your own money to get the share to return to me.
Think of it like this，even if no vw squeeze it might very well go on a Tesla type squeeze...not hard to appreciate 8X from 2B...

"Shorting" a stock doesn't mean "buying puts". It's some confusing shit that you and I don't do. 

If GME is at $20 and you think it's going to drop, you borrow 1 share of GME from your broker, sell it on the market for $20, and then you sit around with your thumb up your ass waiting for it to drop. If it drops to $10, you buy 1 share of GME from the market for $10, give it back to your broker, and he gives you the $20 he was holding for you from when you sold that share you borrow from him. 

If the price suddenly jumps to, say $38, you might say "Oh shit, I don't want to short this stock any more, it's going to the moon!" You still have to buy a share of GME on the market for $38 to give back to your broker, and he still gives you back that original $20, but you just had to spend $18 of your own money to close your short. And buying shares makes the price go up, so maybe you just made somebody else panic and close their short position too. Etc

Makes one wonder..... is wsb right or all the funds that are shorting?
So, not to tell you how to invest, but if you really expect it to take off, then you'll get better returns with less capital buying far dated OTM call options.

It's 2,500 to buy 100 shares right now, but only 800 to buy the $50 2023 call contract so you could literally control 3x the shares with the same capital at a price we all expect $PLTR to reach.

I'd advise doing this to maximize your gains/minimize your risks unless you were planning on swing trading or selling calls/puts with those shares.

I think I just talked myself into buying the 2023 $50 calls, so thanks!!
Can you teach me how to read this please? It has too many colors and not enough rockets.

The only reason I sold my oil tanker shares was to buy GME. I've already gained back what I lost on tankers, that's the beauty of shares over options.
if you had a seven figure account would you just switch to selling options?
seems accurate, I wouldn't touch that stock with a 10 foot pole. It's just not investing , the stock may go up but any bubble can only get so big before it pops 🤷🏻‍♂️
Whats the move this week?
I accept some of that but it's still just a symptom of an environment with so much optimism, i guess it's just another symptom of low rates.. appetite for risk. Normally speaking, even if these companies were big innovators you still wouldn't see these kind of inflows and certainly not increased valuations. Stocks that sold shares last year ie offerings, outperformed rest of the NASDAQ by 40%.. that is definitely not normal.

Whats the play this week?
They did, but they also warned the sub that a majority of their position was that the Warrants for PRPL were undervalued. From there, the position transformed into a theory that their sales were hugely underestimated based on deliveries being delayed despite factories being still at full production.

When PRPL quarterly earnings came out and the CFO said that the undelivered orders wouldn’t be counted in the quarterly revenue and the EPS was low, the stock evaporated because the hype wasn’t there anymore.

I so badly wished that I was on the Put side coming up to earnings.
What we lost on that trade We'll make it back 42069% fold on gme.

Position is 3 1/29 $103c, wish I had bought more sooner for less
Yes makes perfect sense. I think it’s the incentive to call near date at all that’s tripping me up I think I’m missing something. See 2/26 call for $BB gonna cost me $177 so it needs to rise by $1.77 to break even. With that premium why not just call 11.5 for the same date? You’re expecting it to meet that in the first place to break even at all if you were calling 10.5. So you call 11.5, risk less money, and you’re expecting it to go there anyway. Or is making near date calls ALSO a way to mitigate risk while leaving the door open for gains cuz it seems like I could just buy shares for that. If you don’t have the funds to buy many shares surely you don’t want to risk the losses that can happen calling near date? Even IF it meets the target price.
God speed
My question is does that make sense to do? If i’m bullish on GME

100k is pretty hard, once you past 100k it’s mentally a lot easier, 1-2% gains are easier to chase and less work to find
To stop lending you generally need to not sign up for it or not turn it off. Sell orders doesn’t necessarily stop it.

You are correct that from an ‘all longs’ perspective, making short inventory available hurts the long cause. But the incentive to cheat is very high (borrow fees can get large) and the damage to yourself is very low (no one knows, and your contribution reduces price very slightly, while providing tremendously larger payments). 

From a rational self interest perspective, you should lend shares. From other perspectives, like ‘solidarity with other kings’ you shouldn’t.

I have it always turned on. Helps me in reverse when I’m short (others like me) helps me when I’m long (yield enhancement).
Sorry, it's Saturday night. It's been a long pandemic with no friends, sorry guy
Exactly the last time I bought a car this shit head who tried to sell it to me pretended like they didn't have black seat interior and the only one available was Gray which conveniently came with the sport package
Man that's a high target. If it was at least past earnings you'd have a better shot i think. I think it's a realistic price but that's a short time frame and theta will eat you alive if it stays sideways next week. If you're even on it I'd get out. If you don't care about the money fuck it see what happens. Sell your patents shit at the pawn shop to buy gme.

You know I was thinking about that yesterday while driving. My state is one that banned Tesla from selling the ithout using a dealership. I mean what good is a dealer anyways? They’re a scummy middleman trying to squeeze a buck
He was constantly trying to get people to sell GME before this week. Even this week he kept saying “this was a big short squeeze” even tho at this point it is clear that it wasn’t. In the meantime he tried to pump his other stocks “just because” they had a high short interest.

I really don’t understand how people don’t see that this guy is a rat and just want to fuck people on WSB over in favor of his friends at Wall Street!

Bring em
Hoping to get a big bounce Monday afternoon and Tuesday so I can snag a few 365p’s for feb.
Retail shorts, probably. Good thing for us that retail shorts are easier to squeeze than Melvin. Paper hands go both ways. They’ll cover earlier, driving the price higher.
Strikes don’t matter. Shorter term is higher risk/reward. Longer term is lower risk/reward

How is your current position holding out? Considering the recent agreeable price action to your thesis would you consider buying more puts further out, like April?
I went full fuck it mode and bought 2023 $10 leaps. I figure by then the stock price will be somewhere  around 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Thinking GME profits into pltr and bb for the autist trifecta
Get used to it
Exactly. We front-ran this because we believed in a thesis and stuck around until it started (not done yet 🚀 🚀) and now they're acting like we played a role in triggering it.  We're just making mad tendies while the shorts burn.
We shall rise even harder with this dip
That's a great way of putting it lol.
they need to sell some computer parts instead of anime posters
I wonder how many regularly comment but aren't subscribers.

I've commented frequently for months but only joined last month because I thought the sub might go private.
This sounds wise. Can you by chance provide a YT link or an ELIA?
It was less but the 🌈🐻 have increased that amount because they’re covering a large qty from that run of 65M & 153M.

Why can’t you tell anyone? It’s not like you can retire off that now a days
Banks would only do this due to a substantial increase in retail shorts this week. Substantial squeeze actually attracted more shorts to the stock for the ride down. What they don't know is gme insiders already predicted this.. expect some news within two weeks
Harambe held too long.

Sure. Except for how about you choose one where we win in both the short and long term:

He was appointed Guardian of Scotland and served until his defeat at the Battle of Falkirk in July 1298. In August 1305, Wallace was captured in Robroyston, near Glasgow, and handed over to King Edward I of England, who had him hanged, drawn and quartered for high treason and crimes against English civilians.

1 - $10c 2/12
7 - $9c 2/12
I've only recently been made aware of this whole thing. Let me see if I got this right.

\- Sharpie man is shorting GME in hopes that they would go bankrupt. 

\- wsb collectively started buying heaps of GME stocks to try and force a short  squeeze, this pumped GME's stocks from 4 to about 39. 

\- Sharpie is sticking to his guns that on the 20th the stocks will fall to nothing. 

Did I get this right? Not even sure if I understand what's going on.
I too went to the local gamestop today, bought a switch and some games. Hung around for a bit and people kept coming, two employees couldn't keep up checking people out. They were  in the midst of a redesign and from talking to them seems business has been booming.


My favourite type of posters are the  "*I've followed this sub for a while and now I want to talk about Investments*" people.  

Just stick a fork in the toaster already.
Here's a question –

If we enable our shares to be loaned out, it increases the share availability – so when investors who need to cover their position and buy shares go to do so, it's not a problem.

&#x200B;

If we place limit sell orders / prevent our shares from being loaned, it constrains availability and increases the probability of a share shortage and resulting price squeeze.

&#x200B;

Do I have that right or wrong?  


If i'm right, then why would we enable that kind of loan program? It does not seem to behoove us in our mission to milk every penny out of the shorts.
"Buy the Dip!" would have been better instead of the hold for target price.

I've been holding it since January 2020. I have spent countless hours reading up on them and it's led me to believe they have thus contract in the bag, just waiting on Biden to lock himself in and for the USPS to announce it. Sold off 500 of my shares to secure profit and to hop on the GME tends train but im not selling a single share of the 1000 I have left until they win it.

There's no way roblox isn't profitable at this point. I know in terms of EPS they are making losses bit my understanding is that it's because they can't book robucks as profit until the kids spend it. Otherwise it's booked as deferred revenue.

A million dollars is enough to live a very comfortable life and never have to work again.
You're right serious people aren't going to GME for parts... right now. That could change if they position themselves correctly, like a more accessible microcenter or something. There's a ton of opportunity to do something different for them, especially in the ecommerce space, and they are obviously now interested in making some big moves so I have a lot of hope personally.

It's very important to understand that when Melvin does a short sale on the equity they are essentially selling non existant shares to then open market trying to drive the price down...its an expensive manipulation strategy. Also, when they sell puts, MMs need to hedge which also drives the price down.

TLDR, there is no price target. If we all put sell limit orders at 420, then that's the price target. That's the price Melvin has to pay to close their shorts.

to all of you who are thinking about selling GME, trust the process. A couple weeks ago, people bought at $22 and sold for a massive loss. Several people bought at $38 and probably sold at $32 for a massive loss. Those paper handed pussies could have been in the deep green right now, but they have no faith. Even if you bought at $42, you will be in the green soon. DIAMOND HANDS 💎

Most people are dumber nowadays compared to 30-40 years ago
So, you’re not gonna find them, OK.

The guy that turned a $1500 TSLA LEAPS into $3M made it because TSLA was trading sideways for like 3 years, before this year long run. IV was probably stupid low.

Now that shit just explodes everywhere, good luck finding a ticker that:
* Is a well-known, well-understood company
* Has a lot of upside potential
* Is not a meme stock
* People are not buying options left and right
* Is not a penny/cheap stock
* Has options
* Did not jump 100% in a month
* Traded sideways for months, at least

Tesla was all this in 2019. Find another company like this, and you’ll find your cheap and yet somehow amazingly profitable LEAPS.

Therein lies the problem - such a company pretty much doesn’t exist today, because we’re in a bubble and everything’s hot. I’m not saying bubble’s popping any time soon, but it’s making options expensive on average.

Nice!
Anyone have any thoughts on WKHS?
Bro this guy made ppl rich of chwy and now he got the whole gang
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌖🔭🔭
Hmm I can't see the DoJ letting that happen but we've seen crazier things happen
Sell a higher strike shorter dated against it for extra profit?
Anyone else feel like dumping buckets of cash into SOFI  lending and IPOE?
Bullish news for EV: Xcel Energy plan for Colorado includes $5,500 credits for EV purchase, electrification of school buses (maybe Lightning eMotors?????) and installation of 20,000 charging stations:

Not here ...... and i absolutely cherish it
Been there. Eventually one of them will be clingy and start to come around more often. You’ll start to like her too. Then you’ll get married, divorce sometime later and she’ll take half your shit. You’re in a good position
Depends. Between now and 2023 there will be a time when you can sell those options for a profit. Will you panic sell when the option goes down 20–60% or will you diamond hands that bitch until you’re at a profit again?

They had a few periods of being completely down during trading hours. People lost a lot of money when they couldn't execute at the moment they wanted to. I also had a scare with a big day trade that wouldn't sell and I lost $900
Err enjoy your free 1200$ for a short kids video and be happy?
I just bought robux for my kid. 🤷‍♂️
You’ve got to risk it for the biscuit my man. 

But if GME went to $41 it would turn that 47k into 250k

We’ve al been told the price is about to shoot up during the squeeze?
Yes
Probably not the best idea to post your drugs on snapchat idk why people do that

Shit... that's roughly a third of what I paid the last year
One of my favorite scenes. Another is "Moze, operation Phoenix is a go!"
haha rockets haha gay bear haha tendies look at me im retarded and an autist haha brrr
Give it to a homeless person. They don't eat real food so they'll be used to it
That strike price is confident af
I’m not using margin
Why? Way less leverage
Damn I’ve been using 🚀not $ this whole time... fuck
Best Buy has a market cap of $27 billion and $49 billion annual revenue. GameStop currently has a market cap of 2 billion with 6-8 billion revenues yearly (but their online sales since Cohen hopped on board are up 309%) on fundamentals alone, cutting fat by closing stores, their excellent balance sheet this stock should double from here. Ryan Cohen to me is like Lebron James going to the LA Lakers. The lakers had zero hope, it was a questionable decision but after a year it paid off and the lakers came back during his sophomore season and won the title. Proving every single doubter and 🌈🐻 wrong. Any company worth its salt is only as good as the CEO. Ryan Cohens don’t grow on trees. If Elon Musk left Tesla evaluation would immediately drop. It’s like when Jobs passed away & then Tim Cook took over. We saw a dip. (And you can bet your ass Jobs would be doing a way better job than Tim Apple) Either way. GameStop just picked up a hot fresh talented brilliant CEO who went up against Amazon in direct competition & Succeeded. I’m fully sold and I wish I had been on board sooner. It’s seriously so clear to me now.
Because of this I’ll buy 1 call and 1000 shares.  Fuck you Melvino.
yeah, that was the worst. Other companies would moon for a lot less, but bb was like "ho hum good news maybe i'll -0.1% today"
I'm in 100 something shares at 10.97 and a handful of 2/26 $15 calls.

Correct. Asian males are going to get rekted.
IBM
GME
At 75% margin requirement, a person who went margin long at $43 won't get liquidated until $10.75.
I do 3 plays at a time: my short terms, my mid terms and my long terms. Most of my long term investment capital is in PLTR shares, so the rest is in cheap long shots like BB and NOK leaps.
I'd like to point out I made this joke before I saw the Hamilton rap but I've repurposed it
I'm retarded can someone explain this differently to me
On top of that I walk in there on the morning of Black Friday and I get yelled at to leave and wait outside by the token ‘gamer girl’ that works there.

Turns out there’s a 5 person limit so including the 3 employees and the father and son customers I would have had to wait outside for God knows how long on what’s supposed to be their busiest day of the year.
If you're in the US I recommend waiting untill market opens Tuesday.
A lot of times shorts push a stock down so they can buy it cheaper then fuck the retail investors as it goes up
70 here as well, according to the survey us under 100 stock holder have a combined total of over 32k held. You are as vital as I am, as vital as our prophet DFV.

Maybe because nobody is selling LEAPS that high on PLTR 🧐
Yes that quite literally is what we are playing, this is also why our best play is bold yolos to make big money because we don’t have the inside information and ability to manipulate stock prices like these firms do which allows them to make consistently solid profits
Oh I see. Pretty sure margin allowances are calculated based on current market price of securities, not what you paid for them.
realistically how high do you retards expect GME to actually go?
Midnight 🅿️eekend 🅿️ow check. Blood 🔴
Not op, but, For me it's the fact it's going IPO.  Which makes me worry someone going to do something dastardly and then go bankrupt
If you watch on Crunchy Roll, the top comment on every one piece episode is a timestamp to skip the recaps. So convenient
One day a lucky soul on wsb will represent us on CNBC and that will be the day I die happy 🙂
What’s the ticker
Probably one of those Indian call scammers.
Buy AT&T shares for the dividends, chances are they will go up as well long term.

Tanker gang. May it rest in peace
The float and short interest grew? That's unexpected isn't it?
Imagine if the 21st Century is just a repeat of the 20th
It's only gonna get harder in liberal america too.

My autistism and retardness are spiking simultaneously..is this normal for a statement like that
Here here
How do you buy stock in the uk? I've never invested before
If you check their tos I'm sure they have an odds table
1500 shares of BB and sell premiums
spend $4,995 on way OTM calls on anything and the other 5 on lube
1 things forsure 2 things for certain GME gonna MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Look st the sub then dont do any of it
A while back I bought 4-month out calls. They’ve been launching (still 3-months out) but I have no idea when to sell. It’s an etf so imagine it will continue its boring ass steady rise...

Risk tolerance = tiny non-negotiable paycheck, sub-10K portfolio, massive debt.  Any advice, wsb? Must I decode the mystical Greek alphabet?

Yall enjoy your options when I can’t even buy options because my country doesn’t allow it :/
