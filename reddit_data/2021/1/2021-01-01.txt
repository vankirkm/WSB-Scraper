Bulls: GameStop is literally the first company to think of e-commerce gaming! They’ll kill it! Let’s ignore the 6 year head start Steam, EGS, Sony and Microsoft direct to consumer stores, Amazon, target, bestbuy, Walmart all have!
This is not a safe place. No one cares.
Flair me mods. I’m the only one here who thinks you’re straight
Get in loser, we’re going to space ...
> So I agree with you that I would love to see full self driving rolled out by now, but knowing the scale of what they're doing makes me just a little bit more patient.

I had to google Starcraft. I know that was a type of pop-up camper.

Doesn't it bother you, though, when Elon looks right at the camera and lies that he will have robotaxis working in 2020 and then does literally nothing to prove that they are even working on the problem of robotaxis? Not even a demonstration or beta project or run some empty cars on public roads to prove they can do it?

Well, if people read their broker messages, they would be wise to sell off on Monday so they don't have to open an overseas brokerage account.  The sell off is going to cause the Chinese ETF's to drop and the American ETF's like FXI are definitely going to lose a few points.  Unless the big funds already dumped - I didn't see much action last Friday, and some of the listed stocks actually went up ($CHL, $CEO)!

But yeah, not being able to get out is a question above my pay grade.  I'll let the Pelosi's and McConnell's of the world answer that.

“for every Microsoft Xbox console that GameStop sells going forward, GameStop will get some percentage of the revenue from every digital full game download, DLC, microtransaction, and any subscriptions as well”.  Hopefully, GME is in talks with Sony on something similar but this deal could be exclusive. Regardless, it’s pretty bullish and I can’t believe I missed that part of the deal. Thanks Rod

Okay so say you are a business in Portland OR. You have some freight that needs to be sent down to Brentwood California for the customer right? Let’s say it’s Monday and the customer wants it no later then Thursday.

So you call up a logistics broker right? Pick your poison because they are all trash. 

Broker goes okay yeah we can have it picked up for you no problem...

They get weights and dimensions of your shit and let’s say.... they charge you like $2.00 a pound. It’s 800# so you agree $1600 to ship it and they will come get it. Great, they email the label and a Bill of Lading. This magical piece of paper that matches up with your label. Says 3 day Air freight is the service level. Even though it’s Monday you would think well why can’t ground work? They will tell you oh “Monday is over for shipping you missed the window of close.” Best we can do is 3 day air. Whatever you agree.


In the background logistics company is calling up idk United Airlines or whoever.. southwest....? Pick one their all shit.

They go, oh hey we have some 3day air freight going to California can you get it in a airplane for $800?


Airlines agree, they send logistics company a airfreight label with a bill of lading. 

Great logistics company has $800 profit, so they go get a driver to do a pick local pickup in Portland for $125. They pick it up from you and take it to the airport.... great logistics company has pocketed $675. Done deal. All they did was answer the phone and call a driver from joe blow trucking. 

Now while joe blow is picking up your freight and taking it to the airlines, the airlines will call up a line haul company and go oh hey, what’s line haul cost from PDX to SFO terminal? They make some barter deal with two fucks shipping for 0.$25 cents per pound and $0.50 per mile as fuel surcharge.

Let’s say it cost... idk $450 for them to truck it’s down to SFO. The agreement is made and they create a label and bill of lading. Great.

Now two fucks shipping will tender the last haul, either they deliver it or, they find **ANOTHER** company to deliver the freight to Brentwood California.

They’ve got $450 to play with so they offer the bud up to some local company to pick up from SFO dock and send it to Brentwood for $175. Someone takes it. They create a shipping label and Bill of lading, exchange paper work and the deal is sealed....

So here’s what happens. You just paid for 3 day air shipping because you were told nothing could move until Tuesday.

Guy comes and pick up your freight on Monday which you labeled with the logistics companies tracking number. You sign the bill and the trucker signs the bill.

Truck takes freight to airlines, they reweigh and dim it to confirm the pricing modal works. Great, everyone signs papers and exchanges new tracking information.

Now instead of just putting the freight on the plane that you were paying for, they just slap their own label on it and tell the next trucking company to pick up the line haul freight.

Company shoes up tenders the freight to their terminal, reweighs and dims their freight... slaps their label on it and they get 2 people to team drive to SFO terminal..... it’s still Monday.

Tuesday at around 4pm your freight arrives at the SFO dock. They notice oh we’ve got two day to shuffle this shit around and break it before it gets picked up Thursday morning and delivered by EOD.

Multiple people have tendered your freight and it gets there at the last possible moment.


Really you could have just called PDX line haul company yourself and paid 1/3rd of the price to have it shipped in the exact amount of time without paying 3 middle men.
Dojo can train a set of data I think in a day or two if I'm not mistaken.  But this would be one example of an edge scenario, so there's many many edge scenarios in the world of course.  So while it definitely is taking some sweet time, but now knowing what they're trying to do we can see this only getting better as they continue training the AI.  Just like the first version of the AI starcraft player (alpha star) probably sucked shit at the beginning, but by the end it was better than the best in the world.  

At least their AI is constantly learning and training and getting better.  This bodes well for the future rather than just doing it like a blind man poking around with a stick while on a mapped track (lidar).  It'll be a glorious day when the FSD AI recognizes and knows to avoid the crazy car with the man waving the gun at you on the freeway so you don't get shot by the road rage driver. 

So I agree with you that I would love to see full self driving rolled out by now, but knowing the scale of what they're doing makes me just a little bit more patient.  Since they're not just trying to make a car that doesn't bump into stuff.
🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷 🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷 🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷 🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷 🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷 🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷🐷

I want my flair to be: 👑🐌👑
Gonna throw my stimulus money at a 3-month call and I'm debating between XPEV and LI 

LI has options closer to the earnings date and I can see another nice run-up in the future

XPEV feels undervalued, despite it operating at a loss, and I think it has serious catching up to do. The April calls, assuming no dumb shit happens between now and earnings in March, could be fuckin juicy. 

I would go with NIO, but waiting for Nio Day IV to chill out a bit. Nio would likely be the first out of the three to post a profit for earnings too. 

Thoughts?
I'd like one please. Happy new year!

Compleeeeetly different. GameStop is fighting against two mega trends- retail death and downloadable games. Snap has its place in social media that vertical isn’t dying. Also- let’s not pretend SNAP is some great stock, if you bought around the IPO you’re basically even money with a NASDAQ index fund, but with 4x the volatility.
nobody said europe is a country bruh, also teslas prices will keep going down. how many factories does NIO have around the world? Sorry but Tesla is gonna completely crush NIO

Ok maybe sjw isn’t the right term. 

My point still stands I just feel like lately the majority of his jokes revolve around racism, equality, etc. All crucially important things but just not what I listen to comedy for mostly. 

Yes, his humor has always made a point to make racists the butt of the jokes which is good but now there’s preachy sessions for half the show- you can’t deny that. Just watch literally anything he has made this past year. Now go watch shit from 2018 and prior and you’ll understand what I’m saying.

My best guess is that he’s just getting older and wants to leave more of a lasting impact to problems he sees in the world. Noble- but not as entertaining. Same thing with late George Carlin.

So do some random ass guesses.

For example, I've taken the temperature with a thermometer up my ass every trading day. When it's an even numbered temp, I buy a call on TSLA. When it's an odd numbered temp, I buy a put.

Some ass temp anal allasys actually works.
Why? This is not like Skysports or bet365 in England nor ESPN n Fox sports here. These companies will  not let Fubo grow. Not to mention Draftking, FanDuel, Penn or churchill even with minor player like Golden Nugget all trying to carve up this niche market. It's not a cake walk.

You're correct in that your size draws attention. Further, the open interest or volume at a price level probably won't accommodate your size, thus forcing you to take less advantageous positions or leg-in over time.

No issues there. There’s a reason you’re up 175K for the year. No reason to change up the formula. You could sell deep OTM calls at .40 delta that opens a very small risk inclination with a nice 10%+ boost to your yearly return.

This animal wheel is broken.
Just understand that you're leaving the realm of investing and entering the realm of speculation. 

You're no longer putting money in companies that generate money and (somehow) return it to you and instead, are placing a bet that something will happen in the future, with very little margin of safety. 

Right now, everyone's a winner so everyone thinks they're smart. When the tide goes out (for whatever reason), the story is different. A huge part of winning over the long term is not losing it all during some short-term bloodbath, which is a thing a lot of these retards don't understand, largely because Autism is a cognitive processing disorder which often times stunts time-orientation.

PS definitely not me, when I pee outside like a manly man, I can't even cast a shadow, and I usually get my belt wet.
If I sell a call, I’m short delta. If I have to sell it covered by stock, my buying power reduction is whatever it would be for me to hold the stock. I can usually get more leverage by just selling a naked put (depends on the underlying) than with a covered call, and always by just buying a call. 

Covered calls feel like I’m giving up a lot of upside for not much return most of the time. I like them as part of a hedge, but they’re not my fav in a market like this
Just wanted to say that SPY is completing the cup&handle formation. Guaranteed to reach at least 378 this week. Play accordingly
Don’t get me wrong I own nio stock myself and I can see it doing well in China but I am doubtful it will do well amongst the Europeans. UK is flooded with Tesla’s, Norway, Sweden, Austria, Finland even the lower GDP countries such as Latvia, Lithuania. Everybody at the moment wants a Tesla here if you ask any European what EV would you buy a nio or a Tesla. You will get your answer it is not about what you want. It is about what the consumer wants and that is not nio

They are not competing with Teslas here. A Tesla would cost around 90,000 here. A Nio is around 40,000. That's what all the article point out. They compare Nio with an Audi for 60,000 and say that it has a comparable performance and costs 20,000 less

Around 1000% on GME calls but that doesn’t mean shit, the amount of money Burry put into that play was insane, 500% on that much money is incredible
I don't overthink it too much. Just know your break-even and if you think that price can be easily reached by expiry. For example, I bought these leaps for a strike of $450, expiring 2022, and premium was about $100. That means my break-even is $550... I had no doubts Tesla would surpass $550/share by 2022. It also helps to buy during a time of low volatility. I bought after Q3 earnings when the stock was trading flat. There's usually an IV crush after tesla earnings. Best time to buy LEAPS (assuming stock isn't skyrocketing after earnings).

For real, someone tried to tell me Gamestop going to an online platform was going to make them a fortune.  They didn't appreciate it when I compared it to the 1999 dot-com bubble and suggested Gamestop might be 20 years late...

Just depends on your market.  Real estate is only local.  I live in midwest and would not be selling now.  They can't build houses fast enough.  Barring some insane catastrophe, prices are only going up out here.

In general this is a good message...but remember, this is r/wallstreetbets, lots of retards here. Could very well go off the rails. You don't want to be like, "You know what, I think I wanna try some crystal meth today" and then have friends or a significant others be like, "Ya, you know what, you do you, I support that, let's do it!" and then end up a run down crack addict living in one of those homeless camps under some city bridge, sucking for a buck to save up enough to buy your next fix instead of more calls on PLTR so you can get more WSB followers from all the loss porn and memes you'll be making XD.

You definitely need people to tell you when to stop as well, but it's a balancing act, like everything else in life.

Crazy to think that Michael Burry made an insanely risky play that resulted in death threats and lawsuits even afterwards to earn a little less than 500% profit, when someone could’ve just held TSLA shares over the last year to make over 700%. And that’s not even with options.


Just curious, have any of you had a ten bagger? What’s the most % profit you’ve had on a single play?
> Driverless systems that use lidar and HD maps primarily will never work as a generalized autonomy solution.

Then it should be child's play for TSLA to do the same thing in Chandler! They should run a competing driverless robotaxi service there for cheaper than Waymo. I think Elon Musk said they would be able to run robotaxis for like $.18 per mile or something, right?

Physical copies will come to an end soon. It’s just not financially logical to keep producing physical copies
Questioner: Can you tell me of the earliest, first known thing in the creation?

Ra: I am Ra. The first known thing in the creation is infinity. The infinity is creation.

Questioner: From this infinity then must have come what we experience as creation. What was the next step or the next evolvement?

Ra: I am Ra. Infinity became aware. This was the next step.

Questioner: After this, what happened?

Ra: Awareness led to the focus of infinity into infinite energy. You have called this by various vibrational sound complexes, the most common to your ears being “Logos” or “Love.” The Creator is the focusing of infinity as an aware or conscious principle called by us, as closely as we can create understanding/learning in your language, intelligent infinity.

13.8 Questioner: Can you state the next step?

Ra: The next step is still, at this space/time nexus in your illusion, achieving its progression as you may see it in your illusion. The next step is an infinite reaction to the Creative Principle following the Law of One in one of its primal distortions, freedom of will. Thus many, many dimensions, infinite in number, are possible.

The energy moves from the intelligent infinity due, first, to the outpouring of randomized creative force, this then creating patterns which, in holographic style, appear as the entire creation no matter which direction or energy is explored. These patterns of energy begin then to regularize their own local, shall we say, rhythms and fields of energy, thus creating dimensions and universes.

These are the same people that diamond hand their calls to 0 and, on the way down, continue to throw more money into the crap position instead of closing it out.  Got to know when to hold them, know when to fold them.

In Gamestop's case, if you have a store that has continually lost money for many quarters, it probably isn't going to turn around even if you throw money at it.  As sucky as it is for the employees, it's common for companies to restructure like this and spend the money on the locs (now and future) that make money.

First of all, Europe is not a country. Maybe only top earners in Germany and in comparable top economies can afford a Tesla. You can look at the income in Spain, Portugal, Eastern European countries. People won't be buying Teslas there. Second, governments make driving gas cars very expensive and give big discounts for buying EVs. People will be searching for affordable EV alternatives. So far, there is only VW e up that looks awful and has an awful range. Nio provides quality and a Luxus feeling for a good price. They don't know about Nio because it's not offered here yet but the word spreads fast.

We’re probably both fucked. If you can break even cash out as that is my plan. 

Make some cash by buying stocks not options. 5-10-20 stocks at a time. You can even dollar cost average buying stocks. 

Add some cash to a stock you think will have a great long term value. 

Only option on stocks with extra cash from either gains from your long term or if an option is cheap enough and your comfortable with the possibility of losing it.

Yeah that’s really what I was thinking about. This new one is not as bad but still makes it easy to sit on your ass. You want to support people that need it but you can’t even come close to compensating them entirely or you remove the motivation to work at all in the first place.

Word is Cohen was offered a board seat and turned it down. There are two board seats scheduled to become vacant by June. He doesn’t want to be the dissenting vote that gets overruled by the board majority. See his letter to the board a couple months ago. He wants more influence than a mere seat at the table.

Pick a day a few weeks out. On that day you go clean until you break. Till then let the idea stick with you. Start winding down dosage/usage. Get your mind right.
Also would agree with this case. Look at the UBI claims in the largest shipping ports on the coasts. Compound that with paying people dogshit wages and people being constant assholes.

Up 307% in my main brokerage, and up 148% in my Roth. All thanks to Papa Elon and The CRISPR goddess Jennifer Doudna.
It’s really a fascinating industry to me. I haven’t dug too deep into how operations are handled but I would imagine they try to make the “worker” functions as foolproof as possible. I.e. scan a code and a machine prints the correct label for you directly in front of the relevant package. That way you’re much more reliant on software than worker intelligence. I guess even then they will try to get away with undercutting the lowest denominator there too
Give me money daddy Elon

is it still a wash sale if I sell a call for $100 and then buy one for $110?
I just saw this tiktok girl claiming she slept with half the nfl team-listing each and every one I’m dead
The assumption that a sale would be needed regardless is based off the assumption that if the other stores had space and a market for the increased inventory, they should already be stocking an increased inventory. To suggest otherwise is to suggest that the stores are being ran inefficiently. 

Also, they aren't losing 60% on the entire store, they have probably gone through stages 20% off, 30%, 50%, suggesting that the stuff that is left is the stuff that is less desirable to consumers. Also, when I worked retail, some of our stuff had a mark up of 50%, granted that's not counting overhead, but it means they aren't losing as much on a per item basis as you might think. I was able to find a source showing that gamestop has an average 30% profit margin on their products(it's from 2013, but I think it will work for our discussion). So at a 30% profit, for every $100 of retail value, their cost is $70. So even if they discounted everything to 60% off(which they didn't), to them they are only selling it at a a 40% discounts. But back to what happens, they start at 20% off and the popular stuff goes first, then they go to 30% off, where they are breaking even on the price, and the rest of the popular stuff goes. Then they go to 40% off, yes they might be losing money, but not enough to justify spending money to ship out to another store. But the time you get to 60% off, the stuff that is left is not popular and not worth sending to another store anyways. 

I'm not saying that the accounting aspect is about not wanting to make your life hard, but I wonder if they have the current accounting capabilities to perform moving stock to other stores. Moving 20% of your entire retail stock to other stores would be a massive accounting challenge, I doubt the current in house accounting department is capable of taking on this vastly increased work load, Most likely you are hiring additional accountants or outsourcing the work, both of which cost money. The accounting work for normal operations has to be far less complicated than moving stock from one store to another.
Doesn't matter 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

The pattern they all follow. They all follow the same exact pattern and are very predictable up until a certain point. And not only are they predictable, but they have a price floor. You can make very large bets with minimal risk and extreme potential upside, where the upside is much more likely than a downside.

UPDATE: Averaged down and added 400 More contracts for an average cost per share of 1.91 (1400 Contracts total). Total YOLO is now $267K Friday's 4% bump brought me up 50k for the day and about to -48% overall (12% rise) at the worst point it was down -70% so this felt better lmao. If this holds into next week I will be in a much better mood to continue to diamond hand it.

If Dems win GA (early voting has GOP worried), we are gonna see a bump on these EV, Green Energy and MJ holdings. Any additional positive Analyst PT will add to the momentum. Looking for a 10% increase next week, if we don't see that by Wednesday then we will start looking at that parachute to jump into the next play.

As much as people like to spend money on awards here blatantly asking for them is probably not gonna work but then again I’m just another retard
I took a quick browse at poverty finance to feel better about myself, they straight up were making more money on unemployment and don't want to work.
Very bullish
Awarded to oblivion? You must mean downvoted..
Hey retard if you want awards you specifically ask not to get an award.
it's not even a wealth gap thing. my apartment is pretty nice and my rent is probably similar to a decent house's mortgage i just have never wanted a yard. but more and more i want more space between me and my neighbors

I mainly scalp futures for the leverage without the disadvantages of options but still do some options trades here and there. Lately, been looking into trading shares of stocks just to have more tickers to look at.
More like 2035
Anything but sideways !!
I love how those people always film themselves as if they believe so wholeheartedly that they are in the right, being victimized by a corrupt system.
What would make you happier - if you had that 35% back or a life that gives you the freedom to pursue your hobbies?  Sounds like you made the right decision.
Got in before close Friday. 25 shares but I’ll get more

I wasn't even talking politics. I was mentioning that politics do get brought up here in relation to what might rocket depending on who wins races and potential future moves by said party. I've always wanted a stalker ;)

Yeah I agree
Are business charities to you? I doubt these business owners in logistics aren't dying to expand. Very competitive industry, low cost usually wins.
Calls on your depression and STD’s I guess
That’s the tricky bit, isn’t it? With Porche’s case, they can dictate that and sell at the highest. With retailers, all the groups are dispersed, so it makes it harder to define what the top is. But WSB is like its own hedge fund so.. 🤷‍♀️🤷‍♀️

Tbh...battery day was a huge success.  I won't go into the details, but it was.  Between that and 3Q earnings, it makes sense that the stock had gone up triple digits or whatever its gone up.  Just took a few weeks to begin to happen.

Nio day will be killer.  Goes beyond batteries.  Those new sedans are going to knocks ppl off their seats.

Heard that, my bro died similarly. Ended up finding him and taking that fucker to the woods and beating him almost to death and leaving him there. Cut his ear off and broke every bone from his left ear to his right ear. I thought i killed him, and i didn’t feel any better after doing it. 

Wasnt worth the super felony and the time. Still haven’t forgiven the guy and it eats my lunch every day. From what i hear forgiveness is the only way to move on but I’m still here hurt 9 years later. 

If you ever need to vent feel free to hmu and try not to find him and kill him. Only things I learned was his family doesn’t deserve what he did to my family. And just because everything happens for a reason doesn’t mean it’s a good reason.

If the senate stays red after next weeks runoff elections you’re gonna get a beating on FCEL & TAN (maybe even TSLA).  The dems get both seats they should pump hard.
I think you can 100x your money in a year if you know the universal SPAC blueprint.

Good DD, your temps should be in the same system tho
Maybe it's marketing to blame. A little too much doom and FUD, and not enough ado made the relentless researchers and their American vaccine. I'd suggest doing profiles on some of these heroes. Make them stars. The vaccine needs a name like Salvation-1 or CoviCounter.
It has hit today. Now I need all of you to buy PLTR so my $30calls expiring soon get ITM. Dont let me baghold like $NKLA again. do it for the culture, and me.. help.
I’d wager that the people who are most likely to have severe enough symptoms to show up at the hospital are largely in the same group as people who will get a vaccine shot to be safe. Hospitals don’t need to be completely free of Covid patients, just need to incoming Covid patients to not outnumber the patients leaving (recovered or otherwise). Once that balance is sustained, hospitals will be able to manage and stuff will be like any other illness. As it is, people are already not being admitted to a hospital for Covid unless they have severe enough symptoms to cause concern. I would imagine once a large enough swath of the at risk population gets vaccinated, that will dramatically improve things even if the larger population lags behind in vaccine adoption. 



Of course I’m not a medical professional in any way shape or form so take that what I’m saying with that context.

i would but i cant

GME will pay out dividends in gamestop store credit

God I wish I acted on my impulse around that...was so obviously a sell the news event...there was no way Elon was ever going to live up to the expectations that were built up. But I sat on my hands and watched it happen instead of getting a piece of the action....

Sure i agree. While i see no problem with roping people into a general category you should play your hand close to your chest until more evidence presents itself. There are a lot of dumb people that believe the earth is round, does that mean everyone who thinks the earth is round is dumb? No.
The thing has been taking off, possible 200 million vaccines to EU. I got caught in the hype but I’m not worried since I got shares. Thanks for your help!
If the bankers are smart (which they arent), what they do is theyve got a number. 'We are taking 20% of the entire economy' or somesuch. You can do this that or the other, they'll turn some levers, run a printer, and get their cut

cnbc"predicting" jan correction so much it probably wont happen. 100% agreement among everybody including me there will be correction cant be right.
Wth i can barely see it with all the cars in the way and it being dark
What in the hell? I remember seeing this stock when it was under $10

Anyway, around 109-109.50 then around 103. Once you avg down, set a sell at break even. It should go back to at least $120 eventually so hopefully the new shares will bring your avg down below that.
No ragrets
No it’s an ev play like AAPL
That makes sense, and I’ll check out the video. Appreciate the insight!
At least you didn't refuse to take a phonecall from the Musk himself

That works in a “well you made your choice now deal with it” kind of way, but less in a public health strategy kind of way. When people get sick they’re going to show up at the hospital and we’re going to keep having these waves until a lot of people have been killed off or have long term organ damage.
Anyone who thinks we're getting in cuz we are looking past this year is an idiot.

I sold 3 AAPL $143 1/29 puts for $8 last Tuesday. Timing wasn’t perfect, but I’m good with $8. Will prob roll mid Jan. Easy money. Zero risk, as I don’t mind assignment, and selling .20 delta $160 calls brings in premium and $17per if assigned. $22 plus call premiums is nice for a 60 day hold.

Mark my words. You are going to lose the shirt off your back with puts. Thinking of Salesforce as a pure CRM company is an antiquated way of thinking. They are driving the digital transformation of so many companies. Read up on their Digital 360 offering. Salesforce runs entire e-commerce sites such as Under Armour and runs digital marketing for countless companies. Companies need to go digital or they die. Not only is Salesforce helping power this revolution, they provide a single source of truth for each and every one of a company’s customers. This is not a nice to have but a must have after what covid has done.

Covid has known long term effects in a decent chunk of even young people. Yet people are worried about some unknown hypothetical long term effects from a vaccine even though vaccines don’t have delayed long term effects like that. Doesn’t make sense.
Luckily the march calls are now the vast majority of my position because i’m down so much on the others 😂

Why are we pumping this shit?
Thats why we buy them
For one this is quarterly EPS and second the average PE for S&P companies is well above 30 right now. It’s not as simple as picking a comparable company to judge an appropriate multiple. For GameStop in particular the console release will distort earnings (unfortunately there’s no way an annualized $8 EPS is sustainable in the short-medium term). You have to look at the bigger picture of sustainable revenue streams to price the company more accurately.
Just buy shares and hold or sell weekly CC and use your premium to buy more shares.
Checking again, I can see what you mean. Most people mean Nasdaq composite rather than Nasdaq 100 when referring to the NASDAQ. TIL.

Well either way, the NASDAQ composite was up 42% this year, and the NASDAQ 100 was up ~46%. To your point though, there was no guarantee of the nasdaq outperforming the SP500 this year.

Q1 2021 speculation case for ARKG:

1) Biotech has high memeability and was a big deal back in the Shkreli days

2) The covid vaccine's use of mRNA will get people interested in genomics in the short term as antivaxxers and vaxxers clash, driving organic conversation about it among normies and retail investors

3) https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&q=Genomics

4) More stimmy

5) I don't know shit about biotech and I won't be able to sift through the bullshit to find a winner and cathie is an infallible genius so i might as well bet on the industry instead of individudal picks

Hey bro I know you are pretty good with GME so I just had a question, if Cohen were to nominate board members before the meeting in June, this would cause a squeeze no? Since there would inevitably be lots of share recalls for the vote, which would be a big issue so most longs would recall right? I saw this happened back in April I think and share price doubled in a week.
I cant read
This post makes a lot of sense which is why the share price will moon fucking this guy and his followers.

I was super impressed with the car at the time. Until today I still don’t understand why I did not put all my savings in Tesla. I am a fucking retard. 😭

If you can do it though that’s a huge weapon you should absolutely be maxing out annually. I think you can put something like 19,500 through mega back door in addition to the 6,000 you can put through regular contributions if you’re under 50. Over 50 and you can do 26k + 7k I believe

I welcome bears. The fact that you read this back and forth and concluded that because I didn’t contend his with his silly arguments puts you in the exact same category. I’m the author of 5 DDs on this stock. Each with hundreds of upvotes and thousands of comments. All the content and arguments and material are within the original DD and particularly in the comments. With respect to the thousands of comments, I have on the actual DDs responded to each and every comment. Every last one. The good and bad. Every point. I said the other day that I was done. A heavy hitter wsb mod direct messaged me the other day and said “you should consider stopping so we can advance our positions, there is a risk here of this memeing on the sub and many of us want to close our other things early in Q1 before re-doubling into psth”. At that point I had already realized I was done actually trying to populate the sub with the info. The truth is I don’t care. I posted this one as a joke, lol. All the content is incorrect including the warrant etc. I’m only explaining this because I plan to produce more quality stuff in the future wrt companies I care about. Tbh I didn’t even read his original comment in its full entirety because halfway through it became nonsense. Ultimately, the spac and the structure speaks for itself. This nobody bought it at $20, lol. Proof is in the pudding.

Housing stays up until they announce a bump in rates, period. There are more buyers than sellers, and all of those forbearances the banks are happy to get them out and get more qualified buyers in. The crash of 2008 was in some part due to many buying and selling properties as investments, and looking for 10-15% annual return. Meaning there were more sellers than buyers.

We'll see $27 again for sure. As long as you have shares, you'll be fine. Once you average down, set a sell at your new average unless you want to hold out for $27 in which case, sell your new shares at the new average and hold your original shares to $27.
Actually most stocks paid dividends at one point, now we just compete to pay capital gains taxes against each other...
cover quickly if you show a profit. not the best time to go short
cathie said last week correction was coming.. ark down 10% from ath... she’s fucking correct about everything so hope you bought that dip
Is it a spac? 

Spacs have shares they sell to retail investors like an ipo and then they have the rest of the shares for founders. 

So initial retail shares are loaded first and then the founder shares get added in later. Not always but most of the time.

Lol. At first they blamed the vaccines, but little did they know......
Well they have an activist investor who is being very aggressive and buying a pretty big stake. If he makes nominations for board members in March or Feb, there would be a huge share recall by longs to vote for it at the next shareholders meeting in June. Which would undoubtedly cause a short squeeze, you could look at last years chart. In April there was an announcement of a proxy fight coming in June, stock doubled in a week, and that was when short interest was much lower, and it was a smaller issue, so not all longs would recall. If it was to happen this year, with Ryan Cohen doing it, for a bigger role, I’d say almost all longs would recall. I’m just saying you could get burned hard if you completely hold through like that, but maybe you won’t idk

Any idea what it means when volume on a stock goes from sub 10m to .8B?
Many things lead to Peter Thiel. I know you're right. Those calls will work out. If we stopped buying retarded weeklies, the share price would stabilize. I think some upgrades are coming.

Found another extremely intriguing, but privately held company with 100x IPO potential. If any SPAC touches it, go all in. [Voltserver](https://voltserver.com/) does [digital electricity](https://www.graboyessmartbuildings.com/2020/01/digital-electricity-results-in-lower-first-costs-for-electrical-infrastructure-and-optimized-building-performance-through-poe-and-iot-d/) which is basically power over ethernet. Safe to touch by hand and very flexible installation and remodelling. With the expected beating CRE and retail will take, flexibility is gonna become top priority. Also, constuction can be done by dummies instead of certified$$$ electicians. Copper isn't gettin any cheaper either so costs might not be too crazy over time.

Setting a Google alert for any news on this one. Any IPO or acquisition is gonna do bonkers numbers.

GameStop.Com will revenue >2x their entire market cap in ONE quarter. I'm sorry but this 'irrational exuberance' you're referring to is just a valuation rerating. It was valued at $190M earlier this year. FMV is easily 3bn+ market cap, so expect the upward trend to continue for some time. I've been riding this trend since Cohen entered and will continue to do so.

You ever think reddit itself gives out lots of awards on here to fool you retards into giving them money so you can participate?
What has life come too!!!!!
It does cost money, though losing 60% on stock in 1,000 stores sounds like a lot.

Also, not firing shots here, but a lot of what you’re saying is kind of making a big deal of the process. You’re assuming the other store would have to have a sale, not sure why. Storage space might be a problem but other than that the stock should be the same as in every other GameStop store, so no reason for it to have to go on sale. There are plenty of stores too, so no need for one store to be doubled up with inventory either. There’s also the online business which should have a warehouse that could hold it. Or online orders could be taken from this stock if it’s for a local order. 

And the issues with sending to various stores- id be almost certain that daily deliveries are made with one truck filling up with GameStop cargo and delivering it to various stores anyway, so shouldn’t be that difficult to facilitate. 

Lastly, it pains my heart to say it, but as an accountant, I’m fairly certain almost no business decisions are made because they might make my job more difficult.
Thanks Captain Obvious
RIP man that's rough.
Hold for sure. GME is just hyped up ATM. There a failing business, everyone just jumped on for the meme but all the new people here forget the whole point is to get in and get out of a meme stock after making cash, not holding it and getting attached. What's GME going to do to push there price higher? Even most consels now are diskless and they were not able to stock the ps5 or new Xbox, losing out on sales for them. Not to mention because they are not moving the next Gen counsel in house no one has buying those games in there stores. Most GME stores can't even fully stock inventory

During the 4th qtr earnings call (October) Tim Cook said the iPhone 12 was going to be a "once in a decade super cycle."  He said that there is a convergence between the carriers, the consumer, and AAPL all wanting to migrate the consumer to 5G.  And the carriers are heavily subsidizing iPhone 12 sales.     Remember that everything Tim Cook says on these conference calls is subject to securities law and vetted by the GC.  Agree the ER is going to be big.  Rockets emoji, rockets emoji.

It’s typically in the SaaS terms and conditions that the software provider doesn’t own a customer’s data and can’t do anything with it or share it with external parties. It’s entirely different than Facebook or Google’s terms, which essentially state that if you’re using their service that they can do what they want with it. Large corporations / government entities would NEVER allow palantir to use their data in such a fashion.

See this is the real shit I’m worried about. When visiting their website from Europe I can’t even see the home page, it just full on blocks me to a white access denied page, probably due to gdpr.

None. The price action on Thurs almost always indicates a red day tho.

Hey, awesome work - I’ve been following your model for a while now. One thing I’ve been trying to figure out though is where your numbers diverge from analyst forecasts. I noticed is that your net margin is much healthier than those forecasts imply - specifically your SG&A forecasts seem low to me. Across the 3 cases you’re forecasting 16-17% of revenue for SG&A whereas I can’t find a historical quarter where GameStop has kept that figure below 20%. Is this because you believe the console sales don’t require the same marketing spend (ie you’re not spending much because the demand is enough to draw customers)? Or does this have something to do with a larger e-commerce mix? I’d love to hear your feedback on this!
Yeah i saw some of the latest gpus, but having prebuilts / actual partnerships with pc component companies would be huge. Mainly what i was looking for

It's not about defunding the police, it's about taking some of their responsibilities away and having trained professionals take the job. So yes, less funding, but for specific activities. Police shouldn't be doing traffic stops, responding to domestic abuse issues, responding to the mentally challenged. The former 2 would be much better solved by social workers.

But it's easy to get people all up in arms by saying the other side doesn't want police. I bet police don't even want to do these activities tbh.

Of course I am sure a select few retards do want no police at all, but the majority just feel they are not trained to deal with certain situations which can be backed up by statistics. Why do so many traffic stops result in death? It makes no sense. Other countries don't have this problem.

It might be worthwhile later if the price normalizes a bit after a target is announced, but yeah the amount of PSTH pump posts on WSB is pretty sketch, especially at such a high valuation before we know anything about the actual deal.

The only people using  gamestop online is 85 year olds buying their grandkids a heavily used ps2 because they don't know what decade it is.
In a sub with 1.8 million "special" people - and I do consider myself as being in that category - it would be more surprising if there weren't at least a few people giving out awards, if for no other reason than that they exist, and granting them is possible. 

Even if they had to be purchased via blood sacrifice, rather than a small fraction of one of Powell's significantly devalued US dollars, I'd still expect to see someone giving some out.

My family flips houses and there is nothing to flip because of the eviction thing. Even before in my town it was competitive to flip a house. We are a little worried about how fast the prices are rising.
Steel is a pump and dump...  There is absolutely no reason a steel company should have the market volatility that some of those stocks currently have.  It’s a long-term industry with a history of extremely large companies finding themselves bankrupt.

The rules of the sub say 2500 for an option play is okay, the big thing is people posting none stop about 1 or 2 tickers because they have shares and have now turned into bagholders. That's where 2 things kick in to keep them to a minimum. Calling people out with "positions or ban" use to legit carry weight before the sub ramped up. People would get temp bans just from sub members saying ban on there post. It kept dog shit out and people in line with the core message of this sub. High risk high reward options with gains, losses, and occasionally a good DD with a meme or two.

I will give you that the Nasdaq increased in value more than I expected, but it is also quite tech heavy itself so I'm not sure it would be the safest investment without knowing how 2020 would go in hindsight. 

&#x200B;

The QQQ is even more tech heavy, selecting almost only the high cap tech stocks from the Nasdaq.
Im kinda new here so forgive my stupidity, but isn't a 40c call categorically retarded? I assume premium is lower because its that far OTM, so if you buy these calls are you banking that the price goes much higher than $40 to get a good return?

What happens if the option expires at, e.g, $42. How much profit could be expected from that?

Anyone here selling calendar spreads? I’m thinking about starting it on PLTR. Buy the May 30c and sell the monthly 30c.

Lmao. None of this shit matters. Stonks only go up.
Old management over extended their physical footprint. New management is dialing it back. Some towns have 3 stores in just a few miles of each other. Makes no sense. On the CC they even stated that they have seen \~40% customer retention from their de-densification strategy and massive improvements to their SG&A line which is improving the bottom line.

Ryan Cohen wants to sell off the entirety of European assets and close the 1000 EU stores. If he gains control of the company and sells of Europe, how do you think the market will react to that? That is essentially the same thing as closing stores here. I can guarantee you the market would see that as bullish and the share price would rise as a result. How do I know? Because the share price is rising already because of these decisions. At the end of the day, that is what the market is for. Invest in a company trying to improve and you benefit from a rising share price.
So let me get this straight:

I can buy “options” on a stock, that give me a certain price at a certain time, I just have to guess right on price and timeframe?

>I honestly think we need to start cleaving people who talk about buying shares, Unless it's over the 10k requirement and can be proven with a positions or ban. This is WSB not r/investing. The amount of people talking about share plays is to damn high, and with this 600 stimulus we are going to get another wave of new members who wanna know where to drop there stimulus on stock plays. This is wsBETS, bets on options or high amounts in stock, not your personal advisor group saying to buy PLTR or GME. If someone posts outside the daily and they are hit with a positions or ban, it should be enforced

I honestly think we need to start cleaving people who talk about buying shares, Unless it's over the 10k requirement and can be proven with a positions or ban. This is WSB not r/investing. The amount of people talking about share plays is to damn high, and with this 600 stimulus we are going to get another wave of new members who wanna know where to drop there stimulus on stock plays. This is wsBETS, bets on options or high amounts in stock, not your personal advisor group saying to buy PLTR or GME. If someone posts outside the daily and they are hit with a positions or ban, it should be enforced
The bull flag has already been broken. This is a bunch of bullshit lines that highlight your technical analysis confirmation bias

The simple answer is buy low sell high.  All the examples you gave are solid long term investment options, but the price variance isn't that high. This is a company that is over 100 percent shorted because it was supposed to die this year.  In August it was 5 bucks a share. They were wrong and that is going to cause the stock to swing hard, much harder than any safe stock. Because all those people who felt as you do lost the bet and have been losing money ever since then, trying to cover the losing positions. I don't need them to be around in 100 years. I just need them to swing up hard for a few minutes so I can sell.
Nice, I’ll take your 600 tho

I have a few friends who went to art school and film school and the closest any of them got to the industry is the stagehand union. One of them who was really good at stop motion and made a whole samurai film in school that was a masterpiece, he is now manager at an Outback. Film school won't make you any more talented at your craft, and if you gotta deal with COVID you can't even network like you could. 

The premium your paying for the school, in terms of both time and money, is not being well spent. Jordan Peele is the last big filmmaker to break out and he didn't go to film school, he worked second city until madTV and networked. I know it sucks to hear but the reality is nobody is going to pick up your film and say wow what a great big brain this guy has, lets throw money at him to make his next film. It's a huge grind and school is just taking away time from you that you could be grinding on something that breaks through.

Well, most 401ks are Roth or traditional. 

I think you are asking 401k or ira. Max your 401k first. Especially if you make a descent wage. It’ll cut your tax bracket if you go traditional. It’s like free money. Then after that go into your ira.

Leverage,

Basically, for the same money that you bought shares,  you could buy 7-10x more 'share equivalent' with options.

For example, 2500$ can only buy u 100 shares of a 25$ stock.   But the same 2500$ may buy you 10 leap contracts, which is a 1000 shares equivalent.

I'm coming to believe these mass awardings within GME posts and comments are not arbitrary, and there are actually people out there who are simply trying to do the right thing and desensitize us to being awarded/rewarded so when the day comes and we wake up to 420.69/a share,  we don't die of shock
I know you’re hugging your pillow. Slobbering all over it.
How do I trade my arrow for GME stock now
Most of that paragraph says nothing except claiming I'm wrong without actually refuting anything I said. Then you throw in an Appeal to Authority where you cite big investors putting money in, again, irrelevant to what I said and just an attempt to pump your position to novice investors.

If you have a complaint about something I said that's wrong, then specify exactly what I said that's wrong.

>The point of tontine is to ensure that there is capital in the tank for the target company.

Uh that's what I said, Ackman specifically rigged it so that there would be no redemptions.

Here's the definition of tontine:
>an annuity shared by subscribers to a loan or common fund, the shares increasing as subscribers die until the last survivor enjoys the whole income.

No redeemed (dead) shares = tontine is a fiction. All he did was attach warrants to common shares to inflate the price, there's nothing "tontine" about it.

> You likely haven’t opened the S1 and if you have, you likely only read the summary.

Dead wrong.

Are you being serious right now? 😂
There’s literally no way this will happen.
It depends on the rest of your savings and lifestyle. I normally recommend at least 7-8% of your own money into your 401(k) as that will help you grow your retirement account at about 10% your income levels (with the match). You'll see this grow bigly as you hit your second and third decade of work.

Also call your HR team/401(k) management. You might already have a Roth 401(k) option
Yea that's about how I feel right now,  also. 

But I've learned that my instincts are so bad, that I should buy when I think a good company is a lost cause.

Absolutely. I am OK with the government covering the cost of community college style university degree. The following conditions would be required: entrance exam, only the top are selected. Must maintain a gpa. A select number degrees are offered. No fluff. 
That should increase the value of a degree and people not meant for college can try something else.

Your bear thesis is priced into the share price. None of your 'points' are new information and have not stopped the valuation from rising. Also expecting a \~$2 EPS for Q4. Company has been trending towards profitability for a few quarters now. The 'circling the drain' argument has been debunked.

Palantir is having a tech demo showing off their products on the 26th. Most of the market doesn't understand what the fuck palantir is actually offering, other than that their clients seem to save money. Publicly showing off their products and how they work will assist boomer investors in understanding the company, and presumably this will result in a higher valuation.

You aren't going to trade shit with just Bayes' theorem, it's literally just a formula for conditional probability, it's so simple that it wont help model anything.

This entire post is bullshit, I was expecting things like higher order derivative trades and arbitrage trades not random bullshit conspiracy 'theories', can't believe this sub upvotes shit like this now.

Keep an eye on the run-up to the ticker change whenever that happens. On ticker day, there's a lot of downward pressure from scalpers so either 1) take your profit and walk or 2) sell your basis and stay invested with your profit.

If you stay in it, don't be surprised if you are a bag holder a day after the changeover.

King came through with the clutch. Bet you feel like an idiot now.
Warrant exercise would dilute a little bit, but usually the PIPE hit is the big one and Ackman is basically filling that role in return for "Forward Purchase Units" - which are shares with special 10 year warrants attached, so there ***might*** not be a short-term PIPE dump after the merger.

I would expect warrant prices to normalize a bit because the quantity will triple helping liquidity, but it really isn't possible to predict whether they'll be higher or lower than the current $9 value since that's highly dependent on where the stock moves.

Usually warrants follow the stock (with a small speculative buying bump at times), but in this case they're being squeezed pre-merger. It's very abnormal to see $4.50 warrants pre-target on a $10 spac, that's normally the price you see very near merger with a good target when the stock is $18ish *($36 PSTH equivalent - PSTH currently $25ish if you subtract fractional warrants)*

That's not to say there won't be a "dilution" style price drop at some point though - there are a couple places it could happen.  One would be the target announcement which Ackman predicted he'd have by Q1 2021 - at that point the company value comes into play. People will actually be able to run the numbers on Ackman's merger proposal rather than just investing on hopes and dreams. That may bring things back to earth.

The second possible event is after the merger when Ackman's units arrive/split - I think he'd keep the warrants long term but it's possible he'd sell off some of the stock - and his stock is basically 50% of the float, so that could have an impact.

&nbsp;

I bought into the units at IPO but at this point I've sold of my shares and warrants because I think the premium is unreasonably high for a mystery box that could be disappointing.  Once I see what the target company is I'll reevaluate if I want to get back in pre-merger and if so at what price.

I have doubts that with a spac this large there will be much money left on the table by the target company after negotiations, which would put a reasonable valuation much closer to $20 than $30 in the near term, although since Ackman is looking for good growth it will probably have potential to go much higher over the next few years.

But warrants for long term aren't a great value on this since they're so highly priced - you'd need $32 share price just to break even, and then another $9 to double your money.
I appreciate these reminders

“In July 2007, Prince told the Financial Times that global liquidity was enormous and only a significant disruptive event could create difficulty in the leveraged buyout market. "As long as the music is playing, you've got to get up and dance," he said. "We're still dancing.”

Housing manias take years to work themselves out. I don’t know if there could be a dip in ‘21, but I expect buyers can absorb the shock if it’s so soon. Id be more concerned about a crash if liquidity changes or there is a solvency crisis (probably in the CRE space)

@ E6
what’s your day job
As a real estate developer, your logic makes sense, but you need prices to crash in order to create a dead end for forbearances and this the rush to zero for the masses. In an appreciative market seller will just sell rather than go into foreclosure, and lenders will extended to ensure that happens.

The only thing that will create a change in price is a change in supply or demand. Right now builders are rushing to add more supply, so the set up is there. However, overall permit data this year (new supply) is consistent with 2013 levels. E are not yet seeing the hockey sticks of 05-06, which created the over supply that worsened the crash.

I have a few rentals and am looking to sell as well. Real estate has been on a tear, and although we expected a breather, we think COVID solved it.

Not to mention the BFR guys make up a good portion of new permits and are absorbing a ton of SF homes and putting them into shadow inventory.

I am bullish on development and home building for the next 2-3 years.
Me too.  This money trains stop Monday when I buy in.
We have a new crew coming in, though I agree rates will stay near-zero regardless. Interesting point to consider.
Ok you’ve sufficiently guilted me. I’m sorry
I'm 27 and fucked ~25 girls. All sucked, never orgasmed once. Quality>quantity. My confidence has gone up a lot though, so can now go after hotter chicks but that has only been through trial and failure with the first ~25 or so girls. I don't know your perspective however, you still might be confident even though you didn't trial and fail. But for me the trial and failure was necessary. I did go after girls who probably would have made me orgasm but didn't have the game to get them, now I do.

Retail isn’t a trash business model. Brand equity is a powerful thing. Ryan can just shut down every store and convert 2/3 of the customer base to shop online, drive marketing investment and keep inking digital revenue sharing deals like the one $gme did with Microsoft with Sony and Nintendo and it’ll be slick af. That customer base is super valuable. They all intend and do shop for video games only.

Okay, so we build an entire platform for GME to host eSports, and that does what? I am not asking to be pedantic or rude; I genuinely want to know how this makes them money.

Here's Twitch (https://help.twitch.tv/s/article/joining-the-affiliate-program?language=en_US) the affiliate program. Does GME have the clout to get people like this and then pay them with the starting off the ground? As posted they aren't balls deep into the R&D for this so it's not as if they decided they have an infinite project fund for it.

As for phones and such and the expansion of their electronic offerings that's tough; they are competing with people we aren't even talking about like Walmart. Seriously. There's little that isn't touched by a much larger whale in the industry.

The way we came into this current rental property was my wife bought it before we were married. Its not like its an almost paid off piece of property that was a super low mortgage. If this was more of a classic rental situation where the ROI was higher, I'd feel differently.

I have a great job but sales during covid sucks. I’ve found myself a lot more complacent and lacking drive. Depending on your age I’d say take the risk and do what you enjoy because work is life so the balance has to be found doing something you enjoy.
You don’t need to have it figured out. You just need a job that looks good. Consultants don’t have anything figured out, but make careers out of it.
I ain't seeing no Benjamins coming out of that printer.
Fuck Clemson!
Because moving stock costs money. You can't just load up one other store with double the merchandise because then eventually they will have to have a sale just to liquidate it. Which means you will lose even more money since you just paid to have it all sent over. That also means you have to pay to do inventory instead of just selling it. You could allocate it to several stores, but then you are paying to move it around to several places and you have to pay someone to figure out which stores need what stuff or you risk the same situation of loading up one store with too much of the same piece of merchandise. You also have a whole accounting hassle, you have to figure out how to allocate which costs to which store and figure out how much of the costs from the closing store are going to be allocated to the other stores. It's easier and cheaper just to liquidate it all.
Or like Blockbuster.

Hey retards, if you bought at the top of that drawing of Mount Everest, where the stock tripled for the first time, you’re still retarded. That doesn’t change anything about PLTR. Timing & retards that do literally ZERO research while believing whatever they read on scam “stock” websites are why pltr is fluctuating. PLTR gained steam just as the wave of SPACS IPO’s started and then TESLA entered the S&P. The big Funds and firms have a set amount of capital to invest, so when all of these new companies go public that forces these huge investment companies to sell a portion of their current position to buy shares of the new stock. 

That all happened at the end of this crazy year where people have no clue if taxes are going to DOUBLE or not. Lots of People took profits. 

And guess what, PLTR is signing new contracts every week. Nobody is reporting them.

You have to factor in the likelihood of profit. This seems so oversold especially since the earnings a month ago showed insane growth. The bet is that the market is overreacting a lot to the lockup expiration. It’s deep itm so the chance of losing money here is so small which is why profit is obviously smaller

1) Trash quality DD on vaccines considering how incredibly wrong you were. 

2) We agree

3) cruises taken this winter are higher than expectations

Generally speaking, CCL is highly volatile but the hard fact is that my DD ended up being MORE accurate in terms of conclusion, which you deemed trash while being incredibly wrong on vaccines. Although I wasn’t right that the vaccines were not FDA approved by the election, several of them were approved before the end of the year and millions of Americans have already been vaccinated. 

My stance was a bullish one but imo underestimating the power of the free market and the competition it creates, especially in a global situation like this, is foolish. The notion that time restraints and timelines apply to major corporations receiving billions of dollars is state and federal aid is one which has been largely rejected through the history of the United States and free market capitalism. 

The news could not know more than you, other than maybe a few inside sources, however from a company standpoint, it makes ZERO sense for a company to say “we are going to have the vaccine by the end of the year!” It might cause a temporary jump in their stock price but it would go tumbling down lower than prior to the announcement because they missed expectations.

It's funny how many ways people try to spin this positively. Closing stores is not a good thing. Sure closing non profitable stores is better then keeping them open and losing money, but the fact that you have stores not making a profit is not a good thing. There is no way to spin that positively. It's like saying the cancer is good because it's operable. Like great, if I have to have cancer, that's good that it can be cured, but I'd rather not have it at all.

You got to starve the pigs for a few days, then the sight of a chopped-up body will look like curry to a pisshead. You gotta shave the heads of your victims, and pull the teeth out for the sake of the piggies' digestion. You could do this afterwards, of course, but you don't want to go sievin' through pig shit, now do you? They will go through bone like butter. You need at least sixteen pigs to finish the job in one sitting, so be wary of any man who keeps a pig farm. They will go through a body that weighs 200 pounds in about eight minutes. That means that a single pig can consume two pounds of uncooked flesh every minute. Hence the expression, "as greedy as a pig."

Yeah for sure I think it’s part of the 5% that could be a meme but could be plausible. So essentially Warren Buffet was born during the Great Depression and during this time people were losing faith In the stock market. 

So the theory suggests that Warren Buffett and all of his assets, backstory and image are owned by the US government. This explains his frugal lifestyle such as living in a average town house and eating a McDonald’s.

It was thought that the idea of investing wouldn’t be popular with the boomers because of the uncertainty. So they fabricated Warren Buffets backstory and success to regain confidence in the stock market among youth.

Warren buffet nowadays is one of the most influential and popular « rag to riches » story in the investing community. Many people thank their interest of investing and trading to Warren Buffet and I would imagine his story is what keeps fresh meat inflowing into the market these past decades. Not totally outlandish tbh let me know what you think.

Wow you are a retard. You dont know how selling short works? You have to borrow the shares and pay interest. GME is a very expensive company to short. Also shorting you can only make 100% it is better to just buy good companies that can 5x or 10x your money. Gme is not one of them

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/wallstreetbets) if you have any questions or concerns.*
I've been seriously exploring this as well.  


Timing I see for foreclosures to start getting into the swing of things is around August of 2021, and picking up momentum from there.  


How bad will the overall real estate markets get hit as a result?  The answer is - it depends.  


On the one hand, I can see residential real estate in areas like Manhattan or downtown Los Angeles taking a serious hit, while the telecommuters flee to anywhere in The Hinterlands, USA where the internet connection is warm, sparky, and fast.  


On the other hand, I personally live in a resort town where many of the houses here are second, third, or seventh homes and are only occupied a few days out of the year.    


Will they be bought up by the fleeing telecommuters as the current owners start to list them for top dollar before the foreclosures hit the market?  Or, will the absentee owners simply move into them full time, selling their places in the large cities where they're currently living?  


Finally, the wild card - unemployment.   the numbers are hard to track (once one stops filing for UI, one is no longer counted toward the overall unemployment numbers), but a lot of jobs which were lost due to COVID aren't coming back.  


Ergo, there's a shitload of folks who are unemployed who will remain unemployed for the foreseeable future, and if they've been deferring payments on their dwellings and once all protections expire, folks will be hitting the streets.  


If they're homeowners, that means foreclosures.  If they're renters, that means...well, that means their landlords may be able to evict them and get in  tenants who will pay.  


Thing is - who are those tenants gonna be?  The former homeowners?  After they lose their homes, their credit will be for shit.   Would you, as a landlord, rent to them - especially if you have to start the eviction process on them almost immediately as they have no jobs and no income to pay rent, much less a house payment?  You'd be willing to try this just after you've just gone through eviction with your last tenants?  


Regardless of how it all plays out, I see a serious reshuffling of the deck starting around August 2021, and extending on into 2022.    


If one is sitting on a pile of cash, there may be deals to be had.  Really sweet deals.  Plan accordingly.
We need the office back on Netflix wtf is this shit
Huh, well I'd like to catch that wave. Maybe I should sell later in the summer...

Fuck that, I'll get pennies for way too much risk. If I sold some 630 p, for instance, I'd barely get anything. If Tesla were to tank I would never be able to get out of it. I'd be stuck holding those pennies until expiration because they'd be worth more than what I sold them for. If I knew they'd keep climbing I'd sell something close to strike but I just don't see them staying above 700 for the next month.

The economy was roaring when it entered the pandemic, and the fed have pulled out all the stops to mitigate the damage. There’s been confusion as to how there’s been such an increase in liquidity, consumer confidence, and home purchases instead of  savings. The truth is that this pandemic harmed the low income earners the most. So although there maybe be a foreclosure and eviction spike, it will be absorbed by the upper tiers. 

It’s morbid but I’m actually eager to pick up some cheap property. It’s nearly impossible to find real estate in some areas, and it raises the value of even the crappiest properties. Homes in my area are purchased above asking price within a week or two of hitting the market. It’s nuts.

Best 2021 long Plays?? My guess is IIPR, GOOG, and FB
Literally what signals are bears going off of today?
RSI to see overbought/oversold level so i don't FOMO in right before a pullback

MACD & VWAP... I'd be lying if i said i had a perfect understanding of these and how to interpret them. It's wild to see how often prices will bounce right off these lines, but I often notice that stock price strongly breaking through one or both of these lines signals the price is about to move further in that direction. 

If you get similar signals from all of these at the same time, all signals are GO
I’m a simple man, I see Gainshop.org ,I upvote
VW was once the most valuable company on earth...

It’s relevant if people are saying they are the next FAANG. People are not comparing them with Pharma companies. With current hype and euphoria in the market, there’s potential for a bubble. There were dozens of companies in the dot com bubble selling real products and making real breakthroughs. But because of euphoria people stoped doing DD before investing. If you can’t see the same thing happening now, you are the moron. Thanks for insulting me! Love it

I think that % was referring to the housing market and not a return on his investment. If it went above like 9% or whatever it was, then the whole housing market would crash.

The over-extended point makes sense. People do seem to be more responsible. Most of the real estate I see being bought it by rich people who turn everything into a rental. There aren't a ton of people owning a home. This is a good point.

True, very true. If I had the cash instead of the house, do you think I would make more in the markets or owning the house? My boomer 401k has better returns on average than this house has appreciated over the same time frame. I have renters paying the mortgage, but real estate prices are stabilizing in my area. And to get really good people in the house, we aren't charging top dollar, so I'm not making more than a 10k a year on this thing, plus appreciation. Its a $600k house. The ROI is shit right now considering the liability. I think regardless of my thesis above, I want less liability.
Don’t forget to hedge your PLTR calls with longer dated PLTR calls... that is how hedging works... right?

This is pretty cute, actually.
are you up for a permaban bet from wsb?
It’s guaranteed money, but you cap your upside potential and still have the normal risk of holding the stock, which could plummet. This hedges that loss potential by lowering the cost basis of your shares, but again caps that upside potential as well. If you sell 25 calls and it goes to 30, you still only get 25. In this case, you still make money but “lose” the opportunity to have made more money
Correct - they're all too far behind. Instead of a position of losing EV TAM they are having to gain EV TAM which is much harder than trying to retain it. $GM being far more aggressive than $TM with Hummer EV. $F also pushing out an E150. $TM is so late and their models are not attractive over the other options.

Not necessarily and limiting your position size is going to hinder your ability to make 100% in a year on selling otm puts. The entire market does have down swings, so even if you are diversified you can still wipe out a large portion of your gains. Everyone thinks theta gang is the way to go until they see the majority of their gains wiped in one bad downturn.

I think we can handle one more moonshot here. Some of the indicators don't make me feel that great though. SPY weekly RSI is almost as high as it was the week of Aug 24th. Money flow has been pretty crap and has been making lower peaks.

I think the overall bullish sentiment is keeping us going right now. We could easily moon for a week or something, but a sentiment change would fuck us pretty hard right now. Not really useful to try to time it, because when in doubt, market goes up. But either a small correction or just a -1.5% day has to be around the corner soon
Every automaker has slept on EVs.  You dont think they went got hungry and want blood after what TSLA did? They need to get the battery tech done and 🚀🚀🚀. They have also been working on solid-state batteries which blow li-ion out of your mothers gooch.

I likened that to missiles and Raytheon, then you went off the deep end with that because you're either trolling or just plain dumb, lol.

Finally, the guy said "genomics is a bubble like the dot com bubble". No, it's obviously not, as none of these companies are about to go bankrupt. They are selling real products and making real breakthroughs and even if their stock prices come down in the short term, it doesn't mean theyre going bust like dotcom era companies, which had no actual viable business underneath the hype -- that's the key distinction you dummies are missing

Their app is another thing, I couldn’t access something unless I logged into my account from the website. Where as the app would never let me access it while logged into the account.

Was working with limited capital. Wkhs got close to 30$ and my shares finally got called away. Around that time I also started opening positions in GME, and now I'm overweight in that. If I had more capital in my 'speculation' account, I would highly consider running a wheel on wkhs again based on current prices. I didn't mind getting assigned to buy wkhs at 15-18$ a share, but not so much when it was high 20's. I think wkhs is a good wheel candidate though bc the premiums are healthy and the stock seems pretty range bound until they finally get positive usps contract news.

FSD is the real deal. The AI is doing things that are extremely advanced and very difficult to do in AI or expert system. This demonstrates a high level of model sophistication, training data, depth, and tagging. I'll highlight a couple of examples. Anticipating intent. Stopping for a pedestrian, not immediately as they stood there, and not because they were in a crosswalk. But once they took a step towards the crosswalk. This means they have modeled the intent of objects to move and also where they will move. Avoiding potholes, and road debris is less impressive, but also demonstrates diverse object recognition. The current beta is orders of magnitude better than the one from a few months ago. It looks to me like the big players either took a technological dead end by choosing lidar, or do not currently have the data and don't have an AI model sufficiently advanced to get to where Tesla is right now. The data and tagging will take years to catch up to Tesla. They also need a sufficiently advanced model. The data and tagging comes first. I fully expect other vendors to catch up at some point. But Tesla's lead is huge.
That’s what they said about pltr

I’ve been waiting to get into housing in a city and got 1.1m saved, but at this point I’ll just keep renting. If the zoning laws ever change, it would affect the prices heavily.

At risk of pissing off the PSTH pumper fanboys: ***The "tontine" structure is a garbage fiction invented by Ackman to benefit himself.***

It has one purpose and one purpose only - to keep the price higher than the NAV (the $20/share cash money in escrow paid in by the spac IPO buyers) so that there are no redemptions that would mess up Ackman's deal.

For those unfamiliar with spacs - redemptions only happen when the price of the spac falls below the NAV price - then people will buy for the lower value and trade the shares in for the value of the money they represent in the trust.  So imagine you could buy PSTH for $19 because everyone hated it, and then trade it back to Ackman for $20 of the cash the early IPO investors put into his escrow account.  That's a redemption.

If the price stays significantly above $20 then no one redeems, they'd just sell the shares to some other trader for the market price, since that's more than they'd get by redeeming.

&nbsp;

The tontine structure claims you'll get extra warrants if people redeem their shares, but that's a totally fictional concept because no one is going to redeem, because of the warrants attached to the stock until merger.  Here's where the Ackman magic comes in:  Normally spacs trade as "Units" and then they split into warrants and stock.

In a typical situation it would look something like this: 1 Unit gets split into 1 stock and 3/9 warrants - so for every 3 units you have you get 3 stock and 1 warrant - fractional warrants disappear.  Well what Ackman did is leave 1/9 warrants on the units and move 2/9 of the warrants to the stock.  So the first split only created 1/3 of the warrants that will be available.  The other 2/9 will detach from the stock during the merger with the target company.

The trick is that those 2/9 warrants now have a much higher value than they normally would because there's demand for warrants and not very many of them - supply and demand drives the warrant prices up.  So now you have $20 NAV in stock, plus $2 in fractional warrants attached to the stock.  ***There's basically no way the price can go below NAV to be redeemed, because the value of the stock with the fractional warrants attached will always be far above NAV.***

&nbsp;

So what's the benefit to the investor?  There isn't one.  The only benefit to "tontine" structure was that if people redeemed their fractional warrants would be shared among the remaining investors. But since the price can't go below NAV, no one redeems, so it's a fictional proposition.

The downside is that it sucks for both serious investors and novice investors. It sucks for the novice investors because they're saddled with 2/9 warrants that they don't understand and probably won't handle in the most profitable way. These aren't free, the novice still has to pay the extra $2/share inflated price of the commons, and there's a risk that the warrants will be worth less when they get them because there will be 3x as many on the market suddenly.

It sucks for the serious investors because the warrants are overpriced which kills the leverage benefits, and the commons force you to buy warrants you may not want in your trading strategy.  The only people it doesn't suck for are people that want the exact ratio of 9 shares and 2 warrants.  That's a weird target ratio and I doubt anyone specifically desires that.

&nbsp;

TLDR: Ackman rigged the spac for his own benefit, and it's had the unintended consequence of skyrocketing the price because of a feedback loop between warrant demand and stock price.  The money value of a share is $20, and right now you're going to pay 38% more than that if you want one (28% if you can manage to sell the warrants for $9 later on when they split at merger).

If you think that premium is worth it then invest, but know that ***you're investing in a pile of cash on the hope that Ackman finds an exciting target and someone is willing to pay you an even higher premium for your shares - shares that Ackman himself has deemed are worth $20.*** (that's the value he will negotiate with the target company, not the current stock price)
It depends on the FED. If we see inflation and a forced raise in rates, it could cause a sell off with no buyers.

No. In fact that's kind of the interesting part. Stocks dual reflect two things; the first is the interest of the public at a moment in time and the second is the performance of a company across time; so when GME was $4 in Aug it meant two things: 1. No one cared it existed and 2. It was doing poorly; because stocks have these dualistic natures 1 or 2, not 1 and 2, are always possible plays. Same with GE.

I mean didn’t globalization make us rich though?? The only difference is none of that wealth is making it in the hands of our poorest citizens. I feel for those manufacturing cities like those in the Midwest that have become crime-ridden but I don’t think it’s wise to shift back to a manufacturing-based economy. Most developed countries are service-based economies, they just take care of their citizens better. Agreed that the costs of healthcare, college, etc. are ridiculous though and we do need to help those in the Midwest, I just don’t think bringing back manufacturing is the way to do it. It could be good to manufacture more essentials though in the case of another pandemic or war or whatever, but we can probably leave most consumer goods to other countries

He is wrong. The dot com bust involved a lot of flimsy bubble companies going bankrupt and ceasing to exist.

I just explained that these companies are actually selling real products, and rapidly expanding their portfolios.  That is not at all like the dot com bust. 

I also said yes, short term companies might be inflated, and they could come down. Yeah that could fuck your 6 month calls up, but this is an easy long term bet. 5 years out you will be kicking yourself for dismissing it as a dot com bubble. Terrible take.

Well, you understand it's really an issue about price gouging and the only effective plan that has worked worldwide is for the government to step in and fix drug prices so that manufacturers can't keep raising prices all the time.

All of this is anecdotal but I work within the industry (as a technology provider). In many markets across the country there is a severe lack of inventory which has given us the current seller’s market we’re in. Unfortunately this hasn’t coincided with the all-time low interest rates that would get many buyers into homes. During the pandemic there’s been an immense demand for refinance as many borrowers have been able to capture much lower rates than what they previously have had. Most of my mortgage clients have had incredible years because of the demand for a refinance. Personally, I believe that we’ll see the following happen:

1. People who didn’t buy a house during the pandemic out of fear will come out in full force once it’s largely under control. 
2. Builders nationwide will be ramping up efforts to build as many houses as possible. Lack of inventory has created high appreciation values in many markets. 
3. As rates will stay low, combined with borrowers who didn’t buy during the pandemic combined with a rise in inventory, I predict more houses will be bought in 2021 than in 2020. 

Again, this is all anecdotal and this information comes from what our company collects as well as conversations with clients and prospects that are real estate agents and loan officers.

AI  simulates what stocks will move and which will dump etc. Suggest that AI  controls the market and not people buying and selling. I like this one a  lot.

I've been going to that conference for years. This year will be different given COVID but I expect a lot of announcements in January. Hopefully GILD buyout for $75+ per share is one. If not, I do think a lot of bad news has been priced in and digested by the market so GILD shares could just grind up slowly until more positive cancer portfolio news comes up

Yikes this is a super dumb take. The sector might be fairly inflated short term, but these companies are actually growing revenues quickly, and the rate of innovation is blowing up. There is still a fuckload of biology that remains unknown, which means there is a ton of discovery ahead and money to be made. 

These companies aren't going anywhere but up. Whether the stock prices keep going up short-mid term who knows, but long term this is a slam dunk. Not all companies in ARKG will necessarily succeed or hit it big but the space as a whole has massive room to grow, and it will grow.

Lol it's kinda sad
Consider the value of properties right now and the interest rates? When interest rates go back up, we will have people who are stagnant on home values. They traded growth for leverage this year on lower rates with inflated pricing.

My guess is somewhere between 2025-2035 housing will remain flat on growth assuming interest goes up again.

I am not disagreeing with anything you said. I am not a fan of the insurance...why not have one entity that handles it all. Like Medicare!!

I have been on Obamacare and I believed in it. I am talking from experience here about slapping a government insurance on top of a crooked system. The ACA offers worse plans each year due to the rising and uncontrollable costs from the medical system. It’s not the ACA’s fault. 

I will take the plan pitched by Bernie (voted for him in the primaries). The tax details...it’s not a big deal. Any tweaks are OK. Not when you compare it with a surprise bill you can’t pay.

Tesla Model Y MIC surpassed 100K orders within 10 hrs. Let's extrapolate this number. With 2021 guidance "predicted" to be in the ballpark of 750K - 850K, I believe this number is low. As a result, I anticipate guidance to be much higher, to around 1M, perhaps more. You can guess what happens to a stock when guidance is revised upwards during Earnings.

do you need to sink thousands of dollars in to your stonks in property tax and maintenance?
Also Facebook is illegally scraping data from people’s phones, so they will be fine for now. But when they get caught maybe they will actually get hit with something real
So supply is low, demand is high, more people are buying homes at competitive bids, home value is rising as a result creating a strong sellers market, and you predict a value crash? These foreclosed homes (if it occurs on a scale you believe) will rapidly be scooped up by buyers.
Have you guys noticed how when bulls make fun of bears, it’s kinda playful and sarcastic calling them 🌈🐻 and shit. But when bears attack bulls, it’s like suuuuuuper aggressive and like wishes death to your unborn child? It’s no longer playful nor sarcastic. It’s kinda scary how rabid they get. I mean, I don’t wanna generalize and say all bears, but....
Thanks. End of Jan.

I hate how im down a few thousand when?I couldve just bought Tesla any week of this year and made money. Hell I coulve just had all my money under my mattress until yesterday morning and I would be up.
yes... looks like there's a bounce coming... but I'd have to actually do some shit to figure out the timing.
tbf, they started working w/ ncmec since 2010 and signed a contract w/ ICE in 2014.  It wasn't until 2015 when they had a full implementation going.  I learned some of this stuff doing DD prior to the PLTR \*DPO.

ICE actually has two completely separate divisions in what they do in terms of business function/responsibility/jackasses running it: 

* HSI, Homeland security investigations, they look for foreign criminals and criminal acts.
* ERO, Enforcement and Removal Operations, they having nothing better to do than deport people who don't have citizenships.

Originally the contract was only to support HSI.  They were working on breaking up importation violations w/ CBP, Customs and Border Protection (under the DHS umbrella that ICE also exists under along w/ secret service, OIG, Coast Guard, TSA, FEMA, USCIS) and work w/ local LE to identify people in criminal rings in illegal importation of drugs, non-CARB legal Skyline GT-Rs, Silvias, AE86s, and other drift cars, gang/cartel activity including human trafficking.

ERO got a hard-on (erection/sexual arousal) when they found out about Palantir's capabilities and walked over to their HSI buddy cubicles and started shoulder surfing PLTR and eventually just taking over by using the platform for their own investigations.

This all began under the Obama administration.  So I mean, I get that the United States should be developing best in class stuff so we can keep up with foreign governments.  But it speaks volumes that our administration (bipartisan) would do this kind of BS.

Like China has MiningLamp which is supposed to be a data analytics platform comparable to Palantir.  And now w/ the stolen F35 lightning plans, they have their own facsimile (look up the Shenyang J31).  So "foreign adversaries" aka "foreign trade partners" are on the same or similar level to us, blame foreign espionage, blame globalism, if humanity was equal in terms of tech and trade, there'd be no problem.

If we're really pissed off about the comings and goings of the United States' actions, we should dump the assholes in Congress, Senate, and Executive leadership to figure out a way that doesn't involve inciting revolution, installing shill gov'ts, and drone bombing people the opposition to keep a hold on oil.  

Data analysis platforms are just going to get more important as the years go by.  Data analysis has been the next gold rush for the past decade and a half with Facebook, Google, Amazon, Oracle, AdTech, Medical Research, and other companies using the data to streamline operations, manufacturing, production, research, and sales.  

*Punishing Palantir for witchcraft is akin to fearing doctors because bloodletting used to be a thing.*

**Palantir is going to the moon first** before everyone else cuz they were fucking *tits deep* in this stuff since 2004.  And they'll continue to be tits deep before anyone even gets balls deep.

It's like Tesla and electric vehicles.  

Only now is GM (Nikola lol), Ford (Rivian), and other manufacturers trying to get in.  But Tesla's bottom up approach, listening to consumers, is destroying all the other car manufacturers (because traditional big AF car companies do a top down approach by having marketing teams making assumptions of what consumers really care about).

Ultimately, we don't need to shill WSB to get people to invest, we're already doing that.  What is important is to help "Main street" understand the implications.  Palantir has a bipartisan pass.  AOC is raising concerns, but is doing it for clout.  If she was in a presidential position, she'd be riding the PLTR Train to the moon too.

PLTR doesn't need rockets to get to the moon.  They built the fucking railroad to get there.

Commercial real estate crash? Probably, at least a reduction in values

Residential real estate crash? Unlikely. Probably foreclosures and whatnot but I don’t think it will drive down prices too much. Plus it doesn’t seem like everyone is so overleveraged on their mortgages like in 2007.

The fukin comments just show how people should learn technicals , Amazon has the same exact chart and blew up for two days . I was fortunate to buy the low point before Amazon broke out of its wedge and that’s what this autist  is talking about . With Amazon I turned a few contracts worth 350 into nearly 3000 because they were dirt cheap , the contracts are turning cheap with Nvidia and its in a tighter wedge than your face mask and cheesy upper lip. Nvidia news is coming , it’s going to be epic for a day or two and give some lucky people a chance to make a thousand percent plays once it breaks out of the wedge .

I was agreeing with you up until insurance. Yes, insurance is an issue. He specifically addresses that insurance agencies aren't the bad guys, they don't decide prices on drugs. Why is that though ? Because they really can't do that or they'll get fucked by drug makers and have deals set in place. If you need insurance and a drug you need isn't covered , you're not really going to stay with your provider. By eliminating private insurance , those drug companies now only deal with the US government and it has all the fucking leverage. That means either you agree to whatever the government agrees is fair price or you fuck off and lose all business while the government just makes a generic version to provide instead. Price gouging is real as you've mentioned. Bernie himself makes trips over the border to Canada and ferries people to buy the same drug ( same company, brand, effectiveness) that is sometimes 10x cheaper. These people visibly cry as they stock up on months worth of their prescriptions. Maybe those people really aren't as uneducated as you happen to believe. 

 M4A is a 4% income premium that excludes the first 29k for a small family. I think where you got your payroll figure is from employer costs (still way off) where they would be taxed 7.5% of payroll, not 15%. Average figures show that replacing that cost as opposed to employee insurance for the whole family saves employers money. Thinking the current system will cost more is ridiculous. Once the government lowers drug costs, you can work out better budgets. It wouldn't bankrupt the US or workers because every other industrialized nation has a massive public healthcare system

Made 1,500% return on SPCE calls and then puts on that first run. Turned it all into SH calls that expire the day (roughly) Robinhood crashes real hard and we hit circuit breakers. Would’ve been like $400–>$15,000 in a month on calculated plays, not meme magic bullshit.  Lost all of it lmao. 

Made it all back with VALE and FCEL calls (still holding VALE). Edu stocks are next

10000% this. It's mind blowing to me how retarded people are with this stock. It's just as brain dead as the people who are like "hurr hurr GME = Blockbuster". Anyone who seriously thinks DASH is a good short is just flat out not looking at the reality of what they are doing.

And you didn't even touch on the fact that DoorDash is beginning to expand into the non-food delivery world. They just got contracts with WalMart and CVS, and are looking to keep pushing into the e-commerce world. There's already doordash drivers out there delivering TVs. Plus DASH is easily winning in the food delivery space. They just went from 20% marketshare to over 50% in less than a year.

I am also newb. I do agree that there will be a dip in 2021. But let me play some devil's advocate. I kept hearing about this housing market crash since 2015 and as of now, it didn't happen. Unlike many other assets, there are only finite amount of land and houses that has utilities and roads and are not part of conservation. With inflation coming, people will have more money to bid of the price.

You really have to consider the flight from the cities in this analysis. My question is will the demand remain high during the period where prices are increasing. If you buy into the line that professionals from the city fleeing to suburbs because it’s now easier than ever to work from home, that could be a tailwind for the housing market as opposed to the headwind you are predicting. I think you hold the rental house on the chance the demand for it will skyrocket over the next year. If it doesn’t then at least your wife’s boyfriend will have a place to stay.

The stimulus package was only designed to boost the economy, it wasn't meant for food/rent, it was meant for frivolous purchases designed to increase sales and stop the economy from "halting." People kept mistaking the purpose and thought money was meant for essential purchases like food/rent for months and months and months. The rest of the covid benifit (EI increase, wage subsidies, etc) was meant for that, but the media censored it all. They wanted people to be angry.

And now you got tons of very angry people claiming it's not enough, when literally no other country gave most citizens money in the same way for the same purpose.

According to the sub having 0 competitive advantage in a market is actually very bullish
I mean, the EI increase was meant to help the poor. The rest of the covid fund was dedicated to helping the poor. 

The stimulus package was only designed to boost the economy, it wasn't meant for food/rent, it was meant for frivolous purchases designed to increase sales and stop the economy from "halting."

But retards don't understand this, and ACTUALLY BELIEVED that the money was meant for essential purchases like food/rent for months and months and months. Yes, the average american is retarded. 

Every time an expert explained the purpose of the stimulus on the news, they were censored or cut off.

I feel like the rich just take advantage of us. They know we either work or starve but they have absoloutly no obligation to us. The politicians all own stocks in these companies and pretend that they actually care about us but just like bezos, have no real responsibility to us. They need the poor to stay poor so they can do their dirty work, enriching themselves even further. Im terrified of being stuck at the bottom but thats freedom 🤷‍♂️

I was at GME for close to an hour doing some DD...so many customers during heavy rain. To the point that I spent most of the time on sidelines just listening to the interactions.

Most customers were turned away because they didn’t have that game for newer consoles or product in stock. But they’d check to see what closer store may have it...

The employee managed to sell a used Switch (dock/animal crossing version) for $280 + other accessories. The customer did manage to save $50 between certificates and rewards points...so they only paid $290ish at the end of the transaction. 

Nonetheless, a used switch was sold in a generic box. 

Now the customer was a big retard because that was the 3rd time he was buying a switch after selling the previous 2...who knows he could be a savant as he may be flipping them. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Does seem like they're experiencing supply shortfalls from all the in-store DD the GME Gang continues conducting. And the launch slates for software aren't mind blowing, so the good news is they bundled almost all the consoles they sold. The bad news is Covid reduced foot-traffic (and higher margin collectibles attachment, in all likelihood). FWIW the e-commerce order rate at [GameStop.com](https://GameStop.com) was 3.13M in November vs. 3.15M in December.

I don't understand the pessimism against Gamestop.

Just consider:  
It's 2021. We're in the middle of a worldwide pandemic that destroys physical retailing. But even before that, we've seen years of sharp decline in Brick-and-mortar. Despite all that, Gamestop is still around! And there are so many ways to actually improve business.
The defense spending bill was just passed by the Senate. This is after a veto. Anyone here think that defense companies will pop on Monday as a result?  Lockheed, Raytheon, or any of those types of companies?

Ever since I had founded Wallstreet Bets my life has changed. I had a pretty dreadful year going through series of depression, lost friendships, hardships through life, and had gone through a bad breakup, 2020 sucked the life out of me. 

When I discovered WSB during around the time I had just got into the stock market in January just last year I laughed at all the memes, joined the community by following the subreddit, posting and more. I felt a sense of happiness that I haven't felt in a long time. I met some amazing people, learned the dos and don'ts about stock trading, and now my portfolio has risen from a $500 investment up to $15k.

This community brought a sense of joy that I had been missing. From the bottom of my heart, thank you.

I'm just learning so someone correct me if I'm wrong but penny stocks are OTC so you need a platform that supports OTC trading. Since it's one of the more popular/ well known platforms I'll say that Robinhood does not support OTC trading.

Nice little return so far. Don’t let go. Falcon PSTH is fuelling up
1. To be honest I’m not sure. I never expected him to go above 10%, since I thought he declined the board seat so that he could retain the flexibility to sell. He also can’t afford to buy out the whole company. You obviously have way more experience than me on M&A. Maybe he decided it was worth it to go for the gold and wishes he had done so earlier? Personally I think he’ll take an activist role but I don’t see him buying up the rest of the company.

2. PlayStation outsold Xbox 2 to 1 so they’re probably more than 1/3 of the market

3. That’s fair. 

You’re right that Ryan seems to be heavily invested in this company. I’m surprised he went above 10%, and that is a huge point for him to keep in acquiring. 

Anyways, I love seeing large bets with a ton of conviction. I’m a 🌈🐻. But good luck on this one, hope it works out.
On my way there

I’m trying to change how you string words together, so many grammatical inefficiencies and errors though
the purpose was not to rub it in their face. It was to show that when money is being printed wildy b/itcoin is the quickest asset to go up. The reason most people are poor is because they are on a fiat standard. It seems that you didn't know that b/itcoin is the social justice currency and financial reform that would help everyday people in a lot of respects.

Here is the [majority of good news ](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/ko2i9h/juicy_gme_dd_reason_behind_icr_change/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)that Sherman will be pulling out of his ass. 

I’ll try to dig deeper into finding out about the upcoming holiday numbers, but as of right now, the consensus is that he will say “we have a strong presence, ok numbers for holiday **considering the pandemic**” ... as of right now it’s leaning towards a “dip in numbers bc of pandemic but everyone has dipped.”

I’ll have to dig deeper to see if the consensus has changed... who knows, maybe Sherman will come out there and say “we have dramatically increased memberships and there is a new wave of loyal customers...”

Can’t think of what / who may be responsible for that... but they probably haven’t even noticed yet.

There’s sites where you can see the last price someone paid for your exact card. But you would have to send them off to get graded by a company before you could even get a chance at selling one.

It’s almost comical how you can be there for someone when they have nothing, accept them, get them help and be the reason they got an education, only for them to when they’re just about to be done, tell you that you don’t have your shit together and leave you (I do have severe social anxiety and don’t feel comfortable interacting and leaving my house, and I have had really bad mental health and refuse to get help, and I have wasted the last 3 years pretty much, but still just what the fuck)....

“Robinhood” “Dumb Money” all are used in conjunction with WSB in Mainstream News. They are interchangeable at this point.

The initial TD notice did state that.  But on Friday 12/31/20, TD sent a new notice.  Their liquidity partners will not allow the securities blacklisted listed to be traded. 

But you don't have to take my word for it (call your broker, I did). 

&#x200B;

Dear Valued Client, 

 We recently wrote to let you know that you currently hold one or more of the restricted securities impacted by the executive order signed by President Trump on November 12, 2020. **We've received notification from our liquidity providers that they may not accept transactions in shares of the associated securities starting on January 5, 2021, which is earlier than the January 11, 2021 federal deadline.** 

Therefore, you will have until market close on **Monday, January 4, 2021** to liquidate these securities.    The [executive order](https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/executive-order-addressing-threat-securities-investments-finance-communist-chinese-military-companies/) prohibits the purchase or holding of any securities that invest in mainland Chinese companies with ties to the military of the People's Republic of China (CCMCs\*). A full list of restricted companies and/or funds can be found [here](https://www.tdameritrade.com/retail-en_us/resources/pdf/TDA101484.pdf).  **Action Required in Your Account** 

&#x200B;

It's a good choice I think. Going for ICLN leaps myself. I look at QQQJ 25c 6/18 or something like that to buy after. Sadly QQQJ doesn't have 2022 calls and that it's a new fund with low liquidity.

The primary reason is the short interest being the highest in stock market history.
Long (debit) vertical spreads do not have a margin requirement. Long debit spreads need to be fully paid. However, cash accounts cannot trade vertical spreads.

Found this. Hmm

2) PlayStation is 1/3 of the market at best. And many PS games are still sold through third party retailers.
3) don’t know where $gme will go from here but I know a lot of value will be built by RC and co in transitioning it into the next e-commerce play in video games.

Thanks for the insight too, not too knowledgeable about different option styles. Bought my first spread (call debit) Yesterday. still kind of nervous on how it works on the sell call side because I don’t have the scratch to cover if I were to get assigned but as a spread I will most likely sell the spread early. Is it possible to get assigned on one leg of a spread?

They are weird. Just don’t think about it too hard.
Dollars are just our arbitrary measurement of your value to society.

Either you reject money *and* society or you find a way to benefit society and that’s how you make money.

It’s only considered kneeling if you’re selfish enough to think that you’re entitled to money without benefitting society.

“But what about the stock market?”

Your investment into large public companies is valuable to the companies which you invest in, whose goal is to benefit society in some way and consequently make money.

I bought a debit spread on RIOT, bought a 19c and sold a 25c. My max loss is the debit I paid. But what if a retard assigns my sold call at 23$. I only have a cash account on tastyworks. Would they close the trade immediately or am I fucked in this (not very likely) outcome?

Lay on your back, stare at the ceiling as long as you can without blinking. When you blink, close your eyes for a few seconds then do it one more time. Can't find the source rn on why it works but it can help. Personally I prefer weed tho
im fukin tired of mitch
that's a really inefficient way to go about it
Yeah just on the clean energy side even if both D win I can't see a massive overhaul. Biden didn't seem very aoc on the green new deal.

That's not to say there won't be more cash there. I think they reinstate ev credits through a new bill and probably subsidize solar if both D win.
I can see you definitely don’t watch the pac-12 lol.

Blame inflation for that. If the government spending wasn't [going parabolic](https://www.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/budget-ceiling.png) you might be able to do cool things on 50k too. Of course under those circumstances your salary would also be significantly less, so...

1. In his letter, he attributes the run in stock price to his 13D filing. All I'm saying is: why increase the price before buying it. That seems to be to his disadvantage. 

2. Are you saying GameStop will make their own video games? 
I disagree that MSFT/Nintendo/Sony don't have a lot of b2c sales:
Here is the PS4 full game software digital download ratio (which can be found in the Sony Supplemental for their earnings releases):  
2015: 19%  
2016: 27%  
2017: 32%  
2018: 43%  
2019: 55%  
2020: 66%  

3. That's fair, but it just seems to be counterintuitive to me that they can compete with b2c from Sony/Nintendo/MSFT. A GME game studio would be interesting, except MSFT is buying them all and GME can't afford them.
You say that like it's trivial. Good business people are as rare as good engineers.

I kind of feel the opposite. The contracts they've been announcing have been on the small end, and there's not much to indicate 4th quarter numbers will be anything spectacular. With those lockups looming right after earnings I don't see a lot of interested buyers outside the WSB memes. I just read 80% of shares will be available after the lock up. And those people who bought during the IPO will likely be able to sell for significant gains.

But I'm still a newbie with this shit and mostly a dumbass so I'm probably wrong. Im expecting to buy back in at $15-18 in late February.

Wouldn’t do weeklies, give it a few months. Same thing happened end of oct, stock went back down to 259 the rose to 300 the following month. They just won a huge deal with Walmart to handle all of their returns. Upcoming quarter results will include Black Friday and cyber Monday. This year holiday shipping season is extended from Jan 1 to Jan 19. Let’s all not forget all of the revenue from vaccine shipping. This next quarter results will be their best ever and yet estimates are only 3.33 and they did 4.87 last quarter when this one will be better. 

All while trading half of the forward PE of the sp500. Heavily overweight June 300c and 320c. With volume very low, stock can be manipulated so I would not do weeklies and give it some time

It’ll certainly depend on what kind of announcement they make. Apple has seen similar sell offs after their event.
I like your investment strategy here but 100% may prove a difficult target to hit. I'm PLTR gang myself but I think it certainly has the possibility of you getting assigned those shares and the stock being bearish over the next 6 months, not allowing you to make those sweet gains from selling puts and covered calls as the price slowly goes up. And if you're making money on covered calls during that time when it would be hypothetically bearish, the stock could abruptly moon and you could potentially even lose money from your initial investment. Good luck to you!

is your 401k contribution still working?

I literally wondered for like 4 pay cycles why I was making a bunch more until I saw my 401k contributions were turned off somehow.
Got up 250%, lost about 15% of that trying to play the post crash market and closed out everything. Ended the year up 200% with just a couple of trades since July.
It sounds corny but it’s a habit, once you get used to it, you adjust.  My problem was that I think I’m a big shot because I do a couple of trades and I make money, but I become humble by losing. And when you are just making it by in life, you need a few burns in the market to initiate yourself.  Doing DD and trade accordingly.   I been there where i invest in a sure fire trade, and it drops the hour I buy it.   I’m tempered now, I buy, I hold, I check it once every 2 weeks.  I keep other things in mind.  Hard asset investments and other forms of passive income, this way, any loss in the market is not life changing, it would just be the way things go sometimes.  Lick wounds, move on, try to help others if it comes natural.  Happy new year

1) who says he hasn’t? And who says that it won’t be announced shortly?
2) yeah that’s not right at all. Amazon has Amazon basics and other private label products that compete with their sellers. Same with wayfair. It’s about brand equity and whether you’re seen as a destination. Microsoft and Nintendo and Sony don’t do a lot of b2c sales, why do you think Walmart and Best Buy exist?
3) go where the puck is going, not where the puck is. If $gme can get to netflix status by taking a fee on every transaction, we’ll be on the right path. A game studio as $gme 2.0 isn’t crazy either.

ROFL, PLTR really brings out the best in WSB.
That is still much better imo then being smart enough to realize you were dumb to begin with and not really risking it out there. You can't learn the mistake or realize the gains unless you throw your balls around a little.

If you don’t need to sleep, caffeine will generally fix it. But otherwise what people already said, Benadryl, a sleep aid, water, aspirin, melatonin.

1. That’s fair, but it still seems he could have gotten a better price by approaching management 

2. Right, but those middle men don’t compete with a direct to consumer model from the console makers. 

3. Netflix is no longer a digital middle man, they spend as much on content as Disney. It might even be slightly more now.

The connection to Prinz actually made me doubt the viability of this company. As someone in academics myself, I know that labs doing work that is 'potentially world changing' are a dime a dozen. In most cases there is a catch of some sort which makes the work completely inapplicable in the real world (in hardware, due to the costs being prohibitive, in biology, due to adverse effects beyond the narrow thing being studied). People don't worry about it too much, the PIs get a grant and a Nature paper, the media writes a puff piece, and life moves on. If there is money to be made, usually a real player hires the graduate students/postdocs, brings the PI on as a consultant, and develops the product. It must not have been viable if they needed to spin out a company on their own.
Google is your friend :)

First of all, I have made $10m plus in my career. Second of all, my father in law spent $250k on our apartment, I got $590k when my mom died and my dad recently asked me to invest $1m of his capital.

Bought my Samsung 70 smart tv for $450 back in March. Give it a few months and they’ll drop the price some more.
You are forgetting one of the most important parts to this trade is the ASR. Advanced Share Repurchase that’s supposed to be done by the end of February for buying back shares. So the float is 118m shares, over 70m are short and over 15m shares are being bought back. There just aren’t many shares to be bough, if demand for them rises this will skyrocket. Forget Wendy’s tendies when you can buy the entire Wendy’s.

I'm simply pointing out the stories about those "concentration camps" don't make sense, and the so called "evidence" don't add up - unless the Chinese government is run by bunch of irrational lunatics, who just make impulsive decisions with no plan, tactics or strategy. And that is hard to believe for the world's second largest economy which is competing with US in economy, technology, and military.

It's funny you mentioned that statements of fact must be reviewed to determine their validity. I wonder what kind of review or validity process you went through, which easily brought you to believe everything they say. Since again and again you fail to provide any insights to why you believe in what you believe, I can only come to the conclusion that you probably just read some sensational titles and took that as a fact, which I don't know if I should describe as ignorance or stupidity, or maybe both.
If day trading was your primary occupation taking over 25% of your time, then you can legally claim all the losses. You will not be limited to $3k in such situations.

Big short or Wolf of Wallstreet ? what’s your favorite?
Everyone was wondering when they would be able to buy in after it went above $20, worried they wouldn’t get the chance. Well the answer is NOW. I sold to lock in some modest gains at around $20.50 like a paper handed fool. Didn’t want to FOMO chase it but held on hoping for a small dip below what I sold for after that resistance at $21. Though I got lucky at $18.87, I realized there is no sense trying to time a drop of a couple dollars and miss out on the upside of what should be at least $30 minimum in the short term -  possibly double or triple that over the next few months. Went all in yesterday and bought $5k worth of shares, have another $2k deposited into my account waiting to clear that I am going to put in as well. Any news of additional purchases by RC will likely get it past the last resistance level either way, and may trigger the short squeeze we’ve all been anticipating. After that brief lapse in reason I remembered that I am not here for modest gains. Going to try to get my principle investment up to $10k over the next week or two and then buckle in for the ride to the top. Got in to PLTR at $24 so when it goes above that I will be using those proceeds towards GME as well to maybe exceed $10K if that happens before news of additional buy in’s by RC. Not nearly as much $ in it as a lot of you guys on here but, trying to do my part to reduce the amount of shares available to short sellers. 

If you get asked by your brokerage if they can lend out your shares for whatever percentage they are offering, don’t let them! If a short squeeze happens after RC makes any filings it should really start to ride, especially if in doing so it causes another 25-30% jump in the price. Now that it’s Jan 1 we also don’t have to worry about it happening to take losses for tax purposes, things are looking good.
In at $13. I’ve made about $50k on it this year from the stock plus selling covered calls and csp’s.

You could research it yourself but you won’t. You’ll keep wasting money buying meme shit you read about on here that you don’t understand. Enjoy staying poor you chode.
Me also, in at $15.60 and thinking of selling everything I own for more
How??

Well boys, that had to be the top for GME. Retards out here throwing 2.5mill on it.
Clever and gay.
It was meant to be.
it might mean it's a top 5 WSB holding
Indeed. Let's see how it plays out. 

If the situation is resolved and no delisting then there's the rally to $40. If indeed gets delisted, down potential is around 20% as it will still trade OTC until November and still listed in HK
New Year’s resolutions are like guidelines, it can still be a resolution to quit or even just reduce it greatly, even if you’re smoking right now.

Does the subway rumor actually have any substance? If we're talking private food establishments, I would think a private regional grocery chain would be more in line with their vision.

With WB investing in Kroger and the possibility of them going to more robotic warehousing, AliBabas announcement they were investing more heavily in JIT production, I could see the desire to get in on the next wave of online ordering... 

For instance, Publix in the Southeast invested heavily on in-house JIT forecasting and production management software. They've recently crossed into a grey area of their longstanding tradition of not having a "members card" in order to access their sale prices. 

They've added a mobile app card that you can pay with by entering your phone number. Fucking brilliant. Imagine how much data they are able to gather about their customers shopping habits.

That's why I think PSTH will purchase minority stakes in both Publix Supermarkets and PLTR in order to directly compete with Amazon in the fresh grocery delivery market.

people are clearly very interested in PLTR and i don't think that's going away anytime soon.  i was actually planning to buy a shitton of $20 LEAPS for Jan 2023 but WSB got there first and i wasn't going to buy at $28~.  i changed plans once the options got so expensive.

It’s actually evolved - unless you are that out of touch with this sub.
So why not just do a 1 year leap and roll it into another 1 year leap at the end? If you expect consistent returns you get more upside exposure that way and still get long term tax
I can tell you have potential

I think you're getting SpaceX and Tesla mixed up. SMT has 10% of their portfolio as Tesla, SpaceX isn't a publicly traded company. The only way you can invest in it is either through a company's mutual fund like Fidelity, being an "Accredited Investor", or indirectly by owning shares of a company like Alphabet, which put in over a billion dollars into SpaceX when it launched.
Hmmm disagree on hottest bond girl
Also, I didn’t wanna call you “clueless” cuz I don’t object to personal attacks, but I love how clueless you are not being able to read between the lines and me implying, no, I’m not at the loss but even at the worst case scenario, it’s not that big of a loss.
Yep! One of the safest SPACs in the world. As soon as PSTH dips below 26.50, I will buy more shares haha 🚀😎

I remember when I lost my ass on hylion because I believed in the company and it’s product so much. Now it’s trading in the fucking mud. Might be a ton of bag holders on this sub soon :/

Using your marginable stock portfolio as a line of credit is a big dick move.  Opens up lots of opportunities when you get to higher levels.  e.g. buying properties w cash to close fast and beat competing offers then financing later.
[deleted]
Been there done that
Possibly, but the higher a stock goes on hype for the future the more precarious the position becomes. TSLA has zero margin for error at this point because retail has already pulled forward gains as if the rosiest of outcomes is a guarantee. 

So yea, it could work out, but is it likely? The bulls trade TSLA like everything musk says is a certainty, when for those paying attention would realize Elon will say absolutely anything to drum up a mania which has led him to gain 100 billion dollars this year.
Who are the Tutes? Oh institutional? LOL. My god. If you believe them, please go and short TSLA

“Every generation blames the one before”. 

That statement is soo popular it’s a song lyric. I think it’s called Living Years.
Well lets see.....they sell your order flow to the dark pools so HFTs can front run you.....they fill orders in the dark pools at prices that never actually hit in the actual order book.....they auto sell your positions on expiration day in a way that is consistently disadvantageous to you.... they unwind spreads at expiration in way that is consistently disadvantageous to you (sometimes disastrously so)......and they have cool little emojs and cute messages and a pretty user interface.

I hope you're joking but in case you're not: Google covered calls

Go to your broker, go to options, select 8 januari 2021, select 22, 23, 24, 25 whatever, sell a couple hundred of each. If GME doesn't end up being above that price (strike price) before january 8th, you get to keep your shares and the extra money. If it ends up being above the strike price, your shares are called away (for that price (so you make strike price + whatever they paid extra (premium)).

Rinse and repeat. 

Only thing is! If it goes up to 80, you don't get that extra cash. But as long as it doesn't squeeze you are just making about 20K-30K a week (if this works for a month and you've made 100K, you can buy my most expensive typewriter for 12K as a thank you)

Very interesting trade, though. I'm surprised that you work in e-commerce and you believe in Gamestop's e-commerce considering their competition. I'm interested to see your analysis. I can't tell if it's a true fundamental analysis, or you're just hoping the price spikes on a Cohen takeover.

What if TSLA buys GME and converts them to Tesla dealerships? And then TSLA buys PLTR and refurbs it into a satellite data harvesting company and merges it with SpaceX? And then he buys MT to make rockets and folds all these companies under SpaceX and then does a SPAC based direct IPO?

Printing that much money will hurt the dollar and push even more people into equities considering their money is losing value just sitting there and more and more people are realizing it.

Remember, I'm not saying it should go up or not, just that it can get way worse than this. RN, it'd only take aobut 5 years for the company to catch up to the valuations and analyst expectations are still very conservative. Extremely conservative. Most hedge funds haven't really gotten into it yet and now that it's added to the SP 500, they will kind of have to. But, that's just my opinion, it could be wrong. If it does run up to 5k in 2022, then perhaps you have a point in shorting it.

I'm confused about 0:32   
What lessons did we learn?
I believe in taking care of myself, and a balanced diet and a rigorous exercise routine. In the morning, if my face is a little puffy, I’ll put on an ice pack while doing my stomach crunches. I can do a thousand now. After I remove the ice pack I use a deep pore cleanser lotion. In the shower I use a water activated gel cleanser, then a honey almond body scrub, and on the face an exfoliating gel scrub. Then I apply an herb-mint facial masque which I leave on for 10 minutes while I prepare the rest of my routine. I always use an after shave lotion with little or no alcohol, because alcohol dries your face out and makes you look older. Then moisturizer, then an anti-aging eye balm followed by a final moisturizing protective lotion. There is an idea of a Patrick Bateman. Some kind of abstraction. But there is no real me. Only an entity. Something illusory. And though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there.

Softbank still has a stake though, Hydunai just has the reigns because they own more controlling shares as I understand it.
The process is much more streamlined underwater, it’s easier to get the wicker through your ass
I think it has more to do with DASH having positive cash flows that makes valuating the company more viable than PLTR, which has shown  consistent negative FCF. From what I've seen, many analysts are cautious until they are positive, or can show they're positive. There's a lot of eyes on their Feb 11th ER.
Car charges like bull. Very bullish.
Lets be real, there will be a rise up followed by a sharp sell off in the short term. If you play for the long run on NIO, it shouldn't concern you really but I'd still keep an eye out if they say anything stupid. If you are a short term investor, I'd sell a few days before NIO day. Also, if you are short term investor, there might be a dip following NIO day as short term investors cash out. I'd buy here. The recovery should take a few days.

I know it’s not true TA but I see it coming down to about $18 this following week (below when earnings hit , but just a bit)

If there wasn’t catalyst to bring it up a significant amount by end of January I’d say it could fall back to $15, but I don’t see it happening with current events https://i.imgur.com/PI9mYYr.jpg

I grabbed 4000 shares at ~$26.50 into PSTH after researching it for a couple hours but I didn't think it was anything big considering the $20 floor.

So..... Couple things..

1) Get job, bang gf, spend money on GME, keep learning stonks.
2) Cheating is often a symptom of poor COMMUNICATION which you don't do gud, u autistic bear fucker. Instead, maintain regular communication, both formalized and spontaneous, using that to better weigh other metrics, such as physical and emotional intimacy. Bang gf, gfs bf, gfs bff, and bnsf. You. Dawg.
3) ???
4) Get rich, graph her responsiveness to your unexpected financial salience, recognizing an artificial bull market. Take initiative of the pump and dump setup, bang gf, dump gf, and finally go poly because when your needs aren't restricted by unspoken and television-based social etiquettes, open communication becomes an activity and not a chore :)

Profit from everything. Don't want a job? Get it to fund your tendie factory. Being cheated on emotionally? Grow the fuck up and talk about your feelings, and lose that little girl if she can't nut up and talk to you like a grown-ass woman! And don't forget: BRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRR
You literally deserve to lose all your money, using daddies money to buy a stupid meme stock

My counter argument to that is that people were gay bears and saying that the vaccine isn't going to make PFE and MRNA that much money in the long run. I honestly think PFE is going to recover back to the low 40s during earnings around mid January as the vaccine is going to boost its earnings alongside its other successful products like Viagra. Lots of normie boomers having sex during quarantine lets be real. Comparing buying a car with continuous purchases on charging to buying a vaccine you take twice and nevermore is like comparing apples to oranges.

My dude, don’t hate on other people’s gains however they won.
We all think sometimes.. I am just watching this it's no big deal, it's not hurting anyone. Think again !!

The whole family suffers because of your sins. You do something which displeases Allah , you think you will have the Rahmah and barakah at your house? Angles visit your house everyday to record this sin of your's ..dont you feel ashamed. By watching this filth you are being selfish, it may have an immediate problem in your life but over the years it does effect you.

Example A person is a drug addict once his family comes to know about it , his family will ashamed , depressed , sad and it will effect everyone. Same with this flithy habit , think about your future , your future wife.

Your sin will be affecting two family and society in general. Your wife is your second half you share your problems , your thoughts with her but don't make her share the burden of this with you.

Mufti menk once said in his lecture every droplet of sin has an affect on us. Every sin we do we have to pay for it in our life /hereafter.

Please don't fall again into sin.

My family all thinks I got fired cuz they always ask how work is and I keep telling them I don’t do anything

I’m in a similar boat and just did this in Etrade.  I think you can do this at level 1 so nothing to change with your account.  Go to Trade > Options put in your ticker and change Buy Open to Sell Open.  Choose your strike price (the price you’d be willing to sell your shares for and the price the options buyer can exercise their options and buy your shares).  I’m assuming you want to sell weekly expiration at a higher strike price so as not to sell your shares too cheap and still make a little money off the options.  You could only sell 30 options since you own 3000 shares.  Options are in increments of 100 blocks of shares.  

Look into options to better understand, but that’s the basics.  You can change your expiration date, strike price, and go with market prices or set a limit to sell the options.

Your problem is you buy and sell too early.  We are all buying and holding til the end of time or the short squeeze.  The ups and downs dont even matter.   To the true diamond hands - down  99% dont matter if it means 3000% gains.  Stocks never expire so why sell.   You want the squeeze, buy and wait until april.
it wouldn't be a weekend thread without an escort update.

The 5.5c had a breakeven of 2% at 2x leverage.
Not familiar with that SPAC. Isn’t AIG an insurance company?
So let’s say you sell a 103c against your 93c. You have an 8.10 debit from the 93c and the 103c would get you a 4.55 credit. Your risk max risk goes from $810 loss to a $355 loss (8.10 - 4.55). Your max profit is ($10 x 100) - $355 per contract which is $645. So your potential upside is now 180% gain and your breakeven went from 101.10 to 96.55. Without the spread, the price has to hit 107.55 before you would make 6.45 but that gain is only a 79% gain because you had to risk $810 to make the $645.

oh, you can give yourself a 5 to 10 years horizon. IDGAF. You think it's a FOMO and crappy company just like the other guy and think that's it's going to 0 and will be bought out by other auto manufacturers. Surely if it's that much of a bubble it's worth it to short it. Those are his own words and you called me a "fucking moron".  You should back it up.

personally, I do think it's overpriced, but it's hasn't gotten nearly to peak FOMO yet. I think FOMO can get 5x worse, but it's just my opinion. But I would never short it because it will catch up to its valuations and faster than you'd think. RN, it really wouldn't take long before that happens. The underlying company after is a great company and that's gonna stay.
Retard with 1.1k shares at 27 usd avg checking in. Bought into the hype just to be a bag holder for people who have 13 yrs of shares looking to dump once lock up expires.  Oh well. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌛 - Enough rockets and stock goes up. Trust.
There's no fucking way it goes up more than a few points until the lockups expire. Maybe they'll announce some huge billion dollar contracts but that's not very likely.


It'll do great long term I think but not until those lockups expire and people who've been holding for a decade finally get to cash out.
They havent announced yet but once we know IV gonna moon until sales come out, hang on as close to the last minute as u have guts for IMO

On average, the market goes up every night.

So, every day, while the market is closed, pick ****ONE**** stock to buy and hold for the day.

Sell your overnight every morning, buy your daily.

Set an alarm to sell your daily 30 minutes before close and re-buy your standard overnight.

How to pick your overnight and your daily are the next tricks.

Good question. So another thing I noticed my dentist doing that I asked about.. which now feels like it should be a logical thought process... anyways. Those pick imo are nice for on the go, but shouldn’t be a substitute for regular flossing with string floss.

The issue is that when flossing, say you haven’t flossed in awhile or you are removing food particles, it becomes contaminated with plaque. You should be rotating the floss section by section for each new tooth. For obvious reasons you can’t achieve this with a pick.

For a 1/2in section of floss I go and shape the floss around like a C. I think about the tooth I’m working on; not the gap in each tooth. So I will be flossing the front side of one tooth and bringing the plaque out from the gum lines, I then switch to the front tooth to the back side of the next tooth.

I work to bring the plaque up into the crevice between each tooth and then I’ll try and flick it up and out in one go. I’ll usually have either the water running or a tissue and wipe the floss off and then keep flicking plaque out until I’m satisfied.

I’ll rotate the floss on my fingers to a new unused section of floss and move on to the next area.

When using waxed floss such as glide, I can usually see when the floss gets darker it’s time to move to a new part of the string.

I think you're right but I'm worried about losing my shirt at the moment. It seems to drop every day. It's hard to keep faith because I don't know a whole lot about PLTR. I have heard criticisms that 1. they have a small customer base (which if the US Gov is one of their customers, it kind of doesn't matter) and 2. some people are suggesting PLTR will get bought out early on by a Google or something.

I'm with you. I've been selling short call spreads since options became available. I think I'm gonna buy more puts in Feb to play the lockup crash. My other puts have fucked me so far since it love to pump it back up to certain price.
Can we talk about this ABB.  They’ve got EV stuff.  Busses...uh...yeah, busses, on the road somewhere, maybe Sweden 🇸🇪 and uh...like charging stations for d’s busses.  It’s really cool guys!  Wow!  And uh...oh yah they make these EV motors that can power like uh induscrumental masheenery like bulldozers or something.  Maybe dump trucks too.  Wow!  What else... solar 🤩 They got these good pictures of solar panels on the web, and these European dudes in hard hats are in the pics and clipboards too I think.  Anyway, the company is called ABB and I really want it to moon by January 15 but if it doesn’t that’s ok too because I don’t have emuff exposhur and it’s poised for a breakout but I’m 🐔💩
So are you denying the existence of concentration camps in Xinjiang? Or trying to justify it by saying other groups are not put in concentration camps? You aren't really putting forward any cohesive argument or rationale. 

>That's similar to someone who suddenly decides "oh let's slaughter everyone who has a mole under their left eye and go to Starbucks on Monday" - does that make sense to you?

No, I am not arguing the validity of genocide for any categories of people. Doing it because of race or because of moles is equally reprehensible.

>Or you just eat whatever shit they feed you from FoxNews or CNN or whatever news outlet there?

Feel free to share a claim by one of these outlets and refute it if you feel China is not being fairly represented. Statements of fact must be reviewed individually to determine their validity, just because these networks are often wrong does not mean everything they say is wrong.

Where in that source does it say EU spends more on Healthcare then US?

U.S. healthcare costs exceed those of other countries, relative to the size of the economy or GDP.

The U.S. spends more as a percentage of GDP than similar countries, and this can be explained either through higher prices for services themselves, higher costs to administer the system, or more utilization of these services, or to a combination of these elements

I could have afforded a CLS 63 but I am pretty frugal and I decided to throw down on a partial stake in a Dialysis center. Already netting me 2k a month on a 50k investment, and because the location is good I should be able to net an extra 25k a year for the next 15+ years.
Reach is fucking awful. Glide is wax coated where as reach is not, plus reach is more likely to break when flossing which makes the whole task 10x more frustrating.

You could actually pull them out and compare them. Glide is visual bigger in width and when it’s properly on your tooth it’s much better as it cuts more off the surface.

Interesting. Thoughts on those plastic pic things with the small bit of floss? Is that just removing plaque from one tooth and placing in the next?

No one plays options long term.... I think you mean to be in /r/investing
Yeah, it's true, we guys all aim to to be absolutely filthy....filthy rich that is...to get option 1 ;D
I like this theory from u/redcedar53 -

I think that 3% (buy on to 9.8% ownership) was just to test the waters to see how the market would react. It jumping to 25% upon news and holding it there for 2 weeks, that’s good enough data points. It also suggests there is a lot of cash waiting on the sidelines ready to jump in GME. My guess would be the next buy in could be double last week’s (7%) upping his totally ownership to 20%.

This is just such a perfect timing technically (cup and handle forming since Dec. 1), sales numbers coming up (I suspect it’ll come next week), and then the conference. 

They also probably don’t want each news to overshadow each other - they would want to jump off each other to build the momentum. I suspect 13D filing early next week to jump start the momentum, sales numbers mid-late next week to sustain the momentum, and the the conference the week after that for a complete explosion.

what about a E63 Wagon.
That you only pay at most 33% in income (marginal rates not the effective tax rate). So  if you would have not lost your 3K you could’ve had at worst case scenario, 2K extra (this is assuming the 10K in your scenario was earned in the same year). If you lost your 3k the deduction could be in the best of cases 1k. Since 2>1 then you’re better off not losing the money

When you "write it off on taxes" you don't deduct the amount of the loss from taxes owed, you deduct it from taxable income. The tax savings = losses x tax rate.

Copied myself from above for you. I started taking dental health seriously and actually paid attention to my dentist and their codes for each tooth so when I’m having issues I can actually tell them in specific what is wrong


Alright not to go super hard on dental bullshit but, could be the floss you are using. Glide is the only way. Picks and whatnot are not a substitute. Don’t be cheap either it’s like $3 for 3 yards and should last a long time.

You could just be going to hard as well. I stand in the mirror and gently slide the floss in between each tooth and get down in the gum pockets, try to make a C shape around your tooth, slide out and up with floss. There’s a lot of plaque that could get stuck there that you are missing and this will cause you to continually bleed.

Go to the dentist and when they read your pocket depths ask for a print out with the numbers. Anything 4+ is a major attention area.
 My car isn’t turning on and when I try to it sounds like rocks are in the engine . Should I go invest in $ROPE? Or should I try to fight the rest of 2021
Agreed. Now while there’s less GME this weekend will look into MrChewy when Cohen took over and see how he approached the business then. I’m still trying to understand why the recent 13d filing was done by Chris Nebel instead of Chris Davis. Looks like Nebel has been successful with his clients taking on winning board representation in the last 3 months himself.
I'd like to see a steady tick down for a change. But I think it will look more like March when it happens. Too bad really.
BTFD!

Alright not to go super hard on dental bullshit but, could be the floss you are using. Glide is the only way. Picks and whatnot are not a substitute. Don’t be cheap either it’s like $3 for 3 yards and should last a long time.

You could just be going to hard as well. I stand in the mirror and gently slide the floss in between each tooth and get down in the gum pockets, try to make a C shape around your tooth, slide out and up with floss. There’s a lot of plaque that could get stuck there that you are missing and this will cause you to continually bleed.

Go to the dentist and when they read your pocket depths ask for a print out with the numbers. Anything 4+ is a major attention area.

If it wasn't for the libertarian 🤡 party spoiling the vote (only thing they ever achieve anyway), gop would've won. So I'd say they're at an advantage. Of course the situation is different now so no guarantees but I'm guessing gop will win. Their voters are also more likely to show up for elections on dates that don't align with presidential ones, which is now the case.

Okay this might be really stupid but I don’t understand how tax deductions from losses aren’t free money. Let’s say I have a $10,000 portfolio. I put $7,000 into stocks I plan on holding longer than a year. The other $3,000 I use to YOLO. Best case scenario the YOLO hits and I’ve made a bunch of tendies, worst case scenario I lose it all and I get to write it off on taxes, therefore neutralizing the loss. What am I missing?

Yeah, another guy mentioned Chairman and that makes way more sense. You also don’t want to display divided GME (with shorts roaming about), you want to project unity and strength. Best case scenario is Sherman keeps his job and Cohen gets elected as the Chairman.

Probably like a mil
Noob question: have we entered an age where we no longer have prolonged bear markets? Meaning, say Fed announces Monday they are going to increase interest rates steadily in the next 2 months. The reaction would be of an over exaggerated sell off, like perhaps it happened in March and then we have another V shaped recovery to catch up to sane valuations - all of it happening within months, rather than years. I feel this could be possible because of more participation in the stock market today, as compared to the past. 

Or am I just hypothesing something which is no way possible to confirm or deny.
You know Warren Buffet started working when he was 12?

It would be kinda cool if there was a sub thread for some of the meme stocks or if we could flair by ticker so I could easily look at a discussion on the shit im in. Or if someone can just tell me exactly what is going to happen to ICLN every day for the next month that would be cool too.

Hi retards, it's me again with another chart. Some of you would've noticed the big AH volume on NYE. The more sensible ones have said this volume was because of 'options settlement'. But since when did we let sense get in the way of confirmation bias?

A slightly different take on this...

Actually, this person may be a truly enlightened, cunning Autist.

See, if they divorced in a state which allows for spousal support, the OP may be getting a decent percentage of the Chemical Engineer's salary.

Let's play - Chemical Engineer for $100k per year.  Divorce, and because of spousal support in the state where they got divorced, OP is entitled to half; $50k a year until age 60.

So, $70k a year ($50k plus $20k a year in trading money, if OP never does any better than how they've been doing, trading-wise) until 60 for being able to fuck Chemical Engineer when CE was in the prime years of CE's life.

AND, OP not having to work at a McJob to get it.

I dont know, they're jehovas witness.  They don't use tech like condoms, but do drive cars.   Not sure where the line is.
Yea, it might sound counter-intuitive but your diet doesn’t have to be completely clean. Make sure you get in enough protein (about 1g/lb), a little bit of healthy fat (avocados, nuts, etc.), and a bit of veggies and fruits. After you’ve done that you can just add on some carb heavy foods like you like eating. Just don’t go too crazy and gain a ton of weight quickly, this isn’t productive for muscle gain. It’s very difficult to gain weight just eating chicken and rice.

I think a safe way to realize that what you are doing is mad risky is the fact that you bought **95 contracts** in a small account. I am also bullish on NIO for the next month, but you should've bought say 50c or 55c but instead by 3-10 contracts, or however much you can afford.

A gay bull — one any father could be proud of!
Another way to "not miss out on bull runs" when selling puts and covered calls is to use some of the premium collected to buy OTM calls, creating a synthetic long position (kinda) with the put and creating a call credit spread with the covered call.  
But yes, buying calls would deviate from the original aim of the"Buy and Hold Redux" strategy.
I support this. Real talk, if you haven’t flossed in a long time you will bleed. Could be bad technique too. Stick with it and your gums will get healthier and stop bleeding in about a week or two. Also mouth wash... it really helps.

Youtube options for beginners, there are thousands of helpful videos and resources available.  Be sure to form at least a basic understanding before jumping in with real money, and when you do jump in, start with small option plays.  When they say GME to the moon, they are speculating that the share value of GME will be moving up quickly in a short amount of time.  If you want to join in, you would either: buy calls, sell puts, or buy shares (less risk).   Be warned, calls, puts and all other option plays can and do expire worthless.  Shares may decrease in value, but other than the company getting delisted it's improbable that you would lose all of your initial investment.  Of course the downside is, you won't have as much upside.  Even the best traders lose, but they are smart enough to not have bet everything on it.  Size your positions so that you can lose, and live to trade again.  Hope that helps.  Happy New Year!

I suggest strongly you check out YouTube for many videos on what a covered call is, why sell them and step by step instructions (at various broker sights like Robinhood and Webull mostly).

This video my adult daughter sent me to illustrate the concept. I found it immensely helpful.

my robinhood all time chart is funny. steady small gains as i first just used it to buy stocks and bought a heap of apple and exxon mainly -> pretty big crash when oil dumped a couple of years ago or so -> steady gains again -> rocket upwards as i discovered options -> drastic falling off a cliff after i held TSLA calls through the cybertruck reveal -> steady gains after that -> drilling to earth's core in march with the market crash made worse when i tried to win some options plays in march resulting in a margin call -> a couple of huge spikes since then followed by more cliff jumps as i made some option plays that were really good, but got greedy and just held the bag instead. all in all like an 80% loss and my account is at a deficit lol
Oh yes because riding from 14 to 21 really fucked be over.

I have a fucking serious question. I just saw that there used to be a company in Germany called Wildcard, whose business mode looks very similar to Paysafe (or BFT). Wildcard turned out to be a scam BUT it grew 10x in the first few years (from 15 to 150 europoor dollars). So if BFT is a legit company does this mean it can easily hit over 150 in next few years??

The comparison is Autist vs Passive investor. One is high risk/high reward, the other is relatively low risk/low reward.

I made fun of myself by saying I got the worst of both worlds -  return of Passive Investor, but the risk of the autist. That's the entire point of the comment, that was the point. I never said "Passive Investor with added risk" - that's a pointless comparison to make. Nobody was talking about QQQ, thats why the other guy said something like “QQQ is not an investment a safe index fund person would make”
thats Universal not Disney. Im guessing Florida so no surprise there.

Besides letting nearly everyone trade options and letting you trade fractional shares on just about everything, what else does Robinhood do differently than other brokerages?
Nope it's a sports betting app. I can give you a access code for the app and we both get a free 100 bucks to start. But it's just doing multileg bets ... and each bet has a 50/50 chance . So like this next bet I'm doing is 50 cents but if each team I picked win I make 75,000 cash . The teams I picked are... one sec..
Did you do any actual DD besides see Ryan Cohan likes it? What is the argument that this company actually turns around?

I’m probably going to write up a DD on it this weekend for the sub, but basically for several separate independent reasons I believe Apple is headed into a monster ER, which is expected some time at the end of Jan. I believe Apple is headed for record sales on nearly every product, they’ll be able to post their first reoccurring revenue bundle (subscription) numbers, app sales are being reported to have grown twice as fast in December of this year as they did last year. There was a COVID delay that pushed the new iPhone launch day into this quarter when it normally begins in the prior quarter, etc etc. Twitter rumor mill is reporting supply chain moving at record pace. I’m super aggressive in apple currently . 20% of my net worth is in Apple LEAPS and another 15% is in OTM Jan 29 and Feb 19 calls.
It’s Friday ... YES

Normally you will get margin called before you owe anything to the broker and they will liquidate positions if you don’t deposit more funds

Only time you end up owing them money would be if the underlying moves really quickly (like a giant move overnight that causes you to lose more than 50%)

In that case they will liquidate positions  and you could end up owing them money

Here you go: buy a REGN 1/15 $470 call on monday for $20 when the stock dips around 1-2 hours after open. Then sell a 1/15 $480 call for $15 when it starts going up after a couple hours. Double your money in 2 weeks and all the stock has to do is stay flat or go higher over that time.

Federal eviction moratorium ended yesterday. I wonder how this is all gonna play out in the next 6-12 months. 

I’m selling my house and moving this summer so I’m a little worried about what will happen.
That's me. I have no choice but to go full retard in this shit. One broken hip and im living in a box.
Will try it. Thanks!
You clearly don't believe that... where are the rocket emojis???
That's kind of crazy. I don't see how in ten years time they're not just a shell of their former selves, especially with digital game purchases increasing year by year drastically and the new consoles releasing digital only variants. The used game market was their bread and butter and that's going away.
Bill is literally looking for a company to roll into his PSH fund. He is in this for the long hall.

Clarman and friends are likely in a similar boat.
How about bear calendar spreads? Sell short dated puts until the lock up expires, buy a long dated put for after.
Awesome. Thanks for sharing!

Yes, sorry I should’ve elaborated in my statement. I agree with you.
That is the way.

Yea this is a good point. Do not continue taking it if you are experiencing adverse effects. Personally, I have a high tolerance for stimulants, but it’s not for everyone

I would say that's a combo of hindsight and risk management though. people constantly say "should've kept my money in" or "should've cut losses sooner" it's always the same shit because people trade with their emotions not their brain

Nah the Brexit was a year ago with a one year grace period. Plus I would think the sterling would lose some value (no imports through the UK to get it into Europe), but why did the dollar appreciate so much. Could be low liquidity as well.

How so? I was worried that all the upward movement was potentially done
As an intel analyst who has used Palantir on multiple deployments, I'm watching it closely, but too afraid to YOLO it because of the contract wars.
Whenever you hear someone say "Buy and hold" what they actually mean is:

* Buy and hold
* Diversify
* Rebalance from time to time.

No one thinks that you should buy and hold one thing forever because that one thing might go bankrupt and you might be missing out on something else which is sky rocketing. What they mean by "buy and hold" is don't fucking sell because of short term dips. If you time them wrong it can be disaaaaastrous cause not only do you sell for a loss of whatever% but if you don't get back in before things come back up you could miss out on huge gains on the up swing. 

From this article: https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/31/missing-just-a-few-of-the-best-stock-market-days-c/

>How much exactly? 
JPMorgan's asset management arm has put an exact price to these missed days in its Guide to Retirement report. If you invested $10,000 into the S&P 500 on Jan. 3, 2000 and left it completely invested until Dec. 31, 2019, you would've received an average annual return of just over 6%. Your $10,000 would've grown to $32,421.

>This 20-year period of time includes roughly 5,000 days during which the stock market was open. But as the table below shows, if you missed just the 10 best days out of those 5,000, you'd have less than half as much money. Miss the best 20 days, and you'd barely have made any money at all over 20 years, and you'd have lost money if you missed more winning days.

Time Invested Since Jan. 3, 2000	
Dollar Value 	Annualized Performance

* Fully invested into S&P 500	$32,421	6.06%

* Missed 10 best days 
$16,180	2.44%

* Missed 20 best days
$10,176	0.08%

* Missed 30 best days 
$6,749	(1.95%)

* Missed 40 best days 
$4,607	(3.8%)

* Missed 50 best days
$3,246	(5.47%)

* Missed 60 best days
$2,331	(7.02%)

Now imagine you bought 2000 shares. Tendies. Now imagine you bought 2000 calls, millionaire driving a Tesla finally getting your wife back from her boyfriend. 

You fucked up bro.
Just buy more to average down 🙃
do you apprentice ship and then start a business, you can learn everything from industry forums.  Thats what I did.  I don't even have a trade, just landscaping.  You could easily make 100k plus just as a sole prop by yourself, 200k plus if you get a handful of employees eventually.  It takes my wife, myself and 2 employees for us to net 100k, plus all our vehicles, insurance, fuel, phone, internet, part of our mortgage interest, some of our clothing, is all paid for before the 100k income, so really with those perks its like 110k.

I'm gonna try to wait for the dip, and then right before I click buy I am gonna stop... and then I am gonna wait for the dip that ALWAYS happens the second I think I am buying "the dip".

Great points.

However I want to warn people, preworkout may cause anxiety as a side effect. I used to take pwo before every single gym session and it would guarantee fucking extreme pumps. Loved it.

However it started to impact my professional performance. I started to become shaky as shit, and it would cause my voice to tremble during leadership/management presentations. I now stick with black coffee.

While the pricing of options may be abnormal by other measures put call parity still generally holds even for stocks like this 

Put call parity:
B+C = S+P

Otherwise restated as:
C=S+P-B

Here's the current pricing on April $40 calls/puts 1.8/23.4

The stock is at ~$19

1.8 (C) = 19 (S) + 23.4 (P) - 40.6 (B - plug to get this)

Notice how the short bond position is roughly $40? This isn't random, the call strike is $40. You're essentially borrowing $40 when you buy the call $40 strike call. This shows put/call parity is still holding.

What Bella Thorne did to you? 😎😎
What they mean when they say that is actually 

* Buy and hold
* Diversify
* Rebalance from time to time.

No one thinks that you should buy and hold one thing forever because that one thing might go bankrupt and you might be missing out on something else which is sky rocketing. What they mean by "buy and hold" is don't fucking sell because of short term dips. If you time them wrong it can be disaaaaastrous cause not only do you sell for a loss of whatever% but if you don't get back in before things come back up you could miss out on huge gains on the up swing. 

From this article: https://www.fool.com/investing/2020/12/31/missing-just-a-few-of-the-best-stock-market-days-c/

>How much exactly? 
JPMorgan's asset management arm has put an exact price to these missed days in its Guide to Retirement report. If you invested $10,000 into the S&P 500 on Jan. 3, 2000 and left it completely invested until Dec. 31, 2019, you would've received an average annual return of just over 6%. Your $10,000 would've grown to $32,421.

>This 20-year period of time includes roughly 5,000 days during which the stock market was open. But as the table below shows, if you missed just the 10 best days out of those 5,000, you'd have less than half as much money. Miss the best 20 days, and you'd barely have made any money at all over 20 years, and you'd have lost money if you missed more winning days.

Time Invested Since Jan. 3, 2000	
Dollar Value 	Annualized Performance

* Fully invested into S&P 500	$32,421	6.06%

* Missed 10 best days 
$16,180	2.44%

* Missed 20 best days
$10,176	0.08%

* Missed 30 best days 
$6,749	(1.95%)

* Missed 40 best days 
$4,607	(3.8%)

* Missed 50 best days
$3,246	(5.47%)

* Missed 60 best days
$2,331	(7.02%)

Well let me know how it goes
I bought AAPL call expiring in October back in July. Can’t even remember the strike but near the money. AAPL took a dive for a week or so and I sold at maybe 60% loss, then they proceeded to announce the stock split and it mooned. Missed out on a ten + bagger. Fml never doubt Timmy
Wanna hear a joke? PLTR calls. AHAAAHAH.
Same, jumped in on the recent dip because I feel like I’ve gone too long without losing money on FD’s. Probably will paper hand mid January 🙃
Some of people I know buying ppv matches for wrestling and ufc are living paycheck to paycheck. Almost become a routine for them.
Hmm... those kids are employed.
I agree the paradigm is shifting with voters choosing to de-criminalize marijuana. And with Philip Morris and such buying up seed patents its only a matter of time before they lobby our representatives. I just have little faith in our government in actually doing something in the interest of the american people. Not to get too /r politics but look at how long it took them to pass another stimulus and look at all the shady games they played and vacations they took while a great portion of Americans suffered. All Im saying is, I wouldn’t put money down on our government doing its job.

I have been wondering for lately if Cohen has a very large amount of ITM calls waiting to exercise. 

He would not have to disclose these shares until he actually owns them. 

I can see a world where he has another 10% of the shares in his back pocket ready to play at the right time.
Doubling every year is almost impossible. But similar to that is possible at 1.2-1.5 gain. Just buy a SPAC that is priced around 10-11. Assuming any SPAC can find a target merger company within a year and merging news bumps up the price by 20-40 percent within a few weeks (eg BFT) you can consistently increase ur asset without a huge risk. By doing this you can technically outperform the market in the long run as long as SPAC stays as a popular method for listing.
This is the confirmation I was looking for, getting at it
Thank you for the reply. Yet another great reason to boycott and buy puts!

Positions: doesn’t matter if you’re all in
Copy-paste of a comment I made somewhere else:

What PLTR offers is a quick way to make a Knowledge Graph (KG), filled with data. Which you can then ask questions and interact with visually. Google Search, Wikipedia, Facebook, Uber: they all use a KG to some extent. The power of a KG over traditional tabular datasets (think rows and columns) is that a KG allows you to infer information from the data, which you have not made explicit for yourself. Governmental bodies have been using/developing KG's for a longer period of time, and you can see now that commercial companies see the value in it as well. Just go to Youtube and search for 'Uber Knowledge Graph'. It's relatively dry material, but the Uber vids are short and to the point.

The fact that it is dry material also explains part of the fact that fucknuggets like Jim Cramer don't understand what they do, and what the implied value is of their offering. It's like trying to explain to my parents what a webbrowser is. It's not their fault, they just don't understand.

But people don't need to truly understand. You don't know how a Ferrari is made, but you know it's a gorgeous, fast, Italian, expensive, and - above all - quality car. You don't truly understand, but the story around Ferrari explains it to you in a way. The same applies to Palantir. You see how they support in making sure the vaccination process is a success. You don't know exactly how, but you know they do. At the end of the day it's very simple: data is raw information, pieced together by context. PLTR offers the best way to distill information out of heaps of data.

**TLDR**: look up 'uber knowledge graph' on Youtube to understand what a KG is. Then imagine PLTR lets you do what Uber does themselves, only in 3 weeks, with 10x the amount of data sources.
That’s a fair point and probably true. But the way I see it is if we were saying to buy in at 15 and it goes to 30-45 within a year, that’s not exactly a modest gain
Not my proudest nut
Don't worry. If you need to have a greater rate of return, you can ask for your broker to allow you to trade options. No more worrying about stocks doubling. Just get a sweet 10 bagger per month and be done in a year.

It’s tough with the gyms closed. It’s cliche but, honestly push-ups are great for beginners for at home workouts. It can help you focus on the squeeze you need when working chest. Think about trying to hold a quarter between your pecs, that’s how it should feel when you hit the top of a push up. Just focus on keeping tension in your chest through the whole movement. If your back starts hurting you’re doing it wrong. Once you have that down you can start using those dumbbells for press. Keep a proud chest, brace your core, and drive upward. Again, make sure you keep that tension in your chest throughout the movement. If you lose it just stop and reset

REGN February calls/call spreads. Rough calculation on a 500/550 spread shows a possible 290% profit in less than 2 months if the stock goes to $550 by Feb 19, which is still lower than where the stock was on their last earnings. 550/600 spread would by a 10 bagger if it hits $600 in 49 days.

1. DD Global Holdings: 62,299,069 shares of Common Stock: 26.4%
2. Champ Key Limited: 17,189,210 shares of Common Stock
3. DD Global is wholly owned by Champ Key. Champ Key is wholly owned by DE Capital. DE Capital is wholly owned by Mr. Pak Tam Li (Hong Kong) —-> meaning Mr. Li owns 79,488,279 shares of Common Stock out of the 235M outstanding common stock!! 

So does this imply 33.7% of Canoo is effectively owned by Mr. Li?

It was also like 2$, I don’t think it’ll be doubling, maybe it goes to $55 -$60 but the real news will be before NIO day (which is Saturday and not a trading day) when they release their December sales numbers for 2020, that’s the news I care about, everything else is nothing (could be like Tesla battery day remember that trash?) unless they announce some new tech or deal that’s ready to be released early or something (which is doubtful). I’m holding 300 shares and 3 $30 2023 calls bought in august but I don’t expect a big pump next week (although it would be nice)

Usually I wouldn’t post stuff like this in here, but markets are closed for a few days and I know this applies to some of you. **If you’re an aspiring gym bro give it a read, if not scroll by.**

Okay boys it’s the new year and I know some of you idiots are drooling thinking over the absolutely sick 6 pack you’re going to have next summer after you start going to the gym. You know, because you signed a hypothetical contract between your smooth brain and the rotation of the Earth or whatever. Here are some tips from someone who has been working out for 5 years and has a subjectively decent physique.

-Tip 1- Use your stupid money brain to your advantage. You don’t have to get addicted to the gym but you can get addicted to a pre-workout you take before the gym. Get a decent tasting pre-workout with 200-250mg of caffeine. Don’t go too crazy or you’ll end up sick more often than pumped. Fuck anyone that says pre-workout is shit. This dose of caffeine is fine to take and a little bit of Sucralose isn’t going to kill you. Most pres have beta alanine and if you haven’t taken it before you’re going to feel like a crackhead but this calms down and personally I love the feeling. This craving of a quick dopamine spike will motivate you to get your ass off the couch. Half the battle is getting into your car to drive there.

-Tip 2- No one fucking cares how much weight you push if your form is shit. Start with low weight and focus on good form. I know you think the chick across from you in the lulus is dripping watching you snap your spine deadlifting 405, but she’s actually going gone to her boyfriend and laughing about the retard she saw in the gym punishing every collective joint in his body in one swift motion. No one is looking at you thinking you’re a pussy for deadlifting 135, actually they are probably mentally congratulating you for not being a buffoon like half the New Year guys. 

-Tip 3- No one will tell you this, but you actually burn a minimal amount of calories during a lifting session. Your most intense workout of weight training will probably burn less than 300 calories. Before you get home and congratulate yourself with a pint of ice cream remember that you will be gaining back those calories burned and some. You will still build muscle, but you will put on fat.  

I’m not going to make this any longer than it is, because I know you guys have trouble with the whole “reading” thing. But feel free to ask questions/discuss. As dumb as you are I love you mother fuckers and I want to see you succeed

Someone mentioned to me the other day that being poor at Christmas is doubly tough for grade school children. They come back and see friends getting Switch games, and they got a little car or doll etc. They think it's because Santa doesn't like them and such. Was suggested that parents give the expensive gifts and leave less expensive presents from Santa. Thought that was a great idea (as is donating to charities overall).

Most active fund failed to maintain growth. Ark did a fantastic job last year but it would be difficult to expect such growth. Best show would be 120-125 range which is somewhat reasonable as long as her bets on gene editing companies don’t fail too drastically in upcoming years. Just saying she is still bagholding some bad companies (less than 1%), such as Organovo, which has been struggling for almost a decade.

[deleted]
Bruh.
I think that 3% was just to test the waters to see how the market would react. It jumping to 25% upon news and holding it there for 2 weeks, that’s good enough data points. It also suggests there is a lot of cash waiting on the sidelines ready to jump in GME. My guess would be the next buy in could be double last week’s (7%) upping his totally ownership to 20%.

This is just such a perfect timing technically (cup and handle forming since Dec. 1), sales numbers coming up (I suspect it’ll come next week), and then the conference. 

They also probably don’t want each news to overshadow each other - they would want to jump off each other to build the momentum. I suspect 13D filing early next week to jump start the momentum, sales numbers mid-late next week to sustain the momentum, and the the conference the week after that for a complete explosion.
Uh, it was closed today.

So did we ever figure out why tf SPY shot up yesterday?
[deleted]
Yeah and that’s if they can even successfully mass produce the product.  This is definitely going back under $30, but its just a matter of how long it will take to get there. I think that a Citron or Hindenburg will put out a short report on them soon.
NVDA is also going to be partnering with multiple car companies including Mercedes to program AI into the cars for self driving and stuff. This could start as soon as 2022. Easily a 1000+ company

I'm still surprised they killed the $2,000 bill after tacking on Section 230, rather than sending it to the House to kill it because of the Section 230 stuff.

Nice. Doing similar with basically just apple and maybe PLTR for all of 2021. Main things I’m doing different compared to most theta gang strategies is setting stop losses once any covered calls are over 20% profit so if the underlying stock starts to moon I can hopefully avoid one of the downsides (missing out on large profits)
May as well put a link to buy the print.
I'm pretty sure PLTR will be a major badass company.  I'm in for 3,000 shares so far.  About to get 1,000 more. What do you guys think?
If you had 50k to play, what would you play to get 100% returns in 3 months?

Excellent 6 months. KTOS did excellent for me. Big gains were on SPY and QQQ options on very lucky days. Big losses were AMD and a few others. I put in like 1200 of my own money and I've taken out almost that much. It's a cool feeling to be playing with almost all house money at this point. Might put a bit more in over the next few weeks. Learned a TON in the process, like that I'm TERRIBLE at daytrading, but my 2-3 week plays tend to work out.
That's depressing.

The AR/VR momentum is nothing like it was in the past. The technology was not ready before. The products being put out, and that are in the pipeline are drastically better than they used to be, and the processing power to run amazing applications is finally here. Look into Hololens, and see how many businesses are going to be using it. It is going to be monstrous this time around. You are, way off the mark on AR being a gimmick. You need to think more deeply about all the possible applications outside of putting rainbow animations on buildings. See links below.

Facebook, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft, Snapchat, and a number of other huge players are investing massive sums right now for the AR/VR world over this next decade.

Hey guys I'm a pretty new investor, just started a month ago, up about 2k with a small initial investment of 5k, I've been moving most of my profits out of my meme brokerage and slowly building a schwab retirement account that I don't intend to touch for some decades, in this account, I'm focusing on dividends, tech, semiconductors and recently debating to invest in some ETFs for the long-term.

I really love to invest in tech, robotics, AI, renewable etc.

How is that wrong? If you 5x your money, depending on your starting capital, in what world would that not be a livable wage? People literally make a living off this shit without 500% yearly gains. 

We get it, your not in on GME and that’s fine. But to say something as stupid as a 500% gain wouldn’t make a livable wage is just incorrect. Your $1000 account maybe not but everyone isn’t playing penny slots.

Edit: 400% gains. Either way statement is the same.

It’s really peanuts in the $40’s range. Anything above $50 is extortion. If you have the patience, go 90 days out and buy in the $40’s or high to mid $30’s. Put premiums are more reasonable in that price range.

Solid strategy although I really doubt that you will "only" double the account. Especially with wheeling, you want to get assigned. Current premiums with PLTR are so high that you make money for entry and money for exit. Rinse, repeat.

The party is just getting started
Yeah, but JD.com is literally like 2 employees and 200 robots for both warehouse work and deliveries (drones). 

Imagine being in one of the cheapest labor markets in the world, and still pump money into cutting labor out completely religiously. Also, their drone aspect makes them much more ready to supply more rural areas of china with blazing delivery times. 

Moon isn't the limit, it's the starting line.
This....especially with puts, I’d avoid short term UNLESS momentum dictates otherwise. If the market runs a train on a stock, it’s worth getting in and out on an ITM PUT or worth burning a day trade for a small account.
It'd be nice if they would. I kinda doubt it though. Still, never know unless you ask.
I hear that. That's why I work and don't slack off, I'm in an MBA program because the longer you sit in one spot the quicker people give up on you, and we are getting her enrolled for a Masters in Scotland after we move there because she knows I expect out of her what I expect out of myself. Her personality forces her to earn more than I do. That means I make sure she has to work to make that happen.

Three things: 1) early Jan is traditionally bullish. 2) Stimulates checks hit over the weekend. 3) BABA is significantly undervalued due to the hits it took in late December. Last time it took a hit like this, Trump was threatening tariffs. It came back in a big way within a few weeks.

Your $600 buys a couple hundred 🍄 shares. Lots of big catalysts coming.

recently announced the successful completion of a pre-IND (Investigational New Drug) meeting with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regarding the development of lysergic acid diethylamide (LSD) assisted therapy for an anxiety disorder. 

🍄 said preliminary data has been analyzed for its addiction treatment program evaluating the ibogaine derivative 18-MC, which the company named Project Layla. The preliminary data from the Phase 1 Multiple Ascending Dose (MAD) and Single Ascending Dose (SAD) study has shown that the drug is safe and well tolerated at the doses tested to date, and no Serious Adverse Events (SAEs) have been reported.

They also applied to be listed on NASDAQ. When that goes through, gonna rocket so fast. A lot of RHers have it on their radar but cant buy because robinhood sucks.



Psychedelics are the future for treating mental health disorders.


Honestly, the offering ends soon and anything under the offering price you should buy up. This was hittings the 5s before that and should go right back there.
Just buy SKLZ and get 100% on easy mode.
You should know math isnt a strong suit here

The premium on the Puts is also quite high.
Sweeeeeeet 😉🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
This post was very confusing for me. I see rockets, but I also sense a negative tone. Does the wealth killer refer to GME's customers because they will keep coming back to buy more?
I also read this tweet

You're absolutely right. This isn't the same situation as TSLA bc people are actually buying that and the data shows. Nobody wants doordash at all. Im gonna hop on this one as well and buy a long put or two. Fuck doordass

Surely the best thing the USA could do for Pakistani women is to give each and every one of them access to level 4 options trading? 🤔🇺🇲🇵🇰
My plan is to put everything in Apple call after correction this year. And my prediction is they gonna launch Apple car earlier than they planned. They will try to move things faster to hop on the EV hype train. If they are really thinking to release cars in 2024, they will be less likely to succeed. TLDR $180 calls 2023
That movie was solid
>I wonder how many different ways I could fuck this up

you could buy PLTR calls I suppose
Have you tried reaching out to Reddit to see if they will support infrastructure expenses like that? I'm sure they are making absolute bank off of this sub. Ads for finance-specific audiences are ridiculously expensive and this is probably the most concentrated digital audience out there. As long as you can justify the expenses go towards making the sub better and ultimately more profitable for them, they may be willing to help.
Those ones you are seeing are the ones I have. Sorry I didn't put it in correctly, but those ones you wrote are the right ones. The strikes are weird because ARKG issued a dividend and that changed all of the strikes and made them lower by a bit, and so they are all strange and have decimals.
Say no more fam, good enough DD for me.
doesn't Jeff hate investors?
A bunch of positive articles about analysts expecting them to grow the most out of the FAANG stocks in 2021, how 9 out of 10 phones bought for the holidays were iPhones, the buzz about the iCar, and of course the ER which will give clarity on (hopefully) all of the above things. Stock has gone down 5% since all of these articles lol, consolidating for what I expect (hope)  to be a big run up
Nah, Robinhood gave me level 2 options access less than 20 minutes after I opened my account even though I'm unemployed and told them, lol.

Speaking of people thinking retail investors would pour into Amazon if they had a stock split, I remember ads for close ended funds and ETFs with their Amazon and Berkshire Hathaway holdings as their main selling points.

Feels so alien with fractional shares.
Holiday sales coming out 1/11 right? So you’re saying sell 1/8 or early 1/11
Robinhood looks at resumes?

Lol dude I literally wrote it already: just long apple!
CRSP market cap is 11 billion. That is not considered small cap. ARK has 10% invested in Tesla, which has skyrocketed. What other ETFs have that much allocated to TSLA? Hes right that a good percentage of the increase is attributed to inflows, but that doesnt mean this wont blow out the competition over the next 10 years.

I didn't say the decade so far. I'm saying in the period between 2020 and 2029. It's no secret that the economy was artificially inflated even before the virus.

When the bubble does burst, it's gonna crash even further from the bears, and that's the time to buy in for big gains.
You don't have to sell covered calls for all your shares 🤦

There is soooo much DD out there. Way too much to post here, but definitely search the sub for "GME." Good stuff in the DDs and Discussions.
RemindME! 365 days "INTC?"
i want it to go down because I want to re-enter TSLA. I'm a huge bull lol. but this price action is super unsustainable imo so i want it to dip.
Does he stream trading or vidya?
An actual valid bear thesis will be great. Does not matter how much net worth that person has. We have folks who put their life savings in way OTM TSLA options and made more than 10mill, does not mean they are worth listening to :)

If you do want to go by net worth, we have much higher net worth (and knowledgeable) folks on both sides of this and there are rumors that the current shorts are amid failing negotiations with other big guys to get out of their short positions.

Saying "don't kill yourself when this tanks to 10" smacks of either envy or misplaced arrogance.

Why you feeling good? I got a bunch of Baba Calls all day thursday and I dont feel good. 1/15 240c. Im way too over leveraged in this one. Its basically an inadvertant yolo.
The trend is your end.
I'm selling everything else except Tesla and putting 6 figures in this. Already have 25% in at 16.21
When it comes to call options, I’m buy curious.
Eventually the ball will fall in black and you will be rewarded.
10% of shares at 40, 
20% at 55, 
50% at 70, 
20% at 100.
Maybe not a biological one.
Just watch out in case you ever lose your edge or find yourself in real trouble - "fuck everybody else" can turn into "fuck you" in a heartbeat.

-30% during the pandemic. No idea what my AT high is from the charts since I keep putting money in.

Got some QQQ from Thanksgiving last year up 48%.
I usually go right up til the point I'm going to pop then stop. But sometimes it's just animalistic and just gotta buy some 🍄 stonks.

Consolidating right now in order to blast off to new ATH. 140 EOW, 150 after ER
Next week is gonna be our week.  Had to endure a lot of pain the last few, but this thing is gonna rocket 🚀 in the first few weeks of Jan.  Would not be surprised if it’s over $30 by Jan 8.  I’ve got 9500 shares at avg price of $27 and I’m not selling.

Edit: GME 🚀💎🙌
Could have bought about 11 shares of GME with that. That’s how you actually pay it forward.
move over to trading futures, its pretty much the same minus like three greeks
Etrade offers this
Do you remember the runup on Tesla for battery day? Now imagine that with a stock that's even more accessible to retail due to price.

I get your point but even if there's nothing actually special about the event, events similar seem to cause a run up with these kind of events.
Earnings and shit
Can MMs actually manipulate it that much? It’s a 2T company with humongous buy back power. MMs could barely keep Tesla under 700 last Friday even though they tried their best.
Idk what you said but thank you for your service
https://news.gamestop.com/node/18351/html

Up to $100 Million bucks worth. If released today would be about 5.25 million shares. The initial shock did more harm to GME stock holders (read squeeze holders) than the 5 million shares would the squeeze. Just kinda took the air out of the room when it was announced. And of course the price dropped. The share price is $2 higher today than it was that day so that’s a positive.
What’s your AT +/-

I'm sure it's fine, just makes no sense calling it a mustang.

Yeah, you are probably right about the smart money already being in. Iron ore and steel prices spiked hard, and there’s so much that’s happened in dec, but stocks stayed flat or trailed down a little, last 2 weeks. Seems like there’s a lot of room for them to run still, maybe people just trying to read the tea leaves with earnings? If what you say is correct, stocks are going to pop hard if they set big guidance. But most of these producers seem to try to be conservative with guidance. X for example, they took a hit guiding down, but I bet they beat it expectations.

Ha, no it's a self-hosted instance, that's for their cloud product. I'm paying like $50-100ish a month out of pocket for our bots and stuff right now, but that's not the cost of metabase, it's 3 VPSes and a managed database cluster. Honestly we need a bit more server power and a GPU-enabled VPS so I can get the data ingestion script off my desktop. It's using my 2080 to read the text in all the pics rn.

We're stuck in a limbo of me being too cheap, not being able to find a suitable cloud VPS type thing, and being uncomfortable with appealing to the sub to organize/fund any of it. Perhaps I'll get pytorch to compile for my old 780ti and I can run it (the GPU-accelerated OCR bits) off of that, but then all of our bots go down if my home internet dies.
So, in what quarter will Fedex and UPS sign contracts for Foundry ?

I’ve been running credit spreads on ETFs way ITM recently.  High probability of profit, not much return, seems to be a great way to generate a revenue stream though.   Interested to see how this plays out.
Tesla going down after you already sold it has no effect on you. This isn’t a zero sum game. Everyone else doesn’t have to lose in order for you to win. We can all make tendies together.

Flying down the freeway right now about 20 cops behind me and im running out of gas, and I couldnt care less because I have ICLN leaps 😌
For 1 lucky guy there are 999 unlucky ones. You don’t hear about them. 
AAPL leaps.
Hahahhhah yeah its hurting but think of it this way. Remember when bagholding Tesla at 350 was the big thing? What about now? Hold tight
Make **$2** a month in dividends
OP forgot to include you can write it off only on income not capital gains unless the capital gains money you lost already had taxes paid on it. Meaning you had that money last year paid taxes on it and lost it now
That’s not a long hold at all

What effect do you think it’ll have on pltr
It can go down 100%, but the upside potential is limitless!
I had a nightmare SNAP went down by like 20% in one day last week.

Why? I don't know. I only own one share I got for free when I opened an account.

What’s gonna be AAPL price after earnings

Yeah bro, Jackie reses is going to be such an asset to starlink. I followed psth and had 10k shares at one point. You are delusional if you think there’s a chance in hell psth has anything to offer Elon musk.

You can do it on their site, otherwise I’d reach out directly. To be safe you’d want to do this ahead of the proxy. We’ll probably know by early March this is the route Cohen is taking for certain.
Good shit u/zjz appreciate you bro
Can’t decide if I want to write a bunch of calls the day before. I’m just afraid they’ll dazzle everyone and I’ll get btfo with a 100% pop or something and be eternally cucked out of my shares
What dates we thinking? Been looking into some put options but with how retarded our current market is im worried it'll somehow stay propped up longer than expected
Insider trading. It's badass as hell
Yes, they said to buy PLTR.
[deleted]
Jesus dude 😳
These retards still think the stock will jump $50 in a day. The stock goes up to 20 pr 21 and then crashes bc nobody is retarded enough buy that high. Then the wsb retards that do buy high sell their shares and pretend to hold. You won't see the pumpers buying the shares at 20 or 21 either bc nobody wants to 😂😂😂 thats why buying puts at the top keeps making bears money. The volume exists on GME for a reason and you have to be retarded and not know shit about the market to think that whole volume is people buying shares
Fucking Fool FUD.

I need to know about a 10 bagger play before other people do. How tf do people get so lucky
That amount of money can enter or exit the market on any given week through large funds or big individual players. Ecspecially since a lot of this money will enter small caps, this is just not enough to prop up the market as a whole. 

My take: The $600 will increase consumer spending, but won't drastically change next quarterly earnings. We will continue upward because of the hopes for the $2000 checks, the Georgia runoffs, and the gradual return to normal process thay has begun due to the vaccine. I think we can ride these catalysts for a good while.
I wish I had put more into Bionano. I might not make it to mars, but I'll settle for the moon.

>By 2008, Lehman had assets of $680 billion supported by only $22.5 billion of firm capital. From an equity position, its risky commercial real estate holdings were thirty times greater than capital. In such a highly leveraged structure, a 3 to 5 percent decline in real estate values would wipe out all capital.[84]

No dude you're just a brain dead chimp. Glad you're finally realizing it bud. I hear special Ed classes help with reading
Things I did poorly in 2020: Stayed a bear **WAY** too long (until late May), missing out on $650k. 

Things I did well: Design positions that had an “escape plan”, and learn to get rid of my losers before they became knockout blows. 

Net gains in 2020: $150k.
This is my plan too
Ya, this doesnt seem like it'll move until earnings.

Does GME still have upside? I don't get how their business model holds up considering all games are going online a la cloud. Someone care to explain?

I dunno why this was so funny but I actually laughed out loud.
Give up on PLTR, go all in GME

Let me simplify it for your crack baby brain. QS shot up faster than the speed of light. It HAS to drop and will until it’s in the 20’s ($23-$27). That’s realistic range for fuking batteries. 
Unless there is a massive uptick in deals with automakers, it’ll continue the slide into Q1 2021.

My JAN 2023 NEE calls won't go tits up unless their next two years together underperform literally every other two years together for the last 10 year.
I'm good at timing the top.  Like after I buy it doesn't go up a few cents and immediately crashes.
Should be late q1/early q2
Not with RH instant deposit
You need to utter those magic words:

Buy high, sell low

Now tell me how I can get some of the money back. Need to perform both side of the magic.
MJ did super well in 2020 so im expecting a slight pullback. Thats why im a big fan of active ETFs that can adjust as needed. I gotta look into JETs i never heard of it.

AAPL?  Or better yet just SPY?
Yo what up thugger.
Without knowing the specific technical details of their tech, I’d say they sell data and analytics services to public and private entities.

I do know that they are trying to shift toward becoming more SaaS than they are now, which will cut down their operational costs and widen margins.

I like PLTR and if you had a script to dig into post history you could find me shilling about PLTR just after it DPO’d. I’m not gonna be that guy, but I could pull up my posts saying “I’m gonna buy some shares, you guys are missing out” in a thread filled with people shitting on it at $10

I took intro and intermediate micro as well as macro. none of that helped me with anything
shares don't either. all our shares being rehypothetcated unless they're in a cash account. i literally only have 1 cash account broker and i'm holding shares in that but i need to have margin to do my other trading so fuck shares in those accounts. calls need to be delta hedged anyways by MM
$140 in a week? I think this is wishful thinking, but fuck it lets go 🚀🌕👨‍🚀

Microsoft is killing it since it entered the space. PowerBI is replacing so many of the tools due to their competitive offering. Even seeing all the computers replaced with Microsoft tablets! I’m hugely bullish on Microsoft with teams, power Bi, tablets, sql server offerings and their integration with databricks. No experience with it but if they are killing it with the complementary products I would imagine databricks would do quite well.

Speaking of NVIDIA, have they fired their lunatic director of machine learning research after her Twitter shit hit the fan or that bitch is still working for the company. Because if it's the latter, I have a great feeling we'll see something like that happen in the future (or her shit venting would backhit them in some other way) and the market would sell instantly. Oh wait, she did delete her pathetic Twitter account but what's once been posted online stays out there forever (thank lord for that).

Either way, $NVDA has a time bomb on their hands and I'm not touching their stuff until they come clean. Too much of a risk.

It’s based on AGI. So if you both made $175k combined, maxed out your 401k’s, filed jointly and had no other write offs like donations or mortgage interest. Your AGI would be $175k - $39k= $136k and you would get the full $1200.

If Amazon wants to dominate the gaming sector, you are right and I think they can do real damage. But that’s any sector. If Amazon wants to dominate pet-related sector, they can undercut prices and ruin other pet-related businesses as well. How can Chewy sustain business when they are all in pets? 

But they won’t. Cuz it’s not their vision to dominate any sector. They are more of a general store and don’t want to be associated with any particular sector. If anything tech and books but no particular consumer-specific sectors.

Over trading and impatience
Look at Jan 1/15 30c, the price for those went up even tho GME went down on Friday

=IV expansion. Look at how many options are open 1/15. Its like 25% of the float expiring on that day. Melvin, if you followed the 54k July put volume, opened a lot of the Jan puts

Melvin's gonna short the fuck out of this no matter what the blowout numbers are, and Melvin will put up a bunch of articles about "GME posts record profits, but will it be enough? Investors don't think so"

The play for the short term is short dated calls and sell before holiday numbers come out. IV gonna be thru the roof because of expectations of a blow out. The blow out will happen, but Melvin is also going to short after. DO NOT BE LEFT WITH THE BAG FRONT RUN MELVIN, buy short dated calls for 1/15 and sell the 4 to 24 hours before the holiday sales numbers come out

They appear to have a very unique product that is industry specific. None of the competitors are doing this. They combine value added products with data warehousing and analytics, which is what I think is key in selling the product. It’s one thing to offer a generic product and have developers such as myself build you what you’re looking for. But then what do you do with it and how well can you integrate it with automation? And industry specific automation? That’s where I think they excel. Disclaimer that I haven’t worked in PLTR so this is just based off what I read on their site.

Yeah. That makes sense. I mean AMZN is 1000 times bigger than GME and BBY is 25 times bigger. So I don’t expect them to be as successful as those two to be honest. And you are right, GME can probably optimize their business more to cut all the unnecessary costs to be profitable, but it also seems they have a plan and strategy to cut costs where they can.
When I used to work in finance, my friend and I used to jump around and look into random boomer accounts on down days for fun. Lot of them were in the millions and held lot of typical boomer stocks/bonds but there was this one particular account that caught our eye because he only had two holdings with one being AMZN. He held  1200~ or some shares with like a $1~ average per cost. When we checked his history man legit opened the account a month or two before the IPO and bought 100 shares and diamond handed(or forgot??). I don't work there anymore but I always wonder on random days if the guy ever checked his account or is even alive. Probably will give it to his son with a step up rule if I was him

I have yet to work with any company that is fully cloud based, so I can’t speak much on this, but I can say there’s a shift in the industry to go cloud based. The biggest prior concern was on data security. I’m not sure what their differentiator is, but I can tell you 99% of large corporations are not cloud based, at least in my experience. So huge potential for the entire industry. I’m working with Gov. organizations now and they are diverting to cloud, so that should tell you something as they are often the last movers.

Their software is leagues ahead of their competition and effective. Governments aren’t going to cheapskate on software that doesn’t work. 

If that alone doesn’t convince you, cofounder Thiel cofounded PayPal with papa Elon and is a well known billionaire across silicon valley. Why would you hate money so much as to bet against him?
Hm interesting.. or would you rather have one 450 bagger?
This is true. 
It’s not just market cap growth. It’s stock buy backs too

Alex Karp has a Palantir Covid-19 special event with Washington Post columnist David Ignatius.

>At the outset of the coronavirus pandemic, U.S. data analytics company Palantir Technologies was tapped by over a dozen governments around the world including the U.S. government to use its software to manage the data about the spread of COVID-19, analyze trends and anticipate various needs across the supply chain. Alexander Karp is CEO and one of several co-founders of Palantir. On Thursday, Jan. 7 at 10:00 a.m. ET, Karp will join Washington Post columnist David Ignatius to talk about the challenges faced by governments around the world in relying on technology and software to respond to the pandemic.

Does anyone recommend any Reddit phone app to browse this sub? The ones I looked at were good for scrolling through images and memes but I usually only look at text-heavy subs.

I just go on Reddit.com on my chrome app, just wondering if there was something better for subs like this one, especially for reading text posts rather than links/images.

People in general don’t understand data and have no idea what PLTR does. They don’t understand that PLTR is revolutionizing data integration and data management, not even mentioning model deployment. Its just like nobody understood why Apple or MSFT was revolutionary until they took over the world. PLTR will launch. It’s just going to take time. Years. Buckle up tards and keep buying. It will be the standard for data management in the future and data is starting to run the world. Godspeed tards, godspeed

Inverse me up, Scotty.
So hear me out here: why are we only talking about porn? I could see Twitter subscriptions becoming huge for other types too. Think about all the youtube "gurus" out there for every get-rich-quick scheme or fitness plan or whatever. Most of those guys have a website where they sell you on some sort of daily/weekly subscription service for their mentorship. Imagine how easy it would be for them to not have to create a whole website or shoot & edit YouTube videos and instead could just drop a stream of consciousness to their paid Twitter subscribers. Even day traders could just explain and disclose what their moves are as they're doing them. People would pay to have that information, and everyone already has a twitter, which makes it that much easier. And then the cherry on top is the porn.

I think this has potential. But I probably wouldn't invest until it is confirmed because I think a lot of people (like those in this thread) would be skeptical at first.
As long as you follow the two rules of dating.

I don’t really wanna explain what I do professionally and tried to ignore that part of your comment below, but believe you me, I’ve been around this business for quite a long time. Having said that, always up for learning and if you are a professional in business optimization, I would like to learn more from you. 

But let’s move away from personal attacks and focus on the topic at hand. Maybe I’m looking at the wrong place, but I haven’t seen anything to indicate Amazon or GME is taking loss on game sales. They are probably taking less margins due to the competition, but not taking loss. GME also doesn’t only sell games. Like others, they sell other game-related items with high margins. You are right if their business is 100% focused on selling games, they are in a pickle, but that’s not the case from what I understand - especially if they start expanding their product offerings into PC and other game related business areas.

It’s weird, everybody’s crying about being poor and needing the stimmy while they’re flying around the country infecting everybody.
I know diamond hands and all, but what price will you sell your GME? 30, 40? Also, if/when the MOASS happens, will it be impossible to not notice? Or will just be gradual ups?
A week or two ago, someone posted similar DD on $DASH, and me, being brand new, ate it up.  I wanted to try one of those "FD"s everyone always talks about, so I bought a few 12/31 $145p (it was trading at 155ish).  Was down $1500 and ready to write it off, but the next day dipped down to 145 and I sold my puts at a loss of about 30-40%.  Of course, next day it goes straight down to 140.  

I think you're definitely right about people selling off after the lockup, but I have no idea how to predict the strike

Not sure you really realize just how much $1 billion is. It's an insane amount. I'm not sure anyone has the balls to hold from 1 million to 20 million or even 100 million. Such a life changing and generation changing amount of money

Obvious that you don’t have that much money, cause loss aversion doesn’t change more. See 15k gain and then lose 15k same effect as losing 500 if your portfolio and net worth is proportionally lower.
What is this profit taking I keep hearing about? Do you think more of it will happen Monday? I don't like it makes my day red.
Yeah buy puts on his account

Can i have a platnum or is it too late
Biden isn’t issuing new lockdowns bc he doesn’t have the authority to do so. Most he can do is encourage people to wear masks and mandate it on federal buildings.
I don’t think it goes below 22 tbh
Not my field of expertise unfortunately. Also no longer at IBM.
Oh god. Good call
A fair pricing could be a multiple of sales. Current market cap is about 0.25 x sales. It may be a stretch to compare to other, profitable, companies; however pricing at 3 times sales is not unreasonable. Is a price of $200/share possible? Yes, but only if they adopt a proven sustainable business model they don’t currently have.

So I’m saying there’s a chance.

I guess basically during Pete’s first season on SNL Louis was a condescending piece of shit to all of the new guys but the big thing was he tried extremely hard to get him fired for smoking weed in his dressing room and the producers luckily weren’t going for it

Because a massive amount of robinhooders are way to invested into risky options plays, amd something like 98% of those accounts are losing money. Robinhood expedites this by selling out its users to the MMs, offers margin to all accounts, and gives unfettered access to 0dte options. Contrary to what you see on WSB, most of you Robinhood yards are going broke, and eventually all the retail money will dry up. Plus too many of you are also going into debt to play this game. Combine going into debt, going broke, and mass unemployment, Robinhood can easily trigger major economic fallout.
They’ve carved themselves a niche in the industry which is what I see as a differentiation. They have service specific BI, with additional value added features besides data warehousing and analytics. These are usually after the fact solutions but PLTR seems to have them integrated. I have not worked with the product, but I’ve worked with most of the big data analytics products, which are more geared to do whatever you want with what you can build.
Same, i decided to just hold it for the long run just like every person in this sub says.

I’ll answer that.

China is trying to slow down the price hike because they wanted to do a LOT of steel related construction this year. Now they either can’t, won’t, or are waiting for prices to drop.

Yes China is a powerhouse in the steel world. No, they can’t do jack fucking shit about this price increase.

If you think they’re really doing it for “carbon neutrality” you’re an ignorant fucking autist fucktard. China takes first place when it comes to “Fuck Earth.” 

China can get fucked and as far as steel is concerned, they are.
Bye bye to all that. Biden will hardly be tweeting as much as Trump and won’t publicly negotiate

Assuming the Senate will kill the $2000 stimulus aid, I can definitely see the “media” reporting on:

- Increase in COVID cases due to holiday gatherings 
- Florida being the 3rd state with the new variant of the 🦠, perhaps a 4th state will announce their case this weekend. 
- Potential lockdown plans under Biden’s first 100 days

Practically all doom and gloom. While the stonk market doesn’t always follow common sense, it does bring up the question on how Sunday futures will look. As well as what is and isn’t already priced in.

I’m going to be honest. I hardly ever use Facebook anymore I can’t last beyond 5 minutes until I’m mentally exhausted. I am willing to bet there are a lot more like me. I started to wonder why that was. I remember you used to earn your notifications. They are now handed out like candy. I’ll get on Facebook once or twice a day and each time I’ll have 9+ notifications. That is a death wish to a company that is in your mind. The moment you touch that annoying nerve you’re done. Calls on snap puts on FB
Yes
Why should I invest in such a shitstain company that can't even turn a profit and only gets govt contacts by underpricing below competition?
Good for you bro. I never learned and kept doubling down. Missed the biggest bull run

I’m not saying GME will make as much profit as AMZN or BBY do. I mean. We are comparing $1B company with $1.6T company after all. I’m not saying GME will be as successful as Amazon is. But I am saying GME can do at least 0.001 of what AMZN does easily.
What is your pltr position?
Yeah my kid is on the cocomelon drug too
I disagree with #2. To complete with them, the restaurant would have to get a bicycle or other advanced transportation vehicle to deliver the food. Pizza shops are still looking for a solution.
2k + maybe if the Dems actually win they can attempt to pass the 10k student loan forgiveness they were talking about. Unlikely but more likely than with a red senate.

It’s a dying business model thanks to being able to buy virtual copies of games and Amazon and other online retailers selling their other products for half the price. If anyone invests in $GME long term I suspect they’ll lose half of what they put into it at the least.

So essentially you're saying to write covered calls because we're in a good volatility environment to do so?
looks like retail sentiment on pltr has really taken a hit. If we see institutions starting to buy then we know that it will go up despite all of the negativity from tards getting burned on their calls
Fuck Mitch. Have hated him since 2016 lmao

Because Amazon can sustain losses and won’t effect them. If Amazon undercuts prices, how does GME sustain losses when they are all in on games? 

They have to match the prices to be competitive. How long can they keep it up against a juggernaut like Amazon? Amazon is willing to take a loss for a decade if it means they will have full control after a decade.
You’ll regret that when they pass tax increases

Closing stores is bullish for a business where brick and mortar is killing their bottom line. It’s normal to mass lay-off part timers after the holiday rush, even more so when 300+ stores are closing. Personal experience: worked at GME in high school. Depending on store size, 2 or 3 staff must be on hand at all times. Usually it’s 1 full timer and a rotation of part-timers. So every store closing is probably 4 or 5 part-timers getting laid-off.

Also, where I lived, I worked at the nearby mall GameStop. The foot traffic was near nil on the daily. This was a little over a decade ago. There was another GME location literally 3 miles away. The foot traffic there was, and still is, ridiculous. Enough that a boutique collectible store literally next door is able to operate from the residual customers.

Now, the digital part is very much a concern, and that is a very valid point. Still, they have a lot of cash on hand and are reducing and consolidating their physical footprint to free up more cash. 

If they fail to pivot to digital within the next 3 years, they are long term fucked. I’m betting on them surviving at the current price, long enough to cause the shorts to start bailing. Might be a slow burn, but that’s why I have shares lol
Hmm... Let me just think for you because with your IQ you're probably  incapable of doing it yourself

Depends on how you see it, if you ok with taking the 40-50 premium credit and stacking it with like 50 spreads to make about 2,500-3,000 with about 50,000 collateral. Then yes you can easily make about 3,500 weekly doing spreads but if you go farther up with a greater risk of a dip or correction then you can loose way more money. It really depends on your strategy and risk management but tbh all in total it’s worth it for a small gain each week so yes

I don’t understand your response. Your initial response said exactly what I predicted others may say, which is what I wrote the second paragraph. It’s not acquisition/retention strategy if your competitors also do the same thing. It’s a wash - there is no competitive advantage for this - they are just keeping up with the Jones. Second, GME doesn’t only sell games. The whole point they did that console order in store only a few weeks ago was to create the foot traffic - not to actually sell the console (since they could’ve done that online).
It’s up 300% since its March low, so it has moved - it was just very hard hit by COVID, even more so than cruise and airline stocks

I feel like other retailers aren't taking a loss on selling games because they aren't just running a game business.  It flows with the rest of their business.  For example best buy isn't just paying for space to sell games, like GME is.  And sure, GME sells other stuff, but I don't think Funko pops and classic records are gonna be enough to pay the rent let alone be profitable

I tried a rebuttal below. You obviously have no business sense so it’s impossible to explain to you why your logic is flawed.

I’ll try again. 

Amazon cheap. People buy. Amazon loses a little. They don’t care. 

GME matches Amazon price. They lose money. They can’t sustain losses. They go bankrupt.
GME tends to run up like it has been doing and then it tends to fall down and bottom around where it was right before doing so, check the 3M chart to see what I mean.
If you’re holding for all of 2021 I’d go for green energy. Tech is in a bubble and everyone knows it, could continue to run, but there’s likely another big-ish pullback incoming. Could be 2021, could be 2025. 

If the economy as a whole is doing well, green energy companies should become more valuable as government incentives are implemented (Biden administration can do this through discretionary spending and rule making authority, they won’t necessarily need congressional approval) and liberal state governments are likely to ramp up green energy spending too. If the Senate goes blue there’s a high likelihood of a green energy focused infrastructure bill. On a long enough time horizon, a massive green energy bubble should form.

I have ICLN leaps and I’m likely going to buy this ARRY dip and some other individual green energy companies.

I'm surprised your 401k provider let you have funds like that.
This sub has huge visibility. Imagine writing a well-researched and persuasive DD to pump your stock. Could probably be worth the effort.
The reason i say it is manipulated is exactly because it wasn't an IPO, usually funds etc get an headstart over retail, buy at a discount and then enjoy the price skyrocketing at the official IPO date. With PLTR they didn't have the chance, so now they are shorting until more shares are released.
It won't change much in the medium long term for leaps and shares holders, but it sure fucked many retailers playing JAN or DEC options because a non manipulated, realistic, EOY price, would have been a stable 33 with peaks into the 37s.

Just read the last few years of earnings reports. GME can’t compete on prices with AMZN and BBY because those companies don’t rely on games for their profits so they can sell that shit at a loss

GME as a business is dead within the next few years. Maybe as a stock there is some play to be made - but it all rests on Ryan Cohen being an idiot and dumping more of his money into it. That’s the only way out for bulls

I’ve been hearing a lot of people promoting DFEN as a long hold recovery play...think we eventually see a return to $60+ in the next few years
Hence my second paragraph. GME doesn’t only sell games.

And their competitors also sell games. So it’s a wash.
Interesting experiment: take a stock and buy in 2 diff accounts. For one, leave it alone the entire year. In the other, actively trade it daily or weekly or whatev and try to make better return and see what works better

Lol. You have absolutely no business acumen. It’s very clear with that statement. 

They see that loss in profit as a user acquisition/retention cost. You still bought from them instead of their competitors. One that hurts the competition. Two it keeps you on their website so you might buy other stuff with higher profit margins.

Operating at a loss is not a bad thing if you can secure a future market control if the industry. This is why Amazon operated most of their market at a huge loss for YEARS on purpose. To snuff out the online competition and secure their spot as the leader. They were supplemented by profits from AWS.

I skimmed the risks prospectus. Thanks. The video was super informative. I was thinking there was a little bit more voo-doo A.I. involved. I'm rethinking my outlook. I wonder if there would be some sort of macro or trained neuralnet within Palantir that an engineer or analyst could write that could automate his analysis of the potential Mexico City Toronto Vancouver cells that converged on chicago where it could be automated. Where you get that central player Mike Fisk or whoever, run the macro on him and find the three cell candidates. Y'know where it could be repeated and automated to act as a broad screening tool? That was a super informative video. Gives me a lot to think about. Really, thank you.

I think that you're making a very conservative bet with a strike of 220 at a 2023 expiration. I believe the stock is going to be well above 250 before summer. More could be made with a shorter expiration, say end of 2021 or in 2022, but your position is almost certainly going to print. Returns will just be smaller than a riskier (but in my opinion, still safe) position would offer.

I mean gamestop has the name and presence to actually have shot at becoming like "the gaming destination" but they'd have to move almost entirely digital with very thoughtfully placed brick and mortar, and have some sort of differentiating feature that sets them apart from all of their competition. If they could be a destination for all software and hardware for both consoles and PC along with having good prices, deals, subscription based rewards, etc, they honestly could survive long term and become something really great. It's a sliiiiiim chance since they're fighting basically everyone especially manufacturers and game developers who sell direct but it IS a possibility. They basically need to rework how they do everything.

This is the same kind of mentality I had for FB. I never realized why an app which does not have a real business reason is so valued by people. Same thing with TSLA, what is so different about this company once legacy carmakers catch up to EV tech - it’s already happening or will happen soon? Everyone says TSLA is more like an energy company now, god knows.

Only junkies go there, heroin junkies , options junkies all the same.
At LEAST 6 months, but usually when people talk about LEAPS, they mean 12 months. There’s no hard rule for how long it has to be before it’s a LEAPS. I usually buy LEAPS with 13+ months, up to 35 months if it’s available. I have LEAPS on SPY and QQQ expiring in Jan 2023
Yeah, according to this sub it was supposed to reach 40 EOY. Daily you'll see multiple posts on this as the best stock of a decade. I'll sell half at previous ATH 33$ since I'll be more than 100% profit.

To the GME bears, if GME is fuk cuz games are “all” online now, why does Amazon, BestBuy, Walmart continue to sell games? Surely, if it’s a dying business, they will slim that part of the operations? 

Now, before you say they sell other stuff other than games, that still doesn’t excuse them for subsidizing loss they are taking on games and optimizing their margins, if they in fact are taking loss - they can still slim their loss. Also, GME doesn’t only sell games either.

Most of us aren’t the long term investors into GME because of fundamentals. Sure, it’s still profitable and has plenty of cash in hand (won’t go bankrupt over the next 2 years). We are here for the squeeze.

I did! I have never seen it written. I obviously hang around people with bigger vocabularies than I have. Thanks for pointing that out. Word of the day.
Hell yeah I do, there are so many situations lately where calls are over priced. Too many people just buy calls without weighing their options.
Why are you buying puts at the bottom of this dip? Should have done this three weeks ago
That doesn't even help. Especially for tax advantaged accounts where I dont have to worry about short term gains. So even with leaps, if like up like 30%, I'll just sell it for sweet profit. Then miss multi-baggers if I just held.
It’s a crying shame 99% of you holders only bought in 3 weeks ago, soo... That doesn’t help much.
Good chance it breaks the 21.30 low again before testing the ATH imho

I was pissed about the offering when I thought it was an immediate offering. Since it’s an option it’s a smart play for the company. They (Game Stop) can cash out on a squeeze beefing up the books as a rainy day fund and funding the new initiatives. It’s not X number of shares so the company cash grab is set the new number of shares in play is the only question when and if they issue. 

TLDR: The offering was a smart play for the company. The shorts are going to pay for the company turn around efforts. 

Edit: Sucks for us because we aren’t the long term share holders that will benefit from it.

No Jimmy! You were supposed to match the color of the stock, it is red, not green. You colorblind retard.
maybe i don't understand this correctly. isn't the whole idea behind interest rates being lower is that it acts as a catalyst for growth and spending and future earnings. if earnings are absurdly high however and most companies cannot grow by debt financing - how does macro elements justify individual stock prices.

I agree with everything you said lol which is why I don’t get why you don’t agree with my point if you risk going at it getting COVID when you had a chance to get a vaccine you shouldn’t deserve an ICU bed. Like you said it’s a 99.8% survival rate anyway it’s not like you’re rolling the dice. 

I’m just annoyed that people are gonna refuse the vaccine but lockdowns will still happen bc hospitals will keep getting filled. Especially at risk people, like how dare you refuse the vaccine and burden us with your healthcare?
I expected politicians to get flack for jumping in line to get it first, but as it turns out some Europeans won't take it *until* their leaders get it.

So not only are you getting vaccinated first, it is politically and socially advantageous to do so. Win-win for European politicians unless you're an anti-vaxxer.

His "Starlink IPO only makes sense when cash flow is predictable" tweet.
you can say that as a reply to any statement in history of human speech.
it's not "lose 85k" per se. it's risking it for a gain.

let's just say you have a 50% chance for 85k to become 400k, or 0. that's good odds statistically because it's 5x gain for 50/50. i think most people here would do it.

but if it was 500k to become 2.5 mil 50/50? probably not, even with good odds.

that's my point.

Have fun with your puts dude. They’ll pay off in the short term. We’re heading down to 21$ and getting a nice bounce. Pltr is a company with technology nobody has it can beat. I wouldn’t bet against them long term
got them bearcats and the points. uga don't wanna be there
Daily stretching, eat breakfast, not get suckered into chasing weeklies. 1-3 month to expiry options nearly always print if you just buy the dip and don't pick garbage companies.

These are shares 😂 he'll be fine. If these were weeklies, THEN I'd be concerned
Bro buy enough to get to 20 please this hurts my eyes
Bulls don’t come to the market next week. It’s gonna be different. Don’t come.
So what ur saying is pltr is safer than bonds?
If I may ask, in which stage of the wheel (CSP or CC) are you in each of these stocks? Are you doing mostly weeklies or 30-45 DTE?
Lol what a joke
Someone calculated not too long ago and it was a bit over $7600 total.

I agree with everyone saying don’t do Robinhood- due a real brokerage that lets you do otc etc. 

I would personally say start with reading financial news every day then as you see companies you use and have faith in start putting some money into them. 

Also in my opinion - and there is a risk ad with any investment-  I would put a little money into certain spacs that have good management teams before they merge like Pershing square and Bridgetown holdings. 

I would stay away from calls and puts and any options until you have enough cash on hand that you ok if you lose 100% of the call or put you are buying 

Sign up for free newsletters, read r/investing and wsb, Benzinga, market watch every day- even when it makes you sick (and it will). 

Good luck and god bless

My Feb 2/15 93c I got for $8.1 average cost. Current price is $8.2. 
My Feb 2/15 100c average cost is $5.47 vs. current price $5.4

Thanks again and looking forward to your ideas.
Still in Moderna and god I’m feeling the pain.
So what's your maximum gain here? 6x if it drops to 50? You're probably right, but look at ZM, the market is irrational as fuck and you're basically gambling here. For me the risk reward relationship is not right here. Hope it's not a significant amount of money for you.

Hahaha exactly... the main lesson learned is to take your gains right before earnings.
We just think that we can spend our money better than the government can. Pretty simple.
If you're holding shares I wouldn't say that. It probably has a couple of runs left in it.
3-12 months depending on education to start being able to make useful stuff for yourself. that’s the most important thing to stay motivated through the tough stuff- have something you are passionate about solving in mind and try to figure out how to solve it.

Damn man, that sucks! I can definitely relate with selling way too early.
Obummercare is garbage. Before I joined my union they wanted to charge me $600/month and they would only offer coverage for “catastrophic events like losing a limb,” and even then only past the first $6,000.

Covid treatments are covered by the government, so if I get it and need to goto the hospital i’m not worried. 99.8% survival rate anyway.
100% agree. Just remember, the markets can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. I’ll watch from the sidelines on this one good luck OP
Why what happened
That’s fine, like I said I’m not getting it. But then you shouldn’t expect a hospital bed if you need it. You’re overwhelming our ICU’s, you took the risk of COVID over the vaccine now lay in your bed you made

Why are my charts frozen today? Wow new year already off to a bad start!
I would agree it’s not big news if they get additional small gov contract similar to previous ones. However your argument is dumb - selling after heavy dip + it is big news if pltr manages to expand successfully in other fields other than gov.

Edit NM all money in GME woot
PLTR option bag holders are fucked. So shareholders how we feel?
the fact that this simple concept is not understood is ridiculous, literally surface level financial understanding
Guess not
Majority start by losing money and learning from mistakes. No one can manage your emotions. How would you feel if you lost 5k overnight. Some have money. Don't care. Some are broke. Until you feel the doom. No tube vid can help you.
Last time I lost over 1k in the market and then immediately got a stimulus check of $1200. Yesterday I lost over $600 and today I already saw the $600 stimi in my bank account. It’s.. it’s like the government is my guardian angel..🥺🥺

I told my mom I wanted to use my profits to start a business and she asked me if I was going to source cheap later from the third world to save money.
This is too cringe even for r/wsb...
Having money doesn’t mean having intelligence necessarily
Keep in mind that GME ran out of consoles and online sales are more prevalent this year, aswell as the recent trend of “sell the news.”

And this is just based off of patterns, I considered getting into GME hard the past few days but didn’t want to light my money on fire so I looked at their charts. If it hits 15/16 again, I will hop in.
In a perfect world, if you refuse the vaccine then contract COVID and need a hospital you should be denied.  

I say this as someone who’s not getting the vaccine. The whole point of lockdowns is “it’ll overwhelm our hospitals”. Imagine staying in lockdowns forever bc some people refused the vaccines but still expect a hospital bed. 

Maybe we can get PLTR to compile who got vaccinated in a huge database lol.
Palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy

SPY is an ETF that will mirror the S&P 500.  QQQ is an ETF that mirrors Nasdaq. Those are both a great place to start.  And if you buy  one of those and it goes down, don’t sell, it will come back.   With shares, that may or may not be true.
There are people here who I don't even find funny, I just think they have serious real life issues and are doing self harm because of their mental illness from these kind of trades.

Dunce Diligence more likely
Start with buying $1000 GME shares and sit tight.

In one-two weeks on WSB you will know more than basics about volatility, due diligence, SPACs, FOMO, long term and short term plays, dark pots, pre- and after-market (and why most of the time you should not suggest yourself about the day just from P-M), gaybears and diamond hands, that there is no rocket withou Ryan Cohen, and that other few important things like stay the F away from options (at least for now) and cherry on the top - big squeeze and who will play you in a movie. Enough for not loosing.

Did I say I'm a internet stranger and you should not trust me and do your own research ? Good. Now go buy those shares.

And the only time we blew past $30 was for the two console cycles, which is where we are at now.

Yes.  Probably wiser to be 100% ETFs, but I’d imagine you’ve probably got your eyes on some shit to gamble on if you’ve landed here.  Maybe more like 90/10 or whatever.

It will probably be the other way around .. I don’t think we’ll do so well over there tbh .
We've all been there. The best you can do right now would be to buy calls on PLTR.
Just sell buddy. It’s not news every time PLTR gets a contract.
?
Big Gov, FDA, Public Health and Big Pharma is the market right now.  People also talking about supply chain optimization.  How the product achieves this is a bit mysterious.  Also not clear if selling it requires an army of consultants.  Perhaps they will need to get Accenture/IBM/Deloitte on board to push this through for wider variety if use cases. And yes some certification programs are needed as well.  Palantir certified Data Scientist in Udacity
Sherman doesn’t scream tech savvy CEO though and image matters a lot for GME currently. You’d hope they have the same end goals but the shelf offering was a bitch move and made it seem he cares about his own ass rather than genuine shareholder value. But we’ll see I’m just generally cynically hopeful and don’t want to get carried away with the hype as I have what is a lot of money (for me) riding on GME haha. I’m sure a lot of others are in the same boat and I think tapering your expectations for ICR is a good idea.

This is a very similar situation to Snowflake whose early lockup lift is this next week, both in float and volume unlocked. Will be interesting to see how my puts do on ❄️ . Page 253 of this filing talks all about the two lock up periods. I don’t recall their date of IPO, when is 90 days past that? Also, I don’t see where you found this 90% release in the early lift, I read 40% on the document. Regardless, I am 🐻 on the company as well as these lockup dates. Will definitely buy puts for the 90 and 180 day mark.

For tax purposes it's better than that even. Say you have $10K in stock and $10K in cash, and you want to give a charity $10K. If you gift the stock, you can then buy new stock with your cash and have a new, presumably higher cost basis. It's not a wash sale because you never sold any stock.

The only stupid angle I see here is that you should have scaled into those puts. You'll have a lot of theta burn, but your sweet spot should be puts right before the lockup ends. Although it will likely drop further as reality sets in that its a shitty business.

Closing down more physical locations to remove overlap and to improve the balance sheet. They are currently running 4 trials on turing the locations into gaming centers, as in a place to go to play dnd, a place to get pc part recommendations. Its the one thing amazon cant offer, a human being to offer help to less informed people. Clueless parents and such. Yes you can easily get digital items at those places, but that is a double-edged sword, one can easily buy digital items anywhere, its a matter of loyalty, incentive, ease. Maybe they improve those?

Yeah 5% is probably pretty fair for S&P though I think it’s highly dependent on the Georgia runoffs/stimulus hopes/etc. As long as we don’t raise interest rates, we’ll probably continue to climb up, but if we don’t get enough stimmy growth could be pretty weak.

I was looking at it’s all time chart yesterday starting at 2002 and the only times it passed the $25 mark was when it shot past it without pullback. Every single time it got close and didn’t make it was followed by a pullback to where it was before the massive run.

You may or may not believe in TA, but GME’s trend points to it hitting $15/$16 again before attempting to run up again.

None of those companies will ever pay a penny in taxes, regardless of what the tax rate is. That 8% will only apply to small and midsized companies, and all of that revenue will be funneled directly to the companies you listed.
I didn't say they would go under, I just don't think there will be some epic lifechanging squeeze for most people, it'll be modest at best because people will keep exiting their positions when they're satisfied with the profits they have.
Good luck with that discipline
Def don’t get sucked into the “gurus” on YouTube etc. that said I’d recommend you focus on shares for a couple months — and then look at selling covered calls and credit spreads — see how risky you’re willing to get, try to double a bit of cash you set aside via premiums you sold and use that as house money for some riskier plays — wsb can def be a source for some plays but make each idea your own

Why you say that
[removed]
I’m referring to the degree of the drop in March and the rate at which we recovered to all time highs just months later
Yeah I don't understand it either. Not only is their businessmodel outdated (who the fuck buys games in a store anymore?), they have already gone up like 300% in a year. Why would now be the time to buy in?
Very poorly
Your old man has 14mm sitting in TQQQ? Right.
There is always a bull run somewhere
I agree with this to a point. With a portfolio of your size, why not stash half into a safe etf so that 2-3 unlucky trades don’t wipe you out.  For instance, what if you were all in on a hot stock and their ceo and founder suddenly died?  For most stocks it would likely just be a blip, but say elon was out of the picture. it’s not inconceivable to think that tsla would utterly collapse.
I mean technically anything can happen with the market but yeah you should know where your realistically at on your position by April if not sooner.
😂

I’d only be concerned if there is a poorly executed Q&A session afterwards. Otherwise this will be a shiny pre-packaged pep rally. They do need to deliver SOMETHING tech related or face public scorn.

As much as people like shitting on Sherman, he is a GameStop outsider brought recently onboard to turn the ship around; not just a toadie promoted from within. RC has a clearer path forward and is pushing for immediate action. Notice he hasn’t called for Sherman’s head, although that could change. RC and Sherman have the same end goals, even if differently motivated.
That’s just Tesla

He is pumping Pinterest now 😂
Does anyone got the feeling GME will start to really run next week? It looks like all the stars seem to be lined up. Perfect/textbook cup and handle starting Dec. 1. RC probably will release another 13D next week, leading up to ICR. Their request to be categorized under tech instead of consumer probably means they have business pivot news coming. And another curious observation is that before the 2007 and 2013 console spike, it all formed base and started mooning around 16 and 20. We are at 18-19 now, which seems to be in the historical range.
That’s why I sold 1/15 CCs at 40. Less premium but no sweat

I believed and still do believe wholeheartedly that ABNB is ridiculously overvalued but I got absolutely raped buying put spreads. I did it initially to mitigate volatility changes since it was right after options opened but thank god I did that instead of short because as bad as it was for me, it would have been infinitely worse with open ended short positions.

Always remember, the market can remain irrational longer than you can remain solvent. People lose their entire life savings trying to short stocks.

Very unpopular opinion I’m sure, but certainly the best advice you’ll get here.  Being a self-proclaimed investor with little to moderate knowledge of markets, you absolutely certainly should not be trading options, which is the vast majority of what you’ll see on this sub.  Buy mostly ETF’s and maybe 20% of your portfolio to buy shares of companies you feel particularly attracted to.  Continue to do that while you read and learn shit.  If you have to ask questions on Reddit about whatever you’re considering putting your money on, you aren’t ready to do it.  If you’re putting money on a move, you need to be the person answering questions about it.   That sounded so fucking good I’m going to copy and paste it so you can read it again.

Hello tax, good-bye debt, hello 🏠 

ZM 4DTE OTM earnings lotto ticket followed by continual losses trying to repeat.  

Was buying otm calls two weeks out and selling to close a few days later.  Mentally exhausting and was 🐻 all through april.  Bought calls in February, puts in March and April.  Took me a while to get on the right side of the market but when I did I kept playing with the goal of not losing anything while still having chips on the table for a lotto to hit.... and one finally did.  Then I got sloppy, I finally decided to buy tsla calls, big time.... on Sept 4th, smh.  That hurt.  Lost more on memes and took another swing for the fences on the next Zm earnings, and lost.  Cashed out.  The more I lost the more I realized how lucky I really was that day.  Life changing event. 

Next year: no more lottos, likely selling covered calls, buying leap debit call spreads.    Although after seeing computer brains post maybe joining theta.  

Played around with futures /MES and /MNQ and learned the importance of entries, currently using 4sma crossing over 9sma, (thanks C-Money) with the trend as entry signals - but for shares and ITM leap calls.
I’m watching the auburn northwestern game and   it blows my mind why any top football player would go to an underarmour school.

The real world version of me thinks companies that don't make money are bad.
To make people believe in the bs. That's it going somewhere. So they can short it. Pltr and Nio is Legit company. Gme is total holiday fomo. Which is the only reason it went up.
Same, sold some naked calls at 170.
It would be a nightmare for the overall market
LEARN TO CODE
There is nowhere else to go is not the best argument in my opinion. Money can move to value stocks and this can be end of this WSB mania. Most earnings will see large drops because of that. Stock market as a general may not tank but most money is not made on dividend stocks.
Look at their stock for the last 5 years. They're cannibalizing themselves to deliver those numbers. Devaluing shares to deliver dividends is bad business, not to mention tax inefficient for shareholders.

I can’t legally advise on what you should do. That is a decision that you will have to make yourself. It really all depends on how much your strike price is on your position and if you think it will realistically get there by May or not. You still have plenty of time on your exps brother so you should not be worried at this point. I used to trade options and ended up losing a shit ton and switched to day trading and swing trading regular stock only and I have been a lot less stressed and profitable long term.

I hear you. I haven't bought into the concept of GME somehow turning the corner either. Great management or not, I just don't see how they plan to grow. All of my games are bought on PSN. Consoles are bought from wherever I find one first. Probably grabbing a controller from Target/Walmart/etc because if I'm out getting a controller, I may as well do some other shoppinf while I'm on the move. I hope you all make your tendies, but being somewhat of a gamer, I just don't see it.

Edit - I understand there's probably some short-term money to be made here, which is the point of wsb, but this is the definition of a meme stock imo and I just can't risk it on something I don't believe in .

PLTR is a pump and dump. Their lockup period is coming up soon so the founders have been trying to pump the stock so they can cash out. Best way to make money is to wait for a day with a big pump and watch the pre-market the following morning (5AM) for a move that pumps it further and buy puts right at open when it starts getting dumped. Honestly though I would just avoid PLTR altogether if you don't know what you're doing. Know that sitting opposite you on each trade is a founder looking to cash out or a Money Manager/Market Maker looking to get a cut of the move as well. Sure you can find a way to make money if you really try, but odds are significantly stacked against you.

Also, mods have been aggressively removing posts that shed light on this scam. So know that they're not your friends on the matter.

I'd say to start with some funds and ETFs and learn what those are. Just because they're something you can jump in on without being too scared, they're generally a tad more stable than individual stocks.
Anyone know where the url is to the post that said they take the top 5 mentioned tickers for a week, then buy calls for those on the upcoming week and sell on Friday is?

No don’t buy every fucking 20 cent drop. That’s not realistic. I specifically did that strategy yesterday and it worked out well for me. I’m a day trader and I don’t like to swing trade typically to avoid losing scenarios like how a lot of other people have experienced trading PLTR in the last week unfortunately.

Anyone with PLTR knows how to hold bags believe me

Robin Hood. SPY calls. YOLO and FOMO. This is the way.
Why do you think it’ll peak at 140?
Typically anywhere from 3-6 months after IPO I can't find anything on DASH specifically. You also need to watch out for premature sell off in anticipation of expo, all of the momentum can be cut up over too long a time period and theta gang wins again. From here until then worst case scenario is they pay some analysts to upgrade it to a buy rating.
It’s at 4:30, just time enough for the WeedMaps gang to get back.
Just buy GME and hold until February and then buy a Lamborghini with your gains🚀🚀🚀🚀

I seriously don't understand the spac hype. Feels like you're using your capital to pay a premium on someone else's capital, when you don't know what it will be. Once you do know what the acquisition will be, it's priced in. 

Separate, real life example. IPOC. Why did it move from 11 to 15 when, the entire time, everyone knew it was merging with clover health and knew the date? What was driving the price fluctuations when the information was known and nothing changed?
Fake news. Chicks who know what they doing buy men's disposable razors
There sre literally thousands of tickers to lose money on. Why pick the one with a lockup expiring soon. See what leaps you can get mid feb
All I see is memes 😂
It's cold but the people seem nice.  Depending on where you go you might need to learn french.
What the fuck is pizza pizza
This sir is an impressive YOLO may the tendies be with you and the diamond hands make you rich 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Nah. Very unreliable.

But I did buy the dip yesterday. If it keeps doing its thing, it will most likely bounce back up next week, only to fall again shortly after.

However there's still a chance of it crossing the 30, and even a slight chance of actually growing, so I wouldn't buy puts.
Is $40 really your exit price?  How did you come up with your price target and I assume that you are not accounting for a short squeeze potential but simply turnaround story?
Wait for a wave of big banks analysts price target raises next week. You will feel betrayed!
And thus began the year of bull, the most bullish year in the history of mankind. Faithful autists and retards ascended into otherworldly realms of tendies, bears were cast into destitution for all eternity
This is the way
If we hit that bullseye, the rest of the dominoes will fall like a house of cards. Checkmate.

Your question is why do you think it will go up?

There’s literally hundreds of posts with mountains of info.

Go clean your room.
Low interest rates does not necessarily justify growth stock's growth - most of them are in the impossible zone. I am not saying the stocks will tank but earnings will be end of meme stocks one by one.
It was at $17.88 in the morning and I tried to buy in. For the next couple of minutes it just kept running up. I tried a few other orders and they weren’t getting filled. Finally did a market order and it went straight down from there.

PLTR is a buy after lockout period ends. Going to be heavy institutional selling once it ends for sure
Interesting. Who knows. I have a feeling this is a combination of big money manipulating the stock, lack of big money entering because of the lock out coming up, and the fact that this stock was attacked by numerous short firms the last month as they try to get a better position. 

I feel like the lockout is priced in and we might trade flat for a few days then launch soon after before the Jan presentation. 

Just my opinion who the fuck knows. But I know im comfortable with my position and will hold shares for a few years. Not giving up my position that easily.
Pretty easy when you hop onto SQQQ in April and ride it all the way through December.

Yea house brand works when you’re much bigger. Like when Costco or Amazon offer their own stuff. At that point, you’re not worried about making sure to sell you’re own stuff because people will choose on their own. Not to mention pc parts get outdated quickly. So it’s more of a risk now than say later on eventually.

I disagree. There’s plenty of room ahead for more equities pumping.

This is also magnified by the quantity of printing done, 70 cents printed in 2020 for every dollar that has existed. https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1 

We should be seeing the vanguard total market index catch up to that same percentage growth (~40-45%) and we are nowhere near that. If anything bond markets are bloated. 

This situation is different from 2000 or 2008, where both of these factors weren’t in effect, especially at the current excessive extent.

Fundamentals only matter when rates increase and your returns have to beat the higher risk free rate. Otherwise you’re just trying to beat zero return.

I was running the wheel on AMD while is was in the 45-55 range. I had a $55c I was selling call my shares away when it ended at $55.07 on that Friday. No biggie, I will just buy it back next week. Stock instantly jumps up to $80 range and the premiums no longer justified the price.
Smart plan! Stay mentally strong and dollar cost average to lower your average share price if you can afford too
I highly disagree that the average joe understands what the market is.
PLTR is like a firework you light but it doesn't explode
All i see is that you are overflowing with money. 💰💰💰💰💰
Selling tsla calls at 100% and watching them go 10k% over the next 2 weeks, and after that being to scared to buy back in....I'm still scared of buying tsla. I literally look at it everyday and say "who tf is buying tsla at $___!?"
These dips hurt, but rest assured, hold your position and it will pay off.
I'm fucking down 0.25% since april. I don't even know how it's possible to be that flat, I took a shitton of risks/options.

Youre right. I dont think its a bad idea but I do think that gamestop has more important things to do right now. When gamestop is on the right track with e-commerce and customer service they might do something like that, but they will probably start with simple stuff like mouse pads.

Hey man like I said. I didn’t give them any advice other than VOO and the basics. They’re grown men and I’m not going to tell them to avoid the stock market. I’ve already told them that they can lose all their money in the blink of an eye with risky positions. They can make their own decisions
Google is also $15,000,900 a share.

Google can’t get info on undocumented immigrants because they’re pooling from their own data. Palantir has a way of pooling through every one else’s data. Google is a whore. So their data isn’t hard to get if you know the right people. 

Plus it’s offering something Google can’t or else these governments wouldn’t have awarded these huge contracts.

It might be that's all he can talk about. As you get older you normally only start talking about work and kids because that's all most of the people's lives are. He might be just trying to reach out to stay friends and doesn't know what else to talk about.

What’s the play that was your biggest regret from 2020?

Uhh, what? 😅
To give a bj to, I thought this was implied. I apologize.
After losing money in pltr gang (but still holding), i am moving to goev gang. I did my dd and i think the product is impressive.

The only thing that worries me is that if spac owners bought it for $10 a few weeks ago, how is buying at a 40% premium a good decision

Are there no margin requirements in cash secured puts? I am following somewhat similar strategy in Indian market but the margin requirements is squeezing the returns.
My options expired yesterday with a 99.89% loss 😎
Do you know when the lock up expo is? 

I played with puts this week and it was just strange how strong that $140ish line held. Luckily I ended up positive on the ticker over the week by trading the spikes up to watch it fall back down and also caught the initial ride down to $140. I closed my position because the stock just doesn’t make sense but I think there is still out opportunity here. It feels like nkla. Puts too early you get crushed but if you bought before the dec lock up expo it was an easy winner
lol i did not. Found the raw video on twitter.
Holiday markets closed
If it moons I take premium plus sell at a strike price I’m happy with then switch back to puts... win win

Man it sucks how friendships fall apart when money starts becoming a more important ascept of life. I'm not rich, but I'm doing alright all things considered. I just got into a business with a partner this past yr and have proceeded to do very well so far. My best friend, who I've known my entire life is extremely well off. His dad left him with numerous businesses in multiple industries. Anyway, we haven't been talking that much since he got into a serious relationship, but the only time he seems to hit me up is when he wants to know how much I did in business. Like he'll text me saying what's up and proceed to ask me what my numbers were. Like wtf.

Suite to taste. Some people like more than 100%, but the strategy kind of breaks down if the stock moons or crashes suddenly. For the same amount of money, I would rather just sell $10p on SPACs. They are a cheap way of making 5-10% per month.

Google does all of this, but way better. Google is already a form of government. Google has an actual division that employs only ex-CIA, ex-NSA, ex-military intelligence etc. Add in ATT, Time Warner, GE, Verizon and all the old school companies and you have a complete circle fuck of data on you. I mean, ATT owns the physical fucking data trunks ffs. 

Palantir is a small player and owns literally nothing, they aren’t the gateway for data, they just sort other people’s data and make likely predictions.

TLDR: Google and Att etc. are big dick daddy government, not Palantir.

I have heard a lot of talk here and there about the rise of steel, companies like have been MT specifically mentioned, among other mining stocks. With that being said, I just stumbled across IVAPF or Ivanhoe mines. I do not hold a position but would love to here you guys opinion on the stock after a little DD.

"Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. engages in the exploration, development, and recovery of minerals and precious metals located primarily in Africa. It explores for platinum, palladium, nickel, copper, gold, rhodium, zinc, germanium, and lead deposits. The company's projects include the Platreef project located in the Northern Limb of South Africa's Bushveld Complex; the Kipushi project located on the DRC's Copperbelt; and the Kamoa-Kakula project located within the Central African Copperbelt. It also holds a 100% interest in the Western Foreland exploration project covering an area of approximately 2,550 square kilometers located in the Democratic Republic of Congo. It has a strategic partnership agreement with China Nonferrous Metal Mining (Group) Co., Ltd. to examine exploration, development, and acquisition of mineral projects, as well as production, smelting, and logistics opportunities in Africa. The company was formerly known as Ivanplats Limited and changed its name to Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. in August 2013. Ivanhoe Mines Ltd. was incorporated in 1993 and is headquartered in Vancouver, Canada."
For real lol.  If anything there are slight pullbacks on stuff like FCEL that you can buy but certainly ain't dipping
Not that ive done so, but in my opinion 100$ to 1000$ or 10K to 100K and so on is the same thing. Just with much higher risk depending on how much is on the table.

Twitter needs adult supervision. It is the best value in social media space since it cannot get it's act together and slowly turning to MySpace. Why would a company harass POTUS who is doing free advertising for them and bringing people on board? Why let OnlyFans steal their  traffic?

2. JD.Com fuckin moons immediately after the news of BABA's dick slapping and their marketplace opens up to many many many large volume retailers that weren't able to access their marketplace prior to antitrust. 

3. China wraps up investigation and allows Ma's IPO to go forward then BABA booms and climbs like a cracked out Mountain climber sponsored by Red Bull.

It's if you own more than 10% of a company's shares, you're considered an "insider" and have to amend your 13D filing within 2 business days of to show any new purchases or sales. Cohen went from 9.8% to 12.9% ownership a week ago which drove some big buying. Notably, as an insider, Cohen can't take any short term profit from stock moves (to prevent big money from doing pump and dumps). Idk what the exact rules are but think theres a 6 mo time frame - he's now in it to win it.

I may be wrong on this, but I think the price increase will rip up until the 7th and it'll then fizzle out after. This is great LT choice. But if you're in for a quick profit, which I am, two weeks out would do the trick. 250 C 1/15 x 10

Yea The great robinhooders you can pick up a copy on Robinhood.net
Probably a pretty good trade if you can get solid premium. Even the lowest ratings I have seen put PLTR at $20. You are basically suggesting a one-of wheel strategy, but I prefer a far more stable stock to play the wheel with. Something with like 60-100% IV on the options.

>not realistic and quite manipulated

Stock opens trading 3 months ago at $10(which is management's hand-picked price, they would have priced it higher if they thought their own company was worth more. It wasn't an IPO, so management directly picked that price).

Price stays around $10 for a month.

Then it rockets to 32 in 3 weeks on no new information. WSB says: "Totally normal, great stock! PLTR is the future!"

Takes a breather back down to 23, WSB: "This is not realistic and quite manipulated."

If you think PLTR was manipulated when it took a small 30% drawdown, and not manipulated when it more than tripled in a month, well, you belong on WSB.

Yeah, the market isn't going to just crash and stay dead but those V shape recoveries aren't from retailers. V shape bounces from crashes aside, we're seeing V shape bounces from even the slightest dips. My theory is we (retailers) are being conditioned to buy the dips.

Make us think every dip is followed by a hard bounce enough time and we'll believe we're in charge and toss more money into each dip. I saw the same thing happen toward the end of 2019. 

I was literally buying calls whenever a new ATH was made just as an experiment and was making money but it just didn't feel right. 

Fortunately, I had a sizeable short position leading up to the crash. Didn't think it would crash that much though, otherwise, I would've made so much more.

But I'm just guessing.

I drive by almost daily, and sometimes through the back parking lot. They have large totes full of food sitting outside that just go to waste. I've seen them full of food like potatoes just sitting for days. That's just what I've seen. What I've heard is that the guy in charge is an overpaid asshole (not my words) who would rather rely on volunteers than to hire the necessary employees to run the place. 

They do get a ton of volunteers though, if you ever drive by the back you will probably see 20-50 people in safety vests packaging food under a canopy and in the parking lot. Im all for food banks but from what I've heard the money is very poorly managed and in most cases used to line the pockets of the higher ups.

Hey tards someone throw me a snek 🐍
I don’t think the current price drop has anything to do with lockout. Weak hands are taking profits. Volume is low. Big traders left the market to spend time with their families or are at the beach snorting coke off strippers. Any institutions trading it have already rebalanced their portfolios for end of year.

I think we have a better than even chance of 2-3 point price recovery next week. I don’t see price continuing to drop.

Buying puts on VIX is weird because the value of volatility is baked into the options price. As VIX lowers, the puts in VIX become less valuable due to Vega. It is not recommended.

Calls on VIX are great when they work because you are both getting the delta increase and Vega increase. If you look at my post history, I used to aggressively daytrade VXX.

I wasn’t saying tsla is a good stock, I was pointing out annual growth doesn’t mean shit. My point still stands that the DIPS and PEAKS of spy and LITERALLY ANY commodity you can find are similar. I did not imply spy was the BEST investment choice of the year.
Why would it tank? Catalyst pls
13D is when a person buys more than 5% of a company right? Were the recent buys that big?
I doubt they will throw actual $ at it. Suspect that some of their tech will be used to analyze track and car metrics collected, possibly even data on competing teams.
You’re playing spy. The answer is obvious
You spelled the stock ticker wrong, pretty sure its: "$GME🚀🚀🚀"
The last 2 days have been wild but watch out for that quick reversal 
I expect a Cramer pump here this week along with some analysts PT’s north of $30
It’s literally free money lol. The $600 that appeared in my bank account this morning isn’t going to break me.
Then wonder where your money went. Amd call broker for a refund

Problem is I'm looking for a US fund that tracks the $ASX
If all the GME and PLTR can go somewhere else and jack off to future infinity squeezes that would be great

I'm just trying to demonstrate the difficulty by removing the code and trying to think logically around rules you could impose, and how they'd have unintended side effects.
You can actively opt in and out of IBKR’s lending program. The most important thing is to know if there’s a contested proxy it will require the shares to be held unlent or recalled by the record date to have voting rights.

Before amazon was a global conglomerate empire they were an online bookstore.  Doordash is already flirting with picking up orders at Walgreens, pets Mart and others. So long term play is if you want anything delivered to your house in 2 days shop Amazon, if you want anything delivered in 20 min shop DoorDash
Love the game. I could just swing around for a good hour
How did you do that? What’s stocks?
Got back into nio about 2 weeks ago and now you retards start hyping it, gonna have to sell it now.

100% this. I’ve blown up my account before aiming for the moon even when I was up $3000-4000 a play cause after weeks of break even or small losses, I wanted to finally hit that Jack pot. 

Then I started back at $500 and ran it up to $13,000 by taking those 8-10% gains every day. Then guess what? Had a play I was all in, didn’t sell when I was up big, and lost it. But guess what? I was down from $6000 to $3000, but still up from $500 in two months. But I didn’t feel any satisfaction.

After a couple more months I reevaluated my motivation for trading, and also looked at where I was most successful. I was ALWAYS making good entries, and was up 5, 10 or even 20%, but never sold because I was trying to moon.

Once I finally broke out of that pattern, I got good. Up 60% this month. I’ve taken 5-8% returns every day and it’s fucking worked.

another market crash will be necessitated by something not already foreseen. it won't be a worsening global economy, or anything to do with the rona - that's been completely baked in. the thing that brings this market down isn't known. it's exactly analogous to a game of musical chairs...what's shutting the music off? who knows

My first dabble into options—up about 35%-40% (RH does a terrible job of tracking it after you withdraw)

Up 48% on my shares, so would have made more money.

Learned a few things and I’ll do better this year or lose it all.
I made this mini DD which is really just a review of their most recent video to come out but people keep focusing on their big 7 person vehicle and don't realize they have 1 skateboard tech design that works for last mile delivery, RV, food truck, minivan, pickup truck, sedan and sports car. Aka they build 1 thing and can sell it to multiple segments AND they are the only EV company to have revenue (Hyundai) and 50 crash tests completed.

Oh agreed, we won’t ever have asmuch power as them - look at how heavily manipulated stocks like PLTR are. However, I would be surprised if every crash / correction isn’t followed by a V-shaped recovery in the future.

It's why the income limits on the stimmy checks makes sense.  

If you already make more than you save, odds are the extra $600 is going into savings/investments which have much less of an economic stimulus effect than someone who will go out and spend it on something.

They are in expansion mode, that’s why they are losing money every quarter.  Amazon did the exact same thing. They lost money almost every year for 15 years while they were in expansion mode. Doordash is moving to all the smaller towns. I live in Western Kentucky and they opened up in Paducah (the biggest city in west Kentucky) last year. Then Murray, KY (small college town) a few months ago and now they are opening in Benton, Paris, mayfield(all the smaller cities in the rural counties).  They are spending all their money are expanding and giving first time orders free deliveries as well as marketing campaigns. Trust me whenever DD locks down the majority of the country they’ll turn the profit button on and be just like Amazon is today.

Like that scene in billions where Bobby Axlerods pizza guy refuses to box his pizza to go because he doesn’t want it to tarnish his rep by not being experienced at its best.

Thanks for article. And from other things I found it seems that IBM failed to compete because they were too competitive. Not only the buybacks, but there were expensive ventures by buying up large cloud companies that made no money of consequence. They actually started losing when they missed the PC train. And recently, yes they've been spending fortunes on competitive business practices while only spending enough on science to keep their products relevant... While the other guy was following the Edison model of the business of science (money obtained from the last patent funds the next invention).

[It hasn't](https://cdn.statcdn.com/Infographic/images/normal/22924.jpeg). But the massive rate decreases, QE, and stimulus injections worldwide have mostly counterbalanced the drop in GDP and it's expected to keep bouncing back specifically because the recession was artificial (to prevent covid spread) rather than structural (business conditions weakening).

Could Tesla stock holders sue Elon for the IP in SpaceX and the boring company since he may have possibly developed them while working at Tesla?
I know it’s popular but I hate selling weeklies on volatile tickers because you can’t make any money selling 20% OTM and selling 10% the risk/reward for me isn’t there. Selling calls is not really a hedge either. If the bottom falls out your feb calls all expire worthless. The pennies you collected selling calls won’t make up for this loss. You could try buying weekly puts but they are probably expensive and will eat all your profit. To protect against a market correction you could buy weekly OTM puts on SPY or IWM. But that doesn’t protect you if ARKG takes a shit but the rest of the market is fine.

I would just turn all your positions into spreads. Tell me what you paid for your feb 90c and 100c and I can give you some ideas.

They don’t have the cashflow to fund those acquisitions, after the SolarCity debacle Musk has been hesitant to vertically integrate. 

I like their current strategy, pump every extra dollar to build more giga factories with the most efficient manufacturing of any modern company. Most auto manufacturers have a warehouse efficiency of 0.3% per cubic meter. Musk has stated he’s aiming for 100 Giga factories all above 30% efficiency per cubic meter which is 100x the current industry average.

I also see Tesla hitting 1T by the end of the this year, and I won’t be surprised if happens sooner.

It'll be cool once it's really set up and working. We'll refresh the market caps automatically once a week, set up an event post so everyone can enjoy the ceremony and knows what tickers are now good/bad, and we won't have to update automod anymore.

Right now I'm still trying to find a free market data api that has up to date market caps. It seems like every API only updates market cap data for certain tickers reliably.

Small restaurants and their on the street sales team of would-be advertising sellers was (is??) huge stream.   In April they canned large majority of these sellers and we know what is going on with restaurants.   Their attempts at delivery integration or in-app ordering was flaky at best.  Too many other biz doing it better.  So much foodie content, but they’re not in restaurants now to provide content. I know I’m missing something but this thing rose from ~18 in April to $32 now.  Not seeing the value in this company but also not trying to pretend to know the technicals well enough.  Simply don’t see where it’s revenue is now.  Assume current bump is on vaccination feel good.  Not on sales.

Tesla will hit $1000 post split (~1T cap).  My analysis is based on 800K deliveries in 2021. Crazy China sales (we love China mmmkay).   Renewed interest in Cybertruck (probably won't look exactly like prototype bc of federal motor safety standards).  Renewed interest in Tesla Roadster in 2022.  Tesla needs to acquire charging stations (Blink)  or buy lithium companies outright (like Livent).  Not a farfetch assumption.  I think Tesla needs to start acquiring companies on top of vertical growth.

Plus new money is going to be created this year, probably a couple times and there's already strong arguments for continuing lockdowns after the vaccine.

My personal manhattan project to fight spam and organize what tickers are talked about on the sub involves having all 8k or so tickers that we care about in a database and looking for/tracking mentions of each one in text and pictures.

Unfortunately that means if the OCR (picture -> text reading) algo is having a bad day it may misread your pic as containing text it doesn't, or it'll get it right but you're actually using a common phrase like IPO and not talking about $IPO.

If it whacks you for a phrase we haven't noticed is actually a common word just pls pm me and I'll take care of it. We already got a lot of the obvious ones like ATH, IPO, etc, but y'know, always more.

in general stocks with high IV give better premiums, sell 1 CC for every 100 shares you own, set a strike price above your average purchase price and be aware that the closer to ITM you sell the better are the premiums, but also the chances of being assigned.

That's all i have becasue i'm new to this myself, so thetagang is surely a better place to ask suggestions!

I don’t think it should even be this close.
The thesis I trade with is that big money does not want to be caught bagholding in the situation where 80% of the available shares dump into the market when lockup ends.

Right now I believe their plan is to extract call premium from retards by trading the price up and down in the 20-30 range, dropping the price at weeks end to minimize their losses on those calls.

Close to lockup end, they will short the shit outta the stock to entice as much selling as possible, and then buy a fuckton of cheap shares. Once you see the narrative change on boomer news networks, that’s when we’ll see some rockets.

Positions:
Shares, April 21 $30 and Jan 22 $50 calls. Just closed a Feb 21 $35 short call position written against the April calls. Considering opening a put position to set up another hedge.
Astute observation. 

In fact one of the core tenets of momo trading is to screen for stocks that have broken 52 week highs perhaps coupled with positive sentiment/news. 

Stocks showing strength are likely to keep going up. Cut losers and buy winners. Best advice is to know when to sell and not to hold on to losers. When the direction of the wind changes you change too...or die.

Investing is of course very different from trading.

With covered calls you can't go negative unless you buy back the option at a higher premium, not really worth it if you are already selling calls decently over your average purchase price (in my opinion). When/if assigned you can start selling cash secured puts with the money you just made from being assigned, at a strike you are comfortable buying in again, and then go back to selling covered calls.

The only risk here is if the "price you are comfortable buying in again" turns out to be still quite high, and the stock keeps dumping to very low levels (-20% or more you re-entry price); at that point you might be forced to sell far OTM CCs for peanuts to go above your new average purchase price, or risk it  in the name of decent premiums and go with a strike below it.

Tl;dr Stocks only go up. Bears retarded.
Do you still live with your parents?
The longer prices remain up the better adjusted margins will be and the more contracts will be fulfilled at those higher rates.  There doesn't look to be any short term solutions that would drive these prices down in a significant way before mid/late 2021.  If buyers continue to hold orders for a price drop that never comes, the market will be in a situation where they will be unable to procure the product they need at the time they need it.  This would translate to service centers only taking max bid orders vs minimums, or charging incredible premiums on lower bid orders.  It would cause an exponential rise in margins that are completely detached from raw material/steel prices, and simply down to the allocation of a finished product.  Without the allocation issue, the steel market will most likely see a rise simply due to elongated price increases, and the winners of that scenario would be whoever was not over leveraged in low cost contracts and had to eat increased prices.

I'm bullish in steel, thus my current position.  However I have a much smaller position in $MT and a much larger position in $X due to the adjustments $X took early in the year.

FELLAS LETS GET READY TO OWN ROBLOX COINBASE AND ROBINHOOD
> There is another contrast that comes to mind. When the going is good and new issues are readily salable, stock offerings of no quality at all make their appearance. They quickly find buyers; their prices are often bid up enthusiastically right after issuance to levels in relation to assets and earnings that would put IBM, Xerox, and Polaroid to shame. Wall Street takes this madness in its stride, with no overt efforts by anyone to call a halt before the inevitable collapse in prices. (The SEC can’t do much more than insist on disclosure of information, about which the speculative public couldn’t care less, or announce investigations and usually mild punitive actions of various sorts after the letter of the law has been clearly broken.) When many of these minuscule but grossly inflated enterprises disappear from view, or nearly so, it is all taken philosophically enough as “part of the game.” Everybody swears off such inexcusable extravagances—until next time.
They’re censoring misinformation by Trump on Twitter. Not on FB but from what I understand that’s still a cesspool of lies on all sides. More likely they make enough “donations” to be left alone.

You don't have to vote. But it would be unlikely that shareholders would choose not to vote on such an enormous issue. We are talking about a change in control and a substantial shift to the business model. I would think that even the passive funds would recall for a vote such as this.

SEDG will likely drop after next earnings, but will make up the drop quickly, like last time. I expect them to struggle to meet guidance for Q1 and Q2 before getting back on track again.

That's not to say SEDG isn't worth buying now, of course. Just expect a little more turbulence compared to ENPH.

Death and destruction most likely. The next 2 weeks are turbulent. 
1) Dems win both seats gain majority. Higher taxes probable market panic and a sell off. But a bigger stimulus and direct payments so possibly retailers see a bump. Energy massive pump aka TAN or even better JKS to the stratosphere. Legal weed MJ to moon. 
2) Republicans retain control of senate. No stimulus but divided government. MJ and TAN who have been up almost a 100% in anticipation of dem senate have a massive selloff the rest of the market climbs slowly up and continues 3-4% higher for the month. BBY goes to 88 likely holds and have a slow climb up. 

Any scenario, volatility will skyrocket for the next week. Buy uvxy calls to hedge your long positions. BBY play in this is almost certainly dead but the last I checked these call spreads are going for $3-$4 with max profit at $997. Low risk high reward but hedge with a $90 strike put if we go to $103 on BBY next week.

Yeah 750 is kinda standard for new credit. Like when you turn 18 here 700-750 is what you have until you start establishing credit card history and other loans. Youll be facing low limits for a while. In the meantime open a secure credit card w a credit union or somethin. Best way to start in my opinion.
So far what's your favorite
No, lockup is part of a SEC regulation, so the expiration date is just poor timing frankly.

There is a post on WSB today about a guy who has been holding his TSLA shares for 7 years. I bet we'll see that same shit for PLTR in 7 years. Don't sell shares, just buy every time the price dips. I'll post my PLTR loss or gain porn in 7 years.

Everywhere I've read about it, it was 80% lockup. Can you give a source on the former employee expirations? Is that saying that some of the 80% are already being allowed to sell  due to their stock options expiring before March?

Really though, what’s our exit strategy ? Rocket until it blows up ? What’s a realistic exit price ?
one thing i do on weekends if i'm really damn bored is i go look at  options i wanna buy, usually ones that aren't as obvious, like some mid cap companies with high strikes and far dates that might moon. i just queue up a limit order slightly below the  fridays price and if it fills great if not then whatever.
I have 35c feb & march calls ( account for 90% of port & already down 50% )

Like this entire sub has literally seen the same scenario play out with every other meme stock, yet continues to make the same plays and bitch about it
how did u spell "I" wrong
the lines really dont matter, its the spirit behind the wedge. 3 pushes up/down. Most trends start before the current trend (whether bear trend or TR trend) is over.

Saying that, if OP is lucky he might get a retest of the high but thats a lot of selling pressure, any reversal up will probably be minor. 

need more info on the next few bars coming up to really get a better idea since its at a 50% PB. Time for bears to reduce risk and start buying back their shorts

I don't think you understand. If Cohen nominates individuals to replace the current board so he has a controlling position, shareholders will have to vote. Only way to vote is to recall your shares. It's not just Cohen recalling, it's every single shareholder. 

Don't confuse this scenario with KBIO. They are not alike. That was about a single shareholder recalling.

The monthly minimum payments are lower than credit cards. That's the one benefit, but the Alipay app will occasionally switch your default payment from bank account to "micro loan". If you insist on using your bank account, it'll offer a small discount ~3% if you take a micro loan. Even if you set the maximum microloan limit to 100USD, it'll sometimes automatically raise the limit. Eventually one day, you'll take the 3% discount or just forget to check what the default payment is in the app and they'll get you.
I have new balances and they’re okay.

DoorDash had a 324 million net loss reported in September 2020. Palantir has a 500 million profit. 

Since you seem to be on the slow side, I'll put it to you like this: would you rather have a lemonade stand that you have to pay customers money to drink your lemonade, or a stand where your customers pay you to drink your lemonade? Hint: DoorDash is that first lemonade stand.

Make sure you understand the difference between revenue and profit/loss before going on the internet calling people tards, you fucking tard.
What pieces you like the most? I don’t think their shirts are worth it
Depends what you’re holding? If it’s shares it’s not worth stressing about long term. The reason people are crying about PLTR is because they missed the run from right before earnings when it was $11 a share. They Fomo’d back in after it reached $20. It’ll be come back eventually. It’ll be interesting to see what happens after the lockup period is over

Right? These simps think that businesses will just "leave" at the drop of a hat. Sure, they may have to devote more resources to funnel money elsewhere to reduce their tax bill, but it doesn't really affect their bottom line much. Businesses threatening to leave the U.S. over "tax hikes" is simply just political theatre and empty threats at the end of the day.

GME gang is still AT WAR with 🌈🐻
I could remind you all in every comment section that it’s just a money shuffling arbitrage machine. There is no value in the stock market. When you sell stock there is someone on the other end who gives you their money for it. IT HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH THE ECONOMY.

It’s a zero sum. That’s why snap and all brands that everyone knows are up regardless of financials because the average joe doesn’t know Toronto steel industries inc they rather buy shares of snap which they use.

It’s like trading 100 million pieces of the color yellow. We could literally trade colors instead of companies it’s the same mechanic just money being shuffled between buyers and sellers

Now my question would you rather invest in the color calcitegrey or blue?
Full lahorie
This is the confirmation bias I needed 😂
Wouldn’t play weeklies. I have a feeling the people spamming the “imminent short squeeze,” are the ones selling the +10% OTM weeklies.

Lmao fucking Reddit never disappoints
Sure you did buddy. Good for you!
Everybody was acting like lock-up expiration experts, similar to now. People throwing retard amounts at FD OTM puts. I think they fell 5 percent in a week after expo before they began their trajectory to bone town. ALSO it is important to note the week that they fell was during the march drop and obviously was followed by stay at home orders that boosted home fitness sales.

I bought at 14, at 18, at 30, then at 28, at 26 and 24. Need to buy at 22, 20 and 16. Reason: minor OCD.
I hope it does - id like to open another batch of bull put spreads around 12.  It's to high right now to get decent premium
And in a future like that this stock price is justified. I’m trading the inevitable deflation of price when they have a single misstep and you see doubt creep into that narrative.
It’s not stuck. Think of it like a fermenting bread that with time brings on a complex flavor.

80% is off and you’re forgetting that a large number of former employee shares expire before that date. No date extension has been approved yet

BTW If im correct Tesla has lost less money last 4 years than $SNAP. And they have real cars on the road, giga factories, software and a worldwide supercharger network. You must be pretty soft in the head to lose more money on some filters and AR glasses. Just to put things into perspective.

Holding leveraged etfs for 7 years? Oh lawd.
Hell yeah thanks haha. Not a huge fan of Nike. I did like the fly knits I had 5 or 6 years ago but once I switched to ultra boost I haven’t really worn anything else. The arch in them are pretty nice too. I was gonna check out the vapor fly knits but I’m gonna take your word.

> So they are going to make 40x the current number of factories?

Wow. That's really dumb. Did you want to rewrite this and try again?

Just fyi, since you have no idea what is happening around you at all, if you can replace 150 steps in manufacturing with one step and build the bulk of a car in three parts you're going to produce more vehicles. Just fyi.

And that ignores the huge gains in floor space from eliminating drying ovens from their factories -- so expect each factory to massively increase output. And then look at the sheer fucking size of the Austin plant. Look at some drone footage on youtube. Then shit your pants when reality hits you.

omg did PLTR really drop 6% yesterday wtf...

worst week on record for PLTR
rofl bad move
It would be 41% and only if you make over $1million
Wtf? That's a single dip reversal flip on any meme stock
So hold till the wheels fall of ?

I did this when I was 17. She seduced me while I took her round the back of my parents shop for a joint. We were banging for 9 months. Her husband would come into the shop as would her kids who were a few years younger than me. It was awkward but I kept hitting it 😀
She’s a keeper bro lol
Snap is not contingent on Snapchat. They’re currently the tech leading company in AR. They’re currently testing their spectacles with said AR technology at sports venues like baseball so you have the scoreboard like if watching TV and can link it to phone to overlay whatever info you want. Yeah it’s just filters right now but it could explode. Even Apple started patent filing for AR, is it a future worry yes but Snap has 3-4 years head start. Spectacles might not even need the smartphone because they could be connected to 5g and rely on cloud processing. A lot of ifs but it’s priced in. It’s a tech company. It’s not door dash which is literally a delivery service, nothing innovative unless they acquire drone company and develop the technology to beat amazon to market.
When I was first getting into trading and found this page, I got Warren Buffett mixed up with Jimmy Buffett and I thought "wow this guy is partying up in margaritaville, he must really know what the fuck is going on!" Now I realized that wasn't the case...

No shit cars won’t be their biggest source of revenue, hence why the stock is trading more than all its competitors combined. That’s why if had a market cap I’d like the 6th largest company in the US. 

The common theme I see with TSLA mega bulls is they think they see a future that no one else can, but of course everyone sees the potential which is why stock is at these levels. The question is has of gotten ahead of itself? I think yes. 

TSLA bulls are so arrogant and defensive because deep down when you attack TSLA you’re almost attacking their religion. It’s trading on “faith” right mod more than anything.
Poors need their game crack, need every dollar back from games because they work at Wendy’s, and can’t wait 2 days for amazon to deliver. Plus they can’t afford the cost of digital.
This is exactly right. Congress did not go out and fuck the MBS market out of a years worth of interest. It will be due, it’s just not capitalized. 

Also, banks never got good at special servicing. They will likely fuck up the termination of your forbearance. The free money is not worth the hassle on the back end.

When do you see PlTR hitting 40?
What is your post earnings target?
Big Data Hands 🤜🤛
What’s your post earnings target?
I’m primarily a day trader on stock only. The market has been so damn volatile for the last several months so I try to not stay in positions for too long to avoid getting broke the fuck off. I never said that I successfully dollar cost averaged $29.74 all the way down to it’s current price. That was actually my first time day trading PLTR and on that specific day I was fucking terrified bc I saw my position fucking free fall and at one point I was down almost 11 K for the day on my PLTR position. Thankfully it bounced back that day and I was able to get the fuck out of my position entirely to avoid further downside risk exposure. If I did not escape that position PLTR ended up free falling down to the $22 per share range and a lot of people lost everything. I’ve been exclusively day trading PLTR for the last week as it has been dropping and been just doing quick day trade scalps and playing off the volume. Yesterday I had no idea that it was going to dip as hard as it did but having many experiences trading PLTR I knew something was off so that is why I aggressively played the defense and implemented my dollar cost average strategy. Also, it is important to know that I have over 25 K in my account so I am not limited on day trades and I also have enough leverage where I can buy up to 3,000 shares of PLTR at a time if I really need to leverage down to dollar cost average on my positions if things are going south. And if you actually have a fucking problem with me giving everyone practical and useful advise unlike all the other PLTR posts that mislead people every fucking day that tomorrow PLTR will fucking moon when it actually keeps dumping then you can go fuck yourself.
Retards
Don’t listen to them, the boosts are exponentially more comfortable than the vaporwave, a pair I also own. vaporwave is a great shoe but it’s not even on the same wave as boost by a mile in terms of comfort
I just wasn’t sure if the 380s boost was ultra boost or the same boost as the nmds (which im not a fan of). Haha I used to have plantars fasciitis until I started wearing these a couple years ago.
how many of us are fuk if this goes shit downhill?

It looked like Biden would go after FB & GOOG. I’m not sure they’ll be broken up (only Standard Oil & AT&T were), but FB will certainly get regulated to hell if the Dems win the Senate.

Not a single soul here gives a fuck about a few years. Cashing out in a few months, and GME will moon by then.
It depends if they are paying his rent
Yeah, that's why I mentioned that even despite that, WSB has enough retards to make the needle move.
Finished up 15%. Lost basically everything because I was doing iron condors on TSLA right before the crazy run and couldn’t unwind them easily. I clawed my way back with PLTR and selling calls on it then reinvesting in more shares. I’m going to continue this strategy all year or until I hit 1,000 shares
Eurorack modular.... at least then you can make noise while you watch your trends dive
TOS?
LOL I'm talking about the covered calls, MORON. You sell a OTM covered call for $1.00 and suddenly it's worth $11.00. 

No one cares about stock gains. Only thing that matters is you fucked up by selling a covered call that get bulldozed.
So they are going to make 40x the current number of factories?

You're delusional lol
own a pair both, I don’t see a difference tbh but they’re both extremely comfortable. I just picked up the 380 as my first Yeezy pair and I didn’t regret it, as soon as I had them on feet I knew I was keeping them. 

just pick up what you like you won’t be disappointed in either

This guy is a genius. He made me rethink my valuation model of $TSLA! My new bull thesis is that elon is going to build a hyperloop to the mars but only tesla cars can enter it. Therefore every household on earth will be forced to buy a tesla with fsd add-on. Cpnservative estimate would be 1bn cars sold to humanity with 10k earned per car, adding up to 10tr in profit. Put a forward P/E of 50 on it and we are seeing a 500 trillion dollar opportunity right in front of our autistic eyes.
Depends on if you're doing naked or covered calls (naked calls are a gambler's play, covered calls is a Theta gang play). But I'd recommend you look up a "how to" for whatever trading platform you're using.
So true. I bought a stock a few weeks back that I’m holding until at least February, yet I watched it slowly fall and stay in the red for all of December. Idk why I care about that when I didn’t buy it for December, I bought it for the January returns

u know those memes during that weekend pltr was like 28 ish? there were so many memes, motivational, lord of the rings, gladiator. got me pumped. i already knew pltr was overbought yet i still bought in pltr at the top and lost 2k.

i would say fuck you guys for losing me money but the meme quality was so good imma say worth.
Plz tweet this to Mr. Musk

You've come to the wrong place.
Nice try SEC
Now that’s a smart move.
To all the people saying the market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent:

I normally agree with that sentiment, but if you look at the stock’s history there’s only been 2 or 3 green days the past month. Every article being published by the press either talks about the ipo pop or how doordash shares seems dangerously high.

There is no cult of followers like Tesla or PLTR, only MMs making 5000 share buys to keep the price stable so they can destroy the short term put holders. Once the lockup ends and the float is no longer 20M they won’t be doing that.

Me waiting for ARKG to go up: 🧓🏻💀⚰️🪦
I will watch this. I think it's a great first play because you will either get assigned shares of PLTR at the bottom or you'll capture the value of the most expensive current put contract. Since this is a one year challenge I think it would be interesting to add another rule being that you can only trade on 3 WSB meme stocks that show up this year(1. Its slightly more challenging and requires you to think ahead on your own for your next pick and 2. It really might help you avoid blowing this all up in the 11th hour.)

In case you can't read, that means that someone went and deleted all the adjudication logs for this year, but not for any other year. I hope you can understand why people are rightfully suspicious when something as absolutely ridiculous as this gets swept under the rug.

Thing is, they don’t even have to dump their shares day lockup ends. It’s usually the fear of them dumping their shares that causes a dip before lock up. You can see this with FUBO,LMND,SNOW. They all preemptively dump a few days before lock up, get a sympathy bounce and usually resume the dump. I’m just gonna wait it out and try to time it.
It literally is profits that a company makes that it distributes to the shareholders
Your calls are fucked.
They just cancelled their dividend last year why would they bring it back they still hemorrhaging money
Just wait til next week when stimmys boost us to the frickin moon
I know you degenerates will gamble away your stimmy. What are you betting on?
I'm not. You're a bunch of fucking losers.
Never used margin before but really want to buy a few hundred shares of something on margin and sell CC. Is that a pretty safe strategy?
Have you ever thought about the reasoning behind the so called "genocide"? If it at all exists in large scales and is targeted at Muslims, why only certain Muslim groups? What is the selection criteria? Is it just random people in the streets getting locked up? What is the end goal here?

Nice gains. 

But yeah. Something I’ve learned. Never bother listening to foids. She didn’t want what was best for you. She wanted what was bets for her. She wanted you to do that. 

If you’ve got the brains, and can do the research, you can make some nice money even just half assed trading, in sectors you understand. Travel industry. Mining and industrials are a bit harder as price movements usually relate to business deals vs predicting non insider events. 
Tech. Pharma.
If you know about these industries, all you need then for consistent gains is a solid understanding of the market, and finance. 

Now most people lose money, because frankly most people are retarded. An iq of 100, whilst stastistically average, if you see what they’re capable of, it’s pretty retarded. 
But trading appears lucrative to people with iq’s of 105-115. The above average fish. 
And the education system etc, and our culture of “encouragement” and “giving confidence to children” creates these overconfident idiots who think they are geniuses, and financial Mozart’s. Because they could get 90%’s in high school, so they can dominate trading. 

They usually lose money. 
Like one of my good friends. Smart guy. But he’s unaware his opinions are not original or formed from a synthesis of data, vs just feelings. Eg I gave him financial advice. Safe financial advice. Park your savings in a travel agency now, and by October, November you will have doubled your savings this year. 

But the groupthink logic, I.e Normie mass public logic was, corona has destroyed travel industries, and they’re worthless.

Ironically the exact reason to park your money in them. 
They’re low overheads. Specific ones have fantastic cash flow, and debt facilities. They will survive corona. 
Your downside risk is very very low, and your possible benefits are very large. 
And because Normies have valued these companies so low, you can bank on their ignorance. 

Most normies can’t read financial documents. Most normies struggle to understand an income statement, and balance sheet. Let alone reading them in conjunction with a cash flow, and then the added notes pertaining, like the board getting access to a higher debt cap. 

All most of them look at is, “oh my god, stock is up. I should have bought. Maybe I’ll buy now” 
They’re bandwagoners. They don’t predict. 

And worst of all. They don’t understand probabilities. 

Eg let’s say your friend says, let’s not put our money in an index (Normie investment) I don’t want to risk my money investing. 
And then your index fund goes down in value, (rare, but it happens) and your friend then goes, I told you so. 

You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take. 
Normies love to play it safe. They usually hate risk. They like sure things. 

And girls. Girls are the same. Girls love property investment. Often the shittiest form of investment unless you’re a property developer and know how to flip properties for low cost. If you can’t do that, then property is fucking terrible. 
Unless of course you want to vote to bring in more immigrants to artificially increase the housing market.

So I'm actually in the monthlies and leaps for a high growth ETF (ARKG). I'm hedging against 1) the market going to shit and 2) Genomics taking a shit, or going sideways. 

I'm in 90cs for Feb and 100cs for Feb. So maybe my play is to sell 115cs or around there weekly? I also have some longer dated ones, for July that are far OTM. And for Dec that are far OTM. But even for those, there are higher strikes available. So perhasp selling at 10-20% above those strikes weekly after feb?
STAHP
Right, but I could also be wrong and it goes flat or down a bit. Then I'm out 100% of my principle.

Why would you buy Affirm. It's the opposite of a becky stock
rip you got duped
They sell before actual merger.
wow you had 33k as of yesterday? so you actually only lost 60% of it coming into 12/31 then went all in on tsla 700c WHICH ENDED up printing. funniest part is tesla was over 700 for the majority of the day, more than 703 which meant you got so 'lucky' you literally sold the bottom. hi was 719 so those contracts would have been 19 or 6x. luck goes both ways i suppose.
Real tendiemakers use a toilet as their chair and buy NET instead of that useless Herman Miller. Why would you even need one chair to sit, another one to sit *and* take a dump? This is so inefficient.

Isn't he friends with 🥭

Bought 5k worth of TSLA FDs, TSLA proceeds to tank and I get margin called, TSLA then rallies the next 3 days. 😣😵😭
The spiking nature of VXX/UVXY is all about trying to capture the upward by basically purchasing retarded 0.01 OTM FD contracts in large quantity and selling the moment they are showing a profit and then purchasing monthly puts for the inevitable drop. The part I don't like about buying the puts though is that the IV drops in tandem with it.
Thought that was for people in Florida....

Real or not, Separating those who believe in you from those who don't is detrimental to your personal growth. If someone makes you feel negative or unconfident, or says you can't accomplish something just because they think they can't... run away from them as fast as you can. Find people who accept you and have done what you are trying to do.

Erm, no. Fiscal spending by growing deficits is bad.for the economy as public debt crowds out private credit expansion which is how US economy grows. Of course, tax cuts that increase.the deficit are also bad long term. 

I think Democrats willingness to increase taxes and thus keep the deficit in check has been the least bad option economically. But increasingly both parties.are bad in regards to the deficit.

I’ve still not heard a good reason as to why people think GameStop is going to turn itself around. Physical game sales have declined very sharply and selling computer parts is already covered by many major retailers. They have nothing new to offer. Are they going to launch a shitty third party platform to rival Steam, Epic, etc.? That won’t end well. Epic survived solely on Fortnite money until their store started getting more traction.
They make a Sierra 1500 with a 3L diesel now? That’s sick. I had a 2016 Denali with the 6.2L but I sold it and lost all the money on options (I drive a work Chevy full time)
Also kind of a covid stonk, even tho roku is blowing up, no doubt. But covid def tipped scales in its favor

Heavily invested. Predict a trading range for the year @ 550-900 as FSD is recognized as only thing anyone can buy that works and adds on average another 6k per car revenue. 

Model Y goes worldwide. I’ve got one and the value proposition is undeniably great.  I can buy any car I want, and you can’t have my Tesla’s.  Wouldn’t trade them for anything. 

If Tesla is a cult, then it’s like coffee and chocolates are cults.  They are simply great and that’s all it is.  

So my trading plan is holding but selling puts about 90 days out when it falls.
Nope.  A lot of times they run up to merger, and then dump a bit after the merger actually takes place. QS price action isnt common
Even the weekend dow is closed today 😑

$UVXY 12C 2/19. Locked and loaded. Reporting for duty.
I see them used the wrong way round a lot lol
If you are bullish on QQQ this year you and you are looking for 100% profit then you could simply open a bull call spread on QQQ. For example, at close yesterday a jan 2022 315/335c was selling for 9.63. Your breakeven would be 324. So as long as QQQ ends the year up about 3.5% you don’t lose money. If QQQ ends the year up just 7% you hit max profit of $1,037. You risk $963 (+ fees) to make $1,037.

If you think 7% is pussy shit you can go further OTM. For example, 380/400 would cost $332 with max profit $1,668 for a potential 500% gain. Betting on another 30% year for QQQ is a much riskier strategy. BUT compare that to TQQQ where QQQ would probably have to move 40% for you to get a 100% gain and it starts to look pretty good.

I would buy mostly close to the money with the idea that I could buy back the short leg if/when we get a market correction. That way I can take profit on the pullback and uncap my upside. This completely changes the risk profile so run the numbers for yourself before doing this.

Fast forward 3 years, she pulls in 90k, I pull 120k, and our biggest arguments are around what the fuck we are having for dinner. I told her a year ago I wanted to move to Scotland and she paused then said "OK, fuck it." She has a strong "we need to build up our shit, fuck everyone else" mentality and its worked out great.

Healthcare/health insurance, specifically, doesn't work in a capitalist system because the standard economic model of supply and demand doesn't apply, demand is always infinite 

For example, if you wanted a candy bar, would you pay $1.00 for your favorite candy bar? Probably. Would you pay $500.00 for that candy bar? No, definitely not. 

For example, if you need to buy insulin to survive, how much would you pay for insulin? Whatever it takes. How much would you pay to get life saving medicine for your wife, son, daughter? Whatever amount it takes. People go bankrupt just so their loved ones can live a few extra years. That allows the capitalistic market to continuously inflate prices, making it harder for lower-middle class people to afford it.

Some things make sense to socialize, in fact we socialize many things already: roads, k-12 education, the military, police, garbage collection, etc. I think it's time the richest country in the history of the human race provides basic health services for it's people.

Keep in mind this retard managed to not lose his cool over 7 months of bear ass-raping TSLA down to $185 in June of 2019. I was margin called more than once and had to sell stock and rotate it to calls to keep the upside potential in tact.

Will Tesla be worth more 5-7 years from now? Yes.  
Will Tesla be worth more 9 months from now? Probably not.  
Will Tesla be worth more 1 year from now? Maybe.  

I was bullish from the time of the supercharger announcement in September 2012 until June and the only reason I sold in June was because of the stupid pandemic. If not for that I would've held this climb as well. Nothing goes up forever though.
i didnt buy leaps in March cz i was too retarded finishing my degree and writing papers on Rhodesia and Seal 🦭 Hunting . Fast forward 9 months and i have no job😌i only have stonks

80% of the shares are locked up until March after the initial IPO. These are shares owned by PLTR leadership and can be sold 3 days after they report earnings. They can also be held if the owners have big plans and think the value will go much higher, nobody knows.

I think the likely scenario is we have a dip right beforehand due to people being afraid of a selloff, but I don't picture the owners actually selling their shares all at once.

I am not a financial advisor and don't know what the hell will happen. I have lost a lot of money on PLTR this last month.
Hey quit disrespecting women they’re slowly taking over men’s sports
Early 30s. that makes sense. It's hard for me to think that far ahead in the future when I'm used to losing money on TSLA weeklies.

BBY is all profit taking now. The CEO trashes the company on earnings calls and they have pulled forward all their sales due to pandemic, anybody who wanted a TV bought one. I rode this shit down with a small position from 119 to 105 and got out.
Buy QQQ and forget about it, literally can't go tits up.
Thanks brother! Stay patient and don’t panic sell your position if it keeps dropping. And most importantly DO NOT use all your margin (if this is even applicable to you) to dollar cost average down on your position so that way you do not have to worry about ever getting hit by a margin call.

Which stocks are going to $0 in 2021?
You’re probably right actually.. I was using the term boomers as a general derogatory term for people who don’t know how to make money faster than in 30 years..
Started 2020 with a -5% portfolio return, then March happened and I went all the way down to -75% (I don't come from money and this was my entire life savings). I was legit depressed and borderline suicidal for a couple of months, it was rough folks. Thankfully, I ended the year +28% up! It's not WSB hall of fame return but I am damn grateful for it and I feel like the most blessed man alive. 

Don't chase hype and meme stocks, spend more time with your family and friends, and appreciate the little blessing in life and most importantly, BE KIND. If I can claw my way back, so can you. 

Happy 2021 folks.
It’s just a popular meme of a dude sitting/standing waiting. It might be from a show but idk to be honest
History shows it doesn’t matter really based on party. Obama admin actually printed better than Trump did at like 14-15% return. If dems win, printer will go insane and spending will go up so it’ll just benefit equities

Doubt it. And even if they did some of the more moderates like Joe Manchin are not voting the party line
Thank you 🙏
If you think Democrats taking the senate will be bad for the market, look back throughout history. During years of tax hikes on capital gains and corporations, the S&P 500 saw significantly higher average returns. This is partly because they are offset by positive fiscal spending and economic stimulation.

2. Heavy competition and lack of innovation. Instagram already has the shitty filters. 
3. Youth is moving on. Yeah it was a hit a for a few years. But the kids just moved on to TikTok. There is no loyalty
4. Even if the kids would stay on the platform, how the fuck are advertisers going to earn money? The few bucks allowance they get, they will happily blow it on something else. Its not facebook where advertisers earn money from boomers scrolling through their feed.

And the company is valued at $70B +

Lmao. As long as that $8,050 is being spent to consistently lower your dollar cost average on your PLTR position (if you are currently upside down) then awesome! You probably should also consider diversifying your monetary contributions into other stock with great long term potential as well if you are not doing so already.

What looks expensive today will be incredibly cheap down the road looking back when a company has a bright long-term future like this one. Buy on dips, accumulate shares, and hold for 2-5 years.

Honestly IDK how many boomers are on board w/ PLTR.
They want to know what the company does and trying to explain it to them is like when I tried to explain Yahoo in the 90's.
2022 way OTM calls for ARKK and ARKG might be too obvious for their own good
Copy that.  I'm not on IBKR but I think the move is declining to loan them. Do you have that option?  /u/Uberkikz11 might have some insight.
This is the way.

Mmm modest gains +33%. No options, all shares.
Gonna try options this year.
[March till now](https://i.imgur.com/zlGudQO.jpg)

This whole year has been good. Got %7 raise at work with another 4k in Feb if i meet objectives. $900 bonus. Have amazing fun job. Not rich..yet, but happy none the less.
Life's good. Miss traveling tho.
I bought it at 15. I am thankful to buy PLTR.

Edit: Just saw the multiple posts regularly and Yolo. Got lucky to enter early. 

This is my first stock buy in life, glad I didn't get rekt.
What strike
ICLN is jacked up with meme stocks that’ll likely send the index down over the next few years. Same with QQQJ. I’d recommend both but maybe just do QQQ and start loading into those once they start dipping
Yeah, I’m actually doing pretty well so far up about 50 to 60 percent. I got 13 dollar CLF for March and April and 14 dollar jun(bought at 12) .And 22 and 25 dollar MT July bought before the jump (22 dollar). I made the mistake of buying Options on X at the peak(I sold it). And I have a 20 vale July (bought at 16.50 )that I’m not too sure about. Like I said, I’ve made some mistakes. My strategy is basically be as risk adverse as possible by buy companies and positions I think will make it regardless, and then hope for the steel market to go nuts.. But the problem is a lot of people on this sub just buying stupid shit
☝️
Imagine making $0 by not being invested in the market.

Also did you know that throughout history, during years of tax hikes on capital gains and corporations, the S&P 500 saw significantly higher average returns.

Wow you got a great setup. Stay patient my friend
Buy rh gold, use another 2k in margin. AMZN weeklies Monday morning
Hey guys my asshole is always itchy. I might have the worlds itchiest asshole. Doesn’t matter how meticulously I wipe. Do I have hemorrhoids?    Am I gay?
U would too if u bought baba, bidu, or pdd last week
It would have to fucking rocket within a week. It is not just about if the value technically goes up. You probably wont find anyone who will buy them from you.
I've seen it in 2 and couldn't tell what the can was, could've been anything from what I saw. I had no idea until this post.

Again $SAM is not going to get behind this to promote it guaranteed.
They will sell a shit more Twisted Teas, it’s just a fact.
Holy shit I didn’t even know they were public lmao. This just gave me a bear boner

Doubt these will print my friend, going long is the move on $PLTR
Not going to lie, I don't always sleep well at night. There was a great red period for SPACs a few months back that really did a number on my anxiety.

However gains have made up for it and I could handle a pretty big hit without margin call now even after this last red week.

Best of luck to us both with T H C B, timing the exit is still the most important part and that is yet to come. :)
You lost me at "rational", but I'm all in

The whole Medicare for All is a delusional move. Nothing to do with Socialism. The main problem in the US is the medical system. You go to a doctor, you are not given an estimate. You sign your obligation to pay whatever. After a month or do, you start getting bills that you must pay. 

What other system requires you to pay without knowing the price upfront? Pharma corporations can raise their prices by %1,000 and no issues there. We already pay more than anywhere else in the world. 

People are so uneducated, they were directed to blame the insurance companies. Insurance companies do not like to pay for obfuscated pricing schemes. Hospitals CEOs get paid millions while running a “nonprofit”. 

As to the government just paying for these crooked system, it will bankrupt it. Anybody who’s been to a doctor knows this. So, let’s just have the taxpayers cover all this. What’s another 15% on payroll?

Can we get some actual pltr dd in here so I know what the companies actually worth and when to buy calls... thanks
Yep for sure. Those stochastic studies play perfectly in this market and couldn’t possibly go below the level at which was circled. All - in $BABA
For looking at things? Yes.

Haha but there is with capital gains. Imagine making 100k this year and paying half of it in taxes.
This is one of the worst plays I've ever seen.

GME! In 3 months you’ll have triple that amount
Hahaha what a joke.  Maybe it’s like buying blockbuster video at 3.19. Definitely a lot of money to be made on that stock but the company is flawed and will never be good,  hence why they are closing stores left and right and the digital age is destroying physical games.
Nope, not in this case. It's basically a free pass for a year. It's all in the CARES Act. I have my own business, so I was able to do this, the PPP and EIDL loans, plus the stimulus checks. I saw it as a once in a lifetime opportunity to borrow at the lowest rates and in the most favorable conditions we'll ever see.
Oh most definitely. But it will be short lived obviously. Then we’ll be back to skyscraper green dildos the following week.

Because PCR can only detect active virus (so anything between infection to 10-15 days after). So if these cases self reported symptoms that occured more than two weeks ago then you can’t use PCR to confirm. You could do an antibody test but that won’t tell you if it was due to infection or due to vaccine
Yep. The institutions are waiting for all the retarded calls to expire worthless before hopping aboard witj more shares. Same thing happened to Vale.

I’m not sure man. I get the same feeling for Palantir as I do other large cap stocks. I’ve used their system lightly in the army. It is something to behold, seriously.  That surge of liquidity may send it down but I don’t think by that much. Of course this is my opinion. I realistically think $50-$60 by 2023 would be fair. That would be a nice profit. On top of selling calls along the way.
Don't worry, grandma will give you a $100 birthday money next year so you can try again.

I don’t know why people keep suggesting Subway. Ackman clearly stated he wanted a mature unicorn and Subway is not a unicorn unless you strap a footlong to your head. Ackman has also express his fondness of Musk and even tried to recruit him and Tesla to go to one of Ackman’s holdings planned communities in NV or TX. I’ve linked one of Ackman’s tweets to Musk. Two months later PSTH was formed and six months later Musk announces he is moving to Texas. 

I dont know the legality of it, so pure speculation, but what if Musk is the large secretive buyer that has been gobbling up shares of PSTH?  [Ackman Tweets Musk](https://twitter.com/billackman/status/1263546537268989952?s=21)

They usually have the 990s of nonprofits and you can see how they spend money donated to them/executive salary/ect. Ensures the money you donate is actually going to a good cause and not some persons fat paycheck.

Once saw a small "nonprofit" whose mission was providing fresh fruits/vegitables to food banks, got like 300k in donations and paid the founder 200k a year and turns out they barely did shit for their mission.

Buy calls before 2024 election.

Buy calls during any event that may include volatility or uncertainty because the market will find a bullish outcome out of it anyway.

Buy calls during any holiday with low volume for the last two hours of trading.
You don’t need volume at all for a stock to move

I agree door dash is junk but shorting anything in this coming market is going to be very scary. SleepyJoe is taking over this month and will push multiple huge stimulus deals and jpow may push interest rates into negative territory. The USD currency will gradually fall so this will cause assets like stocks priced in USD to increase. So $80 will be a tuff target to reach imo.

My experience has been that companies are looking for one software platform for all of their departments instead of loosely connected systems. I work for a $50 billion health tech company that just went all in on Salesforce in 2020. Salesforce is now used across every department of my company and replaced multiple software platforms including SAP. Salesforce is now used in customer dispatching and management, installation databases, sales, revenue, pricing quoting, building reports for regulatory agencies, etc.

4 week out expiry? You kidding me?? 

This is WSB not Wall Street Hospice
Yup.  Now take out a cash advance on your credit card to YOLO on a weekly to make enough money to pay off your taxes from last year.  You'll find out a way to get into massive debt from a gain.  You just aren't trying hard enough.
I'm not expanding my position because there isn't a DA or binding LOI yet but tbh it's probably the right move if you have the risk tolerance. I invested close to NAV and I'm buying on margin so for me I need that assurance before I go any deeper.

Banning, by banishment!!
When I think I got it bad someone is always worse off great advice though
Yeah for sure. Options however are risk/reward than stocks.

If you aren't having luck with shorter term plays maybe buy some LEAPs on runners that have good 2021 ahead of them and just use them as huge leverage for a long position.

Other than that stocks are good man. You can sell options instead of buying them which reduces the risk substantially.
[deleted]
What are you hedging against? A single stock taking a shit or the market taking a shit? I’m confident that my stocks are stable as long as the market doesn’t shit the bed. So I buy weekly OTM puts on an index fund. Yesterday I picked up 10% OTM 1/8 puts on IWM for my hedge. 

On high IV stocks I just do bull call spreads like dogcorleone suggested. For example, I bought 10 jan 2022 NIO 45c/80c spreads a month ago. I bought the 45c for just under $18 per contract and sold the 80c for $11 per contract. My downside risk is under $7,000. Max profit is $28,000 and breakeven is 52. There is no reason to further fund Thetagang by hedging this position because my downside is minimal and it’s a potential 400% gang.
I hope it’s your asscheeks so u can sell on Grindr and make passive income
Heads up. Will only say this once on Jan 1st. Sell everything before July 4th. Government will disclose alien invasion the prior week.

Green energy is the future
There’s a good chance that PLTR has a good couple first weeks of January along with the rest of the market, cuckboy PLTR bag holders take it as proof that they were right all along and double down with more stupid OTM calls, and inevitably get cucked all over again 

Stop playing PLTR unless you hate money. There are so many better/safer plays, also there are much better upside plays if you really feel like gambling.
So many half days and off days... My local casinos are still closed too, I can already feel the shakes coming

Yeah I usually sell Deltas 0.25-0.4 for a 2-4 week option, I try to sell at or below recurring support levels. IV 50-120, anything over 120 is a hot potato, some of which can make you money but some will burn you.

I bought the AMZN and TSLA call butterflies Wed night. Once TSLA hit 717 on Thurs and moment slowed down I bought the put butterfly with the goal of having it land between the 695 and 700 short strikes. 

When I say lotto plays it isn’t necessarily when I enter them, it’s how narrow the wings are and the risk vs reward. These were very narrow wings so a small chance of profit but they were sill extremely cheap - between 20-60 bucks per butterfly.

Regarding trend: I use an indicator called Voodoo Lines by Simpler Trading (note: I’m not employed by them or anything, I just find them to be credible in what they put out). It’s all technical analysis and Fibonacci stuff put into an indicator so you don’t have to run levels yourself. I saw 700 as a major level of resistance in Tesla based off that and built my flies on that.

For AMZN, it’s general trend is a gap up on Monday and a heavy sell of on Friday. It’s almost like clockwork for it. So I use max pain on swaggystocks to see where the most amount of options will expire worthless and structure it around there. AMZN was at like 3240, I had my short strike at 3250 because it normally doesn’t dip all the way down to it’s max pain level, just close

I think TAN goes a little sideways for a bit, it's pretty overbought atm. I'm still adding to my position slowly but I think we get a week or so of consolidation before a huge run into inauguration day.

That said, Enphase getting added to SP500 is a big deal and JKS is oversold right now so maybe it does moon anyway.

Who kept selling to keep the price falling, then? And according to google they spent near 6 billion in R&D in 2019 alone.

First trading day of the year will be some tax effect thing where people sell and don't have to pay taxes for 16 months on the gains. So it will be red, but just ignore the noise and buy the dip.

Nice. I use 9 and 20 EMA for scalps and day trading. For swings I go to 50 and 200EMA. RSI and MACD for all time frames. You’re definitely doing well and keep it up.

I delivered for a similar program and I’ll tell you it’s eye opening. I grew up very poor but what I’ve witnessed with these programs was wild. Most of the families we served were living in old homes passed down to them but family had either moved or died. They don’t have a mortgage to worry about, but the home is a 100 year old shack, with no insulation. 

Typically single parents, poorly educated and barely scraping by. 

Bringing them food for Christmas Holiday means they get a semblance of what a normal Christmas is like, with turkey, and pie and such. The toys are things the kids would otherwise never get, and they are truly grateful. It helps them believe in Santa and have a normal childhood to break the cycle.
Ok to short, as long as you own corresponding calls, which some of these short sellers did, so this data is off, hopefully

What is your price target and exit strategy?  Did you already buy? Might be a bumpy road leading to March if that’s when you think the drop begins. So, waiting until feb to buy those and more contracts at a cheaper price with $87K is another strategy if you’re confident in your DD

Agree, that's why i'm only in with shares. But i also think the current price is not realistic and quite manipulated, so once MMs get their share(s) at a low price in February ($21?) it's not inplausible to see bursts of growth like we saw in November. That's probably when i'll stop selling OTM CCs to switch into long dated options or leaps.
That being said, shares for this company are 100% a sure bet, especially at this price.

Imagine not knowing JPow just had the BlackRock team sell and used the money for the $600 checks. You then just put the money back in the market. That's why it's flat.
But that's how we operate here
Sad! But also just jealous everyone’s getting free money.
Yeah I sell calls expiring weekly. so for example in TSLA if your leap is 600c and you sell weekly 700c, and TSLA hits close to 700 by friday, just close your entire position for a net profit, your leap will have a higher delta till the price of TSLA is below 700. once it starts shooting up even higher, the weekly will outpace the leap. 

this is why it's a fine line about what you think the stock can move in a week to maximize theta gains. one way is to wait till monday to see where the price opens, rather than sell the call the previous friday and keep guessing all weekend if that's the right strike u sold. see what works!

Just buy puts
DIVIDENT
Okay. What kind of IV, Delta etc. Do you look for?

So far I've been screening high IV (>50) and Delta ~30 for anything within 14 days expiry.
Tesla is going to be a status icon in Asian countries especially in India, where people more like to show off more, and given it’s an American brand (more trust in manufacturer). I only see Tesla to fly higher. Only regret not buying it around $400. This year trucks and cyber trucks might also be announced. So hoping Tesla will triple it’s stock before other EVs can catch up. Citron can short how much ever they want without actually posting their positions is like monkeys trying to give advice to humans.
Did you buy at $131?
Got my 600 stimulus check, not even enough to buy a TESLA share post split. Must be intentional. Don’t want the peasants to get rich.

man i preejacked on so many good calls this year because i do this. oh it moved 10% in any direction? better cash out! then it moons
First year investing as a student with no income. Got just over +7.5% with some pretty safe long term shit. Started playing with options a couple days ago though, so I should be broke in no time. 🍾🎊🎁
Buy high, expire worthless.
They sold 280m shares at $8.73 and priced their IPO at $102? ...That seems illegal and when the dump happens that its Armageddon and all us retards, degenerates and autists are all alseep at the wheel? I bet they call you chicken little too bubbleboy
HUYA was one of my early options and I didn’t know much about spreads but it was right around $18 and I had a $20 call.  I sold a $19 covered call on my 4 contracts not knowing what I was doing.   I kept til expiration and it ended at $18.40 or something.  My call expired and for some reason my covered call was exercised.  
Margin called in the morning for 400 shares but got the cash from the cc and I waited until it dropped to like $18.15 and bought them.  Lucked out on my fuck up but still learned a lesson.

I think it’ll start inching up a little next week, with cmc earnings next week,but only a few percent. Wouldn’t expect anything huge from it until after 1 or 2 positive steel earnings though (unless cmc knocks It out of the park, and makes a crazy guidance). If stld and x have earnings, and if its down/sideways I’m GTFO. My advice is not to go all in just on one steel stock,You should look into CLF (it’s at ATH right now get it on a dip) its been good to me so far
I’m suprised so many do ...

I hope you're right. Lock-up expo might get dumped by ground floor investors but many employees could have vesting contracts that extend much longer/only allow a certain number of shares sold in a year. There are a lot of things to prevent a massive sell off at expo. I think no matter what DASH is heading down, might just short it instead of buying puts so I only have margin interest to worry about instead of context expiry.
Anyone can drink OCSP, not everyone can or will drink twisted tea.

Thanks for that explanation. Maybe that is the way for me then. Are those OTM calls you sell at closer expirys than the ones you bought? 
Also how do you exit those? For example, if the price shoots way up and sudenly they're all in the money, won't you be on the hook in some way, and that could wipe out your profits from the options you bought? 

Really appreciate the help by the way.

You scalp pretty good. What indicators do you use?
for a high IV ticker like Tesla for example, I can make back more than 50% of my call's cost by selling OTM calls even 10% higher strike. with puts I have to sit and watch the stock and decide whether/when to sell it blah blah. This method is a bit easier personally.

Also, if the stock just sits and does nothing, puts and calls both lose money, but OTM calls would net profit

You're just jealous cause his RH account is up more than yours.
That could be the play tbh. I'm also in the 350cs and was thinkng its so far out of the money. But then again I have so much time on my hands for this one. I find it hard to believe it wont recover to at least 300 in the next year, and that should be enough to make a decent profit on this even if I'm in the 350cs.

Why is it better to sell further OTM covered calls vs. buying puts? 
And yes it is actually a good long term play, and not a pump and dump, but lots of volatility making me sweat. 

For example it lost like 10% in the past week and since i'm in monthlies and leaps that really hurt. But if I had weekly puts I couldve made money on those while still keeping my long exposure.

He said in 2020 they increased sales by 50-100percent in quarter 2 because of corona.  So those sales comps will be hard to beat.  He's bearish on the 6 month time horizon. But not in the next 3-6 months... Be Careful with May Puts. I would wait until after they after have Q1 Earnings.  and short 4 or 5 months out.

you are talking about longer terms calls? then sell further OTM covered calls and not buy puts. this is assuming your stock is not a pump and dump and actually stable
You aren't wrong but I think I should point out that looking at EOY tax-selling season volume isn't a good idea. It generally isn't indicative of actual liquidity of the stock.

Other than that I agree with your thesis but I won't be joining you in your short position as I think the market is fucking retarded and doesn't do anything logical and it's too logical for this to go down.

>There’s a difference between education and intelligence. Have you seen the guy fight? He fights like it’s a chess match and always makes the most effective adjustments during fights.

He's certainly one of the best ever but his fights have pretty much same strategy: drop guard, keep distance, use the ropes as defense, just wait till opponent throws off weight and balance, go in for explosive attack  holding back a little, back off, repeat. Basically a more offensive minded rope-a-dope. He does good cover for both defensive and offensive points just in case it goes to decision, but will try 75% of his ability to get refs stoppage.

Like I said he's one of the very best at what he does and his strategies fucking work, but he's usually not seen as a multi tool fighter

And once SpaceX goes public we know it will balloon like Tesla. Private companies can't be inflated by Robinhood schmucks.
Basically you have to have 100 shares to sell a call right ? So instead you short the stock ,which would award the buyer the right to buy 100 shares , and than buy a put position lower than the short position   ,earning the credit price from the call sold  .. and as the stock lowers you make money and your break even is upward of the short price by the amount you got paid from the call sell . Your gains are pretty solid as long as the stock doesnt have a dramatic hike in its price . That's where losses happen . As the sell gets lower you make money from the person who bought the call from you and you start to make money on your put , with the maximum amount to make is whatever it takes to get to 0 , where as the loses are unknowable . 

Edit: I fixed where I got confused , like I said  just learned about it .

It will go down for a while, then it will go back up. It go massively overbought by retail investors that didn't understand what was happening or that it had already gone up by the time they got in. i.e FOMO'd and left with bags.
I'm still holding my Baba calls. But those are leaps, for June 2022 so I've got time on my side.
ive been averaging down on $240s. My butthole is clenched too
It’s literally the last week of the year, so many people taking gains, balancing portfolios, ect.  Everything that isn’t based on solid financials took a hit, spacs, meme stonks, ect.  The best of the best will get pumped hard  this week, note that NIO closed green all week and PSTH had a rally at the end of the week.  Money is flowing where big money expects a pop, PLTR will recover next week but don’t expect a huge pump for a few weeks, good time to buy long options or shares.  There is absolutely no reason that AI should be valued higher than PLTR, it will get there after big money gets their blood.  Just don’t make it your blood.  Stay away from FD’s.
I've actually been waiting for it to dip to this level. Boudda go balls deep on PLTR
This is me right. Dnt know what I was thinking. Did it for the meme. Lord of the ring. And the meme video was good.  It's like I paid for the meme. Cost me a car money.  Would have had a better chance in GME
People here saying next time the market crashes, I'll be ready. When in fact everyone is "ready" that prevents a crash from happening...
Why don't you do it now then retard? Cuz you can't

Yes but generally not per-merger and risk if further reduced for SPACs with good mgmt teams and a reputable target.

Usually post-merger some serious dumping can occur due to PIPE and warrants. Don't hold through merger unless you understand the risks, take the momentum trade and sell pre-merger for profit.

I intend to hold some of my position through merger by this is an educated risk for me based on my knowledge/connection to the space. (Have friends here in medical tourism in Thailand, lots of inside scoop on this company and Allergan).

That’s probably less than what he gets in daily interest on his 0.00001% low interest checking acct
My $30 covered calls are sweating.  I want those shares damnit.
This isn't exactly the WSB prescription for options success but imagine a mindset shift next year of taking profits more often and preserving my capital more aggressively.

20% gains per trade. As often as you can. Ill take more if it seems likely but especially at market opens just fucking taking profit.

Theres unrealistic math that shows that with just 1000 bucks in like 45 trades someone could grow to a cool million. Assuming you suffer 0 setbacks. Again, unrealistic. But if your staying mobile, you can avoid days like yesterday.

This mindset of focusing on probability of profits 📈 rather than hunting for the one big play is more sustainable for me personally. FOMOIng into memes sometimes works but holy shit can it blow you up. Just look at most WSB meme stocks past their prime.

This will require more patience but I think will be far less stressful because ill be focusing on more boring shit in 2021.

Brent Saunders lead Allergan to $68B aquisition and will be taking over as CEO of Hydrafacial after the merger is complete with intent to use this as a platform company for further acquisitions.

For those that don't know of Allergan they developed Botox and are a big fucking deal in the beauty space, thus Brent Saunders is a big fucking deal by extension and universally loved by big name investors. Also personal friend to Cramer so hoping our favourite autist gets up to pump for us soon.

I will probably trim my position pre-merger but I do actually plan to hold this long term,

with this TSLA news of 80k preorders on price reduction, NIO and XPEV are probably cucked in the short term. Though I don't see how reducing margins helps TSLA either.

Good analysis. Do you think it will crash or just a correction?
Doubt the car making business will ever be that profitable. If they are ever going to grow to anywhere near the valuation, it will be due to selling software on their platform. Like over the wire upgrades, media, FSD, etc.

Congratulations on your incoming child! Parenthood is where it's at. Fair warning, those first few months are going to be hell due to lack of sleep. Just know that whatever you're feeling goes double for the mother. Take care of yourself, but, more importantly, make sure your gal is taken care of. Postpartum depression is a scary thing. You'll be able to get up with your baby throughout the night but she won't be able to delegate feeding until she can pump enough milk. That burden is her own and she'll need all the help she can get.

Prepare for a newfound motivation though; dad life is great. Spend time shopping around for 529s and see if contributions are deductible through your state income tax as well.

Glad I didn’t buy CHL after all the BS articles on some stock sites recommending it.
Palantir is creating an ERP Suite for their Foundry software as they alluded to that on their last earnings call. I suspect Palantir is going to take a chunk of the pie in the coming years. A lot of older , multi national companies will switch to Palantir software because it’s arguably one of the best, if not the best, at taking large data sets of unstructured and structured data and giving an individual a holistic view of everything within their company. 

Palantir also working on some cutting edge stuff with their Vertex aspect of foundry. Vertex is where a company can run simulations on stuff so that they can see how a decision will impact the rest of the company. BP is using this and it in turned saved their company over $57M in two weeks.

I fail to see how doordash is worth 45 billion when palantir is only worth 41 billion so you're probably right. Remember though, being early is the same as being wrong.
why donate 200 when i can donate 400 after i become a billionaire? not donating now is better for them in the long run.

Our worthless Congress should pass a law that the market has to be open 5 days a week, without exception.  They can let it run electronically when need be.

Adjusting for split, Tesla already passed Amazon, $3,500 compared to $3,200 now

Like a year ago, Tesla was at $400 and Amazon at $1,900.
If you keep averaging down you can't lose.
Never knew there was such a strong correlation between PLTR bag holders and mediocre wanna be power lifters. But it all makes sense now.
Yes. 100000% > 48%. But you missed the point, smarty pants.
Yup.

My money’s on Etsy
Started year down 53K all time. Bought shares all year and two weeks ago made enough to recover two years worth of losses (33K). Unfortunately I decided to hold and things went down and I started buying options every dip to recover faster.

As of today I’m now at +13K for year (after being up 33K) and holding 50% shares and 50% May and October calls.

I’m hoping with a strong push in January I can back to +33K or maybe even all time if my stuff moons.

Also with the price in low 11s atm this it the time to get in, max downside is 10% (NAV is $10).

Expecting to hit around $15, it's not going to shoot as high as the EV SPACs but it actually might be worth holding through merger (unlike hyped EV SPACs).

I've detailed elsewhere why this is a good play. My position is 8000 commons, plan to expand to 10000 commons shortly and maybe add some warrants.

So many half days and off days..... My local casinos are still closed too, I can already feel the shakes coming on

Yeah, but the fed is back stopping the market, which makes the conventional (and sensible) wisdom of an impending correction difficult to visualize. 

Bubble popping events like Trump refusing to leave the white house or a war or something similar seem to be necessary for a major correction. 

Are you expecting a 10 percent correction or something bigger?

Salesforce is the Google of their industry, their industry being providing a suite of useful tools and services to help business with managing their clients, leads, customers, employees, etc.  Very dangerous to short. They are a strong business and will be going up long term.  Slack will end up looking like a smart purchase, just like Tableau.  It has strong synergy with what they do. Buying Slack just bought Salesforce a ton of new sales leads, forget the software itself (which is used still by many businesses, it is very sticky).

My New Year's resolution is to listen to Tesla while driving a Tesla
Yeah but small to midsized companies prefer hubspot, zoho, or zendesk sell. Mostly salesmen hate CRMs, they just wanna sell and not dealing with complicated software. They are rarely willing to learn all over again, because they just wanna sell something. Salesforce is tremendously more complicated than any mentioned CRMs above. I think Zendesk is a. true competitor to salesforce. And there is another difference: marketing and sales CRMs are way different. You cannot do telecalls with infusionsoft or ontraport, you need this spicey zendesk sell for it. Because they are focused on email marketing instead of sales calls. Zendesk in general has a strong more user friendly platform than salesforce and it’s cheaper. And I can asure you, nobody will take salesforce to manage their local shops, this area is owned by SAP. Or Hospital Systems. SAP has very strong Lock In effect, which makes changing more expensive often times than switching to another system. Hoe Do I know all this shit? I’ve worked with all of these CRMs. Generally: Salesforce to SAP comparing doesn’t make sense at all. Just google a bit deeper instead of reading bullshit signals and news.

+35% on the year. I was +100% from March puts but held puts too long thinking the market had to keep going down... but it didn't. Ended up getting into negative territory, was getting too emotional and making stupid plays so I took a step back. Put what I had left in boomer stock and took a long break. Came back when the NIO, PLTR runs were starting and made some nice gains from that.

Nah, I dont think any confirmation. At this point I would consider it educated speculation at most.

Dont get me wrong you or others could be right in guessing that they never had the supply to begin with and simply under sold compared to previous years.

Could even be argued as they were trying to close down unprofitable stores they were unwinding merchandise.

I would argue as a side point for a company seemingly trying to turn itself around, doing something like that during the busiest seasons (unwinding product (shipping back to warehouses and shit)) would basically be the and I do mean the STUPIDEST thing they would have done.

 When I was younger, maybe junior high, I got roped into watching my 3 month old niece while my sister got her hair done. So when there i am, sitting in the waiting area of a hair salon with my niece and who walks in but Ryan Cohen.

I was nervous as fuck, and just kept looking at him, as he read a magazine and waited, but didn't know what to say. Pretty soon though my niece started crying, and I'm trying to quiet her down because I didn't want her to bother Daddy Cohen, but she wouldn't stop. Pretty soon he gets up and walks over. He started running his hands through her hair and asking what was wrong. I replied that she was probably hungry or something. So, Ryan put down his magazine, picked up my niece and lifted his shirt. He breast fed her right there in the middle of a hair salon. Chill guy, really nice about it.

Nobody pays 8% dividends for long. That indicates the company is compensating investors for massive risk and/or negative growth potential. 

Anybody who promises dividend yields at or above s&p market growth rate is doing this.
I couldn’t imagine being in a position where 600 dollars made a difference to me, I delivered the newspaper as an 8 year old, I worked at chuck e cheese as the mouse lol when I was 13 making like 4 something an hour

Even then 600 dollars would have done nothing, do the math u didn’t even get half of the amount of the bill, I think people in Uganda got more money

I would choose a strike price you truly believe will not be exercised. When I sell covered calls, my goal is always to get the premium and make sure I KEEP MY SHARES. Rinse and repeat for max profit. I tend to sell monthlies, not weeklies, as the premium is better.

Edit: to answer your question which I realize I haven’t, I would definitely put the strike price at 31$+

NIO gonna have a +20% day on Monday. Trust me I’m retarded.
so wqt your saying is my 300 shares have hope?
I'll give a quick synopsis because it can get pretty in depth when you start looking at greeks and stuff. A butterfly is just a combination of a vertical credit spread and vertical debit spread with the short strikes at the same strike. You want to collect as much premium from those short strikes while collecting as much value from the long position, so you want the price to be as close to the short strikes as possible on expiration day - that's how you make most of your money. 

Eg. XYZ is currently at $100. You think by the end of the month it'll go to $125 so you build a butterfly where you buy a $100 call, sell 2 $125 calls, and then buy one $150 call (the difference between the strikes should be the same, unless you're doing advanced strategies like a broken wing or something). If on expiration, the price is at 125, you've reached max profit. If it blows past your short strikes you're protected to the upside with the $150 call. Profit is limited, but you risk so much less money doing this strategy than just buying calls without a hedge (the short positions).

It's not a great explanation, but you can read and watch videos about it, too.
Large financial institutions have large amounts of capital. And an option that is in the money will always have somebody that will buy it.

To answer your question directly, it's most likely an automated purchase and execution from a financial institution (market maker, investment firm, really anything with those capabilities), not some random guy that hopes he can click fast enough to make a few cents per share.

Once you're a millionaire they'll just want you for your money. It's not like you can hide that kind of drive. Once the novelty of being with a millionaire wears off they cheat, you divorce, and they get half. Suddenly you're just half a millionaire. You either need two million or a new plan.

That’s not even a stock you idiot. It’s a movie, staring Bruce Willis
Because it’s 2021 and if 2020 was bad for you it only gets better. If 2020 was good for you.. it was only a taste test. 1k? 1k? You’re a lucky little bitch. I lost 1k writing this. You mean you got a thousand dollar right off for this tax season. You’re going to fuck the man and claim a 5k loss instead. You know why? Because we can. Boo hoo. Such a sad story... I kid I kid... pick your sorry ass up and stop buying Weekly FD’s aka loss leaders and level up your game. Pimping ain’t easy but some of us gotta win and kid the secret to making 1k into 20k is.... is... is...  buy earnings going against the grain. When this place tells you GME is done at $12.35 guess what we do we buy an extra 45 shares aka 450 shares. Long story short is pick a ticker and have some balls to ride it out because we ride these Easy wins in to more easy wins. How are you actually losing? I know you got winners in you. Do you know you have em? DO YOU?

I started with $500 and I’m at 23.5k and guess what? My first play was a fucking $250 DIS weekly that went up to 5k pre earnings and I didn’t sell. What did I learn?

Honestly anyone under 80% up for the year has failed miserably, myself included.

So many stocks if you just went in shares between mid-March through June you would be up 40-50% easy.

Up 156% this year. Covid got me good and i stopped until Sept. big loss and came back again end of Nov. PLTR is the first bump and dump down to -98% and then TSLA 665 calls for the next bump and then 12/31 TSLA 680 calls. Was at 57k but that EOD dump wiped all of that. Currently holding 1/4 372 SPY calls. 


TLDR: total amount out in 15k, lowest point 1300 or -98%, currently at 40k~, 156%

I like those ideas and that’s why I bought them originally. However, for the valuation to hold, all of those have to play out. Lots of execution risk and the upside is mostly priced in.

Lockups expire on Feb 11th. You don't want to buy this thing. It's going to tank approaching lockup cause there is like 1.5 Billion shares that are free to sell. You DONT want to be in PLTR when that happens cause the volume of trading in this stonk can not absorb that amount of selling. Feb & March will be a bloodbath.
You will be alright bro, my wife's boyfriend sends his regards
Is there any benefit to buying now instead of waiting a month?
Nearly all the stocks discussed here have negative earnings. I thought companies make money by selling more stock when it gets pumped up in 2020.
They sell because they don't look at it like that. They see: 1. you having short strikes; 2. not enough liquidity in your account to hold hundreds of shares of TSLA; and 3. a high likelihood that the short strikes will expire ITM (usually if the current price is within 10 points of your strike they see it as a high likelihood). So as a CYA for them, they see it as a high risk trade and force the close. That and their commissions are the main reasons I may switch over to Tasty at some point. Tasty has a setting that says "I'm managing this position, don't close it" and they apparently do their best not to. They also have an exponentially better commission system than TOS.
I think stuff like that should be taught at the high school level. Not everyone is going to go to college but they could still use information like that.

Oh, here I thought $X invested at price A (>B) gives you less shares than if you invested at price B.

Which means a different amount of shares to sell when at $300.

But I'm sure you'll educate me otherwise..

edit:

You're right. it would be $300k vs $1.1M with an initial investment of $33k.

Bears went extinct
Nobody tell him
Was down $13,000 from my break even and down $25,000 from ATH between June, September, and election crashes and thinking I could gamble SPY 1DTE to make back what I lost in September (protip: you always lose). Have slowly dug my way out to just down $8,000 from break even with shares and cash secured puts and some credit spreads.
now that everyone is shitting on PLTR, i think it means to actually buy
Yep, pretty much.

The logic of a frantic child
If half the YOLO broz on WSB bought underlying equity rather than options, there's be more green for all of us.
Don’t expect any more price war from Tesla:  

“With Tesla's localization rate, or the proportion of parts made in China, having hit its target, the electric vehicle giant is unlikely to cut prices in the near future, state-owned Chinese news outlet Yicai Media said, citing Tao Lin, Tesla's China vice president.”

https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/tesla-unlikely-cut-model-3-233314406.html

This makes sense.  Tesla wants to hurt Chinese EVs during their infancy stage.  Now that they are growing  out of their infancy stage, price cut won’t have the same effect.

They’re up huge in premarket you better be ready in 10 mins

First post I’ve read acknowledging it’s closure for the day. Hilarious
Wait. This isn’t GME or PLTR
I'm from 3rd world and our economy depends on coke
Wow it’s way to early for this lol
And keep lobsters in your hierarchy. Or something...
Say goodbye to your money
The markets sure are flat today
If we’re adjusting for inflation that means the stock goes to Mars instead of the moon.
Imagine all of WSB gets their stimulus check and runs to put it in the market and watch the prices go up! Then the price drops and they look around and ask what happened?! Well, Johnny, you bought stonks with the money and didn't spend any of it. Which means these companies make no money and stonks fall. Cause companies make a lot of money when savings rates are low & credit card debt is high from buying lots of things! They don't make any money when savings rates are high and you paid off your credit cards. RIP.

Don't try to hard to find a goal. Focus on what you want to do and things will work themselves out
Holy shit the amount of people who think markets will open at 930 is actually interesting. I think we can pump and dump some after hours Robinhood stocks for real.
You need it to rocket today?

No need to rush or put added pressure on yourself, you’ll eventually find what you’re looking for. Just make sure to keep an open mind and a positive outlook, things will work out eventually my dude
Loooool you can’t be serious
Average down on calls , that's my plan once market opens I just needed to raise a few extra hundred since they're deep itm already .
Not sure, but guess we’ll be mooning tgt anyways, welcome aboard

This comment tries too hard. Every joke on wsb? Check. Positions or ban. Tired of these...
If they get the price down coupled with peak production capacity they should do really well. Now that the legacy automakers are stepping in as long as Tesla can keep beating them with the tech, like staying ahead in autonomy, they can hang onto significant market share.

Haha so accurate
Both parties spend just as much, believing differently is just retarded. Just do a small amount of research yourself.
Tech will run as long as we’re still in a pandemic, a few of the big players or really innovative ones will keep going and the others will get a correction to some extent.
What?
You know what’s the worst? When you realize that it’s all a fake. When you realize the whole game in life  you’re actually worth it.... your the boss and no bitch can tell you otherwise. Money comes and goes but self respect and ambitions... only Mitch McConnell has haha jk but no giving up and only up up up up and away 📈. If you have tasted the bottom all you know is how the worst tastes. The best part is that your already can handle the bad. WAit till you show them how good taste.

As a new trader (November for options, June otherwise) PLTR taught me that high IV stocks and far OTM calls less than 3 months away are a no go for me. Shares and covered calls will be my go to from now, with minor option plays when big opportunities arise (PLTR post February shares release will be one, i think)
wtf?! how am i supposed to know what my stonks would be worth in the new year if the market isn’t open???? 😤
My resolution is to stop checking all the shit I plan to hold for months every 30 minutes
I wish for all you fine people a solid 2021 filled to the brim with crisp tendies. May the Yellen be with you.

I'm just telling him the shit that I wish people said on this sub whenever I was trying to figure out what to do lol. 

Don't get me wrong, I LOVEEEE the retard culture around here, but when people are playing with all of the money that they have.... idk, maybe it's nice to offer legitimate advice? Lol


And I'm sure I'm leaving gains on the table by suggesting calls so close to the money but (and this is just a theory of mine lol we will see how it goes) I think I'll make more money, more quickly by buying options conservatively and making sure I make money on every single trade and never lose. 

Cuz it seems to me that ppl around here win big, but then lose just as big... But if you always win, you're eventually gonna get there. So idk why that's not a more popular strategy.
Anyone know how PLTR is doing in premarket? I can't get it to update. I have 10k in weeklies that went otm yesterday and I need it to 🚀 today

Break Even is Strike Price + Premium paid. But this does actually only matter if you want to execute the option. If you sell the option before expiration you still make profit as you can see in your example because the option has an intrinsic value / time value.
Started with 10k and built it up to 40k thanks to thic🐝, but lost around 15k from retarded QS puts.

Now currently at 25k, all in’d thic🐝 warrants. Hopeful for a DA within next 1-2 weeks

I never found a girl that would be like " let's fucking do it". I never found a woman in my life trying to think like let's work together, build something up get rich and then worry about ourselves. All need emotional attention, all played games or were having totally different path of being safe and small, not trying to work hard to make it big. Absolutely no girl in my life would suck it up and try hard . I am in luck getting nice girls, but not hard and smart working.  

Thus I found I am much better sticking with a few Bros and work together to make something big.

Whenever I don't talk with any girls,I get further ahead in life. I tried 3 times having a relationship in 4 years, and the period I was pursuing that, I was at my lowest. Now I realised what path I need to take before i settle

Risked $188 to make $1098. Was really annoyed because TOS closed my positions even though I told them I was managing them and would close them myself. Had they waited another 5 minutes until TSLA dipped between my short strikes of 695-700 I would've made another 1k. But, can't be greedy, made $1,000 while doing heavy deadlifts in my garage.
Not crazy at all. Reddit is owned by China or Chinese investors
Anywhere between 0$ and 700$
Communism is an ideology, Trumpism is a cult.
I think too many retards went all in on the hype of an infinity squeeze when it has been talked about for like a decade now and still hasn't happened, and as long as people are trying to close their position green, won't happen. I'll be proud of you retards if you all hold your shares long enough for a squeeze to happen, but I think a lot of people are going to end up losing out on GME because their wealth is bleeding dry and that's a hard thing to stomach

UGH, this dip is killing me. PLTR is such a big part of my portfolio but all I want to do every time it goes on sale is BUY MORE! I have zero doubts we’re going to the moon and the longer we wait, the better I can build my position. But every time it dips it makes me rethink my strategy and I try to figure out how to find more money to buy more! 💎🙌

They used 2019 for the 1st stimmy too.  They only used 2018 if people hadn't filed 2019 when the checks went out.

They changed the full cutoff from 99k (1st stimmy) to 87k (this one)
It plummets if this happens

Shorting is a good way for people with shitloads of capital and risk tolerance to manipulate a better buy in. He probably doesn't win every short, TSLA *cough*, but he's got the money to do it.

Magic 8ball says youre probably right
But for real. No other place on the internet I could find degenerates with enough money to know about some quality shit(wipes).

I switched to cotton hand towels in the kitchen instead of paper towels a few years ago. And as those towels get too "dirty looking" to sit in the kitchen, they get a double wash in bleach and Rit'd to the bathroom color so I don't mix them up in the future, and I've been using them to dry my butt after spraying it off.

But 2021 is gonna be a good year, wanna upgrade.

God you guys have no reading comprehension lol. The first sentence clearly says what the viable delivery fee should be for it to make sense for dash, NOT FOR YOU. Sure it’s worth it to you to pay $5 delivery fee for your $20 meal. But it makes no sense for door dash to deliver that for you at $5 they’re losing money on you
Still wrong but keep playing dumb
It's about the journey not the destination.

90% of DASH shares that are locked up right now we’re purchased at $8.73. DASH is currently trading at $142. 284 million shares bought at $8.73 will enter the market when lockup expires in March. Think about that. If you don’t believe me, go to page 91 of DASH’s S1 

[Page 91 DOORDASH S1](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1792789/000119312520292381/d752207ds1.htm)

It’s always good to double down on ignorance
Tech stocks are so meta
I spent like a lot of money on delivery you know. I order like $30 on average, but when I go to restaurants or fast food in physical, I spend like $10
Relationships basically kill all your time.

There is a reason 99% of married men are 40 year cucks. Sure correlation != causation but you have much fewer oppurtunities to make it in life with the pressures of working like a cuck for regular pittance instead of opening a business or YOLOing all your money in weekly call options.

Yes I am not really defending the buisness model just correcting the mistake on fees and noting membership. I wouldn't touch it unless somehow the 3 companies consolidate into one
Find nearest Wendy's dumpster, practice your kegels
haha you came back to downvote once you realized you were wrong
Business economics of food delivery dont add up. It’s a money hemorrhaging endeavor unless they raise fees dramatically and at that point people would be best served driving to pick up the food themselves
All of my money is already in PLTR
"maybe one last run before everything crashes" -- what do you mean exactly? What is your definition of a crash here?
Sometimes Mr Market gives you a chance and it's not because he likes you. It's to test your retardation.

Prior to GME 52w high>>>>22.35, he asks you if you want to sell it for 22.40 in PM while the bid is 22.20 and the ask is 22.80

Yeah I took it. Sold GME at higher than 52w high

This aut got lucky and he knows it. Maybe 2% was skill but surely it was mostly luck


With that said, Gme's gonna moon. Ain't no doubt

Edit: I have a feeling they they gonna fuck with deepfuckingvalue's jan 15 calls. Do what you may with it. See my post history, iPUMP GME but money is Hella real

Edit 2: they downvote because they are the round number suckers at 22, 21, 20, 19. Oh round numbers always look great
What a year. I would’ve made more just holding stock. So many people turned pennies to hundreds of thousands. Wish I wasn’t retarded
Tsla in India 🇮🇳and China 🇨🇳 🚀🚀🚀🚀
No way. All of apps in my area charge around $5, 


And when I order, I order like $20 at least so it’s worth it
That might work out well if they’re at least medium dated.

You’ll be serving him drinks if it does haha! Imagine yoloing 6 figures into options...
🤣🤣🤣🤣  F
you fucking retard
Months? You meant minutes, right
Yeah if you choose to just take the $20 or whatever the base is at merger instead of holding through the ticker change then those warrants go to someone else. It’s 2/9 minimum that you get for holding. If enough people don’t hold, then the pool who do shrinks and so they get even more than 2/9. It can go to 4/9 if half of the holders sell, for example. That’s the tontine structure - tontine is this 300 year old economic investment set up where as people die, those who remain get more. So that’s why it’s called tontine and that’s why it’s a strong value hold.

Example

If you buy 5,000 shares at $25 dollars and hold through and we assume it’s 2/9 then you get the option for warrants at an exercise price of $23 for another 1,111 shares. So your average price for your 6,111 shares is now $24.64. 

The warrants are exercisable at the later of 1) 30 days post merger or 2) July 2021. Once the warrants become exercisable management can issue a redemption clause which means they give you 30 days notice to do something with the warrant or they take them from your for $0.01 each. They can only do the redemption if the stock is trading at $36 or more for 20/30 trading days though.

Long story short is don’t fall asleep on this when the merger happens. If the stock appreciates meaningful, which it will on LOI and leading into the merger, you could have a situation where the stock price is like $50 or $60 dollars or more. I think it now has to at least double on the LOI news because it has a new floor at $27 and such intense interest. 

People online are going on about how there could be a deal imminent every time the price pops 3%. While a deal is imminent as its coming in Q1, its more likely that people are just waking up to this stock more and more. It received coverage on daytime CNBC for basically the first time on Wednesday. Good luck!
yes it could take a few more days
I feel bad for grub hub. They were the leader in 2018, now they losing market share. They could’ve been at least a $700 per share if they maintained their leader status, grub hub leadership is horrible
I’d take that analysis with a pinch of salt if I were you. There’s definitely a market out there for take out delivery. Not saying DASH will be successful, but I wouldn’t dismiss them or similar companies on that basis.
In so deep i got no shaft left, ill try pop a ball in..
Nobody tell him
You said McAfee 🤣🤣🤣 clearly an expert!

Are there any good websites for looking at sorting and searching through stock ticker’s? When I’ll try to look for one it seems like every website is trying to give me their best pick and that’s not what I’m looking for. 

A little birdie told me about a payment processing company that was about $1.10 a few days ago and now I can’t find it and I’m trying to search for it and instead all search engines are trying to tell me what the best stock is.
100% FD's and sometimes I think about selling CC/CSP.
200 Shares @ 14.29$ 😏
That thought will never leave my mind 😀 but at least the year's over
Imagine defending the business economics of fucking door dash. Be my guest bro 

And it’s not saying fees are $10 now it’s saying that’s around the rate dash should be to eek a profit. And having a membership is even worse, $0 delivery fee? How the fuck will dash ever make money? Good for the consumer horrible for dash bottom line

> much easier to find options that match specific criteria

Ok... well, since you asked...

What I want from an options screener, that I have never found, is to be able to look at volume for the past (day, week, months) that identifies steady, regular low volume accumulation and then matches a filter for the very first early hockey stick departure from that pattern and provides call option alerts for the two sigma strike.  If I really had my wants and desires met, the second part, the matching of the hockey stick departure, would use machine learning from previous matching patterns of every other stock matching the general parameters of the ticker identified by the machine learning early hockey stick detection.

Think you can do that for me?
Would have to be something ridiculous like a .01 debit spread. AAPL 145/146 1/08 bid ask is .01-.03. 1000 good fills on it (unlikely) followed by AAPL having 5 +2% days, or 3 +3% days (unlikely) would turn that 1000 into 100k.

Yes but that's if you do a loan modification you can also do a covid 19 deferral "A COVID-19 payment deferral allows you to bring your mortgage current by delaying repayment of forbearance amounts without changing other terms of your mortgage. This option may be available if you cannot afford a reinstatement or repayment plan. You will not be charged interest on the forbearance amounts, which will be due and payable at the maturity of the mortgage loan or earlier whenever you sell or transfer of the property, refinance the mortgage loan, or pay off the interest-bearing unpaid principal balance." Fanniemae.com. this will not change your interest rate
Buy 2023 Tesla calls got it 😎
Buy PLTR and then you can taste disappointment. Pretty close to the taste of taint.
Chart looks bullish to me, traders are buying the dip. Rocket mission will start 2021
Hyundai bought it for $1.2B in 2020
That's what I see so you might be out with minimal losses or even make some money you sell at the bell if NIO is up premarket. Try to sell immediately though and get out without any losses.
So puts then?

It’s implying that’s how much should be charged for DASH to be profitable and no one in their right mind is gonna pay that for a delivery fee when most people order just 1 meal for themselves at work.

There is no 10 dollar delivery fee plus most people who order regularly have membership which gives you $0 fees.

Thst said I am not fan of the stock probably need to see some consolidation between uber eats, doordash and grubhub.

It's gonna crash again. All the money is in money market and savings accounts. Massive inflows into bond funds despite the poor rates. No one is coming into the market at these levels. Just turn on CNBC next week I guarantee you there's a ton of bears talking about a correction coming. It's cause money ain't coming in until the correction comes. You can try to go sideways or trickle up, but problem is all these IPOs, SPACs, and new issuance gonna flood this market with supply cause they know it's overpriced. Options traders will die cause of sideways action. Demand will eventually peter out.

I work in sales and every single company I've ever worked for has used Salesforce and has invested millions on custom dev work and building teams specifically to manage the administration. As an end user the software itself is miles ahead of the competition its laughable.
Just making on time payments they sent me mail saying I qualified for increases due to my “exceptional payment history”
The 200 MA with 4 hour candles is 22.50 currently so there might be big support there. I’ve been selling covered calls on it and it’s worked really well, but I’ll likely sell a few hundred shares before the lockout date.
It's called aluminum foil and this was a pump and dump by PLTR insiders not hedge fund manipulation
SAP and Salesforce are definitively the same, boomer software over priced and shitty as hell.

But since boomers still hold economy aggree they can still win for the next 5 or 10 years.
Nicee, and I hear ya, it’s def very richly valued. I’m still buying more though cause FSD is the golden goose. I think their computer vision using massive fleet data approach - the hard way, as opposed to training wheels Lidar and safe space geofences (the easy way) - will win, can scale massively basically overnight, is coming within the year, and will just absolutely print money. Lots of people want Teslas but can’t afford them, what happens in 2-3 years when the car starts paying for itself? What happens to the auto industry when taking a Tesla robotaxi regularly for trips around town is cheaper than owning an ICE car? Crazy shit will happen, I’m all in babyyy
Go long SAP and CRM they are both best in class in growing industries. 
If you short CRM you must be truly retarded. 
They are one of the best managed companies in the US and are valued quite fairly.
Even if you bought the LEAPs it would never be enough.

Okay man you don't want to lose that money, and these people literally aren't going to help at all cuz... IDK in this sub they don't give straightforward advice. You have to pretend to be retarded XD

But you actually DID something retarded and if that's all your money I don't want you to be broke because you could be making a massive amount of money these next two weeks.



Yes, sell those immediately as soon as the market opens. Even if you have to take a loss. Sell. Immediately.

Then buy $50- $51calls (you won't be able to afford as many but at least this way you'll actually make money and not just literally throw away $3,000 on nothing) that expire on either 1/15 or 1/22. Take your pick... I bought 1/22 calls because I am particularly risk-averse (plus I'm bullish and it may grow more with an extra week (also might not)


You will 100% make money buying what I said.

I hope that's advice you will take lol


Even if you don't do what I said then at the very least get your fucking money back out the stock has absolutely no chance at all of hitting $80 before your calls would expire so I mean you're literally lighting $3k on fire right now... Sell immediately Monday even if it's at a couple hundred dollar loss (if you get lucky you'll get your full money back + a few extra dollars it may pick up over the weekend)... But, get. Your. Money. Back. Lol

Edit: reading some of the comments that you have replied to people, you are pretty discouraged but I mean for real dude you can get back out with probably at least $2800 (if not more) selling as soon as the market opens Monday


And then if you buy back in with the calls that I'm telling you, you WILL make money. 100%. So your opportunity to make money is not gone in the slightest.
Damn well at least detroit citizens can at least afford fireworks I guess.

Andrew Left (Citron) needs to stop posting bullshit on Twitter and start posting his actual positions. I doubt he actually shorts anything.
Well you’re right and you’re wrong. The forbearance can only extend for 12 months max. Your interest is accruing the entire time and they will want all the money at the end of the 12 month period or you can roll it into the back of your loan after a new interest rate is attached to your loan. So, if you like your interest rate don’t fuck with it. If you want to risk your house then it’s a free country. Also, no tax deduction from not paying your mortgage. Play the game but pay the bank. They don’t play.

“Thus, the viable delivery fee range is somewhere north of $10 and at that price point demand falls off substantially. Who is going to order a $6.50 meal at Taco Bell and pay $10 to have it delivered?

I’m sure some people will, but it isn’t going to be enough to justify anywhere close to a $50B market cap. In order for DASH to work as a stock, demand growth would have to continue to be explosive and an enormous percentage of the population would have to be OK with paying $10-$15 delivery fees.

That's a tall ask and I don’t see it happening. $50B is far too much for a company that may never be profitable.”

Yup. Australia is the biggest supplier for iron ore, trade war between China and Australia meaning china no longer have that supplier and will need to look for another one so now the question is will other countries will produce enough replace Australia, or will china drive the price up for everyone
If you got 1K what the one YOLO THAT YOU WOULD DO TO TURN THAT INTO 100K?

Bought SNOW puts a month ago at $380 and cashed out yesterday for a 2 bagger.  

Retarded to buy puts on the indices tho
Danm my street looks like Fallout IRL. Whole road is filled with ash and used fireworks. Trash all over the fucking place and broken bottles. Felt like I was sleeping outside a club all night.
This is as close to free money as it gets.
I’m going to pay my whole balance off too today I think just to have a fresh start for 2021. My credit score will jump because I was just using it for the 0% apr for like 4 months but it’s ending soon

Fucking hell. So you get 2 warrants for every 9 shares held post-merger? What’s meant by this:

>holders who redeem their shares will lose their right to such warrants

By redeem they mean sell? 

I should come back to this when I’m not hungover.
You lose 100% of the shots you don't take and you also lost 100% with the shots you took
Bro it’s okay you messed up here’s some advice. let nio  go past 30 and when it hits 35-40 just sell your contract you’ll probably still loose money but not as much as if you wait for expiration date because of something called theta next time just choose a closer strike price so if the stock is at 20 choose 30
Negative Rates would cripple our monetary system.

Yeah so we should probably stop buying shit I guess.
Stop buying all the properties in my state and making people file applications to rent them. Move here and deal with people face to face if you want to use our land so badly you monsters. And learn how to drive
You know it, words definitely matter. That category shift signals big things for this ICR conference. I've been looking forward to January all year—for many reasons—it should be an interesting month! 💎🤟😎🚀🚀🚀
Is this still something people believe?
You technically are only down 50% so it can’t be THAT retarded. I eat 50% losses daily. Making money is for losers

Anyone think there's price manipulation going on with iron ore this past few years?
The realest of YOLOers are the 🌈🐻
LOL--FED rules are last 4q earnings-dividends paid.  They have zero cash for buybacks.  They could take down loan loss reserves--which might actually work--they seem way over reserved.
Fair enough

whos buying puts in this market?
Hahahahahahahahhaahahahahahhaha you sold them? You belong here.

TMUS for the win! Verizon aint have no movement this year!
Papa made me a lot of money this year. That being said, I still can’t get over this valuation, it’s insane. I think Tesla takes years to grow into this valuation and I don’t think the stock moves much either way as it does this. I think it will trade somewhat sideways.
lol, have you seen the move they made (and still are making)?
Hope you sold some?

The bell curve award?
Share buy backs are limited to last 4q earnings - dividends paid.  They dont have cash for it unless they grossly over reserved....that being said I'm long WFC and this is a more level headed bet than most the stuff on here.  Might as well throw in some XOM calls while you're at it.

Market makers are free to make all the profit they want, I'll also make profit sometimes on being able to buy a contract for a single dollar flat
Lfgggggggg
There was a lot of lost potential this year in every retailer. There are contracts in place throughout the supply chain, and those resulted in shortages, because they were likely written before everything went haywire. 

There is also some hesitance for companies to panic buy, because unsold merchandise is a liability.  If your sales are up 150%, you don't necessarily want to start making orders for 200% of you prior orders. You *might* be able to sell more and bring your sales higher, but you could also see sales start to drop to prior levels, leaving you with twice as much merchandise as you can move.  Now you've got to either store it and hope it eventually sells before it starts losing value, or, you take the loss and discount it just to get it out of your inventory. 

The more money you leave tied up in unsold merchandise, the less you have for other investments, like new merchandise. 

This happened hardcore this year with hand sanitizer. The local Walmart and Target near me have pallets of sanitizer sitting in their stockroom, and that's *after* they donated 1000s of bottles to the local schools and Emergency Services.
If I wanted to get a million dollars of a certain option how long will it take to fill

Thinking the same, just bought some stock of at 93 the other day
Wrong forum. Lame political speculation isn't found here. Add rocketships and talk about Tesla or Gamestop and you'll fit in here.
Lol it’s not the end of the world, your never gonna learn sitting on the sidelines, best thing you did was post this to get some help. Like other said come Monday just sell it, next time try and buy calls at or lower than the stock price and atleast 5-6 months of expiration time. I lost around 50k in options this year but made 300 so the education was worth it. The best education one can buy is losing YOUR own money. It will push you to find out what went wrong fast.
I know that feeling, happened to me when Landcadia Holdings became Golden nugget online gaming this week.

If mitch is still in the senate in a couple weeks then all hope for America is gone
Agreed.  It's on discount now.  It's a good buy. I have worked in SaaS for 10 years and every company I've ever worked for uses SFDC and it's essential to the business.  Everyone is expanding usage not shrinking it. Also I can see the slack integration working really well. They already have done some moves to get into this area (like chatter) and I think there is potential there.
Medieval cavalry went through horses like you blow through your wifes boyfriends money.
Damn you just made WSB your portfolio controller didn't you.
Sorry, the cup of coffee is empty, no more money left
And if I pay 66 cents and still don't get a fill at my target price I just wasted my time. There's no guarantee, so it's not always worth it.

Yeah and WinRAR still asks for money everytime I download tranny porn but it's just as likely to see cash as Comcast is.
Just need Boston Dynamics to give GME one of these as a new mascot and the squeeze would start tomorrow
Were you aware of the incoming share dilution? Just knocked several dollars off that price. It’s at a discount currently but that fucked me.

I'm representing myself & also poor enough to probably not need to pay any significant filing fees or anything. Best case Robinhood sends lawyers and makes a big deal of it and loses the fucking case and gets annihilated to shit because they've never been challenged on this thievery in a court in a state as fair as mine and they think they can win but actually can't, most likely case is Robinhood doesn't send anyone because it would cost them more to fly someone out to represent them in court than it will cost to just pay whatever a judge will rule against them for not showing up in such a small case and it's not worth the risk of making the case high-profile enough to really damage them, worst case is they send lawyers and win the case and I get no money and do no real damage to them but at least they spent way more money dealing with this in court than they made stealing from me and I still come out of this feeling more satisfied with the series of events than anyone on Robinhood's side even though they technically won

They don’t want the whole ERP ecosystem, let Workday have HR and shit like that. Salesforce is long collaboration and selling. As a poster above mentioned they’re fucking amazing at M&A. How this stock isn’t back to $265 is beyond me. It should hit $300 this year.

Counterpoint: Many companies would love to leave SAP, but they cannot as the alternatives are worse and costs to move are heavy.

With CRM solutions, companies trying to build and maintain their own usually regret it. Salesforce is THE CRM for a reason and is likely to continue to grow.

Not sure how Slack fits in for them, but they have the money to throw around. Even if they dont incorporate Slack, its a good product to build a new business division with.

Salesforce is bullish long term imo

Tesla has a crazy lead and is growing 50% per year but the move is just don’t think about it, just buy as many leaps or shares as you can, wait a year for FSD to drop, watch them start putting these weak-ass other purchased-parts assemblers out of business, and get rich with Papa.

But you see this time around, we are giving millions to millionaire and billionaire via PPP so it should all trickle down. For example Tom Brady got a cool million from PPP and bought a new boat.
Bro, you getting ripped off because I pay like $1500 for the whole year and that is tax deductible.

How much do you pay for health insurance?
Cathie selling tesla...why??
Hard bass foreva
I’m still up!.... 7%...
I am sorry but how are calls loosing you so much money?? Isnt it optional to exercise them? Or are you paying stupid high premiums?
Sell for a loss immediately... if you can find a buyer
Pay .66 for commission and maybe you will get a fill at the price you want not 10 or 15 dollars higher or lower. Youre talking about simple maths but it is not simple. Shares should always be no commission. But Something thst is free for option order fillsjust means they have hidden the costs elsewhere. Free brokers 100% send your fills to market makers like citidel. Why would they do this for free? Doesnt make sense until you start to see youre paying alot to get commission free orders

Edit: and i have heard you can negotiate price of commission down if you buy and sell alot of contracts. Ima businessman doing business
My goal is to have sex with twice as many women this year.  Or 1.  Whichever is greater.

It has to go up for you to make money on selling the option to another shmuck. But time will burn your profit if any and you’ll probably end up losing something. I would sell it the moment the market opens on Monday. And this is coming from someone who is super bullish about NIO. How the fuck do you think it’s gonna go up more than $30 in two weeks. There’s no way.

Don’t worry too much, your average civilian probably won’t end up on anything I’m flying. That being said I don’t blame you for being nervous sitting in a chair in the sky.
Sounds good thank you
Lol that's my reason. Calls are hella cheap but fucking free money. I see a potential pop in March when contracts for the next year's stadiums and venues start signing. If there's no pop, it still prints. Market manipulation hits hard first hour of trading every Monday. Buy the dip and ride it out till 10am for a boner so hard you can trash the blue pills youve been stealing from your wife's boyfriend.
LOL SalesForce has crushed every earnings report. And to say that Slack doesn’t fit in anywhere in their ecosystem shows me you have no idea wtf you’re talking about. They have done an amazing job integrating Tableau and MuleSoft so far and Slack is the perfect complement for them to have a good platform for reps and teams to communicate and share data and automate internal tasks. It’s also opening a whole new line of customers. But don’t listen to me I’m biased with about $50k in calls on CRM.
I didn’t even buy the calls at ATH. Got it around 27-28 range & still got fucked 😞

Second this. Every business I consult with has or is in the process of getting salesforce.

You belong here. You just describe a State Capitalist economy that'll throw its defenders, like you, under the bus every time to fill pockets of Multi Billionaires with your tax dollars to save them from failing because of their poor financial decisions. Think Airlines this year. Those bitches spent 96% of  excess cash flow due to Trump corporate tax cut from last 3 years for stock buybacks, and had no savings as emergency funds, so when the pandemic and lock down hit, these airline bitches were asking for bailout money **a month** into a lock down in March. If you are actually a true capitalist, how can you ever support this? Where was their emergency fund? Isn't saving emergency funds to cover atleast 6 months or 180 days of costs a good business practice? Maybe they should cut their avocado toast and Starbucks coffee to save some money (see what i did there?) When people struggle on the main street like they are doing rn, literally millions in bread lines across America rn, it is personal responsibility, but when these corporations mismanage their funds and then shamelessly ask for bailouts, idiots like you defend this Corporate Socialism by Fed as

PDT is the pattern day trading rule. That means with a margin account (Robinhood for example) you can't make more than 3 round trips (day trades where you buy and sell in the same day) in a five business day period unless you have $25k or more. 

Margin allows you to borrow money from your broker in order to leverage your account balance. It's typically double your balance. You can also use your proceeds immediately since the funds "settle instantly" (You're actually borrowing money from the broker while you're waiting on your trades to settle) 

The most painful thing about the PDT rule is that it shifts your focus from making good trades and taking profits to counting down your trades and you end up taking unnecessary risks like holding overnight or averaging down on a losing position. 

Personally, there is more benefit to having a cash account IMO. If you trade options your funds settle the next day and you can make a trade with your full portfolio again. It stops you from over trading by only allowing you to use up to your account balance once per day.

Tesla at 668 mkt cap, how much higher you think it's gonna go? Its already at ridiculous levels. IMO you could invest the original amount in Netflix which I think is valued quite low.
"Good use" then proceed to buy a stock after it is up 30% in 2 days.

I had sorta the same deal.  Wife and her family thought I was a loser.  I had purchased LEAPs on TSLA @ 200 in the 401k but after finding out some really bad stuff and being told that she didn’t love me for the 100th time, I liquidated the positions and parked em there for the pending divorce :(
Woulda been baller to keep but it woulda made her rich af too lol.

There are people who do a rational analysis and base their predictions on that. Just saying it will do this or that without basing that on anything is pointless.

Ok, so we've established that your prediction is unfounded.
I had this lab partner once.  Her breath stank so bad.  Like pot breath and coffee.  So every time I wake n bake, I can’t have coffee.  Because I will be reminded of that breath.

It's nice when people self identify as a moron right up front. Saves a lot of time down the rode.
Someome has an extra chromosome. You belong here, you're home.
If you can get one girl to sleep with you, others will too.
In the US, that’s not how taxes work. For example, let’s say that from $0~$50k your tax bracket is 30%, and from $50k~100k your tax bracket is 40%. If you make 51k, it just means that for the first 50k you will be taxed 30%, and the remaining 1k you get taxed 40%. So you will always end up with more money even after taxes, if your income is higher.
So... I hold a master's in comp sci. My areas of focus were network admin + security for undergrad, security for master's. I program for a living, and I taught myself that wholly from the ground up.

Could I have gotten the job without the degrees? No. Do I use any of my education professionally? Probably could also be said no. I mean... I am really good at doing all the little things that proliferate coding... setup\\config\\admin, but I do not administrate anything outside of my own dev\\test environments.

idk if they do it this way in America too, but where i'm from you can donate shares directly to a charity. so instead of cashing out and paying capital gains and then giving cash, you get the full value of your shares as a tax deduction and the charity ends up getting a little more value out of it as well.

Do you people literally have sub-100 IQs?

As I just said to someone else:

> you either have a lot of money or you're not very diversified or you're getting scammed as shit, those are the only 3 options if you pay commissions at any prices I've seen on every trade you make with no commission free account for smaller trades

How can any of you need this explained to you? How can two of you in the span of a few minutes need this explained to you? How can this subreddit be so retarded that I'm not even surprised two of you in the span of a few minutes need this explained to you? Why do you try to scam people and act condescending about it like you're not just being an asshole? Is it the only way to make yourself feel better about being garbage?

Wow this was crazy to read.
Lies sleep is underrated
can you do a sarcasm screener for your first line?
100% overpriced garbage. I'm not going to take advice from any of you fucking retards on what paid broker to use, picking a paid broker if you're not retarded is a simple matter of doing the math on who has the absolute lowest dollar cost for the trades you expect to make, then checking if their reputability is sufficient to expect them not to steal from you, then repeating to continue up the list if necessary. You have to be bigly retarded to just hand money to a random business to execute trades for you based on zero reasoning except someone who can't even bother to make a compelling argument said a positive opinion about it. That's like the way a fucking golden retriever would pick a paid broker.

If you guys have any actual info on who to use for commission-free trades I'll take it, but opinions with zero compelling evidence for them are just fucking wasting my time and making me not like you, especially if they're asking me to give money to bullshit scams, so don't even bother talking to me about whatever shitty paid platform you use and/or shill for, and don't expect me not to interrupt your conversations with other people about it to point out how retarded you are.
Crsr is a brand and GME a retailer, they are not competing they will be working together.
karl urban gets like thirty seconds of screen time in rotk lol
A lot of chinese view the system as the only way to go to keep it falling apart, given the massive amount of the population and regardless of how much $$$ the country collectively have, they are still a "developing country " because the populace hasn't fully caught up yet to their riches.

Sure at tier one and major tier two cities they are like any modern country - but elsewhere the gap is still wide as fuck. We're talking like 500-600 mil people (30%+ of population) still in "rural" setup. That's twice our fucking population. 10 years ago it was 50% of the population in rural setting.

Things are changing rapidly tho and it'll be interesting to see when it all becomes urbanized.

Because of covid, china will probably eclipse the US economy 3-5 years faster than previously projected. That's when we'll become the number two economy in the world. Something like 2028-2029 vs ~2035.

We really fucked it up managing this situation. I'm not even sure at this point it's the administration's fault given the failure at almost every level. That's the problem of not being able to weld people into their fucking home I guess.

A retarded clock is right twice a day in my case. If the service is free, you're the product. Pay for customer service. I use RH for YOLO plays but that's it (I hate the idea of paying commission just to lose money). For real man the cost of "zero commission" is just hidden and you've already experienced that.

No worries it will eventually go up soon. I honestly don't see it tanking below 22. The only thing you are losing is the cost opportunity of the money you have locked in that stock but until you cash out you didn't lose shit

Nah just short the pump calls on here with long puts and it's easy money.
I'm deeply homosexual but even I am fully bullish on PLTR
Do whatever you want, it’s your money. 

I’ve never used 0 commission brokers, I’ve always just paid the commission and had peace of mind that I’m using a high quality broker with good fills and excellent customer support.

But just ask yourself how the hell are you gonna pick good companies to invest in if you can’t even decide on something as basic as which broker to use. I suggest you go do your own research instead of asking here.
You took it too far to quickly

There are no reputable brokers you fucking retard, E Trade is overpriced garbage. I need to find the least shitty paid option and the least shitty zero-commission option so that I have good platforms for each type of trade. I'm not asking you retards for advice on what the least shitty paid option is because I have no evidence any of you could give an answer that isn't retarded, but since you all hate Webull I am willing to hear out the case against Webull just in case there's actually any argument for it being as bad as Robinhood, but I'm guessing there's no reasoning there either and it's just another example of y'all being retarded.
I can't... it sucks

How the hell you so burned on RH yet your next position is webull? If you're concerned about the reputation of a broker, use a REPUTABLE broker. Buy a nice family car, stock up on folgers, and download E Trade or some shit.

I have forgotten most of my high school math classes, sorry about the delay.
Renewables are not as polar as they once were and are generally seen as a required infrastructure upgrade for the next 10 years. Even red states pump renewables. There are solid gains to be made but I wouldn't expect a leap because of senate moving from red to blue since renewable futures are probably already priced into any relatable equities at this point. I also can't pronounce most three syllable words so wtf do I know.
Good job.

Damn stimmy checks 2.0 cut off is 87K instead of 99k AGI from 1st checks.
Even if it's a made up story, the return on investment valuation presented above stands accurate. Could've happened in real life therefore it's valid and is usable as a reference. Other than that, I don't give a rat's ass about his gf and whatever drama described because these are irrelevant.
This is the way
I've avoided Webull in the past because China but now I'm not sure how that's supposed to matter in comparison to Robinhood anymore. The USA has been pretty clearly revealed to be worse than China at this point, and at this point Robinhood has stolen from me and locked my account for almost a year while stonewalling my attempts to contact support and now that I'm taking them to court over it they had reps threatening me via email, so what's Webull gonna do to be worse than that? Randomly wipe my account out and take all the money? That would honestly be easier to deal with than Robinhood's method of stealing individual positions at a time. I feel like the worst that can happen is I end up in court with them too but instead maybe they just won't fuck with me whereas Robinhood wants to fuck with me already for not letting them get away with fucking with me before. It makes no sense to me that people are telling me to avoid Webull because it's Chinese, unless they're just astroturfers / shills trying to advertise for overpriced shit like swimordrown or whatever it's called
Sounds interesting enough, would like to test it when it’s live!

Yes dis is def interesting. It should be able to filter by volume, implied volatility, delta & theta.Should be able to show multiple graphs of multiple options ( kinda like finviz). Maybe a feature to compare the prices with the company’s competitors
One day is the last and most difficult stage of the challenge.  
One can attempt the return in a month/week (which too is insanely difficult) - but the point of the challenge is to discover new and interesting techniques.
Fine from stealing ice exceeds the play like 200x over again for it to be profitable. Only in fucking WSB.
Why?
You said in your post above that losing hurts and you've been fomoing into Tesla. Of course it hurts and of course you want to make that money back, it's human nature. Don't deny it, it'll hurt your trading. 

"I know", mmm if you knew and stuck to what you know you wouldn't have lost everything you gained. That's really poor risk management. If you want to scalp, risk management is key because you legitimately cannot predict anything in minute candles. It really is like rolling a dice. The only possible thing that can save you is stop loss, 2% per trade, pulling out your profits and reinvesting only those profits. Your risk:reward should be at least 3:1 if not higher since in this casino you're very very likely to lose several times in a row and losses are far harder to recover from. 

For your sake, you should practice options on a paper trading account first. Investopedia has a free trading simulator where you're able to trade options. Too boring for you? Might as well just donate the money you want to gamble on to charity, then. You really will lose most of it without proper psychology and a strategy in place and it takes years to become profitable. 

I'm saying some absolute boomer shit. Regardless I hope you succeed.

Up 182% for the year. This is my first year trading options. Made the most off of IAC (15k in one day and still rising) and lost the most on TTD. But I will have my revenge. I’m coming for you in 2021 TTD.

Salty over my losses - dude what?
I know and could have lost 100% but with the way TSLA was moving I knew it would always move down. I dunno, maybe luck. Oh well
Same thing you do on weekends retard
The Big Short Film is every Bear's wet dream Fantasy whenever they buy puts on TSLA or any other meme stonk that went over 300% in a year or less
What are we supposed to do today
My entire stimmy will go into pltr shares, not calls, we all know how that goes.
I'm not a tech guy but does anyone in the business really look forward to a demo day rather than just requesting a demo the other 364 days of the year (at least any company of scale that would move the needle)?
Some REITs like NYMT, NLY, AGNC.  These pay ~8% annual dividend.  Or theta gang.
Just go into a trade that intrigues you. My dad got into "final build out" of network install for new construction. He literally had to work with the end user boxes of network connections in new apartment and condo builds. Doesn't even have to run wire or anything. Can't keep up with business and is always being  contracted all over(before covid) to finish installs.

Find what works for you instead of chasing a degree in something with major competition. The education platform is shifting and you should look to industry's that will grow based on what we use the most. Focus on indentify needs of a society and work back from there untill you find a job class your comfortable working. It's easy but not easy all the same time. Happy new year and I sincerely hope you change your life and are successful.

I think they way TSLA moves suits me perfectly.

AAPL weekly's are what got me in this mess in the first place
Ok peeps, right now it’s $23.72. If we buy we know stocks go up, and they go down. If you buy shares this shits eventually going up. So if you bought higher than $24, why not buy more to get your overall down? And wait for the next 28-30 to cash out. Or ride it long term?
!remind me 4 years
Not enough volume to hold them back, I sold plenty of puts at 18 and 20 to average down but I doubt we ever see 18 again
Edit:grammar
Uvxy @ 19 avg here

Jk I averaged down
I salute every WSB degenerate!
Just buy TSLA stock everytime you feel the urge to buy options.
I've got a cash account so I think I avoid it. I haven't had any emails or good faith violations
Nah put your money where your mouth is if you think you have plays from mediocre political speculation. Positions or ban. Cash is dead money as long as JPow is printing
Man, wish I could receive this many Awards on a post.
Wait, wasn't 2k promised, was this a fake news? (I am not a US citizen)
If you’re playing a stock that’s banned here that means you’re playing a stock that’s so retarded not even wsb will touch it. You should think about that
Very stress releiving, Money coming in, hold only shares and LONG calls. Always winning.
GME then either PLTR or RBLX if it doesn’t keep getting delayed.
I predict maybe some tech selloff but it would recover

Already planning to get another broker next time I put new money into trading, but first I'm using the old Robinhood account for practice and then I'll be trying to get the Robinhood account to new ATHs alongside whatever ends up being my main account with whatever other broker
Your reasoning is good, but I suspect shorting anything right now is too risky. Even NKLA is going up apparently.
That's perfect
INTC 3/19 $60c literally free 🚀
Lol good job
And I thought my week was bad.  Took me a year to get to $1500 making small calls and puts.  Then I got cocky and lost it all.
That’s not horrible I have double digits at $26. Seriously though if buying more at the current $23.72. To reduce my buy in. It’s gonna go back up eventually. 🚀🚀🚀🤣
When the market is sus. 😳😳😳
INTC 3/19 $60c literally free 🚀

Same $26 here and they are at 23.72. Thinking of buying more to get my buy in cost down. It’s gonna go back up eventually. Especially if you own them. Just have to wait.

A great year to fuck around and go big in both directions with risky trades. But, imo, the big winners for this year is anyone who bought the dip to hold forever for long term wealth. once in a lifetime opportunity :v (clearly i did not do this)
U think it eill rise by the 8th or after? Im thinking vix calls too

Their CRM is definitely good but it's a lot more limited then people think. I think they're mostly going to be hurt by trying to expand into areas that are not CRM. All it takes is one bad earnings for those puts to print especially when the company is being overvalued for their future growth
These must be the worst-rolled joints I have ever seen
Bag holding failing calls on a stock that’s banned on wsb is a special kind of pain it’s like being autistic & you’re not allowed to talk about it
You are literally trading minute candles, you cannot be gambling more than you're doing. You're trying to win 20% but can lose 100% and that'll wipe you out. This strategy could be alright in the hands of someone who DOESNT CHASE LOSSES and RISKS ONLY 2% PER TRADE and SETS STOP LOSS. In the hands of a noobie trader who is chasing 20% per trade in minutes (wtf) and is salty over his losses, it's not looking good.
Awesome will do. Cheers.

Fuck Robinhood and get another broker my dude. I like RH because it doesn't remind me of how smooth my brain is every time I try and YOLO and the snowflakes each morning are a nice backdrop for the red rollercoaster of a portfolio. There's other brokers with nice apps these days.

I’ll buy PLTR *after* the lockup period ends in Feb. Should be a decent dip.

There are 8,000 tickers easily available to most brokers.

Find one that fits your mentality.

It’s not about pegging all stocks and charts perfectly. It’s about finding the few stocks that you align with in a weird way that allows you to read it perfectly every time.

Today I bought 100x 0DTE QQQ a few strike points off trading price, for .06, sold for .11, it actually closed at .17.
Nobody tell him 🤫
💎👐
I am sitting here with sold puts (35$ Aug 2021). I do want my 1000 Palantir shares but I fear the premium is all I'll ever get for that trade.


Seeing this dip though, might be my first time in 2 years to throw some of my saved money into my brokerage.
Because tech is like a millennial and gives people cold feet when a stock booms and there isn't constant reassurance from the company that everything is amazing and they realize they went in hard on speculation of speculation. If you're confident either way, hold it my dude. I never boarded the PLTR train and I've got FOMO but I'm not ballsy enough to get on now.
Whose playing what next week. Whatre ur positions
I will . This sucks
Lol what are your grounds for this other than your own speculation
Your mom can barely write an email. What does the part about (unless it is) mean? Why does she capitalize words in the Middle of Sentences (unless it is)??

Non-troll post. I started 2 weeks ago and have lost $1.5k. Not that bothered as I'm still learning but obviously losses annoy you.   
Been FOMOing TSLA. 2 hours before close I saw it going up and down so thought I'd put a 12/31 695 put on it (I couldn't afford any of the calls). I think I immediately gained $200 after 4 minutes and sold. Did the same thing again 3 time and had pretty much made by all of my loses.   
Finally wanted to go big and went for a 685p with 1 hour left. This fucked me up and so did theta. Had a chance to breakeven with 30 minutes left but I didn't so ended up only making back $100 that day.  
My question is - with that kind of strategy (and obviously not being an idiot and going in 45mins before close) it seems good gains are possible. Same day expiring contracts are more affordable and I just have to set an automatic sell to take 20% profit as soon as that target hits.   
Is this something that I can repeat again without being stupid?  Is TSLA the only thing this really works for because it's volatile? And I'm right in thinking this should only be done on Fridays because 0 day contracts are cheaper.   
Happy New Year

Black market
I was up close to a 60% before putting my year end check into TSLA... now I am up 35%.
 Swung through the following:

Gains: 
CRSR, SPOT, TSLA, MRNA, 💩🪙

Losses:
I had PLTR at around 9 and sold at around 9, sold LDOS at loss (I am retarded), sold GME at loss (won’t do this again).

Did not do options, too pussy for this shit. Brought my balance from nothing to 16K. Its not much, but its all saving up and meme stonks.

Lost opportunities:
Did not buy enough MRNA at 28, waited like an idiot for TSLA quarter following the crash to turn to shit before buying (we all know what happened that quarter). NanoDimension was sold at 1.8 instead of holding until 6 or 7... 

Lessons:
I did not hold some positions long enough. In LDOS, I think I held too long and missed out in tech meme Stonks.
Nah the only thing I crash is my Pltr weeklys I’m damn good at flying in real life
I'm being serious here lol. You can do stocks/options/currencies/futures/commodities.

Where can I buy GME 100c?
This a completely wrong strategy. First we like numbers with red color. Second the chart should be with a negative slop. Finally, a loss is regarded as retarded. So this post is bad teaching material for wsb beginners.
This is retarded.
Gonna watch my slick RH earnings on the $KO calls I told you retards to buy. Definitely not tendie town but solid gains. Hoping for 160% return in 2.5 months and then considering long term strategy with GE. I guess I'm attracted to boomer stocks...

Earnings call premarket on a Thursday in a few weeks has me pumped for my 3/19/21 55c
Oh my, the confirmation bias here is getting out of hands. 

- Palantir is an old company, yet still has no path to profitability
- They forecasted revenues exceeding 1 billion multiple times in interviews yet it never materialized.
- They’ve not grown faster than their expenses, and likely never will (look at revenue vs loss and gross margins and compare to true „product“ tech companies).
- They try hard to make you think they’re a product company, but they are not. They do consulting, with a bit of software they‘ve used before.
- There are a million ways to connect multiple datasources, all of them require some manual labor. None of it is fancy, none of it is exciting. 
- I guarantee you Accenture can do everything palantir can do on the integration part, and openAi and alike can do everything regarding machine learning - just better.
- There is no secret sauce here.
- Trust and necessity outside the US is limited, and so is the market.

Im not saying Palantir has no place, but it’s place is not on the moon and you might discover that in 2021. ;)

I know it sounds depressing and it is.  For the last 3 years I've been throwing my money at shit until one week I lose like 10k.  I try again next year.  

If you keep trying, eventually you'll succeed (unless you're a gay bear).  If you decide to quit, thats fine too you're just back to normal life.

You threw all the money that you have onto this “bet”. You really are fucking retarded, if NIO has a stellar day (or if you’re up at all tbh) take your profits and run because everyone expect for you apparently knows goddamn well that that contract is going to expire worthless (0.06 gamma btw) while theta destroys your rectum. If for some remarkable reason NIO actually pulls through and does it and you diamond hand and make huge gains then congratulations, fuck you, you got super fucking lucky and you shouldn’t feel like you’re invincible because of it. This play is beyond retarded (due to the fact that you threw everything you own on it) and if anything shows me that you truly belong here. Let me know when you reach $0.00 (because based off of this you’ll get there soon enough), and don’t tell me I didn’t warn you.

And no. No sex.
Op, you made a really good analysis and I appreciate you taking the time to try to save us, but no, you 🌈🐻.

Your post assumes that a short squeeze can happen only under one condition: lack of liquidity. You say that 15 million of shares are traded every day of GME which means liquidity is just fine and they have nothing to worry about. But those may be the same shares circulating over and over, while Ryan, Sherman (since he can't sell his shares due to Ryan's stake) and us and possibly other players are bagholding. Overall, we have to have like 30% of shares combined.

 15m shares a day, 25% of the stock, is traded every day. Okay, great. But literally on any good news at all, GME will go up. A million scenarios can be favorable to GME, while only one benefits 🌈🐻: that GME will go bankrupt. Speaking of probability, on any good news, people will start to catch on, people will get in on the hype = less shares in circulation. The cycle will repeat. How are shorts supposed to cover 130%, paying daily interest, when 30% of shares and potentially more in the future are locked off, forever? Like 50%, 75% of shares at most can exchange hands on any given day but they can't cover everything since a large portion of people will just refuse to sell. Liquidity only goes so far without the price pumping.

Second of all, a short squeeze like VW is very unlikely to happen again, short of a miracle event. Why? Because people expect it. Maybe retail will buy into something that's likely to short squeeze but I doubt an institution doesn't remember the burn of VW. They will avoid it at all costs. By this logic, a short squeeze can only happen under different market conditions.


You sound intelligent, you analyse the market like a professional. Which means, hedge funds out there are staking it all on similar logic. They short GME because liquidity is high, so surely, for you guys, it can't be a repeat of VW. That's the gotcha. That's why nobody is panicking yet. And that's why GME actually has a chance to squeeze.


Anyway why do I bother typing this out though if noone on this sub can read


Tldr a short squeeze doesn't have to happen under the same market conditions as Volkswagen.

I mention this elsewhere but if you want a "cheap" GME squeeze play and you're late to the party, you can do:

> GME April 20c/35c debit call spread for about $2.7 each

Bit more details on the play [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kno2o3/daily_discussion_thread_for_december_31_2020/ghm3k51/)

Your break even is fairly low and we all know GME has touched $22 recently, so if Q4 #s really can squeeze and underlying stays around currently level come March, then this is a modest risk given the $35 commands so much premium while still being fucking 15+ pts OTM.

You have two options at expiry, exercise or let them expire worthless. But if you don't have the capital to exercise, then nothing you can do. 

That's why it's better to sell the option rather than exercise. The question I pose above is who actually ends up buying these contracts and exercising them, it would require a ton of capital.
What pt next year?
THUH
A solid analysis.

I wish OP would stop propagating these sentiments.

I appreciate that no-one wants to be going down with the ship but the idea is that you get off, not drag others down with you.

Until Canoo figures out its manufacturing woes and target market, it will likely continue to fall. If you're long, so be it - but why not make your profits elsewhere until this company shows some promise. (That said, it's your cash...)

Trying to get real life muscle gains. Been doing arm and leg workouts using dumbells for the past week or two. But every time I start lifting I just stop after a few weeks. Id like to make it a lifelong habit to lift every other day. Its not that hard, its just keeping the consistency to get results. My arms are tiny so I dont think it would take any longer than a year or 6 months to get noticeable results tbh. I just can't randomly stop and quit smh.

Yeah that's what I was thinking in terms of the amount of competitors already available in the markets for selling video games, merch, etc. Unless they bring something innovative capitalizing on the brand name, and going completely digital. Then use just the brick and mortar stores for PC, playstation, nintendo etc repairs/purchases and other things as well I can't think of at the moment. It'll be tough but getting in before somehow a miracle happens, I wouldn't want to miss that.

Unsure. It'll have a Kodak-type squeeze, but I'm not sure. I've heard 50/share, which sounds about right, but it'll fly past 150 if the squeeze actually happens before correcting itself. 

I think Cohen could potentially pull a miracle, and I fully believe he has a plan to squeeze the stock aka "increase shareholder value," but there's no room for it with everything being digital and done through Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, or Steam.
So what did you sell the 2620 PLTR shares you bought at the *very* top at 29.74 whilst telling everyone on this sub to hold or buy more?

I’m 100% sure they hit the 500k target. I just considered they were sandbagging the projections by under promising and over delivery. Id set up a type a of straddle/strangle.
> Just because the company is profitable doesn't mean the people buying stonks will buy.

I have to disagree. just because some stocks can fly on speculation doesn’t mean companies who are incredibly profitable are just forgotten about, someone always finds your papers in this game. By thinking profits don’t matter you’re forgetting about a *massive* portion of institutions who invest based on fundamentals
What's interesting is most of this strategy wouldn't be possible because in 1990 it would've cost you like $50 to buy $1 worth of stock and zero-commission trading is new.

THIS IS MY QUANT
Not enough GME shares to move the price. Cohen is about to buy more pretty soon, so April calls would cover any big movements, I'm trying to time the floor

nahh, get GME shares or a DIS 270c 1/22/22 !
Yes I'm surprised more people don't realize it.  They block blue/violet wavelength laser radiation which most consumer grade laser engravers emit.

I've Been Stimmi-lated!💦🤑
Anyone going all in on tesla puts for next week? To beat q3 records and hit the 500k target tesla would need to have done 40k more in deliveries, with the resurgence of covid in q4 and its variant strain + European lockdown and competition ramp up, I believe it’s difficult to hit that target.

Whats more that the risk reward is extremely good so long as you play the right call am thinking 620p 01/15, if tesla beat, its already at ath and the loss will not be bad but if it doesn’t I expect a drop back to the 620 lvl we touched on the 22nd.
Same here. Hopped in on it a few days ago and was up 34% for the first 45 minutes, now I'm down 87% lmao. Bout buy back in when markets open though
C’mon bro make it challenging at least

PLTR to $100 if Biden dies pre-market on the 4th
[TSLA vs Burry and the shorts](https://youtu.be/VckDBuZCMA0)
Yeah, I'll hold until 26-27 at least. And sell CCs.

Just hope it won't take a year.
Is it safe to assume this will go up the next few days?
Holding APHA 1/8 8.5c for this exact reason.
My new years resolution is to lose more money
So you buy options, but have you ever thought who you buy them from? 

Me. I sell options. And seeing how most options expire worthless for the buyer, I typically make money.
Some people got it yesterday and the day before, give it until next Tues, according to Mnuchin
Hmm, let's say for the first time I see it under 20.

But yeah I'm holding and selling 15% OTM CCs
You mean like fuckin leap year, idiot coders
Is it safe to assume this will go up the next few days?
I’m down $23k. I’ll have to donate when I’m up
You are the worst type of holder.

Stock is dipping so big money can get back in.

Lots of close call interest is making them interested in keeping it down.

Just hold, say nothing and it'll be fine.
Maybe. But at the end of the bull run that 10% is often not enough to be in the money for a lot of the bets people make.  

"It's up over 200% in the last 3 months. Surely I can milk out another 12% in the next week."
If you make a call for 710 and it goes to 714 is it good that its over your call? or do you not want that?
GOEV, GNOG, RMO
You won't mind when you sell for 300k instead of 900k?
I honestly have no clue. I thought it wasn't but everyone is acting as if it will be. I am confused
"Posted this for the bitches..."

Just like a poor person with money would. Are you beginning to understand yet?
lost most of my vxx calls, but still having fun with families and friends in the ski cabin, happy new year fellas
Ah your caption is misleading. Good luck sir
It won't clear til probably Tuesday but the funds will be in my account to at least get shares of something. either way, YESSSSS
Just bought more shares. PLTR on sale today.
I'm writing 69 checks in the amount of $69.69 for 2021
Just because the company is profitable doesn't mean the people buying stonks will buy. Remember, everyone in the market has the big dumb. I expect this business to blow up once the dumbs think the pandemic is over, but until then, I'm staying away from it.
Thank you for being retarded and it comforts me. I hope we both will do good in 2021
Sorry I'm a complete pleb but what exactly is your strat then if you don't buy options
Uhhh I didn’t have to.. but I have amazon prime ? Idk
Incredible analysis thanks. You are too professional for this sub.

bro you're fucked sorry man
Congrats man keep it up

Great bro at least you did not loose more than you had. I went from 20k to 195k to 30k to 129k to 50k to 90k to 3k to -200k ( last was borrowed as it was margin )
You mirin brah
$1k per week in CCs, more or less. 

I just hope some day I'll recoup my losses.

Thanks for this tip!
Wheres the TLDR??
> No way anyone sees ultra expensive spa merch to be profitable even in a thriving non-pandemic economy.

except for the fact that they’ve been profitable for years and growing revenues by almost 50% per year with 38% CAGR on EBITDA from 2016-2019

Their margins are fantastic. You think Saunders is running a charity or is clueless as to how to make a profit in this industry? he knows what he’s doing and this company was literally his first choice

I bought puts in March.....
[deleted]
Idk man sounds like a high number. Do you know math?
In this sub? I'll lurk around on posts sorted by new to see if anyone shakes some fruit from a tree. I'll check out a lot of suggestions to see if anything looks interesting. Rarely does it happen but it at very least keeps me up to date on some positions and companies I've never heard of. Every now and then I'll see something interesting and buy a few shares just to keep an eye on it. If it goes up I'll buy more. People will suggest all sorts of wild shit around here but Ive got a certain percentage of my portfolio I'll gamble with. 

One of the most recent mentions in WSB I bought in on is Bill Ackman's SPAC ($PSTH). I saw it mentioned for the first time in November in the daily post thread. Made a small buy and been adding to my position for weeks. I've seen it mentioned a little bit more the past few weeks around here. I've already made some money but expect him to do something fantastic with his $5.5b SPAC. I'm not necessarily hyping it but just saying I bought it after learning of it in this sub. I think that's the best current risky gamble I'm aware of. 

Besides Tesla, I've rarely seen much of what's mentioned frequently in the top posts of the day be of much value. It's usually already made it's move by the time the meme posts come out. I think there are a lot of great, well connected traders who lurk around here like me looking for diamonds in the rough but they just make subtle comments or text posts that don't get a ton of attention. 

Outside of this sub I'm keeping my ear to the ground all over. I'll keep CNBC on in the background all day to see if they mention anything interesting. I find their reporting to be a good barometer of overall market sentiment and  moods of investment banks and the hedge fund world. It's hard to really. I'll also keep an eye on the whales to see what kinda of moves they are making. I'd say im most likely to make a few transactions after [skimming around on this site.](https://dataroma.com/m/home.php) 

It stands to reason that the WSB content creators are kids who spend a majority of their free time fucking around with memes for Reddit Karma rather than doing stock homework for money. And that's what gets upvoted.

I’ve made a lot the past few months. With 18k in cash, I consistently made about 1.5-2k every 2 weeks. What’s great about it is I don’t have to pay attention to the stock and tend to it as much. Buying options requires hawk like micromanaging and that brings a lot of stress.

Lol the fact that stocks went "bat shit this year" would have been the reason you'd be out of a home right now
with penny junior mining stocks, the price can build up in anticipation to results. so many novice investors especially if gold shoots up and attracts a lot of attention. then you sell right before the results get released, and the price crashes, even if the results are good. its hilarious.

now if the results are spectacular, then it could moon, thats the catch

What good is making 100-200k on a trade if you never take profits? He was aggressive when he had to, landed a great trade but got too greedy when he had something to protect and lost it all.

Nothing wrong with making risky bets if you have little to lose, but yoloing your entire portfolio after making that much money is dumb, and he paid the stupid tax for it.

These gme posts wreak of desperate hope...
I bought Apple and Microsoft 2022 Leaps in march, after one week, i was down already 15 percent. sold them in May and rolled over into the same Leaps but with higher strike prices. 

The profits are about twice what would have been with stonks. So nothing near 1000 percent or anything what weekly traders see from time to time.

The most difficult is not selecting the Leaps, it s having cash when market is at the bottom.
Wow whats up your butt

I already bought GME at about the current price (basically the fucking peak) pre last earnings and lost faith as I watched it fall, sold for a loss and moved on. Then watched it jump 30% in like 3 days. After reading this and all the posts I'm actually finding myself considering an even more significant buy. I think I'm truly becoming autistic now, considering buying the same stock again that I just sold for a loss after it jumps back up, I feel like if buy and it loses again I might need medication

OPEN THE MARKET, DO IT YOU WONT
Been holding calls. Interested to see where this ends up on Jan 7 and if it has as much volatility as Tesla did. Doubt it can but it has been on a lot of peoples radar lately especially with Biden coming in and the float isn’t very high

+29%. Mostly from Stillfront and Evolution Gaming.

A short is essentially just a borrowed share. Someone borrows the share and sells it, but now imagine the next guy does the same thing and it keeps repeating untill the same share has been borrowed and sold several times.

Think of it in terms of a baseball card or something. I lend it to you, you sell it with the promise to return it later. Now the guy you sold it to lends it to his friend who does the same thing. There is only one card but it has been sold by multiple people and it must be bought back by the borrower's and returned back up the chain to the original owner. 

I'm seeing about 98.5% of outstanding shares currently short. It's been over 100% in the past and while strange it is  completely possible

This is the first new years i spent alone drinking in bed and watching tv 

Can’t wait for my vaxx so my life can be normal-ish again
Okay why nov 2021?
Nowadays those whippersnappers are on the ClickClack and the FacePage and the Backspace, they'll videotape you mid-prank

Gross. There is michelin, and then there are people trying to save money because they don't like driving.

If you wear nicer glasses, or get contact lenses,  you’d look better IMO.

Don’t love the beard either. But you’re not a bad looking guy honestly.
Things learned from last year. Buy calls on anything with a P/E of 300-10,000. Buy calls whenever bad news is released. Buy calls when hopes of something is in the air. Buy puts when sell the news events happen. Buy calls during every covid surge. SPY and covid cases have a 98% direct correlation.

Lol, whenever there is a consumer need for the optics they create for sniper rifle scopes and pilot HUD's they'll be off to the races.  Maybe Tesla will give rich idiots a helmet that let's the see through their cars.

Right now projections show that like 2028 is their year.
it's gonna be a tough race to the bottom, but i have faith in us
Played Starcraft and wrote some software. But mainly Starcraft.
Yeah, I'm torn.

My long term bet is that this is worth way more than $30.

CGC for those 2020 tendies
I need 2021 to pump RKT
I also sold nvda, googl, and msft within a day or two of the bottom. Got it all back and then some with a watchlist i called "evil on the cheap" that was ba, ccl, and a bunch of other stupid garbage in summer, sold that at the peak, and then got into palantir, chargepoint, and uber for a retard strength finish.

> NFLX tries to go after Brazilian dollars with latin shows

Gives them a show set in Mexico and where they speak Spanish, doesn't realize it for YEARS.

> DIS goes after China with an "accurate" Mulan

Gets literally everything wrong to the point it pisses off China because they did ZERO DD on the movie, and opened the door to Winnie the Pooh opening a can of whoop ass on the Mouse.

> Sony buys Crunchy Roll and goes after Latin America with an "authentic" Mesoamerican Anime

Same problem as Mulan, but this time they didn't even do a 5 minute Wikipedia search for their story and pissed off not only their fanbase of Weebs, but the Latinos they were trying to buy their service.

Its like these companies are working hard to lose their money faster than WSB.

GME
It's patience, you retard.
Yum, those GME calls are delicious.
Remember to save enough bud for morning hangover bowl. Also remember stonks go 📈
There is truly zero risk below $10 on pre-merger SPACs. 

PTY basically is junk bonds, and it dropped over 50% in March. I'm legit talking about buying SPACs right at 10 or a few pennies over,  that can be redeemed for 10.
Then fuck her online bf too
I learned selling cash secured puts are the optimum combination of not being a 🌈🐻 and still dicking around with options without giving all your money away.

Thank you! My goal was just to smoke a bunch before New Years. Not give it as an offering to Jesus.
Duke, like mayo?  Cover her in mayo?  I get it now.
Honestly I don’t think I would tell my boss. I mean it is a pretty sketch story and makes your life sound unstable. Also you just never know how a boss might view things even if you think you know him. I would keep it to the professionals and family. Imo just get through work tomorrow and then sit down with your parents and really talk it through. Most important thing is just to distance yourself from the guy as much as you can. That could include finding a new place.

They take in a gross profit of 800mil but have an operating expense of 2.3bil. They have to be paying people insane amount of money or something, I dont get it and can't find info on it. A bit disappointed because it seems like it could be good and women like it especially as they are turning away from other social media.
this is a picture of my life
They always are.. in my hood they stop you if they don't recognize your vehicle- truly fucked.  I tell my friends before they visit to drive straight and sure enough.

These people would have a better investment in getting teeth pulled

Lol it's safe but ok
Not originally my thesis, but I believe it: institutional ownership won’t happen until after lockout. There aren’t enough shares available to take a significant position without driving up the price prematurely. After lockout, institutions will scoop up shares. We’ll know they are done when big houses initiate coverage with price targets. I would expect a price drop around lockout end, some consolidation, and then steady rises through end of year. Skipping the IPO short circuited the usual big brokerage paydays. We can benefit, but we’ve got to keep eyes on the prize. 4Q and 1Q21 earnings reports will determine if we are right. If so, never sell.

Position: added 2K shares Thursday. 7K total.
Gme is a shit stonk but if you believe in it dont get calls that will expire worthless, get paid to sell puts and take delivery like the 💎🙌 autists you are.
This is pretty much loss porn.

Canoo on sale right. Buy the dip, lower your avg. You'll be happy you held through '21, the best year of your life.
this is the way
Okay and I turned $10k into $50k in less than half that. The thing about cooked books is that nobody gives a fuck about it until it gets discovered with proof. Until then the music is going to play. Overall I don't see any reason for it to decline besides it's correlation with BABA and the overall market. There's a high number of shares short on this. If you are so confident open a $1M short.
Seems like the people that start it get stuck in the growth phase, and don't understand how to monetize it.

Pin of all things should be fucking easy to do.

Like of someone posts a sweater, there should be a way to click through to the actual product on the vendors website. Have the vendor pay referrals and then you making bank without compromising the user experience.

Turn the website into a style shopping book.
Every girl I met from online dating was awesome.  Got laid way more often.  Ended up marrying one from match.com

Be yourself.  If you think you're writing dumb shit then you're doing it wrong.  Unless your real personally is fake as fuck, too, in which case you're just going to be unhappy forever and no amount of hitting on drunk girls will fill the hole in your soul.
Sounds like you need some cocaine bro.
Move out ASAP.
Happy New Years to all of you. I hope you all realize your gains next year
Yes, ok I guess that’s a broad way to say that’s one of the things I’ve learned. I see the correlation with these particular stocks, so now this is how I’m taking advantage of it. But it’s important for me to not just hold these forever. I hit my % gain I want, and get out. I think that as time goes on, that % gain I’m looking for will go down because of the opportunity cost.
Average is closer to 9.8%. That ~7% is supposed to be accounting for inflation.  

Though that 9.8% is accounting for bear market years too, during a bull market the return is obviously higher than 10% to compensate for the down years.
Dont give in to the pattern youve fallen into, the more you repeat having “bad luck” the more it solidifies the synapses... try righting down all the good things that happened in the last day or week, draw your attention away from the bad.. i know, i been there too.
More loss porn for all of us in the new year🙏🏾🙏🏾🙏🏾
I know it sucks ass having a crush on that chick and not being able to smash, but if you really value her friendship and shit, just keep her around. Don’t simp tho. Sometimes relationships ruin what was once a good friendship. So yeah just keep her around as a friend, and pipe some tinder thots no strings attached. You get the best of both worlds
Bitches like playing with the nice guy friend.  It's fucked.  If it's meant to happen it will but odds are it won't.  Forget her- Delete her from your phone.  If she initiates then you can try again but beyond that..  
But for real leave it alone.
Here you go
Went -18k with credit card and options experimentation. Cured 🌈 🐻 derangement syndrome and went long with tsla. Used heloc to enter position. Lord Elon blessed me enough money to settle credit card and heloc debt. Entering 2021 with 60 tsla shares and no debt. Feels good.

How the fuck do you talk to a girl every day you want to date **for 9 months** and not let her know you want her like that
FYI even dependents get $600 it’s not much but it’s something... hope everything gets better for you man. Also definitely file for PUA, it’s a lot easier to qualify for than normal unemployment.
Yeah I plan on telling my boss at work, he’s a pretty laid back and understanding guy and knows I’m a hard worker. So hopefully he can help me out

My prediction is a slight dip for maybe a week but then institutions, realizing that this is the best opportunity to claim their stake, will jump in and it will finally start growing steadily past $30.

Why is drunk so fun
Lol yeah I was up 350% on $200 over the course of 2.5 years with apple, Netflix and Disney stocks. 

Decided to unload savings into options and after a wild ride I’m barely up 10% for the year.
My normie friend told me this is the only sub he gets memes from so I followed and I don't understand 99% of this Shit. Happy New years retards.
Fuck bros, was talking to this girl for over 9 months day in and day out, literally wasn’t a day that we didn’t talk. When i finally mustered up the confidence to ask her out she said she only sees me a as a friend. Left me heartbroken. Hadn’t seen her in over a week and i went to drink with a few friends tonight and i saw her there. She had makeup on and she looked as cute as ever. Just when i thought i was over her all these memories came flooding back into my mind. I drank a shit ton and right when i got home, this girl texts me a happy birthday message. I really wanna reply but i don’t want myself to get attached again
Introvert checking in.
If you like bowing down to a bunch of silly bitches.  You fucked in the head fam.  I'm literally embarrassed some of the shit I've written to women online.

Thanks!  I'll read those too!  I didn't even think about glassdoor.
Online dating is actually the best
If you need to talk let me know, I don't understand but I can listen.
Guns have no place in a college house man what a bad trip. Fuck what a creep. Kid should absolutely lose his gun license but idk if I would even want to get involved like that. Sounds like it obvs wasn’t your fault but def move in groups and keep your eyes peeled for the next month. What a lame situation and scary situation to get caught up in. I would see a counselor to talk the experience out, just keep it super broad and say you want to talk about a traumatic experience or come up with a similar but made up story so they don’t go reporting things you don’t want them to. But I would definitely consider talking to someone about it. Just my two cents.

Finally getting home. I'm fucking beat from work. 

With 2020 finally behind us and 2021 here, I just wanna say these last few years have sucked for me, and I'm not sure if 2021 looks much better. But one thing I am going to try to do is control what I can control and just try my damnest to play the shit cards I been dealt. I've wasted damn near a decade of my life because I've had a really hard time accepting the way stuff has played out in my life. It's just eaten away at my soul and ability to find joy in anything. I don't think that's gonna change, but I'm gonna try my best to just start one good habit and go from there. 

I hope 2021 is the yr where you can overcome all of your obstacles and demons. Most importantly, I hope it's the year where your portfolio sees postive gains and leads you closer to whatever your financial goals are. 

Last but not least, thank you for making 2020 manageable r/wsb. I know for a fact I would have gone bat shit crazy without this sub, and I'm very thankful for everyone on it and all the positive interactions on here. There's some very caring and intelligent people here and I appreciate you all. Here's to us kicking ass and making gains in 2021 🍻🍻🍻🍻
What will be the Tesla of 2021?
I like that
that was fun! can we do it again this March? Same time?
Most people who invest diversify their portfolio so that they don’t lose large amounts of money if something wrong happens with the stock they have. Even here, people get a little bit of this, a little bit of that, get some FD’s every once in a while, maybe some monthlies. I’m new, I started trading in April. I have significantly increased my initial deposits, I’ve learned many strategies and what to use them for, and now, I see this opportunity with this particular strategy and I want to be fully committed to it in 2021.

Don’t be intimated by this idiot and file a police report. It really doesn’t matter if you’re in college, I’ve gotten into some serious shit with my roommates and nobody has pulled a weapon even when possible.
You're out of your fucking mind to be ANYWHERE NEAR a situation like that. Cut the gangrene out ASAP and move 100 miles away from them.
You motherfuckers are always on fire. Why would you light fireworks?

Oh it def does.  I bought a penny years ago when I beyond retarded.  I legit believed it would moon.
I was I think 28 when I got the call from my friend telling me had lymphoma. We went to high school together, college together, were college roomates, met up to go to college and NFL football games together.

He didn't respond to treatment. I only knew this because our friends told me. When we talked we only discussed the jets because we're both fans because I thought it would take our mind off things. I would get texts from his roomate for not being supporting enough, sucked. Nothing was working.

He got his sperm saved for his girlfriend, went onto an experimental tremant and responded incredibly well. All of us moved to the west coast and enjoyed thanksgiving in Sonoma with a mutual friend. Tried to spend the holidays together this year but the risk was too high.

Things can work out. Don't feel selfish, it's a lot to handle, it's a lot of emotion. it comes in waves

I don’t think it’s entirely stupid (short squeeze plus corporate takeover eminent) but I do think at $20 people missed the boat. If you weren’t in at $10-12, then you should have stayed out.
Once you start understanding the basic building blocks of flavors and what your friends/family like, it's over. So easy to take a protein, add a carb, add a veggie and just keep building flavors you know go well together and you like together.
We need to get people checked out man! A lot of unstable people running around carrying guns! Shouldn’t be as easy to get your hands on them imo. Here in Kansas you don’t even need a background check. It’s kinda fucked.

Glad you’re safe man. Really sucks that you had to experience that.

Then they are doing it slightly wrong, imo. Especially the last 9 months, most securities are tightly correlated anyway, so why not focus yourself.
How will China suppress it? They make shitty steel that most companies dont want. Compare the MT stock prices from now to 2008, and we are in a pretty similar situation with high demand/ limited supply and rising steel prices. Trust the dd, or dont.

I feel like such a dumbass. I started the year with a ton of capital and ended up 5% after wild, stressful swings throughout the year trading options. Meanwhile my cousin bought AAPL stock in April and made over 100%. 🤡 

Lesson learned, buy the fucking dip and hold
and pop a snus or two
Shares can be redeemed for the NAV if no merger is made. Warrants have no NAV, and can become worthless. But they can also see humongous gains - see QS warrants. I bought into them when they were $1 and I just sold for $41.
What what in the butt
When I was about 8 years old I received this plastic toy sword from my grandmother. It was a pretty cheap one, but awesome looking enough.

Anyways, so I get out of the house and start playing with it outside.
At one point I held it up in the air and pointed it to the sky yelling “Let there be RAIN!”, and I swear on my life it did in like 30 seconds.

Being confused, but still unconvinced, I tried it again yelling “RAIN STOP!” and the rain stopped.

At this point my 8 years old brain had all the evidence it needs to truly believe I could control the weather with this sword.
I was absolutely terrified. Just too much responsibility.

I ended up smashing the sword on the ground, ran upstairs and started crying in a badly lit room. 

100% true story
I hate saying this because I am a gun advocate, but this really swayed me the other way and we need more regulation
A lot of ATMs only give out 20s.
Say the magic word.
Yeah that’s how I see it as well. In order I’d say:

1) 401k up to match
2) Roth max
3) HSA max 
4) 401k max

One thing I wanna add for HSA is that it rolls over year to year and if you don’t spend it, you can withdrawal it exactly like a Roth at 65. So if you have HSA, I’d treat it like a Roth, it’s a great option
It should be free to cater to those bitches

Everyone here does not use 75-100% of their portfolio to buy one stock. Only some do, that I’ve seen

I know and accept the risks, but by doing it with SPAC’s, they’re considerably less than with normal stocks. Also, it will take a bit of the right chart setup, the right target, and obviously timing, to work. All of which I’ve been pretty successful at this year, and I’m comfortable now throwing in much larger amounts.
Soros has invested millions into PLTR the NWO is on our side here
If they go below $10 you can still redeem for $10 prior to the merger. Idgaf if it underperforms the market, I just need more than 2% on cash- equivalents and this should be a simple 10-20% annually.

Pls enlighten us about how the Hui stay in china's good graces.
Some points I want to make on this discussion:

1. TSLA is not necessarily undervalued. You can't really say they're overvalued either. If tesla can't launch their robotaxi network, then yes, it would be way over valued with it's 2024 price target being $500-680. But retail investors are betting that it can. Here's the main point though: Tesla is not an automotive company. It is an autonomous driving software/AI + robotics + transportation + Energy company. Calling Tesla an automotive company is like calling apple a mp3 manufacturing company during thier iPod days (disregarding iTunes sales) and calling them a phone manufacturing company like samsung, blackberry, or nokia after their iPhone was launched (disregarding their app store, services, and accessories sales and their high profit margins per iPhone sales). Or calling amazon merely an online book store when they are really an eCommerce platform and so much more. Valuing growth companies are next to impossible. For example, Apple's stock since 2008 (year the iPhone was released) to 2019 has gained over 1200%. If apple stock in 2008 skyrocketed 500% to a fourth of its 2019 price, everyone would have called it crazy. And that is literally what is going on with tesla stock right now. Tesla's potential 2030 market cap with 20 mln per year vehicle sales + full self driving robotaxi network (discarding the fact that tesla will expand its business to full self driving subscription service, TSLA insurance, solar city etc) is estimated to be valued at 2-10+ Trillion dollars in market cap (look up [ARK invest's research](https://ark-invest.com/articles/analyst-research/tesla-price-target/) although this price target was before the 5:1 split. Price target is $3-4.4k if they solve full self driving and robotaxi network). The only difference between apple, amazon and this time is that the with the advent of the internet, information has been democratized and retail investors have caught onto this undervalued asset early. They can clearly see that TSLA is going to be huge. Do NOT short or buy puts on Tesla. You will only lose money. Tesla shareholders are not your typical investors - they are fanboys, or strong believers... call it what you want. They will never sell their shares until 2030+. I'd be willing to bet they hold around 20+% of TSLA. These are people who've spotted the potential of TSLA and have been HODLing TSLA way before 2018. Also, with the S&P 500 inclusion a multitude of index funds and foreign funds now hold a large position in TSLA. These funds CANNOT sell their shares no matter what with institutional ownership of TSLA now being over 40%. Insiders also hold 20% of TSLA. With that being said, I can't see TSLA drop below 550 tbh. Before the S&P 500 inclusion maybe. Now it's quite hard for the stock to drop that low imo.

2. There has been so much disinformation on TSLA. "The competition is coming", "Tesla's vehicles are being sold at a loss and they are losing money", "The only reason TSLA made a profit is due to tax credits", "Elon Musk is a fraud and a poor CEO", "TSLA doesn't have the technology", "Nobody wants an electric car", "Tesla vehicles have massive issues", "Demand is falling for TSLA"... all of which are insanely misleading and untrue. I suspect a lot of these personalities that come on TV are paid by either big oil or traditional ICE vehicle companies. Yeah. You've basically been brainwashed by TV into straying away from TSLA. Anyone who is read up on TSLA knows not to short this company. If you want to know details about these, follow youtube channels like "[Solving the Money Problem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BWt3AY8CEjY)"

Im not the only one chasing that weekly random magic.
One of my roommates decided to absolutely disrespect and put down my other roommates girlfriend and made her cry while he was out of town. So stuck up for her and urged him to apologize, which he refused to by further putting her down. I throw pizza and water at him as he went on. We start yelling at each other and he pulls out his gun and turns off the safety and puts his finger on the trigger then points it at me threatening to shoot me. I can’t stop thinking about it and have to get it off my chest. This happened about 3 hours ago what a way to finish 2020

Never let them pick who does the work. They will use whoever does it the cheapest. That goes for any insurance company. They’re “preferred shops” are just shops they’ve made a deal with to do the work as cheap and as fast as possible. Find out which shop near you that the insurance companies hate. That’s the one you want fixing your car.
Ok so how

Can’t make more than 3 daytrades unless you have at least 25k in your account.

Silly rule imo
How do you get your $10 per share of it goes below 10 and can you get the money if you buy warrants?
someone already brought up the fact that you can get to a million with 20 percent gains on less than 40 trades earlier in the thread

the reality is going all-in on every trade is suicidal risk management, and getting 20% on 37ish consecutive trades is near impossible, if you start taking any losses at all you'll start to need to get 25... 35% on the next trade to make up the loss, suddenly you start chasing.

the top-upvoted thread on WSB is a great example of how this "strategy" can blow up on you quickly.

I'm sorry to hear that. Given I touched $11,500 at one point from a $600 initial investment only to have nothing to really show for it except bad trades and some air pods, it hurts looking back on it. It'll be alright, you'll make it back though this month.
I’m so desensitized at this point I just don’t care anymore, number go up number go down nobody can explain that
How did you know my name was Mat?
This is really good to know, thanks. One of the main reasons ive stuck with state farm is because I thought they would be good to work with in case of a repair. 

I will say i wasnt too pleased with their choice in glass shop when i had my windshield replaced over the summer. Did a crap job around the windshield seal itself and got some of that black gunky sealant on my leather drivers seat. I was so pissed.

Dont give up on me yet.  After spending a year of making every wrong decision, I felt really embarassed I was going to have to report that loss on my tax return.  With 2 weeks to go in the year, a miracle happened and I actually gained 32k in a single week (24k of that came in a single day).  https://ibb.co/mqCXX8R

I'm back to 25k minus 3k for taxes and I now appreciate this money alot more now after losing it.  This time I'm going to put it to good use

What’s hilarious is that just about any data scientist (someone who *actually* knows about statistical inference, you know, maybe someone who’s even coded in R—or do you not know what that is?), they’ll tell you the same shit I’m telling you.

This Is the gayest shit I’ve seen all day...
That’s why I’m thinking of just after LOI. Then, you aren’t going in blindly, and the “pattern” begins. The price spikes immediately, and comes back down again near NAV, where the buying starts and the price increases pretty steadily - if it’s a worthwhile or interesting target. Just what I’ve seen the last few months. Also, because of this, and how easy it is to profit off of these SPAC’s, I think there will be a relatively limited time to capitalize on this SPAC boom we experienced this year.
I don’t know if I’m gonna make it, but I’m gonna keep trying and trying
I believe in you.

Have u ever pleasured a man sexually before ?
To be fair its been a couple insurance cycles since i shopped around. But at that time there was nothing I cpuld find that was more than like 3-5% cheaper so it didnt seem worth switching.

Then over the summer they offered a fat discount of like 15-20% due to covid so now I really havent shopped around lol. And I think I forgot that the 70 also includes like 11 bucks for renters insurance
still better than most people on this sub

All we do
The other way around if you bought TSLA
I like this idea. Very executable. Most seem to make 100%, but if not that at least 50%. With each successive SPAC the pie gets bigger so the percentage becomes less important. How are you tracking these?

Nothing will happen. Biden will be president. The media wants to drum up the civil war narrative because Trump is now on the way out and holds less appeal to viewers. Basically, he’s now old news. Do not fall victim to this propaganda, as you merely perpetuate their narrative if you do.

Probably some Company in a more mundane industry like the next Domino’s Pizza that currently only has 1 location
Anyone here use the strategy of going all in on one stock on a dip, then pulling out after a certain percentage gain, rinse and repeat? Making buys and sells daily to weekly? I think 2021 I’ll be doing that with near NAV SPAC’s or right after LOI’s are released. Maybe keep a couple thousand out to play with fd’s if the time arises. I want to be strict, and follow the plan. How many SPAC’s went 100% this year weeks, and in succession? One after the next? Quite a few. And even more so for warrants, where I’ve been getting much more than 100% return on them, even before news drops for them. It takes 11 trades to get to $1M from $1,000. I’ll start with around $25k. I don’t think I’ll roll over 100% of the trade into the next, but continue buying more shares that I’ll want to hold long term, so far that’s been SQ, PLTR, and CRSP. Maybe I’ll make update posts throughout the next few months on here.

Bro, I pay $90 a month for 2 trucks for me and a 2015 Avalon for my 19 yo daughter with full coverage. I wouldn’t call your rates reasonable.

Edit: I’m wrong. It was $90 a month before I added her. It’s $150 now.
Do your own dd before buying in. That being said, I think he's legit. I'm pretty confident in MT
What's your point? And why is it "le redditor" to be concerned about your dog's stress level?
Lol maybe it will burst if it is a bubble in the first place, maybe it will go higher maybe it will go down a little bit. But dont try to hurt elon.
Is the market open tomorrow?
Yes sir hahah I worked the 9pm to 6am pre covid I was banking

Or they're buying new cars which cost way more to insure and I dont think most people realize that when they purchase it
A lot of people are giving out insane "predictions" of PLTR going up 100x or more over the next 10 years.


If PLTR went up 100x...it would be worth 4.4 trillion dollars (2x AAPL)


What stocks/industries can you see going up 100x over the next 10 years? I can see the genomics industry going nuts if they can get over major hurdles. Space also, but there aren't many stocks in that area right now (other than SPCE)
how about this

yeah 20% on 37 consecutive trades going all-in with your entire portfolio on each trade.

look at top-upvoted thread on WSB currently to see how that approach usually ends.

The difference per weekly pay check between 60k and 100k is about $400. Seems like a lot, but you start spending more due to lifestyle inflation. 2 100k incomes it makes a big difference, but if you’re single, after the initial honeymoon period of the income jump, it will still seem like you’re not making enough.

About 70 bucks / month for my 10 year old Honda accord with full coverage thru state farm. No accidents in 10 years and no tickets for about 5 years.

People seem to talk about how expensive state farm is but my rates with them have always been reasonable. I think those people are just bad drivers

happy new year bro!

Not necessarily. And you can actually buy and sell weekly options several weeks in advance. There aren’t weeklies for those weeks in which a normal monthly contract would expire.
Oh my god I’m legit laughing so hard. I’m sorry but oh my god this post was hilariously executed. No one can take away the entertainment you bring bro
Honestly.... look at almost every chart this year. 

You’d have been really smart to chain buy all the way down on so many of these. 

Some not lol but still. At least this time it meant nothing after like 5 weeks for so many companies.
Happy New Year retards...may the tendies keep on flowing in the new year.
33 % up since October.
Just SPACs. 

30% of capital allocated after DA, with the vote run up. Always sell at the merger.

70% purchase near NAV with great teams. Have few position here that pops every once in a while.

Posts like these make me feel better about  bagholding PLTR at 29 and GME at 19
I am pretty sure that is has been pretty much the last decade. Dont quote me on it. Anyway, the point is no one reliably beats the market by picking stocks. There may be a lucky few, but neither you nor me or anyone else on here wont beat it. So its better to just stick with index fund investing. You can get some alpha with allocating your funds into smart beta strategies. That has been well documented.

As far as I know he used to beat the market, but recently he has lagged the market. Also his alpha has been explained away by exposure to various risk factors (smart beta) like small and value stocks.

Not true. Literally the Wikipedia pages have been completely rewritten to say that’s where the first reports came from. Back in March it said it came from Chinese immigrant workers in Europe.

GME bear here, but I gotta admit, focusing on PC is a smart move. PC Master Race will never disbanden. Would take of lot revamping though, people are super selective when buying parts for their PCs, so they will need to rebuild their inventory manahement system completely, because atleast before the pandemic they were stuffing all the stores and storeroom with merchandise that couldn't easily be sold causing space issues. Ofcourse this doesn't affect online sales.

It was me
If I have 1000 contracts that are in the money by 3 cents, but there's no liquidity for them, I have to exercise to get the contracts in order to keep my $3000 in the money. I imagine many of these contracts end up being not exercised since it's likely prohibitively expensive to exercise for the owner of the option contracts. If I'm a MM with enough cash/leverage, I could exercise, sell the shares and make the $3000 profit. But I guess maybe that's not worth it if say the strike is $10 and you'd need to pony up $1M to exercise, for a 0.3% return.
Mind. Blown.

Yes that’s true. There are 6 major suppliers right now. 

At the end of 2021 SK hynix is due for regulatory approval to acquire Intels NSG (NAND business). This means the industry will consolidate getting closer to the 3 supplier oligopoly which is DRAM today.

Basically we were supposed to go to this crazy bar that was playing a rather hyped up football game for our university, I went to a Chipotle to meet up with her after I was done tailgating and she texted me after 30 minutes of waiting saying she changed her mind. The worst part was that I could’ve gotten into the stadium and watched in person if she hadn’t texted so late

That’s nice and everything, but consider that the rest of those stores are profitable. I hate to keep sucking Cohen’s load into my mouth but if an e-commerce outlet dedicated to pets can exist and thrive with much lower margins than GameStop. That is the compelling thesis. Blockbuster is irrelevant. The question is can GameStop exist in the niche collectible/hobby gaming market. Those that collect their disks and special editions aren’t going away. Those that hold their collection of games and prefer the physical format aren’t going away.
Still haven't read this bullshit. Fuck you

It never should be all or nothing, especially if you have no fucking clue what you are doing.  If you are up that much sell half and let half ride.  If it goes up again big time do the same again.  For stocks I'd say do stop losses but for options with low volume you can't bank on a limit stop and a market stop will fuck you just as hard.

I'm thinking about doing 50/50 ARKK/ARKG 2021 and just fucking off...am I a fool!?


The past couple weeks I wanted to break my portfolio from 100% CCL into some combo of ARKK/ARKG/PLTR/AAPL...tough decisions...
You asked this last night. Small tits compensate with juicy nipples.
Saddam was a horrible piece of shit... but he was the counter balance to Iran. We should have bombed the shit out of their industrial sites and that is it.
Join the club!
Wasn't keeping track. But was at 77/23 ratio stocks to bonds last year as well. When market went down, sold bonds and bought stocks. When market came back up did the reverse. Now at 82/18 ratio.
Rona and HIV combo pack, I say go for it
Man my neighbors just randomly lighting off fireworks. Some of us gotta work tomorrow ya hippie fucks!
Should've sold now at 23
50% either side that is... 😂
Same TSLA and AMZN spreads here. Hope it’ll work out
i think im just a degenerate sometimes :D

>Going to a bookstore has nothing to do with anything. Amazon is a thing.

Like I mentioned , those stats are from 2003. 

>Nor does the number of new books not read to completion, there are thousands of books out every year, 90% are probably not worth reading.

I think what it implies is people who buy new books dont finish reading thier books , they put them down and never pick them up again because they buy fantasy novels and manga maybe . Books that have skillsets and actually teach you everything the authors know on a subject is how you become an expert in the field of intrest .

Trying to execute my first covered call, but don’t know if I should purchase a 2022 contract for PLTR @27 or February 2021 @25
Some chick who did me dirty just slid back into my dms and ruined my vibe
Happy new year my beloved retards ❤️
You’re like that funny-drunk-gambler uncle that understands me.
It’s my birthday. Obviously Jan 15th is no joke.
I have about 22% of my total account invested between the two of them so I’m hoping they do ***something***
I was addicted to Percocet 30s. In the end I was doing upwards of 22 pills a day. 

Crazy when I started I could get 3 pills for $50. Eventually pill mills of Florida etc started to get cracked down on so prices pretty much became 30$ a pill (1$/mg). In the end though it was 35$ or 3 for 100$. 

Would take me like 6 30s at once to be functional as in not sick. 

My ultimate denial was that I wasn’t doing heroin so whatever it took to just not do that. My life was a complete and utter disaster.

Honestly this is dumb af and doesn’t belong here but shit, it makes me laugh every time I see it, so you can have my upvote
No PLTR, TSLA, or GME?

wut? The comment I replied to asked: "I wonder if there were as many naysayers early in tesla." There were undeniably naysayers in tesla 5-10 years ago ("early") and there were undeniably naysayers in tesla 6 months ago. Hence my reply. I don't know what you're possibly trying to argue here. 

Also anyone that jumped on the TSLA bandwagon 6 months ago and is still holding their shares right now is up 300% - in other words, they made one of the best share based plays of the year. What the fuck are you even talking about?
I swear I sit on the shitter to sell a put but by the time I flush I’m balls deep in FD calls smh

I work in tech myself just have an interest in global supply chains and logistics.  I have a few family members that work as buyers for lumber yards and steel service centers which is what turned me onto this market originally.
You mentioned Iraq was bad, how did things go in korea, fighting the Chinese?  If you're not a history aficionado, it went bad and it did nothing productive.

Iran, we have played that game before.  Went bad.

We've also toppled regimes in every South American country, and it has always gone poorly.

Every time somebody from WSB buys a call option (commission free at RH but with huge spread and worst price in market) a professional trader buys a put option at a real broker or he just shorts the stock. Then he waits for the WSB ponzi scheme to collapse, enjoys the ride down and waits quietly to redo.
Fuck. How are you feeling ? Any shortness of breath?
Edit: Thanks for the gold!!
Yeah... Why else are we here?
Agree that it’s not the cause, I just think we won’t reach the final floor until Feb when the shares are released and a new equilibrium is reached. After that I think the shares have nowhere to go but up.

If you have shares just ride out the turbulence, but I’d stay away from short term calls, maybe do leaps if you want to do options.
since when are we judging someone dreams ffs
it's an illness. its truly never enough. you just acclimate to bigger numbers and return to your baseline level of non-satisfaction.

Depends on your insti fund's mandate/parameters, tbh. Typically the junk status disqualifies the company's bonds or corporate papers from being bought. 

Have seen some instis dump automaker bonds ahead of expected cuts to junk status (for fund compliance) while averaging down their cost basis (ie buying more) on the same companies' shares for trading positions (although junk status tends to confer a stricter limit on the permitted equity exposure)

I’m at my usual hotel bar down the street from my condo and get to talking to this teacher that’s in town for some Education Conference. 

She’s from Savannah, Georgia? 

She has the accent. The hair. The height. 

She’s stunning. 

The more we talk, the more I’m realizing she’s analyzing me. I’ve studied psychology as a hobby and apparently she has a doctorate in it. 


I don’t like to talk. I’m usually the one asking questions. 
She starts getting into family life and all kinds of deep shit. 
I’m like *“How much is this conversation going to cost me? My therapist overcharges me. I’ll fire him via text right now.”*

She laughs and goes you’re a “Vulnerable Narcissist.” 

*I don’t know what that means. I study Human Factors.”*

“It means you’re a dick, but don’t mean to hurt anybody on purpose.”


*Well fuck me.* 

“Maybe I will.”

I work as a Data Scientist and you are absolutely correct. No other company out there right now is doing what Palantir does.

Building ML models around the data and coming up with effective strategies and solutions based on said data.

Data is the new oil of the 21st century. Companys all over the world want to leverage their existing data to guide them to make profitably decision. You think snowflake does that shit? HAHA Not even close.

You’re not wrong either sir.

This market is propped up in several different factors that I’ve been dipping toes in for research.

However—mixing money and morals together is not what this sub is about. A few years of destruction and death to retire, to make millionaires for those that survive. More than half this sub is all in. This the cheers when covid cases rise, with BECKY and Tech. 
This market is sick, and so are the people. Especially the younger crowd who have immensely hard chances to retire in the future. I don’t blame them for going all in—nothing to lose.

People have prices.
How does someone sell the OTM calls? Do you just click sell and offer to sell the stock you own in the future at an increased price? I have no idea how options work

Ahhhtism at its finest. GME is shit and have been closing like 70% of all their stores and firing all their staff. No future buisness model trying to bleed a dry turnip with their existing stores. Who is going to go out and buy games when you can download games at home without having to lose them or pay for gas and get pitched and pressured to buy used games and useless accessories and retarded subscriptions. GME is a dead buisness model and their will be no sqeeze because their is no future. Blockbuster 2.0

Hey gather around you fucking retards, let us not forget the many brave autists that yolo’d everything they had and are now destitute and knocking on poverties’ door. At least they fucking tried. Here is a toast to all our fallen comrades, may you all rest in tendie heaven one day 🥂
What the fuck did you just fucking say about me, you little penis? I’ll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy Penis, and I’ve been involved in numerous secret raids on Al-Quaeda, and I have over 300 confirmed penises. I am trained in penis warfare and I’m the top penis in the entire US penis forces. You are nothing to me but just another penis. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Penis, mark my fucking penis. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of penises across the USA and your penis is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little penis you call your penis. You’re fucking dead, penis. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare penis. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Penis Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable penis off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” penis was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn penis. I will shit penis all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, penis.

Dude CCP has huge support among the Chinese people. 60% of the Chinese people lived in extreme poverty just 3 decades ago, now they are like 15%. Legitimacy through financial empowerment is working, and until it doesn’t there is no CCP solution that wouldn’t result in 10 million casualties.

Doubt anyone is claiming losses on these stocks though. I’m debating jumping on the arkg bandwagon, but it seems like the valuations are insane. I’m just worried the sell off might be parted of a larger correction and shift away from these speculative stocks and back towards larger cap shit. Idk.

That's from 2003 and weve only gotten worse with those statistics in the last 10 years .

Also I never claimed I was so smart , I'm not some rainman , but I know these losses will offset the gains from cashapp probably enough  to just break even . I should have sold covered puts , but I guess my collateral is already spoken for .
Probably to discourage excessive amounts of shitposting. 🤷🏿‍♂️

Buy 1 share of GME on Monday for every upvote you get in this thread.
Seems like a lot of people have never worked retail.

Generally inventory is forecasted based on last year, typically though they expect an increase and send more units in hopes of selling them.

If they are sold out i would assume this means that they exceeded the sales they thought would occur.
Aka higher percentage of sales no fucking company in the world would send a crazy amount to a retail location because it wouldnt make sense  it isnt efficient, and can allow a waste of product or selling oppurtunity.

The fact they are sold out is a good thing.

I would also like to mention due to deals with gme  and other companies they get more consoles comapred to most retail locations.
Yeah its been a hard hard year for me. Really got trashed when i didnt qualify for uia because i hadn't worked at was in college, but one wrong argument with the parents and i was on the streets without a job or any way to pay the bills. Still am but im able to bum with a friend for now.

These are pretty radical propositions outside any propaganda campaign. That being said we have a giant ass military why aren’t we using it to protect US interests? You think China would be pussyfooting around if they were in our shoes?
Instead of scamming GME , you should be buying shares

My New Years resolution is to buy more GME
WELCOME TO 2020-PART II

YOUR PORTFOLIOS HAVE BEEN RESET
🎺 

There is your horn
Not talking about the market.
I hope you get to complete one on those 5 year old and up puzzles this year. Here’s hopin special fella
Honestly I was really exited to get on the hype and was ready to buy a handful of shares (maybe 10 I’m pretty broke) but robinhood doesn’t reach my country and I’m too retarded to find another way :(
good price to buy !! pt $40
GME, ARKK, PSTH
Its tomorrow afternoon in Sydney
Bought in my TFSA. Hoping for 500k tax free in 10 years. Wel see.
pick one of those. and tell me why.
Same 
$19.99
Happy new year's my fellow degenerates. 

Nothing better than a glass of fine bourbon and a cigarette to kick off the new year.
I do solemnly swear that my first trade of 2021 will be GME.
Life savings in $PLTR🚀
That would be awesome!
It ended ath. Wtf
4. Legalize heroine

Yeah, spend new years like a real man, crying in your car while stuffing your face with 41(they gave me one extra on accident) chicken mcnuggets while listening to quiet eurobeat.

Jim cramer blacked out off the pills and bourbon screaming at his family right now to take profits on QS

you know what i mean , and even those who ride that way no mean we never meant it in a menacing way.
What if you lost your job and had to use what little 401k money to survive. Am I still winning?
You still eat those Jared pedo whiches?
TR, is all I see
No one in their right mind that does that for a living would not use one. It’s like installing an aftermarket radio. Buy the appropriate harness and it’s plug and play. It’s almost impossible to install it without one unless you have the wiring schematics for the vehicle.
Go for the tuna 👌

Hopefully the USA grows a nutsack in 2021. Use that giant fucking military us taxpayers have been funding for decades. My wishlist:
1. Topple the CCP regime in China 
2. Knock out the Iranian ayatollah and their nuclear facilities
3. Invade Venezuela and establish new government
 i cant wish you a happy new year without being stupid rich, so i'm going to just wish you a New Year.

Happy New Year WSB

Pick 3 stocks for 2021.

Mine: SQ, NIO, and SE
That is what I figured it had to do with since you said..  
Nope I'm still in the worst year of my life.
Name checks out
NIO day already priced in and next week will be a small dip. NIO day will cause a short spike with artificial hype and NIO drops to around 40 the following week

nah dude it rad funny man
Porsche’s financial wizards realized there was an opportunity to control more than 100% of VW with their large number of shares already owned plus buying up options. They squeezed the duck out of some hedge funds who were obligated to close their positions at any price, Porsche essentially being the last people able to sell. Final price was more or less “give us everything you have.” Bankruptcies and lawsuits followed, but Porsche came out like champions.
Time to flip the calendar and clean the slate.  Your dad is proud of you.  Sorry for your loss.
Up 7,5% and a lot of life experience. Repeatedly getting fucked in the ass opens your mind. At least it's not a loss.
Shouldn’t we blame the left for censorship instead?

And ccp doesn’t own Reddit. A simple search should give you the answer.
Happy new year retards
So you want a girl that can’t fuck or suck for shit and bleeds and is in pain when you fuck her?

USA should be responsible for Spanish flu too? Pandemic happens all the time. MERS, H1N1..

Quick and short letter from a random degenerate redditor

I hope you all kick ass this 2021, I know it sounds cliche, but go out and do things you've always wanted to but you held yourself back, enjoy the simple things and most importantly cherish the moments with family and friends. 

This year I want to start taking flying classes, improve at skateboarding, learn web development, and most importantly - fitness. 2020 got too much focus on work and $$, but this year there shall be a balance. 

Happy new years.

Theta gang here, I hope a couple of the calls I sell bulls print for yall. You deserve it.

I hope every fucking put I sell expires worthless, fuck you bears
Ha, 2020 ending has me all soft and giving out advice. I buy on signs of upward momentum after coming off of a downswing, leaps don’t care about theta and if IV is lower due to recent retrace or whatever, You can benefit from Vega, you get a nice pop with minimal movement. A few percent upward movement equals a decent profit. Don’t hold until expiry, sell when you profit.

Happy new year boys. Wish you guys the mattes gains for 2021. Hope all of you will make money. If not double down

It was 850, but then I did a few refi’s on some rentals recently and it was above that. Which is weird AF as 850 was what I thought was peak.
I semi did that in grad school.  Graduated 4 years ago.  Just finishing up paying collections in 3 months.

Meh, $MP just about tripled
He's not wrong but about half of Americans don't have a 401k, for the ones that do, it is not contributed to enough to retire on. I think most Americans would rather a president focused on not having people's 401ks drained after accident or age related medical bills, than all time highs in a market where 90% of it is owned by the top 10%. But that's a discussion for another thread. The mass increase of retail traders is not a sign of increased disposable income, it's a sign of desperation.

Doesn't even need to be leaps, buy 3 months out. Plenty of 10 baggers there. Stop being a bitch and hold some shit.

You're not fucking smart enough to time shit. There's a chance you might be smart enough to recognize the general momentum of a stock. So pay the fucking premium and give your thesis a chance to move. Who gives a shit if you get a 5 bagger that could have been a 10 bagger if you bought weeklies instead? Fuck you monthlies are risky enough, I sell you those retarded weeklies that almost never print.

The congress allocates money, the Mango has no control over it. He actually proposed heavy cuts when he got in office, don't you remember the media attacked him for it? The way the ~~budget~~ continuation of spending process works is in order to get the things you want, you have to give them their money on their side. No way to cut spending. You can't even shut down the government cause they will give them the back pay + more afterwards.

Oh my god I would DIE that’d be amazing. Randy would be perfect for that.
Two questions:

1. Where am I able to see changes in volume? My Ally Invest option chain shows volume and OI, but you're specifically talking about institutions buying calls AND changes in the rate of call buying. I don't get to see those two things with my brokerage. Do I need a better brokerage for access to superior research?
2. What does "bag holding"
I bought 500 shares of this shitty company FCEL at $0.90 a share, back in July 2019. It was one of the first stocks I ever bought. A couple weeks later it was down 66% so I sold it thinking it was a dead end.

It’s currently trading at 12x what I bought it at, and 41x what I sold it at.

It would be manipulation if you created and manipulated that situation. This would be where people are playing with the cards that are dealt, not “fixing” the game and making people short it. It was their free choice to do so, so I wouldn’t consider that “manipulation”?
I'm responsible and generally theta gang, but fuck there's a damn rush I can't help but sink a couple grand into when it comes to buying options or trying to swing trade an obvious pump and dump.

Its been a while, but I don't think an actual casino is gonna do shit for me when I actually go back to one

Hedge funds aren't retarded. Stonks only go up. Your mom gay
Because what made the Porche deal special is most of the shares were owned by 2 institutions. not hard to get two people to be stubborn and see the potential. gamestop is a retail stock owned by lots of different kinds of people. The squeeze is there, but not the same epic proportions as there are people who will bail at 30, 45, 50, and so on. Taking the pressure off. The gamble is that they shorted it so bad that even those sell offs wont be enough to relieve the pressure and the stock still goes up anyway. I don't think they bought the stock for the squeeze, they bought for the board seat play.
So calls on $EAT?
Man I get emails from them every single dang day and the 20% coupons got me getting something every time

I’m bullish for GameStop... however I really think this tweet has nothing to do with his position in GME and much more to do with the pandemic.

 “an ounce of prevention”  is referring to the pandemic aka social distancing, masks etc, and “is worth a pound of cure” refers to the costs we’ve put ourselves through by not having the correct preventions in process.

But for confirmation bias’s sake it’s definitely nod towards the short squeeze.

HAPPY NEW YEARSZZ
Absolutely. Fucking tacky as hell.
I think that helps, but the truth is a lot of people fucked up to create this situation. They were and remain absolutely sure that game stop is about to go under. They got tunnel vision on the shorting, which is abnormal. Happy to take their money on the squeeze though.
I may drop the soap on purpose but im not a fucktard.

At a certain point, how do you even spend that much money?  Short of just straight gambling or blowing millions on a political campaign, how does somebody lose a billion dollars?  

A thousand million dollars is so much fucking money.  Even if you wanted to piss it away on frivolous things, all the cocaine and call-girls in the world wouldn't amount to a serious chunk of a B.  The only thing I can think of would be to buy a huge fleet of some rapidly depreciating vehicle like cars or yachts.

AAPL is entering the correction wave 2 , about to retrace 60% of the past run up 115 to 138 . Will be around 128 . Then it will enter the 3rd wave and shoot way up for the earnings run up and blast off after earnings to around 175-185 before entering corrective wave 4 then retracing a bit then blasting to 200 or beyond it

Not sure the exact numbers about the top wave but  I’m almost positive about the first 1-3 waves

Bought $700calls expiring today. Rode them up and then bought more. Sold for profit.
PLTR spent a month consolidating. The pennant looked fucking beautiful. I didn't want to fucks with a meme stock but PLTR is legit. Maybe its valuation had risen to fast but I just saw the pattern. I fucking saw it. A bulge formed in my Netherland and I knew what to do. All of my money was in PLTR. All of it. My purchased wife was so angry. She can't leave but her boyfriend was extra vicious in our communal love sessions. I had to prove it to them so I doubled down.

Then PLTR rose 10% in a day. I saw it. I fucking felt the belt buckle of my pants break as my account soared. My wife loved me again and even was willing to shed her boyfriend. 

Then it happend. PLTR reached the peak of its consolidation. A monster green cock pounding at the biggest MM sell wall the market has ever seen. I could taste the sweet tendie nectar rolling down from that resistance. The market opened and PLTR clapped $29's cheeks. I gushed in ecstasy. 

Then the deathly march began. Day after day PLTR pounded my ass into oblivion. Each day I told myself "Its going to recover. Its the tax man. We will be alright!"

Then New Years Eve happened. The IV finally crushed my spirits. -17% and -99% later I was left with nothing. Nothing but you beautiful mentally challenged monkeys and my tarnished pride.

But atleast.. atleast my QS calls would print.
Right now the steel/iron trade is like being a toilet paper maker at the beginning of Covid, and buyers are scrambling to secure toilet paper in any form.  This is causing a bubble where buyers are a either paying these elevated costs, delaying their order hoping prices flatten, which if they don't is the 🚀 everyone is looking for (the allocation problem); or are pre-purchasing well in advance of normal order windows.  Work orders are 20+ weeks out, and shipping times have turned into a best guess.  There does not look to be any short term solve for this problem and so far the adjustments they have made have only been touching on prices for a day before the increase hits another product.  There will be some major winners in this market, $MT has a good chance at being one of them, but so do any vertically integrated producers that arn't bound by previous contracts.

Or you take some percent profit.  Make it 50?  Take 20% out and play with the rest.  Make it to 100?  Take another 20% out and play with the rest.  How much you take out is based on how degenerate you are, but the key factor is take profits.  OP could've easily walked away with 50k here and still made roughly the same plays.

As I understand it, it is not interest free.  The interest accrues, it's just added as future payments (plus the principal you eventually have to make up.)

Also, if you plan on buying another house or refinancing the one you're in, you usually have to show 12 months on time payment history.  There was some question on this the last time I asked about it (and others in the comments say you just have to be caught up).  Get the answer to this before you decide this is what you believe to be prudent.

Hey guys what is going on, welcome to my YouTube channel haha, do you know if there is some school of thought, philosophy, or religion that advocates that a good chunk of our existence is essentially an artificial construct that we've draped over reality, like a semi-sheer wedding veil, and that any attempts to establish our own undeniable truths such as "We all deserve to have a good life" or "Happiness is important" are utterly futile, because the only real truths that exist are just the observable facts of the universe, like "water boils at 100" or "TSLA 2/19 800c"

QQQ is not an index that safe index fund investors would choose. The S&P 500 and NASDAQ had \~17%, with the Dow Jones significantly below that.

Bye brother
I don’t see today as a big sell off.  I see the price moving down by the algos on very low volume; options being cleared out. The institutions want the shares at a lower price.  Weak hands will be shaken loose off of their shares.  Once they load up the buy recommendations will begin, the SP will take off.

Happy New Year boys 🎉
No, the gut puncher was you not taking profits.

The fact you think the gut puncher wasn't going in on TSLA shows you havent learned your lesson and you are actually retarded.

You were lucky enough to get to 230, but dumb enough not to take any profit.  You are lucky enough to lose this all on the 31st, because if you had waited until 2021, the taxes you would've owed wouldve ruined the rest of your life.  You've gotten lucky twice.  If you can manage to get lucky a 3rd time, look back to these moments.
Are you just following trends with short DTE’s?
## YESS YESS YESSS
Happy New Years my fellow Autists. May the Tendies reign down in 2021.
Happy new year retards. Its good to have yall on my phone when i need reassurance that my positions dont suck dick.  Cheers to all the tendies that you made and cheers to all the tendies that you didnt make.   🥊🥊
How did you make 9k trading TSLA today?
New year. Vaxx rollout is sucking on a macro level. The idiot winds are rustling and people are gonna start the year with a flight to safety because we can’t fucking fly anywhere else

When you can't even afford tendies, I suppose you've got nothing else to do except focus on creating top-notch memes.

This is how you know people that post their insane gains are just very lucky retards. His thought process was “damn I’m good at this stock market thing I bet I can go from +1000% to +10000%”
The short answer is a hedgefund has to be responsible, for every play they make, they have to have a cover. this limits risk but also limits reward.  

There's nothing stopping you as an individual from blowing your entire salary on lottery tickets. That's the difference.  This play is risky, uncharted waters. That's not what they do.
Make sure you're up at 6am for the pre-market.
What do you do
Thiccccc
Isn’t the market closed tomorrow? STOP TRICKING ME.

Not an expert, but essentially investors who owned shares since before the IPO are now allowed to sell their shares. Sometimes that means there is a drop in price due to an increase of supply of shares.

Thats the difference between a trader and an investor, I think, especially for one who is probably eyeing a leadership role within the company. A high short percentage of float and distressed valuation of the company severely limits their options for raising capital, and increases the dilution of existing shares resulting from any new share issuance. 

He probably wants to increase his position, kick shorts out, and have the price skyrocket, possibly at the same time. It buys goodwill from existing investors in the event of a leadership struggle.

Yikes
I think I’m going to invest in Blockbuster stock and RadioShack stock for the short squeeze
There is some truth to this.

The billionaire *does not* want the stock rise whole they are assuming a long position.  They want it cheap.  Cheap as possible.  Insitutional (or billionare) market is not based on driving the price up, *unless they already own the stock percentage they want*.  This one is important for the people in the back:

*IF THEY ARE DRIVING THE PRICE UP THROUGH THEIR WORDS IT IS BECAUSE THEY INTEND ON SELLING IT OUT*.

When options expiration date comes around, all of the calls and options that are in the money are executed, generally after hours is when they reconcile. Each options contract represents 100 shares. So for every 10,000 options contracts, that’s 1,000,000 shares that are transferred from one party to another. These transfers are represented by the volume but since they’re based on pre-set price points they won’t affect the price of the stock.

New Years is an imaginary date that we’ve all mutually agreed on. Nothing has changed. We’ve been programmed to convince ourselves to start new habits. Meanwhile Uncle Sam is soundly asleep waiting to count the money you’ve depleted on food, friends, and fireworks in the middle of winter for a false sense of hope. The only way to break the cycle is stay home and shitpost on WSB at midnight using free McDonald’s WiFi.

Yes, but soon this will be considered privilege. They will be a group where success is seen as privilege, not hard work. In the present and future asians are going to face both racism, unfair treatment, and, to top it all off, they will be seen as oppressors. It's not going to get better for them

First of all what dip. Second the position was trimmed so he’s not fully exposed if it goes sideways by Jan. Yes there’s still the likelihood of the price reaching new 52w highs leading up to ICR. The difference is you’d be buying contracts at a way richer premium, the situations aren’t comparable.
Holy shit. Calm down Chad Dickens.

**long story**

When 2020 began, I had 1k in my Robinhood. Then I hit an AMZN earning lotto for 10k, which prepared me for the pandemic. When corona began, my political cynicism was finally monetized. I hit 100k in Feb. I started telling my family. They started giving me some money to manage.

Then Powell pummeled me back down to 40k. In hindsight I have no idea why I kept shorting. Some businesses were thriving in the new environment. The Federal Reserve pledged unlimited support and buying returned. Sure, the news flow was terrible, but they always are.

I managed to turn my dumbass around and rode FANG / Tesla calls to ATH of 140k in September. 

Then I don't know what happened. Lots of chasing and paperhands. The most devastating one was selling my zoom calls the day before it went 70%. That was like 40k by itself...

I also pussied out and sold everything on election night at bottom after eating 2 months of decline..... then my dumb liberal brain couldn't long anything for a hilariously long time. The part of me that made me in Feb made me lose out on one of the greatest rallies in history.

There was a final hail mary with TSLA S&P inclusion, but I bought too many otm calls and didn't take it when I was up 20k. Ended up making 0 from that TSLA run as my option losses canceled out my shares.

Long story short, I'm finishing the year with a lame balance of 110k. I know it's still way more than I had, but given the amount of capital I had on hand and amount of things that ran.... shoulda just bought SPY on election night....

Also grabbed 20k in student and auto loans along the way. I should probably get a job.

[My top 10 wins and losses](https://imgur.com/a/UQMW1jh)

You can see I didn't do anything worthwhile since September lol.

All of my family accounts made more than the index this year, so that's nice...? I was not able to recreate the February fire for most. Only one account made it to 80% on the year, but that was because he gave me money before Feb lol. 

I also found that it's generally impossible to trade with family money. I get even more paper handsy.

If I learned anything this year, it's that you HAVE to embrace FUD. It's always there. In hindsight millionaire makers are conviction leaps. I looked at TSLA $1000 leaps so many times from Jan to May. Just one woulda been 250k in gains...

Anyway, that's my story. Thanks for reading

Good luck next year everybody. Happy new year!

I am trained in penis warfare and I’m the top penis in the entire US penis forces. You are nothing to me but just another penis. I will wipe you the fuck out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on this Penis, mark my fucking penis. You think you can get away with saying that shit to me over the Internet? Think again, fucker. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of penises across the USA and your penis is being traced right now so you better prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic little penis you call your penis. You’re fucking dead, penis. I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare penis. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Penis Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable penis off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” penis was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn penis. I will shit penis all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, penis.

I just think it's a dumb notion that nobody wears a mask when working with asbestos or lead when they're young, smokes 2 packs a day, drinks like a fish, doesn't think about the long term, then they have a shitty old life with a broken body. Then they cut everything out and try to live 5 years healthy after they retire.. after all the damage has already been done. I think it' better to live healthy when you're young and save all the bad shit for when you're old and it doesn't really matter how much longer you'll live. It's like a low mileage car vs a high mileage car. Which one are you going to treat like shit? The high mileage beater.. not the brand new one. You're going to full throttle it, brake stands, turbo, NOS, everything. Same goes for humans..

I think you meant to link something at the end but it's not there. So what took place? You seem to have a much better understanding of this steel trade. Is this steel trade looking rosy or like a flaming turd?

I clearly don't understand how reddit works...can he cash those in on GME options or nah?
Why the fuck would someone who’s trying to build up a long position want the price to rise? You retards think Cohen wants the price to go UP? FFS this sub is next level retarded sometimes.
Happy New Year retards!
Looking forward to another year of TSLA quadrupling in value.

Everyone hate 2020 except rich people. Let's hope this retarded bull run continues.

Happy new year !!! 🥂🍾🥂

Here’s to claiming those capital losses 🥂

Bro I haven't masturbated since LAST YEAR
break the bonds that chain you only to create new bonds that chain you LOL
Why, you think no chance the options get executed and you have to sell your shares?
Balance sheet fuckn rekt after these promos yo
My eyes.
Relatively same thing happened to me, peaked around 30 and lost most of it towards the end of the year. Thankful to have parked some in b!tco1n and other shitcoins to still be holding some profits. Hell, that 1k still has a chance. It’s a new year. Learn from your mistakes, change your philosophy, and definitely don’t chase losses. Godspeed brotha.
Can you explain PLTR lockup for a fellow retard?
Happy new year
