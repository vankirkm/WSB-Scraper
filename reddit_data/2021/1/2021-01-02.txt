I think this website states that its charged daily but only applied to your account once a month. The stock price will determine the nominal value that interest is charged on. It has nothing to do with borrowing rate though. Borrow rates can change daily.
That's active management for you

US needs to put a green curtain over China
If they want to stay in the United States market they must follow the same law of rule as other companies from US like financial audits. China always want preferential treatment. They are biggest scum bags in the world while being the first to excuse other people being unfair to them.

well Hyundai just recalled 77,000 kona EV's over 14 spontaneous battery fires in the last 2 years, GM also had a recalled around 70,000 EV's over battery fire risk when in a high state of charge. Tesla has well over 1 million cars on the road and they have never had battery issues ore fire rates this bad and its because they actually do care about quality when peoples lives on the line but do neglect the cosmetic stuff.

Yes, it isn't 100% because there's a 0.000001% chance the Stripe CEO dies before Ackman's January announcement and his successor takes it public via PSTH. Such wiggle room.

I don't have the personal experience to offer that GP does, but I can tell you this - don't try & deal with this alone, or in silence. Trauma (in any form - physical, mental, emotional) is a real MF'er and it will fuck you up in all sorts of unexpected ways that don't even seem related, until you can get the resolution or healing that you need.  

Which probably won't be easy - but if you don't deal with it at all it'll tear you up from the inside. Seek help - a counselor, a therapist, psychiatrist, spirituality, religion - there's lot of avenues, and it may take you a while to find the one / couple that work(s) for you, but don't give up. Keep trying, just one day at a time.  

And drugs & drink aren't effective for this - don't start down that road, or turn back if you have. They may dull you for a while, but they ain't no cure, and in fact they will just make it harder to get whatever you need that will actually help you.

Good luck & Godspeed!

This makes no sense. In order to play games on my Xbox live I need to have an account anyway. Buying from gamestop doesn't save me from having a microsoft account.

The wiggle room here, as in any business, is that money talks. Always. Or it’s not a business. If the right deal comes along, you take it, even if you weren’t planning on it.

If they specifically and categorically rule out a deal with PSTH, that’ll be 100%. General statements that they don’t think they’re ready are not the same thing and are not 100%.

Yeah but I think pltr call to fame is their social media analysis. I'm not sure ibm or Google have the same scale. But I think with the right attitude they could get into the game. Of course both are mega caps and there's the stigma for helping the government spy on people which could help pltr stay in the conversation. Either way pltr seems like a day or swing trade stock right now, or leaps I guess.

> “Using digital numbers that come from nowhere to buy assets from banks is not printing money because my definition of money is that dollars are only created when banks lend” lol this is such a ridiculous pedantic argument over semantics.

That is absolutely not semantics.  You have a fundamental misunderstanding of what money is, and what QE actually does.  When the Fed buys treasuries from primary dealer banks, they receive bank reserves in return - NOT currency. It's an asset swap.  The Fed cannot create money. Period.  It is literally against the Federal Reserve Act.  

We all know money printing would cause inflation.  So if QE is money printing, why isn't there inflation?  Because QE is NOT money printing.

I don't know why you don't get *"no means no"*, it's a pretty simple concept. 100 target pool companies, 50 candidates that match Ackman's criteria, and somehow the handful that have openly rejected it and people are like *"yup that must mean they're just saying no to negotiate a better deal!"*

Skip your OTM FD's next week and go get yourself a WaterPik - makes a HUGE difference. It's noisy AF, but I \*hated\* flossing with regular floss, or even those little dental stick things - but with my WaterPik - I do it almost every night now.  Do it consistently and in a couple of weeks your gums will start to heal and should stop bleeding, since you are literally blasting the infected shit out of them.

they lie. We make decisions based on information here, and those can be good or bad decisions, you can win or lose.

  
But the spectre that hangs over everything we do is fraud. They hire people to pump bullshit stock to trick us into buying it, and if you fall for one of those its a guaranteed loss

DWD is a douche. Mods ban anyone who mentions him.
This [site](https://www.tradingdirect.com/pricing/Interest-Rates) makes it sound like it’s a fixed % that’s calculated at the end of each month based on the current stock price.  Does anyone have the short interest #s going back a few years? I’ve got the iBorrowDesk data from the past 5 years but it’s just shares available which is sort of meaningless since so many gme shares on margin get recycled to be sold short again.

You never told me what rule you're referencing is or where to find it. A citation would be saying "rule 341 of such and such organization states that..." thats what I want from you, so I can verify the information easily and have this discussion. Thats what's required for good faith argument.

Also I'm a graduate student and adjunct professor. I have an international teaching licenses as well and lived in China last year. I continue to work for a university up there as an online teacher.

Absolutely in this case. All the old school car companies thought they knew everything. They "knew" that tesla and it's EVs would never succeed, that they would sell a few cars to some of the hippy environmentalist crowds and then soon go bankrupt and fold and everything would return back to normal.

Well, looky, looky now. Countries around the world are starting to make commitments to ban the future sales of ICE vehicles and they're all playing catch up to tesla.  They all arrogantly stopped trying to innovate and accept change like blackberry did when they were on a roll. Well, look at blackberry today  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

With usa delisting those Chinese stocks this week the ccp said they will retaliate. If they want to flex a bit they can just shut down a few American factories in China on some flimsy pretext, just to show what they can do. Tesla is pinning a lot of hopes for their capacity on the Chinese factory, and in consequence must appease the government. I don't know, but there are a lot of risks there when usa/China are stepping up their posturing moves.

If you love her, do it. If you want to get wasted and fuck random gutter trash, don't do it.
Jan 27th - Feb 1st.No firm date yet. Guidance will be 1M vehicles delivered in 2021, so 100% auto growth. Which would give TSLA an average PE of 513 for 2021 if they deliver all 1M vehicles, and we assume all other revenue streams increase proportionally to auto as well.
Do you the significance of running your credit? It appears you don’t. Therefore, you aren’t smart enough to trade.

>we're still quite early in Stripe’s journey. And when I say that, you might roll your eyes, given that we've been at this for 10 years. But we’re still growing at quite a fast rate and still investing very heavily in future growth...In many regards we’re still growing at startup-like rates and investing at startup-like rates... We're more in the helter skelter expansion phase and will be, I think, continuing to operate in that mode for a few years.

Which jives exactly with what Ackman said at the start of PSTH about Stripe not being "mature enough" once he had talked to them. 

Clearly that came directly from their CEO, and Ackman/Stripe behaved politely unlike the jackasses at AirBnB that publicly crowed about how they were asked and turned it down to make themselves seem more important, as if Ackman hadn't asked 100 different companies.

***Homes of Pelosi, McConnell are vandalized after Senate fails to pass $2,000 stimulus checks***

Graffitti such as "Weres my money?" was seen on McConnell's main entrance door, where as and "We want everything" along with "Cancel Rent" was sprayed on Pelosi's garage.

Pig's head and fake blood was also left by Pelosi's garage door.🐷🩸

Lot of work for a scamming method, when love scams with old people works a lot better. Ask me how I know (and how my grandma remortgaged her home)
Wtf is DWD? This weekend thread is weird each week.
Uh... positions?
Well that got deleted quickly
Fuck you
There are no bid gov contracts all the time.
So I don't normally do meme stocks here, though I read and participated amply. But I decided to recently, like last week, to engage PLTR to the tune of 10K, not a lot comparing to the residential PLTR bets, and sure enough, I am losing 20% and counting.

And the spider-sense that helped me gained in the last couple of years is telling me that PLTR is penetrating lower. The easy money has been made. The players are leaving the room.

FML.

Still can't get a good job like myself. Blowin cock behind Wendy's atm but hoping to move into the fry cook position opening next month.
I mean... By this point, it’s probably cheaper for him to pay whatever interest forever than buying all the shorted stocks back.
??? Is it low or high?

Why?
You’re the Wall Street Bets Siddhartha. 

“Siddhartha has one single goal-to become empty, to become empty of thirst, desire, dreams, pleasure and sorrow-to let the Self die. No longer to be Self, to experience the peace of an emptied heart, to experience pure thought-that was his goal.”
It’s a clean energy play. Probably has some volatility for day traders and some growth long term. The big/fast play is over
Yep
Who the fuck are you?
I call it truffle butter.
How
It means you 69 your wife’s boyfriend 5 times a week
I thought this is WSB and we are supposed to inverse everything???
As if institutions can tell the future 🙄
Good enough for me 🚀🚀🚀🚀
90% of what I do is BnH so this is pretty accurate for me. I buy whatever is crashing down.

Managed to buy my wife a new plastic bracelet for her to wear when dating her boyfriend with my 5% annual gains. Maybe in 10 years I can pay off the debt
Lmfao the disrespect and retardation
Calls on PLTR, we got to get some stats on this mysterious object to counter it.
Why? What does it say?

Tesla was a pos until last year. Past performance isn’t indicative of future.

Lots of reasons but buyout is #1. See my comment/post history.

Nothing you said made any sense. You're just using racist mad libs. Like you're actually retarded.
I appreciate this comment. It was well written and provides a solid insight into why Amazon’s multiples are so high yet the share price remains stable. I don’t doubt that Amazon will continue to grow and I’m certainly not suggesting that Amazon is necessarily overvalued but I definitely still believe that when looking at Alibaba’s financials the market has discounted it far too much and that’s mainly due to “China Risk” in my opinion.

bruh it's just a matter of colors. if it was pink and rainbow, you'd feel safe af

Sometimes, you gotta just let someone know you fucked up and you’re lucky you got friends and if you do it again you’re getting a real dicking.

They're definitely going places and have an absolutely vast and diverse range in which to continue growing in the long term 👍

Is that like the begging of a Hallmark movie? OK, I’ll bite. 

Your girlfriend works in the big city in a soulless job. You are rich, but she feels something is missing. On day, she bumps into some dude in flannel shirt who looks like Mathew McConaughey. He tells her he’s from bumfuck nowhereville. She falls for him. He convinces her to move down there. The townsfolk are dirt  poor, but don’t make meth as you might suspect. No, they make Christmas stocking caps all year long. They make $12/ year. Shit money, but they’re happy. They have a wedding day...you show up to the chapel make, beg for her to come back, tendies, etc. she turns you down cuz she’s happier living in shit. 
The end.

"Have no inclination to preserve what they inherited" 

Someone has drunk the American first, pseudo-white nationalist coolaid.

You're ideas about this are just wrong and I'm not really feeling typing up anything else. So just go read some left philisophy like "the conquest of bread" or "what is property?" And that's basically my position too. 

Listen I can do a google search, but this is an argument. When someone postulates something in an argument the burden of proof is on them to prove it. You do that with a citation. A citation is, for example, naming the specific rule you're talking about. Or linking to the specific page with the rule highlighted, or linking to a news article talking about said rule. 

Since you won't do that I'm going to assume you're full of shit. Or ignorant, since I explained it to you that second one is not really applicable anymore. So unless you're next comment includes a citation, you're full of shit.

I do enough of my own research for classes I'm not about to spend my winter break doing it for you too. Unless you pay me lol.

Stripe literally said they aren't doing anything for several years because they have a ton of growth left before they go public. In other words the founders aren't morons that are going to leave billions in cash on the table for useless investors to vacuum up.

Bloomberg literally denied the rumor ***in*** the article that leaked the rumor, when they were asked for comment, but the moron author published anyway. Then they denied it again on twitter minutes after the article went live.

Not my hopes and dreams; I think it’s probably neither. And the statements you refer to are negative indicators. But that’s not the same thing as “100% ruled out.”

Maybe 98% ruled out in Bloomberg’s case. Stripe is probably more like 60%.

Stripe, especially, has said nothing approaching your “we’re not interested” characterization.

Honestly I’m getting more scared of COVID then I was last year. Not sure if I’ve had it yet or not but have read some real scary stuff.
My stocks haven't been trading sideway last week :(
Your going to have an intervention?
Are you offended. Breaking Bad is about a teacher that cooks meth. Does that offend you
Thanks brother. Yeah I’m definitely autistic but not that fucking autistic. If PLTR does not fucking moon on Monday then we are all giga fucked. People are going to be eager AF to buy the dip on PLTR and I think next week the market will be overall bullish in general because of the New Year FOMO. Honestly, it can go either way as far as PLTR’s short term price is concerned so that is why I was super on the defensive with my position on Thursday.
DWD literally thinks everyone that died of Covid would have been saved under different government leadership.  Dude is very literally delusional.  Idk why people care so much.
That’s fine too. I’ll roll the spreads to a lower strike price. I think I would only make more with puts if it drops like more than 8% on Monday, which almost certainly won’t happen.

Wrong, both have publicly said they are not interested in a merger with PSTH. 

In the case of Stripe it's been said ***repeatedly***, starting with Ackman right after PSTH launched and ending with the CEO a month, but you idiots keep asking for further proof as if a blatant "no" isn't good enough to compete with your personal hopes and dreams.

I think it’s important to have other reasons to hold, other than the possible MOASS. Cohen being onboard and then increasing his stake are big plusses. I haven’t done the math, but it seems to me the 3% he purchased last month cost nearly as much as his original 9.8%. This was another step in a calculated series of planned steps, all part of a Cohen master plan. I’m a big believer in Cohen and am along for the ride chiefly due to his commitment. The fact he doesn’t need me, my paltry investment, or my share votes makes me trust him more. 

I certainly would rather be allied with Cohen than bet against him.

Also wild rumors.

I hear RC drinks the blood of Virgin short sellers.
If he offers an institution 10% above market to buy their block of shares that would be hard for most institutions to turn down.  
The cfo said on last results call he’d prerelease q4 revenue number in early January.  If this number is huge things will get interesting.

> And what is everybody saying about PLTR? No, the stock is extremely overvalued, shorted by citron and bla bla bla. You wanna know why the first two are not being shorted? Their price targets not lowered? Yeah, because they were launched as IPO by the big banks. Almost nobody is saying shit about SNOW, even though the company is astronomically overvalued. That stock is covered in ointment made from JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs, and every other major bank. Because well, they don't like getting a cold shoulder and have it IN for PLTR.

Guys, so from reading the threads, it seems like many Tesla bears have also infiltrated the sub!

The sentiment on TSLA is getting a bit more bearish than I thought, this might cause a short term stagnation for TSLA as more bears come out and pull out another "overvalued" thesis out, but will then send the stock to the moon again. Those same idiots will FOMO hard imo.

Remember, forward PE is 185...
I don’t have a horse in the race but my guess is that he’s going to pivot the physical locations into competitive gaming spaces. Not sure about the other prospects for the company but competitive gaming is a decent green field for a company with their name recognition.

Only thing worse than that is when somebody finally does say The Sopranos is the best and people try to argue with them and say it's actually not even good
I have to say that. PLTR is going to fuck up a gain 🙏
Idk tho - Notre Dame beat UNC 31-17, and A&m got smoked when they planned Bama. Someone in r/cfb said any team would have gotten smoked against bama which I kinda agree with
Still better than renting all the time
What’s interesting is that almost all of that revenue growth is from existing customers (dated to the end of 2019) rather than new customers in 2020 (despite all that S&M spending). On the government side, $102 million of the $112 million revenue increase (91%) came from existing clients, while $43 million of the $47 million of growth in commercial revenues (91% as well) came from existing customers.

In other words, Palantir remains heavily reliant on its existing customer base — and particularly its government clients — for new growth.
Why didn't you just put it in qqq and forget about it?
Let's all jump into a stock that already ran nearly 500% in 6 trading days.  Over 10x in less than 2 weeks is totally normal.

From $4100 to $7900 in my RH gambling account. At one point I was down to $3300 and at another point I was up to $11000. It was a wild ride and I'm happy to end up 31% YTD.

My tax advantaged accounts are not as exciting, but they recovered nicely after I made some lump contributions near previous ATH in Feb. HSA account: Up 16%, Trad IRA: Up 22%,  ROTH IRA: Up 31%

stonks always go up
Oh snap. What did you do? That seems excessive.

GME is/was a fucking WSB pump and dump bro. Why the fuck would you be investing in a store that sells video games in 2021. Buy fucking anything else. Amazon, Google, Facebook all good options for what you havent already lost. Forget about it for a few years and you'll be up 50% pretty much guaranteed. Then maybe your dad won't be dissapointed in how fast his son can burn his money on garbage meme stocks.
Ok, what’s the move for this upcoming Monday? Should i add more position? Or sell?
Have you seen incite’s domain? [They on that good shit.](https://inciteinc.com/)

Sorry, I'm not skeptical of the bullish thesis but I do doubt a price pump of a few dollars would trigger a  MOASS. The fact that we've had huge short interest over such a long period of time makes me wonder how much powder the shorts have at their disposable to keep this thing down, I just think they got more tricks up their sleeves to suppress the price for now
[removed]
U DISRESPECT DWD! LITERALLY THE NICEST PERSON ON THIS SUB 😡😤
Yeah but she's still alive so when the producers run out of content in five years they can bring her back
How confident are we nio goes up?
Even better is it ties up a minimum of 125% of that in margin/equity so they effectively feel an amplification on the price. Also we have to remember until the moment they change their thesis and start to unwind that this just makes it easier to justify more aggressively trying to short sell the stock.
Wait dwd banned?!?
Want to delete all social media, Reddit and dating apps from my phone so bad. I’m such a pussy I can’t.
so from reading the comments, seems like Tesla Bears have also infiltrated the WSB section. I think tesla will drop through the next month or maybe a bit longer or at lesat stay stagnant. Then it will rocket up again. The fomo will be hard be prepared!

No matter how much money I have I’ll still be upset about spending over $300 on bindings.
You got stuck with the law of sums instead and now have two shitboxes instead of just 1 😛 on a more serious note, I hope it’s not a serious issue in your cars and if there is, tesla isn’t being a bitch about fixing it, like they are often with customers. I personally wanted to long tesla stock as well as buy one in 2018-19 but after researching around, was and am still convinced it’s shit tier.

Everyone thinks 2021 is more bullish than last year...so everyone is just full send without second thought because now even the shoe shine boy is all in. No one will be worried about buying the top. This will create a feedback loop which keeps taking us to almost unbelievable heights. Make your money this year because 2022 will be messy.

Honestly I think all cars are hit or miss.. if you get a good one you love it and if you get a bad one you’ll hate it and all brands are this way.  The only issue with my Audi was that fucker guzzled oil like crazy, I had to keep a few quarts on hand to top it off. It wouldn’t leak oil it just burned it fast. I also have a Volvo SUV and some people hate the brand and say it’s unreliable but mine has been a tank and had never had an issue.

GME is going to be bought out by Microsoft and turned into Apple stores but for Xbox and game pass, they will be used as retail locations to absorb people into the game pass/Xbox ecosystem. Half Arcade / Half Xbox store

That will be one of their answers to Sony this generation as Sony isn’t a trillion dollar company and can’t afford to just completely purchase a retailer out.

Put 40% into VOO, 40% into QQQ, 20% into more speculative plays or companies you like. It's not sexy but it's safe. Or if you believe in Cathie Wood like I do then I'd do 40% VOO, 20% QQQ, 20% ARKK/ARKG/ARKF depending on which one you like or split amongst the three, then 20% into speculative plays. If you're under 30 you also can't go wrong going in on some good dividend stocks(dividend reinvestment is really strong despite this subs dislike for dividend stocks). I'd recommend Verizon, Coke, and Altria. If you want some good singular stocks I'm a big fan of JD, TSM, and PSTH (this one is a SPAC though).

RKT is a good business however their success does depend on a couple of external factors which are out of their control. 
1. Interest Rates 
2. Ability for Fannie Mae & Freddie Mac to hold those mortgages in their books. (RKT’s mortgage volume is quite large and would never be able to keep them in their books hence they need to sell them to federal entities)

There really is a limit to the stock valuation.

The most bans I’ve seen so far were 4. I don’t know if 4 is the limit, but that’s the most I’ve seen.
That’s what I was thinking, but shes a bit crazy. Is it worth it? Maybe for her father

I want to have sex. I want men to find me sexy. It sucks being poor. I want drive a Lamborghini and get my nails done. I want a boyfriend to give endless blowjobs to. I'm almost 21 with a tight pussy and have never been to a club or bar. I'm even trying to get rich on a male dominated sub. Help me.
If you’re looking for long term, I would look to some 2/15/21 GME calls. You’re looking at some substantial stability in a very well structured and undervalued company. Over the long term until 2/15, you should see some very reasonable returns.

yea but if he does that during/after it starts squeezing - they will pull in more than 100m. The 100m was based on what the stock was trading at when the decision was made to introduce it.  


IF we squeeze to 50-60 range, and then he pulls the trigger - they spent 100m to buy share holder loyalty and pump up excitement in the stock, and he also would make 200m.... that would be some genius level shit right there.

I don’t see that being relevant to a ban at all. But I don’t even know who we are talking about. Hopefully they’re back soon, sounds like a chill ass dude.

That's the (loose) rumor. RC's latest tweet goes against that rumor. They won't be getting a good price regardless and how high will the price go if we no longer have 70m short + 140m long positions?
If you're financially stable and it makes you happy and won't affects your kids/wife's future (if you have them, obviously consult the wife first) then I'd say go for it. It will definitely be something you remember for the rest of your life fondly. If you're single then definitely do it. I realized this year that money isn't really worth it if you don't enjoy it every once in a while. I'm pretty frugal despite my income level but I've splurged on a nicer TV and a new mattress and new kitchen stuff and it's all been worth it. If you do get it post some pics :)

You are right. I just hope the market shares your optimism because I do prefer the perpetual run up over 3m up 3 m down 3m up then 3m of tanking
Algos dude. No people.
This news is small peanuts. The new strain of covid is putting kids in the icu in England. 6th grade to 29 seem to be more susceptible to it. What do you think the us is gonna do once a bunch of kids start getting hospitalized across the country? “But patho the us government didn’t give a shit about the elderly.” Duhh. But kids and young adults? That shit hits different. It’s here. We spent all this time in the last year developing this vaccine but failed to test it out in this patient population. 
What’s theys gonna do if kids start dying? Keep the US open? Nahh we getting locked back up. March 20 came early. Buy puts. Or don’t and get fucked. 
This kid news will be the news this week. It’ll over shadow most of the other stuff. Cause not only does it disproportionately affect kids, it spreads quicker too. This year is lookin more 🌈🌈🌈🌈 every day

Key word is worked.  When people bought physical copies they could come browse and sell their old copies.  That model is just about dead now.  I can also go to bestbuy and due to the higher ceilings, has less of that desperation and nerd sweat smell.  Just saying.

UBI isn’t socialism. It’s also not what these stimulus checks are.

The PPP is vastly worse for capitalism since its propping up companies that otherwise would have failed anyway.

When you have such a massive spike in unemployment due to events that are reshaping the world you need to act quickly. No decision is worse than the wrong decision. You can’t let laborers starve to death until we find the “ideal solution”.

Once unemployment is under control obviously these checks should stop. This is a tremendous opportunity to start moving money around to benefit labor and have that trickle up to the best corporations that deserve the capital injection instead of the insane idea that trickle down economics works.

It’s a fascinating problem because there isn’t a right answer. It’s just experiments to discover which is the least incorrect. Running from the experiments is childish and dangerous.

I've pretty much made an ass of myself for the last month and pissed away a lot of my gains on literally nothing. No excuses, I have to be better than this.

If Tesla chooses to sell directly to customers then they also choose to have their sales numbers represent actual sales to actual customers. It's their free choice, so they get to live with all of its implications, both beneficial and problematic. The legacies don't have to take back cars that their dealerships don't sell. Once it's sold to the dealership, that's the end of the story as far as the auto maker's finances are concerned.

Counting cars produced is pointless because you could always end up with a glut of cars that need discounting to move, if you misunderstood demand.

Ryan Cohen turned an online dog food company into a 3.5 billion dollar company before it sold to Petsmart, he then remained ceo and turned it into like an 9 billion dollar company before he stepped down as ceo, it's now worth nearly 40 billion. 

If he turned Gamestop into a 3.5 billion dollar company the stock price would be \~$50. Do you think people are more interested in buying dog food online or video games and electronics?

Only one catalyst deserves to be considered for a squeeze and that is a share recall for a proxy vote. Cohen has to present nominees (probably in March) for a majority slate board. If we see that transpire then there is a good chance we will see some material covering all at once sometime in March. Check April 2020 when the last proxy vote led to some shares being recalled. Share price doubled in a week. A lot less SI back then and not all longs recalled like they probably would this time around.

Outside of that scenario this is just a play for a price re-rating to FMV of somewhere between $3-4bn.

Partially agree.  I think with most stocks right now, if you jump out 2 years, predict their earnings and discount ~20% from a fair price, we're about right even though current p/e ratios are astronomical.   

Spec plays, no idea whats right.  Cruises are established though.  Theyre not growth stocks.   Im bullish on cruises, i just think ath is a bit further out for them.

“Using digital numbers that come from nowhere to buy assets from banks is not printing money because my definition of money is that dollars are only created when banks lend” lol this is such a ridiculous pedantic argument over semantics.

Most importantly, do you think QE has any impact on banks’ willingness to lend? In other words, are you contending that QE does not directly lead to more “money printing” by your definition than otherwise would exist if not for QE? Or are you just here to project your semantics

Even if Tesla completely fails in terms of their goals. They are worth $5000 in 2030 with 2-3 million cars made per year.

Even with a 10% discount rate the stock is super attractive right now.

Realistically Tesla’s worth $8k in 2026 and $16k in 2030. They haven’t even entered the growth phase. It really doesn’t matter what the stock price in 1-2 years, when the true value realizations are in 2024 onwards.

At the very worst Tesla will make 1.2 million cars in 2023. That’s a lot.

Prob because mortgage originators are not growth stocks... they're part of financials which as we all know never moves.

Completely agree, so I'm not sure if you're referring directly to me in your latter paragraph.

As I said at the outset, I'm absolutely bullish on Tesla - but to the extent that one should have been bullish on Microsoft in 2000. I wouldn't be surprised if (when) Tesla becomes another multi-trillion dollar company. If Tesla drops 90% (back to January 2020 prices), I will probably go long (in fact, I was long in January 2020).

But like you said, that will take time. The underlying business needs to catch up to its valuation and the RSUs need to straighten themselves out (which was the theme of Bloomstran's thread).

Consoles will stay because local computation has advantages over doing it remotely that will never go away unless they figure out how to create connections using quantum entanglement - the speed of light is the limiting factor in the responsiveness of electrical and optical connections. 

So as long as that remains the case, it will always be better to have the computer close to the input and output devices rather than further away.

Tbh if she’s got the face I’d invest. Chick I was talking about ended up losing the weight and now she’s a solid 8.5/10.

Why would MMs want to tank the first trading day of a new year. It’s such a nice occasion to have a 3% rally and then fuck retail for the next week.
Suck me automod.
And nightly
Started at 784K, up to 909K, down to 648K, and closed the year at 1.32M.  Up 513K, 63.5% gain (across personal, Roth, roll over, and 401K)
I bang 18 black chicks and do drugs like a degenerate while working 70 hours a week and absolutely killing it with TSLA calls this year. Flair me accordingly. I demand it.
I think the one thing that needs to be watched is how they do going forward. 2020 was an abnormal year and the question is whether or not their price point remains attractive fit buyers in 2021.
Just buy 5% of every ticket mentioned = retard etf

Lol, I forgot about calls on SPCE. It’s a terrible enough company that calls might print regardless of aliens.

Yeah it's weird, some chains have way more OI and better spreads than others, e.g. June 2021 vs July 2021.

Just bid the mid, you will get a seller 90% of the time. Remember, this play is not about making a 30,40 or 50% return. This trade is about maximizing payoff convexity, so realistically you are seeking 1,000 or 10,000% returns. Paying more for fat spreads should not be an issue given the size of the expected payoff.  This is contingent on buying deep enough OTM, which will steepen your P/L curve during an inflation triggered black swan event.
Good, I'm glad you think so. Invest that way and help me out.

Gave my 2 year old daughter a wallet for christmas.  Typical girl's wallet, with a zipper and a loop to hold on the wrist.

A moment ago she walked up to me holding the wallet and says, "you wanna see?"  I say sure.  She slowly works the zipper on the wallet.  "wanna see?  wanna see?  you see dada?"

Not sure what I was expecting her to have in there, but it was certainly not a dozen dried up slices of mandarin oranges.

Weirdly enough the sales guy talked me out of it because he said it was “a car a divorced dad buys for his new girlfriend that he returns in 6 months for half value when she dumps him” lmao

They could but they have to be bought by someone. This is what I mean by a closed system. If they do in fact dump their treasuries and they don’t sell, the price will begin to drop hurting their bottom line. It’s a double edge sword.

People who shop at target disgust me
Buy stocks that actually go up tho
I want to point out one thing with E-Commerce being overcrowded. People are starting to realize that returns are starting to kill profits. Companies are shipping goods for free but also need to start offering free returns. 

Getting FedEx or UPS to do this isn't a free service, it cost money and their cost is only going up as everyone and their mom is getting into e-commerce. At some point the best option is to have drop off locations and GameStop surprisingly is poised for this. Given they have small footprint stores they are basically drop off hubs and customers will see this and rather shop at GameStop over Amazon. Why? Because if I wanted to return a package I can do it easily, Amazon? Wtf I gotta get a hold of customer service who will then ask I return through shipping on my money if the item is perfectly fine etc. 

The company setup to transition into the next level of e-commerce needs to have stores with small retail locations all over the place. Gamestop already has this and not only that gamestop has a ton of cash sitting on the side to reinvest and coming out of this stronger than ever.
I love all these tools, but it’d be cool to see a historical chart of when tickers getting mentioned so we can see when the new meme stinks are starting to get on before the big pump.

Idk what cashflow is talking about with it being jerky. If anything I’d say BMW’s are more jerky with their crappy transmissions.

Never owned an M but have had M-Sport X5’s (multiple) and their transmissions always start acting up at like 100k miles regardless if you do trans services on time or not. 🤷🏾‍♂️

You have to remember it’s a closed system. If they sell, someone has to buy it. So if they can’t immediately offload the treasuries it hurts them as well. US will be fine. China is a major economy but no one trusts them. That’s China’s real problem.

She’s an idiot. BP is one of Palantir’s largest customers. With their Vertex aspect of Foundry, they were able to save BP $57M in 2 weeks. Let me repeat that for you, $57 MILLION in two weeks. 

Oil and gas companies will be flocking to PLTR in the company years if they want a fighting chance of running their business more efficiently. Palantir knows this and are actively trying to acquire more Oil and Gas customers. They have a sales position for Brazil right now targeting their largest private companies. Guess which one is the largest? Brazilian Oil Giant Petrobras.

DeMark is a well known technical in trader who created a whole analytics platform (often quoted at CNBC, Bloomberg etc).  The Golden Ratio is something you find in nature (a sequence which keeps repeating itself over and over).  Wouldn’t say it’s bulletproof but DeMark has been able to identify tops and bottoms quite effectively.  Good luck

I don’t agree with that at all. This should be the biggest catalyst to date for the industry: Blue President, Blue House, Blue Senate. With Mitch McConnell at the helm of the Senate, bills weren’t even allowed to hit the floor for a vote; everything got blocked. With Schumer potentially taking over as majority leader, it’ll be all systems go for those very same bills. They may not all get passed, but they at least get a chance.

The Gentlemen is an okay movie. The more I see Matthew McConaughey the more I think he's at least a little bit overrated as an actor. He doesn't have nearly the acting chops of other hollywood handsomes like pitt, Clooney, DiCaprio, etc. Not to say he's bad though I'm still a big fan of his. Colin Farrell has the strongest performance in the film. Guy who plays Kendall Roy in Succession is also in it.

Movie has a fun concept and is a fun watch, ultimately doesn't live up to its potential imo, plus weed is a boring subject compared to literally every other drug but that's a bit nitpicky.

A lot of bear case is how GME used to do business. And bears are right if GME continues with the old way of doing things. But the fact of the matter is, they are pivoting away from that and planning on doing new things, expanding e-commerce. With this new approach, 99% of the bear thesis become invalidated.

I doubt Cohen came to GME and bought millions in shares just to sell used games.

I did extensive research and this is what I came up with and have tried on or owned these.

RedWings: reliable and long lasting, decent comfort, not the most dressy look. Usually have a mid year sale. Takes awhile to break in.

Thursday Boots: Look great, are comfortable but have quality and durability issues.

Beckett Simonon: Nice quality all around and good price. Decent durability and comfort. Takes a while to ship tho as they are made by hand.

Whites: great comfort, sexy look, awesome customer service and nice feel. Also they have a fathers day sale for 20% off if you can wait.

You can definitely get away with spending 200 on boots and be ok for a few years. The bump to the 300-400 range is they will last a lot longer and a cobbler will be able to resole them which extends the life further. 

Also go about a half step down on size. I wear an 11 1/2 normally but am an 11 in boots.

There are a lot of good reasons to be bullish on gaming in general.

But used game peddlers are viewed as a scourge, the 2nd coming of software piracy, in the eyes of videogame developers, publishers, and most importantly console manufacturers who are relying on getting a 35% cut of every full-price new game sale to make up for selling the hardware on razor-thin margins or even at a loss.

Watching GameStop take most of the profit by re-selling the same game 5 or 10 times, and then WalMart trying to get into the business as well - enough was enough. Everybody in the industry was looking for ways to cut them out, and they were not in a position to control their own destiny.
Lol, that's bullshit. Illegal immigration does not  prevent people from getting a tourist visa. Citation needed.  

Thats some projection, telling the people who don't want others deported that "no actually, you're the racist ones."

Again I personally feel like it is dependent on which one you pick, if weed is legalized on the federal level companies in Canada with more product that sellers will be the ones to benefit from the ability to send it over the border (which they can not do now), but you have to consider how long it might take for that to happen, 

There are some companies that are priced the way they are because people don't expect weed to be federally legalized soon but that states will continue to legalize it, this incentivizes it to be grown instate and such companies might be negatively affected by news that federal legalization might be on the horizon if both Dems win

I agree the weed industry will benefit but that doesn't mean every weed company will

I understand why they do require special ballots and all that since they don't want fraud, but our system does lacks balance and causes those abroad to miss out. Some may think "they should be home then," but our military aren't always home. They deserve the right as much as anyone else.

This, of course, is ignoring the original subject of the USPS having a harder time without sorting machines. And remember, they also have large facilities that would get slowed by COVID, but those sorting machines did a LOT of work. Imagine if it had to be people doing the work.

Yo if I could get a c8 for ~50k I would buy in a heartbeat. They’re just a little too pricey for me rn and I feel like the c7 will drop a ton in value as soon as they start producing more of the c8s and used prices are more reasonable

They raised 15b in offerings this year. Combined with EV credits fuckery, they can engineer growing profits for the next 4-8 quarters until(if) actual profits begin.
Interesting. Last time I checked, it was open with millions of views. The owner must have done something about it.
Because no one wants to talk about how boring Game of Thrones is.  The action scenes are great, but wading through a season worth of episodes that is just a bunch of filler is a snooze fest. I'll Youtube the scene I want to watch. At least Lord of the Rings series is a movie so the pacing is much better and the story is actually enticing.

So just looking at carnival specifically but feels like this applies to all airlines and cruises. Carnival was in the 50’s pre pandemic, and really hasn’t recovered much. Feel like as long as the vaccine rollout goes smoothly (which obviously isn’t a guarantee) these stocks should recover at the very least, and possibly even reach ATH’s with people being so excited to travel again. Carnival 50c for January 2022 are 1.24. Could buy 100 for 12,400. Might go all in, what you tards thinking?

You would have a gain on any GME shares bought this year except if you bought in the final 6 trading days of the year and Nov 30.

Hardly anyone who is long GME is currently holding a losing position.

Plenty of PLTR bagholders tho.
That’s a beautiful car. Almost got one back in 2012 or something but ended up getting a great deal on an 330 e90 instead. Regretted not going for the 335 the whole time I had it tho
PRNT is still a solid play and since it doesn’t have options it doesn’t get memed out of control
Super interesting, I’d have to run the numbers myself to see how much it would actually cost to keep the trade on at different OTM.

I’m attracted to hedges like this because the black swan payout scenario just puts in you such a life-changing position to accumulate other assets on the cheap.

[deleted]
This is an interesting part of the psychology of trading. I found that buying shares or leaps helps with this fear because as long as you don’t pick a dying industry stocks really do only go up and if there is a crash just keep buying so it lowers your cost basis.

So smart and so poor (like most of us). Your DD made me think that you had a good chunk of money on PLTR. I have not done detailed analysis on the IPO vs DPO issue, but I tend to agree 100% with you. Slack was also a direct listing and was mercilessly punished compared to all others until it was announced to be acquired. Palantir could be in the same boat, but I have no way of relating their current price to that. 

Regardless, the photo here says it all. This is a meme stock and it could fly higher until it can justify its price. 

I anticipated PLTR's meme potential when it was at 9-10 and made good change selling calls and puts.
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j2jg0e/daily_discussion_thread_for_september_30_2020/g76js1i/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3

I've experienced how Palantir deals with software partners, they are strategic and focused on building a portfolio across sectors. They are onto something and could be valued higher. I'm thinking on building a long position but it could drop from here (or not) until the next catalyst: effects of the lookout period, Karp's talk, next earnings, or a new high profile contract.

Good luck Palantards!

You proved my point better than i could. PLTR has only been going down lately, even with multiple popular posts per day. WSB is at best a wash, and at worst a force of destruction. The evidence doesn't lie.
Resale is atrocious on convertibles. It's also slower and adds extra elctonics to rape your wallet on top of the already high //M maintainance premium.
Apparently so given the lack of trust in the stock.
Fuck I was all in to buying PLTR till I watched King Karp speak on that youtube link. He looks like Jimmy Savile who is a child predator spanning six decades in the UK. I can't unsee this now.

I think the best way to play this is to continually roll 3-6 month puts as a permanent allocation in a portfolio, at say 2-3% weight.

Sure, there is an opportunity cost to this, BUT, an unexpected rise in inflation would lead to a massive shellacking of all asset prices. Deep TLT puts would go hyperbolic in such an environment, and I would expect a x100 bagger at a minimum, more than enough to pay back your annual 2-3% cost of playing this trade. 

It's the ultimate contrarian, convex trade IMO.

I’m choosing TLRY because the technicals and fundamentals are aligned fantastically right now, and also for the combo of relatively low float and higher short interest. Gains and losses are usually magnified  evasive of that dynamic and in this case if Dems take the Senate, I think it’s a major catalyst for the industry and TLRY will be one of the biggest benefactors of this bull run.

M2 has been an outdated measure since the 70s.  This has been something discussed at FOMC meetings for literally decades.  QE is not money printing.  Do you understand the actual functionality of QE?   It creates bank reserves.  Bank reserves are NOT money.  If commercial banks aren't lending more, money is not being printed.  The fed CANNOT print money.  It is LITERALLY  against the Federal Reserve act.  Have you even glanced at the H8 data?  Commercial credit has been contracting consistently.

Depends on the metric you are using. If you’re looking at overall performance of portfolio through the whole time period then don’t drop since a 2008 event could happen at any point (prob at any time is low but it could happen this year as soon as you start your deploying your strategies or it could happens 20 years down the line). You could potentially run an scenario in which you start with 2008 (the worst case scenario) and see if your account blows up, an alternate scenario from 2009 (the best case) in which the portfolio prob has enough gains through time to see how it holds up in 2020 event

He may also be trying to average down. It's a possibility.

Oh it's not gonna blow up it's just a solid energy play long term
On our channel, we talked about PLTR taking some off the top, as it was pretty overvalued. But of all the companies that are 'overvalued', PLTR is probably the least worthy of great concern. One of the main reasons it has sold off is because there are serious investors that crossed the benefit of holding past the $28 price point. I actually spoke on this in my 3rd Palantir video when discussing the tax implications of recognizing a short-term profit and the appropriate time for that.  Rest assured, if the price continues down to $15-17, there's going to be a lot of fervor to buy back in because it fundamentally has the ability to claim that valuation. Most of the dilution we expected for 2021 has actually already happened in their DPO, so... Trap? Probably not.

Makes a really good point that buying and selling used systems and game equipment online sucks and PowerUp would offer 90day warranties etc and make the experience of buying/selling better and easier.

Monday gonna pump to bait $600 Robinhood gang.

SPY opens $374 and goes up to $376 in the first hour.

Including meme stocks like TSLA and PLTR.

Robinhoods who bought calls at open will act like they’re the next Wolf of Wall Street and mock 🌈🐻s and make wife’s boyfriend jokes like it’s not overplayed.

SPY immediately dumps to $370 on a $2000 stim shot down by senate tweet even though it was obvious.

Robinhoods throw their calls for a loss and starts mass downvoting. It tanks all the way down to $369.07 and flickers into $368.97.

WSBs loads up on puts at this point. Algos buy the dip and this is compounded by 🥭 tweeting “get $2000 stim done meow 😼”

SPY closes $374, completely flat, and theta wins again.

Just buy shares if you lost money last year.

I like your sentiment, and I’m glad you took the time to write this out and share it with us, but I would argue you are right for the wrong reasons. Amazon has for years kept it’s earnings down because it’s constantly pouring its profits into R&D to find the next big thing. They did it building out their amazon prime shipping infrastructure, building AWS which will probably be spun off and become the most valuable company in the world on its own, etc. etc. They could stop spending on R&D any time they wish and earnings would explode upward. This is why a company this large has for many years traded at a P/E of 100-1000. The market largely understands that earnings numbers are artificially low. It’s one of the few companies that has shareholders with a long term mindset and has convinced them that its okay to have no dividend and essentially no earnings and to constantly let them spend every single dollar they make, because it will pay off in the end. So it’s deceiving to evaluate Amazon on an earnings multiple.

Not recent, but in 1922 the founder and CEO of Piggly Wiggly grocery stores borrowed $10M *specifically* to crush short sellers of his company's stock. He was successful at first, driving the stock price from $39 to $124. 

But then, as the bears were getting margin calls up their gay bear asses, the stock exchange changed the rules to favor the bears, and extended the deadline by which the short sellers needed to deliver their shares. The short sellers therefore had lots of time to cover their position. The share price subsequently plummeted.

This effectively bankrupted the CEO who attempted the short squeeze/corner, since he couldn't repay his $10M loan.
Fuck it you might be successful with it man. I’m ok with it, I’ll just hold the shares and wait till it pops. I wish you good luck bro!

I didn't read this post. But I agree.
About the only thing that is located where it should be, is the store page. Everything else in terms of finding what you need, is in a silly spot. For example, the friends list. When you right click on steam from the task bar, it should be one of the most prominent options for easy and quick access... But it's in a random shitty spot. Things like that make steam horrible. 

After like a decade of using steam, it gets really fucking annoying that they've never figured stuff like that out. It could be a much smoother experience, but it just isn't.

Citron shitted on NIO too and look what happened - easiest 5 bagger I made all year and every analyst is screaming buy buy buy.

Compared to SNOW palantir looks cheap.  I have shit on pltr quite a bit, but at $23 it's a decent price for a software ai company that is actually supposed to grow revenue to $1.4 billion next year.  That's no joke for revenue and makes their valuation not too absurd if they can keep growing.  So $30 end of year is totally reasonable and a 30% gain.  But everyone here wants $30 by end of month...

Remember before the election when the narrative was "if Biden gets elected the market will tank"? Remember when it mooned? This is the new iteration of that, and it is equally incorrect. The only thing this economy or the American people care about right now is getting bigger stimulus checks, which will only happen if the democrats win the run up election. More money in the hands of the poor = instant boost to economy, as well as stocks like AAPL mooning.

Not that hard.  Republicans had a slimmed cash-direct stimulus bill for months, but Pelosi insisted on stalling so that she can shove billions of dollars worth of pork into it -- look at the final list of Pelosi pork in the $600 stimulus bill.  Mitch is simply doing the same with the $2,000 stimulus -- but instead of adding pork, he's simply asking to add two mango requested agenda items.

Not turning a profit is a business strategy. It’s completely fine to avoid companies that don’t based on your preference, but Amazon was never a failing company that was saved in the nick of time (if it was ever failing it was during the dot com bubble, still over ten years prior to them actually turning a profit). It poured any money it had into new ventures to expand as quickly and as wide as possible. This isn’t conjecture, Bezos never wanted Amazon to just be a cooler bookstore, they’ve always just diverted funds to industries they think they can disrupt, which is why Amazon does so much random shit. Hit big with AWS which can now fund all kinds of new projects the companies wants to take on. Same reason they still don’t pay a dividend.

Obviously doesn’t mean every company not turning a profit or losing money is solid, they could also just be a bad business, but for up and coming tech companies intentionally losing money to ramp up R&D and marketing is completely normal. You can’t just look at a company not turning a profit and assume it *can’t* turn a profit. That’s really where the distinction lies and how a lot of them live so long off of investor dollars, not because they are in dire shape but because they convince investors that the ROI on development and marketing will be much higher than if they slow down to go in the black.
PLTR might not fail, but that doesn't mean your calls won't expire worthless if PLTR fails to moon fast enough.

Disagree on the tech dip... More blues means more lockdowns means more video games / delivery / online shopping / wfh / etc. I bet they go flat either way.

We heard what you were saying back in September, October, November, and the same story in December.  After every pump and then a dip, “squeeze already happened”, “should’ve sold last week” etc.  

GME pumps after any sort of news. I’m thinking it goes back up to 21-22 before 1/15 and then go back down again due to shorts trying to suppress the price but they won’t be able to keep this up for much longer.

Oh they will hit just shy of $2 trillion without a doubt in my mind. 

They're at about $30 billion for this year, ballpark, so just calculate 50% growth per year (or 40 if you want to be cautious). That's, what, three years of growth to get to two trillion or in that range anyway. So around $120 billion in revenue, but probably will be higher.

Right. Cuz TSLA is a boomer car company. Right?
Use this to calculate your profit range if the option was to be exercised: [https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/calculator/long-call.html)

I don't think there is a calculator that can show you how options would be valued overtime since there are far too many variables affecting them but let's say you were to buy 16th Sep 2022 $135 CALL on AAPL you'd have to pay about $2385 and your breakeven would be $158.85. Which is about 20% from current levels. That means each $1 increase after $158.85 would net you $100 profit per contract. If the price ends up going to $175 in 2 years, you'll make $1615 in profit, about $65%.

The better question is, is that worth doing and basically locking capital for 21 months or so.

Also, if you don't understand options, I just say don't buy... but then again, we all think differently and have different risk levels.

Yo dude, dont just dump your money into something you don't understand. I'm a student too, and I've traded stocks for like the last 3-4 years and still haven't come to fully understand the game yet. Just starting to dabble in options.

Go watch some YouTube videos or read investopedia or something to learn about stocks/market/options first and don't be tempted to dump your money into something just because you're seeing people post their gain porn. The opportunities will always be there, your job is to learn how to spot them and until you feel confident in doing so. 

Read the sub, read what people post but don't take their word for it, do your own research, see if you feel the same way they do with the information provided. Thats how you'll learn.

[https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com](https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com) \- you can use this to calculate profit from options but I'm not sure how accurate it is. 

Goodluck.

On one hand they did get pretty dam close to half a million where I would say this is fine to say. On the other hand they missed there target of 500000 cars cause you don’t round a target u either hit it or you don’t. They beat expectations. Imo they where close enough where you should just give it to them, plus we are in the middle of a pandemic. On the other hand I fully expect a bunch of news saying they missed there target, legit not sure how it should impact the price. If people feel like going crazy and selling like crazy cause of this I guess I’ll go shopping for some more stock.

SCO doesn't buy you shares, wtf? It just shorts a call.

How retarded is this sub????
Worst that happens if you are exercised is that you make some money on both your shares and the premium (assuming you bought the shares at a lower price). Afterwards you can sell covered puts at 25.5 to buy the stock back at that price if it goes back down, or buy the stock back immediately if it hasn't risen too much. With the premium you got from the CC you'll able able to buy them back at a price slightly higher than 25.5 without taking a loss. I also have a cc for EOW but at 26.5.

Anyways, I don't see this stock shooting that much past 25.5 by EOW. It's been on a bearish trend recently. I have long 26.5 calls for 1/29 but I'm banking on the stock rising before the demo on 1/26.
It'll probably fall or stay flat this next week.

You are not the correct LVL for this area
This is the way
It seems the opposite is happening, based on my reading. You see, in 2009 Tesla produced only one car. A bespoke-luxury roadster built on a Lotus Elise frame. So their market share was infinitesimal. In 2010, they began working on a second car, which went on sale in 2012. At the same time, most manufacturers were capable of producing and selling ten to fifteen thousand electric cars per year. The leaf was selling 30k a year by 2012 when Model S sales began. Today, the Leaf is selling less than 20k per year. 

In the same timeframe, Tesla has mad the S, the 3, the X, and the Y. Nissan still just sells the Leaf.

If we're being serious, comparing Leafs to Teslas is the worst sort of smooth brain thinking.

Well.... I used to have 200,000 Twitter followers and 55,000 Instagram followers many years ago before censorship and wokeness took over. Was anonymous (never posted my face) and I’d just show off my body in ways other guys don’t. It would attract a lot of unwanted gay guy attention. Which makes sense bc I was wearing thongs, even though I did it so girls would compliment my butt. But then they started offering me money for stuff like that and yeah it went from there.
All due to the lack of medical care for conditions other than covid. For example, a shunt for someone with heart disease is "elective surgery." There needs to be an investigation into the media and into the medical industry. Someone needs to hang for this.

Palantir Has a $20 Billion Valuation and a Bigger Problem: It Keeps Losing Money

Behind this hot startup image, Palantir has struggled to live up to its reputation.

The company has begun planning an initial public offering but hasn’t turned an annual profit in its 14-year history. It is trying to win more corporate customers, after years of flailing attempts, although some potential clients view Palantir as flippant toward business and are wary of its work for governments and intelligence agencies. It missed sales targets last year after hoped-for contracts fell through.

Its engineers were accustomed to spending profligately—the company sponsored 13-course tasting-menu lunches with lobster tail and sashimi at headquarters—calling such extravagance “Palantir Entitlement Syndrome.”

You know, most people would just ignore this and move on, but I went on a brief school trip overseas which involved a lot of drinking and partying, but one point that always stuck out to me was a night club we went to where a bouncer decided they needed to throw someone out.

One of the students hosting us explained that the bouncer was studying at a school that was well known for athletics.  He ended up being a really nice guy.

Yeah it initiates a purchase by you of 500 shares at 47 then a sale to them for the shares at 47. Your only real risk is the loss of premium paid and any broker fees incurred. The only time you’re at risk of unlimited losses is when you’re selling naked calls and puts.
Omg you’re my fucking nibba. Girls fucking feel so insecure around me bc I have a nicer ass than most of them. But it’s a nice convo starter, I’ve had so many cute girls approach me in the gym to mention I have a nice ass and how they’ve never seen any guy with an ass like that lol. 

That’s why I loved working out in different gyms each time it was glutes day hoping new girls would notice me and say something 😂

Completely agree but a positive catalyst or another 13D purchase could send the stock up 25%+ for a day or two in a row before it pulls back to a reasonable price. Long term it will most likely be slow but no reason it can’t organically grown to $40 by April ER
2 3 day weekends in a row is killer on my gambling addiction.
Sure they could have oil companies but again, don't see how oil prices being currently down affects the short term share price when their contracts are usually 3-5 years. The downtrend seems to be more from tax selling and fund rebalances rather than specifically the oil and gas industry.
Most of us need to stay home because of restrictions so we die less maybe.

I’ve made 50k on calls bought around $14 and dumped at $30 and puts bought at $31 but congratulations, your plan to baghold a 17 year company for another 17 years in the hopes of maybe squeezing out a profit sounds noble.
People Lie Too Real
Personally I've noticed the closer it gets to the 22 range the articles released starting to change in tune.  At first it was its overvalued sell now or stay away.  But now I'm seeing more and more of buy and hold or keep your eye on this one.

As a random dumbass without the same credentials, I disagree with your disagreement.
It is not comparable.  VW is a german company.  Lots of german companies trade with 2 share classes. a voting share class and a non-voting share class.  Usually the voting shares trade at a small premium.

&#x200B;

In the case of VW, the premium on the voting shares got to insane levels to the point where they thought it was free money to short the spensive shares and buy the cheap hoping the spread would collapse.

enter porsche who was attempting to take control of VW and thus was only interested in acquiring voting shares.  porsche's buying led to a massive share squeeze because hedge funds couldn't unwind their long/short trade.  

&#x200B;

so there was a vw squeeze but it came right back to earth.

&#x200B;

Think about Ryan Cohen - how does a share squeeze help him?  Unless he's done buying the stock forever, he wants to pay a cheap price not a moon price.  And GME, maybe foolishly, announced their share sale plans which will probably put a cap on any real squeeze.  Maybe management is even selfish enough to start dumping shares close to these levels... i hope not.

&#x200B;

Either way, the potential squeeze could add nice juice but it seems like everyone is planning to sell at the slightest whiff of a ss - management included.

&#x200B;

Best thing for shareholders is to force a long, forced, covering of the current short position based on improving fundamentals and a solid turnaround plan from RC or maybe the management.

&#x200B;

The reduction in ss pressure should, over time, help the stock to move higher.  this kinda happened with tesla.  

&#x200B;

hope that was helpful

Of all the opportunities out there in the market, these retards are pouring their money into a company that’s so bad, the only thing making it go higher is the staggering percent of short interest.

[deleted]
I do those too. Whole stack. Girls stare in awe at my amazing toned butt cheeks
$50 only seems absurd if you don't understand share price in relation to market cap. $50/share only gives GME a $3.5bn market cap. Historically that is quite low for GME during a console cycle as they have previously been valued at 9.5bn (PS3) and 6.5bn (PS4). 

Also people playing GME solely for a short squeeze are just trying to make money by exploiting market dynamics which can supersede fundamentals for a brief period of time. It becomes a math equation. Shorts need to get out and have to buy in order to do so, raising the share price for a short period of time. Squeeze traders are simply trying to capture that momentary upside. Has nothing to do with investing. Just a quick trade exploiting weaknesses in how the market operates. Most of WSB is involved in GME not to invest in the actual company, but to profit off the shorts getting burned by Cohen's involvement.

They got backed up to hell in some areas because of the sorting machines they were ordered to dismantle. The workers even came out and said there's nothing wrong with the machines. The person who ordered it was the guy put in charge via Trump. I can't remember his name now, DeJoy?

The dismantling began around when mail ballots were being sent out iirc. Because of that, people were being told to send their ballots in way earlier than necessary plus the time it took to receive the ballots was longer for some. All in all, there were people at the end (anecdotally at least) who argued that ballots that didn't make the date shouldn't count, but the ballots were stuck in the mail system due to the system being intentionally slowed.

Hell, I got a bud in Japan who said they never even got their ballots to vote at all. He was gonna vote Trump, ironically enough.

GDP goes up too, especially as Tesla is part of GDP. And they're multinational. China has 1.4 billion people, Europe has 700 million; TSLA is in no way limited by the US GDP. 

I mean, trillion was a word anyone really contemplated 10 years ago, and Apple is a multitrillion dollar company now. 

It sounds really big isn't an actual criticism of a thesis. 

And yep, I know about the last 10% being hard. We're still getting it this year. Someone has already driven from SF to LA, with two stops in between, zero interventions. It's already screamingly close.

I don’t know much about PLTR, but they have their Washington post discussion event about the Covid response this week. Seems like not an idea time to sell calls.
I traded monthlies on ICLN, TAN and ARKs. Sold mid December right when you guys started talking about them a lot. 

I bought some ARKG April $95 calls on 11/30 for $225. Sold those puppies two weeks later for $1500 a piece.

-Palantir lacks compelling competitive advantages

-investors differ on whether Palantir is a software maker or a less appealing consulting company.

-very large forward price-sales multiple of 33.

I’m a SPY in sky kinda guy, but honestly can think how much of a force this sub would have with very little coordination? 

Like a set group of autist who set share prices; that way we know all know what WSB’s fair to buy in is. Looking at you $33 Pltr gang. 

DD checkers; less pump in dump, and more security for longer holds. We’d all walk away richer as we’d fundamentally recreate a resilient layer of resistance. Something larger firms already can and do, and we wouldn’t be aware.

Stocks could see their hay days of paper trading return. Thousands of tards all clambering for who’s name will be apart of history; Who delivered the unlimited bagger? 

Meme already demonstrate sentiment better then any charts. I know people in here who would ‘diamond hands’ pltr to the ground, because they believe in it (me included). I’m positive about this though, because  it’s memes are still pumped for karma and get it. 

Half the austim is glued to the charts and screens and we’ve already seen how that lets us see huge moves made at sneaky times. $GME movement lately is weird, youd have to agree there.
What color lambo tho
You're spot on, but your first mistake was trying to convince a room full of gamblers that their "guaranteed play" is more likely to drop 80% than to be a 5-bagger.

They've never heard of the concept of gross margins(Palantir's are pretty weak for a "software company" at \~60-65%), and they don't understand what a company trading at 35x trailing and 25x forward sales means(the moment growth slightly slows, that multiple gets crushed).

Ignore them, and just cherish the day your puts print in 2021. Until then, let these people keep pumping something they don't understand. If you tell them they're wrong, they'll only attack you like they did here.

We gotta have a decently high IQ combined.
I believe the general consensus is that they are reinvesting the money. Do you have info showing that they are not?

Not being dickish-I don’t own any shares in pltr-but I’m considering it as an investment.
Though fair warning:

* seems like on the reddit subs the subject of TSLA is getting very heated.

With the current situation, I'd say it can have a pretty nice green week, however, there may be some darker times coming up. Though after that papa musk will not let us down!!!

Sounds kinda gay tbh
Well, the scary part is that no, something does not *have* to happen. It's possible that they flounder to find direction until they bottom out. That's where the blockbuster comparison is not tired and lazy, but accurate and logical. Saying it's "tired" just means you are tired of hearing it. Saying it's "lazy" just means that you think it's obvious. Those are emotional labels. I agree that it is *possible* for the business to turn around. They have not, however, presented any evidence that they will or even a viable direction that they are going to try. All "the bears" are saying is that right now any positive sentiment is just wishful thinking. There is no plan for success right now. Hopefully they communicate something in their next ER or an independent PR. 

Right now this is a gamble at best... and the table's not looking friendly.

Uber had a market cap of almost $100B+ before they “sold” their autonomous vehicle unit... so how does Tesla get the $600B+ valuation? 

Break it down and you’ll see there are gaps. Toyota has a market cap of $250B. Toyota + Uber = $350B so where’s the other $300B in value? 

And you’re going to tell me that Tesla is somehow worth Toyota and 4 Ubers?!

>California funeral homes run out of space as COVID-19 rages

>“I’ve been in the funeral industry for 40 years and never in my life did I think that this could happen, that I’d have to tell a family, ‘No, we can’t take your family member,’” said Magda Maldonado, owner of Continental Funeral Home in Los Angeles.

>Continental is averaging about 30 body removals a day — six times its normal rate. Mortuary owners are calling one another to see whether anyone can handle overflow, and the answer is always the same: They’re full, too.

They are the Salesforce of big data. $CRM brought a clean SaaS with customizable interface to manage customer relationships for basically any industry bespoke for each individual company. 

Palantir brings a clean SaaS for managing and analyzing huge disparate sets of data. This is extremely useful in government and mid to large size companies. Boeing for example identified huge cost savings by using $PLTR to look at manufacturing/supply chain/maintenance data sets.

I don't even know what PLTR provide as a company, and what kind of advantages or competition they have in their field, and at this point I'm too afraid to ask...
If it were me I'd wait 18 months with plans and funds ready, there will be a dip if there are rate adjustments, when that happens you can take advantage of the situation and provide work to contractors. I think it will bounce back pretty quickly when it happens.

I have only dealt with metal framing in commercial applications, but you are right, lumber prices might drive people to metal sooner. I'd look at Foam if I were you, I saw a six-plex by me built with it, and a 15,000  sqft home. That may be better.

For what it's worth, I think construction is good for a year to 18 months. I have 500 shares of GHIV (SPAC for United Wholesale Mortgage), and I've been selling covered calls on them for a few weeks.

Ecommerce and Digital transformation play.  when the economy opens up again you are going to have tons of old companies that will invest in digital transformation. There is also a void that will have to be filled from all the companies that went out of business. they will be replaced by younger, more digitally savvy business owners who will position their businesses as omni channel.
Why tune it out in the green if tuning in is what gets you back there in this plan? Switch back to the losing strategy once you've successfully applied yourself back in the positive? I'm just trolling ya, do you mean being glued to the price movements?

Couldn’t agree more, T is gonna surprise everyone and could go to $40+ by mid late 2021.  The best part is the IV is sooooo low. The $28 C leaps to 01-21 are only $250 and the IV is under 20%.  Once it starts to get some traction it will increase so get them while they last (low to high IV = huge appreciation on call options).

Hey Cortana, what is a Palinteer?
Upvoted for spelling faze correctly.

edit: 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I was a Tesla shareholder since their ipo, and thus a former fan boy who’s seen the co develop and change. I bought the second one after the first was a lemon because their customer service was second to none and was a company that was willing to learn from their mistakes and make things right. 

After model 3 production hell mid 2018, Tesla cut costs and thus customer service. They started pretending things were in spec, and issues don’t exist to avoid costs. Great for short term financials, but will bite them in the ass long term.

Following that change, my opinion on the company has changed and I definitely wouldn’t buy a Model S/X again. The service is just trash for the price of the car today.

At the same time I won’t sell my car and take that depreciation hit at this point. Once another automaker comes up with something close, I’ll probably do it but not today.

Musk is obviously super libertarian and patriotic, fanboying the CCP wouldn't make much sense. 

He's sometimes quite robotic and literal, especially in awkward situations, I think he just said the last thing he had on his mind without considering the bigger picture of Chinese politics. Also this guy has 0 filter, sometimes it makes him go against literally everyone with a brain (covid), sometimes that's^ what comes out. And he doesn't think in black & white, liking and hating parts of Chinese culture isn't mutually exclusive. + He has an extremely open mind. So all in all it makes sense, although it caught me off guard
This is true, Palantir doesn't have a wide range of private customers yet. Oil companies are responsible a significant portion of the private revenue.

Fuck yeah brother. I'm long on this. Don't even look at it every day. Ok I still look at it every day. Multiple times per day.
Any insight on why-- was it Tesla, Charles Schwabb, Oracle, HP, Palantir, some hundred or so others-- are relocating out of Cali?

I've heard that Cali has \~8% corporate tax, so that's similar to the 21 -> 28% proposed federal increase, and that's one of the main reasons these tech companies are relocating. Obviously moving to Utah is easier than moving to Greece, but still... That must have some impact on the Cali economy?

For what it's worth, I make iPhone cases, and rough estimate, the 12 Pro case is outselling the 12 by over 10 to 1. The 12 Mini is also doing well, about 6 to 1. The 12 Pro Max is about 2 to 1.

I've got a Drake wallet I've had for about 6 years and it's held up nicely.  They have a large silver logo, but you can take it off.
The reason everyone is buying GME shares, is because lots of money has been spent on GME short bets. To exit a short bet on GME, those people have to buy GME stocks. So, those people with short bets on GME are going to be forced to buy GME stocks at our inflated prices. But what inflated price should we sell at, to avoid being the last idiot holding GME shitty stocks as it tumbles down into oblivion?

Get a Louis Vuitton so you can show off
I disagree I think their balance sheets show enough cash to pivot to R&D to try and become a sustainable business given the right direction. Im not in for the squeeze. Im in because I believe it has potential to be something more. The tired old argument that this is just another blockbuster is tired and lazy. I think if you look at any credible DD it doesn't take long to see there's some valuation here. I agree with you that they do need to have a clear direction that the company will become and I believe we will hear that in the next ER or if RC ventures takes over. Something has to happen

4k shares and 2.7k or whatever in weeklies.

Yawn.
Sure but 100x is a $67T valuation. The current entire GDP of the US $20.5T. I get that GDP is a very different thing than a valuation but for a single company to have 3x the US GDP is insanity. 

Who knows, maybe if they hit all their milestones you could see 10x in a bubble. I’m a big fan of TSLA and have been holding shares since 2017. Ive been slowly selling shares but will hold probably 90% of what I have left long term. Definitely selling more if they hit $1,000/share quickly. I’ve seen enough bubbles in my trading life.

Edit: accomplishing the last 10% of FSD will be 100x harder than the first 90%.

I got into liquid oxy in 2006 and had no idea why I was miserably sick when I went to Cali. I used to jack pints of oxy fast every week. When that came to an end I had to work real jobs to support my habit. Then cocaine happened. I was an upper level iOS advisor and lost my job because I went to jail over my ex self harming and blaming. I got a record with companies like TSLA AAPL under my belt. My E*TRADE has each one linked. I’m almost 40, living with parents and woman I don’t love that way. I punched my TV and it cut my wrist and I got sent away and put on pills. I was a zombie until October. I get fired from crappy temp jobs because my record. It was a crisis. I focused on the market last two months and got real nice. I began trade school where records aren’t as sedative. I’ve never had more saved. I’ve never had a clearer path.

Yeah she want a slice. I got chuckie cheese
thanks? i guess? haha im still not sure what's going on. I did NOT hold any shares, i BOT the put on 5 contracts, and it expired in the money by a kittens whisker. It seems like it was automatically exercised on expiration since it was in the money, but there was breakeven of roughly $46.46 with premium to purchase which is where im coming up with the $200 loss. i am trying to understand what i need to do first thing money to close this or sell it as i cant afford to lose$23,000 or more. I always thought buying a put resulted ineither a worthless option expired or that i got the spread between the put price and market price? Once again,, any help greatly appreciated! I am wondering if it showing as -500 shares that i've 'bought' and will then on 1/05/21 'put' those to the seller of the put at $47?

1. $990 - any commissions

2. There are only two options of a covered call if you hold till expiry.

Option A underlying stock closes above the strike price so using your example above, if stock closes at say $36 day of expiry you sell 1100 at $35 (and of course you keep your premium which you collected when you sold the calls) effectively you bought shares at $32 and sold at $35.90 (strike + premium)

Option B the underlying closes below the strike price on expiry. You keep your stocks and the premium you collected. This effectively lowered your cost basis on the stocks you owned (1100 at 31.10) you can repeat the process as long as the stock price doesn’t go too far down and the premiums you get aren’t worth it.

Steam really only has 1 product, videogames. GameStop.com has a very diversified product mix. Can't replace a company when they sell 1000 other products that you don't.

Blockbuster and Netflix both shared the same product. Movies sales/rentals. That is it. Netflix replaced Blockbuster because they did the same thing, except much better. 

Steam or stadia (lol not sure if serious) could never replace GameStop.com because although they sell a similar product, GameStop.com is too diverse for Steam to fully replace them in the category.
Come on I’m long too but this is so unrealistic

I'm new to the whole technical analysis game, but isn't this pretty contested? I get wedge/triangle is usually a continuation pattern, but not always, and it's even a descending wedge which is a bad sign, right? I think the only thing you can conclude is, "people don't know what to do right now, so they're sitting on their hands". From what I understand as well, the closer the triangle gets to it's point, the LESS explosive the inevitable change is. Or am I reading my book wrong?
I felt that too. Initially they let me win with repeated full houses, and then I started having crazy bad beats. Plus nobody talked on the chat. I got out after losing a bit. Shit is rigged
By April 15th I’ll either have 10x my trading account or 0.  Don’t want to owe $50k if I’m at 0.  This is the way.
But they don't. The number of physical game sales has been dropping off a cliff for the past 5 years. In 2018 over 83 percent of all computer and video games were sold in digital format.

The important thing you should take from this thing, is consistency, You are being good at that. Now just bet the damn opposite of what you were thinking!
Wouldn't it be cool if you could book a time slot and watch them do the build of your new PC that you bought from them.

You customize online, maybe do an online walk-through with a real expert to make sure everything will work together nicely for the games you want to play (15 mins tops, upsell a few things without being pushy - make it practical changes that add value to their personalized needs), then get your time slot and go down to the local GameStop to watch them build it. Builder could suggest some value adds like LED lights and other customizations. 

Maybe start with key locations where you can get enough interest to put someone on this 100% so that customers are watching experienced builders do their thing. It's all about the experience and customer delight. Keep both interactions to an hour total and just charge a flat rate for the experience that feels worth it to the customer.

I can actually picture a few of the online interactions that would be amazing for this (both for the customers and employees).

Sorry, didn't think I'd type that much. Hopefully my rambling just shows how much of a retard I am. Something something something rocket emoji moon!

GME is up over 100% in the last few months and over 200% in the last year. I know the bankruptcy was probably good and they are making seemingly better decisions but how high do people actually think its going to go? I've seem people talking about $50 and $100 but that seems absurd and if you don't sell during a squeeze like that you'd be totally fucked backholding the after effects right?

Feb 19th 32C go for 1.30, you can't 'lose' but the stock can go down further in the mean time.  Best case scenario is the stock closes below 31.99 on the 19th. The stock did just bear flag and break 26p moving average so it wouldn't surprise me if there is future downside. If it dumps at least you lowered your cost basis.

Good job dumping 35k into a meme stock at the peak. 

I'd honestly just write down the bid/ask for a specific strike/expiration and keep checking quotes, or make an investopedia paper trading account or something.

Ban
Most brokerages charge $0.65 per transaction for options (you can negotiate for less if you do a lot of volume). So some back of the napkin math means $1800 in fees divided by 0.65, which is the total number of contracts I bought and sold. That number is 2769. 2769 is the total number of contracts that were bought and/or sold

You’d assume I’d have the same amount of contracts bought and sold, but that’s not the case. I had plenty of contracts that expired worthless like any other autist here would, so I didn’t have to pay anything to sell them because I had 💎🙌

Well again they're up something like 17x since 2014.

It would be a huge deal if dems take Senate control. An R Senate will make it difficult to pass significant green energy spending and initiatives without making concessions elsewhere or seriously watering down the bills.

If the Dems win, there's a much higher chance of significant government money flowing into the sector and money going out of oil, nat gas, and coal.

Tesla is betting that FSD saves them from that. And it's perfectly willing to license out its EV tech to everyone, afaik. I think the Chinese companies have other issues to solve, like manufacturing efficiency and how charging is gonna work. 

Tesla also lets other companies use it's Superchargers.
The reason they let tsla go in without capital ownership restrictions is to stimulate their own EV business. Same as how the first wave of google, msft, etc stimulated their Chinese counterparts.

What else is there... Cash? No one's gonna do that.

All depends on what stock and the hype around it. Most companies don’t go up 70% in a year let alone a day. If you still believe in the company and that happens again just sell half and let the rest ride. If it dips down you can always buy more shares with your profits
Will definitely look for your post tomorrow for sure. Im not a bear or a bull, like i said i have no skin in the game. Its just that so many GME post lately so i came in to take a look. I dont know whichever IQ camp i below to, maybe i belong to the low one haha who knows.

Personally, my investment sector is in fintech, genome and EVs. Just as a gamer and retail investor its always good to do case study and learn about things that you dont know and see how others do deductions and learn from different angles that can broaden my own views and understanding which will help in my own sector of investment.

To be fair, P/S is one of the highest but we still have room to chase SNOW. Q4 earnings should shrink that P/S. Those of us with ITM LEAPs and shares are not worried. This YOLO isnt even that reckless by WSB standards but I am betting on mid 30s EoY, not in 2 weeks. 

As far as why we are bullish? Its a good product in a developing market. Ill admit I jumped on the rocket early with little research (my DD consisted of confirming the Bin Laden story). Deciding to hold took actual DD and everyone I talk to with first hand experience says they have a good product and well engineered code.  Smooth brains that say "I cud write SQL to do same thing" dont work for multinational corporations with dozens of independent ERP systems and kind of miss the point.

To be very brief, AI these days (which isn't sentient, btw, so the term is a bit misleading) is most often employed in methods to create a model which then can suck in all data, analyze, categorize and record it, then use that data to improve the original model's concepts and "reactability".  For instance, Google maps uses this sort of framework to constantly improve their directions by analyzing your location data.  This is what data analysis is.  As for PLTR, I dont even know what their specific field is, but supposedly it's a very well designed data analysis model.

Not comparing the two, but amazon didn't turn a profit for 20+ years. And if it wouldn't have been for AWS they probably still wouldn't. 

They are re-investing, or you may know it as YOLOING, all their money back into their own company.

But anyway buy some in pre-market on Monday, and then wait and see what happens at open. If it dips more I'll buy some extra

You’re looking at wrong.

Imagine a man at a casino.  He has $100 dollars.  

He can eat a meal for $50 and gamble $50 on a random number in roulette.(btw: his odds of hitting his number are 38:1, and it pays out 35:1)

Or he can eat a cheap $10 meal and gamble $90.  He may think he’s getting food just the same and has an extra $40 to gamble but his logic would be flawed like your’s.

He’s taken the value of a quality meal and bet that.  Like your haircut.  You may be saving money but what you’re trading in is a quality haircut.  

What I’m saying is, you’ve bet your quality of life on the chance of an extravagant life.  If you lose, you’ve traded in your quality of life for nothing.  

If you had invested less and still lost %100, at least your quality of life would’ve remained the same.  

So if you win, big win.  If you lose, it’s like loss cream on top of a loss cake.  True autist.
Depends on what kinda sushi he was talking about. I hope it wasn’t hooker sushi...

Briefly?  Their current market cap prices in unobtainable expectations.  Their price is *at least* 10-15 years ahead of the current company's operations. It's totally plausible that the underlying company moons but stockholders lose money due to multiple compression.

Add to this that a large portion of Tesla's "salary" expense is comprised of RSU/stock options. What happens when these are eventually exercised and sold to market? Tesla, like many high tech growth companies, will be forced to repurchase shares to prevent dilution to existing shareholders. This will be impossible since this alone would require (at least) a year's worth of revenue.

I'm not stupid enough to open up a large short position on Tesla, but I wouldn't be surprised at all if we see a downward cascade in the share price. 

Remember: a **90% decline** would bring Tesla back to **January 2020** prices.
Agreed. I think it’s funny I got downvoted by the IPOD and IPOF crew who didn’t want me to be right 😂

Normal stocks turn 5k into 8k

Penny stocks turn 2k into 200k

Your choice liberal 😎😎😎

(Assuming, of course, that the stocks go up, which they always do)
Look at the pattern on the chart, though.  It does this.  Another 🚀 fueling up this week
😂

2024, start driverless robotaxis(late!) Start with a fleet of 2 million, charge 1 dollar per mile, each car 100k miles per year, 60% efficiency - so 60k money making miles. Revenue is 60 cents a mile. Say cost is ten cents a mile(way, way high), 50k profit per car per year. Thats 100 billion profit per year. 

Grow the fleet 50% a year - Tesla has done at least this since 2014 - you get 98 million cars in 2030. Dump the price to the federal write off for mileage - 58 cents a mile. Lower the cost per vehicle to 4 cents a mile. That's 35 cents revenue per vehicle per year. . 31 cents profit. 31,000 profit per year.  30k x 100 million cars is 3 trillion dollars profit per year. 33x that for market cap of 100 trillion, or 100k per share. Which would be a bit more than 100x, and ignores every other thing the company gets revenue from. 

I'd give it a 25/20%. I think the production/year will top out lower than that, but I also think efficiency will be way higher and the multiplier will be higher. The big problem with this thesis was FSD, and I'm 100 percent sure they'll solve it this year. Next problem is regulators, which I think will be quicker than 2024.  Neither demand nor competition will be an issue by 2030. They don't have the data to solve general FSD, and they dont have the scale or efficiency to be as cheap as Tesla. They could license Tesla's stuff... by paying Tesla.
Will likely mean bullish for clean energy, weed stocks. Bearish for banks and finance for increased regulation.

In general slightly bullish as they would bring political stability and markets love predictability.

QUANTUM COMPUTING (f\*\*k PLTR and f\*\*K da po-lice)

Recently entertaining a massive hard-on for quantum computing -- figuring that the ridiculous growth in data volumes/processing has already exceeded both legacy (Oracle) and modern (Snowflake, Big Query, Aurora, Azure) data architecture capacity and the only real future lies with companies who can tackle improved speed, energy efficiency and larger computational payloads.  

**Q.UBT** :  OTC mkt but these cats have **applied for NASDAQ uplisting LAST WEDNESDAY** and will get far more investor traction and inflow once complete, as the ONLY publicly traded company in pure-play quantum.  Highest level autists working here - serious recent breakouts, just getting started.

**DOMO**: Pure-play cloud analytics  - market cap 1.9B - massive recent breakouts after idling for a long time; still priced cheap af ; investors include Bezos and Benioff -- super likely candidate for acquisition.  CEO Joshua James = experienced (sold last co. to Adobe for 1.8B) and eccentric.

Time to get serious about your analytics plays you retard fgs.  PLTR and its tree-hugging tweaker-master are NOT interested in hypergrowth or profitability.  Their "forward deployed engineer" grunt work consultants are the glue that binds the patchwork of shit code called the Palantir platform together.  Wake up!

What do they call the Big Mac?
Two things that amaze me about myself are: 

a) how quickly I become desensitized to money gained and lost

b) how poorly my emotions map to the change in amount

Losing 1k vs 10k doesn't even feel like a fuck ton difference even though that loss would represent a big chunk of my portfolio. We are weird.
Down to 40% of portfolio, had to cash out a bunch.

If you can manage "The Subtle Art of Not Giving A %@#! while PLTR slowly and painfully sinks", then you can practically do anything.
That doesn't even make sense as an argument. "This company said they'd do something unbelievably hard and did it, why did the value actually go up during that time?"
neither really
The software company that I work for reminds me of palantir. 20 years ago, my company began as a supplier information management platform that broke down data silos (erp, procurement systems, sourcing) to give the user a complete supplier profile. Our building partners were huge (GE, Sysco) because they had so many different systems across business units, they had no clear picture of what their suppliers did for them. Our platform integrates with all those systems to give a complete supplier profile. 

I’m all In on palantir. Integration platforms with workflow capabilities are worth their weight in gold and are really hard to develop. The fact that palantir’s developers can already integrate their software with the biggest organizations in the word already is very impressive and will lead to deals that are huge. 

They’ll probably be able to build out other applications on top of their existing platform soon and make even more money
Okay cool. They can do that. Just like I would never use a Huawei phone over an iphone/galaxy, I will never drive a NIO over a TSLA car. China makes cheaper products but the real winners are industry leaders. Tesla is a  industry leader.
Why would that be the last one? People are being careless more now than ever.

I would love to make more than 50k but I get 4 months off a year with 2 weeks of PTO and I enjoy what I do every day, so I place a lot of value on that when I don’t have any financial issues in current situation. Looks like I won’t be able to make more moving where we want to move so 40k for me is the minimum number we agreed on to get ourselves there then I can shop around for more. Working in education for 10 years doesn’t get you a ton of high earning prospects if you refuse to sell insurance. You’re acting like I haven’t put any thought at all into it, lol.
Why'd you buy a whole range of values? Instead of, say, all of it in 675P.
I'll sell the real close ones before it expires I'm thinking Monday will be green so I'll make a couple bucks on that and the little later calls I'll keep I have hope for those
Just look at M2 money supply curve and tell me if the money supply hasnt increased.

Money velocity is the problem, that is why inflation does not pick up, because QE money goes into financial assets (13 trillion of debt with negative interest rates?).

Stocks rise not on the illusion of money printing but on the fact that Fed will buy corporate debt, even junk bonds (you can see the historical purchases) thus removing default risk and perpetuating an ultralow interest risk environment.

If rates are zero and you value stocks using DCF method, what should be the premium for a zero interest rate and zero default rate?

Therefore stocks rise because of TINA (there is no alternative)

No. You just need the price of your option to go up. 

Options are a bet that price will go in your predicted direction, and quickly (in this case). If you wanted, you could exercise the option and buy 100 shares of tesla for each option. But we're really just buying the option, waiting for the option's price to go up, then selling. Like hot potato or musical chairs.

Trump is the current president and he lost the Jewish vote 70-30. The republicans haven’t won the Jewish vote in living memory, yet they held the presidency 20 out of 24 years at one point, from 1968-1992. They seem pretty bad at controlling the political system too.

I worked there several years ago. It’s a consulting firm masquerading as a product firm. Their product needs an army of consultants to both get running, and keep running behind the scenes and keep it working. Hence it not being scalable. Every tech firm wants to be perceived as a product company not a consulting company as it’s easier to scale. I’d look at a firm like Palo Alto instead which is in the opposite position, everyone thinks they’re a hardware company but they’re pivoting away from that and not yet priced in. 

Palantir is mostly hype, and a hell of a lot of employees drinking the kool aid and thinking they are ‘saving the shire’.

I don’t know anything, I’m just another disgusting RH millenial who is a total retard, so my opinion is unimportant. But I think RH democratized and opened the stock market up to a huge number of regular people. Their funds and participation is changing the narrative and outlook of the market and transforming what it’s “supposed” to be into what it is now. 

I’m probably totally overstating the weight that the millenial/Genz carry in the market. But it just seems to trend that way.

When stock market corrections happen, it’s not the only thing happening in isolation. Debt/money markets usually get spooked in conjunction too, which is where the fed always steps in to support these days. So it’s not that the fed is necessarily going to step in to explicitly prop up the stock market, but that the fed does step in and take action when the stock market falls because it’s happening alongside other trigger events that cause the fed to act. Which by extension keeps the stock market propped up indirectly.

Frankie my man, trust me. Nobody wants stocks worth a penny.  Cat food is a sure thing.  Literally cannot go tits up.

Chawlie, I told you we’re buying up these loser penny stocks. Then we’re dressing Dee up like a whore and sending her to Guigino’s to pretend like she’s a clueless heiress to some bigwig’s company.  She finds some rich gullible rube, sleeps with him, and convinces him the stock is undervalued.

I feel the same way.. Personally, I just bought two lots for build-to-rent. One near a college and a hospital. The other in a bit of a resort type place..that one i might build to sell..

  


Thoughts on metal framed housing? I've been looking at building a duplex near the hospital/college. Seems simple enough. What are your thoughts? Lumber prices make me want to jump off a cliff, but steel means I can make this property into a 6 unit building. I can also specialize in short-term leases. Finding a good GC is sucking the soul out of me tbh.

  


What are your thoughts? Btw, sorry about the bankruptcy. My family was in construction as well. We lost everything in 2009. My grandfather's company went under (and his connections with him).

>The fed cannot directly lend to households or employers.

I never said this at any point assface, I literally quoted Jerome Powell.

>Can you explain how QE is money printing?

Sure. Fed prints dollars out of thin air and uses it to buy treasuries (and sometimes other instruments) on the open market.

> The actual functioning of the Fed tends to be the complete opposite of what is said, or what is talked about in financial media.  Their entire goal is to create inflation expectation, which will likely result in inflation.  They can't create inflation directly because they can't actually print money.  Bank reserves are not money.

I’m not arguing we’re going to see inflation as a direct result of what the fed is doing. I’m arguing their actions will prevent another stock market collapse like 1929, and can prop up elevated stock prices.

yes. i agree with you there, ZIRP will keep markets high. and the continued increasing of the balance sheet will keep markets high.

im just saying they dont JUST print to pump the stock market, its definitely a goal and theres a reason to do so, but they print for tons of other reasons. you're not ignorant, its just that i totally disagree that they would try to stop a healthy correction in the markets.

A 17 year old cloud data company with virtually no overhead that hasn't made a profit in all 17 years that has over 1.47 billion shares outstanding is a solid investment. Got it.

Ok, looking forward to it. Thanks for putting in all the work.
I hold shares for now at an avg $29. Calls if it drops below $67ish this week.

I like SGMO as an alternative to the entire CRISPR play as well as BEAM. PACB and ILMN are a bit less risky but support the space.

For those not sure, EDIT > CRSP.
Why why why
You need to educate yourself a bit.  The fed cannot directly lend to households or employers.  That is fiscal policy, which is exclusively controlled by the government.   The fed only influences monetary policy.  Can you explain how QE is money printing?

The actual functioning of the Fed tends to be the complete opposite of what is said, or what is talked about in financial media.  Their entire goal is to create inflation expectation, which will likely result in inflation.  They can't create inflation directly because they can't actually print money.  Bank reserves are not money.

Of course there are better investments than gold over the long term, but you understand why you would hold it rather than cash or bonds if you expect inflation. Plus if you are expecting a stock market correction on top of the inflation then gold is a solid asset class
Fuck man how do you guys do it? I can't spend more than 10 minutes doing DD. Like I want to be a good trader but betting it all on black is so much more relaxing than digging through documents and analyzing trends.

 I know the majority of you just dump it all on a hunch, "DD is for r/investing you homo", but how do I dump it all on the right hunch?
C U @Bart station homie
Always fun to see the people on the other side who are keeping r/thetagang well fed.
I really don’t know. If you look at graph trends on TSLA, aside from market crash, TSLA rarely has “big” dips. There’s like 2 or 3 in their history. We’re living in a time where technology is advancing so rapidly and companies/people that innovate are the biggest deals. I’m sure it’s very possible for another big dip, but I wouldn’t count on it. Who knows how long that could take. I’d get in at the next small dip. For all we know, the next big dip is so much later than it ends up being higher priced than the current price lol.

And for your second question, idk. Do your own research and make your best judgment. If you’re just seeking opinions to tally them up or something. I strongly believe they will continue to make runs for years. TSLA and Elon are one of kind.

They have by eliminating a forced liquidation event by financial institutions and giving retards the illusion of money printing and inflation expectation.  People are running into stocks because of the  the idea that the USD is going to crash and hyperinflation is coming.  That entire premise is objectively absurd.
Mods didn’t want us in until we can take their bags 🤷‍♂️
I appreciate your response because I’m trying to explore this thought. It’s mostly just a thought experiment I want to think about. Your gold is still worth $1k in real terms. The gold itself hasn’t gained any real value. Which, I think is the point in gold investment, a hedge against disaster. However outside of gold and outside of cash, are there equities that are gaining real value even in the head winds of inflation? In other words, even if you’re worried about inflation, are there better investments

There is over $300m worth of shares that need to be bought back through the accelerated share repurchase by the end of Febp. It’s a very small float with the majority of it being shorted.

I’m buying calls to at least get me through the next quarter earnings in case things go sideways

You overestimate that like all of them do, yes they are closing stores you forget that those stores were allowed to bleed money for years, yes they are saving some money from that but now will have to spend said money on redesign for the website, people to manage website, customer service for said website, maintenance, and I imagine it will need advertising to let people know they aren't dead since they do a nice job of saying "we are closing" while not pointing them to the website whatsoever, all that money they save will not just sit around and suddenly save them, they got a very uphill battle to get into an already over saturated market that they will not be a major force in.

In the last 10 years your team has as many seasons with a winning record as we have seasons playing for a National Championship.  You have as many sub 5-win seasons as we have BCS/NY6 berths. "Dogshit team" lol.  I guess it's pretty cold in our shadow.

no they wouldn't.

the fed absolutely would not do that.

absolutely not, no you're a moron if you think that.

like, no. absolutely, no.... just no bro

the fed did not change their course of action in early September just because we corrected 10%.

you also show your ignorance, ok so the balance sheet is growing? but by how much? its absolutely not growing on the same pace as it did in march-june.

**the fed did its job, if you have read the most recent beige book report you would know this.**

again, the you show your ignorance, the Fed acts when the economy recedes 10%, not when the stock market recedes 10%

lmfao
You’re utterly clueless if you don’t think the fed’s actions have had an impact on the stock market
Cheers my guy Chimpu 😢🍻
Sounds shady af lol
What about options?
The other one's in there, it just gets sucked up into the scrote sometimes
Hyln makes sense though... They dont have a product... Im bullish but HYLN knows the stock doesn't have a chance until 2023... They even put it in their S1 fileing that they don't expect the stock to perform well. 

I know some people are bag holding right now and I hate it for them, but I am personally happy the price is down. I'm not a wealthy personn so the price depression means i have a chance to accumulate a lot of shares in smaller lots over the next two years before it takes off. 

This is a long term investment that requires a 3 to 5 year horizon. 💎👋 Will win in the end, but you have to be ready to see a lot of📉 days.

No, the repo operations were different and have been going on since 2019. It was to make sure the market didn’t collapse. And it directly enabled corporations to continue getting money from the debt markets. Which indirectly pumped up the stock market.

The reason China wanted to build their own FANG is so they can filter and control the content that chinese consume and prevent social unrest through social media. TSLA has no business in social media or content distribution. If they plan to replace it with NIO, they wouldn't let TSLA build a factory in China in the first place.

Look at the stock market... that is where the money is going. Pumping up asset prices. That’s why we’re not seeing inflation. 

And it’s not just QE. QE was weak compared to what the fed has been doing the last year

Yes absolutely. Based on the information I have from TSLA and Elon announcements, TSLA is going to be more innovating this year than last. So in my opinion, the FOMO only gets bigger, and TSLA will grow faster than last year. Get too big and they’ll want to split again. This is going to be the big year for FSD, and that subject alone I truly believe significantly boosts TSLA.

Long-term capital gains are taxed using a different set of income brackets vs your ordinary income. You can view those here: [https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/capital-gains-tax/601636/2021-capital-gains-tax-rate-thresholds](https://www.kiplinger.com/taxes/capital-gains-tax/601636/2021-capital-gains-tax-rate-thresholds)

But there are exceptions for certain types of capital gains, for which a flat rate applies (regardless of income level, like collectibles): [https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409](https://www.irs.gov/taxtopics/tc409)

(Note that I have also read that if your ordinary income bracket is lower than the 28% then you get to tax it as ordinary income, although I haven't looked up the regs to confirm this. So if your ordinary income marginal rate is 22% then you could count it as ordinary income at the 22 rate instead of 28.)

The separate 3.8% NIIT tax \*does\* depend on your income, but that applies to all types of capital gains. So if you're subject to NIIT then you could be looking at something as high as 31.8% tax on long-term gold gains.

>printing off a historical amount of money.

They can't get inflation above 2% because QE is NOT money printing.   The Fed cannot print money. Full stop. QE is a measure to keep interest rates low, increase bank reserves, and ***encourage*** banks to lend. If banks aren't lending more, no new money is getting created. Spoiler alert: the banks aren't lending more. If QE was money printing, we'd have inflation.  QE does not create money, it creates bank reserves. Bank reserves are not money.

They actually started pumping it in Sept 2019  , if you look at s&p 500 for reference, while giving it about a 15 % boost before letting it drop 30% . From the 30% it was fed millions to billions a week to where the last time we were able to actually calculate the amount they fed was about 9 trillion dollars . At that point they stopped reporting on thier quarterly releases how much they had been loaning into the junk bonds at low % intrest. But that was 5 months ago so we can only assume it has doubled the number recently estimated.  They also announced they dont plan on stopping .


Also take note if they didnt rise it the 15 to crash it 30% we would only really have seen around a 7% gain this year

I liked Moderna, big fan, really wanted them to be successful and they were. Their vaccine will save millions of lives, huge win, awesome!  **BUT** there is another company that promises not to profit from their vaccine during the pandemic, will literally produce it at cost and is ready to deliver. They have many millions of doses ready to go, and the UK (who were first to approve Pfizer and then Moderna) has now granted them approval.  Essentially the same product, you may want to research Oxford–AstraZeneca. If one company gives their product away at cost that might impact the revenue opportunities of other companies with the same product.

Negative interest rates would result in a massive deflationary spiral that would crush our economy worse than it is now.  Look up the Fisher equation.  If nominal interest rates go negative, then real rates need to increase which results in a negative rate of inflation (deflation).

They literally didn't though.  They did not buy new corporate bonds. They bought already existing corporate bonds from the debt holders as a measure to increase liquidity in the financial economy.  Companies did not issue new debt that the fed purchased.  There was not "free infinite money"

Yeah, but it’s still unsold to an actual buyer. If you’re good with that model, then looking at the produced numbers would be all you needed because that more closely aligned with the legacy auto companies
> Most GS locations I've been to are too small to really support people collecting and playing games there.

That's why they could make foot traffic explode by guaranteed stocking of this month's specials.  Tons of competition in the "big old dusty store disorganized but stocks most stuff most of the time" and tons online selling everything ever made cheaper but it takes awhile.  There's a spot in between.  An empty and profitable spot.

I don't think the spot in between is big enough or profitable enough for video games, just like little Radio Shack went out of business when digikey.com and amazon.com and best buy hit.  But I think that spot is big enough for "The Single Guy's Fun Friday Night Store"

For example, guarantee in nationwide advertising that every store in the entire country stocks at least one bottle of every color of W40K paint ready to pick up or they'll have amazon deliver it to your home completely free in two days, and they could be the convenience store for a certain male demographic.  Then surround the paint with impulse buy traps like energy drinks and five cent brushes marked up to five dollars.  Don't have to stock every mini kit ever made or every competitor to W40K ever made or every expansion book, just stock enough to be convenient.  Kinda like my local convenience store stocks like 400 brands of beer but does not stock every item the grocery store has.

They could make a shitload of money with decentralized fresh young management but we all know corporate is going to be corporate as heck and make it grandma's idea of the safest possible path, which will crash and burn.  But it could be a ten billion dollar franchise.

I extend my original remarks of three paths to a forth, go big or go home, GS should push hard to be the first nationwide chain that fully supports legalized weed.  I guess in backwards states they'll just have other product but in legal states their 4th pillar of "single guy's friday night alone party store" will have weed.

Just cuz some corporate big wig is on board, like daddy Cohen, doesn't mean GME will be successful in rebooting itself. Look at what happened to that new streaming service that just went tits up. It was run by that Pixar big shot and meg Whitman, ho from ebay. People r flaming it big time and totally shit the bed.

Rylan Cohen wants gme to 'adopt same world class infrastructure as 'chewy.' Seriously. Wtf does an online pet products.platform have to do with gaming. Gaming is cutting edge digital...and the companies at the edge are valve, epic, msoft and Sony. Along with content producers like Activision. Ryan Cohen is like a guy with a 2 inch flaccid pee pee at an orgy with hot busty babes getting drilled by 9.inch swole cocks.  And he is such a delusional douche he wonders why isn't getting any. 'You ain't getting any cuz you ain't got any.'

But QE isn't money printing and banks are lending less...
Bloods vs. Cryps
If you’re tested, I roughly consider the % of early assignment as intrinsic divided by premium so of my trades open, I have a short PLTR 24p 1/22 trading at 2.35 mark with close of 23.7. So 0.3/2.35 x 100% = 12.7%. Still really unlikely of early assignment so now I should do one of three things:

1) If I believe PLTR going back up next week, which I do currently because it’s hitting 30d support then I do nothing and wait the trade out

2) If I believe PLTR is starting flat around then I’ll sell to open a call, whether that’s at the same strike price 24c for a straddle or maybe a wider strangle idk yet, would see how Monday opens

3) If I expect to go down, just close the trade for a loss and not worry since the position size was small anyways (2% of total capital). My current STOP condition is 100% of the credit received. Currently today I’m 91% down on the individual play so almost there. Then would consider reopening (or rolling down and out)

You can also defend naked positions by turning it into a risk defined spread, depending on your preferences but i prefer to leave it naked

So you would have to always compare gold price against the change in CPI

They really try to push their mutual funds on you. It’s good for what it is but I think it’s predatory advertising a women’s fund for the entire year on the feed while charging clueless people 2% in expenses.

With Schwab, I just have everything connected and they compliment each other well without advertisements.

Russia has establish a reputation for an indifferent fearful cynical and therefore obedient populace, lying, and killing.

I loath job hunting, it's the worst, my ego is too big to allow myself to get negotiated on and judged like that. I was always a boss fighter. My advice is keep your head down, be like furniture. Get there early, leave late, don't bitch about your personal shit, just be there so much that you become reliable and outlast a wave or two of turnover. I could give a shit less if your the smartest or most talented person in the world, I want somebody whose reliable that I can depend on. Somebody who can effortlessly deal with my customers and just naturally know what needs to be done without being told. 

I fucking hate it when I hire somebody who takes that too extreme though, and doesn't ask questions. I caught a few people just sitting and staring because they didn't know something. No. Learn it. Ask me, I'll teach you. Keep asking until you fucking learn it, because I'm not paying you to fucking sit and pretend.

I just got hard
yea... just because we are doveish doesn't mean we will keep pumping

we already pumped from the lows, we could correct 15% right now and fed would do nothing.

in fact, a 15% correction or like 5-10% would seem VERY healthy right now.
Before what exactly? Before Trump signed law that foreign companies must adhere to certain guidelines (which BABA does) or before the CCP announced their investigation into monopolistic companies such as (BABA) to which they only got fined 75k?
Finally, MTCH doesn't get enough attention. 

There will literally always be horny, desperate guys who will pay to have a chance at getting girls. A company literally manages to commodify sex/romance while remaining socially acceptable to use and talk about and people worry about the longevity of their product? Also, the pandemic has only further increased exposure of new users to these apps (in which MTCH has almost no competitors).

I really like MTCH long term, and their leadership is well aware of the image each app has to the public (like tinder being mainly for hookups), and for a while they've been aiming to make sure their apps capture a specific share of the sex/romance market in a way that doesn't render other apps redundant. Just look at Hinge's revenue. 

Large portion of my portfolio is in MTCH shares, been waiting for any drop to buy leaps.
Zipcar has been trying to make it work, so far not so good
Do you know who Joe Manchin is? They don't have the votes to abolish the filibuster.  And Harry Reid changed the rules first.  McConnell just took it a step further.  Republicans didn't start it.
Peeps elsewhere have been making analysis based on the old rules, saying "this can't keep going up" or "This stock is overvalued and will correct". They just won't give up. The old rules don't apply right now.

I'm confident that they might again some day, but you have to ask yourself what the smartest play is. Do you keep trying to go against the trend, praying that the market suddenly does a 180 on this shit? Or do you go with the trend until there's an actual signal that things have fundamentally changed?

Nah, that didn’t work out well in Europe. Negative interest rates help to repay debt as you are literally defaulting on it (repaying less than what somebody lent you), but it triggers a negative feedback loop, “if rates are negative and I not only cannot earn interest on my bank account, but pay for it, I have to save more and spend less.” Just look at consumption in Europe, it has not improved at all. 

Way better to print and send money to people as Trump did, as that goes direct into consumption...or yoloing

You would just be selling the premium on the contract then. Say you buy calls atm (at the current stock price) then Apple jumps up 5% they gain value then you can sell the contracts to the highest bidder. In the money is safest and most expensive, at the money is safe as long as you suspect the price to go up a decent amount, and out of the money you are either buying a lot of time on your contracts like few months out or longer and you pray the price goes up to your strike or higher or get lucky on YOLO plays. For what this post is trying to say, safe is buying atm for February 2/19 calls or itm January 1/15 calls or as much time as you want to buy. take every post good dd or not with a grain of salt make your own decisions and manage your risk the way that is good for you. Just remember time in the market is better than timing the market.

I give Sherman a lot of shit, but the man has made some solid moves to get us where we are today even if he doesn’t seem to be moving with the urgency we’d all prefer.  But all his incentives are to keep his foot on the gas while shaking off this insanely high short interest. I just want to see him make an actual move to try to save his job here. The special dividend play would be legendary.  Thanks again for the good post.

I bet he's just being honest, he's not the kind of guy who'll go and grovel for a government. He'd probably be so bad at it governments are not even going to try. People always want to make things simple so they can feel better about hating things. The CCP can both keep Uighurs in concentration camps, kill journalists and dissidents willinilly and still care about the benefit of their people. In fact they probably do it because they care about the welfare of the people. Just not those people who don't play along.

You can go to China and live a happy good life. Just don't talk shit about the government or engage in anti social behaviour, such as worshipping unsanctioned deities. Not my cup of tea, but I don't blame a Chinese person if the alternative is going hungry.

I'm low on patience. I keep thinking I could do all this shit myself and save money but I want my time more then my money.

Exactly, I was a 🌈🐻 as I thought it was impossible for the Fed to levitate this market with its money printer. Boy was I wrong... 1929 has nothing to do with this when it comes to monetary policy, in fact it is the complete opposite one. All previous crisis including that of 1970s were preceded by tightening monetary policy or rising interest rates.

Fed can not stop printing or assets and consumption will collapse, and cannot raise interest rates or pension funds will go bust. It is literally a “no way out” for them. The only way is to keep printing and generate stagflation that will lead to a soft default in which new dollars at zero interest rates will pay all previous debt and dollar will keep losing value. Literally a ponzi scheme, but it is legal as the government and the fed are the ones perpetrating it.
Back in my day no one here bought any stocks at all. It was 100% options. You can tell our retardation is being diluted with all the noobs.

BABA is too risky. Who knows exactly what's gonna happen, but what we can count on is that SOMETHING is going to happen. The investigation isn't going to destroy BABA, but it also isn't going to come out as nothing either. Xi is punishing Ma through BABA. "He's not the CEO.....Hes just a shareholder..." Fuck off. Your factually correct but, "come on man." 


Im thinking at the very least, BABA gets a fine and dick slapping over forced exclusivity they have been using with some of the larger retailers. Which then means those retailers can go to the other 2 major platforms Pinduoduo or JD com. I like JD just because they are focusing on growing their e commerce at the perfect time, and they also have a lot of value in how much of their workforce is robotic. From warehouse to drone delivery, it's kinda fucking cool. Also, their drones allow them to serve more rural areas in China at a much faster pace than currently offered. Need farming equipment/tools? Milk for dinner? Daddy JD be there in an hour via drone. 

TL;DR BABA gets dick slapped for exclusivity and JD or Pinduoduo moons. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Greater minds than mine would probably answer that question better. But I think that GME = Blockbuster is a more prevailing sentiment than you’d think if you’re just on the WSB boards here. That and many short institutions are in too deep and can’t exit easily. If the sentiment expressed here on WSB becomes more mainstream, though (and I think it’s just a matter of time before events will force that reckoning) then things could get wild.

Sure on average but this was an exceptionally bullish year.  What you're seeing is a snapshot.  None of these guys can replicate that over 10 years.  But if you're not trying to take some risks in a market like this you're going to lose potential gains.
Cuz there are almost 2 million subbed here plus who knows how many lurkers. Only the truest of autists have the nuts to post loss porn. The majority of people are probably close to flat one way or the other. The next group of people probably have mostly losses, then a smaller group with moderate gains, and finally a minority with 1000%+ gain porn
And I'm still an order of magnitude smarter than you guys.

China is important for becoming big, once they achieve total domination, they can afford losing some market share to chinese crap, they will still keep the high margin business. So its a win win in a way. They fuck each other in different holes you could say.

Their sales have been declining in China actually, but yeah they’re still big. Huawei is obviously nowhere near as good but it’s the closest Chinese company that’s actually been successful taking market share away from Apple. Not saying it can’t happen but I think people need to consider the possibility that at some point the China US shit will motivate the CCP to really crack down on any big American businesses over there.
which theoretical perfect play was that
[removed]
i smell at least 2 bans here
Yup! Just depends how you want to play it.

With debit spreads you need the underlying to move in your direction, with credit spreads you just need the underlying not to move against you (flat is ok). Reduced risk = reduced profit.

It also depends on how wide your spread is and the volatility involved.
lol i own shares on all this already

[removed]
Depends on the stock. .2 delta for a non-volatile stock could only imply 3-4% movement over 60 days. For a stock like TSLA or FUBO, .2 delta would require a 40% movement.

.4 delta is usually the middle ground to play it a bit safer but not pay too much when you go for 30-60 day options. Otherwise, you’re basically just earning the movement of the underlying if you choose a .7-.8 delta.

There’s so many reasons to be bullish. Wtf? Lol Ryan Cohen who built Chewy as the one stop shop for Pets as someone who is backing and pushing for a revamp of the company is huge. Right now GME has a metric fuck ton of power up subscribers. Changing the app and working on direct distribution to customers is huge. 

They made a deal where they get a percentage of online sales from consoles that they sold directly. Where do you think people buy consoles? GME.  Look at their all time chart and review console release dates and their stock price. Think about all the pent up demand for consoles. Apple ripped most of the tech that came through this year from the already strangled supply chains. We haven’t even seen numbers but the consoles are likely to remain sold out for awhile with increasing demand. 

Short squeeze?

There’s so much more to it. Just search GME in the sub

Yup no info yet on price....will probably be priced similar to a7 or rs7...should get announced on Nio Day, though they have an entry level sedan in the works apparently. Tesla def has everyone beat on price bo doubt about that...their #1 assets are and will be vertical integration, manufacturing, and now even global supply chain management.  Their tech ain't bad either 😎 Tough to beat.

Not as exciting as a pure long call into a huge move but I like how you can control your cost and your exposure. Plus if you get a directional move right and move from OTM to ITM, you can just hold until expiry and get paid from theta.

Plus most of the time for me, my percentage returns on debit spreads are fairly similar to percentage returns on the long calls so you get very similar upside for a lot less risk.

I was up a couple hundred bucks on PRPL on the vertical spreads I sold (my first trade) and thought to myself "I can make a couple hundred more if I hold through earnings." Suffice to say PRPL taught me to never, ever hold through earnings or other binary events. And for that I'll be forever grateful.

Yeah with you on selling the puts for sure. I haven’t dug incredibly deep into the merits of credit spreads. I just know I’m more insulated from weird shit happening at expiry with debit spreads. Seen a bunch of horror stories about getting assigned after the long call expires worthless then all of a sudden you’ve got 100 x #spreads shares of exposure over night or over a weekend. Most of the time it’s just a short term theta play for me and I don’t really want to get deeper into my long position
[deleted]
I’m not sure where your numbers are coming from. Nio projected something like 16-17k for the quarter. Adding up all months’ deliveries, they would need to beat around 6100 deliveries in December to meet it. I know I’m a little off, but even so that’s a bit of a stretch looking at October and November. Still balls deep in $50 calls for April tho. They’ve delivered somewhere around 36-40k cars this year.

Call prices are up since it’s had a couple of green days, but not too much. There’s still room to go. I’m up 60% on 1/15 $51.50’s I bought on Monday.

Alternatively, tell them you have autism and cps will give you a new dad with another 23k to stay safely in your GME portfolios.
I don't think you're wrong, but there other sub-reddits for your kind of rational logic-tardedness.
And you'll probably find the same people but the opposite comments.
The Melvin bear thesis inherently contains piracy because the ability to digitally own games and the sales that companies are making in order to expand (and to some extent combat) the reality that all the information is free is what caused the original downfall of the physical media industry. 

The thesis itself is going to be an accumulation, not a singular stance, of the reality in play. It's like the console cycle thesis where ultimately we know that the sales of large bundles at really high prices raises revenues but also that there will be a large set of games sold and traded and that activity during this time will rise. 

Unfortunately the bear thesis in this case naturally outlives (timeline) the bull thesis, right? The spike in revenues will end but the actual problem of the competitiveness of game creation, from indie gaming becoming large with large publishers losing market share and effectively market power, to the fact that you can circumvent buying which means that the only way to consolidate revenues is to literally own the game to the point of owning the servers and being unable to play outside those servers (think Riot Games and League of Legends or Epic Games and Fortnite) leads to an end to the brick and mortar swap shop concept. 

I assume at some point we will figure out a way to achieve digital key swapping with legal ownership intact so people can trade digital games. If that happens it's pretty much over for B&M and unless GME is the pioneer of this technology it'll have an even tougher time staying relevant. I get the whole nostalgia argument but I don't think that's enough to keep the business afloat as it stands.
fuck do I all in GME or PLTR calls

You know, a single word “Protectionism” is not a binary policy. It’s not either on or off. 

Most countries in the world are open to trade. Each place, however, has its own policy. 

The point, it all depends on the details. It’s safe to say we’ve have had a very open policy and lost a ton jobs due to it. Maybe there is middle ground.

You can kinda see what the delta is to gauge how “printy” it’ll be, I bought a very tight spread on NVDA once and got like $100 even though I nailed the bottom. Sometimes it do be like that if you buy the strikes wrong

Man, that was a good article. My take-away from it is that the Chinese have been very smart with how they gain tech and infrastructure. Conversely, sounds like Western companies and gov'ts have been very weak in preventing China from acquiring said tech and infrastructure.   
I understand if people want to criticize the methods of Trump's "trade war with China", but ultimately, I appreciate the principle of "let's do SOMETHING rather than nothing" to prevent/ slow the rise of China as the world's dominant economic power and make sure wealth can be transferred back to North America.

It’s like selling a put and selling a covered call is basically the same except you generally get more for puts and your cost basis will be lowered if you  get assigned the stock.   


idk why anyone would buy 100 shares instead of selling a put first
No trust in XLE CEO rn
Shit the pandemic was bullish for tesla. Pretty sure it helped them sell more
The thing with both the e-tron and the i-pace is that they give 357km and 377km respectively to Model 3's 423km while costing CAD$40,000 more. Even if you get the long range Model 3, you have 507km range and still CAD$15000 cheaper. From a utilitarian perspective, Tesla wins by a margin. And if battery day is to be believed, that margin will get bigger.

I would wager making an interior of a car nicer or quality control will be much easier for Tesla than making better and more efficient batteries for everybody else. And if that all evens out, they'll still need to be able to take the price down.

Yeah customer service. I posted some of my complaints in another post here.

The delivery date wasn’t good for me. I tried to reschedule but was never able to reach anyone. Tried to email as well, no response. Ended up having to go that day because what else was I gonna do?

I also tried to sign up for the two week insurance through them - never got a call back 

Service at the pick up wasnt great too. It was basically just an assembly line of cars and people. Somebody just told me my car was in a spot and see ya later. Nobody walked me to my car or told me anything about how the car works, what to do etc (this is my first Tesla, would have been nice to get some reassurance and support)

My friend got one too had some of the same issues trying to reach them. Fortunately our cars were in good shape. Still not the best first experience and hope that if I do need service on the car that we can expect better communication in the future

We can call him a great engineer because he is involved in design of all of the tesla, spacex stuffs (there are UX/UI engineer) like that he is a product design and development engineer, products developed by tesla and spacex speak for themselves.

So by your rationale, Larry Ellison does not code now a days so he is not an engineer any more?

Wait piracy is now a part of the Melvin/bear thesis? What is this 1999 downloading movies off of The Pirate Bay?
like your sizing.. if i stick my head out that is a good rule of thumb.. how do you deal with assignment risk and one of your written options going ITM?  Are you able to protect and naked put by holding a long call or how do you mitigate some of that risk?  Also, do you hold the common stock at a fairly reasonable cost you are willing to part with shares if needed (i.e. if call exercised) or do you plan to put up the capital at exercise?  Don't mean to come across like interview questions but genuinely curious.. appreciate it if you do get back to me!

No one was going to pay money for this trash
Debit spreads are by far my favorite kind of play rn. Get returns like a long call without the constant need for the stock to go up. If your ITM you just get paid with time too
Debit spreads are stupid. You’re basically capping your profit and need the stock to go up. Just do a credit spread and you don’t need the stock to actually go up. 

Both of them you gotta wait almost till expiration to reap the full profit anyways and theta is working for you with credit spread

Been fucking around with it all weekend.
I lived in Seattle/Bellevue/Bellingham for about 10 years. The way that place has grown is insane. Based on what a lot of other people are saying in the comments, it seems like the trend is exodus from major cities and massive jumps in prices for smaller cities and distant suburbs. Like it always is, this seems to be a market to market thing, and not necessarily generalized to the whole country.

The interest rates are another argument that I think will likely keep the market inflated for another two years. So while I do think a real estate cycle is imminent, I also think we won't see it start to slide until 2023. Selling peak summer this year is still a fine time to exit in my opinion. I'm not trying to time the top, but rather I'm trying not to screw my self while selling my rental property. 

In my area, we didn't get the usual winter dip in prices, but rather home prices have stayed high and have kept going up. The concern I had was there was going to be a correction, and we wouldn't see a bump in prices this summer. Based on what others are saying about interest rates, etc, it seems like what I am seeing now is in fact the start of what will be an insane 18 month run in real estate. 

Also, I really like my current tenants. They are truly great people. While I am tired of being a land lord, I don't mind giving my current tenants plenty of time to find the perfect place to live. I imagine after eviction protections expire in a month, my tenants should be very satisfied with the rental options that hit the market this spring and early summer.

The old saying of "be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful" seems to apply here.
No no no!! This is TSLA we are talking about! They are “revolutionary”. Gonna be a game changer. Just trust me!! Nothing to worry about. Definitely isn’t overvalued or anything like that

Elon made a lot out of making their patents available for others to use (as he put it) “in good faith.”

But there’s no way TSLA would sacrifice its competitive advantage (or, at this point, risk a derivative action from shareholders) by making public its most sensitive IP, trade secrets, and knowhow.

Even going by Elon’s own open-source criteria, would the CCP be acting “in good faith” by forcibly appropriating TSLA’s IP through a JV with a Chinese EV company? No.
They don't like Jack Ma, but they like BABA infrastructure. This is from first hand experience. It is very easy for the CCP to separate MA from BABA and continue on. He's already out of the day to day of the company. He's a shareholder with a loud voice, in terms of control he has little.

Also I bought PLTR at 28 and it has never been above it.

No worries then bro. Just hold for a couple of months. You'll see what happens after lockup ends. I'm in for 658 shares (europoor here, rest is nicely diversified in SPACs and GME, as is tradition). Nice position you got, what's your cost basis?
I don’t know about their pro membership so I won’t speak on that and give you the benefit of the doubt. And same day delivery is a competitive advantage. I will agree with that as well. But also I believe they would lose this competitive advantage closing all their B&M stores, as that’s most likely how they’re achieving it. What I will argue is that game informer is not a competitive advantage. And it is something that can be obtained by never even going into a B&M store.

And to your point on Walmart, sure you may not go there. And that’s completely fine. But you have to understand how the average consumer acts and I’m sorry, you’re not the average consumer/Target audience. 

I will give you that GameStop seems they’re moving forward and making correct decisions, and the market is huge and they can control a larger portion of the market than they already do. But again, you can’t say they’re going to get rid of all of their B&M stores as that would be getting rid of their competitive advantage of having same day delivery. 

All in all I’m not doubting that GameStop can and have improved, it’s just I think a lot of what you have said has an extreme bias. Like I said, I have no stake, I’m not going to short GME as what they’re doing does seem great. But I’m also not willing to buy into it either.
And I thought I was the only one who felt this way....

>other car makers don't have shit. 

If Ford manages to sell their POS EV "mustang" at even 10% of Tesla's total yearly volume, TESLA should be concerned. 

Other car companies are coming out with their own EVs and starting to make their pivot to EV.

TESLA will have to be able to increase their production capacity by ~35 times their 2020 numbers to be able to be equal in production with US current car production. ~17.1 million units in total for 2019

TESLA has only increased their capacity by 65% in 2019 and only increased it by 25% this year.

Even at a 65% yearly growth held constant which is fucking insane it will still take them 8 years to reach Total US market take over.  TESLA will eventually hit a break point on people that are willing to buy a EV as they run out of fan boys and have to market to the general public and their shit quality control.

All the major car companies have also been installing and updating the infrastructure for charging for their cars as well.
It’s about tactics not IP.

I see your Q&A about PLTR but I still don’t think it is done yet.

And this is coming from a retard that was telling everyone to go in balls deep when it IPO’d and no one believed me.

I see it going back up 25% in the next 1-3 months.  Granted no wars start, domestic or abroad.

Pltr
It's classic cultist behavior. 5 months ago none of you even mentioned this company and now you're defending it like it were Helen of Troy. 

Let's do this (again) slowly.

>Show us some naked call sales then if you’re so confident. 

That makes no sense. Everyone here knows it is going to rise based on the console cycle. Why would I sell naked calls against an obvious event? Again, the fact that GME is not the future of gaming technology and suffers from piracy and lost relevance in the age of digital rights and easy mitigation has nothing to do with a bullish or bearish current outlook.

Brick dumb.

>One of the most successful millennial tech entrepreneurs, a billionaire that built in the pet vertical an almost identical eCommerce model for how GME is being envisioned, has bet hundreds of millions he can do it again.

Ryan Cohen built and sold a large business, true, he has done this once, not many times, and is not a serial entrepreneur. RC Ventures has a portfolio with about four other foreign companies in it and you have never heard of any of them. Truth be told neither have I. Times were different, this is a very different business, and there is a massive difference between running the business and being a major stakeholder so I won't pretend to know what will happen as it's been a whole 5 months and frankly not much has occurred materially.

>Collectively WSB has also put up easily ~$10mm+, much of which is already bigly green.

The stock has quintupled, yes. That makes sense with the console thesis. It has zero to do with this sub. The console releases would have likely elevated the price to this level with or without the interest of this sub and small retail investors because we know it drives revenues very well. It would have even without Cohen or whatever.

>Some of the largest asset managers (JPMAM, WFAM) and pods at major MM hedge funds (Millennium, P72) have anywhere from 2x-13x their long positions from Q2-Q3 2020 according to filings.

Which again makes sense with the console thesis and the large revenue spike. It's not even an "expected" spike, it's a known spike, so yeah. 

>Either all of these people are retarded (minus the WSBers because we know they are) or you’re just too bought into the bear thesis that’s been parroted for years to recognize when you’re wrong.

No. You see, you have lost track of something important: Time. Yeah, there will be a revenue spike. No one is arguing otherwise. GME will go up and has gone up 5 fold. No one is surprised. The question is *will it hold* and I have yet to see anyone say that they think GME will be here in 10 years. Not a single person, and I put the challenge out multiple times, has given a 10 year case.

Yes, there will be a spike in price. Yeah. We all got that. It's not esoteric and you're not brilliant for making a known play. DeepFuckingValue is brilliant because he saw it when it was $4. You at $16 are just riding an obvious conclusion.

>Stop being a 🌈🐻. Just buy shares and take the free money you autist.

Straddle. You buy the long calls and make the spike and then long puts and make the drop. I don't think it'll hold and honestly I have yet to have anyone tell me why GME will hold past the spike.

Stop being an idiot. Make money both ways.
No one here has for a second though we were going to call the exact date. I’m in it for the new cycle that we are beginning with XBOX/PS. Most of my shares (800 @ $18) are set to sell at a reasonable $50-75 range. The point is get in now before it potentially happens or you have faith in the cycle history. 

So - sure cut out the memes if that’s what you want - or go check out r/investing.

Don’t quit. But take time during the day to do some day trading for a mental break. Also if you search for another job while at work, use your phone and don’t use the company wifi. Turn it off on your phone. My company IT guys told me they check to see if employees are looking for jobs elsewhere. It’s a red flag. So if you do it, use your personal phone not on the company web access. Also wipe your your phone searches to be safe. If you’re this unhappy you’re probably going to leave. Don’t give them a reason to fire you. Good luck bro.

That's because many have far OTM calls for January bought mid November or later, I'm talking 35c and above, that are now down 90-99% and will never break even. I do too, and already made peace with the loss, but for someone who YOLOed into them it's not that easy! It's an emotional response, gotta wait till thosecalls expire worthless and for people to accept the loss and move on

Yes, the answer is yes.
You can't ban talk about a specific instrument because thats manipulating the investing habits of denizens. You could argue all posts are manipulative to some degree and it's an easy argument to make but then you'd have to ban all posts about everything if you were worried about that side of things.

It's interesting because this sub was so obsessed with Tesla for a good while and then people just stopped caring...and Tesla kept going up. With the meme stocks it's really hard to tell what's going on and when people will lose interest. I think GME is even more difficult to time because people (generally) hold shares and not options so there's a lot more diamond handing going on. Honestly it'll be hyped every time the price moves 5% (either way) until it either collapses or rockets. If that's annoying to you maybe stop frequenting this sub.

You will lose ... ur sanity
I'm gonna do that too. There's a pandemic and I got no friends, might as well make hundreds more a month
But we could make the rules of posting about gme more strict. Like, unless it's serious DD or news, then stfu. 

I've seen was too many idiots predicting the short squeez with specific dates by now, and all of them were wrong so far. Your usual toiletpaper hand fammot can only bear so many false dates before selling
It really comes down to what they say in this damn conference. I think if they have an ambitious view of the future even if it might be far fetched it would put GME on her radar (assuming it already isn't). My hope is they attempt to create a competitor for Twitch, that would immediately scare the FUCK out of any short holders
REC is the best, but the version on Amazon for rental is a terrible dub. Be My Cat is very well-acted, Hell House LLC is fun and spooky, and Bad Ben is hilarious and worth watching if you’re a fan of the genre. It is hard finding quality FF movies tho

Yeah, Cohen is our backstop here. And him buying at 16 should give us all a lot of comfort. But do not underestimate the folks on the other side of this trade. They are going to do everything they can to get out of this alive. Know you have a very large position, so you already have balls, but just remember that there ain’t no such thing as easy money. Patience and balls of steel here should be rewarded because GME is not going bankrupt and Cohen is coming for this thing.

They are the ones selling the calls and puts for small premiums, expecting that the market won't be as volatile. So they profit from theta decay, which basically means that the stock trades flat until the expiry date, making the option expire worthless.

Hi PDT  
I agree with your dip/crash theory. My husband was a real estate investor and agent for over 10 years back when the big crash happened and he got stuck with a few properties. Condos are the first to fall. He’s found 3 examples of condos that have had to be reduced below what they previously sold for less than a year ago and are still sitting on the market in downtown Seattle. A dip seems imminent.   
I won’t make any suggestions as I’m not sure which city your rental is in and of course we are all speculating here. My personal situation is I own land and want to build but also wanting to get an investment property so a crash could be helpful for that.  
Thank you for your post!

How predictable is the market. Had some decent red from selling at the end of the year. Is this always the case or does retail add to this. If I buy some puts say 3 weeks before taxes are due, they should print pretty easily right? Cant be this simple can it. Does all this retail in the market make it almost predictable?

"I didn't lose anything, I still have just as many shares “
Some Cliff Notes for those just joining the GME story, not familiar with the films, or have been living in a cave for the last few months:

* 0:06 Ryan Cohen activist shareholder volunteers from the crowd of investors.
* 0:20 #WeWantCohen is the hashtag on Twitter for people who want Ryan on the board.
* 0:24 Cohen takes 9% stake.
* 0:37 Cohen unfurls a 13% stake, keeping all the shareholders under his wing. Partly good business, partially seen as a way to mock CEO Sherman for trying to dilute his stake by threatening a shelf offering to just go buy more.
* 0:48 Redditor DeepF\*\*\*ingValue has a few million stake as a long time holder. He lately announced his alter ego as RoaringKitty on Twitter, hence the cat.
* 0:55 Dr. Supercuts, who doesn't wear shoes is a callback to 'The Big Short'. Dr. Burry is a stakeholder in GME. This video features his shoeless feet and a bad haircut.
* 1:00 Dark pool liquidity: There is suspicion of some dark pool capital changing hands for large short positions off-market to try to exit their wrong bet.
* 1:08 Ryan Cohen takes his critics to task on Twitter, with this weeks mocking 'Buyer beware' tweet next to a video of their criticism. Hence a 'Beware of this' as he slays an eyeless ghoul.
* 1:22 Melvin Capital is one of the large short positions against GME.
* 1:38 CEO Sherman announced a possible small share dilution which had whiffs of a poison pill to try to fend off activism. In the films, the villain Snow drinks a bit of poison from the same bottle to show its safety, so that people he gives a glass of poison drink their whole glass. This gives Snow bleeding from mouth sores caused by the poison.
* 1:41 Takeover plan: Ryan Cohen has spelled out a path to profitability, taken on the services of a takeover lawyer, said a board seat isn't good enough for him, and he will do whatever it takes to protect shareholder value.
* 1:50 By shooting a rocketship arrow through the artificial share price ceiling, the moon is revealed and price heads there.

One of the most successful millennial tech entrepreneurs, a billionaire that built in the pet vertical an almost identical eCommerce model for how GME is being envisioned, has bet hundreds of millions he can do it again. Collectively WSB has also put up easily ~$10mm+, much of which is already bigly green. Some of the largest asset managers (JPMAM, WFAM) and pods at major MM hedge funds (Millennium, P72) have anywhere from 2x-13x their long positions from Q2-Q3 2020 according to filings. Either all of these people are retarded (minus the WSBers because we know they are) or you’re just too bought into the bear thesis that’s been parroted for years to recognize when you’re wrong. Stop being a 🌈🐻. Just buy shares and take the free money you stubborn autist.

Will PLTR break 25 this week?
If it goes down just sell Covered calls close ITM and make sure that the break even point is just above 27.40

You may hold the shares for 1-2 weeks but you won’t lose money if done properly. 

If the stock continues to drop buy the CCs back for cheaper than you sold them and sell new ITM CCs 

CCs will help mitigate your risk and you can sell 3 of them. FUBOs IV is so high you get get nasty premiums

From his wiki below:
> By leveraging trades for significant amounts, he managed to turn $10–20 thousand into $12 million by 2000. Eventually, when the market crashed, Sacca found himself in debt with a four million dollar negative balance. He negotiated to have it reduced to $2.125 million

Personally got myself out of a shitty situation recently...  Thought it was a dream job scenario, but turned out to be a nightmare.  Sooo much happier now and learning to trust myself again.  Took the leap with the goal of not looking for work for an entire year...  got a new gig that doesn’t pay as much, but is completely flexible and is much better from a live/work perspective.  Opportunities are popping up everywhere now.  Good luck!  It isn’t as scary as you might imagine if you are at all inventive...
He placed a limit order for pre-market Monday morning
Because it hasn’t made the move we foresee it making. We’re certain it’s undervalued, we know it’s being manipulated, and we’re just entertaining ourselves until it begins its ascent.
But neither are realistic options for them, epic tried that and bled money for a while and they didnt overtake steam, and yes dev's might flock to it but that would mean they would need to have a pretty hefty chunk of money they are willing to throw away to devs hoping that in the meantime they can overtake steam which would take months if not years and I just dont think gme has that kind of money to waste, yes they closed stores but it was incredibly late those stores were bleeding money for years beforehand, and that is just touching one of its competitors not the lengthy list of others it has against it.

How will we know when the squeeze is over? Answer: when most of the shorts have covered. 

If the stock price is $100 BUT the short interest is still over 50%, DONT FKNG SELL THERES STILL A LONG ASS WAY TO GO

If the short interest has dropped to normal FAANG levels of 5-15%, then the squeeze is likely over or close to it. AKA only 5-10 million shares sold short.

I use tinder and dating apps myself. I found exponential more users in the past 3 months (I used to see same profile again and again, but no more - I find way more diversity in the group). I believe people are getting hungry for dating in this pandemic. If investors are aware of this case, I think there will be an upmove before next earnings. Not to mention 80% upside from last year is so low for MTCH. (How many new people around you joined dating app just this year?)

I also saw base line support that is moving MTCH at least 15%/month. 

I thought MTCH is cheap at 40B market cap when ABNB is almost 100B. But the last reason wasn’t part of my YOLO.

I’m just a pure retard who wants to join autist group.

Just curious, your link says that you're up 2m or 980% since July 2017 but you have a post in your history from six months ago that says you were up 200k or 2,978% since July 2017.

How do those percentages work? Did you add money to your account or something ( I don't use RH so idk how it works if you add money)

Every time your options expire worthless and out of the money, the person who sold them to you has made money. Theta gang makes money selling options to people who don’t know what they’re doing.
With interest rates staying so low, home prices won’t budge out here. Morgan Hill is starting to become somewhat to Los Gatos. Prices are just  ridiculous, I’ll just stick with Gilroy and have an affordable monthly payment.
If you’re doing it every month bc you’re a fat ass who can’t keep the weight off afterwards sure.
I specifically said how it used to be. 

Yes, the promo has changed. In fact, it changes all the time.
Those prices are fantastic!
I'm not arguing a potential drop; you can have a great quarter on the book but the price might drop. 

You just said that Tesla had shit numbers but also brought up how Apple can have a great quarter delivery wise and they drop. This implies that Tesla had a great quarter since in your Apple example the scenario is the same.

So which is it? Tesla had a good quarter or bad?

Probably insurance fraud but kewl story bro.
That’s not what I said. I said, nobody made a phone as good as the iPhone so for Apple to dominate the market (and market cap) as good as it has makes total sense. However, for Tesla that is just not the case and I gave you multiple examples of why that is. 

The base model price of the TAYCAN is very similarly priced to the model S. The Plaid model S is very similar to the Taycan Turbo. However, in  nearly every way... the Taycan is a better car. 

There would be no argument from me today if Tesla made by far the best car ever but that’s just not true. Most of the people I know with Model 3, S, and X regret it. The person who bought FSD hella regrets, the person who bought the X hella regrets it, the person who bought the P85D model S hella regrets it. The person who bought his model 3 almost died on the highway because his front bumper just flew off and he swerved at 100km/hour into the highway divider to avoid it. 

Will the stock go up? Maybe. But do these experiences sound like something that’s typical for a car company that’s more available then nearly every other car company combined?

Soooo I'm an RN in a hospital in NY on a covid unit (you're welcome, you're welcome, proud to to do my service)

and I fractured my nose on halloween surfing, piece of my nose was hanging off. Had to get 20 stitches at my ER.

Sooo I remembered I had this shit called "accident insurance", an employee benefit i signed up for, which covers accidents outside of work. It's like $50 for the year. I had a surfing "accident" so I filed a claim. Ended up getting 2 and a half grand for it. Open laceration itself paid out 2 grand.

Then  I get a check in the mail for 3 grand from my insurance company to pay my ER bill.

But I work at the hospital so I don't get billed for that shit. It's all free cause I'm an employee.

So breaking my nose was one of the best things to happen to me.
Embrace the meme and make some money
Yeah because *now*  is the time that the market will suddenly start to care about Tesla’s actual numbers.

Don’t get me wrong I agree with you in principle but a P/E of 1375 seems to make it pretty clear that the market doesn’t currently give two figs about principles.

The CCP has made it a goal to be a technological leader in the world and or at least become independent enough so it doesn't have to rely on the west from a technological standpoint. Destroying alibaba from within and whatnot would greatly hamper those goals for a ton of reasons, and for that reason I remain bullish on this company and see it as a rare opportunity to make a decent return. If anyone has any info to contradict me please do so.

I like how people exclaim that Tesla is not a car company, yet they lose their marbles when tesla sells around 500k vehicles in a year (I guess we aren't getting the 1 million robotaxis this year as Elon noted that were coming for sure back in 2019). 

If Tesla is in fact not a car company, than at this point Tesla vehicle sales really should not hold that much weight anymore to the movement of their stock price and valuation. If they missed it or hit it, who cares. Tesla's current valuation is not based whatsoever on being a car manufacturer anymore. Tesla will never be justified at 700 billion based solely on their vehicle sales (even if someday they sell more than Toyota's 10 mil/yr). 

The true justification at this point is in it's tech and the growth in their other areas. That is where you guys need to be focusing on if you are actually trying to analyze whether the company is a good invest for the future at its current stock price. 

But, this WSB, so $1690 1/8. They will be bigger than Amazon by the EOW!

[278.55%](https://imgur.com/a/VDQJUnY) Stocks only, no margin.

Sold ENPH at $40 before Feb earnings, went to $60 after earnings.

Went all in AAPL / MSFT in Feb 21 (hey, at last a dip..), just before the market crash. The following 3 months were a once in a lifetime experience.
I sold for profit in early June, while I was trapped, ENPH went to $22 and back to $70.

FOMOED into TSLA at $900 after it had multiple +10% days, the moment I bought it dropped like 100+ points in 30sec. Used a stop loss, back to $250 or $2000 was anyone's guess.

Started a position in ENPH at $56, Prescience Point came and I doubled down at $38.

This was my first full year in the stock market, started early 19. I learned so many things, had unique experiences, I even made some money :P

I think they are anticipating less than impressive holiday numbers and/or some letdown from the ICR conference and that they plan to FUD the fuck out of it here to kill any SP momentum.
I mean, there is no arguing our intelligence. We went from #6 in 1990 to #27 today in education ranking. I am not exactly sure the criteria of the ranking system, but that feels accurate to me. Nothing really going on indicates our education levels will rise anytime soon so get ready for full retard mode.

Also a shameless plug here, part of the problem is outside of WSBs we don't call retards retards anymore. Teaching to the bottom student in school ensures the smartest students learn nothing. We should be teaching up, and if the retards fall behind who cares?

GME is not becoming a weeb paradise. It's just not happening.

I do think your idea of moving into table top is sound theoretically, but has a lot of issues. Most notably is space. Most GS locations I've been to are too small to really support people collecting and playing games there. They would also need an astronomical bump in the Table Top Gaming/Card Collection Game scenes to support their business. If they partnered with WOTC they might actually be able to get something done, there. 

However, I've heard nothing to indicate that they would do, or even consider, something this outside of their current vertical. They are fucking DONE in the industry of video games. Until they communicate something that transitions them out of that market, their business will continue to death spiral.

You people are cultists.

How is, "GME is not the future of gaming technology" equivalent to the GME bear case? 

The bear case, as stated, is that GME suffers from piracy issues. If you can steal the games that you can buy used and no one cares why would you buy the game? The model that GME and almost every physical rights industry suffered as time went on was exactly that: Piracy.

>Christ...this is almost too retarded to respond to.

I thought that but realized that abandoning children to themselves was wrong.
The current valuation is not fine -- it is undervalued. And by a significant margin, too.

As Someone who worked at an electronic store, I think you would be surprised at the amount of traffic a gaming section provides to a store as well as the amount of people specifically preferring physical copies.

&#x200B;

I'm not sure why everything thinks everyone wants digital. Digital acquisition of items is currently the minority by a fairly large margin.

&#x200B;

Everyone also saying amazon already exist sound quite stupid. It's like saying why do other stores, websites operate because Amazon has already won. Should every store close down now to bow down to amazon?
There's people that still think the stock market behaves as if you can buy a 20% bond and that the stocks are the risky investment.

Yes, I guess it depends on whether you're a follower or a contrarian. But it can stop you from making stupid moves. For example, if you want to buy an OTM call in February and you see others don't have much interest in it, you'd think twice before going ahead with the purchase.

You can net losses and gains from the same time period.  You can only write off 3k of losses from normal income if you don't have any gains tealized to offset the losses.  But you can carry any losses in excess of the 3k to forward years for future gains or an additional 3k/year normal income write off.

ARK better explode on Monday pls
Gamestop has historically relied on 2 things to drive profit:   
   1. pre-owned games  
   2. Pre-orders that ensure games are bought through them.  


Let's address these.  


Pre-owned games: The ever expanding digital market of games is going to eat this segment alive. Add to that the subscription models that are growing in popularity and that problem becomes more significant. Many people that would have, once upon a time, bought a game and traded it in are going to either buy digitally because the digital only console was cheaper or it's more convenient, or use subscription services because it's a more economical system for their playing habits. As players become more comfortable with the digital model (Steam has stopped anyone I know from buying physical copies of games for over 10 years now) this business model only sinks more and more.

Pre-orders: Back in the day, before Amazon was a thing and the electronics sections in places like Walmart are as large as they are now, they played on FOMO for pre-orders. "You won't get the game when it comes out if you don't pre-order". That stopped working when manufacturing and distribution of games improved and Amazon connected anyone to anything they wanted. Now you can be pretty well assured to find your game when you want it. Then they made deals for pre-order exclusives. If you truly wanted ALL the content you needed to pre-order through Gamestop. That kind-of worked until other people started doing it too. They seem to be out of ideas now, and there is no real reason to pre-order games through GME. Hell, many gamers have been burned by pre-ordering games or see it as completely unnecessary. Pre-ordering is just an archaic, dying philosophy.

SO... one now has to ask: What's next? What can GME transition to that can be profitable? Let's face it. Without something crazy innovative they are too far behind. Every major big box general retailer has whole sections of their stores dedicated to physical systems, games, accessories, and collectibles/toys. Amazon has a stranglehold on the web market. GME isn't going to win by just doing what they are doing. They need to be better. They need to break people out of their established shopping habits  and decide that GME is the place to do their gaming shopping. So far I haven't heard what is going to pull them out of this death spiral.

ARK has been buying Nintendo NTDOY for months in the $60-$80 range .
I love America but sometimes I wonder. 

For some reason the two gas stations I stopped at in Texas were not working. The first pump I rolled up to had the yellow things on them but the one in front had someone leaving so I rolled up to that one. The screen shows nada so I go in to pay.  Use the bathroom,  come out and some guy is buying 1m in money orders. Finally my turn,  "they're all broke, we have..." bye. I see a guy putting the yellow things on more pumps and ppl yelling at the screens. I drive down the road to the next one and the machine doesn't accept my card. Immediately I think I'm broke but Chase says I'm up. So I go in and pay. While I'm pumping,  I see the same people from the other station and a few others trying to insert their card over and over. "Try debit!".... "Mine  is off too!". It wasn't until I finished pumping that one of these idiots went in the store.
Yup same tax year
Let’s hope so

Are you referring to the comment above?
“We have police brutality in the West”

We do, and that’s a problem to address. However, we (the US) do have judicial remedies to address them, such as Sec. 1983 litigation.

“You can actually go to jail for criticizing more than just the govt here”

Are you referring to hate speech laws, like those in the U.K.? We (the US) don’t have those; our exceptions to the First Amendment are narrowly drawn and not likely to expand anytime soon. Only true threats, incitement, criminally fraudulent misrepresentations, and the like will subject one to criminal prosecution, not simply saying bad things about the government or the police. Again, these exceptions are well-defined and narrowly-drawn in the relevant caselaw.

“Stealing resources is basically enabled”. See recent CCP belligerence re South China Sea.

“Uighers should probably get their own homeland.” Not sure how to respond to that, frankly.

It will get back up and you will either be able to get out at your entry point and red days will end for you, or stay for longer and get some nice tendies. Your choice, but for now stay calm (I know it is hard, been there 3 weeks ago, nothing nice).

Next time don't invest if you are not ready to lose (some).

Yes. His fund is down 12.7% through November year to date and up 3.2% annually since inception of 07/2011. You could have done better in a certificate of deposit.

Switch to weekly and look back further than the past 6 months. I see what you mean though there was a daily gap on the last earnings that gave a massive step up. When plotting my support and resistance levels I like to look over the whole history of the chart. Around 18 we've had two tests on that support. Yes theres a break at the moment but it will be good to see if there is just some stop hunting at play.

Tesla is also conservative on what they consider a delivery compared to traditional auto companies. They can count a car being at a dealership as a delivery where Tesla counts it as car in hand to a buyer.

Thank you, the auctions snatch up property really fast. Also if the other players have less money than the property is worth you can start an auction and bid $1 more than the other player has.

Apple will likely partner with an existing car manufacturer to go into their Apple Car venture rather than trying to build up their own car manufacturing capability from the ground up.

Road to recovering my remaining 57k losses:

2) take all new capital and yeet it into more credit spreads on NVDA for the next two weeks. Should net $10-15k. Leaving about 25k left

3) repeat again once more and should be damn close to recovery. Let's get this bread bois

You are missing the forest for the trees, though. This is just another sign of the nigh inevitable death of the company. Closing these less profitable locations will certainly help them hold on a bit longer, but they have communicated no viable business model that succeeds in the coming gaming landscape.
If they're on 8 year cycles, this might be the last one. 

A lot can happen in 8 years. For example, most cars sold will be fully autonomous, a $1000 laptop will have as much computing power as the human race combined, robots will aide Japan's inversely aged population in nursing homes (literally insufficient younger population to take care of all elders) so expect an iRobot-like future very soon, SpaceX will have completed two launch cycles of cruise ships to Mars (shortest martian launch window ~2yrs), and fewer people will desire optical drives in their game consoles 🤣

Buying the thing outright would take a tremendous amount of capital. If I know rich people like I think I do, they like to put the least amount of skin in the game possible to achieve their goals.

As for the board seat, I think he wants to be in control. I have a prior post where I touched on this briefly - check my post history and the one right after the Q3 call.

Everyone has competition

Doordash controls more of the delivery market than any copetition they have.

Diordash stock has declined since IPO for all the negative reasons you guys mention so to suggest itll drop way more isnt a great move imo. Like I said, they do massive revenues and are the biggest in their sector. They arent profitable because they are rapidly expanding.

Did you know even small non restauraunts were using doordash to get deliveries done because they couldnt rely on the post office?


My advice, you dont like doordash? Stay away. There are easier things to buy puts on

If all you are basing your reasoning for puts is "they dont belong in that marketcap and are way overvalued" well you need to look at the thousands of other way overvalued companies too. Palantir in a market cap with companies doingbten times their quarterly revenue who all probably have brighter futures based on reality and not wishful yhinking of memes.

Here is how the Chinese government historically has treated US companies. This is as good a summary of the issue as you’ll find, a key excerpt from https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nytimes.com/2020/01/15/business/china-technology-transfer.amp.html

“China has repeatedly shown that it can acquire technology and, through heavy government subsidies, build competitive rivals to American companies. Businesses worry that it could do the same in other industries, like software and chips.

China has long denied that it forces foreign companies to give up technology. They do it willingly, Beijing asserts, to get access to China’s vast and growing market. Still, Chinese officials say they are taking steps to address the concerns.

...

American companies say Chinese companies also use more subtle tactics to get access to valuable technology.

Sometimes China requires foreign companies to form joint ventures with local firms in order to do business there, as in the case of the auto industry. It also sometimes requires that a certain percentage of a product’s value be manufactured locally, as it once did with wind turbines and solar panels.

The technology companies Apple and Amazon set up ventures with local partners to handle data in China to comply with internal security laws.

Companies are loath to accuse Chinese partners of theft for fear of getting punished. Business groups that represent them say Chinese companies use those corporate ties to pressure foreign partners into giving up secrets. They also say Chinese officials have pressured foreign companies to give them access to sensitive technology as part of a review process to make sure those products are safe for Chinese consumers.

Foreign business groups point to renewable energy as one area where China used some of these tactics to build homegrown industries.

Gamesa of Spain was the wind turbine market leader in China when Beijing mandated in 2005 that 70 percent of each wind turbine installed in China had to be manufactured inside the country. The company trained more than 500 suppliers in China to manufacture practically every part in its turbines. It set up a plant to assemble them in the city of Tianjin. Other multinational wind turbine manufacturers did the same.

The Obama administration questioned the policy as a violation of World Trade Organization rules and China withdrew it, but by then it was too late. Chinese state-controlled enterprises had begun to assemble turbines using the same suppliers. China is now the world’s biggest market for wind turbines, and they are mostly made by Chinese companies.“

That’s a pretty big perspective and a lot of history to ignore.
For what price?

No. Okay, so firstly, technology in gaming and it's expansion is not what you're thinking at all. In fact this would be the destruction of GME, you've got it backwards, because GME is basically like the old Music Industry where games were held by means of rights and DRM and so forth and so on and that wall is breaking down; the losses on revenue from pirating games is staggering and growing as times go on meanwhile the expansion of gaming technology, that is, games that [can literally be played with thoughts](https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/12/16/brain-computer-gaming/), is not where GME will ever land.
I wasn't sure about that, so I went away and did some calculations and $300 is definitely above zero so it checks out.
Holy shit man.

This is me over the past year, but mostly long shares and a dash of puts when things are too lofty (like now). All the “normies” in my life think I’m broke or something because I don’t buy new shiny shit. Some dude I work with is always buying new shit right when it comes out and wonders why he can’t get approved for a decent sized mortgage. My aim is to eventually get to a point where my annual portfolio gains exceed my annual income from work. In 2020, my portfolio gains were equal to 20% of my annual income from twerk. Hoping to get that up to 100% in the years to come.

Yeah but two good quarters of earnings is not worth a 25% corporate tax rate and way more regulation.

No, there were companies based solely on a domain name during the DotCom bubble that made CEOs multimillionaires overnight for a shitty website name or idea that was a fuckin joke. So at least Tesla makes something of quality and value, with amazing Brand recognition for a reason. So I would say it is in no way the most over valued company.

Socialism isn’t when “tHe GuBeRmEnT” does stuff. It does not have that much to do with government at all really. 

It’s when the workers own the means of production. 

It’s not that hard of a concept to grasp.

It's okay man.  I've found that the success stories here are toxic because they are so easy to focus on.  A lot of the people having success here also already have high paying jobs and advantages that you, I, or most of us don't have. 

 Just to give you a sense of solidarity, I recently turned 28, and just graduated college this year with a BS in Math.  I still haven't gotten a "real" job, I'm making 13.50/hr in my midwestern state just trying to keep my head up too.  Something that has me hopeful is that I've recently started serious consideration to do the Pacific Crest Trail, which makes me happy.

I agree that our own system is corrupt and we’ve become quite “communist” in effect if not name over here. But I believe in the fundamental values espoused in the constitution of this country and I think we can still get back to that. 

But the China apologists seems disingenuous to me, I would take our flawed system over chinas any day. 

And I would disagree that our elites are anti-China. If they were we would have stopped trading with them a long time ago.

As someone with a degree in economics and finance. Let me just say this shit still make sense man lol 

Goes against everything I was taught about the market
I mean, we have police brutality in the West, you can actually got to jail for criticizing more than just the gov't here, we (Canada, America, Britain, etc.) also have a total surveillance system, stealing resources (from us) is basically enabled by our gov'ts, Uighers should probably get their own homeland, idk  
I do agree with you that China has a "bad and unsustainable" economy- which is causing much environmental damage. But I would put the responsibility for that on our elites for allowing corporations to move from North America to China in the first place, then not doing enough to bring those jobs back.  


I don't like or trust China nor do I desire to invest in their companies, but it seems like the propaganda against them is made so our elite can save face and distract us from their own corruption.

You hit the nail on the head. 

In my opinion the only thing keeping Alibaba down is the China risk premium.

If you believe the China risk premium will persist permanently  then Alibaba is definitely not undervalued as you say, but if you believe the China risk premium will lessen in time then Alibaba is certainly undervalued. 

I'm on the China risk premium lessening boat, but I certainly see both sides as a possibility going forward.

NO GME OPTIONS. God damn. Buy shares.
If it looks like I'll have to roll them, that's fine, but I don't want to pay 2 weeks of theta for a binary event that is 90% likely to play out before Friday. 

Buying an extra week of theta would protect downside, but might not be the right play in this specific scenario.

I think earnings will beat. I think the stock moves up AFTER earnings 

However, It broke its support that could have it easily fill its downgap BEFORE earnings. This is important bc if it does drop BEFORE earnings there is likely to be a bunch of shorts closing which could take away from a potential squeeze.

A stock im definitely watching next week. If the down gap doesn’t fill I’ll pick up calls and if it does fill then I’ll likely still pick up calls just at a different strike. It’s movement post earnings will be dependent on how this stock moves throughout the week and how many shorts close out their position.

I hear ya. I got in at 160 so I made some decent profits. It's definitely a safe stock but I'm having FOMO if I sell it but also don't want to miss tsla rocket.
Im not entirely sure how much but im fairly certain that the first innovations in manufactoring or transportation were pretty hyped too. In some crazy numbers. So i wouldnt be so sure about "in history part" since some sort of stocks were a thing for 200years in west europe. Ye it is likely to fall if all other stocks do. But it also may just slow the price growth eventually while actuall growth starts to outpace its price growth.  That would work in making it less overvalued too woudnt it.

We will be lucky to break 51 imo. It's priced in at this point and they've already revealed everything they will be showing on NIO Day. If there's some sort of huge surprise then maybe you'll hit, but highly doubt it. Also CEO has already hinted and not hitting December delivery numbers.
Wrong on both accounts. Good luck with your false pattern recognition.
It’s almost like you aren’t supposed to take a flight back home during a pandemic 😳
Yeah same here. I think America is still fixable but I’m not holding my breath. Once I get rich and if things get worse here I’ll move to some 3rd world country.

It's called discipline and you have none that's why you can't control your emotions. 

Seriously, call the VA help line, they can help you more than an ass kicking would.

Agreed, but unless the CCP is disbanded the China risk premium will be a permanent feature of these securities. Assuming that's the case, multiples will permanently be depressed compared to US securities- doubt you'll see multiple expansion, but who knows - maybe you will.

If shareholder returns aren't fueled by multiple expansion, they need to come from growth in the underlying business. I think this is entirely plausible for Baba, and *if* I had to bet on any Chinese company I suppose it would be Baba, but that's what you'd be betting on.

I certainly wouldn't say Baba is undervalued though. And I certainly wouldn't compare it to Amazon on a multiple basis.

Some societies are beyond repair. I live in Europe, it's just as much of a shit show. Goal is to get rich enough to no longer care about society.

It's like an endless wheel of retards in our democracy.
Civil War = bullish right?
😳
How is missing one target by .09% during a pandemic considered a “red flag miss if you’re a long term hyperbull”? I would think that this maybe would cause some slight unrest in the very short term paper hand traders, but if you really believe in Tesla’s long term story (5-10+ years) then this shouldn’t faze you in the slightest. 

Elon’s knack of aiming for the stars and landing on the moon is what has made him and his companies so successful at disrupting industries, not a point of weakness.

Thanks :)
It has got to 600B market cap with not even a million sold. What's your point? Tesla is about the autonomous and data its accumulating as more cars are being sold.  End game is autonomous.  It will hit 1T before it tanks.
Exactly. I don't even know what I would do with a billion. I'm just a personality in a meat suit. Give me a couple mil and I'll have the finest beer available in a fridge with a nice view of a warm ocean until I expire.

Most of what I'd want to do with my time doesn't cost any money, it just requires being left alone by corporate assholes during the day.

Future of USA
Unironically, it’s time to start an “Electric Airplane” company and call it Aerotyne International.
I finished down -$9,193.89 for the YTD, mainly because I'm a Gay Bear.

At peak in the middle of March, I was up $21k, after I had already withdrawn cash to pay off all of my student loans.

I had about $21,000 in Puts on 3/6/20, but sold them all right before market close because of the market rising at the end of the day and wanted to lock in gains to pay off student loan debt, and got scared. If I would have held them through the weekend, value would probably jumped to six figures.

After selling them early, I continued to try and chase as a Gay Bear for the rest of the rise (pretty much until June) before I decided to just save for a big Yolo.

I was going to Yolo on ZM on 8/31/20, but I thought the premiums on the calls were too expensive, and declined against it. Naturally, all Call on 9/1/20 went up 1000% to 4000% the next day.

So I annoyed, depressed, etc. I decide to Yolo on RKT Calls on 9/2/20 when it was trading around $34 a share, and of course crashed in the proceeding days. Realistically, I bought the Calls at 3:00 PM EST, and the stock immediately started going down.

We can refinance anytime we want. I can buy a crib tomorrow and then refinance it every couple months if I wanted too. It would make zero sense to do so, but we can. 

What is the point of making you wait 5 years to do a refi? It doesn’t make sense to me from a capitalist or an investment standpoint at all. 

We too can take out as much cash as we want as long as we maintain 20% equity of appraisal. 25% on investment properties.

Reading your section on product I'm left asking one question.

How many electric trucks are there really, that need a retrofit for regenerative braking?

A few statements for your consideration:

The entire market runs on diesel trucks, unless you've got rabid battery swap EV versions only get 1/4th of the daily mileage, unusable.

Any new EV is going to have regenerative braking, more than a dozen companies have their own design.  I'm doubtful your chubby young man has anything to offer that Volkswagen's teams of every relevant professional can't make their own version of.

I read that ETSY has huge potential growth in the coming years, but the stock may be overvalued after its rapid ascent from March to now.

The stock recently started dropping, and The Motley Fool published [this article](https://www.fool.com/investing/2021/01/02/got-2000-3-top-stocks-to-buy-for-2021/) which states that "its impressive upside potential is worth the price tag." They also referred to ETSY as a surefire e-commerce stock.

We get terms for the life of the loan generally. There used to be a lot of interest only stuff happening before the crash, but then then you didn’t have to redo terms, they just floated after the fact. No forced renewal. 

We call it a refinance here. And most are either in 15 or 30 year terms. When our terms are over, the house is paid off. Never heard of having to refinance it every 5 years at the new rates. That’s kind of shitty. Good for the banks I guess.

No one expects that Tesla will crash right now. The current valuation is super optimistic, basically not rational. Just hype and probably some FOMO. Only time will tell how long this will continue for. Moreover one can still comment on a stock without actively trading it.

whats going to print better: 1) ICLN Shares  2) AAPL calls 140, 150, 160 for  1/22, 06/22, 1/23
Pretty big volume on AAPL 3/17/23 90c on Thursday. Somebody's bullish for the next couple years (or very short).

It’s my style of investing. I have 10 holdings and PLTR will be my largest. I do things a little different than a lot of people on here, and I’m okay with that. There are tons of other companies I also see doing well in the future, and I don’t feel like hitching my future to one horse.
Didn't realize I have 90% of my account in 1/15 tech calls since I kept on doubling down. How f***** am I?
Agreed, if you are patient you can set lowball orders that get panic filled and almost always immediately rebound
[removed]
These people just don’t get it man let it pass em by
There would be a 'bid' and an 'ask' the more liquid the market the closer the two. When someone puts a market order in with their broker to buy they would be matched with the cheapest 'ask' and so on and resting orders would get filled oldest to newest. Like I said the more liquid the market the closer the bid and the ask will be. The price you look up on Google will be a 10 minute delay price but someone with a live screen could tell you the last trade up to the second and because there is generally plenty of volume, your market fill should be very close to the last trade.

You're missing the point. Doesn't make him a good person just bc you would think of doing the same thing. He is a piece of shit and I stand by what I said. All CEOs of big companies are assholes who do mental gymnastics to think of themselves as philanthropists or some retarded shit while using child labor in Indonesia or some other country they outsourced labor from. Specially in the US, this whole country was built on slave labor which turned into the prison system that legalized slave labor and turning minorities into slaves for minor offenses like smoking weed.

Shares? Why tho. I get opportunity cost but do you have a better play to make money for sure?
Waiting for the new season to come out for that
Won’t work
If the company pays a dividend while the shares are sold short, then the shorts must pay.

Nobody is expecting GME to pay a dividend, I'm in on this play and I will be beyond pissed off if they pay a dividend. That money needs to go into growing their ecommerce which is way behind the times.

Ran it through PIO,

Math checks out; GTO play is 69% Shares, 31% June calls. 

Maximum exploitive play would be to buy as many OTM calls 1 day before squeeze. However the EV of this play strictly depends on the weight assigned to the date of squeeze.

If you haven't dealt with the CCP, you don't know how it functions. As it turns out, both groups of people exist in the party: the group of responsible caretakers and the bad corrupt people. They're actually the two main metafactions, beyond even loyalty to a given high-ranking guy. In a city, province, or any other subdivision locally dominated by one of these metafactions, it pays a lot to be part of the other. Elon could have had the good fortune of dealing with the responsible caretakers, but you never know since he'll say the same regardless.

I sold $60C 1/29 NIO plenty of time left, but already preparing myself to have to roll these out as there’s a strong chance it could close above $60 by then with NIO day upcoming. When would be best time to roll out to a higher strike? Wait for it to go ITM or roll before if it looks to be headed that way. I think there will be a decent run up to NIO day this coming week, followed by an inevitable pull back the following week. I’d prefer to hold on to these shares rather than letting them execute and buying back.

Ryan Cohen owns over 9 million shares, all of which have been sold short by others.

68.13M shares have been sold short total (as at 12/15/20), it would take 5.7 trading days at current average volume for all shorts to cover.

Shorts are currently 135% of float (market watch) with 19 million of the 69 million shares locked away by insiders.

It's very much primed for a squeeze if it doesn't blockbuster, it is currently priced like a distressed company (yes even at $20), and would 2x comfortably on just a few quarters of solid and stable revenue and increased profitability.
So he´s basically the standard requirement to be a part of this sub.
Dude are you retarded (dumb question, clearly yes).

NIO needs to hit $54 at market open Monday, for these to go up, not just "leading up to NIO day". These are going to be leaking money out of every orifice due to Theta, not a chance NIO pops off hard enough for this guy to make money.

Musk is indeed a smart and insightful man. He has an understanding of the Chinese that a lot of us lack. Not our fault though; our institutions and elites have many reasons to make China into a boogeyman.  
Keeping up the facade of freedom is one of those reasons. Gotta make the other guy (China) look like he has no freedoms at all. Yet look at the pictures comparing New Year's Eve celebrations in New York City and Wuhan- very telling.

Why so?  Still don't have delivery numbers. Rumors floating about Model Y price cut has hurt NIO orders. Battery day feels damn near priced in at this point. If deliveries aren't over 7k for December (which the CEO has already hinted it may not hit expectations) it's going to hurt.  Not to mention the 3 china companies getting delisted could cause a scare for American investors...

Note that I hold 400 shares and quite a few LEAPs for NIO. I just try to be realistic when talking about NIO

>Who tf goes to GameStop

People who don’t have Amazon prime or even a credit card for that matter. Not everyone can afford multiple $60 games every year. Some are relying on trading in played games to buy a  used game.

Can a retailer make money off poorer customers? The answer is undoubtedly yes. Just look at dollar tree and dollar general. However unlikely those two stores, GameStop is not selling cheap crap at a discount. Instead they are selling expensive stuff with little to no discount. I just don’t see it going to the moon anytime soon. It’s more likely to crash and burn at the current pace...
But that's a different type of service from what is being talked about here. This is more of an electronic device service where you call and say "hey, this function isn't working", the big pushback against EVs from legacy auto dealers is that they don't require nearly the same amount of maintenance service, which is where they make a lot of their money
Buy puts then gay bear, but anyways thank you :)
Same. If I was a billionaire I would tell them to fuck off and not do any business with them. Source all the manufacturing I need domestically or from other countries, even if it costs more. Our elites don’t have any conviction or courage and that’s why we are where we are.

Pleas fly again might be as iconic as GUH.. so simple yet so poetic.
Dress well: start by spending $300 on a few nice shirts/pants. That's like 2 meme stock FDs that were probably going to expire worthless anyway because, let's be honest you're on WSB. Marshall's/TJ MAXX/Nordstrom Rack are a great way to get a basic level wardrobe upgrade for cheap. Jeans/T-shirt is fine for errands, but if you're gonna be in an even remotely social/semi-professional situation, wear your nice clothes. People notice. 

Good hygiene: this is one that doesn't necessarily get noticed on its own but people notice when you don't practice it. Shower/brush your teeth/floss/wear deodorant **every day**. Even if you're not planning to be around people. It's a cumulative effect. 

Find a hobby: not stonks. Something real and tangible that people might find interesting, but more importantly that **you** find interesting. Something that you get excited about. Make it part of your routine, but don't fetishize it and center your entire personality around it. Hobbies tend to lead you to other interests that you didn't know you had before. They can also come with the added benefit of social interactions with like minded people, which is a great basis for building relationships (both platonic and romantic). 

Physical activity: run, walk, lift weights, ride a bike. Doesn't matter. Being physically fit is attractive to most people, working out is like an attractiveness buff. Even if you're born ugly, you'll be less ugly if you're in shape. Go on r/progresspics some time and look at the difference it can make. Plenty of ugly people look **a lot** more attractive once they get in shape. Working out also teaches you discipline and routine which a lot of people find attractive. And seeing a physical transformation can yield **tons** of confidence, which leads me to... 

Confidence: it's the single most attractive thing in people. Confidence is a palpable trait and people are drawn to it (probably because so few of us have it). I know telling people who don't have it to be confident sounds like telling people with depression to just "be happy". But it's something that you can start teaching yourself to manifest before any other substantive changes. Self awareness is great to a point but if you constantly tell yourself your a 1/10, 2/10 etc. then that's how other people will see you, which just depeens the cycle. Tell yourself you're worthwhile. If you fuck up, tell yourself you made a mistake rather than calling yourself retarded. If you don't like something about yourself, tell yourself you are going to work on it rather than calling yourself a piece of shit. It makes. A huge. Difference. It takes time, and practice but it's the simplest and most worthwhile thing you can do. If you don't love yourself how in the hell can you expect anyone else to? 

Or just YOLO into GME and become a fucking millionaire by next week. You'll still be lonely but at least money buys happiness so fuck it.

No joke. You want to know why AK-47s are so ubiquitous? Because they equipped their army with them, only to replace them with better AKs and sell the originals to third world allies. Thus, guns as old as my father have been used by men who wouldn't even know to clean the barrel with oil are all over the world... And guess what? They still work!

Another example is Soviet cars also largely still work. They simply took western car designs, beefed up the suspension and other parts, and used foam filled tires instead of pneumatic. The result had mediocre performance and still a large price tag, but required little maintenance and would outlast the operators.

Check back on Monday you might be very surprised at what you see
fall? it may but then again it may also rally into earnings and fall from $35 to $30. very hard to predict these things. this is why I just buy shares and hold long term. buy more if there are any big dips. 

do some research on all the 10-20 baggers these last few years. okta, pton, crwd, twlo etc. many ppl were right about the stocks but wrong on the dates. their calls expire worthless only for the underlying  to moonshot a month later.  $5k into each of those meme stocks in Jan 2018 is now worth $160k.

To have some services? Yes typical. Usually companies with less services seem to have higher valuation multiples though (not always the case but people value straight SaaS revenue higher than services).

Don't worry about supply chain. I work for a vendor of Foxconn, our factory does'nt even closed during april. In asia (except india), the number of covid case is much lower than europe because our enviroment is shitty, air pollution is common so even if covid is not present people still wear mask. Furthermore, in asia we don't believe in human rights, we do what gorverment told us to do. And the last thing, social stigma in asia country is much more severely than europe, if you have covid and transmit it to other people, you will be harshly criticized, so harsh that seppuku is the only choice

TLDR; we wear mask

Full text of Xi Jinping's 2021 New Year address: 

"Comrades, friends, ladies and gentlemen, greetings to you all! 

The year 2021 is arriving. From China's capital Beijing, I extend my New Year wishes to you all! 

2020 was an extraordinary year. Facing the sudden coronavirus pandemic, we put people and their lives first to interpret the great love among humans. With solidarity and resilience, we wrote the epic of our fight against the pandemic. 

During the days when we addressed the hardships together, we saw the heroic spirit of marching straight to the frontlines, holding posts with tenacity, taking responsibility to get through thick and thin, sacrifices with bravery, and touching moments of helping each other. 

From medical workers to the people's army, from scientific researchers to community workers, from volunteers to those who built the projects, from seniors to youths born after the 1990s and 2000s, numerous people fulfilled their missions at the cost of their lives and protected humanity with sincere love. 

They pooled their drops of strength into tremendous power and built an iron wall to safeguard lives. Many figures marched ahead without hesitation, many relays were accomplished hand in hand, many scenes showed touching moments, all these vividly illustrate the great spirit of fighting against the pandemic. 

Greatness is forged in the ordinary. Heroes come from the people. Every person is remarkable! 

Our sympathy goes to all the unfortunate ones infected with the coronavirus! We salute all the ordinary heroes! 

I am proud of our great motherland and people, as well as the unyielding national spirit. Only in hard times can courage and perseverance be manifested. Only after polishing can a piece of jade be finer. We overcame the impact of the pandemic, and made great achievements in coordinating prevention and control and in economic and social development. 

The 13th Five-Year Plan has been accomplished in full. The 14th Five-Year Plan is being comprehensively formulated. We are accelerating the pace to set up a new pattern for development, and are deeply implementing high-quality development. 

China is the first major economy worldwide to achieve positive growth, and its GDP in 2020 is expected to step up to a new level of 100 trillion yuan. China has seen a good harvest in grain production for 17 years in a row. China has seen breakthroughs in scientific explorations like the Tianwen-1 (Mars mission), Chang'e-5 (lunar probe), and Fendouzhe (deep-sea manned submersible). Construction of the Hainan Free Trade Port is proceeding with vigor. 

We also defeated severe flooding. With the military and civilians heedless of danger and difficulty, and standing in unity, we managed to minimize the damage of the floods. 

I inspected 13 provincial-level regions and was glad to see people carefully implementing coronavirus prevention and control measures, racing against time to resume work and production, and sparing no efforts to advance innovation. 

Everywhere were vibrant scenes of confident, resilient people making the most of every minute. In 2020, China made the historic achievement of establishing a moderately prosperous society in all respects and achieved decisive success in eradicating extreme poverty. 

We launched the final assault on the fortress of entrenched rural poverty, and cracked this "hardest nut."

Through 8 years, under the current standard, China has eradicated extreme poverty for the nearly 100 million rural people affected, and all the 832 impoverished counties have shaken off poverty. 

These years, I have visited 14 contiguous areas of dire poverty. The unremitting efforts of the folks and the wholehearted contribution of the poverty-eradication cadres often come to my mind. 

We still need to stay tenacious like a bamboo deeply rooted in the rocks, keep our feet on the ground, and work hard to paint a magnificent picture of rural vitalization, and steadily march ahead towards the goal of common prosperity. 

This year, we celebrated the 40th anniversary of the Shenzhen Special Economic Zone, among others, and 30 years of the development and opening-up of Pudong in Shanghai. As I stood on the southern coast as the spring tide surged and on the colorful bank of the Huangpu River, my mind was filled with a myriad of thoughts. 

Pilot trials have become models and leading forces, and explorations to innovate have become leading forces of innovation. The opening-up and reform has created miracles of development. In the future, we should further deepen reform and expand opening-up with greater courage, and create more "Stories of Spring." 

We are not alone on the Great Way and the whole world is one family. After a year of hardship, we can understand more than ever the significance of a community with a shared future for mankind. 

I had many phone calls with friends from the international community, both old and new, and attended many "cloud conferences." What we discussed most was staying united to combat the pandemic. 

We still have a long way to go in pandemic prevention and control. People from all over the world should join hands and support each other to early dispel the gloom of the pandemic and strive for a better "Earth home." 

2021 will see the 100th birthday of the Communist Party of China. Its 100-year journey surges forward with great momentum. Its original aspiration remains even firmer one hundred years later. 

From Shikumen in Shanghai to the South Lake in Jiaxing City, the small red boat (where the first CPC congress concluded) bore the great trust of the people and the hope of the nation. The boat has sailed through turbulent rivers and treacherous shoals, and has voyaged across violent tidal waves, becoming a great ship that navigates China's stable and long-term development. 

The CPC bears its eternal great cause in mind, and the centenary only ushers in the prime of life. We adhere to putting people at the center, stay true to our original aspiration, keep our mission well in mind, break the waves and sail out for our journey ahead, and we will certainly realize the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation. 

At the historic crossroad of the "Two Centenary Goals," the new journey of comprehensively building a modern socialist country is about to start. The road ahead is long; striving is the only way forward. We have strived, broken through brambles and thorns, and crossed ten thousand rivers and thousands of mountains. 

We will continue to strive, march ahead with courage, and create brighter glory! At just this moment, the festive lanterns have been lit, and family members gather for reunion. The New Year is coming. I wish our land to be splendid, our country to be prosperous, and our people to live in peace. I wish you all a harmonious, smooth and auspicious year, full of happiness! 

Thank you!”

Agree, it definitely will. Most people are buying model 3 due to lack of affordable luxury EV options (audi etron is too expensive) and also the brand value (like Apple). 

The TSLA gravy train will continue for another 1-2 years max and then competition is going to be much more intense, and stock price will plateau for some time. Flaw tolerance that might be passable today wont be as easily glossed over by buyers since there will be more options in the same price range. But for now, there's still enough growth catalysts to keep it going to as high as $1k.

Well clearly your problem was owning more than 1 tesla now, wasn’t it 😛
I would all in on $GUH!
Tesla deliveries underwhelming. Current P/E is nearly 1,400. Common sense indicates a sharp correction is inevitable.

Therefore it will open at $750 on Monday and hit $850 by EOW.

Listen nio is releasing delivery numbers soon either Monday or Tuesday if and I mean if they beat hold because the whole week it might run to the next catalyst which is nio day. However small the chance of these two things go our way you still have a chance. Good luck 👍

That's a clear shower then though. Golden showers have to be thick like a simple syrup and Amber as a field of wheat. Otherwise your just getting pissed on imo

Removed my original reply. I got confused with what thread this was.

An ATM call is less capital intensive and will likely see immediate returns. More of a swing play, the way I look at it.
It's a Saturday. This is the weekend thread. I don't see an issue.
They barely missed 500,000 deliveries. 

https://ir.tesla.com/press-release/tesla-q4-2019-vehicle-production-deliveries
They already have exclusive deals for DLC and day one release content right? They could have all kinds of specials on games and compete with those monopolized vendors that currently have 0 competition. 

Idk its a stretch for sure, but they have so much brand potential and such a massive consumer database.
[removed]
Fucking RIP
>Smart traders are constantly shorting 

Judging solely on recent returns, these 'smart traders' who constantly short sell would have made MUCH better returns if they had just gone long instead of trying to time a scalp on a dip. No denying that, so calling people clowns is a bad look when you're arguing your trading strategy since it generated much less alpha.

Your second point is kinda the equivalent of believing that no one in the world needs food because you just ate. Not gonna go and list all the industries that are basically leveled due to the virus. 

lol if you think that amount is enough to dilute the dollar. We gave out significantly more than that in the previous relief bill, just didnt go to people.

This, my first option play was end of year puts on tesla obviously lost everything.  I thought s and p inclusion was a catalyst for the dump part of the pump and dump, was wrong. I talked myself into it because I was protecting my portfolio from forced index buying.  Have one left to make back cost basis if people were waiting for new year to sell, doubt it will work.  I mean theoretically it doesn't need to pop. It could get eroded away by inflation over the next 100 years and pull an atnt or something.  Is the price irrational, yes, can anyone call the drop, probably, is that person me? Definitely not.

So China is pissed their companies got delisted, seems bullish like China won’t shoot themselves by delisting more
I used to be heavily involved in retail.  Long stream of consciousness follows sorry.

The opex of interstore xfers can be huge, essentially can only do it for publicity and customer goodwill, its a guaranteed money loser.  If you're gonna lose 20% by shipping to another store or 15% by same store "liquidation" sales, sell it.  Not all liquidation sales are 90% off LOL in fact you'll see tons of supposed shutdowns where the percent off is like 5%, so lame.  Still lures in the legacy boomers who expect 90% off and they shop anyway even if they only see 5% off LOL.  Who cares if they get pissed and never come back the place is closing anyway.

Accounting handwaving about one-time expenses near capex-alike for liquidation vs punishing your opex with transfer costs.  And then there's shrinkage which is never 0% for transfers.  And some neighbor store's manager performance bonus depends on keeping THEIR opex low so Fing it up by shipping them junk isn't going to help.

Remember most of the stuff shipped is junk that doesn't sell and profit per item is often a power law distribution.  They were NEVER going to make a profit off those 2005 gamecube extension cables that have been sitting in the back room for 15 years.  Most of the interstore xfer product would by definition be the junk nobody can sell so chucking it out isn't losing much forward profitability.  Almost none of the stuff interstore shipped is brand new iphones its all like MS Zunes with leaky batteries from a quarter century ago that they just can't get off the books.

Some revolving credit agreements get very weird about store closing costs vs normal daily operations expenses where you could have a legal argument for financial fraud if you manipulate the numbers to make it look like you "deserve" a bigger credit agreement than you earned thru actual sales and open location numbers.  In some situations your revolving credit bank agreement could be defrauded if you secretly turn your supposedly profitable retail store into essentially a very expensive warehouse and then try to get a loan based on that warehouse being a more profitable storefront.  Even if you're not intentionally doing fraud, the legal agreement might be very weird to maintain maximal visibility and deniability and so forth, so if you're closing a store just close the store don't get all sneaky about trading the good stuff to the good store and sending the discount garbage and recyclable computer monitors to the dead store.  Sneakily moving and trading stuff gets the accountants and lawyers all worked up and its simpler not to do it than to figure out the perfectly legal way to document that those older model android phone cases are worthless net negative scrap plastic whereas those not as old iphone cases are hyperprofitable gold.

Some franchise owners hate other franchise owners, and corporate politics is not exactly peace and love either.  So here's an interstore xfer invoice for 50 non-serial numbered iphone cases taped to a cardboard box containing a construction brick.  Now is that a crooked sales floor associate who replaced the box contents six years ago past the statute of limitations where I live, or the store manager covering up falsified low historical shrinkage numbers, or the sales associate who got downsized last week and has no forwarding address taking home his severance bonus to sell on ebay, or just good old fashioned truck driver theft, or a crook at the gaining store knowing the closing store will get blamed for everything or just any random joe who knows some police departments simply don't get a flying F and others go all Sherlock Holmes and he's willing to risk it?  And how do you account for and document this for corporate?  And theft seems simple to document, what about obviously damaged semi-unsellable product?  Like on paper thats a new book but the cover is creased and dirty and nobody gonna buy it, but it left the books at the old store as full price sellable product and here it is at the gaining store unsellable and who locally and at corporate is eating that in their annual performance report?

Do it bit by bit on pullback. Add a couple other winners like Dennison. These went wild when a small group of big money caught wind of the story. Soon all the big players will see what’s happening, remember or discover what has happened in past bull markets, and pile more money into these companies than currently exists in them combined. Spot prices are almost certainly going to 50–70 this year or next.

Just weeklies, so 4 days to expiration. It tends to be the most profitable way to sell calls. Plus PLTR is so volatile that I don’t want to sell farther out, as if it moons I don’t want to have to be holding on to a ‘useless’ stock for 2+ weeks while I wait for it to get assigned at a fraction of its value.
TSLA is expensive for Chinese markets. It’ll be a status symbol there more like a Porsche is here. NIO is  going to be middle to upper middle class urban professional’s car. Tesla will be for the riches and commie party power brokers.

*Friendly reminder from your neighborhood tard:* Next week is obviously going to be volatile with the Georgia runoffs. Bears are going to crawl out of their shitholes, jerk each other off and we’ll see a lot of “I told you so” comments and dancing bear posts. 

__DO NOT LET THEM FOOL YOU__ The following week, we’re going to see green dildos as tall as skyscrapers. Trillions will come pouring into the markets. Bears will be wiped clean because they’re too dumb to take profits and once again be fuk. Bulls will once again reign supreme and ARK, PSTH and yes TSLA will soar to the heavens.
Not saying that Baba isn't a good co. (My analogy was just a joke.) But the multiple reflects (largely) three things:

1) There is a risk premium for investing in China -> sketchy country = lower multiple.

2) AliCloud is great, but it's no where near as good as AWS. Amazon's multiple largely reflects the forwards expectations (however rational) of AWS.

3) Furthermore, this is based on the assumption that Amazon's current multiple is rational. Granted, it is trading in a more reasonable range than most other mid-large cap growth companies, but I still think optimism is baked into the price. If we see a sector-wide correction a la March 2000, which I think we will, I expect Amazon will be negatively impacted as well. Much of AWS's growth is fueled by the same companies who will be left holding the bag when VC/Shelfs/Equity fundraising dry up. Can't pay for web services if you don't have any cash.

Tesla is also losing market share from its January high and issues with quality control are popping back up.

That is exactly what I am saying and here are more reasons why:

[Amazon Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AMZN/financials?p=AMZN)(USD)

[Alibaba Financials](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/BABA/financials?p=BABA)(CNY)

~~Take a look at those financials. Only bias dictates that Alibaba is shittier than Amazon. They beat them constantly YOY in total revenue and gross profits.~~

Edit: WOW That was foolish of me to not realize Alibaba's financials were in CNY. It would be nice if Yahoo Finance would convert that to USD automatically without having to do it manually, or give both tables.

Regardless I still stand by the P/E and PEG valuation metrics not to mention their excellent cash flow and debt to asset ratio.

I didn't actually get into mowing at all in 4 years.  Only reason I would add it is to get the more profitable jobs from the mowing clients.  Only nice thing about mowing is you don't need to quote it all the time once you have clients, I do quotes every night.  I keep telling myself I will add it, but its the hassle of building routes where I will probably lose money at first, since you need everything close together.

They already have an established revenue chain from government entities and are now moving towards the public sector. 

This kind of display caters exactly to that. How is a company doing exactly what they need to do to grow a bad thing?
I’m holding some BABA and think it will do reasonably well in the next few years. But the same bullish argument keeps getting circulated and it’s rather concerning. “Do you think the Chinese government would let one of their biggest companies fail??” ... yes. This is China. Not America. This is the country that welded shut apartment doors during covid to lock people inside. That throws protestors or opposition in internment camps or just straight up executes them. 

The government doesn’t care about BABA. They care about keeping control of China. And if alibaba keeps forcing themselves towards capitalism then the CCP will absolutely shut them down without a second thought. 

Anyone buying the dip should be extremely cautious with how much money they invest in this stock. This is a rare case where the downside potential is much larger than the upside.

#Ultra Tism
When I worked at Rocket all the shitty mortgage bankers who couldn’t cut it at Rocket, switched to go to United Wholesale.

United marketed to Rocket employees by promoting mediocrity and promising less hours and less competitive nature like what they’ve seen at RKT. UWM would get the most shit bagged bankers that were desperate to work in an environment where mediocrity was praised 😂

They kind of reminded me of a Planet Fitness trying to recruit fat people who had memberships at a LifeTime Fitness. “Come here fatties! We have pizza mondays!”

United Wholesale is smack dab in the middle of Pontiac michigan which is a complete shit hole, they can’t attract talent out of college. You would have to set your tinder search for at least 30 miles to attract at least fives or better 

Not to mention they are a fucking middle man in the mortgage business. They are the fucking Dunder Mifflin or mortgages. They have no exposure to direct to consumer which is growing more and more easier given the technological revolution. RKT does both: they are stealing market share from United’s wholesale business while growing their direct to consumer business.

Not to mention Rocket has 10 diversified companies under its umbrella, 3 that have international exposure to a country that is in desperate need of a large overhaul to their complex and archaic mortgage industry. 

TLDR: UWM is poor mans RKT

Don't ignore the that this is a cyclical company. Y/Y comps will decline and rise through the cycle. Wait for 2021 comps to pump out some big % beats comparative to 2020. What will you say when the next few quarters all show Y/Y growth? That is what needs to be factored in when valuing the future. 2020 numbers are all priced in, we are at $19/share and 2021 looks promising as the cycle goes from trough to peak over the next few years. Should see a much higher share price in 2021 than what we have today.
Ah yes fastly be like

That’s nice and all but CCP don’t like Jack Ma. I’m not against Chinese companies, got quite a bit of NIO, but BABA has problems unique to it that are going to be around for a while. ANT Is going to be forced to restructure in a way that craters it’s business model profitability as well, which lowers the value of BABAs stake

This is a short thesis gone wrong. Idk if I can find the graph now, but short interest shot up in early 2019; bears were betting Gamestop wouldn't make it to the new console cycle. Pandemic affecting brick and mortar led to even more short interest.

Gamestop shed underperforming stores, strengthened its financial position, and effectively ended the bankruptcy narrative. Shorts are now trapped, so no, the new console cycle was not really factored in.

in conclusion (TLDR): MT and VALE go 🚀🚀🌙

where can you buy scooby snacks? Is it on coinbase?
I have no skin in the game but just reading through and looking at your analysis, its seems extremely bullish. On the fact that as a gamestop customer, its never had good customer service, never had good treatment on employees, its closing stores, it's online store isnt the most fantastic, there's no sign the current ceo can turn around, if they could, they would have. The countless discount on switch game, even people manipulating their second hand prices to buy games and gain points is ridiculous. Just watch nintendo deals, etc on subs. They constantly having huge discount on stuff just in 2020.

I dunno who this RC person is and even if he bought out the whole company, how is he turning the company around? Like does he have huge experience in the digital space in terms of online sales, marketing because this is all about execution. Online selling is extremely hard, and its not like ganestop has a huge fanbase customer loyal to them, maybe im wrong. What's the probability, pausiblity and possibility when sales are going to the platforms itself in nintendo, microsoft and sony in the long run as the big push to digital comes. Are all of you in this for a short possible play?

So if your statement is correct wouldn't more ps5 sales be the consoles that are exclusively for digital with no disc drive? They are not.  There is a culture of archiving where people like to buy physical discs and have a collection. Can you share your digital game copies with your friends and take turns playing each others games? No. Why would you buy the console where you have to pay to play every single game when you could get the one where you and your buddies could all buy different games and swap amongst each other? Sure lots of things are going digital, but not everyone wants to spend the bandwith downloading 50-100 gigs for one game when they can install the disc and then just download smaller updates.

Headlines are a mix of "Wow, Tesla succeeded despite the pandemic year!" and "Wow, Tesla put in all that work and still came up short of Elon's goal!" so god only knows. Crushed street expectations but missed the 500k by a rounding error's worth of vehicles.

I'm preparing myself for a drop to $670 on Monday but I also wouldn't be surprised if the weekend of processing time spikes it to $800 by Tuesday, moving towards $900 by EOW.

Wow this is really informative but not for the reasons you think. In 2020 they were projecting (and therefore pricing) 500k cars. That means the 2014 price would have reflected this value. That means the 2014 price would be the expectation of 500k cars in 2020 discounted for the possibility of failure. Even at a 50% discount the shares now are still way overvalued.

If you are talking about the interior of the store or how it looks then you are correct but that's not what I'm talking about.

Gamestop started closing stores in 2019. Ramped it up last year after the partnership with MS was finalized and made public. So they are already in partnership and it's easy for Microsoft to tell them to stop being pushy car salesman and they implement that across their stores. That's a policy decision and some emails to make it happen. No cost or infrastructure in store needed.

As far as implementing anything inside the store that would be stupid at this point. Microsoft makes most their money off of brand recognition and you can bet that they are going to overhaul the look of GameStop but not until enough stores are closed. At this point for them to only change the stores they plan on keeping open while keeping the stores they want to close looking the old way would be counterproductive to them trying to relaunch the GameStop brand.

Revenue did decrease, but you realize there's more financials metrics than revenue/profit right?

They have less debt, way more cash on hand, and they're actually in a solid financial position despite the pandemic. That's alone makes it different from Blockbuster, but I guess some people only look at the surface level stuff.

Maybe. But he's made a killing on GME I'm pretty sure that might put him in the green overall. Where as Johnson is STILL short Tesla. 

Personally I think because the contracts that would otherwise cause a squeeze, are being used to leverage regular payments from him, imagine owning tesla shares on paper and getting regular pseudo dividends from a short seller. 

That or the amount of money he'd need to take out in loans to cover his position and close would bankrupt him. So this is the best life he could still live.

How do you overcome the psychological barrier of buying a stock which has risen massively in a short period of time, even if you know in the future the price will go higher?

For example Square, I'm as certain as I've ever been about a stock going higher in the future but I just can't bring myself to buy it after it's risen ~600% since the March crash.

I missed out on such an incredible deal it feels scandalous to pay $220+ for it now when it was on sale for $70 - $40 just 10 months ago.

But the common sense part of my brain believes it's going higher anyway so just buy it now fuck it. Then the emotional side of my brain tries to tell me to wait for the price to drop back to $190 or so, that way I can at least get some what of a sale...
Perfect.

People are forgetting that the Legacy automakers also have laggy infotainment systems and other issues that make their cars not that great to live with on a daily basis.

 It's just that whenever Tesla does something it's newsworthy and if Ford or GM did the same exact thing no one would care. 

Of course they want the focus to be on panel gaps since they do that marginally better. But the driving experience is more important than whether her eblows are slightly too pointy and on that front it's no fucking contest.

Welcome to the club fam
I can trivially think of three semi legit business models for GS going forward.

They could try to exterminate the friendly local gaming store.  Imagine corporate "friday night Magic:the gathering" at every gamestop in the country with plenty of cardboard physical inventory games to sell alongside.  I would like a fast food level of standardization of FLGS food service for game nights, I'm not asking for gourmet but some FLGS nearly approach dive bar levels of food, like they own a dirty microwave and everything, while other FLGS you're lucky to have stale pop tarts and warm diet coke.  Also you could buy legacy GS stuff there like video game controllers and tee shirts for games nobody plays anymore.  You can buy Catan-shite at any Target or Walmart in the country but if you need a fix of Kingdomino you could hit one of thousands of remodeled GS.

Also no sarcasm seriously I've heard GS is one of the few brick and mortar corporate retailers who supposedly do, or did once upon a time, provide autism spectrum training to employees and they could leverage that into being kinda the ASD-friendly store in general, like a convenience store but friendlier.  Figet toys and weighted blankies and stuff like that.  Maybe a quiet room for ASD people having a meltdown, some homey couches or whatever.  I mean, lets be blunt, a lot of their clientele is on the spectrum may as well leverage that.  Make it a chill place to go on social skills class outings.  Chill ASD calm down videos on the store TVs, that kind of thing.  I mean, they have money to spend, and they already like to visit GS, so ...

At the this point the store is dying so trying to pivot into x-rated anime body pillows is not unreasonable anymore.  "Someone" is going to be the first nationwide pr0n sex toy shop may as well be GS.

Heck do all three strategies as the place to go for fun on Friday night, no matter if you want to play MTG while eating fast food standardized quality chikn tendies, need a new weighted blanket while watching chilled out Thomas the Tank engine DVD on the store's numerous TVs, or pick up a wider deeper dragon dildo along with anime body pillow, or any mix of the above.
I want to be rational and buy a M3 SR+ but wife is insisting on Y. Can imagine this happening to others too.

Yep, I didn't like any of the ones we met. Its a 120 year old house, it requires more than bottom of the barrel cheap replacements to hold it's value. We contrasted what the property managers offered vs what our real estate agents say will change the value of the house. We couldn't find anyone to get it done correctly with the capital that can be made from it. I'm in a weird spot with this place, unique by many measures. The main reason for the post was to figure out if I wanted to sell this winter vs peak summer.  Its seems like peak summer is best since my whole foreclosure tsunami idea is likely wrong. edit typos.

Yeah that’s fair but when you buy a stock, you’re buying into future expectations. I’ll likely buy a new car every 3-4 years, plus my wife as well, and if they turn me off from future purchases I’m probably not the only one. 

I’m not saying that I am not going to purchase one again, but I’m not exactly raving about my purchase either.

But seriously, tweet Elon this concern, I bet he's not aware.
Tesla delivered 500K cars. 

Biden is not best buddies with Winnie. The concentrated camps are going to push him to take a firmer stand. MBS ((Saudi) is wrapping up sentencing to dissidents. The president is not going to be a cuck to dictators like Donny has been.

Yeah they likely lease all of those stores. They r just saving money on leaases and employees. They r also mostly closing locations that are close to other locations.
That’s the strike I sold. I’ll roll it out another month if it’s looking like it’ll hit. If it runs this week for NIO day, it will likely cool off the following week before continuing back upward. I may just roll out to $80 strike March and just be content with $30k in profit if it hits.
I mean we just elected the oldest president. Sure there is a million ways of justifying this but that still doesn't change the fact that we keep electing people who are inches away from death. There were younger folks in the dem lineup but we had to pick grandpa biden. 

I would've preferred Pete Buttigieg but that's just me wanting a younger governing body.

Self-employed.  Most income from long term stocks and trading.  I highly recommend WSB degenerates that have sizable accounts for the first time this year, take cash out of your margin degenerate RH option account, and open a cash only, no options permissions, one elsewhere.  That way when you blow up RH for loss porn you are not finished as a trader.  As I commented elsewhere, I blew up my margin trading account in early March this year.

Always checking WSB while in the LONG ass line at SBUX...
I was just thinking about a time I was at Lambeau Field for a snowy December night game and i walked up to the deserted 400 level concourse to buy a hot dog and a beer, and the entire concessions staff was acting like they had down's syndrome.  The cashier acted like he couldn't understand my order.  He responded with that swollen tongue effect.  When he became agitated his supervisor came up and they spoke back and forth inaudible.

The supervisor turned to me and said in Down's, "we don't have hot chocolate!"  

I was like okay thanks, sorry to bother you.

I was so thrown off that it wasn't til years later I realized they were just bored stadium employees playing a joke on me.

Then call me crazy. The Obama and Clinton years outperformed the Bush Trump years. It’s weird to me you think people aren’t going to want to invest or make money during increased demand just because they would have to pay slightly more than record low rates. At one point this country had a 97% tax rate on the rich...and the economy boomed.

Casus belli 🙌
I think far OTM options contain information. They mean (at some point) people were/are overly optimistic or pessimistic about a stock. So if you ignore them or give them less weight, you take the information away. But I agree with your overall point esp for options that were generated long ago when the price was in a very different range. I'll think about ways to take this into account.
Thanks, I almost sold yesterday and I'm glad I didn't

Yup, basically any Japanese car from the mid 00's regardless of manufacturer, huge news at the time.

I drove around for months after receiving that recall notice from Mazda New Zealand, knowing that it could explode in my face, but not really expecting it to anytime soon.

It drove customers away. Good employees and managers who couldn't meet quotas as well. Microsoft seems to be straightening them out since that partnership went through.

Yeah I doubt it should impact the stock, if not for that very favorable analyst report on TSLA and its delivery numbers for 2020 and 2021 right before New Years that drove up the stock past $700.

I also think the China news is huge, mostly due to the news about pricing. But nowhere I can confirm that 100k pre order rumor. No reputable news sources reported or confirmed that

Liquid net worth increased by $373k in 2020.  Now at $561k compared to $188k this time last year.  58% cash, 42% securities.

I've got /r/fatFIRE aspirations and sometimes it's dispiriting seeing how far ahead the folks over there are.  But I can't look at the past year's performance and be mad.  

Sorry for the brag but there's no one else I can share this shit with.

All he needs to do is recall his shares (Like pharma bro did with KBIO) and a squeeze is on as shorts scramble to buy over 9 million shares, all shares are sold short, even the insiders.

I don't think doing that is a good idea, but the way the shorts are stretched like they are it's put them in a very dangerous position.
Me too
But definitely not a gay bear.
The real Elon musk?
As a shareholder, it's great that Tesla is cutting as many corners as they can and delivering cars that are barely meeting the quality bar for a luxury car. But as a driver, I could never buy a Tesla over an Audi or Mercedes, where the latter is just on another level in terms of quality.

# Palantir’s business model

## Palantir is not a “data broker” or “data aggregator.”

Unlike many tech companies, our business model is not based on the monetisation of personal data. We do not collect, store, or sell personal data. We don’t use personal data to train proprietary AI or machine learning models to share or resell to other customers. We never facilitate the movement of data between clients, except where those specific clients have entered into an agreement with each other.

Another non answer. I guess I’m just not poor enough to understand why someone would go buy a used video game, or why they would think gaming moving entirely digital would somehow still provide them that service, or why a company making money on used video game margins is worth investing in. I’ll continue to buy my games on steam, and my hardware on Best Buy or amazon. Good luck with your blockbuster pump and dump, I assume you aren’t one of the smart ones who will dump in time. also there isn’t a main post here it’s just a picture of a store retard, this isn’t one of the DD pump posts
Fraud and scammed people out of money, no respect.
Exactly. People don’t understand that. Tesla is gonna tank on Monday. Might be a chance to finally buy the dip.

Well that’s just plain Tarded!
Some posts and comments this week has gotten more money spent on them from reddit awards than what the government has given from their stimulus checks lol, madness
For those who own PLTR shares, how many shares do you have and what's your average? I tried to buy the dip but nobody told me it was a three layer dip :/
This is purely because musk himself is the fucking advertisement. You can’t go a day without reading a headline that says “Elon musk, the owner of the car company Tesla, has now opened a Wendy’s on Mars”

You don’t need to spend money on advertising when you yourself are an advertisement
RIOT Good, TSLA Good, GOEV bad, GME Good

If you have 5-10 minutes to read the DD I will upload tomorrow, it might be helpful to take some perspective and choose your own price target honestly but I think at least $30-35 is the bare minimum given the informations we have right now.
Why have I made more in Dogecoin in 3 weeks. I’m awful at calls.
FDs and other OTM short expiry contracts dont give a shit about fundamentals or value investing. Anyone long GME, like actually long, is retarded, but I think most people here are just looking for a quick buck or several thousand quick bucks and GME can definitely provide that.

It wasn't real. It was the former owner of the Sub's fake account, and they were 'verifying' the content to get more people to join the WSB sub so they could push/advertise a scam site (pay 3k for a video kind of thing) onto new subs. Thankfully the other Mods reported it to the reddit Administration, and the former owner got banned. The former owner is now treated like lord voldormort where no one wants to mention their name because of how scummy they were.

So this is how central banking works. Give gold and platinum to a small number of retards and then we give smaller awards to the rest of the sub. Everyone sees this and starts buying more fiat gold and the bull run continues. 

Fascinating how WSB is a microcosm of the global economy.
Trust mother Cathie
From what I see, every time people want to complain a lot about customer service and say that they're not going to buy the product if the customer service continues to stay bad, that products or business does perfectly fine.

If you give your money to someone and then say Oh but if you don't improve then next time I'm not going to give it to you, that never works.

Not saying it's not a valid complaint, but it's more valid if it prevents a purchase. If a person still purchase is knowing that customer service could potentially be an issue, I would say that's even more power to that brand

SQ, RIOT and TESLA are my Monday plays.
My 2 cents from an uneducated punter. Oil companies should be called energy companies. To think all they do is pump and move the black stuff is not true. Additionally, the world is poised to using energy as a whole on a much greater scale than ever. Yes, solar and wind is grabbing a larger piece of the energy pie, but the pie is growing as well. Total oil usage is actually going to increase even as the percentage goes down.  One of the best metrics to measure emerging nations is their use of energy. The quickest and fastest way is still oil. Will oil ever get replaced?  Yes, but not in my lifetime.  And it will be the oil (energy) companies who will (already have) diversity into other forms of energy production/distribution.
Amen

Absolutely! There’s a bit of a short float (40%) that has been holding this stock down at EOY. However, it’s completely derisked now and likely going to the moon. They still have 2 more FDA approvals coming before EOY 21. Further all their sister companies have been purchased by sumitovant. This is the only one left and sumitovant has approximately 60% ownership. It’s just a matter of time before they pull the trigger on a buyout. Safest and most lucrative play in my portfolio.

Man, just ventured outside of my normal channels on YouTube and i can't believe how dumb some of these stock pickers are. Absolutely cringe worthy, i can see why people think the top is in. 

That being said, anyone else watch ARMR? This guy fucks, been watching him for a few months and have actually learned a few things about how to use market indicators.
I’d like one of those awards with the 3 green jewels in the middle pls. Thanks Elon 😘

I also have a bunch of friends that have sworn off Teslas due to quality issues with their own. 

In any case, the financing I got was too good to pass up this time around. I’m not unsatisfied so far but I’m not a fanboy either.

OK SHIT TESLA NUMBERS JUST CAME OUT ...

oh oh gonna analize
If you are playing options and cannot hit $25,000 you probably shouldn't worry because that PDT is saving your ass seeing as you aren't that good at it anyway. Even being modest hitting $25k from $1k requires on average 16% per trade in 20 trading days. You can make 20% just trading options from .1 to .12 with great success without great risk with 45 \~ 60 days out on stocks with stable IV. Obviously the only way to be able to fail to do this is to not be able to trade successfully and to not be ballsy enough to actually YOLO and make some serious fucking money.

Serious: You shouldn't try day trading unless you can actually start off with at least 20% of the money upfront to bypass the PDT. Doubling thrice clears the rule.
Yes but it is about timing of the sale which leads you to believe that she knew delivery report will be bad and there will be a sell off. She could have sold those off this week if she had faith in tesla beating those #s

Back in my day, we used to call losing money in the markets “paying your tuition”. 

Then 2020 happened and we realised you would have to be absolutely batshit retarded to lose money in the market any more
They were awfully close.  Doubt this will affect the stock.  Also there is the leak about 100k MIC Model y orders.  That will more than offset any negative sentiment from barely missing a ridiculously high goal IMO

To all you idiots who keep claiming ARK is dumping TSLA, Cathie is required to limit TSLA to 10% of the fund, so she has to sell some when it's price appreciates.  Proof is their holdings as of Thursday:  https://ark-funds.com/arkk
All in on calls expiring 1/8,1 1/15 and 1/29 🚀 🚀 🚀
someone here has more reddit gold than regular gold
This man gets so much pussy

Wtf is this boomer shit?
This is true, it'll only move sideways as there is nothing to kick it.


However Cohen's cryptic tweet, holiday sales report, conference, are all things that could give it that kick.

Is $TSM ever going to dip or should I just fomo into LEAPs on Monday?
Just checked and we're clean out of everything else. Do you want any PLTR or GME?
More GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Well idk what to tell you it filled me at 32,500 and the price never cracked 32,400 on the minute I bought at. It’s at least $100 and probably more
It won't ever equalize because it's so ripe for speculation.

Thanks for the note Rob. I love what you do...I do read the notes. But as someone who doesn’t spend nearly as much time with these numbers as you, it’s hard for me to understand what were the big drivers that reduced it from $5 -> $2. I’d have to do a detailed line-by-line comparison of one of the older models to the new one. And the comments on the new one don’t explain it since I think they are only the change log from the last version which was like $2.10 down to this ones $2.00

Hope that makes sense
What did you bet on?
it’s a ‘currency’. i just use it as a savings account, no delusions about its application in the real world.
Clemson fuck you? Late nd touchdown I know fucked a lot of people

No idea how ppl use this as currency.  Buy something for $100.  Hour later you realize you actually spent $150.
Hard agree on it already starting to be priced in.  This stock got dumped hard very quickly and it had very little to do with retail sentiment.  I think people fear its going to drop like to $3 or something as all their employees dump their shares.  In reality, I expect something like a 10% drop from a pump as the institutions attempt to pick up their shares from their massive self made sell off.

Ignoring the atheists that chose to believe WSBGod is a fake, it’s fairly interesting to follow his positions. 

Much more interesting than unusual whale alerts.

If he is a fake, at least he had the decency to show his vanguard position of a $569k loss on a $25 PUT against royal Carribean expiring 18 September 2020. Even a WSBGod can be a True retard.

Dividends work if you have a steady stock that splits regularly and you hold it forever. $KO might be the best one out there. They split like every few years and they pay dividends. If you had 100 shares in 1980 and used DRIP you would have like 10,000 shares now.

So I’m going to post this here, as I’ve seen you posting a lot in advocacy of $GME. But you seem to be lacking a few critical points here and there in your arguments, especially in this post. I don’t have a vested interest in $GME, but you point here, “your comment works both ways” is wrong. Though you do acknowledge that $GME has a lot of work to do, you’re giving them something they don’t have:

A competitive advantage.

A competitive advantage is something that distinguishes your company from the others in the market as you. Well then I can name all the competitive advantages of the stores listed, but I can’t list a competitive advantage for $GME. Walmart allows parents to be able to purchase a game for their children while shopping for everyday necessities. Amazon allows the ease of shopping from home. Best Buy is not just games but everything technology related, leading to maybe preferring going there over GME (tbh, I think Best Buy is a failing business as well). But what’s is $GME’s competitive advantage? What does GME focus on over their competition that makes them stand out. That’s what you need to be asking, and until THEY provide an answer for that, I would be skeptical.
Maybe it's foreshadowing of something else
For full transparency I own the option below. But I’ll still buy the 10k in Monday if this wins and just keep the People’s Portfolio separated from my regular holdings. I bought to hedge some of my other holdings against early year profit takers.

One key point of this and all GME dd’s need to make is this: as long as the shares shorted are greater than the float, ie more shares exist on paper than in the real world. BUY THE FUCKING DIP. You see GME have a red day? Buy shares. 1% 5% or 10% down? Buy shares. Literally check your brokerage once a day. If GME is green hold, if GME is red buy some shares, BUT DO NOT USE ALL YOUR CAPITAL AT ONCE. Buy like 10 shares or 100 or 1000 depends how poor you are. Get margin, buy the dip, buy shares, but a little. As long as more shares are short than are available and you keep buying those dips we will literally all make money.

I didn't say we're never going to experience a cool off. I said it is highly unlikely we go back to "normal levels", by which I've assumed you are talking about 2016-2017 levels with Tesla at 180 and AMD at $9.

  


Because to go back to that "normal", you would need a 40% drop in sp500, which is on par with the Great Financial crisis.

  


To put that in perspective, think about how unprecedentedly awful the covid crash was - and ultimately it was "only" 30%. And covid was by all circumstances a 1 in 100 year black swan event, multiplied by China trade tensions and American election uncertainty. All that and it was -30% only. 

  


To hit GFC levels of a crash, you would also need the fed to never re-consider more QE. You would need millions of investors to suddenly not want to invest. You would need all banking regulations specifically put in place since the GFC to prevent another financial meltdown, to fail. In other words, you would need a WW3 global event. And that is already what covid actually is (literally a **global pandemic**). 

  


Point is: what is the chance of this "cooling off" being anymore than a regular -10% correction? If so, why wouldn't you just stay invested in solid stocks (FAGMAN for example) anyway and you're probably going to be up way more than 10% in the coming 1-2 years?

  


>Even most people in the industry say prices are overvalued.

  


Most people in the (finance) industry are fucking clueless as anyone else. They were shitting on both Tesla and AMD during those years and pushing fossil fuel boomer stocks as "dividend aristocrats". I would sooner bet on WSB meme stocks than on Wall Street analysts who only know how to run DCF models based on recurring cash flows. They all have no actual industry or business knowledge and have been proven wrong again and again.

  


Finally, let's be real. When some other black swan/disaster event happens in 2021 onwards, if you weren't the type to jump in march 2020, you're not gonna jump in on the next bloodbath because you'll probably come up with a reason why the sky will fall further.

  


Btw I'm not being rude/personal, just seeing the same wordings from many friends who have been giving 1001 reasons why there's "going to be a market retracement". 5/10/15 years later, they haven't done a single investment because there is ALWAYS something to fear on the horizon.

  


For some fun reading, [here's a list of every major reason not to invest since the 1970s, and what your returns would've been regardless. happy reading!](https://www.hartfordfunds.com/practice-management/client-conversations/there-are-always-reasons-not-to-invest.html?utm_source=basisdsp&utm_medium=display&utm_campaign=market_perspectives&utm_content=ReasonsNotToInvest)

Almost got caught watching porn. Just finished a wank and quit out of the video to play some music(I like to listen to tunes in the shower). The music stops 30 seconds in. Confused, I realized my mom just started the car and my phone auto connected to the Bluetooth inside it. I was 30 seconds away from her hearing some fucked up shit on full blast lol
Holy fuck giving awards is getting cringe please save your money this is retarded. Reddit loathes us and we give them money for phoney gold.
Switch to puff bars was less fuckin annoying when you lose it
Smart dad.
Also means hyper inflation decreasing the value of the dollar so who knows. Which that isn’t a democrat thing necessarily, republicans love printing too.
Everything points towards them not focussing on technology where they lag behind Tesla/Xpeng and instead investing in brand + establishing in Europe beginning with Nio House // Oslo.

They've cutback engineers with layoffs from their self drive team.

[https://technode.com/2020/08/17/nio-names-new-head-of-self-driving-unit/](https://technode.com/2020/08/17/nio-names-new-head-of-self-driving-unit/)

I hope to see their 150kwh battery on Nio day. Baas is their differentiator. 

It seems like they're pushing quite a traditional vision of the car (both in looks and function) and appealing to luxury owners + long term ownership with baas versus leading in the front foot of technology.

I don't have my head up elon's ass. I don't touch tesla because 1. I think it's overvalued and overdue for a correction and 2. It's just too volatile for me. 

But that doesn't change the fact that years ago tons of people doubted tesla would be a good investment, and obviously those people turned out to be absolutely incorrect. I'm not trying to debate tesla's fundamentals or justify their valuation; just stating that folks that bought tesla hit the fucking jackpot and that there will always be naysayers in meme stocks. 

I'm not sure where you're getting that tesla is up 65% though? 6 months ago is July 1st, tesla shares were ~$200/ea; today tesla shares are ~700/ea. (700-200)/200 = 2.5. Which means tesla is up 250% since July 1st.

My sister in law wanted to get in on the squeezening. I helped her buy some shares, and shes flipping out daily over the swings wanting to sell. I told her she's only allowed to look at the stock after the markets close and to be on standby for my phone call to start selling.

Take your shares and sell covered calls, lower your cost basis and stop staring at the stock like its Netflix! 

TLDR; WSB and GME is not for the paper handed. If you can't overcome the anxiety of Intraday losses, sell your shares to someone that'll hold them!

But the Democrats are now being run by spoiled brats who want free everything... I don’t care about politics at all, but anyone voting for more government control is a fucking moron. Since when has giving a ruling authority more control been successful? My view is simply get the fuck out of our way. The fact that I have to buy a permit and have an inspector approve me building a porch rail is what’s wrong in this country.

These downvotes by government boot lickers is hilarious. Saying I don’t want government controlling me is downvote-worthy? Damn!! Y’all some bootlicking retards in here with your nose up the Democrats’ ass.

Research involves a very complicated process of reviewing WSB DDs and (more often Memes). As you read through the posts, you have to skip to the bottom and look for the TLDR. If there are a lot of 🚀🚀🚀, you read on. You read through all of the comments, and if a lot of people say things like “I’m in!” Or “to the moon” or you see lots of 🚀🚀🚀, you go to your brokerage account and start frantically buying as many different varieties of options as you can buy (because you’re afraid if you don’t act fast enough it will moon before you secure your positions). Then you sit back and watch your money dissolve. 

Cheers and happy new year!

Its a paradigm shift away from the useless dollar
A company currently valued at $50+ billion, with a history of less than 150m revenues on average, and no prior history of getting a product of theirs past FDA is *undervalued*?

The vaccine may be better than Pfizer's, it may even be bought more by the world than Pfizer... but this is a single product, and one that has no long-term play. Pfizer has 10  drugs that make more than $900m in sales every year, 8 of which make more than $1b in sales and the company is valued at $200b.

To justify its $50b market cap, Moderna would have to sell upwards of $5b worth of vaccines for the forseeable future. 

My personal advice, ride the way until the wave starts crashing. Then you don't wanna be anywhere near it... that means bag holding won't get you anywhere but deep in a hole.

Netflix doesn’t ship out DVD’s anymore. They changed and became a streaming platform.

Amazon isn’t just a bookstore anymore. They sell almost anything you could want now.

Where does GameStop go? Consoles are now selling games direct to consumer. Their whole business model was based on games being limited to physical discs. They have no exclusive rights to sell console hardware, nor do they have the most competitive prices. 
GameStop won’t survive the decade, if even that.

RH is actually really nice for options. No fees ends up being pretty big if you trade a bunch. Plus you get the pleasure of watching that profit graph go parabolic...can’t get that anywhere else afaik

What do you think?
I don’t own GME shares because I value my money, and I have no clue what their long term plan is, but if I were them two ideas would be.

1. Focus on lower income communities where people can’t just always run out and buy a brand new $60.00 game or $500.00 console but could buy a used $15.00 game that came out a year ago or a used console for 75% the original price, I’d imagine that’s where their best margins come from anyway. They would have to also own their own real estate to save on costs and have them as assets (no more renting from dying malls and shopping plazas) 

2. This is a longer shot and way more resources, but create their own digital market place to compete with Valve (Steam) as an online marketplace for direct digital downloads. Game distribution was always their bread and butter, and their name is synonymous with millennials as the place to grab your game, so it might work if they do it right.
I dunno I kinda like blinding lights.

7th Edition foils will never be reprinted and they’re particularly nice. Old bordered, foil cards that have any chance of being playable have become very collectible.

7th Ed was also the only edition that used that particular foiling so they’re exceedingly rare. Even old dumb creatures no one will ever play from that set, in foil, are seeing a large bump in pricing due solely to collectibility.

Also take a look at Odyssey foils, may be the new batch of collectible oddities. Plenty of untapped (ha!) potential there.

I’ll probably get downvoted to hell for this, but this reminds me of Sears.
A lot of opportunity to transition to WHAT? Using vague terms like “the expanding gaming space” and “e-commerce” can be said about every company involved in that part of the retail industry.

If anything It sounds like you are the one making the emotional argument. “People will still want to buy physical discs at the store”. Same argument was made for RadioShack and Blockbuster, look at where they are now. GameStop literally needs to transform from retail into tech or some other market. Thinking that Cohen will come down from the heavens and make that giant warp singlehanded is ridiculous.

My dad's a retired CPA and he's been in TQQQ for most of this bull market. He's slowly moved out and now only has ~400k in as of March, but was able to make off really well just in this last year. Even if the market crashes, his cost basis is super low.

I'm planning on getting into TQQ, UGL, NUGT, JNUG, in the next 6-12 months, although the double funds are not as resilient for the long term. ER is important to check and use an online calculator to make sure it will still do just as well as the unleveraged fund.

Not the individual, but the collective. But mostly to secure western dominance versus China. This is about geopolitics. Something Silicon Valley doesn’t give two shits about. Just a bunch of Generation Y looking to get rich quick.

They see China as the enemy and does not engage in business with that country. And will not. Pretty extraordinary since doing business with China is every company’s  wet dream because of their booming middle class.

The 3,000 limit was set in 1978. I don’t know how exact the online inflation calculator that I used was, but it shows over 14,000 as the current inflation adjusted value of 3,000 from 1978. IRS should make it at least 10,000

I just wanted to make a correction.

&#x200B;

In some areas currently GME seems to have made a deal with I believe doordash? (correct me if im wrong) which is now completing same day delivery (which walmart and best buy most definitely don't do).

&#x200B;

They have also started attaching exclusive GME merch to specific orders (I think the most common was cyberpunk so far?)

&#x200B;

They are now hiring for positions to help and adapt to a e-commerece platform.

&#x200B;

Ryan Cohen which while they were different companies seems to think they could lead the company in a positive direction and has upped his stake to 12.9% (to add on to this, he was offered a seat at the board and declined it). I would only imagine he would do so because hes aiming higher (could be wrong who knows).

&#x200B;

Currently the stock is shorted by something like 68-70m shares? (maybe this has changed).

&#x200B;

The ICR has been changed to Technology from what it previously was which could be very good if this means they are getting into selling more electronics (computers,laptops etc).

&#x200B;

Now lets look at the bad side, lets say this crashes and dies. Current share price would drop to maybe 10-12 (which is valued from the cash they have at hand).

&#x200B;

So the potential is massive; while the drop would hurt. I wouldn't be crushed.

I agree. Generating options against shares isn't the same thing as buying options because MOON.
Only if you count retroactive dips for example right now it is dipping several percent below the base level of 24 hours from now

Really it's in one big nonstop dip, it's just that the dip is oriented in reverse going down as you go back in time so you perceive it as a spike because your human mind can only perceive time happening forwards
VTSAX 🤡 and ARKK/ARKG.
They can ban it but can’t enforce it. People can buy from peer to peer exchanges and store it. If they do that they will lose capital gain taxes and lot of other American companies going out of business. They have much to lose by banning than gaining.

If Moderna's vaccine causes side effects *and* can't deal with the new mutation, though, it's curtains.

wall st bulls were calling for 190-200+. 180 which barely misses 500 target is not good enough. This is a miss and with a stock that has run up the way tesla has....monday cannot be good. 

People will learn to understand that when a stock roars higher, it doesn't have room to just meet, let alone miss like this. With that being said, tesla is a full retard stock so who knows what'll happen, but I think there is a strong chance, especially considering new years tax reasons that this can fall off a cliff monday

Teslanaires did that pre split. They'll do it again post split.  1T market cap isn't far-fetched. It's a matter of when it hits $1000. My guess is end of 2021 since TSLA will probably scale up to 700-800K deliveries in 2021.

Good for them. The problem is, they usually grow up to not give a shit about others, and have a lot of bias and prejudice that results from living literally in their own sheltered ecosystem.

Good points. I agree mostly with that you’re saying. One thing I don’t agree on is that Nio will won’t be able to break into the western market. I do believe it will be tough and that most people won’t want to buy them simply because they are Chinese but if Nio continues to put out quality cars and at a competitive price I think people will have no choice but to consider them as an option. Also whether we like it or not China is increasingly looking like they are going to be the super power of the world. Right now their economy is booming for all working classes and people are happy in China right now. In turn this will lead to more spending and the trickle down effect begins. I wish I had more tsla but I believe Nio has more upside in the next couple years which I why I’m heavily invested in them. I think both will do great things.

There's a website where you can own "shares" of valuable collectibles and as the value fluctuates so does the value of your shares.

Idk why you wouldn't just buy your own valuable collectibles at that point but yeah, it exists.

There is more than one business model.  

Technology is what will differentiate NIO from the rest.  Focus on research first then you can build your factory.
Drag races are driver dependent, unless you have the same driver hopping in and out of the cars to see what their performance on each vehicle is.  Taycan is 0-60 in 2.4-2.6, Tesla does it in 2.2-2.4.  Taycan range is under 300, Tesla is 350-500 depending on model.  Tesla is $140, Taycan is over 180.

Then you have to figure states of battery, and whether both batteries were warmed up.  Cheetah or older model?  Launch mode enabled?  

Nurburgring time trials Tesla destroyed the Taycan as well as beating the Lucid Air.

It takes a lot of luck to time exactly the market so in my opinion, I think splitting your investment in two or three (depending on your capital) is best: One asap + one or two other when it dips at least -5% or -10% from your first position.

$375m worth of shares are being bought back over a period to feb 27 but we don’t know at what price. So I took a very high number, to error on the side of caution of $25/share. It will obviously be much lower than this but still makes the same point. If average stock price of their accumulation is $20 then that’s about 18.5m shares.
Some Turkish guy in New York sold me one for like 15$.  Deal of the century.
imagine telling someone that an exercise bike company would be worth 40 billion dollars 10 years ago. Yoga pants (LULU) also valued at 40 billion. We've literally didn't need these companies. between rusty ass excercise bikes you find at yard sales, and $5 p.e. uniforms, we had this covered.

Honestly I would give it at least 3 days on top of what you think it needs to reach a certain PT. For instance if you think it'll be 245 eow, buy a 245 call for the end of the month. If you're right your call will moon either way and you have a way bigger margin of safety. Yes it costs more, but I think you'll find that will help you much more in the long run of trading. You also have more chances to close positions at reasonable stop losses, good luck man.

I’ve been collecting 7th edition Magic: The Gathering foils. Watch for “buyouts” or card with potential to buyout. New sets can trigger this as people look for old cards to fill out the new mechanic in their deck or sometimes an investor will find something at .10 or 1.00 and buy every store out then re-list them on the secondary market for $100’s.

I grabbed a couple copies of foil 7th *Sisay’s Ring* for pennies on the dollar, they’re all worth $70 - $80 last I checked.

Thanks for the links. The first one is a link to the JD Power survey, which has a questionable rating system. One good video that discussed this was https://youtu.be/EuG8mgdnshY

The second link references the first. The third one seems to make a valid point. But I’m not sure I could correlate this with an increasing problem with build quality over time. Not denying there are issues, but I think they are often blown out of proportion.
Most car companies have billions and billions in debt relative to their cash holdings.  Tesla could have 0 debt if they chose to, and still have enough cash on hand to build yet another giga factory.

It’s one of the most important concepts for business in general and especially for tech businesses, as it’s the key dynamic behind many successful software-based companies. Understanding network effects not only helps build better products, but it helps build moats and protect software companies against competitors’ eating away at their margins.

Simply put a network effect is when a product or service becomes more valuable to users the more people use it.

It's just a data analysis platform like think or swim, but instead of stocks you analyze people places and things. That being said their UI looks shitty and not mobile friendly at all. 
They do have other tech too in the dev ops space for continuous delivery, which basically means updating the software remotely without you, the user, needing to do stuff .

>Basically as it turns out, **current tech for solar and wind sucks big time**, and it probably will for decades to come. 

Technology continuously accelerates. Windmills have existed for thousands of years and yet within the last two hundred have done more than they did for the first thousands. I don't think that you can shirk off the progress by substitution of another product and declare that this product is "safe". For instance XOM had a massive run-up through the early 2000's culminating in 2007 but that became it's "top" bracket; it would never escape that particular state corrected for all manners of events. 

This matters. It means that even though we know the top we also saw XOM very, very slowly slide for the last 5 or 6 years from that top. Just slowly. It was 1\~2% per year before finally falling out. The bull case for XOM and oil in general is complex because you have two functions to concern yourself with; the first is that we need the oil *actually dug up* which we have enough oil to last those decades without getting another drop and the second is that our reliance on oil, because we have enough as is, will be maintained and that is clearly not the case. 

As a species we started exiting oil 40 years ago. I'm not saying that it is not pertinent today but the idea that this is a strong proposition doesn't seem rational to me. If there is no *increased* reliance you don't have a bull case. You might have a case for a stagnation but that's about it. Oil will probably recover a little bit but I don't see XOM going right back to 80 or 90 and sitting there. It just is not going to happen.

The only voter fraud I've seen is suppression via dismantling USPS. If you have actual proof of voter fraud, you might want to take that to the courts and help Trump. The president and his boys in the FBI can't seem to find evidence.

Probably why no court will take him seriously, but either way, Dems don't need to commit fraud. They just need to get their people to actually vote and they win. Hence why Reps play the suppression game.

Not really true they need to be a gigantic car maker in the future for their current valuation. For their current valuation they need to be a giant car maker, a giant long haul truck manufacturer, a giant battery maker, a giant solar roof installer, store energy for a lot of utilities around the world in giant battery farms, become a giant global autonomous taxi service, AND become an auto insurance company.

They pull all this off and valuation will be quite reasonable and maybe even allow a bit of valuation growth.

Honestly IMO? Probably a part of it. It toke like 2-3 months of bag holding for actual in-depth DDs to pop up. Plus other plays have popped up, and some will naturally sell for a loss in hopes the next 10x they see. There’s also end of the year slumps (book balancing/taxes), holiday liquidations, and a general lack of news as people are home For family. 

Not against pltr. I think it’s a long hold, but you gotta be able to tell the story including why it dipped hard, and then harder. Lock-up ending I imagen will be a shit show for my current shares, but a great time to add some friends

It isn't sustainable. Some caution and care of someone with a brain who connects the dots. I might add that I find it hard to believe a global pandemic with lockdown is just forgotten in the stock markets. Many small businesses shattered, survivors with to sky high debt,  some earnings numbers must and will look horrible. Even the big Internet winners have a customer base in the affected parts of economy. Earnings and revenues have to fail at some point. Bankruptcies could dent this glory we see now. Maybe it doesn't even need a trigger event just starts crumbling.

This whole situation with Cohen reminds me of Sumner Redstone and Midway. In 2006, midway was done. They had little of value other than old IP and kept making bad investment decisions. No great dev teams, no great publishing op, just no way to grow. IIRC Redstone thought he could buy it on the cheap and get someone to fix it. Rumor was he also saw possible media synergies with Viacom as a possible vertical integration, which makes no sense to anyone except people in media who don’t understand video games. It’s not that the strategy is bad, it’s just you need to do it with a better game company. This reminds me a lot of what’s going on with GME and Cohen.

Anyway, two things happened:
1) Midway stock rose from the dead in the face of Redstone’s relentless buying. Redstone bought 87%. He also bought 70m of their debt. 
2) Once Redstone lost interest in buying and extending lines of credit it went to 0 and fast, and he dumped his stake on some dude for 100k. 

I think gme is in less of a dire situation because they have good cash flows and management is being prudent. But it’s very similar in that they lack growth opportunities and are more of a cash cow. As such, the play is:
1) while Cohen accumulates, buy or stay the hell out of the way. Shorting just gets you squeezed. 
2) once Cohen is done accumulating or runs out of funds to accumulate, get out and/or short unless you think he’s going to take it private. I think taking private is hard because hed need institutional investors to like his plan and he can’t really afford the entire company, but maybe he can find believers. But either way, probably get out, and if you short at that point, use puts targeting a collapse a year or two out, don’t do it direct.

Yeah the data is out there. It wouldn’t surprise me if palantir eventually start offering a generic data spout as well. Build a centralized data lake and sell access to different data streams tailored to fit into their ecosystem. Obvious way to keep customer investment high and upsell more services.

Fuck it I’m betting on this being the case eventually and if they reveal that the stock is gonna blow up even more. Think I might double down like a true autist

The best way I can say it that you being forced to sell at $23 is only beneficial to you. You can always buy in at 25 the next day if you think it still has more upside. The squeeze won't be over in a day or 2. The squeeze will be over 2 weeks too 2 months.

I have worked in mortgage for 10 years. I currently work in master servicing repackaging mortgage backed securities. We started adding covid specific data to our data tapes for deferrals at the beginning of 2020. I saw covid deferral agreements from many servicers around the same time. 

Yeah there are a lot of covid deferrals happening, but deferrals have a low chance to turn into delinquent or REO...as far as we have seen from covid and prior deferrals of the same type (think katrina, wild fires, etc) A lot of these are really 0 interest loans due at maturity taken against your principal. Most deferrals will accrue 0 interest until the loan is paid off. Most loans will be refinanced or paid before maturtity. The real impact is on the investor's/ (GSE) bottom line from missed interest, if any. On deals that are scheduled/scheduled, the missed interest is usually advanced from the servicer to the trust until the loan liquidates, loan transfers, or trust collapses. 

If you look at revenue for non-bank mortgage servicers over the last year, they have done great. GSEs are too big to fail from the missed interest. So no, i don't think the covid crisis will cause a dip in the immediate future
The question for Tesla is whether it's "priced in" already. It seems like the "priced in" shit only happens with stocks I own.

One might agree that the build quality is not as good as it used to be. Nevertheless, besides its unmatched big screen in the center console, Tesla has nothing to beat a Car from the VW group. I think the new Porsche Taycan really showed it off what they are able to do. The technology Transition to the lower priced Audi e-tron GT (which aims at the Tesla price category) in my mind really will be a blast!
If you yolo the 10K on GME call  you could turn it into 500K, and if you lose it all just try again in 9 months.. infinite money hack..
Honestly over the second half of 2020 it started to get serious institutional adoption as a store of value. It might pull back short term but I do think it might actually have it's utility.

Your puts are fucked, no way it will dip for being a hair short. Even if it does it will get bought up by EOD
Of course. They’re always worth at least the current share price minus your strike price. If the stock goes up, the value of your call will go up by an even greater percentage.

Update on the couch situation. We're leaning toward an antique / Victorian couch and some wingbacks for the sitting room 😎. We're moving into a turn of the century house, so we're gonna get real basic bitch with it and go antiquing for shit today. Our current place is more modern/boho, but our furniture won't really work in the common spaces in the new house. Is there a fucking couch company I can invest in? That shit has to be a money maker.

I was reading a dd last night where everyone was shitting on Nio saying they won’t thrive due to tsla being tsla. My point is that just because tsla is great doesn’t mean that Nio can’t also be great. I believe both companies will continue to grow. As crazy as this sounds I also believe that people are sleeping on the potential that Nio has. It is more than a meme stock that when from single digits to where we are now. This shit has no ceiling once people start to realize the quality cars they are putting on the market and once they expand outside of China

The issues with solar and wind are efficiency and handling power when the sun goes down or wind dies down. Efficiency is actually high enough that solar has grown significantly and both individuals and power companies can switch large portions of their energy to solar/wind. Efficiency is constantly growing whereas efficiency of oil systems are, well, about where they can be unless some big breakthrough is made.

The second issue is fixed by batteries. Now, batteries are expensive and don't last forever, but there are quite a few companies trying to sold those issues and not just for solar/wind power systems.

At some point oil will run out, our govt needs to focus on actual long term which would be wind, which will never go away, and the sun, which will virtually not go away. If we keep relying on oil, China is going to surpass us technologically as we grasp at oil-covered straws.

Oil long until you see next big solar breakthrough/news, or long solar. Your childrens' children will die before the sun turns off.

I'm new to the GME train. Looking at the max chart, the stock did a long, slow slide over the course of years and years, and then suddenly started to perk up again last August. Why was that?
Is the learning curve for D3 difficult? Seems pretty useful for all sorts of data visualization but it seems pretty complex
Might dump a little, but it’s not like everyone stops working. Also the key people aren’t cashing out. They have all the money they need. Power is what matters to them. If it dumps I’m ready to buy more stocks.
http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=IRS+tax+tables+2020
Becuase there is no new news out that gives the stock any reason to squeeze. The gme squeeze isn't going to be hard and fast, the people with the deepest shorts gave the most money and won't be required to cover instantly via share buying.

I belive in the squeeze. But it won't be insanely fast.

Regardless. Say you sell 1400 calls at $23 expiring the 8th. That is somewhere around $30k you get. Now let's say somehow gme hits $25 this week, unlikely as fuck.
That means you end up selling 140k shares at $23 for 3.2mill instead of making 3.5mill from selling at $25.

If it's doesn't hit $23 and it stays around $19, that means you pocket 30k to buy another 1000 shares or so. That's 10 more calls you can sell.


Puts are also the other side. Sell $18 puts for 117k. If it goes below 18 you sell 140k at 18.

It's all based on how you wanna do it, but you 100% need to be selling options on a weekly basis.

What does the brand add to PlayStation, Nintendo or Xbox that is preventing those brands from reaching their maximum market? Is it worth giving up some of the 30% they charge everyone?

They deal with data integration. If your company uses multiple systems for storing data (finance, shipping, manufacturing, test systems, complaints, etc), one of the main challenges is to be able to export the data from all the systems and combining them to give a cohesive 
View of the organization. Palantir’s product suite allows you to do just that

It is. Biggest wealth transfer in the history is happening with b  🪙
Well, to the money part first, my family has slowly accumulated generational wealth via having increasingly successful children. The waste of money take is actually a pretty juvenile if you are capable of thinking bigger than the cost of diapers and consider things like jointly held assets and business ventures. I’ve made my parents way more money than I ever cost them. But of course every family situation is different.

The life is over part just literally isn’t true. You don’t die when your child is born. In fact, people with children statistically *live longer*. But I know you didn’t mean it literally; you meant parents don’t get to do the things they want to do anymore. But, again, I’ve not seen that be the case for any parents I know. The presence of a child doesn’t stop anything from happening. Does it change some people’s perspectives about *what they want*? Sure. But then in that case they are still doing what they want, which is an equally full life.

I’m not vouching for you or anyone to have kids. It’s just that the common hot takes about how burdensome they are tend to be dramatic and wrong.

If you hold a stock for less than a year, you have to pay short term capital gains taxes, which is much higher than holding it for more than a year. 

So any profit you might make selling before the lock up ends will be subject to higher taxes, which might make it less profitable, or worse a loss, for you to buy back in.

I have $120k in Apple so I’m very long, but I worry that, with everyone sitting their ass at home, nobody cares about 5G speeds. They aren’t streaming Netflix at the local deli on their lunch break. They’re at home on wifi. 

Apple pushed my free year of Apple TV+ out to Feb, and they have zero new content right now. They need S2 of everything they had at launch for me to pay for it. 

The $20/mo Apple One gives me 200GB of storage. I pay $3/mo for that. My Spotify is $15/mo. That’s not convincing enough to make me drop my Spotify bc I have a ton of personalized stuff there. 

If I were already paying for all the services in the bundle, then sure, I’d use Apple One, but then Apple is now making less revenue. 

The real profit will come from offering a brand new phone with all of those services for like $70/mo instead of buying the phone for $900 and then hoping that that person signs up for Apple One on their own.  

And if Apple became their own wireless carrier?  Wooooo boy
I didn’t file, but made an estimated tax payment.  Can make estimated 2020 tax payments until January 15, 2021.  (https://www.irs.gov/payments/direct-pay) For degenerates like us it’s a good idea to prepay a sizable estimate before you file, because if you blow up your trading account before you file, then your trading account is at $0, AND you still owe the IRS for all your prior year gains.

Consider reality: The framework for what a good engineer is happens to be clear; those who forward whatever project to a meaningful extent are actually good.

The framework for what constitutes a good businessperson is opaque as mud. You can run a local business, the only one of it's kind in a small town, very, very poorly and still make money. In fact you can actually be the "best" in town. Because businesses are common, cheap, extremely proliferated, almost always scored relatively, and can fail or succeed regardless of the management thus prone to survival bias good business people are extremely common. They simply have to be.

Couches are only fucking expensive if you buy them new. Atleast where I live, they are sometimes *free* if you buy them used. They are heavy, people need to move but can't move them and sometimes give them up if you take care of their problem asap.

If you're willing to pay for a used one, you get some sweet deals as well. I'm sitting on some 19th century couch that looks fucking cool and was way less expensive than a new couch.
$30 calls are too cheap to be worth selling tho tbh.

Sell 500-1000 a this week at 23. If gme goes back to 20 sell 25s next week. If it hits 23, sell 30s. So on and so on.

However, as long as the call is above your share cost basis you have profited. Hell being forced to sell at 23 means you still made over 300k. If you think it is near squeezing do to good news then you just don't sell calls or buy back in.


The squeeze isn't going to happen in the next 2 months anyway.

Don’t agree at all. The myopic focus on taxes gives away that you don’t know what you’re talking about. Minor tax changes don’t drive markets, they just don’t. And if you’re going to say look what 2017 tax cuts did, you’re confusing correlation with causation. Every election, morons say Dems will tank the markets with tax increases, and every time they’re wrong. Markets perform better when the federal government is under Democratic control. Generally due to stronger, healthier economies.
Very strong moat, but aren't their products impossible to scale up quickly? Sounds like boomer-level growth.

So you think March is when we recover?
could still be corrected upwards by up to 0.5% according to tesla ( of ~180k Q4 numbers so up to about 900 cars )
The neutering of it is what makes it more appealing to institutions and governments.
I disagree, unless you have evidence to back up that claim? Build quility has been steadily increasing over time from Fremont over the last year from what I can tell. Shanghai has been consistently good from when it opened a year ago. 

Whenever there is the slightest issue with any Tesla it seems to get a lot of attention online, but I question that build quality is now any different to other manufacturers, that are not as closely watched as Tesla.

And it scales. The longer you do it, the more you can charge, and young kids especially these days can do it. First site I built for $1000 was at 15 and I was only born in 93. Alll the kids who grew up with coding apps and shit on their iPads can crush those numbers with a little effort. Anyone can, with Wordpress really. It’s annoying enough for regular business owners not to want to fuck with it, but large enough to be valued and allowed profit. Plus the ability to hand it over to another developer is so easy. 

Easy cash, part of my business model for the last ten years. Rotated to a different sector these days but I’ll still take the money if I get a call because I’m a  huge Jew

2. Centrists or those who are not affiliated would tend to vote Republican to avoid concentration of power with Democrats and maintenance of balance in three wings.

Tesla was founded in 2003. Volkswagen was founded in 1937. Give Tesla some time and they will be on a roll. Tesla is a baby company compared to the old guys. Just in 17 years they are doing half a mil cars, that is something. 

And you have to look at the cars they do, most of them are premium prices. Wait till 2023 when they release the 25k car, that will boost their numbers.
Good points but physical copies of games are going away just like DvDs/Blu-Rays are...o wait those never went away.

IB lite could be a good idea, if you have access to that. No inactivity fees, free stock trades. Margin rates are higher though.

It’s heavily overvalued right now. I believe 60% of its business are public sector, and those most of those contracts are up in the next 1-4 years, without certainty of renewal. 

That said, the good thing to note about public sector contracts...ESPECIALLY with high security ones, is that it’s REALLY hard to change your contractor...so PLTR should, realistically, keep all of those contracts no problem. 

They’re diversifying, and are actually a good bet for the future. Big data is the future.

Weekend doesn't have a hyphen you retard.
I've never played without auctions (or with added money), but it's effect is marginal as the only real strategy is to buy everything you land on, to the point where you morgage your existng properties for cash to buy more (except in very niche circumstances). Thus, everyone will be low on funds with a lot of random property that they have to trade. This portion of the game takes a long time. After that, it's a slow grind to the finish. Have you ever watched a monopoly competition? It takes forever, and everyone does the same stuff.

I'm not trying to say that. They will expand. They can still sell games while expanding their business. I think it makes a lot of sense.

Figure out how many calories you expend in a day. Then eat 500 more calories than that ( if you up the exercise, up the calories, to off balance). 500 x 7 =3500 or 1 lb a week. Do this for a couple weeks, if you haven’t gained anything you miscalculated somewhere,and adjust from there. Depends where you are at, are you a beginner lifter? If you are lifting properly (almost no one does) your first couple years will be great then it diminishes after that. If you are naturally skinny your progress can be half what an average persons is like 5 to ten pounds of muscle first year, average persons is 10 to 15. A lot of people’s views are skewed by what’s actually achievable with or without steroids. Genetics play a huge role. If you see someone over 220 and they are super shredded, it’s steroids, unless they are tall Or some crazy freak thats 1 in a billion.
If you don’t at least make a good faith effort to pay estimated amount owed then they can hit you with an interest penalty.  I probably owe ~15k more than this.  Will pay that when I file.

I said it has already rocketed. Up around 4-500% in the last 4 months. It can keep growing but it won’t at the same rate. GME isn’t a good company and a lot of their products are available digitally which is a huge competitor in this social distance time.

That was the the dumbest thing I’ve read this week. Basically your point is that reduced demand for oil is bullish because demand isn’t zero. Utterly retarded.
What the H would gamestop sell?  “Go Digital” What the H does that mean?  I don’t know consoles but NO - they cannot sell downloadable games cheaper than the console’s store - thats a closed eco-system and it is not realistic to think that is some major growth area. 

People cannot trade the ‘digital’ games either. 

That’s like me saying ‘I ‘purchased’ this copy of die hard movie on amazon instead of renting it and I can sell it to you at my next garage sale...’ does not work that way - their not tradable and you don’t really own them to start with.

Are they going to be ebay of game chotsky stuff - maybe - but why will anyone go there?  Are they going to ship it cheaper than anyone else?  No - are they going to beat steam at their game... no.

Chewy or whatever is because no one trusts amazon store sellers to not be selling poison to their dogs and the whole online experience is horrible for competing sites. Do the consoles have that problem?  Not really imo. 

Gamestop Brick and Mortar IS the entire play and there is a genuine need for the store and has some undervalued stock due to everything written about that. 

However I have not seen one elaberation on what ‘go digital’ means. I get that we would not know but think about why it cannot be ‘download games’ - so has to be something else and honestly... With the console app stores being closed walled off place... I am not seeing it.

Nothing happens. You just may not be able to buy or sell the securities for a period of time until President Clown leaves office. I hold one of these companies directly and likely several of them through various ETFs.

If you have shares, leave them in. They have earnings and an event coming in January iirc. Both should be positive catalysts and they've been teetering for awhile. They had two huge share purchases on Friday.

The undercutting is not working in drawing players as it’s to the publisher not to players. Publishers don’t want price cuts either. My point is far better equipped companies fail to beat steam who logically could be steam. People don’t want to switch. And everyone uses discord for their social platform. 

Guess who else dabbled in store and didn’t succeed? Discord

Competing on price is at worst going to just cause epic and steam to cut in response if there’s a threat. It’s a dead end.

You need to disrupt them. Except that’s what steam did to gme about 15 years ago. That’s when gme was supposed to do this rather than roll their eyes. Copying them now is not disrupting them. It’s losing.

Nah, same thing happened to us Xers in the late 90s. Actual Boomers, not the mislabeled kind you guys have, were telling us to stick with bonds and mutual funds and we were busy dumping our life savings into companies like Yahoo, Microsoft, SGI, Sun and laughing at people who thought a dying company called Apple was going to make a comeback.

In the end a lot of people thought the tech bubble would last forever and forgot to cash out. Lots of zoomers and millennials who forgot about 2008 will end up making the same mistake.
an actual boomer trying to learn something modern? what is this socery, ban for trying to keep up with the world.
Agreed, I was more speaking to the fact that you pointed out the issue that clients basically have to bring their own data to the table. The data that these companies capture can definitely be an issue, but with most there is no shortage there. They simply are ill equipped to handle it with intelligence. Again the ignorance here is staggering, I won't dispute that.

Tesla pretty much missed on vehicle deliveries by 450 when the expectation was that they would “handly beat expectations”

I like Tesla but I’m not fucking delusional.

Let me put it to you in terms you might understand.  If you match with someone on grindr, and you have a photo shopped cock pic that makes your dick look like it’s 12” but you say it’s 10” but in reality it’s only 8.75”.  It’s a fucking miss and your new anal bf is going to be very disappointed.

JCPenney tried that in 2011 when Ron Johnson came in. He wanted to gut the interiors of every store, replacing all of the perfume / jewelry sections with a Starbucks-esque kind of cafe thing, with the intent of JCPenneys everywhere becoming 'town halls' for every small town in America. He also got rid of coupons and lowered prices across the board. 

Turns out that gutting every store you own is costly, and no one wants to drive to JCPenney to drink coffee in the middle of a bunch of sweater turnstyles. Oh also his coupon idea failed because people are fucking retarded and like to feel like they're saving money even when they aren't. He was ousted in 2013.

If those retards didn't close when the price was as low as 4, they're not gonna close until their losses are like 200% lol. So fucking stupid.

What were they waiting for, like 1$? They already made so much and were correct, I find it so hard to believe they could be so right with a prediction and then never close. Aren't they meant to be professional and not fucking autistic retards like us?
No joke man. Sell 1000 01/08 $23 calls. Had you done that on the 31st, you'd have sold them for 50-36k. Then on the 8th, you sell 1000 01/15 $23 calls for 50k+ the call strike is where you'd be fine selling your shares.

Selling $23s means that even if gme pops and it's exercised, you still make over 300k in profit just from the calls being exercised.

The smart thing to do is buy the calls back once you've made like 50% of the profit. This is called theta gang.

You have enough money that selling calls/puts every week no matter what will earn you over 125k a month.


I know this sub is about being retarded, but you already have over 2mill, be smart and earn over 100k a month.


If you want to only sell 500 a week that let's you keep over 90k shares safe so when the squeeze does happen you will make absolute bank.

Regardless you should be selling calls and puts every damn week. Being rich means you do rich people shit to get richer, not degenerative gambling.
Dude TSLA has retard bull power. They will coast in 700 range for week. Sorry but money go bye bye

If you buy, you can excercise or sell it. The seller cannot excercise it.

Edit; misread this. If you sell it, you are not on the hook bc previously you had purchased one option, and now you have zero. The original seller is still on the hook if the person you sold it to excercises it.

Companies routinely partner up to cross reference customer lists. Salesforce works in the same fashiom, and I can tell you from the 20 seconds of GIFs available here that Palantir would destroy them if all of this is in one single location.

Further, I think it is awfully naive to assume that they would not be creating an index of public information to seed such a new low of business. Peter Thiel was the first Facebook investor, don't forget.

While I agree that many folks are ignorant here, business and governments have plenty of data they've amassed in the past 30 years since the advent and mass adoption of computers and the internet. Its a major problem in CS, the availability of data and inability to pull intelligence out of it. I have a background in CS and have worked as an analyst at fortune 500s and its scary how many of these companies rely on one person or a small group to generate all analysis on which their decisions are based. Like really scary/embarrassing. My biggest concern is simply the learning curve and run time it will take for those companies to become aware of the fact that they aren't using data properly or to its full potential.

5” is an admirable size
European oil companies I agree with because they are downsizing their oil and gas asset portfolios to focus on the most profitable areas and using profits to fund green energy at the same time. XOM and CVX not so much, I would avoid them - very concentrated on oil and gas with no meaningful green energy division. Even if they perform well financially the market will continue to undervalue them from a P/E ratio.

BP on the other hand is likely taking green energy too far without having differentiating technology or acquisitions. They are pumping money into developing green energy capabilities instead of acquiring this capability inorganically like their counterparts. Meanwhile, they are so down on oil and gas that they have stopped exploring and are foregoing profitable and competitive capital expenditure in oil and gas.

If you want to invest in oil long, go in on RDS and TOT. They both have very competitive asset bases, they are going into green energy slowly and focusing on entry into competitive areas and where they don’t have a competitive advantage they are focusing on inorganic acquisitions which is a better way to grow than what BP is doing. They have also navigated the downturn better than competitors from a CFFO delivery and capital expenditure management standpoint.

Source: I work for one of these companies and work directly with 3 of the others mentioned and have contacts within the others.

You can’t say what will happen, that’s the problem with probability’s.

Equal weighted basket of GME, PLTR, TSLA and ARKG.....can’t go tits up
Thanks for this, interesting read. I like that he at least is honest about the parts he’s speculating on. Very logical that a buyout will come if gilead stays flat and undervalued. I mean why wouldn’t roche just issue more shares while they’re near all time highs in order to buy an undervalued company with enough revenue to make back your purchase cost in less than a decade
Ahhh yes, sounds like that sits comfortably on the efficient frontier. Well done!
Are you kidding?? Go look at the downvotes on your original comment. Do you see others talking like that here? You gotta be joking.
What are you into next? How’d you hear about these stocks? Some screener tool?

You toss and turn as Elon gently rubs your shoulders. "You seem a little tense" says Elon, as you look at your bank account. Your phone shows $107 left to your name. You think to yourself while Elon rubs you down, you pull open Robin Hood, type in TSLA. Leaps $1,100 JAN 2023' are only $1 you can afford 1 leap. This is finally your chance to get rich, you'll be able to actually buy a Tesla. You ask Elon what the next Tesla will be. He says "U, for 'you'" as he smiles sweetly. You picture him dancing on stage explaining U S3XY to everyone multiple times as you smile back at him.
  
  
All of a sudden Elon flips on the TV to CNBC to catch the tail end of Jim Cramer, you see a new law has been passed, "we believe options have inflated the markets into a bubble, we will be imposing a new rule next week only allowing accounts that qualify for day trades to also purchase  options with a $25,000 barrier to entry."
  
You start weeping aloud,  you feel a caring hand wipe your tear away, it's Elon again, "what's wrong my little X'√π3?"   
  
Suddenly you wake, you're in a pool of sweat, at first you panic about the new options policy, then you're filled with relief realizing that options aren't restricted it was all a dream.   
  
You realize this was actually a vision to earn 200,000% gains to buy a TSLA leap. You log into RH, it welcomes you with your $107 balance, you plug in TSLA yolo 2023 @ $1,100 and realize the options are actually $150 each. The best you can do is $1,100 TSLA weekly expiring first week of January.
  
In a slight fit of despair you try to remember the feeling of Elon rubbing your cheek, and rub one out onto your stomach, then roll over back to sleep. A single tear rolls from your eye into your waifu pillow.   
  
^^^YOLO ^^you ^whisper.
In mid summer, there were charts here showing that while the share of physical games is falling  and has been for years, (seriously kids, you can buy games on Steam for longer than Netflix streams movies) the total amount of games sold physically is pretty much the same as it has been 10 years ago.
How is wasting his money on awards instead of saving it to buy GME.

Nuclear is the answer short term. It’s a lot less dangerous than most of the general public think. And I agree that “big oil” would much rather see solar and wind pushed than nuclear. Because it keeps everything dependent on oil. I tend to agree with what you’re saying. But the market isn’t rational. 

Geothermal is the answer long term. But we’ll be dust before that happens.

Except Blockbuster actually had a chance to get in early on the streaming market and transition to be Netflix's main competitor which they horrendously fucked up.

Gamestop doesn't even have a chance.  There is zero room in the online video game market for Gamestop, you either download direct from Microsoft/Sony or if for some reason you want a physical copy, just order on Amazon or if you're a turbo boomer and have to buy your physical copy at a physical location you'd just do it at Walmart or Target which are real stores, not deserted funko pop graveyards.

Overall I am very bullish on AAPL, I closed my position Monday because it was way up and it had run very far very fast and I saw a pullback was likely. I got lucky and it ended up doing what I expected. My plan was to re-enter around 130 after the Jan 5th election. With your Sep calls you have plenty of time, at this point I would keep them unless you are way up and can lock in profits.
It is a bullshit flag

You may be right, but we are at an unprecedented level of high right now. If you follow the average over the last 100 years, it doesn’t stand to reason that it is sustainable. Even most people in the industry say prices are overvalued.

Having said all that, I agree completely: it’s not wise to try and time the market. However, I can’t help but feel like what we’re experiencing is simply not sustainable, and that’s why I am where I am about it. I could very well be wrong, I’ll admit.

I am not suggesting that this is going to fully close the loop. I am saying that Salesforce could get wrecked if their system does not have the same capabilities as Palantir once the data is ingested and connected with other public and private sources. A human still has to smile and dial and build the campaigns, but if your customer data records are super duper complete, making a sale is easier.
> So if someone has $4k, and your hotels cost $4.5k, it would be better to build a hotel than 3 houses, despite the ROI.

Well, per the comment two shove, the better tactic is to ignore ROI and buy four houses, because there are a limited number available. They're not guaranteed to land on your hotel this round and go bankrupt, but if you can take all the houses out of the pool you reduce the potential income they can make, giving you a much higher probability of eventually winning.

> But putting 500 in the middle plus every tax is the way to go. If youre losing it, 

That's why the game takes forever. It's a catch-up mechanic that prevents the person losing from actually losing. And they're often more likely to get it because while the winning player will prance around the board, the listing player is going to keep ending up in jail which is the corner before the parking space.

If your goal is to make the game never end though, yeah, play with the lottery pile that prevents the inevitable loser from ever losing. Or... don't do that, and play with auctions, and when the game ends you can play again in less time than the lottery game would take.

Or, alternatively, you could play a good game.

Well as a responsible adult, I would just go index funds (i.e. VTSAX), but I'll let you make your own choices. This is WSB not r/investing of course.

Ok Elon, we know you can’t tweet because of SEC. But we also know you are here giving awards to comments.

Send us a sign. Give me an award as a clue for your next move.

Edit: ok so a guy gave me platinum. I won’t say it’s name because otherwise people will know Elon’s Reddit.

He didn’t say anything however because he gave me two platinum, I deducted the following:

#Elon wants us to know the price of TSLA will double soon. 

In conclusion, I will buy as many TSLA as I can.
Yeah I’ll have to take a look at them again. Are options not available yet?
Ok good DD. Now turn all this into a meme so I can really understand
Thank you very much!
nah

&#x200B;

Speaking non-autistically, this is very very unlikely to happen. What you are proposing is to time the market - when in the last 10 years has the market "cooled down again?". 

&#x200B;

Yes it's hot now. The market is hotter than it was at the start of the year. And the start of this year was hotter than the last year. Repeat x10.  

&#x200B;

The only time the "I'll wait till the market has cooled off" strategy has worked was the "lost decade" due to dotcom bubble crash. Aside from that, at literally every interval in stock market history, time in the market has outperformed timing the market. 

&#x200B;

Assuming you're a diamond handed long-term player as you say, just buy good companies (FAGMAN) or ETFs like ARK and just hold/DCA into those for 20 years and profit.

> But it’s a fact the creator made the game to be a representation of the inequality of monopolies and the way society develops them.

The creator then took it to Parker Brothers who refused to publish it. It then circulated around various communities and was adapted and modified and changed in various ways until the *credited* creator played it at a friend's party, took down the rules, and presented it to Parker Brothers himself, got a publishing deal, and became the first boardgame millionaire.

It's an even better criticism of capitalism than the original creator had even intended.

Not necessarily, because the next earnings will take into account the PS5, Xbox Series X (+ the subscriptions \[the deal with Microsoft\]), so I don't know we will see. But if you are sure it will tank, sell before earnings then buy the dip I guess. At least, it worked last earnings.

Big corporations (and some smaller ones) have been using N=1 tests to optimise ads for some time now. There's also a famous tale about a big box store finding out about some young lady's pregnancy before her dad did, thanks to this kind of thech.

I think they are able to but only with the consent of the clients. So my point is still that you need the actual data available or consented to be available.

For intelligence, I am sure that alliances share this kind of info. For private companies? More unlikely.

this is news... the rumor was last week
People usually figure out mortgages before the other rules like auctions. They then find out how to abuse them by just mortgaging whatever other players aren't close to for free money when needed. Flawless strategy.

Except you know what other rule people don't follow? *You gotta pay your fucking taxes on your mortgages, you tax dodging deadbeat criminal!* Every time you un-mortgage a property you have to pay 10% of the mortgage amount in taxes (to the bank, not the parking lottery, sheesh).

While it surely does make a huge difference what the inputs are, I doubt it is the only factor.

Totally depends on your time horizon and your whole capital. I'd say three things:

* First, this is a risky play but huge reward potential (you can x2 your capital or more without leverage) so if you go in keep that in mind, and diamond hand really. I do not say this to trigger a short-squeeze, honestly if it happens it happens but it's not up to WSB at all. I say diamond hand if you go in because of the past daily returns: the stock can go down or sideways for a long time then... BOOM, huge daily return. You could miss it if you sell it too fast.
* Secondly, you don't have to enter with one position. For example you can buy 50% of the total amount you are willing to invest. Then after a catalyst, let's say the next earnings, if it dips hard you can put the other 50%. If it shoots up, too bad you can invest it elsewhere (I don't recommend chasing it at this point).
* Try to think in terms of relative performance not absolute amounts, it can be misleading otherwise. So yeah 370$ is perfectly fine, so is 100$ or 10000$.
Then go make some on GNOG shares. I know what people will do with $600 around here and it isn't buying gold.

It was also stolen, which only makes the analogy to capitalism even better.

The original game was created and patented as "The Landlord's Game" by a woman named Lizzy Magie, who actually tried to license the game to Parker Brothers but was turned down. It was shared and played in various communities who all modified and tweaked the game to their liking, and some renamed it to monopoly. The credited designer was invited to a house party to play the monopoly game, took the rules and changed very little else, brought it to Parker Brothers and got it published, and became the first "board game millionaire".

The history of the game perfectly encapsulates the message it was originally created to explain. The collective work of dozens of people culminated in one person who ultimately contributed very little receiving all of the fame and fortune.

It all depends on FDA approval for their genomic testing kit. Apparently it is more accurate than their leading competitor (pacific biosciences, market cap ~$5B) and costs about 20-40x less. I don't think institutions (e.g. arkg) will start buying in force until the FDA approval is confirmed. They also have a symposium coming up in just over a week, where I think they'll talk about their testing kit.

If FDA approval happens and they can compete with PacB, then they still have over a 10x upside before reaching PacB's market cap. However, they also also running out of money and will likely dilute shares during the run up, reducing the upside some.
So, you’re pushing for deflation now?

IMO all it would take is a great platform which is nice to use, to pull me away from steam. I've hated the user experience of steam since the day I started gaming on a PC.

Can't rely on emerging markets, as renewables capacity is growing faster than fossil already, and will only accelerate. When an oil major faces the possibility of stranded assets, in say a decades time, do you think they'll be content to restrict production to support high prices?

Except Amazon is a great company that offers competitive prices on many items. DASH jacks up restaurant prices and rapes their customers. It’s fun to use a few times until you get sick of paying 2x what you would if you were to phone in your order and pick it up from the resty yourself. DASH is one of these concepts that works in SF where everyone makes $120k/yr and can afford to flush money down the toilet for lukewarm food. This shit will not last beyond 2-3 orders per custie in KY or KS or anywhere outside of SF, LA, ATX, etc. so they are throwing money away just like their custies do on this expansion. Dog shit company will crash and burn.

Overall $2k gain in trading account. Was up $20k at one point mid March shorting the market.

Then lost most of it:

\- continuing to short the market as I thought the bounce back was temporary

\-trying to time Tesla ( way too much intra-day volatility)

\-messed up bets on Crude (contracts rolling forward)

\-chasing losses in Dec with highly levered bets

Vertical cracking can be due to clenching or previously acquired trauma. Horizontal cracking means you probably smacked it on something. It depends how “cracked” it looks and feels. I’ve had patients with vertical pressure cracks from clenching their teeth in their sleep and I’ve had people with horizontal molar cracks that would hit a nerve if you stuck a fingernail into it. 

It is possible you are smacking the vape against your teeth more than you are aware of. Try to not slam metal into your teeth daily.

That doesn’t negate the trillions of stimulus Biden would pass up and how the market would react to it, plus it’s not like they can just increase taxes like that. Trump’s tax acts would have to expire first and then those increases wouldn’t kick in immediately either and Dems would be stupid to raise taxes after an economic recovery. 

Outlawing oil usage? Lmao come on man even as a Trump supporter that’s just silly. You think America could stop using oil in 4 years? Lol. Dems are insanely bullish for oil. I think you meant they’ll make it harder for oil companies to drill and set up pipes? That means oil goes up not down

Indeed, which is the precise reason why it could conceivably own the category?

Salesforce is like a $200B company. Palantir could eat that entire business for breakfast with a CRM/BI layer on top of their database. I imagine the top notch engineers over there could even build out a migration tool for anyone who wanted to switch. 

If this thing can find out all information available about any given person, they win the CRM game.

Do the first two years + pregnancy suck?  A little bit but after that it's a lot of fun.  Beyond that, life don't end at 30 bro.

I haven’t done this in a while, but home price highs themselves probably aren’t the best indicator. Do some math and determine if 30 year mortgage payments are at all time highs. $300k @ 6% is pretty equivalent $400k @ 3% even without inflation. Add that and the difference gets even larger. When comparing these things, I think it’s better to think about payment costs, not home values. People generally spend the maximum they can afford in housing, property tax and mortgage together. Can you calculate average payments from the previous peak along with average taxes adjust for inflation for today and compare. That will likely tell a more accurate story than home prices alone.
No where.  Physical gold, if anything,  demands a premium

Removing data silos means that all your data from various systems can be used on one system (Palantir). To do this in real time, the systems need to integrate with palantir (Or the database integrates with them). So after an initial data load of records, records are then added and updated in real time. They could have ML designed to sort incoming records into appropriate data views. 

With this data you can do whatever you want with it. Run ML, make relationship graphs, display latest information about an individual or group. Palantir seems to have some ML or method to sanitize data and find insights. 

The impressive bit to me is the performance claims. I helped with a similar product but the issue with it was performance.

Congratulations on educating yourself by watching a 17-minute long youtube video:

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMmocnLnVgQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oMmocnLnVgQ)

But in that very same video Lynch mentions yet another stupid assumption that's echoed here, which was 'Could it go any lower? The price must go up'. Well, market doesn't owe you shit, securities don't go up or down just because you want them to. Regardless of how irrational market acts, it is what it is - an agreed price between willing seller and a willing buyer at certain point in time. Like it or hate it.
Post 9/11 it was on the up and up but fell flat around the time we got boots on the ground (why?). 
Didnt pick up pace again until 2006ish which I think had to do with the F35 program. 
Now of course 2008 came around and things were flat for Obama's first term, but come 2012 when ISIS was all over the headlines... that's when LMT mooned.
Weird I just can't think of anything a big city has that would require living in it. Like I live 5 minutes outside a city of 100k that has everything that I need. And if there is ever something that I want to do in a big city I can fly to Chicago in like an hour for like $200-300 lol.

Yeah that’s true, there’s no competition and never will be. LMT NOC RTX will always be the big dogs. If you were the U.S. government though would you wanna buy from an inexperienced company defense start up?

For the principle really. The amount isn't relevant. I don't react well to ultimatums and they were trying to take money I didn't owe by restricting access to my digital games. So I thought fuck that. If it was 22k worth of games it would've gone the same way.

I played the piano much more since then. Made more money and done more work without the distraction. Spent nothing on this console cycle and would rather read DD than play games. Feels like a win to me.

I trust RC and current management has an strong incentive if they dont want to get a kick on their asses. GME is different to cases you mention because current stores can be used as warehouses for last mile delivery. If they figure out logistics, give a good customer experience and leverage on exclusive deals it should be pretty easy.

That proves my point, you actually don't know shit. LTCM used to be a hedge fund from the 90s, had two Noble prize winners in Economics on it's board. So I have absolutely no fucking idea what do you mean by saying '*if you want to do LTCM successfully*'.

>You talk about LTCM but then you focus on one bad year for oil

One bad year that is. Yeah, right. That's corona that caused their shares to drop. Riiight. Do you know anything about the tickers in question? Or anything at all?

>What I’m suggesting is purchasing securities at fair value discounts,  securities that have had a bad period but have high chances of  rebounding

Be my guest, do it. Mortgage your house, borrow as much as you can from your friends and family and go long at margin that your brokerage is willing to offer if you're so damn confident (based on god-knows-what) that these securities you've mentioned

>have high chances of  rebounding

Because I don't buy that crap for a split second.

I made a quick calculation this morning, out of curiosity. In 2019, an unremarkable year in terms of war, natural disasters or general calamities, the US government earned 10 664,23 dollars per citizen. While spending 13 406.50 dollars, 25.71% more, adding to the $69 469,84 dept per capita. Fun facts!

Dunno man, Ganesh is a great dasher, my food always hot.
Spose's body of work is def substantial, he pumps out albums and builds careers for himself and others around him. And when I say he pumps out albums I mean he produces and writes and records and releases albums like Kanye West do it but more comprehensively with less help and more effort and better ethics and without selling out. He has proven he has the lyrical capacity to make whatever type of rap he wants by dabbling in every style, there's no reason he couldn't make a whole album of dumbed down pop music or high-effort flashy technical skill showcasing if he wanted to just like he randomly breaks out into doing those things for a few bars or a song now and then, but he doesn't do albums like that because he recognizes that level of competitiveness can be toxic and so can dumbing shit down so he rides a middle ground. If he was a better producer he would have the capacity to make a whole album of flashy showoff shit just full of some of the most hard-going banger-sounding rap songs ever made but as it stands he would need to hire a better producer to do that and he doesn't see a reason to when he can just make music tuned to his own taste for himself and his fans to enjoy and just be fuckin happy with life and make other lives better and make society a better place. That's hip-hop personified in this man tbh, he reached hip-hop enlightenment years ago just like DOOM but DOOM was a far better producer and arguably a better rapper by a good margin too so he was probably never gonna lose his crown in his lifetime no matter what.

RA the rugged man tried to be impactful and didn't make it as far as Spose when neither sold out so he might be a top 10 lyricist but to be the avatar of rap you have to master all the elements of hip hop not just the element of lyric

Common guys wake up GME was a bad investment the company has no future. I mean they sell PHYSICAL video games, wich you often can get much cheaper on G2A or other keyseller, the thing that is mainly still keeping them afloat are the pop! figurines and the merch but not everyone is buying their merchandise. Many prefer just to play the games, wich you also can buy online cheaper and also there are games you just can buy online,so there is not really a future for them something that manifests in their willingness to sell you subscriptions. The company might retain their business in some places but will probably decline. If you look for something where you will get money from buy Games  Workshop shares.

But they consciously had to make that decision.  It is no longer obvious, and they are also releasing a version without one.  There is a clear trend here.  As high speed internet becomes ubiquitous and storage space becomes cheaper, GameStop becomes obsolete.  Unless they shift their focus to gaming accessories, VR sales, or some other area where there is any actual benefit to visiting a physical storefront before purchasing, then they're done.

In my case the objection is not the stock itself, but the fact it is being artificially pumped so hard here and Stocktwits.  Whenever you see artificial pumping it is always suspicious that it is a pure pump and dump.

In fact, I don't understand why people poorer than me are telling me how I am not as fortunate, being born in one of the most technologically advanced nations right now.

Yeah, it's climbing, and this might be the last console cycle where we have physical discs. This change is still not as fast as people think. The argument "nobody buys discs any more when you can just download" isn't true.

It might become true by 2027, which places GameStop in the position where it almost has to listen to Cohen to survive.

Will that happen? Nobody knows for sure.

Will 2021 see the company posting profits? Yup, and this is gonna shoot the market cap at least to 3 billion, probably more (5bn?). Most importantly, this will happen very fast, maybe as soon as January, definitely after the Q4 report in March.  


1 to 3 months to at least double, maybe triple my money is a very good return for me, especially after I'm already 55%+ up on GME in 2020.

I could've already doubled my money if I didn't listen to gaybears, but it's not too late still.
Noticing the recent downgraded sentiment but upgraded price. Yeah, no shit bruh!

They control the country with unquestionable rule. It's an authoritarian one-party state which has total control over it's economy and people. If the Communist Party thought it would be in their best interest to seize a Chinese corporation and fuck over the foreign investors, they absolutely can do that. Shares of Chinese companies don't actually make you entitled to any amount of ownership or control in that company.

We may see a lot of this PR for PLTR in the weeks until demo day that will increase interest. I had a bias for PLTR because of the secretive reputation it had and attracting superstar engineering talent and of course backing by big names like Peter Thiel.  Most of this is just clever marketing. Engineers familiar with the product though say that it's rudimentary and there hasn't been much growth in the product. The company's been declining the past few years.

I think going long on PLTR is a mistake, the more I look at it. They've been struggling to enter the consumer sector for a while, and there's no reason that they'll have much room for growth and expansion in the future. There are plenty of competitors in the space already and their products are overpriced. There may be some upside in the short-term though so prove me wrong, hopefully.

Dude, if the market was always right, bubbles wouldn't happen. And the reason oil is down is because Corona. But since most cars on the road are still gas and we're still using tons of plastic, asphalt, and WD40 I'd say oil will definitely soar this year. Note that last year's dramatic rise in EV sales still accounts for less than 2% of cars sold and a tiny fraction of cars on the road. The irony being while some of the OP's arguments are silly (any investment strategy that assumes systemic corruption is wrong), he may make money for reasons he doesn't understand.

First, thank you, which makes god of this sub. Second, Tsla isnt the only company in this universe.
I'm a young old head and Spose [discarded his own record deal after it was already signed](https://youtu.be/Rqq4Mw_55SE) because he doesn't really care if you hear about him so he's not like some random YouTube rapper who just says the reason they're not famous is because they don't want to be, you can't really use the "why isn't he famous" argument on him, in fact since you have to sell out to get really famous these days your argument just makes it sound like your top 5 rappers might be weak sellouts

Biggie was the last hip hop king the record labels were dumb enough to take mainstream without considering the ramifications to their power structure. They don't allow that shit anymore, if you want to be the best you have to go underground, hopefully not literally ffs what is with the curse on best rappers dying I hate it and [I hope Spose is strong enough to put a stop to it once and for all](https://youtu.be/Iobcegiu22s)

Also since you mentioned Eminem here's a semi rare track from back when he dabbled in actual hip-hop and even in this song you can hear the foreshadowing that he would sell out in fact it almost says so if you're interested in hearing: https://youtu.be/EKOPq3pDQBM 

And an actually rare unreleased Eminem track you might appreciate if you're a stan of his: https://youtu.be/KEm_rsOlBgM

And an even rarer M&M track from before he changed it from Eminem if you want to hear why it took him so long to get skilled enough to even have the opportunity to sell out: https://youtu.be/-Icv63KulZg

And since he started this whole conversation here's an **MF DOOM** track that shouldn't be rare by any logic I can see but for some reason a lot of DOOM fans haven't heard it when it's a really good meta rap about rapping and collaborating on music: https://youtu.be/oPBbe8NRxAo

Cause we don't really get where they're coming from. 

Sure they give up a shit ton of freedom but life's pretty sweet. In exchange for keeping quiet, they tap into this insane integrated and streamlined ecosystem. Plus...they make a fuckton of money in the process.
The OP has major gaps in his logic, but let me fill you in about China. First is cost cutting is king, as every stage of production of anything will increase profit margins. Second is putting on a face is of extreme importance. Third is government offices are highly competitive positions with officials promoted/sacked often based on a single economic number. All this produced some weirdness when their green plans were announced.

When Beijing announces plans, they are vaguely defined, megalomaniac, has an arbitrary deadline, and the details are left to underlings to figure out. Reality always fall far short of what state own news predicts.

Implementation varies wildly between locales. In one case a city announces all public works would be self sustaining and started putting solar panels and small windmills of all the street lamp. Of course, all these expensive building projects went to companies owned by the friends/families of government officials. But this got farcical when people realized most of the green energy was a hastily forged fake. A lot of lamps ran without any wires connecting the solar panel. A lot of the windmills never spun. Some of these windmills were found to have motors and were drawing power. And so on and so forth.

Also, the numbers China gives are misleading. They'll give numbers that show what percentage coal power is being reduced by, not how fast they're replacing coal. In the US, for comparison, no new coal plants are being built. But coal plants near a century old were so robustly built that it is far cheaper to overhaul them than spend a literal fortune replacing them. So coal plants go offline one by one and each is replaced with a green solution. In China, this is not the case. In China cheap and expendable coal plants are being replaced with new ones constantly. Green solutions have risen in production, but those are also cheap copies that need replaced often. And since coal is getting cheaper due to shrinking demand elsewhere, it's likely this trend will continue.

In Russia, however, it's a very different story. They still have a bunch of old Soviet stuff that was built to last. They also have a much smaller budget than many western countries and don't have a quickly growing population to service. As such new things are coming only slowly.

But you’re inconsistent in what you’re saying. You talk about LTCM but then you focus on one bad year for oil stating that this is it, oil is not going to rebound while it’s trading at less than book value. What I’m suggesting is purchasing securities at fair value discounts, securities that have had a bad period but have high chances of rebounding and therefore sustaining solid and predictable future cash flows - this is the pure definition of value investing and LTCM (if you want to do it successfully)
As for the last point, sold my green positions given by the inefficient market and I’m moving everything in something solid like those juicy oil dividends and share repurchases

You'd have more luck betting on gay marriage being fully legalised in Poland than electric cars picking up in EE within the next 10 to 20 years lmao in 2019 around 6k electric cars were crusing polish streets and polish politicians are all excited promising that this number will increase to... 600.000!

Bruh people still burn trash in old ass furnaces across Poland (especially south east) making places like Krakow or Katowitze one of the most polluted cities in the world, and the government barely even cares - and yet people think they will go crazy about electric cars. 

And I'm using Poland as a shining example as out of all slavic countries it is the richest and most modern. Imagine this happening in Serbia... not.

If you are suggesting cOvId isn’t real, why the 15% increase in deaths from 2019 with everyone pretty much being staying in their homes the whole year? You can’t say it’s car accidents or everyone killing themselves because it wasn’t that.
I like how fast you can place trades in ToS. One screen with the options chain and another with all your underlying and companion charts. You can get in and out in a second if need be. RH is nice for duration positions but honestly I like ToS's interface. I also like Windows 98 so take it with a grain of salt

There are tons of people that want to buy. Combine that with the fact that sellers are also buyers and it's a lack of supply.
Suck dick and give bj to 🌈mods
So here's the theory.

Speculative options trading is at all time highs by a lot, it's almost all calls, and it's almost all single or single digit contract trades. Retail margin usage is also at all time highs. These leveraged trades have an outsized impact on the market. Now maybe retail never runs out of cash and can forever yolo cash and margin into the market to keep valuations pumped even as institutions rebalance and take profits. Or there's a dip, retail paper hands their positions because they're trading with borrowed money, the dip continues dipping, more retail runs into liquidity issues, they get margin called and are forced to unwind all these leveraged positions because normies fomoing in at all time highs with their students loans have no cash reserves.
We’ll see nerd
Really? 

Deadlier than the peak Civil War or WW2 years? Deadlier than the height of the Spanish flu or the polio epidemic?

Not sure about that one

Edit: I suppose if they are counting just total deaths and not percentage of population it might be possible. However, in that case virtually every year that the countries population has grown has been the deadliest in our history

I guess that's an idea.
This autist is absolutely spot on.

iPhone sales were all crammed into the quarter just finished and the upcoming ER will crush YoY. That is a given and Tim and Luca said as much in the last EC.

The long online store delivery times for products and with multiple product lines out of stock in stores across the world is because demand for iPhones, iPads, and Macs were through the roof in the Covid landscape. Factories in China have been up and running at full speed for a good nine months or so so it’s not due to supply-side constraints. Global demand for Apple’s products has been stratospheric.

With the lack of stock for these products, Apple will have been selling wearables by the boatload. Apple Watch and AirPods hit the spot price-wise for holiday season gifting and have not had issues with stock.

The super cycle has been in full swing and the Pro phones this year have made more people switch from other ecosystems, and upgrade their older iPhones. The new design language, coupled with upgraded cameras, and a lower comparable price to the previous generation of iPhones, have made the Pro-level iPhones extremely popular this year.

TL:DR Apple is going to crush earnings next ER.

Position: 1500 stocks in AAPL
Idk man just Google it, over half of console games are downloaded now, and that number is climbing.

I'd look at the underlying and pick out companies that meet your criteria - when you buy a sector ETF you get a lot of garbage that will average down your returns.  Better to pick a handful of winners and spread your buy among them, still gives you protection if one fails but larger profits if you pick correctly.

I said that it's a safe play for the next decade. There will be no fleet of electric airplanes in the next decade. The technology is too new and underdeveloped at this point. Maybe in 30 years time you will be right. But in 10 years? No way
I’ve been doing it on TSLA just selling cash covered puts. Never got assigned yet to start selling the calls

Planning on buying 300+ shares of AAPL and start selling covered calls tho as well

With the TSLA options I’ve been selling them a week out for like $600-$1,500 premiums 

Let them bleed till they’re down to like $200 or less, close position and sell another strike price/ date 

Rn I’m holding a TSLA put over the weekend that’s decaying like $130 per day 🤣

That contract is gonna open on Monday down +$300 no matter what. TSLA beating 500k deliveries number would just be icing on the cake lmao

I was stanning for Eminem during those debates because I didn't know hip-hop very well I just knew rap. I literally thought hip-hop is just a type of instrumental beat for rap to go on. So embarrassing to look back at those days, I'm making up for it by educating others now. Sorry you don't like it, maybe you didn't learn as much and grow as much from that Eminem debate era as I did.

I think AI has the capability to be creative. You see the deep mind system playing that computer game against pros a few months back? That's with limited training. The gamers playing against deep mind said the AI was playing moves they hadn't seen from humans over 10 years of playing.

A year or two back I saw a video where they put AI to work designing pieces for cars. They input what they wanted the design to achieve and the AI tested about 7 million designs before settling on what it considered the best one. That was quite creative.

I agree with everything else though. Long term PLTR looks healthy.

gotta wait until it dips to sell low
Yeah man you 100% need to stop watching porn for one. Also cut down the jerking off. Do these two things and your body will take care of the sex performance
Its 50/50,for every buy there is a seller
Buying calls is basically betting a stock price will hit a certain price by a specific day. Buying puts is a bit it will go down to a price by a specific day. With shares you can wait forever for it to go up or down, but with options it has to be by that day. Hence it’s a lot more leveraged.
I'm a working grad student.

I study military history while working as a security guard at a refinery. My boss doesn't know it but I've been applying for LEO positions.
I've already kinda clarified what I meant by "best" and I think you should be able to understand that nothing you just said really applies to what I'm saying. Like, it's "always changing" - yes, it just changed from DOOM to Spose, how is that supposed to refute my point?

I get the feeling part of you agrees with me but you don't want to admit it because the rappers you like most subjectively are objectively really bad so it would be embarrassing for you to accept the reality. I hope you at least pirate your music instead of paying to reaffirm the delusion that what you listen to objectively has credibility in comparison with true hip-hop artists like Biggie and DOOM and Spose.

Perhaps the reason we went from "your favorite rapper's favorite rapper" to someone completely underrated is because normies find it less embarrassing to be honest about someone like Biggie or DOOM objectively occluding their favorites but when it's a white YouTube rapper at the top it gets harder to swallow the fact that for some reason you prefer the stuff at the bottom
If you go full renewable you have to couple it with something like Musk's huge battery farms to store and release energy, otherwise you're correct it won't meet peak demands.

I think they had a project in Australia, and maybe one in Puerto Rico iirc if you want to read up on what they're doing.

From my experience buying a stock is a hell of a lot easier than selling at stock. What I mean is it's pretty easy to identify a good company, buy the stock and then just wait. 

However when it comes time to take profit and sell your position, it suddenly becomes much harder. On the one hand you don't want to sell early and miss potentially hundreds more percent growth, but leave it too late and you risk giving back 50% or more, or worse the stock just trends downwards / sideways for years on end. 


So when do you decide to finally sell? Is it when you've hit your completely arbitrary price target? Do you sell based on technical setup or do you look for a fundamental reason?

“Oil will still be needed, because everything relies on it” 

until it doesn’t. 

Technology is advancing at such a rabid pace that by 2035 we could have electric airplanes that run only on wind power or charge stations. I believe that’s the problem with your DD, you keep thinking about the past and present, but not the future. We literally are making breakthroughs that usually take years happening in only months, so by the time 2035 -2040 or whatever, humanity would have already made fossil fuels obsolete by then. I like your effort for putting this together, however It’s based in a delusion that mankind will stay the same in the next 30 years which is highly unlikely. To proof my point I want you to ask someone in 1990 if it’s possible to have miniature hand sized computer that’s light and you can take anywhere. You are going to shoot you’re self in the foot thinking like this, just try to be more open minded and you should be fine.
Guys what are we doing with GME, are we selling on market open or we holding onto it diamond hands?

My advice is stop trading options and take a break before you return, chasing losses is just going to make you more of a degenerate and if that 20k loss hurt losing another 10k is just gonna hurt even more, atleast at this point you still have 10k

Looking at your post history you had $55 GME calls so I think your desperate because $55 FD’s are insane, theta gang will have been cheering seeing their $55 calls filled
it was too busy commenting on my other post
Well if you really hold that sentiment then you should want it to hit 800 first. you'd be lucky to get that call in the money. And if you still think it has means to go down, that means there's another good entry point waiting for you.

Selling a put could be a good hedge for your uncertainties though
This is very specific

Day 2 and going strong

Alhamdullilah brothers I have successfully completed 2 days without p or fapping, it’s a small duration of time but I’ve been trying for months and I have to admit, I was pretty addicted and my addiction was at an absurd level.
Some members of this Reddit have helped me a lot and appreciate them very much along with all of you people who give us hope and help us support each other get our lives back.
From tomorrow onwards I’ll be spending most of my day alongside family members which will help me have less alone time (if any) and increase my chances of succeeding to beat this addiction, I don’t have a “90 day goal” or anything, rather I have a goal to get to a point where I become a “nofap addict” <- this was a term that a brother who helped me out (mashallah he did 250+ days) told me that he had as the energy and benefits of nofap were so strong that he now controls his urges and knows how to stay on the right path at all times.

Stay strong brothers, Inshallah we’ll quit this sin and get a halal wife in the future ameen. May Allah also forgive us for all our sins and grant us jannah al Firdaus ameen.

All love for my brothers here

You realize it's retarded to ignore ethics if you're trying to make an objective judgement about anything hip-hop related since hip-hop is an ethos right? So you're just trying to justify ignoring ethics and pushing hip-hop to degrade into trap-pop while trying to make yourself sound like less of a retarded asshole by hyperbolically referring to consideration of philosophical validity as "listening to music purely for the ethics" I'm guessing

I think we're being stricter about positions or ban than ever. 

We have a bot that looks at your screenshot, finds all the numbers in it, and makes sure there's absolute_value(largest_number) >= 2500. During that routine it also screens out the robinhood frontpage (here's a squiggly line) screenshots, which usually means they can only post the "your positions" screen or a screenshot of a brokerage we don't know how to deal with yet.

I could look to make sure there's at least one ticker but I'd bet it'll have some false positives and people will be angry.

That’s exactly what I want to try to do. Ive been trying to trade stocks. But now I mostly just want to hold and chill as I cbf with the stress trying to trade penny stocks or volatile ones. I’ve made enough profit where the % movement would mean I make an acceptable amount of money every day. I just want to try to bag 1-2% more on big highs where I feel like the downside is much higher than the upside.  So you have been doing this for 3 weeks now on Tesla ? Or other stocks? The thing with Tesla was if I had tried this shit at 600 I would of been rekt since it moved away from 600. Not sure if it’ll be a repeat at 700 or not

I love how you say either as if this is an equation. As if its a 50/50 shot while in reality like 90% of people lose money on the stock market, and the lucky 10% is mostly made up of people who made scraps so probably less than 1% of investors made a real profit that would allow them to spend it on a yacht and hookers with cocaine (wonder how many of them have some inside information and how many actually made profit just because of their market knowledge).

Don't chase losses, especially by buying an incredibly overvalued meme stock at the top of a stratospheric bull market run. And especially don't buy calls on it.

Or do it, whatever, it's your money and you might get lucky with a stupid play like thousands of other people have lately.

Oil is non renewable. Companies are already running out of places to drill. If oil was abundant there wouldn't have been wars in the middle east. Oil prices may sky rocket in the future but its usage will be equivalent to diamonds today.
I like how you go low when you run out of arguments.   
Please explain us the massive material and environmental costs to make the storage techniques you just described. Are you aware how much of the power generation is currently with renewables and how much more we would need to replace all fossil fuels?   
This is not even about electrical engineering. Just simple math and physics.   
By throwing jargon and low blows, you only show us that you are an ignorant man child who does not understand basic science.

The answer to your question is yes.
Who else here thinks Palantir using their tech as a search engine for the public, like google only better, is a possibility?
Lol I know it's a stupid mentality to have. Imagine being scared I'm going to hit my strike price which was exceptionally high to begin with. But Come on we seriously thinking TSLA going to $800 in Jan? I feel like it'll be $600 before it'll be 800. Hence my play. I mean alternatively I could buy a put I guess. But the prices on puts are retardedly expensive right now.
I'm talking objectively though. Like if you don't like Spose's music that's fine but if you think he's not the top of the game you're just in denial. I mean imagine if someone didn't like listening to Doom cause his flow was weird and they said that means he's not the best. You can have rappers you subjectively think are better, like for me I'd say Dopey Ziegler or Kanye West, but objectively I can't prove Dopey Ziegler is being underrated on purpose so objectively the possibility that his obscurity is a result of failure makes it impossible for him to take the crown, and objectively I can't prove Kanye West barely tries lyrically so objectively the possibility that his lyrical mediocrity is a result of failure makes it impossible for him to take the crown. You can have your own subjective ideas of rappers you think might be better than Spose too but that doesn't give them the top of the game crown either because if your theory of what makes them so good was stronger than the argument for Spose and had proof to it I'd probably already know that. Spose can build audience size by his own skill without divine intervention, you CAN objectively prove his obscurity is intentional because unlike Dopey Ziegler this guy ripped up a record deal, he's caused 0 deaths with his music, saved multiple lives with it, he really has no weaknesses, the fact that people can't admit he's objectively the best is just people being dumb. If you want to say he's not objectively the best rapper, just name any other rapper with any reasoning for how they're better

Also tbh I'm sure you can at least mildly enjoy some of his songs even subjectively -

5% stop loss, 10% target, if the conditions that caused you ro enter disappear you exit immediately. I'm comfy with $2,000 flipping for $200 or losing $100 but I suppose it scales as long as you can lose 4-5 times in a row and still feel fine. It's when you deviate from linear gains or losses you start getting bad risk habits. I like 10 DTE but I'm still figuring it out.

The strike is at 780. In terms of raw profit, you are right covered calls, naked puts. Same same. Except I honestly feel Tesla cannot sustain a $700 price range going into the first 2 months of 2021. The market cannot sustain Nasdaq 13000, Spy 374. That's what I'm sort of trying to achieve I guess? Making the difference between a few % Points and also reaping the put contract premium. Is this stupid? It would equate to a couple of grand.

The thing is, if you're holding shares and you don't take the profit, you get fked by the same amount anyway right? What I mean is if it tanks $100 whether you get allocated the shares at 690 or you hold all the way down on the existing shares you have. You still take the loss? So you don't really get screwed unless it pops up to 800, you buy in and then it tanks $200 lol.

70% + of nextgen consoles are disc-enabled. Most people still buy discs. The transition to digital-only is much slower than most of you gaybears think.

Just because you're tech savvy and download games, does not mean most of the customers and normies do.

Most GME bulls are looking to exit some time in 2021. Unless Cohen pulls off a miracle. But that remains to be re-evaluated at later point.

Allocate percentages of your capital to different risks. That way you don't lose everything quick. Holding through that second swing up is quite impressive. Maybe TSLA hits 1000 next year.

They think Tesla is big because it has electric cars, but electric cars are big because it has Tesla. 

And they call us the retards.
Like any commodity there are ups and downs. Clearly COVID had a huge impact on oil demand and subsequently oil prices. But it’s naive to think that because oil and related stocks are priced low atm that there is no room for growth. 

Sure maybe oil companies will never have the multiples of renewables but they will reward investors through cash flow and dividends. 

I don’t agree with OP’s logic and I’m not saying oil is the future or anything because of course it isn’t, but in terms of short to medium term I think there are many reasons to be bullish on oil. And conversely I think most are aware that the recent appreciation on green stocks is likely a bubble and not sustainable in the short/medium term.

Use all the pain that you've felt in your life as the currency, go out and trade it for blood. You are not you. You are now us. We are the only ones that you can trust. You'll become fear. They'll become dust. Before this moment you didn't mean much. You are the slaughtering vessel of punishment born to do nothing but justify us. Give us your empathy, we'll give you lust.

Pumped hydro projects are all about making the $ from energy firming ( yes firming solar and wind) and energy arbitrage ( sold as cap and swap products in the financial markets). I can go on but think about firming renewables and how batteries ( shallow storage) and pumped hydro (deep storage) will do this more and more done for the next 100 years.

Ha I’ve actually gone long on Tesla more than I’ve shorted it, since you looked at my posts you should have seen how I recently turned 2.5k to 15.5k on tsla call spreads. I actually once lost 40k on tsla calls in 2019 as well. I’m definitely retarded tho won’t argue with that. 

Regardless I am very confident this position will be profitable, whatever happens I will post the loss/gain for it. Also even if TSLA exceeds expectations and is green on Monday I still think there is a possibility of this position working out due to selling pressure rest of the week. We shall see.

From what I‘ve read on their IR site

• New collaboration with MSFT:

„Through this partnership, GameStop will standardize the Company’s business operations on Microsoft’s cloud solutions and hardware products to deliver rich new digital experiences to customers, creating the “ultimate gaming destination” for gamers in its vision to be the premier omni-channel customer access point for video game products.“

• They‘ll sell Xboxes including up to 24 months of FREE gold memberships exclusively 

• MSFT will build the backbone of IT in all GME stores

I think that’s a pretty strong partnership, especially combined with Xbox exclusives.

Edit: however „ultimate gaming destination“ to me is a bit far fetched. PC has Steam, Xbox and PS do have their own networks. Everyone is separating slowly like movie streaming services too. All I can see right now is that GME could become a plattform for certain exclusive contents and deals.
It’s wild that you could give a random person 100K and it not really dent your portfolio.  Good job and hope you have even better luck this year!

Oil demand is in steep decline and will be halved by 2050. The price will collapse. Petrochemical use in industrials alone won’t be enough to pin the price where they want even with cartel production manipulation. Not an industry worth putting money in. Analysts have around a 5% success rate of projecting oil prices and this retard OP isn’t any smarter.
>No one is imagining this as a long term play

That doesn't stop people from pretending it is, though. Only a month ago, when I pointed out this was a simple pump and dump people got up in arms over it. Guess we're nearing the dump, since people are open about it now.

While I think oil is going to be fine too, it's more of a stable play compare to renewable. Especially when you are listing BIG oil

That isn't what this sub is about.
I will have to re-write your DD and it's not worth it. But hey, for sale of basic knowledge, solar and wind are what we called intermittent sources. We need base load generators (coal , gas peakers) to firm this intermittent energy. The base load generators are being replaced with utility batteries ( Google yourself tesla, fluence, etc etc) and behind the meter storage. Countries are removing coal, gas and oil from their generation mix as well speak( this has been legislated at states if not federal levels). So your 1st paragraph where you are suggesting that solar and wind cannot exist without oil is incorrect. It can, I build these projects around the world. No problem.

You don't tell the market it's wrong, instead market tells you what fair pricing is. Market has spoken. These companies are fossils and they don't have any room to grow anymore, their time has passed. Now speaking of demand for oil byproducts or anything that's made with the use of oil - well, it's already priced in. Unless you show some decent research and studies that indicate potential for the future growth in demand and how it'd affect business margins, this 'DD' of yours is nothing else but an attempt to sell us 2.5-1.5 decade ago news. Not gonna happen.

I love this TSLA play I've concocted. I have 3 week $610/$615 put credit spreads that will pay out 20% if TSLA stays above $615 and if it works, I'll do it again next month with this month's premium added to the collateral to make it the same payout but safer. In 10 months it'll be super safe and would be up 200% the original starting capital, tacking on an additional 20% in perpetuity until TSLA crashes 15-20% in a single month.

I prefer hard copies. Sony PS locked all my games unfairly. I had a dispute about a payment, they held my digital games for ransom for the sake of $10 which I never owed them, 6 months before a new console too. So with that ultimatum, naturally I told them to get fucked and close my account (which I don't think they expected). $2200 spent on that account over a couple years.

Anyway, my point was they couldn't do that with my hard copies. I could still play those. With digital they sell the license to play the game on their terms. With hard copy you own that shit. So that makes hard copies better for me. Although I have to admit most people don't care and the convenience of digital downloads is real.
But it's not as enviromentally sustainable. I have no problem promoting it because it's profitable, but don't sell a lie to me.
Dam, that seems disruptive in the worst way possible.  What about the other stuff? Is it unique or are organisations just buying it for the convenience of integrating it all in one product?

Yes that makes sense like 95% sure though. If you’d like I can set a reminder and next month when I file my taxes would you like me to let you know I have like $15,000-$20000 net losses I’ve the last 3 years and I just big this. So I will be able to try exactly what you just asked. I normally do my taxes the day after I get my 1099 so I’ll know for sure
>But I think I figured out the secret formula in investing this year after minimal result for past 10 years.

LOL your entire portfolio is in fucking tsla and you lucked out on a massive options gamble in a year they went 8x. You're going to lsoe it all if you actually think you are smart rather than just insanely lucky. None of your other shit has anything to do with your gians.

Congrats though man that life changing money right there
I'd like to shout out at all of your haters.  As of now its 35.
Maybe you should follow your proposed strategy
so basically you fluked on TSLA options in a year they went up 800% and are now trying to claim you have some "golden investment thesis" come on man, be real
Man I'm holding like 300 shares but you literally provide no reason to why it will be 45.

Hope you're right tho.
I dunno man these seems a bit too optimistic for me. 

Yeah, renewables aren't reliable when the sun sets but the kicker is that we use a huge majority of our energy use when the sun is out and wind is high. Solar especially is actually accelerating at such a rapid pace NOT because of panel efficiency but because of how cheap batteries are becoming for the amount of power they hold. This hurts oil as a whole as residents straight up SELL power to the grid themselves and become much more independent in their energy production. 

Relying on emerging markets from "third world countries" seems like a bad bet as well. The ease of setting up small solar panels and battery stations in areas that have small populations and difficult terrain is excellent paired with the fact that oil/gasoline also entitles complicated combustion generation that relies on parts/repair pipeline as well. 

Slightly less demand from business class? Talk about almost annihilation of business flights in an industry that constantly seems to be teetering on profitability in an already hazy future especially as people move BACK to cars and rail as electric kicks ass and will allow us to sleep while our Teslas take us to our destination. 

Interesting DD, don't get me wrong; I love the insight into how oil can be a partner to oil rather than a direct competitor. I used to work on solar panel development in 2015 and had my eyes opened to how powerful this shit is. The development of efficient panels and batteries is WELL beyond what you could even imagine but learning how to process these experimental projects into consumer realities has been difficult but it has been slow and steady progress that has not had any hiccups.

Keep in mind that oil ain't no baby right now. Oil is fucking huge. There are entire economies that rely on its production and refinement. This is not a comeback story from a bruised and battered sector. This is a story where people simply went the other way over time. Coal is a good example in my book. Will we get rid of coal? Maybe one day in the future but there's no reason to go gambling on it anytime soon.

Mmmmh no. I'm not saying the won't do well, I'm saying oil will do better than the market is expecting. And besides, many clean energy companies right now are a dangerous pump and dump
OP it's evident from these comments that you got lucky with Tesla and you don't have a fucking clue what you're doing. Am I jealous of the gains? Yes. Do I want to see you lose 80%? No. If you wish to keep doing this, good luck fuck it bro it's your life

They better cure the fat then. Old boy Kim got the beetus.
So are you suggesting puts on Clean Energy companies?
Sounds like ARK.
That is considered a commodity and while it's not one I feel especially in tune with, it makes sense that it's going up with economies struggling and inflation spiking and war seeming to be on the horizon, and it makes sense it would keep going up until we either get far into that war or reverse the course of the global crisis. My strategy with gold has been buying pretty much every dip knowing it would spike higher again and if someone had that same strategy with steel I would think it seems like they know what they're doing. Again, not my commodity though, might wanna compare my advice with someone who does trade steel. 

Edit - also just gonna add real quick, if you're betting on the price of steel, make sure the ticker you're betting on really does track the price of steel because not all commodity tickers have a very solid relationship with their commodity. Continuing to use gold as an example, the GLD and IAU tickers are just gold stockpiles you can buy shares of so I bet on their price movement instead of mining companies or jewelry companies that can have their own bad news or good news about their operations separate from the price of gold. I wouldn't have any problem with playing one of the mining companies when there's a good opportunity to with good info, it's just a separate thing from betting on pure price.
So buy more?
All of those companies make EVs bud.

thank you for the response. will be looking into commodities. what about MT steel shares? i read dd that said steel demand is at an all time high, is that considered a commodity?

Check out my other comment that I just posted.  Good luck to you!
ohhh, thank you! That's actually really informative and helpful!

I overlooked that first you can write off 3k that was carried over on ordinary income first (which is probably gonna get taxed higher than the capital gains). Thanks!!

So in this case, it looks like short term capital loss can offset long term or short term capital gains next year (if i were to get any gainz?). That makes sense. thanks so much for taking the time to reply and clarify. Happy new year!
Mariana Trench level retarded if we go by this chart

Do it, you will have food and housing provided for you, which means you can throw a decent amount of money in stocks (safe stocks) then when you get out buy a house in cash with that money and go to college living off GI bill (not only does that pay for college they also give you a monthly housing allowance to live off of) 4 years can be good or can be shit but its no where near as bad as some people make it seem just avoid army or marines

I was wondering, why automod had so many awards in this thread. It wasn't automod 😍
Mine looks very similar. Not worried though this thing is shooting up. Diamond 💎 🤚
Sure. Pick a good MOS,  get into cyber or something like that and you'll make a ton when you get out.

I joined the Army, fought, got out, got a couple degrees on the GI Bill. No debt, have property, trading money. Friends for life.

Not all upside obviously, very dark times as well, but you're talking the air force. Pretty limited number of roles in the air force which will leave you messed up. Only caveat I'd offer is if you're a woman - there are some gender specific grim realities you should consider about life in the military.

Play commodities, stonks really kinda are worse for you than scratch off tickets because stonks specialize in taking your $1000 via short expiry options contracts meeting short term price manipulation. Every day market makers try to trick people into taking worthless contracts and every night they look at what contracts people bought and whatever price movement you were betting on, they push the price the opposite direction the next morning, just enough to make sure you lose money. It's hard for them to successfully do this to people with more money, so you are their prime prey because you are the one they can psychologically manipulate by using how little money you have to restrict your choices and make you desperate. You will never beat FOMO in 2021, you're literally up against supercomputers that have spent years practicing their ability to predict and exploit your human fears.

But commodities, unlike stonks, don't give a shit about your $1000 in options contracts. You're not the prime prey of a commodity trader, their prime prey is a rich dumbass who will overpay bigly for a commodity future contract. With commodities you can bet on which way the price will go the next day and then stuff will play out based on actual market factors you had the chance to analyze instead of just literally looking at what you did and going against it. This includes commodity stocks like gold ETFs, by "stonks" vs "commodities" I more just mean corporations with complex speculative voodoo shit going on in their price vs straight up material costs where the only surprises are unexpected changes to supply or unexpected changes to demand, no crazy voodoo shit. 

I've been playing gold lately, but you just have to find commodities you instinctively understand. There might be stonks like that too, certain tickers you're just mentally in tune with, just be very careful with them because they will still try to prey on you and try to learn how to beat you because that's their evolutionary specialty even if your specialty is beating them.
Analyzing the chart it seems you are going to loose 56% of your portfolio before breaking out to new highs again.

The irrational exuberance I’m talking about is how people here jerk this company off and treat it like gods gift to investors. Has little to nothing to do with your opinion of valuation, has more to do with this company future vs the other hundreds of high growth/potential tickers out there. It’s a cute and fun story, made and lost a lot of money for people here but that doesn’t change the fact this stock is pumped to the hilt like a broke gas station attendant.
I'm in the Air Force and I'm retarded. Hence why I'm in the thread.

Straight up no.

Your brain isn’t done developing till you’re in your mid to late twenties

So the 3K is towards ordinary income like a job.

If you lost $13K in 2019 so you wrote it as capital loss. Wrote off the 3K in your tax return that still leaves you with $10K in loss. Now in 2020 let’s say you made $20K you can write off $3K in ordinary income and $7K towards your gains so you only pay taxes on 13K

Started the year at 100k, borrowed 200k via personal loans and went all in in Oil, travel and reits in March - April period. Sitting at 1.3M now.

It’s a life changing year for me. Not sold anything yet and not planning too. Diamond hands. I’ll be able to hit 2M if most of these stocks recover to pre-covid levels.

Once these levels are hit I’ll sell everything and buy a few condos and diversify stock holdings into global etfs like IWDA

At 1 point you lost almost 1.5 million in gains 😂
Thank you for all your congrats!  

For those who do not like to invest in TSLA, I recommend looking into ARKG.  IMO, it will do well for next 5 years so just buy and hold for 5 years and do not sell before then.  Good luck to everyone!
No. Might as well play scratch offs.

Thanks for your answer! Can you give me the math on this? Not because I don't believe you, but I just don't understand it lmao, all call/put explanations I've read seem to be very superficial

In my understanding if I buy 100 shares at $20 and then sell them at $40, it's $2k gains.

If I buy a call at $30 (is that how I should read 30c?) and it reaches $40 then it's $1k profits minus the premium.

This is how I see it in my head, but I probably have gotten the workings of calls fundamentally wrong, can you correct me here?

I only have about 1300$ edit: im 21
I see! Well to each their own I suppose. I bookmarked that video they posted because I have actually seen it thrown around a few times on my Facebook and Instagram today, so I’m wondering if it is actually worth watching, I think that lady in it was some kind of investment banker or something?

I’d say it’s bullshit but it makes me wonder why 1. They made that long ass post. And 2. Why others are talking about this and sharing it. 

Also, in regards to the word retard/Ed, I do appreciate your freedom of expression and speech. I have a mentally handicapped family member and I just feel it is important to share that the word is extremely derogatory and much better words can be used. I know this won’t matter to you, but it’s a small thing that might make someone else’s day just a little more positive!


Anyway, enough of me rambling. I hope you have a good one, watch out for them elites ;)

Stick to shares and learn your risk tolerance. When you can take emotion out of your trades, learn options, which can increase your leverage, but carry much greater risk. You’ll know when you’re ready.

My guidelines I plan to follow in 2021
1.  Invest in only a few innovative companies that I know in depth
2.  If I feel enough conviction, instead of investing in stocks, buy long term options instead
3.  Stay away from short term options as much as possible.  I always trend to lose money with short term options.  
4.  However, it's ok to allocate small portion for short term options too add some extra excitement into life.  😂

In 2020, the biggest positions comprised of TSLA options.  I currently hold over $3M in Tsla stock and options.  I want to continue with this strategy into 2021 and see what happens...

But since you asked...and since I'm such a good father...

You like Lego right son?
1 lego costs 1 dollar
You have 2 dollars
2 lego is kind of useless, right?
Why not buy a call option contract, for 2 dollars that can possibly buy you 100 lego 6 months from now,
If the price of lego goes down in 6 months, you lose your two dollars and receive nothing.
If the price of lego goes up in 6 months, and you do your chores like a good little boy, you can buy 100 lego at 1 dollar each even if the new price is 10 dollars per piece, or you can sell the contract for 10 dollars.  
Whatever you do, just don't leave those nasty little sole crushers on the stairs or Daddy is going to have to leave you and mommy forever and it will definitely be your fault.

Get ThinkorSwim, open a paper trading account, join in the WSB madness with fake money, figure out who to listen to and what options, credit spreads, SPACs, and margin are. Go read ARK invest articles and white papers. 

Realize you need to buy stock in growth stocks ASAP and 💎👐. Do so. Listen to Mama Cathie Wood and Papa Elon. Except on baby names. Though I guess he let's his girlfriend do what she wants, and that is the way. 

Watch Wolf of Wall Street at least once, internally substitute retards for cocksuckers. It will be really familiar. 

Then open a Schwab account and lose all your money on calls in style.
You dont belong here...
Correct. Think of it this way:
If I sell you 1 put contract with the strike price of 24, I'm giving you the option to sell me 100 shares at $24 per share ($2400 total). So when the transaction happens, I get the premium ($500) but if it's a covered call, the broker locks $2400 on my account so in case you decide to exercise your option there's enough funds in my account to buy the 100 shares from you.
Let's consider the extreme example that the price goes to 0. In that case I still have to buy 100 shares from you at $24 evenn though the options don't have any value. At the end, I'll lose $2400 minus the premium I received.
Amazing congratulations
I shall not be dishonored like this! ⚔️

Nah I ended it where I wanted to, but he gave me multiple replies like before. He even deleted one of his replies to my final comment, probably didn’t want to show how frustrated he was. 

But the truth is that I don’t care if I get heated in an exchange like that, conspiracy theorists are some of the biggest morons with even bigger egos. I’ve talked with a lot of them and it’s always the same bullshit so I don’t even try to meet them halfway anymore. I just tell them how it is and let them know how retarded they are and then end it.
How much market cap will an internet cafe have? Even if it is a chain... say 50k per store?
The majority of people I've met have heard your name, maybe a drunken story or two. Some even know your claims, your titles and all about what you may or may not have done or said. Few doubt that you ever existed. Most reject the Holy Bible, and that's okay.

I'm happy that you've had your birthday. Being born means a lot! I was also born once and will also die once. Thank you for that.

Besides what the other person said (read Morbius first): it's low risk low reward. You make like 30-100$ a week on a 1-3K investment, or you lose money because the underlying stock is losing its value. But at least you're losing less money then when you were just holding stocks (and even less money then when you were holding PLTR calls).

The idea is to get the cost basis of your 100 stocks down over time so that whatever the price is, you make a profit, even if it dips a bit. I bought PLTR for 24, sold covered calls for about a month now and earned (per 100 shares) about 300$. So even though the price is now below 24, I still make a profit if I were to sell right now (which I won't of course because diamond hands)
Short SPY if Trump wins? Bruh, the stock market loves riots. Nothing better for big companies than burning down local businesses.
Big boys use them when they are essentially forced to park some equity as cash or cash equivalent collateral for their debt. No one's getting hot and bothered over 1%/yr but if a company has to have $100m on hand at all times and they're allowed to park it in 10yr treasuries, it's nicer than having it sit in a "credit collateral: do not touch" checking account

Yeah. Only 4 billion dollars in revenue by the second quarter of 2020. I’m soooo sad they lost soooo much money and had to lay off all those workers practically LEACHING off their overlords. They should go ahead and file for bankruptcy they’re so broke! SMH. A Walmart in a very small rural town close to where I live had to be shut down for making a measly 2 Million in profits this year. Those minimum wage workers should just work harder! So lazy. Why weren’t they able to squeeze more money out of their broke and struggling community last year?!

Check open interest (or volume, I honestly don't know what I'm talking about) [over here](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/GME/options?p=GME) it should give you an indication though. Some of those pump and dump schemes had open interest of like... 50, that's how you know it's fake as fuck.

I didnt say military strength. I said MIC. If the MIC weren't so anticompetitive, we'd have a lot more money and be much more efficient at building rockets. The MIC is like the college loan bullshit; everything is inflated because the government won't shop. 

Instead we're paying a contractor 180/hr to pay a contractor 120/ hr to pay a contractor 80/ hour to certify something is secure. That's *stupid*.

On the other hand, it's a great job where you get paid a lot to do not much as importantly as possible.  Yes, that opinion is borne of experience.
As a PLTR holder I took the most popular put strikes of 24, 25 and 27 as being very bullish.

The running speed starts slowly, but gets faster each minute after you hear this signal. [beep] A single lap should be completed each time you hear this sound. [ding] Remember to run in a straight line, and run as long as possible. The second time you fail to complete a lap before the sound, your test is over. The test will begin on the word start.

My board game group a few years ago was playing by the book, and of course you know about halfway in who's going to win at that point. 
 We also noticed nothing in the rules forbids freely giving property and money as long as you're trading with the active player, so we collectivized our property and bankrolls to make sure the 2nd, 3rd, and 4th place players at the table could survive, and tried to beat the 1st place monopolist.

We spent the rest of the game in jail (hilarious luck of the draws and rolls) and it's the most fun I've had playing a board game.

Eh too many bears shorting actually good companies that may be overvalued a bit but are nothing in comparison to obvious ponzi schemes.  Burry was early in 07 and he is already early this time around.  If i had to give a prediction I'd say 2-3 months before rug pull, but EVERYONE needs to unanimously be a bull before that happens.  Too many "but Biden will raise taxes" or "weakening dollar" mofos.  Every last boomer retirement account needs to be squeegeed to its final penny.

Thats exactly why I went all in at like 9.30 a share. Then when it jumped to 9.80 I woke up in the morning after having a dream that the market crashed and sold out.

There’s a parallel universe where Jim Cramer and mad money only exist in the Seinfeld universe.
Lol, not even close. You think individuals have actual power? Hell no. Money is the only thing that has power in politics, and robotaxis are worth an utter fuckton of money. And Teslas are owned by rich or upper middle class people who are all thrilled at the idea of making money on their couch. 

Broke uber drivers aren't going to be a road bump. Uber will just try to buy Teslas. 

Now, Truckers. That may be difficult. But after cars, not all that difficult. And you know China is going to be all over that shit faster than you can say gene engineered babies.

Jesus fuck. Did you do that yourself ?

Also how are you so skinny fat?
Games still take forever with the real rules.
Unless things have changed there was a 300m repurchase approved. Only 60m of which was actually executed. 240m still remains. Burry was hounding the board hard earlier this year to execute the last 237M. It would have reduced the float by 80% at the time. 

Of course a buy back would be much less effective now since GME was only worth 290m at the time and is over 4x that now.
Nah I told him my two rules: don’t touch my mama, don’t touch my Doritos.
While I’m not exactly an expert at monopoly, isn’t this kind of a moot point?

You’re not looking to maximize ROI, you’re trying to hit a breakpoint (having prices high enough to bankrupt people).

So if someone has $4k, and your hotels cost $4.5k, it would be better to build a hotel than 3 houses, despite the ROI. This becomes more important when the player has houses of their own, the money you save from forcing them to sell their houses is much better than the ROI of 3 houses.
Nah I can see right through your deflective/defensive comments. I’ve talked with a lot of conspiracy theorists and y’all all act the same when backed into a corner. You start to direct your comments towards my social life, hoping I have some insecurity that you can trigger to make me fuck off. But there isn’t any, I have a degree in aerospace engineering, I’m taking a post-grad class in data science and business analytics, and I’m currently in bed next to my girlfriend of 4 years. 

Here’s the thing: you were the one that posted the conspiratorial bullshit and opened yourself up to debate. If it’s too much for you to handle then maybe keep it to yourself. Or ideally, think critically of your own beliefs and maybe do some research on whether they hold water. 

But I will always go all-in against conspiracy theorists because y’all act so arrogant until someone actually whips some reality out and lays it out in front of you. Peace out bitch, and keep your stupid posts in /r/conspiracy, not wsb

Some people perpetually surrender all their leverage and place themselves in the mercy of others. Sustain your financial and emotional independence and you can start making choices based on opportunity instead of desperation. Opportunity arrives more often when success isn't the only option.

Consider this: 

They operate in a market that is increasingly digital. The digital products are sold through monopolized markets via Microsoft’s Xbox Store, Sony’s PSN Store, or Nintendo’s eShop. I’ve left out PC because PC games aren’t even physical anymore. That leaves physical hardware sales and low volume merchandise. 

Both Sony and Microsoft have begun to engage in direct sales. GME’s competitors are larger, have higher reliability and better inventory (Amazon, Target, Best Buy). Their competitors can draw in sales from people visiting for unrelated reasons. 

That leaves low volume merchandise like FunkoPops, branded plushies, and other nonsense. 

They have no competitive advantage and their outlook is bleak. It doesn’t take reading their yearly statements to figure that out. Invest at your own risk.
I want a new rolls Royce, someone give me one
Alright, I'll bite.  I don't have a concrete opinion on much of anything really, but here's my questions regarding the 'great reset' the illuminati and the 'NWO'.  I do not claim to know much of anything, so please bear with me.

First, evil is, well evil.  Loyalty, is not thought to be an attribute of evil.  As one of many examples, Hitler's inner circle had a lot of back-stabing and deceit within it, especially so as their chances of winning diminished.  How will the elite stick together and not let their greed for power destroy their highly coordinated team effort.  Wouldn't they all be watering at the chops for the first opportunity to eliminate a member of their own team?

Second, how much better are the Elite planning on having it?  It seems to me, that the sums of money they already have would set them up nicely for many generations.  We are already slaves in a lot of ways, and as the system has it, it has found a good  balance.  We work our asses off, but feel like we have some control in our destinies.  We still feel like, we have a chance which allows for us to be much more productive.  Why, if the elite are all on a team, would they risk this?  The only difference between today and the years of slavery, is we don't see the hand holding the whip anymore.  Would they really want to risk that, to make their world 10 percent better?

Lastly, if it is all true, what you are saying.  What can we actually do to stop it?  Seems that, if true, we are centuries late and way too easily divided to ever muster much of a retaliation.  Could it be, that there isn't one force at play here, but many complicated layers upon layers?  A complete mess that you nor I probably won't be decoding by watching a Youtube video readily available for us peasants to watch.
Are these trends we are seeing proof of a super-group looking to put us in chains, or are they merely consequences of our collective greed, our free-economy that places dollars over ethics, or job titles and social constructs of success over family connectivity.

I wish I knew something that could help us, but the real problem I see more than anything, is that we divide ourselves anyway we can.  I believe the people do hold the 'power', and that is why we aren't headed anywhere we want to be.  Until we are all able to find ways to unite, rather than divide, it is not realistic to expect an outcome any better than grey skies.

I hope you can keep these worries at bay, and spend quality time with your daughter.  That will most-likely be the best investment you can make.  I am with you, and I respect your courage that's in your heart.  I just don't feel like a couple pebbles will be enough to derail the train, and until we can all agree on one thing, I don't see much changing.
I lost a few hundred on PLTR calls this week. But PSTH also mooned so I made a killing off of that but it's unrealized gains.

Frankly I have crappy internet, and prefer buying the physical disc. Even so doesn't really help because there is always a lengthy update that needs to be downloaded as soon as you install. Thus it still takes 5+ hours to be able to play a new game.
      The entire gamestop franchise was built on pre-owned sales and needs a major pivot.  Physical games are mostly a nostalgia thing at this point, the only real benefit is that you can resell them....

Disappointed in you my man
This type of reply that makes me want buy Iron Condors
It’s not a real rule. But yes, tons of people play that way.

The most common version of the house rule seems to be:
Throw $500 in the middle of the board. Anyone landing on free parking gets the $500, plus whatever else is in the middle. (Some families then replace the $500 with ANOTHER $500. Others only throw the $500 in the first time, and some don’t seed the middle with anything, only throwing in tax/fee/etc)

Also throw luxury tax, property tax, building tax, income tax and anything else that is a tax, fee, etc (from chance/community chest cards) into the middle.

(Some families only use stuff that expressly says the word tax, and are very expressive about it. And thus, hospital FEE, doctors FEE, and school FEE aren’t included. I’ve actually gotten that lecture TWICE!)

People also seem split on if paying $50 to get out of jail should go to the middle or to the bank.

When you try to show them that none of that bullshit is in the rules, most of them reply that they’re playing by the rules from the 80’s/70’s/60’s/50’s edition, and that they must have changed sometime since then....
Clearly you have a microcock. No one else would go out of the way to proclaim how large their dong was than a teeny tiny sissy boy.
The US literally fucked over the country of Iran completely just to get a profit out of it... I hate human greed

Oh jesus, no. I live here near DC, and... no. Shenandoah gets no cell phone service, the weather sucks, lots of political bullshit - Charlottesville, statues, idiots with AR15s, idiots throwing shit at the police. And it has taxes but few amenities. No Medicaid expansion, so poors are fucked. 

Go to West Virginia. Prettier, cell phone service, really fucking cheap. Weather is still stupid, but its prettier. Less farms more mountains.

Theres Portofinos going for pretty good prices since Roma is replacing it, thats probably a good starter ferrari either that or you can go vintage and get a 456gta which has the hot 90’s styling but its also automatic so easy to drive daily

You should just hold if you don't need the money. PLTR is a solid stock with huge upside. A small dip after the insane run up it's had is normal. I'd be more worried if it just kept mooning. People in this sub freak out on small dips because they're playing weeklies or way OTM monthly calls. Stocks don't expire
There's a lot more to Indian food than the usual stuff you find at the average Indian restaurant (mostly Punjabi I gather). I personally can't stand the Punjabi stuff, but really like Southern Indian food (rarer to find those restaurants).
Fucking Christ, Bro fuck out my replies already. I don’t fuck with you.
Yea let me give you the advice I give theta newbies

I bought MRO back in like April or something and sold weeklies on the way up

One week I sold $4.50 calls which were way OTM at the time. MRO proceeded to rip and almost touched $5

So I had to sell mine at $4.50 instead of keeping at $5. So yes I consider that a loss

Read up Tastytrade’s articles and watch their YouTube on how to do theta properly. I’m paraphrasing but the most profit and least risk comes from selling 30 delta and 45 days out and then closing at 21 days. Has to do with theta decaying the most with OTM options from 45-21. You make like 80% of the profit in that time frame. Then you just reopen the position again and it also gives time to roll up and out if something happens

Butchering it just read their shit
More like, there is no breaks in this TSLA, only pedal to the metal  🚀🚀 🚀🚀

Hey man. I don’t know Palantir so well but In general 8 times out of ten it’s better to hold on to the share until it goes up. The two times I lost on it was in oil and mining stocks.

The little I know about Palantir tell me you should keep them and not look at them for at least a year if you can be without the money for a while.

Here’s a good article on the good practice of not check your stocks to often.

Nobody need to hear that shit, say something useful
Maybe it’s just accounting trickery... in a prior quarter they put an expense on the books for upcoming store closing costs. Paying out lease obligations, employee severance etc. They may also go ahead and write off all the inventory in the store. 

Then the actual costs of doing the closing come out less than that number, and they do get paid by the liquidators for the going out of business sale proceeds. Then they can call this income to make up for declining numbers in a quarter.
It’s not, wider broadband allows more frequency. The frequency change is going to be the new grid for everything.

It is not just internet man, come on.
Its just because I bought it, all these years TSLA fomo payed off because I did not buy it.
Don’t listen to any of these other fuck boys. Would you buy PLTR today for $23.50? If the answer is yes, then hold. If you would be looking at something else, then sell. It’s that simple. 

In fact, you’ve got a loss, so you’re getting back MORE than 23.50 because of the tax write-off.

PLTR is a good long term hold unless you don't want to wait. CC will get your average down eventually if you're patient  the premiums are pretty good. 29.83 is pretty fuckin high average but it's not the worst stock to be 700 shares deep in, it has a good future outlook. Don't get scared by the retards saying it's gonna hit 18 they don't know shit it could just as easily hit 30 again

Yes, exactly. They already paid $500 (or whatever the premium was when they purchased thee puts).

Since this is a put option:
if price > 24 at expiration -> the option holder loses all the money invested ($500)
if price  < 19 -> the person makes profits of (19 - price)*100 per contract
if price between 19 and 24 -> person loses part of the $500

Are these your life savings? Are you able/willing to hold for a long time? If the answers are yes and no, you might want to consider setting a limit sell at 40/50 so that you don't lose, and just forgetting about them. I don't think PLTR is going bankrupt anytime soon, and stonks go up in the long run, so you'll make it out alive. It could take a few months, or few years, but it will happen eventually.

I'm with you. I literally don't see any long-term viability for GameStop. How long can they hold on, though? KMart held on for like a decade after it was no longer relevant. Sears is somehow still doing the same. JCPenney just came out of bankruptcy, but unlike Gamestop, they sell clothing, which does not sell as well online.

Long term, I predict Gamestop is bankrupt within the decade. But short term, with all these store closings and Xbox/PS5 consoles, they will probably enjoy a short reprieve from the death march.

But I guess this is why this is /r/wallstreetbets and not /r/investing

You’re obviously entrenched in conspiracy theories. There have been plenty of pandemics throughout history, and they killed tens and hundreds of millions of people. The fact that this virus has only killed a couple million, despite how poorly governments have handled it, just goes to show how much more we’ve advanced to handle these things. 

Here’s the reason we have shut downs. And be sure to read carefully because I can tell your brain works slowly. We have limited capacity for our hospitals throughout our country, if we let the virus run rampant, then we run out of capacity for people in critical emergencies like heart attacks and car accidents. 

The shut downs are to make sure that we can take care of everyone, it’s not a plan by “the elite” to destroy small business. It was a failure by the corrupt Trump admin to make sure that small businesses were adequately compensated to maintain their operations. 

Many things went wrong when it came to this virus, but don’t delude yourself into thinking it’s part of some “grand scheme”. The elite only have better means than the rest of us to take advantage of what’s happening, but they aren’t going to concoct some virus that will disrupt their ability to party and travel. It makes zero sense
Thank you bro

What are you tuned into here is a collective intelligence that cares about you
I lost all my money in 2018 and 2019 by constantly mistiming option plays in an effort to take advantage of the insane volatility caused by having a lunatic in the White House. I walked away from my IB account in disgust and forgot I had a handful of SNAP shares. I checked in again last week and they were up over $50, so I sold them for just enough scratch to buy a single Apple call, expiring March 21. This upcoming earnings report determines whether my trading career rises from the ashes or... goes back down into the ashes again. I mean, let's face it, the ashes is where it probably belongs. But maybe... JUST MAYBE...
Nah PLTR dawg
Aaaaand it’s gone
I don't hate america really. I just need a break man. This place is awesome but crazy as fuck. It's like the worlds greatest meme. And I'd rather watch it from afar than be a part of it.
Unlikely anything that is comfortable
in a 🌈🐻 or 🌈🐂 way?
Theta gang thanks you for your service.
I see. Does this means he already paid 500 for a 100 put option? I guess the premium increases the higher the strike price is? Else it would be easy and dumb.
When gme will be higher than 19 by 15 Jan, does the person only looses the premium if they let it expire?
Thanks for making things clear to a new trader
[deleted]
I need help.
It’s really weird for me, I work at a major securities Firm in IT and we can’t talk to each other about stocks or the market.  It could be considered insider trading, so while we all day trade because we don’t pay fees or commission, literally none of us can discuss it.
I had chicken sabaj recently. It was really good! The restaurant asked me how spicy I wanted it on a scale of 1 to 5 (the hottest). I picked 3. It was hot but not too bad. Definitely going for a 4 next time.
Not every stock is a gamble bro I hate when people say that but options are a gamble due to the time decay hence why I only play them during earnings because blue chips make the biggest moves during great earning

If you have no other money, sell at a loss so you don’t die.  If you have other money to stave off death, hold and it will be well above where you bought in.

Did you get it
So if you buy shares at $20, and sell a call for $40, the stock goes from 25-41, you must sell at $40. You would take the premium but also miss out on an additional $100 from agreeing to sell at $40? Is there really a way to lose on this, assuming you already own shares at anything less than the strike?
You got shares man no worries
Yes, sell your house and go all in on puts

much higher return with options yet higher risk. say it hits the high price target or $40 in june. with shares you’ll make 2x your money (rounded up). with a 30c june option you’ll make 8x. as long as ur confident in a play then the risk is worth the return

I know that was the response and bought the dip but I think Bloomberg is likely considering his legacy and the future of his company.  Will he sell to Bill Ackman? Probably not but if he was going to sell it to someone would it be Bill Ackman?

When recorded on a 13-F, call options are noted as the value of the underlying shares in the contracts, not the market value of the contracts, vastly skewing the number. In terms of investment size, GME is the largest.
Buy high, sell low. Sounds about right
I’m actually chill as fuck right now, homie.

Please look out for yourself. The next decade is going to be a lot.
I’m blown away by the people who own Tesla stock at this valuation. I’m sure 90% of fund managers hate having it in their portfolio. There is no dividend. Plus the run already has made people very rich, but only if they sell.
Well. They'll pay you the strike price. So you don't lose much. Unless you sell NTM Tesla calls. Sell puts on Tesla. Nicely OTM puts. Or just do a credit spread.
True. If you can’t make money off stock market in 2020, then stocks are not for you lol

Just hold onto it for a month or two.
this indian place by me makes pani puri and it is delicious and i havent seen it at another indian restaurant though
Bob and vagene.
Yeah basically. Buy and hold is better on stuff with dividends and stuff that's low IV. Selling CC works really well on high IV shit like PLTR unless it dips like crazy, but it's also scary if it goes up super quickly and you miss out on profit. I had to sell my PLTR leaps at 23 because it jumped so quickly and I didn't wanna buy back my CC and then I missed out on like 5k instead of just holding the leaps so there is downsides. Generally you want to sell CC on big green days and buy them back on dips or when hitting 40-70% profit there's no need to hold to expiration
Monopoly printer go brrrr
I’m def going to listen to a guy called “don’t touch my Doritos.”

So let me get this straight, I buy 100 shares of a stock, then sell one contract that's way way way OTM and I get to collect the premium. If the stock stays under the strike, i keep the money. If it doesn't, i keep the money but I lose my 100 shares?
Can there be a stag-pig
Because if he loses on puts, he’ll actually have to pay.
I’m not saying that he won’t but imagine if blockbuster was like we gotta do what Netflix does but since we make most of our money from late fees if we remove them what else do they have?!? Dude if GameStop stopped selling used games really that’s where their profits come from what are they gunna do? Sell used games online for digital download? Okay buddy good luck with that until their “new business model” makes sense to me I won’t buy a call.i don’t buy puts. If you wanna make money play options in Sony during earning that’s what I’ll be doing since cheap shit attracts you retards

It would be foolish for me to speak as though I have good knowledge on any of the vaccine's, but just from a basic point of view I agree, I really don't see how that Pfizer one keeps up with the others.

The other mega trends are a seemingly huge and never ending growth in gaming. And weirdly, a growth in physical media sales... enthusiasts are craving something physical.

Vinyl sales in music right now have **grown for the 14th consecutive year**, and they make for 17 percent of album sales in US - who the fuck would of called that in 2006?

The play with GME isn't "will it be the future of retail"... it's "will it survive and pivot to mostly online sales for the enthusiast market".

A good amount of people think they will, and along with their revenue, early debt payment, approx 260% growth in online sales combined with the cyclical boost from new console generation... then you just need to think if it's fairly valued or not.

Oh, and the short squoze theory.
every single person has a vice, every single person

don't let it get to you, but just remind yourself time and time again to eat sushi or something else
Check the posting history of the people bashing GME in that post about a mall store closing.

The elites have always had a plan.

Every generation of elites has benefited from decreased labor costs.

I expected this response and knew it was coming, to me if you’re not part of that group, why wouldn’t it be something to look into further.

You are blindly accepting a situation without any care that this could end up badly.

The pandemic just happened? To which extent was the lockdown that we are experiencing a proper way to handle this? Nothing else in modern history has been handled this way.

That doesn’t make you raise an eyebrow? Would you consider yourself able to think critically?
All I know is that they used to sell Wii Sports for like $10 when I could get $30 for that shit on eBay. So I’d buy every copy they had and sell it online for 3x as much. How someone can be bullish on a company that literally failed at a market they should be experts in I’ll never know.

Don't think it will be starlink, and realistically won't be stripe purely due to the current valuations of the companies as much as i would nut for either.
Since the market is closed 🐕 life.
I think about shit like that a lot too. It’s always some convenience that makes you give up a little freedom, add it all up and it makes me uncomfortable. It’s also weird that so many people cheer the shit on. Like getting chipped and eliminating paper money are things talked about more. 

The counter arguments are like YoUR CeLlPhone, like yeah bitch I can leave my phone and make transactions with paper money if I don’t want it showing up on statements. Shit I don’t even do anything illegal or have a reason to be afraid of being tracked. 
The thing is that if things got so bad it’d be harder to get around or out of the system.

I don't understand you cause I'm saying Cohen will boost this company. We are taking money from Melvin. Doesn't matter who Cohen is, only that he knows how to handle a business and so has chance at improving Gamestop once he gets on the board. He might have impact already

I agree that it is very unlikely but the fact that it is so early is why I think it might be possible. By spinning off Starlink and allowing Ackman to acquire a minority stake, Elon is able to keep SpaceX private, accelerate production of the satellites needed for global coverage, and still retain ownership of Starlink.
They also call dominos directly to order
Yea, and volume looks pretty high: there's probably 4 guys trading it back and forth.

Underrated reply
I don't know if it's Melvin, but it means someone thinks the price would be below 24 by the expiration date. The premium for that option is about $5. So if the price turns out to be 24-5=19 or lower, this person will make a profit.

Nothing in this world is planned. My biggest gripe with retard conspiracy theorists is that the belief that “everything is planned” simplifies the world. In reality, the world is filled with people that have their own goals, agendas, and dreams, oftentimes conflicting with other people’s aspirations. 

The pandemic wasn’t planned by anyone, it just happened. But some people used it to their advantage, and obviously small businesses got hurt bad by it. But don’t delude yourself by thinking that all the elite cooperate together to make this happen. Most of the elite are competing against each other, to get better political influence, to be richer. It’s not so simple

Got a bachelor in Chemical Engineering and in Industrial Engineering & Management. 

Smoked weed every day so don't remember much. 

I work now, if work were to be defined as: 

"sitting at a desk 40hrs a week, surrounded by boomers, explaining them how excel and PowerBI work"

My title is "Product Engineer", yet really all I do is make fights with my French manufacturer (whom I need to represent) about certifications and explosion guidelines. Arrogant bitches they are. 

Oh right, gained like 113% this year in boomer stonks, RDSA is my baby.

Yeah, I switched from pre med to engineering and dad basically stopped talking to me at that point.  When I eventually got my mba, that sealed the deal that I was a retard and possibly gay.....   

I'd say it waxed and wained, but displays of human strength have seemed to always exist.  Nothing really has changed in terms of the brain of humans for the past 10k years.  Only the context slightly with electricity and everything that comes with it.  There is a softness in American society now, I dont think schools even mandate kids play dodgeball anymore....  but I think that will wane too.  Soccer though does rank higher than football in some age groups and baseball is basically on its way out.
Am I really this much up to my fucking tits in a stock that can at best, if all goes well, double?

Depends on what you want to do in grad school. You spend a lot of your extra years in school instead of getting real world work experience.

For example, in software the salaries are the same for the following

- bachelor new grad w/ 1-2 year of experience
- masters new grad w/ 0 years of experience

Internships help, but this comparison is assuming equal everything except YoE and Degree level

Question: this must be one of the most telegraphed trades of 2020. Market makers, anyone with any interest whatsoever in GME must know what is going on. Guarantee there are some very smart people being paid to research and document every post and comment here.

May everyone have succes on his own path. But the run up was not on the debt beeing paid off. There was a crash even. The run up was cause Cohen increased his shares. And let him be the key to it's succes. And this key figure have been sending tweets last days in favor of Gamestop. So one can believe.

Wall of text incoming.

Traffic stops are needed and are probably the number one reason for preventing deaths just by having presence on the roads. (Example - people see police they slow down) Then number one causes of deaths here that aren’t related to some sort of illness is motor vehicle collisions that are related to speed, distracted driving, seat belt infractions and impaireds. Who is going to be dealing with impaired drivers? Lol

And if you look at the traffic stops that lead to deaths... just provide your documents, listen and have your day in court (isn’t that what they’re there for?) if you believe you were innocent of what you were given a citation for, you’re fine... however it doesn’t go that way, people start mouthing off, doing sketchy shit and resist arrest) I mean I’m no genius but given how the media has already vilified police, shouldn’t you just theoretically shut your mouth and listen? It’s worked for me and everyone I know in person. Not sure why people have such an issue over in the US.

Simple Traffic stops for speeding or other minor offences also lead to majority of all illegal firearms, sex trafficking, abductions, wanted fugitives and drugs being trafficked that get taken off the road.  Nobody cares about this or talks about this because they’re uneducated and don’t actually know what goes on in their closed doors, lol.

I also don’t think a social worker responding to a domestic incident is a great idea. An active in progress domestic involving a violent offender with a weapon that has beaten the shit out of their partner and children involved, not really sure how a social worker is remotely equipped to deal with that. They come in AFTER the police are there and have defused the situation. Every single call is different and fluid, can’t say they shouldn’t be going to each and every call, mental health crisis workers attend calls with police here if it’s required. Sending a social worker to a house alone is retarded with a mentally unstable individual. (They’ve been killed here doing so, (police and social worker)

And honestly, the issue is the social workers I work with will refuse to go to these calls alone anyway due to the danger factor and request police - the media won’t say shit about that. Can’t set a blanket statement for every call.

Less funding = less police due to lack of staff and increased population (political stunt of defunding) 

Imagine being a call taker and saying - Sorry sir/ma’am you’re going to have to wait while your partner beats you and your children and destroys all of your property because we have nobody available at this moment. Try to leave or lock your doors to keep yourself safe.

I swear the front page of reddit is just a cess pool of hating things now. Hating on Trump, Biden, Influencers, new movies and books, subs hating on men and women, a random post about hating kpop or justin bieber, anti vaxxers, vaxxers, religion, etc. etc. It's so fucking toxic. Ever since I stopped browsing popular/the front page and just stayed here I've become way less negative in my daily life. All of that negativity gets to you after a while
I feel you. People will almost always without failure disappoint you. Living for yourself and only giving part of yourself to those deserving is relieving.

this 45 min video https://youtu.be/C1-0XKYAZII Fucking terrifies me. I would have never finished watching a random video that was this long, but this one had my attention.

The basis is that the elite want slavery as it is the most profitable business and now that technology is available to be able to support this they are making moves in different industries to ensure no one notices the trap they are setting. The pandemic was means to destroy small business.


I am a high net worth individual but I am nowhere near considered elite and this is extremely concerning.

We all need to come together and start taking a step back and realizing what the fuck we are blindly walking into.

I just had a daughter and the only thing I want for her is to have a life she is able to enjoy and be able to be her own person and make her own decisions. To the elite we are parasites, fuel, and just a means of making their blood lines lives easier.

Why are you saying shit that everyone already knows. No shit they have to evolve, that's the hype we are playing heading into January as they announce that they are evolving. Also the run up wasn't even due to lowering debt, it had more to do with normie hype and then the addition of Cohen. Why do I see the same fucking bear thesis every GME post, you aren't saying anything that hasn't already been said you retard.

No, see, putting money in the middle and making free parking a win the lotto spot just recirculates the money and makes the game take forever. 

No money to buy property? It gets auctioned. The game plays MUCH faster using the actual rules, and while it’s a brutal representation of capitalism and has player elimination, it’s a much better game that way.

The truth is, most have little PPs, the rest are frauds with.

Keep your pp safe so you can gamble another day.

I've got shares too. Was thinking of selling some CC but I don't think it's worth it.

On the bright side, I think the lockup is getting priced in currently and there's not much downside left. IMO

Most people actually do play it wrong. The game is 10X faster with auctions (if you land on an unowned property but don't want to pay full price, it goes to the highest bidder), but most people don't do that even though it's in the official rules.  

When people talk about Monopoly taking hours to play, you can tell they're doing shit like putting additional money on the board, avoiding auctions, and the like that stretch the game out longer than it needs to be.

I can imagine the scrawny pimpled 20 year old WSB users who spams "💎 hands, shares for gay bears" sits there with his dead calls thinking to himself how much fucking money he lost
I need my PLTR calls to print so I can prove to my family that I'm not a sad pathetic loser. I'm fat, and have oily skin. I'm never had a girlfriend, but I've paid for sex with hookers. 

If my PLTR calls print, I'm gonna use the money to buy a pretty wife from Russia so I can feel better about my low self esteem.

Entire city is out of work and the Strip is dead, ain't nobody sweating this becoming LA.
I’d say their vast selection on older titles is unmatched when it comes to brick and mortar stores such as Walmart and Best Buy, although you can always find those games online.

I honestly don’t know why WSB is deciding to try and pump this dead retail store. Idk, I could be missing something, but coming from someone who has had a GameStop for a better part of their lives, this seems like a dying business.
What do you mean? Look at its shit holdings. Lmao
Same GE with like 8.75 billion float and 55 billion in debt? Sure

Not knowing exactly what they will do in the longer term isn’t super important to the current thesis. The short term is focused on next gen console excitement and gamers buying shit wherever it can be found. Whatever happens after the dust settles on that rush will be more clear eventually. Cohen is obviously exciting but not guaranteed. 

TLDR Market cap is just way too low for how much product they are going to move during console craze. BK was priced in

Priced in/overreaction imo. Lockup sells arent even gonna blip the chart, people are just giving me shares on sale cuz they’re scared of the lockup ending. Next
I saw people say "GME 🌕🚀🚀" then bought shares 3 seconds later. Now up 40%.
If you give me $500 I’ll turn it into $10K too. But you can’t withdraw until 2080

Nobody gives a shit about market caps in 2020.

One of those real doll robot ones?

Chicks will think you are a creep, but then they own 5 different magic wands, fifteen mythical beast dildos, six vibrators, two drilldos, a fucking machine and sybian,  a male torso fuck doll, and like 8 jeweled buttplugs.
Just to ask a follow up question, does that mean even if the price is less than $40 you can still make a profit because of the extrinsic value of the call? bc the call is still valueless at anything less than 40
What game should I buy I’m bored as fuck.

wait wait, retards. One important ass fact to prevent rope and thoughts of tax evasion - if you MAKE gains next year, you can still deduct whatever wasn't the 3k you didn't deduct this year. Forever, you get to deduct all your losses against your gains. That is, your losses will roll over. They were not for nothing.

PLTR has 3 catalysts coming up.

&#x200B;

1) 1/7/21   [https://www.washingtonpost.com/washington-post-live/2021/01/07/path-forward-combating-covid-19-with-palantir-ceo-alexander-karp/](https://www.washingtonpost.com/washington-post-live/2021/01/07/path-forward-combating-covid-19-with-palantir-ceo-alexander-karp/)

&#x200B;

2) 1/26/21 Demo Day   [https://palantir.events/livedemoday](https://palantir.events/livedemoday)

&#x200B;

3) 2/11/21 Earnings    [https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/pltr/earnings](https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks/pltr/earnings)

&#x200B;

Lockup ends   - 3rd trading day after earnings report for year ending 12/31/2020. 

What this means is the quarter ends on 12/31/20. the official results of that quarter will be reported to the world on 2/11/21 (approximately) .  3 days after that the lockup will end and 13.3 million shares would be able to be sold.  So we looking at 2/16/21?

[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm](https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1321655/000119312520257973/d89036dex991.htm)

&#x200B;

I would keep Feb and May. Those will print leading into earnings.  May should get you another earnings call. Jan contract is iffy. You are running low on time if it doesn't pop next week.

Don't do options if you're not ready. You can play GME with shares in the meantime. Read up and learn options trading while you're at it so you're ready for your next play after if ever.

Their huge retail footprint can also serve as fulfillment centers. 

1-2 weeks? They've recently introduced same day shipping in some areas.

Positive changes being made, and the huge short interest puts further upward pressure on the stock. Prime example of asymmetric risk imo, that's why I'm in this trade.

Pfizer’s vaccine will have its headlines as well trust me. There will be news wars to try to win over the public’s trust on which vaccines are safer but all it’s really going to do is scare the public. This will translate to a stalled rate of vaccination and prolong the time it takes to reach herd immunity benefits. Overall I think Pfizer will bear the brunt of bad news.

It's a literal award that you can only get/give in this subreddit.

If you look at the top of the thread as see all the awards, you'll figure out which it is.

Can’t forget triple platinum lol. Had to fix it.
The number I currently have in right now means next to nothing. What really matters is the percentage weight of my portfolio I am willing and am planning on putting into Palantir, which is 25%. I don’t only invest in one stock because I like to somewhat minimize my risk, but investing in more than a certain amount of stocks is retarded and gives you diminishing returns

I’m just starting in life and accumulating wealth over time. Its a process. I could lie about my position and tell you I have 10,000 shares if it makes you feel better.

I'm sorry, there's not "only VW e up" 

Did you miss the whole ID3 launch (540km range) last year? ID4 have already started deliveries.  Skoda Enyaq releasing this year. BMW iX3 releasing this year

Kia e-Niro and Hyundai Konas are fucking everywhere. 

It's not unusual to get in a Hyundai ioniq taxi. 

Go to Amsterdam and the majority of the taxi rank are Tesla Model S. 

This is without talking about the Audi e-Tron. The Taycan. The Polestar 2 (already seen a few of these in UK). The new all electric Volvo xc40. Peugeot e208. etc

VW has production capacity for 600,000 EVs in 2021

Thinking Nio has a free run at Europe like Tesla had is completely missing what the rest of the auto industry is doing. 

This doesn't mean Nio can't succeed, I just worry about shit DD like this as it's like you don't have a clue what's actually going on.

Actually... non zero chance of being a winner. All it needs to do is avoid bankruptcy and the stock will rocket when there's no more social distancing.
Because Ryan Cohen is an active investor not a passive one that'll just tuck tail and leave.
I prefer offering strippers extra money for sex. Hookers are sad. I usually go up to one I like and ask for a dance and then after I get there instagram. Then I DM them that night so they remember me. They usually have to set something up with a babysitter so I have to wait like a week but 20 year old stripper pussy is bomb.
WSB history in the making
Bold of you to assume that people on this sub like making money
Ok, we used to give more awards, but 3 fuck boys and 3 ternions we did not. Hats off.
>PS because I bought those for the very long term and because at the very least I should hold them until March to hit the long term capital gains tax rate.

cant wait for apple to hit market cap of $4b
More gold? Why just not spend on hookers.
Cheers to that
Sheeeesh that would be amazing but imo itll prob jump to like the mid 140s until theres some more news
It would also mean more capital gain taxes.  Also, more stimulus means rates will go higher and the "TINA" argument falls apart. Also, this would lead to a red hot economy, meaning higher inflation and more chances of FED increasing rates which means valuation of growth stocks has to come down.  In general, value stocks will gain more if Dems get a clean sweep.

Found you nice job with the fuckboys good luck getting your flair
so you lost money then
Oic ok yeah fair enough. I think we got stuff lined up for Jan tho, and rmo is partnered with workhorse so if they get their deal with ups should be good for the stock. I only found out about qs a couple weeks ago so I can’t really compare
It doesn’t really. There are certain things about to hit certain big milestones even...like 30k

It's not really a conspiracy if it can be easily verified.

It’s overvalued. Think about it like Apple. Imagine if 10 other companies provided the same exact product and service as the other. How would one take more market share? Price point would be the only thing that could be different. Covid vaccine will have little no no profit

I don’t think I can buy FOOD with my brokerage account. I think it’s listed in the Toronto Stock Exchange, but I will check.
It would've been fine when it was in the $400 range mainly because it was basically flat for over 2 months. Where it's at now, the risk/reward just isn't appealing. 

Could it run another 30-50% from here? Maybe, but there are plenty of stocks that could do that and aren't overextended.
I needed to buy my roomie a Christmas gift, he got a switch a couple weeks earlier and I couldn’t get a controller shipped to the house before Christmas. Stopped into GameStop and picked one up and was able to use it that night to kick his ass in super smash.

Seems really unlikely. Starlink is supposed to be part of what funds SpaceX, why spin it off so incredibly early? There is no discrepancy in Elon's remarks, he wasn't thinking about Starlink at all in March, months later he's thought about it and thinks an IPO is for a few years later.
The only reason you see him with it so much is because he owns a ton of shares of the company so anytime he has public appearance he makes sure coke gets some spotlight

Hopefully a different stock will win . Otherwise, I’ll have to hold the hot potato for at least a week. Hopefully it wont get delisted. Next time Ill add to the conditions that the company needs an Altman Z-score of at least 1.8 to guide the poll to the intended goal of serious submissions.

If you are bag holding shares you sell CCs to offset your cost. 
If you are still waiting for a good price drop to get back in you still puts and collect premium until you finally get assigned back in.
is the house paid off? arent you also making the appreciation on a leveraged asset? if you put 20% down on a $500k house. thats $100k of capital with a $$500k asset that is appreciating. So if house appreciates 5%, that is $25k gain on $100k capital which would be 25%.  no real estate guy but always saw it kind of similar to buying stock with margin.

The advertising bubble makes the EV bubble look rational in comparison. Proctor and Gamble cut about 200 million from it's online advertising budget a couple of years ago, and had no subsequent decline in revenue. Once the other big corporations wake up to the shitty ROI they are getting for these FB and GOOG ads, there will be an ugly bed pooping.

Maybe a bit off topic, but does that criticism section look like it was written by the company to anyone else? There's no criticism, just things they've done to improve.

Actually, until you get to the covid section (which seems legit), there are barely any citations. It looks almost as if gamestop deleted all the criticism and just posted what boils down to replies.
Every award this post gets is a Jan 08 GME 20C I’ll buy.

Theyre going hard on marketing to newbie/first time buyers, usually porsche owners who want to upgrade to the next level.

They lock you into an upgrade path where you start used or entry level new and then work your way up to the special editions and flagships after establishing a history of 3-4 deals with them

Oh absolutely! I have no doubt NIO will rise much, much higher over time. I’m just wondering if it’s gonna make a small jump for NIO day because that’s what I’m betting on atm. I have leap calls for BABA. Currently I’m playing 1-2 month calls on TSLA and NIO with recent news that’s coming out soon. My fingers are crossed!
Lmao
Puts on awards?
PSTH, thank me later
I did the exact same thing. Except OTM calls and lost 20%. Gains would have been 7m.
you need at least $500. How close are you to that?

I wouldn't short TSLA but at its current price, I wouldn't buy it either.
I remember them making fun of me cuz this guy  was giving a 16 yo advice and said he should stick to some s&p etf and spend his time studying instead of trading and I said he doesn’t have to just study he can trade stocks too I brought up the fact that I have good grades and do stocks and I am 14 and they roasted me.

Undercut steam and epic's publishing costs, and steal the customers. 

Also if they created an actually good user experience with the interface, so many people would just leave steam. Both steam and epic's UI are straight trash, and people only use it because they have to. 

Create something useful, and people will flock to it. Undercut publishing, and game devs will flock to it. 

Literally just numbers.

That's why they said Amazon. Also, the market is quickly killing the idea of used games. The digital games markets and "arcade subscription" models where you pay for a catalog of available games are going to make more and more people stop buying physical copies of games. They will not go away completely for a long time, I think, but they will diminish enough to cut pretty deep into GME's profitability.
a guy meets his buddy at a bar wearing the brand new shirt his wife got him for xmas. he then proceeds to get shit-faced and throws up on his new shirt. "oh shit, my wife's gonna fucking kill me! she just gave me this shirt!" his buddy says, "don't worry. just put a 10 spot in your shirt pocket and tell your wife a drunk puked on you and gave u money for dry cleaning." "perfect!" says the guy and goes home. his wife meets him at the door and sees the puke stained shirt.."what the fuck??" "it wasn't my fault", says the guy, "some drunk at the bar threw up on me, but gave me $10 for dry cleaning". the wife then reaches into the pocket to pull out the money "then why is their 20 dollars here?" the guy looks at her and says, "oh yeah, he also shit my pants"

Oh no! I am going to paper hands my gme! I desperately need confirmation bias.

For those of you who said gme has no room to growth on online sales as they compete with Amazon, I see it the other way. Amazon has such a big third party network that you dont know anymore who you are buying from, and get no customer experience, it just gets the job done. Period.

For gme is easy to compete and win, just get some exclusive deals with sony microsoft and nintendo, membership rewards/prime subscription, use stores as delivery address, 1 day or same day shipping for sales and even renting videogames (they could deliver and pick up from your home) get into new products and service lines (esports), create exclusive bundles of products (like pc + corsair + videogames ...)

You dont have to be a rocket scientist to turn around this company.
Lmao
Bloomberg, Stripe, and Airbnb were early hype suggestions that have all been 100% ruled out as targets. I guess Starlink is possible but I find it unlikely with Musk's profile that he'd do a spac, I would expect an IPO - probably not a direct listing because they haven't finished changing the rules so direct listings can raise capital at launch yet.
They keep the special race track tires cuz they cost like 50k and don’t really work on regular roads u can use them if you take it to the track

Terrible analogy. I’m not a GME hater btw, I’m very neutral and don’t care for or follow that stock.

DASH works as a middle man because they’re bringing food to you. GME as the middle man still requires you to go to the store, when most of the time you can buy the games online. I mean, even GME CEO wants to push for online sales because he knows that is the way. GME can still be a successful company by utilizing their branding and pre-existing partnerships. But they need to revamp their business model, because in store retail is dying.
Holy shit you actually did wtf lol

You'll be making bank within ten years. As a former Molecular Biology major I regret not going the optometry route.  The debt scared the hell out of me.  Anyways, Try to not work in an oversaturated market.  My friend was making 90k in Chicago as an optometrist.  Just moved to knoxville and got an offer (and job) for 150k.  Lower cost of living, no state taxes, low property taxes = massive pay increase in every way possible.   Also look into buying a practice once you get some experience.   You can make some serious cash (300k plus).  Goodluck dude.

What is reddit gold? Been here for like over five years still have no idea.
Most are like 20ish APR, I didn't know APR meant Annual Percent Rate, as in 20ish percent a year.  It's all in the fine print, different rates for different things, but its all annualized.  

So lol yeah
Someone didn’t do their DD (this is a bull flag$)
People were waiting *11 years* to buy the dip, it just happened 9 months ago, and bears don’t think that the market is going to continue going up. 

Y’all are fucking mental.
Pretty sure it’s major service and conditionally only the drive train.
Dude are serious? Why do you guys give such importance to their words of Cohen, burry and Cathy Woods which are all great investors but they are wrong sometimes and they know how to manage their risk you just don’t hear about it cuz their losses are soo small compared to their gains dude listen to these people, do the research to back up what they are saying and ask yourselves am I truly comfortable putting my money into something I have no idea how it’s working out.. if you can’t explain it to a 15 year old and he don’t automatically think money then don’t yolo your money away on hope that’s all I’m saying

>GameStop.Com will revenue >2x their entire market cap in ONE quarter.

This is some hardcore shilling. Because that revenue doesn't represent growth, it is a one time thing from next gen console sales. After that gamestop is done. And this q4 earnings report you're banking on, would be funny if it is already priced into the share, and it's looking like it is. Share priced doubled with gamestop doing absolutely nothing.
PSTH GANG lets gooooo starlink or Stripe or chik fil a
Shit yeah. People grind 40+ hours a week for 30+ years. They don't know what to do with time after. Big in technical professions for sure. It's why a lot of retirees keep working part-time or consult. They can't let go.

not tires - brakes/oil/anything else for the most part.
It wouldn't be nearly as substantial. My reasoning is mostly based on the board of PSTH, the type of investments Ackman's made in the past, better fit of the acquisition criteria, and random factors like his relationship with Michael Bloomberg.

Hey guys, thanks for getting me through a rough time. I used the stock market the past 7 months as sort of a step-down addiction. Anytime I wanted to relapse, I did some stock research or invested some money. It helped me build willpower and entertain me and keep me away from my issues. I had about $2,000 to work with, and over those seven months I am now withdrawing $2,700. I bought myself a nice pair of boots, some takeout and other wardrobe updates.

Deleted all my apps and now I'm going to get back into playing guitar, working out and raising a dog. Thanks again everyone, good luck out there.

EDIT: Holy shit thank you for the platinum that was so nice!!! I'm overwhelmed, thank you!

EDIT 2: honestly I'm going to miss this community. Thank you for the gold and all the awards. One of the things that really made me keep going a lot was seeing everyone give so much money to charity and food banks. That really inspired me.
Oh shit he’s getting them 😂😂😂😂 time for a ternion

My RH recap showed I looked at GME over 7000 times.  I started back in Sept when GME was ~$9.  

It's safe to say I'm also obsessed about this too.  My all time chart literally looks like GME price movement since Sept.
What can I say? I'm a team player. Had to take the D for the team.
Thank you I’m trying to be out for this trading year not back behind bars even tho I made 35 the year I was locked up (2019) lost all my profits in March and got all that shit back and then some 😏 amd Apple and Tesla were the moves this year
What’s her number tho
Remember the movie Margin Call that depicted the great recession?

If they make a movie about 2020 and the March crash, I wonder if we will be in it. Hoodies lead V shape recovery.
That's not all you have to do with a vacuum

Downvoting because that’s what we do when you talk shit on GME.
Yeah I like gme thesis as a cash cow, diligent harvest, drastic undervalue for that path if done competently. That’s why burry was in. But this Cohen stuff that it should pivot and be a growth stock makes a lot less sense to me.

The burry path is what you want Mgmt in a declining industry to do - max profits and return money to shareholders. Cohens is burn the money and expand. Not appropriate.

This dude will need another Tesla now. Sales are going up = stonk is going up
Here's the problem: I want to buy PLTR and hold for a long ass time. This is a thinking about getting in TSLA at IPO. But I need to buy in with numbers and not my usual amount. For which I need to cheat on pltr to get a bigger stake in equity. 

This is the same argument I used on my wife and it did not work, but I feel like this has better odds at success.
Dumdum, sears refused to have anything to do with e commerce. The wrinkly old fucks wouldn't change. 

Adapt or fail, that's all there is to everything in the world.

Name for me 5 companies more famous for their website than their physical stores. Name for me 5 companies that successfully established themselves as an online only presence after Amazon stole the show. If you aren't out Amazoning Amazon (tip: they aren't and won't), or don't have a strong driver for your physical locations (pretty much just used sales for GME), then you are going to fail in retail. It's just a known truth.
Still waiting to know the percentage :)

Epic is tremendously better positioned strategically to do it, and financially too, and is struggling. CD projekt red also is and failed entirely. Microsoft also tried and failed. Steam so dominant.
My fingers hurt but I got into a good rhythm after a bit
I think it has more to do with the fact that interest rates are zero. Everyone has access to cheap money, both corporations and investors. It's typical of this type of environment where no one wants to own bonds and everyone crowds into equities.

30k is alot of money for me. Saved that amount over 3 years of working hard. Said fuck it in march and invested all of it. Had been doing some research and learning the mechanics before hand. Turned the 30k into 60k sold a good portion and bought PLTR and have been avging down with the dips. End of year holds are 1k Cresco shares at 5.40 cnd. 1116 PLTR at 26.20 and 100 NET at 40 and change.  Those are all in my TFSA . Long holds. Feels good to have 1k shares locked in.


TLDR 30k invested march 55k Jan1.

Idk imo one of the biggest appeals of gamestop was the actual stores. Without them they aren't any different than any other Amazon gaming seller. And at least with the Amazon e-commerce stores you can get free two day shipping. Don't know why anyone would order from gamestop to have pay a shipping cost and have to wait 1-2 weeks.
Relax, I’m trying to help people. Its a real cryptocurrency and its easily manipulated by average day people.

So according to several news sources, retail returns beat hedge funds and private equity in 2020. 

Well who didn't see that coming? WSB has more analysts than any financial institutions (1.8m strong) working for free and (therefore zero conflicts of interest), creating some of the finest DD of all time. 

In summary, GME, NIO, TSLA, QS, APHA, BABA, XPEV, PLTR, LAZR 🚀🚀🚀

Definitely finna beat them again in 2021.

Calls on WSB.

HNY WSB and good luck to all in 2021.

It was a 10 year Study, 2007 to 2017... So clearly you're able to read. But your article is from 2020 so that is definitely better to go off of. However it still states, right in the title even "Many still left behind" And if you read through it a bit it is clearly showing there are still millions of people with shit internet. So thanks I guess.

That’s definitely true, the first two hours of an acid trip are hellish to get through, but once you do you’re chilling the rest of the day. But last time I took shrooms they took hold of my nervous system and I was going from feeling hot to could in an instant, could feel like electricity and pain shooting through my body. Honestly thought I could be dying, luckily my friends just took me home and I cuddled with my gf until I felt normal again

I should have seen this coming. If it wins, I will keep my word. For as long as it's US-listed (and can buy in ML), I will buy it and post proof. However, I think there is value if people post tickers they believe in; maybe we can all rely later on the crowd's wisdom. A similar Twitter experiment beat S&P in 2020 by more than 13% (but the fund polled predefined stocks). Can WSB do better?
I admire your commitment to the cause
As this (and the other parts of OP post) are public knowledge, what is the reason for believing this is not already priced in? It's not uncommon to see a stock price dump even when a stock beats earnings if the stock price prior to earnings implies even better earnings.

No but that would be the opposite. The medusa theory is a hypothetical theory I came up with to categorize people who have shit Luck when it comes to buying a position . So if someone with the medusa touch buys à postion thé share price will plummet. I guess the Midas touch can be when someone buys the share price and it rockets.

I like it. I have 5% of my net worth in MSFT LEAPs as well. You’re likely going to have a great year. If I’m right about the Apple ER, you may even want to consider exiting some Apple at that time and moving some of it into more MSFT. I have a feeling Apple will be pretty fully valued at that point and if MSFT doesn’t have a similar jump by then it might be the better play for the remainder of the year.
I jumped in laaaate. My avg is 2.71 @15,000 shares. And yes,  YOLO. I'm up 47% 🤲💎🌙🚀

this is pretty fucking bullish long term.  u got a person that knows PLTR capabilities. could see some major contracts next 12-24 months. buy shares or leaps and shit is gonna print.

I say this as someone who bought gamestop at $4.30/share and told everyone it would go up when everyone was calling me a moron and that bankruptcy was imminent,

Holding gamestop for anything more than a short term swing play is moronic. This company is absolutely doomed to fail long term. I have faith in Reggie Fils-aime keeping the company alive for a little while after he joined the board, but the very premise of this business is suffering a rapid death.

How can you be bullish on retail store for physical games when physical games likely won't even exist next console generation? All of the major video game console manufacturers have been easing people into a digital-only era for a decade now, and the PS5/XSX both offering digital-only versions is the nail in the coffins. Next gen won't even offer a physical version.

That's different equation entirely. Tech startups get a chunk of investor money because they had a cute idea and blow through those millions to either explode in popularity or failure as fast as possible. If they fail they just have another cute idea and move on to the next investors.

Gamestop is hemorrhaging their own money with no clear plan for success in a market that is quickly making their models irrelevant.

Yes
Yes but you also can't assume your area is representative of the general population. 
A study from 2007 - 2017 shown that the average internet connection in the United States is 18.75 Mbps... Now remember that Mbps is NOT MBps, so that download speed is likely to be maybe 2 in a good time frame. You're AVERAGE consumer isn't going to sit through 80GB download at that speed. Also keep in mind that's probably got a capped data deal too. because business.  

https://www.statista.com/statistics/616210/average-internet-connection-speed-in-the-us/#:~:text=The%20statistic%20shows%20the%20average,connection%20speed%20was%2018.75%20Mbps.
Big facts
Yeah, I guess. But I don't think GME is junk exactly, just that the pump going on for the last month has been very low effort and low quality and high volume. Compared to the usual wsb memes that tend to have some effort put into them to make us genuinely laugh. I'm just agreeing with the OG comment that these GME memes are crap and have been for a bit now. I just want to laugh while I gamble away my retirement. Is that too much to ask?
I think it’s doable. Let us pray

What the hell is Medusa Touch Theory?
You say this, but what is the inverse? That the insane movement of the stock upwards that clearly follows no logic other than artificially creating a short squeeze is priced into the share price, and that is somehow comforting for those that hold those shares? Which is all theoretical anyhow, a WSB ploy that may not even happen.

No way. People still buy physical games. Anyone that cares about video game preservation wants physical. Digital games can be taken away from you at any time.. You never really own them. You won't be able to boot up your ps5 in 30 years and play all your downloaded games. I buy digital  a lot but I also still buy physical if I really like a game. Or if I want to be able to sell it when I'm done with it.

They’ll of course need to open more stores at this rate to grow the steady revenue stream generated by closing stores.

If I recall correctly Nio is more expensive and bigger than the Tesla's, they could theoretically come out with a smaller cheaper car aiming to sway European markets but, I haven't read anything like that at all... So that's to say that your argument for Nio in Europe is actually True for Tesla 👍 who are already cheaper than Nio and as pointed out on the thread still trending to be cheaper. That's their whole point good and affordable. There are definitely high end Tesla Models but that's not what the company is about 😃

Ironically the high stock price may actually save the Company if they decide to dump a ton of shares as part of the shelf registration 

Only thing that can save the current shareholders is Cohen. They tried to sell the company in early 2019 and no one wanted to buy. Financials have gotten much worse since then. The actual company is dogshit - now it is just a game with the shares

I've always had a special loathing for this company's overpriced garbage and gay aesthetic, but one day I finally convinced myself to just hold my nose and buy some equity in this piece of shit hype train cuz it's all about making tendies, right, not about being a femmy fanboi. That day was September 1, 2020.
Real question; if my portfolio is up a couple grand overall, but I lost... say, $1000 in options throughout the year, will I get to deduct any of that as loses?

Since the amount I’m up is staying in shares, and the options are just gone-gone?
So how do they expect us to ever buy a house when it's growing in double digits per year and salary is stagnant?
Also wondering, if anyone knows.
Look at the year chart it's just returning back to its normal $50 range.

People are not going to GO TO gamestop's website to pre-order something, and the used game market is going to be hurt by a system that doesn't offer instant gratification (not even to mention the move towards digital goods). They are dying 100%. They just have no viable business model that competes with major brick & mortar retailers, Amazon, and digital game markets.

How did you manage to pick the small handful of stocks that haven’t gone up this year?!
Why not both?
If you don't know about something called volatility crush, read up on that. There's a bunch of other ways to lose money but most people learn about IV crush the hard way.  This is not specific to GME btw, just a free general tip if you are starting out. 

Also, what you want is not a call "number", it's a call "strike". 

If you make money on your first option trade, remember that 'the first one is free' and don't start to think you are competent, don't YOLO into a second trade where you will get raped.

It's as if the market maker have a list of first time traders and let you win the first time so they can trick you into going all in...

TBH on Thurs. I sold 10 1/15 $19 cash secured puts for $2.10 each. Freaking 10% of the share price. So long as it stays above $16.90 for the next two weeks I still profit. Options prices are blown out so much that there is a lot of potential to cash in here, so long as you can stomach the risk.

I actually lol every time a bear says “shady”. It reinforces my view that you have no idea what you’re talking about, no emotional control in convo or in investing, and most importantly that anything on wsb meaningful impacts a stock as big as psth. 

I am literally doing this for you, the people. My posting success and track record shows that. To call it pumping is nonsense. We could have a discussion about the ins and outs of tontine and when to sell or not or what could happen, but you aren’t into that. You just wanna piggyback on my success. You have produced nothing of value for this community. You create no lengthy original posts. You just attempt to snipe with comments. That’s fine, but you already know you made a mistake here and you’re digging in. That’s fine, and it’s predictable. It’s ultimately human behaviour. Happens all the time when people are wrong. And like I said, a long arduous dissenting post will get a few upvotes because it’s novel. But make no mistake, it doesn’t lend credibility to your bullshit, it’s just going to get you gitty tonight and pump your ego. You’re still incorrect at the end of the day. 

I can do this all night and all day. I make a special project out of your kind, boomer.
Almost every person I know in person who plays games has shit internet because they either live somewhere too far from a decent connection or they aren't willing to pay the cost of having good internet. We could sit here and talk about this all night but I'd rather not. I'm sticking with my point though, as long as there is shitty internet, there will be a demand for physical games. Even if you're internet is good, if you're metered and get close to your cap, guess you're waiting until next month to download that 80GB game unless you want to pay overcharge fees or get throttled.

Calls on platinum
I think Elon did believe it because he's got crazy expectations.  I on the other hand took the timeline with a grain of salt and just accepted that he's working on that but didn't really expect them this year.

I think in terms of functionality Elon has said that the cars will be trained up and capable of self driving multiple times by the end of this year.  I think that is possible seeing how the fsd beta currently is and then giving the AI another year to learn.  But the uncontrollable part is the regulatory side of things to allow this.  Then rolling out the software system to facilitate this should be straight forward.  My best guess is maybe 2 to 4 years from now?  But that's just a guess.
ever award your own comments?
Check out the review on my blog
> But it seems unreasonable to think this company sees the iceberg ahead and isn't steering to avoid it.

I'd like to think that, but their move to mostly turn their stores into selling overpriced weeaboo shit doesn't exactly inspire confidence. Their ability to get more consoles or exclusive deals on games doesn't mean shit considering that's not where their biggest profit margins are. 

Gamestop makes their money on arbitrage. They give you $1 for a game and turn around and sell it for $15. I can't imagine they're making much on those brand new consoles and they're definitely not getting $14 on a brand new game. With a bigger store they could buy/sell retro games - They missed the boat there on the big big arbitrage as unaware people turned in old cartridge games - some of which sell for >$100 on the used market.

I would be surprised to see Gamestop make it to the next console release unless Nintendo releases some kind of updates switch in the next year or two.

Well the future of game sales are online so the convenience of not having to wait or go anywhere is the clear advantage. Steam, XB and PS marketplaces. Very little need for a physical copy of a game. EA Access and Game Pass are just the beginning of the streaming services too. 

Buying a console is just going to come down to price and speed, but the selling of games is where the money is at IMO. I think you overestimate their brand recognition as a positive thing. Most gamers hate GameStop. They’ll offer you $3 for a game you paid $70 for a month before and then sell it to someone else for $40-50. They’ve become a meme in that world and it’s hard to win loyalty in that market, especially when it’s been lost. 

If they can get into the production of games, whether it be buying a studio, creating one, or something like that, then they’d be more enticing.

My bet is on slv calls, forgot about weed stonks tbh
> because I fundamentally do not care what you think, haha

It's not "what I think" - it's you spreading falsehoods and then saying what I posted is untrue yet you somehow cannot point out the details that are actually untrue. Instead you just refer people back to your bogus pump posts as if that's somehow supposed to explain what's factually wrong with what I said.

You could just stop now and admit that everything I said is true and you were wrong, or you could stop attacking me and trying to assign me nefarious motives and actually argue with what I said.  Either one is fine, but your current line of just attacking me and avoiding discussing PSTH is shady as fuck.
Shouldn’t they lean towards selling PC parts as one of their possible avenues? I’d buy my PC parts from gamestop if they went the route of helping people build their PC. They could do console sales, computer sales, and offer build services. I’d go to them instead of Newegg.

That’s just something I was thinking about. As a gamer I’d much rather go to the place that knows about games and gaming. Not Best Buy or other similar electronics stores. I know we could just order it all to our homes, but just my two cents. :)

First of all, they make a ton of money. They just havent been making a profit because they are rapidly expanding.. Amazon didnr make a profit for a very long time. SE isnt making a profit. You get my point? Once these companies stop rapidly expanding they pull in huge profits because their revenue is so high and they are top of their markets.

In your opinion how long will we have to sell our shares during the squeeze? Are we talking a drawn out 1-2 week process?
Ever gone triple platinum?
Dumbest reply to this get a golden fuck boi. I’m going to bed rn but I’ll be up early and reading comments, and I’ll award then.

Y’all are fucking retarded so give me some good shit.

Edit- awarded fuccboi, everyone else got golds so not too bad.

Thanks for the laughs I love this shithole

I wonder what he meant by "bankers"?
Dang good point..wish I knew how to make a bet that the stock will tank. Is it called a call? Can you do it with Robinhood or that other app?
It's just margin access
I’ve gotten 4 platinums tonight

Blockbuster cut all their dead weight and has 1 store left. Solid bull flag. I'm gonna buy deep OTM calls when market opens
momma likes to sit on the printers while they go brrrr
Your $133 call gives you the right to buy apple stock for $133. On expiration day if the stock is $140, your call will be worth $7, because you could use it to buy stock for $133 and immediately sell those shares on the market for $140. 

So if you sold the call on expiration day, you’d be selling it for $7. Your profit then would be $7 minus whatever you originally paid for the call.
We also aren’t talking about startups here, a lot of business rules don’t apply with them. Stop trying to find a technical way you’re right and just accept you’re retarded.
Picked up some on Thursday for February my guy
just keep refreshing this page and check the amount of golds on the actual thread , it was 11 a couple minutes ago now its 23 and counting lol

Wtf happened to wingstop
GME does need to improve and Cohen is there to guide them. I won't agrue against that, they have an uphill battle but it is very possible to succeed.

Your comment works both ways. I always see this comment. What does GME offer... What does the competition offer? What's my incentive to step into Wal-Mart or Bestbuy? I don't get free money each month from them. They don't provide Game Informer magazine. I can order something from Gamestop and have it delivered same day now. Tell me why Wal-Mart is a better shopping experience than Gamestop when I want to shop for gaming related purchases?

Plenty of room for GME to improve but to assume competitors as clear winners at this point is foolish and wrong. They have the brand recognition to be successful. Companies pivot all the time. This is just one of the most hated stocks in the world and people want to see it fail for some weird reason.

I understand their nuanced data integration platform and how it can basically sit on top of archaic systems that companies have and provide that layer for experimentation with models and integration of various kinds of data. But how does it revolutionize deployment exactly in your eyes? Genuinely curious, you sound like your in DS too.

What’s it smell like
this is it.
Yeah but WSB requires the account to be a month old. So either it was an ambitious person or group making burner accounts over a month ago, or it's one of those companies from India who already have tons of burner accounts that say they will post like 100 posts for $100 bucks, or whatever they charge these days. Without scanning the posts, I can't determine which, but it's one or the other, for sure. The GME pump for at least the last month has felt super manufactured. It doesn't have the typical retard vibe.
Yeah he mentioned they are in the business of electricity not just cars. They work more like a R&D
What’s the point of weekends if we can’t lose money on fds? Supposed to better ourselves or some shit?

Margin
What’s this PLTR craze? What happened? Genuinely asking..
Free footlongs incoming.
Followup question: how much can you make by selling the contract in that way? If aapl jumped to $140, for example, and I sold the option I had at $133, am I just making money on the premium paid to me, and if so how is that calculated? Apologies for my lack of knowledge here and I really appreciate the reply.

You can’t make judgment on what will happen until Nio is in the European market. People might not give a shit about it until they see one, get in it and drive. They might realize that they were wrong and that it is indeed a quality vehicle. Casting judgment on a product before you have actually have the chance to experience it for yourself is stupid. It might take time but Nio will be the second largest and most competitive EV company next to Tesla
thank you for the reply sir. I also followed you on Twitter, I have 3750 shares, long since NOV hype. I regret that I didn’t get in this earlier. Plus, my shares are all in cash account, is that means shorts are not able to borrow my shares?

Only dumb if you reinvested all of those gains into the new contract. It's okay to roll out to a further expiration if you think it's gonna go higher but you gotta lock in profit. No one ever went broke from taking profit

You just spend your comments attacking me instead of actually refuting any points, which is exactly what I'd expect from someone who got caught and has no valid point to argue.

Also nice little edit you threw on your last post:

>Edit: someone suggested I take a peak at your profile and so I did. You’re a fucking yapper not a producer. You’ve been here for a year and have done nothing for this community. ***Your comment karma is 100k and your post karma is half of mine and I’ve been here for 3 months.*** Nonsense. Reader beware.

How is my 110k karma half of your 3k karma? lol. I've been on reddit for 11+ years and this subreddit for more than half that, which is why I have the ancient flair that I do and you're rocking a recent ban flair. March your 3 month scrub ass over to the corner and sit the fuck down.

>I’m trying to help you people. Honestly.

Bullshit, if you cared about accuracy or the legitimacy of what you say rather than generating pump hype for your position you'd be arguing with what I said rather than trying (and failing) to attack me as a person while avoiding talking about my points at all.

If you play by the real rules games are usually nasty and short, but keeping taxes in the middle is the most fun way to play with others (and keep Friends).
Flair follow to me lose moneys
There’s no reason to exercise the option, you can just sell it before the expiration.  In fact, that’s what everybody does. 99.9% of options aren’t exercised until the last day. Once you sell it off to someone, you’re free and clear. 

When the next guy exercises it, you don’t owe him anything, the person who wrote the contract owes him the shares. In the account of the original person who wrote it, his account will show -1 contract. In yours it will never say this, it will only say 1 contract, and then when you sell it will say 0. 

People buy calls all the time without having the money to actually exercise them. There’s no risk in that because as the owner of the call only YOU can decide when to exercise it. So just just simply sell it off and you’re all good.

Okay. I plan to buying to hold long term if it drops to around $22 and just average down from there.

In an extreme case, I could see it dropping near $10 but for that to happen, I think the entire market would have to go through a big correction.

I’m inexperienced and curious how this works. If I bought two aapl calls for 1/29 at $133, but don’t have the money to actually exercise the option, how would I make money from this? Selling the call? If the buyer exercised that option, wouldn’t I be on the hook to sell them 200 shares?
One of you rich mofo needs to give out a golden fuckboy. I don't think I've ever seen one
Since we are here can you GME experts tell me what exactly this move to online will do for them or what they will bring to the market that isn't available? Walmart/bestbuy/target already does physical games, consoles, figures and all that and Amazon sells both of those plus sells digital codes for games too, then on the digital side aside for amazin they have to worry about steam, epic, GOG, PSN and xbox.

What exactly will GME have that will make people wanna buy there with how many bridges it burned with gamers? What will be special about it? What will hype up the masses? Because they have had that website for years and it's not even close to being a threat to any of said competitors.
Too bad. :(

The market is fueled by incredibly low interest rates, so there is no where to invest money. Once things stabilize and interest rates are adjusted upward, then things crash. 

 It will probably happen during Biden's 2nd year, look at 2018 when they increased interest rates and the market took a nosedive, Donald Trump ripped the federal reserve a new one and wouldn't let it go until they dropped the rates again... don't think Biden will do the same
Where's WSB?
No, tons of people would rather a physical copy. People also like to buy used games for cheaper than digital.

The 2 biggest reasons some people still buy physical games are the ability to resell/trade-in later, or having slow internet and/or data caps. I download a lot of my games, but I still buy some physical if I think it’s a game I will play through and then be done with it.

Maybe I have the wrong info, but what I’m seeing is that he owns 2.44% of GME as of Q3. I’m not optimistic GameStop will be any different than Sears or BlockBuster. I understand on paper it looks like a good investment, but I don’t see how they will survive long term.
Until internet providers can provide EVERYONE with access to even decent internet. There will always be a need for physical format. Not everyone lives on Google Fiber lines. Not saying I'm bullish for GME, just pointing out that the move to digital only requires a lot more than just having a streaming service around.

I agree entirely with what you said.   Having games played in store will increase foot traffic (esp if they have competitions).  And having more selection in a larger space with fewer stores in an area would make sense.

Ironically, Blockbuster hosted a video game competition for a few years in the mid 90s.  I competed in it one year (I think 95ish).  They had tiers that if you placed first you moved onto the next.  Store->City->Regional->State->National.  IIRC there were big prizes if you won at national.   Bb's gimmick was getting people to rent consoles and the selection of games used in the competition.  An aside, but I find it amusing all the Blockbuster comparisons and the suggestions that Gamestop host games.  

But one thing I haven't read discussed yet is in Gamestop's purchasing ability.  Their buyers (the people who order from suppliers for X number of product) need to have strong connections to getting improved supply.  If they can get more consoles than competitors, they will have a leg up.

If they can also negotiate exclusive deals or versions of games, that could also drive more sales their way too. I don't know if any of this will happen or maybe some of it is already in place.  But it seems unreasonable to think this company sees the iceberg ahead and isn't steering to avoid it.

Nevermind that the type of workers most impact by all this (service industry) are those who are less likely to be homeowners.

I need to list my house this year. Real estate agents say it will be easiest now, but prices won’t likely fall by summer, they’ll just be more competition.
like japan since the 90s? and every developed nation since 2008? kappa. technology growth and access to global labor markets causing a destruction in local labor markets is way more deflationary than "money printing (read: not actually money printing)." just remember folks, low unemployment does not explain why labor participation never recovered

There was no movement in the stock from the volume that was printed but the volume from it was enough to dwarf what happened intraday. And Dark pool trades are available to the public *if* whoever made the trade makes it public
Whats the issue with XPEV? I got in around 40 and change. Should I be dumping? I'd like to hold for a year before dropping it.

Also, how do you think the recent slew of labor issues will affect Apple? They've been fighting against the anti-Uighur slave labor bill in the US and recently several really bad stories about workers not being paid, child labor, and forced labor have come out. I could see Apple getting some really bad press for fighting an anti-slave labor bill, and I wouldn't be surprised if the government comes down on them for the latest stuff, either foreign or domestic.

Correct me if I’m wrong but didn’t Burry sell off a lot of his shares in May. He owned less than 5% after that, and because of this he doesn’t have to disclose any trades made since then.

Edit I was thinking of rocket. United is a broker. But still they need volume to keep pace and I don't know how much more the market can take before everything falls apart.
I still don’t get it. GameStop is going to change over to what new model with all of its physical locations closing? Games are now downloaded directly through the console, Valve dominates pc gaming, every console has its own eshop, etc. Is the new play selling hardware online? Then they’ll be competing with Amazon, BestBuy, NewEgg, and million others who are already in that space.

I write 2-3 weeks out. Usually out the money. Some are in the money but not all. None have reach expiration yet. As long as it stays above 22. I make a profit.

I don’t write all at once. I write a couple each time the price dumps a little. Less likely to keep dumping. So the strike I have is relatively low but still at a good premium.
The exact minute I saw a post on WSB about PLTR I just opened etoro and dropped 10k @$9.. Can't take much credit, saw the post  had a gut feeling, made the trade, then went to do some DD on wtf I just bought.

That's a horrible comparison. People use Chewy because they get their dog food and pet medicine on subscription to their door step at decent prices. Nobody wants to lug 50lbs of dog food home or wait for an employee to validate your dogs prescription drugs.

If you think there is a high demand for gamer merch on a subscription ask loot crate how their bankruptcy went.

If you think GME is going to be delivering physical games, Amazon, Target, Walmart, all do that already at a greater scale. And next launch or slim is going to be purely digital.

GME can downsize and stay afloat for years but there is nothing to pivot to.

Been trading since I was a teenager. You probably didn't know that Microsoft was sharing revenue with GameStop on all DLC, games, and micro transactions conducted on Xboxes they sell (https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/microsoft-will-give-gamestop-a-share-of-xboxs-digital-revenues/) but then again you probably have done zero DD on what is actually going on with GME.

Please short. Find some shares and pay longs interest while you piss away the margin in your account. GameStop will be triple digits in 2023.

My view is that the structure of the deal means SPAC holders aren't going to hold much of the company and maybe the insiders sell hard once it switches over. Plus being a mortgage orginationer isn't the best thing if we see an economic backlash from 2020 carry over.

I’m a bit confused - you have calls for 2 years from now at $87.50, but isn’t the current price ~$132?

So does that mean you think the price is going to decrease? And I thought that would be a short

As you can probably tell I don’t trade options, so I’m a bit lost here. If anyone can quickly clear this up it would be much appreciated. Thank you :)

Germany does have a strong economy and I will admit that some developed countries have strong manufacturing economies but I feel like the US is just so tech-focused with Cloud, AI, Battery/Energy tech, Semiconductors, Genomic, etc. that we won't need to manufacture some of the more boring/less profit-generating stuff lol

And when you look at like Canada, Netherlands, France, UK though they have similar manufacturing rates to the US. 

Also yeah our military spending is outrageous and we need to coordinate efforts with our allies way more/they need to pull more weight

That is such a retarded take. What does it have to do with anything. You could have gotten rich off of any scam stock by being lucky. 

Apple didn't get close to bankruptcy after 2013. Also they didn't promise 1 million robotaxis on the road at the end of 2020... Retards just keep believing in Elon even though time and time again he has promised things he couldn't deliver on. And he recently admitted coming to within a month of bankruptcy while trying to make the model 3.

So you think Elon really believed it when he said they would be operating a huge nationwide network of driverless robotaxis this year?

Haven't played any plug options in a while but I was just looking at their Jan 29 calls. $36C is 2.56 and $37c is $2.50.   $6 risk per CDS. If it actually fills at that price ill be surprised but that's the first thing  I'm looking at when market opens

I think the consensus is gradual. Probably over a week though, not months. Someone can correct me if I’m wrong.
Why OTM tho? Seems like you occur a lot more risk for little more reward. I like them deep ITM for the security and you still get like 3x returns with 1/2 the capital.

I disagree with the other poster.  I don’t have a lot of faith in your January call due to increasing theta decay.  But I do expect the stock to rise again soon, so I would hold the February for another week or two. (I try to exit positions around 45 days to expiration).

Technically its wrong. But putting 500 in the middle plus every tax is the way to go. If youre losing it, Gives you a hail mary instead of slowly bleeding to death. 
If youre winning it allows quicker hoyses and hotels so you can hurry up and stop playing monopoly.
If they are cash secured how's he going to lose all his money?  He can def lose all his gains, but to lose all of his initial capital would require a bankruptcy

I wait for a stock to be off its ATH by at least 15% and then get 1 year leaps. Usually 5% - 25% OTM depending on the ticker. 

Gives me a lot of time to let the ticker get back up and if I get lucky it breaks out. 

If anyone works 6 month and 12 month leaps I’d love to chat more.

What does a hand job get me?
It’s hard. But the best way is just to find something else. I used to smoke while driving so I got rid of my car because I moved to a city and suddenly the cravings were gone. Find when you smoke or what the habit includes and try to cut that out or mix it up.
I would go yeti out of those 3. If you do pick yeti, order from Austin Canoe & Kayak. Sign up for their email list and you’ll receive a 15% off coupon. One of the only places I’ve found that will discount Yeti products.
Not yet. Just waiting for an announce.
To everyone asking how is it Bullish that GME is closing stores. There are more than 30 stores within 30 miles of my location. Hell there are three in my city, 3 miles apart. There is no need for that many stores. That is why they are closing many locations to bring up profits!
has to be somebody in here with a fart fetish
Yes but who do you like in the new season?
The 50 day is at 14.35. Cohen (and others) don’t care and will average down and drive it up and take profits when they feel like. Don’t base a decision of a position a firm. Also don’t base it on a particular price. Many positions are hedges, some are just starters, etc. if you don’t work there, don’t rationalize is my point. So many potentials reasons. I know the business. All this and I’m not saying I will be right because we’re all theorizing. Let’s try and make money

I have been working in IT for years. Palantir is not special. Data is data and anyone can build an api
Yeah But you are safer selling OTM puts
Because you have calls expiring soon or because you have shares and plan on holding for years?
Yeah unfortunately stocks don’t typically play out that way. It’d be too easy. Typically you want to find an industry that has huge potential and then start buying into shares/leaps. Solar, cybersecurity, data, EV, and Aerospace are my plays. These industries are still in their infancy but will be massive in ten years.
To be fair, I wouldn't put much weight into the Mall stores anymore. If they close a busy plaza, I would be worried. That said, and it's just speculation. I don't think physical will die out. Plenty of gamers want the Disk version of the PS5, and it isn't like Nintendo fans only use the eshop over buying the physical copy. I won't be bullish on Gamestop, but I think with the restructuring they have and Reggie in there they might make it. Look at how Best Buy keeps going.

I called Emma Watson on New Year’s Eve, told her about my sick stonks that I bought. I have both GME and pltr calls for Jan 8, she was really impressed. I told her (not to brag) but I had 2 shares of TSLA I bought at $715 and needless to say- I’ve been icing my balls all day from how hard she blew me.

I’m with a media/marketing/printing company and it’s just a lot of that same kind of shit. Like someone will come asking for something that relates to what we do but we don’t actually do so we say “yeah we can do that” and farm it to someone else who I’m sure will often farm it or a piece of it to someone else etc.

You’ve got the production side of things that often requires specific equipment and then there’s the transportation, installation, etc. It’s not uncommon for us to just be the project manager for a job being produced, delivered, and installed by other companies. 

Part of my role is painting a pretty client-facing picture of this “one solution” company that can do all these great things when really the amount of in-house shit we can do is very limited. You would never know that from the outside though. It’s given me all kinds of trust issues with other companies that look all nice on the outside lol.

The ["DD" post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kldiv2/psth_explained_ive_had_enough_this_is_a_monetary/) you linked in your op is literally you trying to convince people they might get 4/9 warrants instead of 2/9 due to redemptions, which as I spelled out is mathematically impossible - much less to the ridiculous scale where half the commons are redeemed.

I suspect that you already know this and are just trying to take advantage of people who aren't familiar with spacs *(especially since you mention a ludicrous $100 price target in your "DD")*, but if you're actually serious then you're a delusional fool.
Cruel to get our stimmies on a Friday the market’s closed

I agree, it's a terrible business if you look at their financial. Plus these are short dated OTM calls, sure it will bounce a bit but not by much. Oh and I think more shares that were locked before are now hitting the market. Risk/reward isn't worth it for me.

Maaan! He killed that bitch, they gave him 25 years
One of these days, it might take 10 years , we might flirt with it 20 or 30X but PLTR will cross 30$ per share and stay there. And the retard that buys FD's every week until that happened will then gloat and say I told you so to all the gay bears. Those autists will start producing memes and planning how to spend their new wealth, and at that point there will be a market crash  PLTR will fall below $30 and there FD's will expire worthless again.
Just quit yesterday. Fiending but committed.

Obviously I’m not saying I’m some sort of oracle and I can read the future. And no intention of setting any expectations, so if that’s how you read, apologies. This is simply what MY play would be if I was GME. And if some retard from /r/WSB can think of it, I’m sure they can also think of it. Will they execute it? Again, who can tell the future so TBD.
I think there’s a lot of evidence out there that points to federal student loan programs to be the cause of higher ed problems.
It’s basically a blank check for universities to charge whatever they want. If loans were issued by universities themselves they would have a vested interest in making sure students could payback the debt.
Student loan forgiveness would be a giant bailout for the failure of academia.

I personally take Elon's timelines with a grain of salt.  All the things he's said he would do and products he's said he would roll out he always delivers but just a matter of timing.  He has gotten better lately though (i.e. fsd beta roll out date was on time for end of 2020).  I give him the benefit of the doubt because he's doing stuff that is seen as pretty impossible, like landing rockets, building gigantic factories at super speed, cars that drive themselves etc.  I'm not surprised it takes some time.  

It's kinda like if a doctor says they'll cure someone's cancer in 2021 but it takes them until 2022.  Rather than getting upset that they missed the target deadline, it's important to recognize that hey, they just cured your cancer.  

I've watched some of the FSD beta videos on YouTube, and those are a pretty decent preliminary proof of concept for robotaxis for me.  You can find them if you just search FSD beta on YouTube.  Any time the blue steering wheel icon is on that means the car is doing everything.  If the driver turns the steering wheel the blue steering wheel icon goes away.  That's how you know when the car is driving itself or not.  As you watch through those videos you'll see the car being able to do alot of the driving itself, and as the beta testers report cases where the car makes a mistake (by pressing a button on the screen) then you know that will flag Tesla to then go and modify or further train their AI to handle that better in the future.  

Have a look, it's kind of neat to watch the car do its thing.

Your DD is shit. You obviously haven't been trading long enough if you think numbers make sense and that drives markets.

GME has no market moving forward, games are bought and rented through the system's stores.  Plus, a lot of games are moving to computers and away from consoles. They are the blockbuster and gamefly of the 2000's. 

Inverse everything this guy says and thank God the squeeze has it so high right now.

Gamestop has ALWAYS had way too many stores. Even now on the tail end of what many would consider a "slaughter" they STILL have too many stores. 

They'll perform way better by having 2-3 stores in most markets that are much larger. What's the point in having 8 stores in a town of < 1 Million People where at least half the product or more is redundant?

The way forward for gamestop is with a bigger store and the embracing of "non-digital" assets - IE: Imagine a gamestop that not only had video games but stocked Warhammer pieces, DnD shit, MTG and other CCG. They could have a space dedicated to playing the actual games and sell snacks and shit. 

I doubt they'll make that move, but that's really what they ought to do.
Damn, better luck next time, bro

Do you have any money? You can buy an insurance book of business if so. 

If not both are going to be tough slogs at the beginning. There’s no real barrier to entry so the beginning of your career you will have to bust your ass to stand out from the crowd but you can make incredible money. Are you self motivated and will you make yourself make cold calls and do follow ups every day? If so you can be successful, but if you have those traits you’ll probably be successful in pretty much any industry. If I had to go one of those routes I’d choose insurance but there’s absolutely money on either path.

My local mall is dying. Sears was one of the cornerstones since it was built in the 70’s. They are gone and roughly 30% of the storefronts are vacant. Jc penny looked pretty rough and I found out h&m was gone today when I went there. Macy’s, the current other cornerstone, a former Lazarus is also looking like a ghost town. Unfortunately malls are on their way out as stores close up and move elsewhere. This pandemic is cleaning house on the vestiges that remain of our once busy shopping center.

The actor for Cao Cao in the Three Kingdoms series is from the Hui minority. He’s practically indistinguishable from normal “Chinese.” So I suppose a big part comes from resistance to integrate or be assimilated into the concept of Chineseness on part of the Uighur Chinese. Not making a call whether it’s right or wrong.
Did you just use the Holy trinity as a title?
Seems like a sign to buy more like a retard
Curious what other industry could compare? Aerospace? What a nightmare too lol. It’s all a clown show
I haven’t done any gay stuff before but is it polite to pull out the first time you hook up or is it customary to not. Just planning a nice get away for this weekend. 

Also buying some puts.
and I agree about GSX...so much trash coming out of China (I'm just talking about stocks).  We all say "I don't want cheap chinese shit" or knock offs, but when the masses are talking about Chinese stocks, "Oh, it's the next TSLA or AMZN of China!"
Sure cowboy

I’m not creative enough. I’m making some bad plays with Spacs rn so maybe something like “SPAC me daddy” or “SPACman’s bitch”. Seriously tho, if PTSH goes for subway my portfolio is getting a $5 foot long in the ass 😓
Would it be gay to be pegged by Cathie? 🤔
That was funny
Well the game was supposed to be exactly like real life. That’s why it’s super unfair and boring towards the end.

There’s nothing wrong with options. There was just something very wrong with your approach to options. I’m up 60% this month just scalping weeklies using my own reversal indicators. 50% portfolio sizing, 10% stop loss, 3-8 DTE range. Never had problems bagging 5-15% returns. You just need to learn how to approach it correctly.
Lemme re-enlist and get my a-10 real quick
don't sell the house, property values nearly always go up a significant amount after a few years, family members use to own huge lots of land and sold them in the '90s for about 50k and today they would have been worth millions of millions of dollars. I felt the same way you did about being a landlord it was a pain dealing with everything I hired a property manager after interviewing half a dozen companies and came to a decision about one and I quite literally do almost nothing now with the house besides check on it to make sure everything is okay with it, pay taxes and make passive income, I would highly highly recommend a property manager to deal with the property, it'll make you money practically your whole life you can use to invest or buy more rental properties.

Zoom in. "This location only" 

Also, the fact Gamestop had to point out "this location only" is a subliminal message to investors "Don't you worry"
No regerts!!
mods can i get a anal flair instead of my jailbait flair
Well it’s where anyone will barely see anyway. Not much of a retard. A retard will get that on their forearm or face 😂
Humans are simple creatures we enjoy familiarity and we apply caution to the unfamiliar. I from the bottom of my heart seeing all my friends and family wanting a Tesla they don’t even know what a nio is. In fact the only person out of my personal group who knows about nio is me cause I own the stock

Thought it was pretty disappointing tbh. Like an edgier version of a Lifetime movie.
Long term TA like this is smoke and mirrors. TA that works is intraday most of the time.

Karp's interview on the 7th will completely invalidate any current TA for after that catalyst. I expect it to be bullish, but whether it's bullish, bearish, or sideways is unpredictable at this time.

This very heavily depends on where you live. There is a trend for medium density multi unit or mixed tenure residential in our city in Canada. That's where I would put my money. Single family dwellings are prohibitively expensive for most people now.
I’ll take some theta gang flair if flairs are actually a thing right now, if not oh well

Why everyone wanna ban him?🤣retarded?
Exactly. People should know that in the startup/growth world it's super common to actively try to spend down any potential profits, and go flat or negative on earnings. The reason is any profits get taxed. Instead of generating profits and paying taxes on them, you aim to spend it all down by putting it back into growth - hiring, building, advertising, etc. Basic 101 shit, but WSB loves to quote P/E in the context of these companies. Same bros that were screaming short SNAP when it was at $6 👌
Still a thing apperently

Holy shit lmao. Why is this so similar to the way I see my industry too. A bunch of assholes bullshitting you to then bullshit with other assholes and so on lol

Next time I’m definitely going to look and see if I can’t cut the middleman and save myself some money. Don’t want to think about how much I’ve probably thrown away lol
