We are entering into the year of the Ox (literally a fucking bull). Looking back at the past few years of the Ox:

1985: DOW +27.66% 

1997: S&P 500 +33%

2009: S&P 500 +26.46%

I figured this would be more useful than the autisrologists and their crayons.

1 [Couple](https://twitter.com/pepeforthewin/status/1344868746897321984?s=21) from Boston just wanted to look at my condo because “They planned on moving to Texas.” They invited me to their hotel pool the next day though. That was nice. 

The other couple kidnapped me when I was waiting for an Uber outside a bar and told me they’d “Take me home.”

Came to the conclusion a few years ago that I’m just a human dildo.
Damn bruh
Started the year with \~$520K, hit $660K yesterday after ending \~$640K today. Low of the year was $450K in September. Lost most money with options and made most money from PLTR & SPACs. Didn't beat the market but thankful that I don't have the decades of cap loss carryover.
9 minutes here but I'm about to finish this drink and pass out. Happy new years!!
I'm in for 80% of my cash.  I hope you are wrong

If you ain't bag holding PLTR, you ain't WSB material.
Your 100x requires a 1% probability of success to break even, anything less is a bad gamble and anything above that would be considered a good one.
With MitchCuckFuck killing the $2000 stimmy as anticipated, Democrats now have a greater chance of winning the Georgia Senate elections. We know that all weedstocks will moon if Democrats can take over the senate. 
Pair the above with decent APHA earnings on Jan 15, which I think will happen from all the data I've seen.

I wouldn't call it a sure thing, but argue that it's a great gambling oppirtunity.
**REMINDER OF HOW TO DEAL WITH THREE DAY WEEKENDS**

4) Nap

5) Wake up around 8, eat, jerk off

Thats the point, for almost everyone here it's lucky they make anymore than they could just playing etfs. Everyone here is playing a losing game, some are just pushing the luck further but everyone here eventually will make it to 0 if they play options less than a few months out constantly. 

If you take out 5k and play with the other 95k for example. Once you lose the 95k, you are just going to put the 5k back in or decide to never trade again. Eventually everyone will make it to never trade again unless you are apart of the 1 or 2%.

But as some douchey suit yelled in The Big Short...”it’s the same thing!”
More GME
you'd think bush but smart money's on strip
mariah got that thiccness
enphase is an amazing company, i'd only be really worried if I was in solaredge.
nah
Nobody knows
Oh shit, here we go again...
Yeah I’m donezo they are bad news
OMG I want to know the result so badly
Sounds about right, I was considering doing that until I started my gambling addicti— I mean started “investing”
Whats a nickname for millennial? Boomer and zoomer sound way better
How tf can I see JLo ffs CNN and ABC News not airing it
Up $265. still down 2.6k all time. lowest point was 7995 (down 42%)

after learning to use different starts and a bit technical, I was able to recover 3/5.8k in the past 2 months. hoping to break even by end of january.

really learned to not fight the trend. Time decay is a bitch. don't catch a falling knife. the stock market doesn't reflect the economy. the market is very forward-looking. I buy shares when I can, and play with options with about 20% of portfolio. shares are stress-free if you understand what you're buying and are confident in the position, but that doesn't mean you'll be right. DD are hit or miss, I typically check their history to make sure its not their first time. Looking forward to 2021 for the good and the bad. shoutout to SQ for gains too.
Yooo Mariah Carey has some big ole titties
At least you lost it before you got taxed on it
Not much to roast... you lost 2K... welcome to the club.

I hear you can request 2K from Moscow Mitch via Venmo...

This you lost nothing.
But did you hold?!?
all in THCB, do it
Which market?
NIO TO THE FOOKING MOON! 

Sorry, frick gme. Nio day soon, more volume and volatility!

Holding GME be like clamping down on After Thanksgiving **turd**, waiting for Christmas, changing to New Years, then hoping for Valentine's Day (FEB14). That **turd** is going to happen.

Problem is, it's not your **turd**, all the other retards have be evacuating their bowels into bags they'll be handing you on President's Day (FEB15).

So, ask yerself this: Will you be there to receive it?

How can I speak, weak at my knees

Ah yes, *cuck*. Trump didn't win the election. Hope you can stop crying in your pillow about that every night, pull yourself up by your bootstraps, and not be gay.
PLTR having BOGO sales. Buy the first dip and you'll get the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, etc one free. The more you buy, the more dips you'll get. YUGE DISCOUNT right there.

Seriously mate just wanted to say that what is possible in america doesnt exactly count for the rest of the world. Both in good and bad ways.

Can someone help me find the post from about a month ago of the kid who made ~350k in calls in a week and said he was going to quit college when he reaches 750k-1M (guaranteed to happen by a week or two according to himself)?  Really wanna see if he blew it yet or not
X or ban has to be the guy who drank his own piss, right?
no, if they somehow blocked international transactions (chinese buying NYSE stocks, for example) that'd be bearish
God damn I want Mariah Carey to knock me out with one of those tiddies like it's a Twisted Tea
What are percs?
no, more money in US stocks. Bullish
I talk with you mom about my sex life. Not weird.
75% VTI, 20% VXUS, 5% play money. If you want to go the retarded route just do a combination of GME, PLTR, and whatever meme stocks Cathie Woods is pumping.

Why does everyone think this is going to take off? They were like -$500 million last year right?
That’s what my parents told me 😩

Lol, the intraday movement would be wild.

Better yet start a 10x reverse etf on tsla, pltr etc and name it GUH
Bought 250 more shares today! Thanks for the post, always great to read your DD. Happy new year!

Apparently pre-teen/early teen can get testosterone/hormone treatment to correct it.  But it has to be done early or that happens (you live with a micro penis forever).  Yeah, I looked it up because was curious how they get a small ass dick.   That shit was bizarre.  Hard to un-see that shit now. It's not blurred out.  Obligatory, no homo.
I always ask that lol when I see retards like that tesla guy who turn 400 into like a 100k or whatever. Why the fuck did he not sell when he turned it into 25k or 50k. Like wtf.
Aaand it’s gone
What’s the difference exactly?
I'm looking at some of the orders in the spread book on ToS... do people actually get filled on this shit?  

Check out the profit vs loss on this fucking IC: 

SELL -1 IRON CONDOR TSLA 100 (Weeklys) 8 JAN 21 750/830/690/610 CALL/PUT 80.00 LMT

8k profit, no loss.  There's no way in hell that shit gets filled, right?
Yeah but they get to go to sleep at a decent hour each night
HERE WE GO WSB. 
I put 6k in my account in June. Made it all the way to 13,000 before losing it ALL. I told myself I couldn’t lose any money in the craziest year ever so I threw 4,000 in my account I’m December. With that 4K I crawled my way back to 11,000. So I am up a measly 1,000. Happy 2021!! I learned to be patient and only look for the ideal set ups.

I just bought a bunch of shares of FUBO today at $27 and I’m up lol
If I’m not mistaken most of the stock was held internally through the company, so when this “squeeze” happened the majority of the shares were held with individuals in the company who essentially rode the wave up. I could be mistaken because I am retarded
PSTH, TSLA or MT.
And im saying that compound is easier way to achieve comfortable late 40's than working your ass off. 99% of people on this planet wont reach 500k a year if they did 500k a year would be barely enough to survive. Not even gonna start on the fact that 10% of population would struggle to tell how many zeroes there are in that number. Not everyone lives in america and most doesnt work in it or healtcare. So dramatic wage increases are not a possibility. Also ffs im talking about maths. How much u get out of better pay vs how much u get out of compounded returns. Also u not gonna work till you are 70 or 80 while returns are still coming in... im not saying that its bad to increase your salary im saying that compounded returns(i hopefully using the right term to describe that 8% becoming a bigger and bigger sum over time) are easier to achieve than getting a significant payrise every year for the most of population. Most of the world sits in 5 digit or less income, not 200k+.

I guess it depends on your entry, I got in at 16 dollar cost basis and covered calls reduce it further
shit is hilarious, everyone's drunk
respek for food bank contribution, they need it!
My cost basis is $37, I can decrease it further reselling a call...Just waiting for the price to finally go above 40 again to do that.

PLTR leap calls to Nov 2021....Atleast that’s where my stimmy check will be going.

Or buy June calls for MT
[deleted]
Because you’d spend a bunch of time while the stock price is $2-$5, kinda like how it was first half of 2020 buying bullish derivatives on it, and then after you’ve set your position with it slightly moving it upward due to the call exposure then you’d finally start adding the share purchases to create the breakout until the upper teens where you’d unload the calls and start unloading the shares afterwards once all of retail catches on thinking they found something


Oh wait
This is currently the most awarded post on reddit
They definitely paid back some prematurely. I'm not sure how credit ratings work with companies, but I think a junk rating prevents the institution buying.
yeah, my new plan for 2021 is every time i make a profit on my trades, i'll take 20-30% of it and buy GME shares, including every two weeks when i get paid. Just stack them week after week.

You do but Robinhood is a shit broker that doesn't normally let you buy warrants or units that split into warrants, so there's a big question how they're going to handle the PSTH shares when the warrants split from them, since they let people buy them.

Obviously the Robinhood traders will hold the shares of the merged company, but RH can't give a good answer on what happens to the attached warrants.

Spend money at GameStop too? Just a thought... not being cynical sitting on 30 feb calls. If the core business has positive earnings won’t that in turn drive buzz news as well? Let’s say everyone holding long on GME spent $100 on a specific day, like a Black Friday type of day, that would make news I would think. 

Idk, I suck at this game. I started on third base and some how found myself back at first with 2 outs

Oh, and my girl's probably gonna break up with me once again. Happy new year I guess guys
That's why I also own shares without calls sold on them. 


I cannot go all-in with half my networth on a WSB bet without some downside protection. It's really only the choice between "5k in this meme stock" and "5k and an additional 10k with covered calls in this meme stock"
I’m down 10% on my PLTR shares. But I’m still holding for now.
Happy new year y'all!

godammit i'm in…
How’s it going so far? Is Covid still a thing?
I like watching it go down
Yeah I agree with you. I usually stick to day reading only and I don’t typically hold positions over night. Right now I have 1,000 PLTR shares locked in at $23.68 and I have the funds to buy another 2,000 shares if necessary to continue my dollar cost average strategy on Monday if PLTR continued to drop like it did today.
Good, more warrants for me. Tontine, bitch
DD is whack but I hope you are right :)
Another way to think of it is think of the most down autistly retard and than realize 60% of the world is dumber than that guy.

But then what happens is you lose the 30% and you still want to play so you take 10% from your safe plays. You then lose this and still want to play so repeat. The only way to successfully win is walk away for good after you win.

Ok good that is not that much big picture. I’ve never actually been hit with a margin call but I’ve heard it is usually when you’ve maxed out all of our margin and you are down more than 20%. But I’m not positive about that. Also, they will tell you to load a specific dollar amount in your account to avoid the margin call from triggering. And the margin call will happen after the market closes and if you have not loaded the money
Happy new year and let the paper keep coming

I can’t decide if Elon telling us his stock price was too high knowing it was going to split soon was the greatest 4D chess play ever or if the circuit breakers in March were my favorite 2020 stock market stories.

Regardless, Elon is my favorite African-American. Also, the USD has retard strength. Imagine any other country ‘creating’ 22% of their total currency in circulation and not collapsing their dollar like Venezuela.

Anyways, cheers you fucking retards. 🍻
Dude you got lucky turning $2k to $100k but because you lacked the experience with risk management you thought like the rest of the amateur retards that you could turn your luck with $100k to $1m. Luck rarely last in trading, hope you learned that

Bought 15% of my portfolio into wkhs options when it was $3 two weeks before it ran up like crazy. If i had just held everything i probabaly would have made 300k but i was selling on the way up so i made about 120k

Basically was at 430k wen corona hit and now im at 1.42m

So what I understood from this is that Jack Ma screwed a Pangolin and started COVID to get back at China?
Buying PSTH and selling Dec31/2021 $40 calls seems decent. You eliminate basically 100% of the risk as your new break even is at ~21, and you still have a nearly 100% upside (capital at risk is $21 , max gain is $19 per share when PSTH ends at $40).


Going to put $10k in that in this play (so 500 shares and 5 covered call - contracts that I'll sell). Also going to buy a few more shares (like for $1.5k - ish)


I will have like $5k in shares without calls then (unlimited gainz) and $10k in shares where my gains are capped at $40 this year.


Doesn't sound much, but that's half my networth and 1/5 of the capital I invest with.


Happy new year 👍💥🎉

If this GME short squeeze is so “well-known”, I don’t understand why some hedge fund (or a team of) is not buying up 70% of the shares like Porsche did and just not release them. Sure that’s 635M, and quite a bit of play, but that’s pretty much a guaranteed $5.7B profit, no (especially if multiple funds team up). The news will be quite the “shock” no one would see it coming and there will be short panic? This just seems like an easy play for the big boys, no?

Edit: The funds don’t necessary have to believe in GME and its future. Just the technical set up and the number of shares shorted. This would be a pure numbers play.
Weeklies got me too. Took 3k to above 50k and thought I was god, back into weeklies and lost it all. Then deposited 5k and lost it all on more weeklies. It hurts being this stupid.

I highly recommend trading in a cash account to avoid the PDT rule. Taking profits is the most important thing with options. If you could get a good trade once or twice a day it adds up. One day you'll be over $10k then $40k then $200k. RH makes everyone trade with margin. I recommend Webull or ToS or another account that allows trading options in a cash account. The best part is that option trades settle the next day and you can use the funds the next day. No reason to take unnecessary risks. Just cut your losses and move on. This is basically structured gambling. Eventually, you'll win. You need to make sure your account doesn't go to zero trying to find it.
Wow. That’s incredible value imo. They are going to make you insane gains! Well done brother!

Nice! You should continue to dollar cost average if possible. I am also holding 1,000 shares right now but I have a large bankroll and have also been using margin to implement my dollar cost average strategy that I’ve been doing.
It’s risky to chase it downhill though, I’m taking my remaining cash and chasing other opportunities, primarily shorting DASH as I think that will tank during the lockup exp in March.

i am not a PLTR guy to the degree the rest of you are but i did sell $21 strike puts today for 15-Jan.  $550 premium to lock up $21,000 for two weeks.

when IV is this high on a stock i elect to sell options, i am still on the long side of PLTR but i think people are too relentless with call buying and don't look at put selling as an alternative to make money.

as an aside i really enjoy watching Italians eat spaghetti and gesture with their utensils.

good luck everyone!

In al honesty, these trading days are low volume, and don’t mean a lot. Went through this the last couple years. Anyone reading this, I wouldn’t by calls with a sooner expiration than March. But, I’ll still sell you shorter calls if you can’t read ^ this.

Yea bro kind of nervous for Kendall. Does his father throw him under the bus for what happened to the young bartender? Man I need season 3 to come out now!
Well again, most people dont make 200k a year tho. And yes if they drop it at the same time then yes bigger number ofc wins but no one was talking about tripling your income yearly.. if you can rise your salary 300% per year ofc it wins in compound ace big time.. but even 50% raises wont happen indefinitely. My point was, since you missed it, that constant 8% after 20 30 or 40 years will be more significant than couple of 50% of raises along the way. I was not saying that a guy with 70k income can outinvest a guy with 200k income.

My rage against FUBO is unending

When I have millions of dollars and FUBO is worthless I will purchase majority share and fire the CEO in the parking lot and look him in the eyes so he knows the retard who did this to him.
Of course it’s going to drop, when’s the last time you went to GameStop and purchased something.
For all of the times these hedge funds and “institutions” have beat up and cheated the retail investors, this GME thing is our chance to hit them back.  It might be a pin prick but a pin prick deep in the eye.

I don’t want to dampen the mood, but, 2021 is going to be more of the same for a majority of the year until the vaccine is rolled out to the masses which is going to take a considerable amount of time. You can pretty much safely keep playing stay at home stocks for a majority of the year.
why not a whole strip club? Keep ur goals high 👑
Just chill for a minute. Buy AAPL shares and then just yolo small amounts until you figure it out
Yeah that realistically makes sense. That is exactly why I’ve been playing defense and have been successfully implementing my aggressive dollar cost average strategy until the sell off cools off
You flew too close to the sun
Yes, all day trades. Total I have over $100k between accounts. I've taken a good amount out. I try to trade with only $10-$20k a day to keep risk lower. I've been started my trades with only $1k and scaling in/averaging down to full size of $5k to $10k.

Biden and bear both start with B. Bear market 2021 confirmed.
I think the idea is that you only have $10k. $17.50 strike provides roughly 1.8x leverage versus buying shares and you're really only paying a 7% premium for that 80% additional buying power.

CGC ez. Dems win GA run offs on 1/5 so get the 1/8 calls and stocks go through the center of the moon on their way to Pluto in anticipation of Kushala Harris on stand by to break any silly ties that might happen in Senate on the path to at least decriminalization and legalization shortly after (years, shortly). Which is fine because you sell some of your Pluto bound calls and get an insane amount of stock with your tendie mountain, which will again go to Pluto 2.0 when legalization happens later. Don't say I wish I knew.
Ok lets be real if there’s people making like 10,000% gains do trading desks make the same amount of returns or better ?

Or are literal normies outdoing these trading firms?
I’m holding MASSIVE bags of STIC can someone tell me what the fuck to do.
By end of September 2020 I was down 200% percent on the year. ( 2 account blow ups in a year) Then did really good in Sept-Nov and closed the year up 40%. December was flat for me.    


I was 100% options during the march 2020 crash long on Boeing options, the pussy fucking FAA chairman got me. I lost like 90% of my account on Boeing. Then started doing weekly SPY options,  at this point was was down like 160% for the year, then lost another 40%. Then started recovering at end of 2020.    


Basically I missed everything, had to make my way back up  from trading like $2,000.   


Some helpful tips:   


1. Risk management (don't put 100% of your account in 1 stock ) 
2. Never buy puts ( yes in last 3 years only march 2020  was the best time to buy puts) 
3. Don't listen to any fucking Twitter Guru's, PAID or not
4. Listen to mem stocks on WSB 
5. Don't play the fucking earnings (25% of my total loses were due to earning plays), I completely stopped doing this. 

My biggest hero on WSB is a guy who invested $500 in Tesla options and turned it into $100,000 dollars.

[removed]
No, I did. I definitely made money here and there playing TSLA, AMZN and even CRSR but my problem was getting too greedy and being impatient. I went from $1200 to $11,500 back in the summer then lost it all during the Sept crash, and prior to that, I went all in on airlines/cruiselines on June 7th-8th and lost 80% of that by the 11th. I'ma use this weekend to come up with a better trading strategy, and play smarter moving forward and putting profits into shares (and not selling for a loss thats for sure in hindsight). I learned a lot since I started trading back in April and this is only the beginning for sure.

No. The missed payments due at the end of a forbearance period do not have to be made up in a single payment.  However, if you can make up the all the payments in a lump sum and resume making regular monthly mortgage payments, then you may do so.

Depends how actively you want to play with it. 
r/thetagang would be a better place to actively learn, as this is the back of a wendies. 
If you just want it to sit, SPY/VOO/QQQ are all good set and forgets. I’d recommend learning how the three are different and picking a single one. 
If you want to gamble it, very outside the character you described, Throw it all at one of the tickers on here who has DD for at least a month from different activas users. Understand your risk is high, and the more you know the lower it is.

It's not really a scam. A scam is if I say I have an iPhone and then deliver you a brick in a box. This is more like someone seeing the iPhone's success and building an Android clone. It's how xiaomi and Huawei started off, people forget how shitty they were and how blatant of aripoff it was. Now they are both multi billion businesses capable of building flagship phones. Not that Jumia will be the Xiaomi/Huawei of Amazon but that was the original inception it's what rocket internet specializes in. They clone businesses and exits them early. They are the parents of companies like Hello fresh now worth $14B. They almost always get them listed or bought out by bigger brands. With them gone the CEOs are under the direction of the board and top shareholders which still consists of MTN,   a Google exec, UBS/Etsy/Square space board member, investment firms, etc. In terms of time frames I have all day. I can sell covered calls waiting for profitability.

What? No you are absolutely incorrect if you think its better to get 8% interest on a median income than it would be to triple your income early in your career and invest a similar or even leverage the increased income.

Even if you are a bad investor if you make over 200k you outpace anyone making under 70k by such a large margin im unsure why we are discussing this.

That is all you ever hear working people talkin about I guess they've all heard it so many times that they're brainwashed.

That's why trading high IV companies just for the sake of high IV isn't a good strategy. It is much better to employ these strategies in market-leading companies like AMZN/GOOG/TSLA/FB/AAPL/DG/MCD/etc. These companies have competitive moats in their respective industries, large cash reserves, etc., which allow them to recover from major crashes much quicker than the random high IV stocks. You can simply sit through the correction via rolling down the strike and rolling out the date, bag holding for 1-2 months instead of 1-2 years.
The same concentrated risky option plays that took him from 2K to 100K in a sharply rising market were his downfall when the market stopped soaring.

But if you sell, you will actually lose money... Simple math
I couldnt read the reviews on Pink and also i didnt see the Chinese girls so i googled lucky Numbers china. ”Number 8 holds huge significance as a lucky number. To a lesser extent 2, 6, and 9 are considered lucky. 4 is the most unlucky number in China.”

So it would be best with 8 Chinese girls in one week, starting with the 3some but if you can only afford the 3some, 2 is lucky to a lesser extent. Whatever you do. Avoid having a fivesome with 4 Chinese girls at once. That would be very unlucky indeed.

I gave this some thought and i would go for the 2 Chinese girls https://youtu.be/OiolD2tG-aY
Haha yeah I hear ya. I grew up reasonably well and never got hand outs either =).

Was It though ?
Yes and a bit unrealistic of an expectation. Index funds just dont return that anymore. Im not saying you cant get 10-12  but if you want to calculate expected retirement funds I think a worst case of 6% is more likely .

Its closer to 32 years at 10k per year to hit 1 million.

Even still 1 million will barely last you 10-15 years. It would be a joke to think of such a person as a millionaire. Such a person wouldn’t be a millionaire very long.
I’m retarded but not that retarded
230k is doable again. something like 500-800k would be rough.

Oh for fucks sake, I just loaded up on calls 💀
...while pooping and executing trades (forgetting to wipe and wash hands but that doesn’t matter today) 💸💸💸
If you look at GME’s 2007 and 2013 spike due to console cycles, just before the spike, you’ll see a classic cup and handle. Now, if you look at GME’s 6-month chart, you’ll see another beautiful cup and handle from Dec. 1st to 31st. This is so perfectly timed for when/if Cohen releases another 13D this weekend + the sales number next week. 🚀🚀🚀
That just got absorbed back by calls expiring on the 31st and 8th.
Options is a terrible idea right now. I agree with the reversal next week, it's uncanny how much this is mirroring last month's PLTR shitshow. I'm guessing for strong premarket performance and a sideways/slightly bullish day Monday with a spike on Tuesday.

Well all people wont be working in the most rewarded sector. If they did it wouldnt be such a generous run for neither of them. While putting it to indexed can be easily done by most individuals. Even in tech getting 2.25 times in 2 years is extremely generous i hope you realise that yourself. Also after 20years of compounded returns constant 8 percent are still superrior.. thats not up for debate thats simple math 🤷‍♂️

Jacks a lot
I don’t want to leave the Congo
I’m gonna have to pull a Sun Tzu art of war answer to the question of how many shares. 

Let’s just say 25% of portfolio.

Glad to hear you’re not retarded. A very similar sentiment was made regarding Tesla and it was that vehement and it was that widespread and it was that early on. I had boomer friends of mine who kept swearing that Ford was a better investment than Tesla and that he held short positions in Tesla (this was back in 2017).

What most people are having a hard time understanding is 1. The business model and 2. The secondary markets that Palantir will enter.

The comment below is somewhat right but it doesn’t fully understand the expensive resources that Palantir is invested in. The commercial applications right now are mainly government in focus or lightly e-commerce, but it has much larger applications.

The areas I see potential growth into are places like medicine and drug discovery. But it could also go into areas like space exploration, engine optimization, etc. they’re currently working with Ferrari to optimize their engine. That’s literally how you win competitions—use big data.

I mean. I’m not worried. If I’m wrong (which I really, really, really don’t think I am), then at worse, I’ll maybe squeeze our 5% or 10% gains over the next year. If I’m right (which I am confident I am), then this could literally grow large enough to become part of FAANG.

It’s part of a paradigm shift that we are witnessing. Mobile created a paradigm shift. Self driving cars will create its own paradigm shift (he seems why Tesla had the run up).

**Big data, will, too, have its paradigm shift.**

Feel free to follow me if you’d like or keep in touch. But bear in mind, it could take years for this thesis to be proven. It took Tesla years. So take the risk seriously. But understand that this is not some vaporware company. This bitch ass company has the fucking heart of Silicon Valley pumping in its chest.

Let me put it this way. You like Elon Musk?

Fucking finally!
Plus we spend most of our young lives powerless in a state of want or lack, chasing things like money or women, developing the habit of indecision. We never even begin to really dream. Some people's "dream" is to have a consistent and reliable job that pays well. Sure, it's better than 99% of the world and it's less brutal than history and nature, but if that's your highest aspiration which seems like an impossibility, then what you're going to end up with is a lot less. Just a thought.

Good thing I grab 2 at a time to save actually walking back.
They are letting their inventories sell out intentionally, without replenishing because it frees up cash for them too. And it gets more people to have to order through their online portal, which makes their online numbers look better at the expense of the store numbers.  Sure there is record demand right now for games, but the low inventory is not an indication of a completely rosy story though.

Exactly. If you want the shares back, you can always just sell weekly cash secured puts at the same strike at which they got assigned away. Only "downside" is that the stock continues to pump, but you still keep the premium then rinse and repeat.

Profit taking because Biden wants to tax capital gains as income. Lots of people bought at $12-$20 and they would rather take the tax hit now than possibly pay 50% on the profits at their income level if the Dems take the senate.

Right now I just have the message that says my account has a deficit so I can’t buy anything else unless my value goes up or I deposit more. My only fear is if it tanks even lower and I’m margin called at the bottom for a even worse loss

What is oi? Open interest?
If you’re going to put anything anywhere, put it in my wife’s mouth. But beware her boyfriend, he is smart. constantly buys the dip.
I think PLTR is no longer a meme stock, instead its a long play. It’ll triple in a year. I’m buying every dip cuz I believe in the company. Do the same if you believe in PLTR 🚀🚀🚀🚀
the solution is to realize buying OTM call options makes the stock go up, and TSLA is expensive to short and then the shorts get blown out which adds fuel to the fire

We do things all wrong as humans. We destroy our bodies with bad shit when we're young and try to live healthy when we're older.. this is literally the worst way to do it. You should live healthy when you still have lots of life left to live, because it actually matters.. when i get old i'm legit gonna do coke, slam shots, and take steroids to get jacked.. because fuck it, not like i would have much time left to live anyways. Might as well enjoy it.. That's my philosophy. We're doing shit ass backwards.

Edit 2: God damnit, nope... Red. 😒

Edit 3: SAVED! Green signals! 😂

Edit 4: sorry guys. Pretty sure it's red. Saw another one... 🙃

Edit 5: oh fuking thank Lord Musk and Karp and Cohen - another green. This must be THE final signal. We're set! 🤣😂
It’s Tesla.  Tesla is not going to crash and burn and drop rapididly and stay down. Leaps are a safe bet with companies like Tesla Apple amazon Disney etc because they are strong and not likely to fail anytime soon so leaps give you a cushion for wild fluctuation.  Whatever Tesla is at now it may drop $20 in a day but in a month it will be higher than when you initial bought.  Getting long term leaps on strong well established companies is always a safe bet
That’s fine you got shares and aren’t under pressure of theta decay, IV crush etc. You’ll be in the green in 2021 probably sooner than you think.
That was my lunch money gamble bro
It fucking sucks.

I did this
Bruh don’t do it!
This. The less you all buy short term OTM options the better it will be for the share price. The goal, and it’s a lofty one, is to get this thing on the same level as TSLA. Not the same valuation or share price mind you, but rather a share price that continues to climb in the face of shorters, manipulators, wallstreet media hacks and MMs who are incentivized to make your options expire worthless. 

Just. Buy. God. Damn. Shares.

If the price drops look at it as an amazing opportunity to buy more on the cheap and be patient. This isn’t some boomer bullshit level patience of years and decades. I’m talking months here.

But hey, keep enriching wallstreet with ridiculous  yoloing into OTM calls and puts that are 99% likely not to print. PLTR is not a stock for this. You want TSLA god status. You have to get a good base going and that takes the retail masses to buy and buy more even when Shitron, JP Moron et al want to come out with their “analyst” garbage. Options aren’t going to do it. Stop it.
You forgot loss porn sir

you're really retarded lmao. Tesla could probably buy out legacy auto makers by then. Question is will it even be worth it? At this point, it's an unstoppable force. But hey if you believe it so much, why don't you short it with everything you have? just pick a very long time horizon so that you can stay solvent :)). If you truly believe tesla will go bankrupt or get bought with that much conviction, then you should definitely do it. There are no excuses

Bc the premium for it was up to like $100 at some point before I bought it. If its actually making a move by June I'll sell some on the bumps and let the rest ride. Most of my money is in shares rn so don't mind gambling a bit on commodities next year
I'm a retard but my understanding was you keep the commons and get warrants on merger.

From 2017-2019 the number jumped from 11m millionaires to 19m 50% increase. Some people would point to that as part of the administration.

50% is still a borderline majority and my point isnt that you need to make 400k its that in order to acquire wealth its best done by increasing the amount you make.

10% of 200-400k put in the bank will outperform the average investors by a large margin for a number of reasons. Namely cheap assets during down markets. 10% per year is not realistic. The s&p is returning 5.9% over the last 20.
Even turkeys fly in a hurricane. Wise for you young tards to remember that going forward.

I think he’s used WSB retards to pump and dump on. BUT getting out I don’t think is a sign “they don’t believe”. This is a long term play. Most expect by April. There’s good money to be made between now and then. He could make 10% then buy back in just in time to squeeze and bounce to the next stock.

Why are you going to throw in the towel so early? Your calls are not set to expire for several weeks. I would first see how Monday goes before you decide to give up hope. Last time PLTR crashed from $30 down to $23 per share and then shot back up. Anything can happen

2021 will be a “market of stocks” instead of a stock market.

at this point it's not even about money. You're just being a piece of shit here. You don't have to believe. Then just fucking don't no need to act like this.

You've taken it too far. Calm the fuck down.

And no, all your dumb reads will lead to nothing because at the end of the day, you'll see with your own eyes and you will be dumbfounded, not me. Remember for the rest of your entire life this: all your stupid conclusions that you came up with your stupid books will all be useless. Completely useless. And Tesla will succeed and prove you wrong again and again. Mark my words. Sure I don't expect you to believe that but by the time you understand this, it'll be too late anyways.

Hopefully the Karp interview helps rally the stock. I have Jan 1/22 27.5 calls and 1/29 $28 calls wonder if I should sell for about 50% loss on Monday. Can’t roll it over my account has a margin deficit holding 115 pltr shares maybe I should sell for now and buy in if it dips
Calls on my dick inside Konmari
Yikes. What have you been doing?
Buy put spreads after it spikes, 1-2 weeks out. I've done ok. Or buy calls farther out and wait for shit.
Fair enough. I'm a retail newbie so glad to hear it!
i guess i'm scared?
What happened to your other account bro? Lmao
Already out of stock probably because of wsb retards buying them
Ohhhh gotcha gotcha gotcha. No dude you had major grammatical errors in your original comment and multiple spaces next to each other—missing periods. Fuck me. You’re lucky I was even able to decipher the fact that you were writing in English.

The biggest value comes from not having to use traditional tablesets. You don’t have to name independent or dependent variables. The foundry system allows for associations to automatically be discovered.

My background is in front end web dev, not data, though I have done data scraping and am familiar with the tools of the trade.

**The immediate value (and commercial value) comes from the ability to upswell—that’s it.**

While your “Microsoft excel” sheet solution (showing your age a little bit there by not saying google sheets), may work for small potatoes, we’re talking companies where a $0.01 savings per sale makes millions of difference.

**A sophisticated neural network is going to be literal orders of magnitude more powerful than any excel sheet. I think you’d know that.**


They would be able to find associations that were just wild, wild, wild out of the box. Imagine all the data they gave? They would be able to use the security footage and be able to translate that data into sales. They could make assumptions based on your movements:

>“Oh shit, he touched the bananas, put them back, and NOW he has athletic shorts in his cart, QUICK send him an ad for Preparation H!”

It would be able to find random ass associations and be able to interpret wild conclusions based off of seemingly unrelated data. The system could show “yes for some reason people who touch bananas and then put them back and then later go to buy athletic shorts—but who take the long way through electronics to get there—have a 98% higher chance of purchasing preparation H when we give them an ad right then.”

I’m focusing on e-commerce because I think people can understand that well. But the applications are endless. Just imagine taking a picture of your face and looking at your bank statements and getting a confidence interval for the probability that you’re a terrorist? 

**Motherfucking Palantir 101**

Or drug creation? Palantir could work with Purdue and make, discover, and synthesize the next super opioid! All I see are $$$’s!

**The applications are really endless, and I shouldn’t have to justify myself.**

So what do you do for a living that makes *you* such a self-prescribed expert of the subject, exactly?
You should be averaging down brotha

Or a mortgage with a ballon payment
This is the way.
It depends on who’s backing your loan.  Federally backed loans have a number of options for repayment, depending on the backing organization.

I have a USDA backed loan, and am eligible for either a loan modification, where my missed payments are rolled into a new 30 year loan, or to add an additional interest free loan for the missed payments onto my existing loan, and pay as a balloon payment when I either sell, refinance, or pay off the loan.

You need to know which agency is backing your loan to know which repayment options are available.  

Your mortgage holder will absolutely try to give you false information.  I was told that I had to pay it back as a lump sum originally, and had to push back and let them know I was familiar with the provisions of the cares act before they relented and gave me more favorable options.

There’s a lot that needs fixing but if the CEO is not responsible then who is?
Guys, look, the stock is up 130% since 3 months. It simply can't grow every single day. Take a hike, or go cook your wife's boyfriend his favorite food, we need to have a long term view on this stock.

I've been eating so much garbage in December I can't wait to start this diet tomorrow.
I think the big question is if they can weasel themselves into being a pillar of systems that will collapse without them. My company has been using Oracle for decades, and is already worried about it's sunsetting in a few decades. Every system we have either built ourselves or get from someone else has to talk to Oracle. They could charge us whatever they want and we'd have to pay it.
It’ll go 100 in Q1 sometime maybe feb or March
If my shares get called away at $45 on Jan 29, I’ll be ok
My two biggest positions are TSLA and PLTR... TSLA has been like the rich uncle that just keeps giving while PLTR has been the annoying cousin that keeps needing to borrow more money. Basically, I’m constantly at breakeven and it’s frustrating.

I still believe in PLTR as a long term play but it sure is annoying watching everything go up except it...

Up probably 40% net of W/D. Taxable accounts down on the year due to me living off of them and my retirement accounts exploding higher - Roth IRA from ~75k to 180k and inherited IRA from 115k to ~210k. Biggest wins: PINS 45 Jan 2022 C bought @ ~1.20 per and TSM 70 Jan 2022 C bought when TSM was at 62. Considering quitting working entirely to trade as I am getting proceeds from a home sale (~250k net). Otherwise I go back to a 120k a year financial advisor job but they won’t let me trade.

It’s currently impossible to buy GME in 2020, so, the point’s kinda moot.
Actually the Indian reservation said fuck local laws and literally built a new garage to accommodate more people this year lol. I’ve gone like 8 times this month.
I noticed a car in my neighborhood doing the same thing for over a week. We had a heavy rain storm here a few days ago, there was a restoration team vacuuming the water out of the car yesterday.
I only watch movies. I don't care what it is, but it's a movie. TV, cartoons, whatever, the writing is too shit
All you have to do is say you have been or can be affected by the pandemic, ie hour cuts, pay cuts, furloughs. It also applies if you believe you can be affected by it and that's pretty hard to prove or disprove.

Shhh, darling we know.
do some research that doesn't involve stroking your confirmation bias. stoked for you if you've made money until now but tesla is a dog shit company with an insanely flawed product, shady business practices, and fraudulent capital raising schemes. if you actually give a fuck about mixing up your sources outside fucking youtubers give the book "Ludicrous" a read. if you want a short and sweet rundown listen to the smoking tire podcast with johnny lieberman and one with chris harris. the make good cars in many ways, but their time is coming. once you educate yourself you'll be as dumfounded and condescending as me with people who sound as crazy as you do. again, best of luck

so far, he's been slow but always still delivers. Compared to legacy auto makers, the track record is very positive. Remember that toyota still does not make a single EV... Not a single one...

> people realizing fsd might not even happen in our lifetime 

Tesla again is the closest to FSD. I mean if you know much about machine learning you'd know that. over 1 Billion miles of data is so much more useful than anything else... You cannot even compare... Literally. 

> we might just have to wait until they just go bankrupt when they lose the ev market to the legacy manufacturers. 

legacy automakers will start going bankrupt before tesla does... No need to believe me, just wait. These companies either have a vision or they don't. So far, it seems like they just cannot deal with the transitions very well... They much rather collect more profits by selling ICE cars...

So you be the judge. I can understand that you'd feel like Tesla is overvalued. But going bankrupt, you probably smoking some damn hot shit

You joke but I’ve been eyeing WISH and it’s possibly undervalued. We’ll have to wait until first earnings.
You never lose money selling CCs.
Worst case is you only have less gains than the lottery. 
Over time that's made up tho because you play smart and keep your sells high lowering your chance of assignment and increasing the number of times you sell till worthless.
I don't understand all this GME garbage. I'm all about the meme to the moon rocketship shit. But this company fucking sucks, it's run by retards and their employees are a bunch of fanboy neckbeards that would rather lose a sale than sell to the console they don't like.

You can't short game stop. This makes put call parity weird on the options and makes the prices abnormal. 

Besides this, 27-40 are so deep otm options, small changes in their price are random noise. Small changes in IV (or just a couple small buyers) would cause the prices to raise or lower

These are all so illiquid, your looking at random noise

Um this has to be illegal..
How though? Its an available option with no real negative consequences (besides slight temporary hit on credit) it just turns your 30 year loan basically into a 31 year loan. You get extra capital you can use to invest into the market and you can do a safe investment such as an etf if you are truly concerned. Just because it superficially sounds like a degenerate move doesn't mean  it actually is.

Not all us Tesla bears got ate haha.
what about french?
Yo no way fam, Mo City Gang!!
Yes, that’s true, but they just don’t have the engineering talent, reputation, time in the space, and contracts that Palantir has.

**You could compare it to YouTube.**

I could try to explain YouTube to someone who’s never seen it and they might say, “well that’s great, but isn’t it dangerous that other companies like Apple can just copy and do exactly the same thing?”

**Well, yes and no.**

This is an area that requires such expertise and such specific information and knowledge, that it will be impossible (or next to impossible) for any company to catch up. Outsiders would not in any way be able to do what Palantir does. Google? Maybe. Facebook? Maybe. Microsoft? Maybe. But any other company?—No.

I had close friends of mine at Stanford (back in 2013/2014) who turned down jobs at google and Facebook to be able to intern and later work at Palantir. They hired top, top, top talent. I mean, god-tier autistic talent.

This isn’t something that you can just “clone.” There’s a reason why nobody has “cloned” google. There’s a reason why when Facebook tried to “clone” Snapchat, it failed.

Cloning companies certainly plays its role. But this is an area that requires extreme expertise and that will have unparalleled repercussions.

I simply do not believe that another company will be able to go toe-to-toe with Palantir and offer the value that they provide. IBM is the closest “competitor” if you even want to call it that. This company is real.

You don’t have to believe me. In fact it probably hurts me more if you do. Because all the fucking Calls on this stock keep fucking up it’s natural movements!

**But I digress—do what you want. Eat my asshole, don’t eat my asshole. It’s all the same to me, man.**

Follow me if you want. Or don’t.

Remindme! 6 months “I was right.”

70-80% on swing trades

Couple of losses, some penny stocks. Gained on that G N U S run back in June though.

Some regrets on selling early such as MRNA (Bought at $22), Solo (of course it rockets right after I sell lol), LSPD.to (Had at $12), biggest regret ENPH (had an avg $38, then panic sold all of it after that short report).

Overall, fantastic year. Let’s see what 2021 bring.

Edit: Oh gained 100% on TTD too
What’s funny is that the market has been up the last month but meme stocks are down. Boomers won December.

the problem isnt the fats. the problem is carbs tend to be absorbed first as a fuel source. when the carbohydrates are absorbed, fats are stored. and do all the things you talked about earlier.

if youre burning 2000 calories in training twice daily it really doesnt matter.

TSLA puts.
Another $100 in the retard pot
I just got into the market in December. Lost $150 total so far buying and selling within days early on and now I’ve made longer term buys and options in industries I’m familiar with or stocks I feel solid about. Put in an extra $1000 to turn on margin investing when these options expire next month. 

Biggest one I’m looking to pay off is an ACB $10.5 Put. Fundamentals and leadership look like shit. Recent pump scares me about speculators buying cheap cannabis stock but long term these guys are not solid in my humble, noob, poor and angry budtender opinion. 

Canadian cannabis market benefits from the lack of grey area the US has put the cannabis business in, but the real market for the massive amount of bulk they were producing at the start of the year isn’t there yet. 

If you’ve read this far and are interested in US cannabis stock I would implore you to read the info I have. I am only a budtender, meaning I’m the salesperson when you walk into a dispensary, but I am on the high end of the bell curve in understanding the US cannabis business. Only reason I feel inclined to write this out is because of the insanity of the rise in ACB today and I drank a bottle of champagne for New Years. Here’s to yours.

Cannabis companies pay a special tax form because it is not federally legal and currently pay higher taxes than they will once cannabis is legalized. Due to the business not being federally legal, there are many things cannabis companies can not write off, negatively affecting their net. 

THC tax rate in Colorado is 25.93%z Majority of dispensaries shove the tax onto the consumer. There are some companies that eat the tax and post out the door pricing instead of pre tax pricing. The one I work for does this and it looks like an infrastructure buildup and sell once cannabis is federally legal. 

A Biden administration is promising and so is the recent House legalization bill, but Republican senators are retards. If Biden looks to clean up his legacy, especially since he is one of the people directly responsible for the super criminal rhetoric long ago and marijuana incarceration, he will federally legalize cannabis in this term and add clemency or forgiveness for small amounts of pot or whatever it’s called.

Currently credit card companies and banks cannot work with cannabis companies, at least in Colorado. I assume it’s the same in California, Oregon and Washington. When cannabis is federally legalized, credit card processing companies will have a marked increase in transactions afterwards.

Livwell is a company based in Colorado that looks promising if they IPO. Looking to sell value, consistent pot with grow houses in Colorado and Michigan afaik.
Gotta post some dick pics

> There is one caveat. While forbearance won’t affect your official credit score, lenders will be able to see that you were or are in forbearance and they may, if they want, consider that fact in deciding to give you future loans.

ARKG why is it drop today
In real world applications I think there are more factors than just weight, which both the vehicle manufacturers and tire companies account for (or will start to since EV is starting to take off). But I agree a heavier vehicle, provided all other things constant, would wear a tire more quickly due to increase in friction.

I'd have to say the load rating is related to life span though. If you were to overload your tires, they risk running in an underinflated state, which leads to increased edge-wear, and increased friction, and heat generation- contributing to premature wear in both internal and external aspects. Thus the amount of weight on the tires does directly affect the tires life span.

Retail bidders.  MMers price in big spreads.  Stock sells off, MMer bid/asks on OTM drop, spreads go wider as IV increases, retail comes in and closes the gap a little competing for sellers.  You'll notice this happens in farther OTM strikes, particularly on the call side.

If you wanna make money consistently on GME options, sell very close to the money puts just below the ask, sell way OTM CCs at opportune times when it's pushing higher and IV has ramped.  Those you can sell even below the midpoint, since the bids are often already well above where a MMer bid would be (like a 1/15 $30 call at $0.34 on the bid when a MMer would have a $0.25 bid).

I watched all the bids on strikes for 1/15 today that were at $25 and above being bid pretty high.  Far too high, IMO.
That gash in the middle reminds me of your wife.

Is your point that there should also be news stories about the Chinese government allowing some % of the population to live outside of concentration camps? That doesn't seem particularly newsworthy. Or is it that the government should not be criticised for incarcerating certain members of society solely based on ethnicity and religion, provided there are a good number of people who aren't locked up? 

It isn't anti-Islam sentiment from the Chinese government that makes the news, it's the fact that they're living in labor camps and, allegedly, being treated like dogs whilst undergoing eugenics. Have you thought about why you're blinkering yourself to the grotesque inhumanity of these camps to focus only on whether the CCP is anti-Islam?

Sat next to this young guy that was so drunk the dealer called nearly every play to the pit boss. Mf split 10s repeatedly and kept winning.

Yep, this is true. Have an FHA Loan and the first thing I did was go on forbearance back in April. Haven't paid since and don't need to until April 2021. No penalty, just an additional year of payments. Best loan you'll ever get.

Yeah man I’ve got 2022 and 223 calls.  Super cheap and theta gang still winning that one.
I can tell you if 90% of buyers of one product are buying another product using some basic ass formulas in  Microsoft excel. Given that was your only example of machine learning tells me you don't know what the fuck you're taking about.
There are AIs watching that are set up by big companies that will scarf up anything that's underpriced.
Roth 28k to 60k, mostly by buying Z and TAN in April and May.

Trading account 1k to 27k. Shorted Expedia and LVS and SPY during the crash, longed Expedia and Z calls on the ride back up, (but also lost a bunch shorting SPY and IWM after they started recovering.) Made an absolute killing shorting HTZ after that retarded run-up. Traded sideways for a while, then got some big wins with Upwork calls. Then rode some EV SPACs to some absurd gains. Still don't know what a SPAC is.

Would be another 6k higher if I didn't repeatedly mistime shorting NKLA. Fuck NKLA so much.

What is PLTR? Never heard of it
Can you elaborate on what "dead' means in this context?

Did they get delisted on most major exchanges or go down 99% and stay there fluctuating wildly on that last 1% like penny stocks?

Can you cite specific alts (assuming it isn't going flag the comment)?
Give it a rest bro
I put big bucks into icln today expecting it to rip ahead of ga runoff. Hoping people looking to put money to work see it as safer given dem sweep will be bad for basically everything else
It’s the right excuse?

All it takes is one tweet and I just happened to be holding some puts when the autismo supreme tweeted ‘tsla stock price is too high imo’. I still love you Elon 🌈🐻
Gamble my whole portfolio on weekly options.
This. PLTR is legit. But wont be an overnight winner. I dont know shit about options but I know that medium term shares are going to be worth more than they are today.

yeah, just wait til 2021-2022 when the tech/equity bubble bursts, you'll be stuck holding the bag and commodities holders will be laughing all the way to the bank.

Ohhhhhhhh so this is why you’re butthurt. Because you literally FOMO’d into Palantir when it was at its first ATH. 😂😂😂

Sorry for your loss bro. Based on your comments though, you don’t seem to know very much of what you’re doing. I take it you didn’t make any gains this year?

Maybe you’d do better if you didn’t just have a portfolio of completely meme stocks that you chased after like an out of touch boomer? Over here saying I have a meme portfolio when you FOMO’d your ass into ARK and don’t know what they do.

**You should sell your Palantir now because you don’t deserve the gains.**

Actually, do it. Seriously do it. Because you literally fucked yourself by buying at the highest point and then getting mad at everyone else who made money because you were chasing the crowd rather than leading the pack.

*Good luck with your life dude. You’re a grade A loser.*

Absolutely yes, my thoughts are market uncertainty makes a near term correction happen. The fact is status quo is by far the best scenario for this market. If Biden was able to get his monetary policy through the senate it would likely helps less fortunate folks and really hurt the stock market.

GME, PLTR - you mean to say losses?
Nope get your facts straight. They weren't flagged. They are granted permission.  Use your words carefully
They can’t don’t anything if it’s a Reddit ban tho
PLTR is a great company that was priced pretty fairly to start... that’s the story.

Hopefully it just hangs around 23-26 for awhile and grows slowly from there

Don't get carried away, now.
There is rebalancing going on, lots of people selling/taking profits and re-investing after the new year. You'll start seeing significant price movements once they start announcing increases in steel scrap and moreso quarterly earnings for the steel companies. Commodities are slower to move than your typical pump-and-dump equities, but are much safer bets in the late stages of inflation.

The funniest part about woke arguments isn’t how singleminded or cliche they are - it’s the fact that that they are always articulated in the most sanctimonious way possible. It’s like hipsters stopped giving way too much of a shit about coffee, and got into artisanal politics. 

Fucking cool your shit, nobody on an anonymous board about trading meme stocks cares about your ostentatiously enlightened views, dropped without relevant context in a thread about dumb jokes. You are attempting to impress people who are rolling their eyes at you, not because they’re evil or stupid, but because they see through you. They see someone who parrots talking points they’ve read on Reddit, to the point that it seems their entjre education might in fact consist of comment threads on Reddit. Maybe you are not that person, but there’s no evidence to the contrary. 

I hope you are just really young, man.

China has been doing that for years. We just haven't had the courage to respond. Getting delisted? Good. Not far enough.
My bad. I thought your question was why did IV change but not the price.
“The 1992 Indian stock market scam was a market manipulation carried out by Harshad Mehta and other bankers and politicians on the Bombay Stock Exchange. The scam caused significant disruption to the stock market of India, with over one billion USD defrauded.

Techniques used by Mehta involved having corrupt officials signing fake cheques, market loopholes, and lies to drive the prices of stocks up to 40 times their original price. Stock traders making good returns as a result of the scam were able to fraudulently obtain unsecured loans from banks. When the scam was discovered in April 1992, the Indian stock market collapsed, and the same banks suddenly found themselves holding millions of INR in now useless debt.”

If anyone is bored, here is the Indian Jordan Belfort you can look into.
AAL was a sure vaccine rumor ATM for a while but it seems to have stabilized a bit since actual vaccine came out. Buy calls at $10, buy puts at $15. WKHS is another one perpetually bouncing between 20 and ~28 but premiums and IV swing too wildly to consistently profit before the IV juice wears off.
Pltr, and PayPal? This kinda makes me even more inclined to think you just wanna suck Thiel's erect cock

Do you spit or swallow?
Sounds like a meme movie.
I would be more concerned if it was a clinical trial which rose shares, but since it was a professional science article it has more credibility. The fact that they also got dr. Chaubey who has gotten previous FDA approval in this field and vanguard securing position makes it very appealing. I understand the downside risk and of course put it only what i would be prepared to lose
why do you need exact positions? the guy is holding stock and saying he's going to see huge growth. don't take his word for it, if you fact-check the steel industry news articles that have been coming out lately, it supports everything he's saying.

It was 123456. But I was insulted by the gains.
that website literally says there are 67 million shares sold short as of november 30. obviously there is a bug where it says 0% is shorted. Gamestop is currently the most shorted stock on the market.

Yeah that sounds reasonable to have as an external target with which they intend to be assessed on by Wall Street. But as an internal stretch goal 1M could be doable

carbohydrates for non athletes are the leading cause of weight gain and bloodsugar spikes. its not filling and you end up eating more often.

ketogenic diet is actually good for inactive people as they stay full longer and eat less out of habit.

rules for the average body do not apply to professional athlete bodies

they eat carbs because they are absorbed easily and can be used a fuel faster. 

they also eat a lot of protein and fat.

basically athletes get away with a lot more.

high fat diets do not inherently lead to 'clogged arteries' or higher bad cholesteral levels.

thats old school.

To each their own. I’ve been in since dpo. I’m aware of the company and their capabilities. I think they have huge potential. That being said people might see it different. I’m not pumping, I’m not selling. People are worried about lock-up expiring and limited earnings info. This to me is a long term investment, some might be only in the short term. I will give this time to develop.
I’d run through a brick wall and take a bullet for you. Let’s fucking go!!
It's a fucking scam and you know it. The only reason the price is above $0 is because idiotic retail investors have soaked up the liquidity. If I remember right the management is taking 10 mill + salary while losing money which cannot be tracked. They are a growth company that has decreasing revenue. By any metric a rational person would see that this is a fraud and will never be profitable.

Bers? Havnt heard thst term in months
Well the market is pricing in a 2% move for next week, then volatility contracts the week after so I think so yeah.
Don’t forget these articles are also paired against year end reports stating steel imports down 22%, 33% Lower production capacity, multiple mine closures, regulatory adjustments, shipping delays, scrap adjustments, etc.   This is a very complex and regulated market, where margin and debt are king.  It is very hard to evaluate how an increase in price would correspond to a share price because of the sheer number of things that dictate that end product price.  This is also why earning are important, you will start to see who was in a position to capitalize on these increases.


I'll leave you with a statement from $MT's CEO on their half year report.


*"Although industrial activity has begun to rebound from April lows, and steel demand is also recovering, 2020 is likely to see steel consumption decline almost 20% year-on-year. Demand is not anticipated to fall as low as seen in 2009 but the decline is expected to undo almost all of the growth seen since then. While destocking during 2019 and 2020 will support a rebound in demand next year, this collapse in demand will mean a significant decline in profitability from the Company’s largest market. Underlying steel demand in the United States has been similarly impacted by the fall-out from the COVID-19 pandemic, with manufacturing output down significantly year-on-year in April and May.*

*While output increased in May from the April low, taken together, automotive output was still down 84% year-on-year over the two months, machinery output was down 23%, metal products output was down 14%, while construction was less affected, remaining close to 2019 levels. While the Company expects output and steel demand to rebound during the second half of the year, consumption will likely decline between 15% and 20% in 2020, negatively impacting the Company’s deliveries and profitability.*

*Chinese steel demand to be broadly stable in 2020 over the previous year, similar to its expectations pre-pandemic.
However, demand is eventually expected to decline as infrastructure spending has been front-loaded and real estate
demand structurally weakens due to lower levels of rural-urban migration. If this does not coincide with renewed capacity closures, this is expected to have a negative impact on steel prices and spreads."*

Now compare this with what actually took place.
Beautiful

For 2021 I will try to fuck at least 1 woman. I'm currently 0/5 the last 5 years, but I am convinced this is my year.
Russian Roulette to see if next year will be better is the only way to approach things when the ball drops to 0.

First year trading stocks, Made 100k in march, lost it all, built back up from there on spacs and planned out options plays, ended the year at nearly +70k with a 130k net worth at 18 years old... probably gonna drop to under 100k after taxes though.
I’ve been on a bit of a roll with AMZN. If it doesn’t tank on Monday the roll will continue.

You gonna buy any more calls? or you think its gonna dip. Guess that's sort of a magic 8 ball question.
Thanks for this!

This is fantastic. Basically asking the sub to buy and hold. Wish the certificates they issue monthly could be stacked as well, but those expire each month and these are certificates from points earned.
Glenfarclas are my favourite distillery in Scotland. Big fan of their whiskys. Got a couple of the family cask selection recently and looking to eventually get them all. From 1983 to ‘97. So far 1991 and 92 are in the locker. Can’t wait. 

One of the more table friendly drams is Glenfarclas 10 yr, easy drinking compared to the 105 it goes down like apple juice.

Even if he felt like he should "ride the wave" at least takeout half of the profits and just cash out.

Even if he felt "I can do more!" you cash out 115k you're still up 105k and you lose nothing.

Truuuu, but Jermar Jefferson ran over us like he was Dalvin Cook playing in a high school game.
If he loses he still definitely made 10s of millions of dollars, at the very least just from the pay per views. He’s also retired and this is an exhibition he came out of retirement for, so I don’t think he’s even planning on continuing to box professionally outside of money fights like this one. 


Also he’s arguably the greasiest boxer ever, he’s not gunna lose. 


He also said he made 100 mill off the boxing match with mcgregor
Edit: He’s _A fricken American_
Pretty sure it's going to last forever, given the sheer amount of fully demoralized subhumans who have allowed themselves to be cucked.
It's just a V shape recovery is all.
60% Gain for 2020.  100k to 160k.   Most of the gains were from TSLA and SEDG with some SPY and other index funds.  Got burned on biotech and cut my losses and won't touch again.  Biggest single % gain was RCII.  Some guy on here posted some good DD and it paid off.  Only regret not throwing more into it.  

Biggest thing I did was rolled 100k from my 401k broker account into my own account to manage.  Quit paying fees and could actively manage it myself.  Left a big portion of my retirement with my broker so I wouldn't lose it all in case I was stupid and he only gained 10% and I did 60% on my own with help from you guys.

Happy New Years retards!!!!
Holy shit you’re right

Simple wager. Deal ends in June 30, 2021 and we look at the price thin that date. You said yourself it was going to delist within 6 months, so I don’t know what you’re so worried about. Stop wasting my time. Take the deal or don’t, boomer. Either way, get fucked. Because legitimately I’m upset that the United States allows people that dumb to walk the street.

Have any of you autists found a pattern with one stonk that consistently paid? Like riding a wave where you bought calls/shares hit your mark - then switch to puts hit your mark back down and repeat for an extended period of time. 

I think I found a pattern and want to experiment. Curious if anyone has personally had any success with a similar strategy.
Nope, that was me ✌️😎

I'm gonna hate to blindly take $1000 from you when in the best case scenario it's gonna get decimated in stock price. So if it's gets delisted, you don't get more max pain in your dirty butthole.

Without paywall: https://www.bloombergquint.com/markets/nyse-to-delist-chinese-telco-giants-on-u-s-executive-order

Outline.com didn't work on this one

------

(Bloomberg) -- The New York Stock Exchange said it will delist three Chinese corporations to comply with a U.S. executive order that imposed restrictions on companies identified as affiliated with the Chinese military.

China Mobile Ltd., China Telecom Corp Ltd., China Unicom Hong Kong Ltd will be suspended from trading between Jan. 7 and Jan. 11, and proceedings to delist them have started, according to a statement by the exchange.

The three companies have separate listings in Hong Kong. All generate the entirety of their revenue in China and have no meaningful presence in the U.S. except for their listings there.

U.S. President Donald Trump signed an order in November barring American investments in Chinese firms owned or controlled by the military, in a bid to pressure Beijing over what it views as abusive business practices. The order prohibited U.S. investors from buying and selling shares in a list of Chinese companies designated by the Pentagon as having military ties.

The Chinese Foreign Ministry later accused the U.S. of “viciously slandering” its military-civilian integration policies and vowed to protect the country’s companies. Chinese officials have also threatened to respond to previous Trump administration actions with their own blacklist of U.S. companies.

The executive order has resulted in a series of companies being removed from indexes compiled by MSCI Inc., S&P Dow Jones Global Indices and FTSE Russell.

Global exchanges, including NYSE and Nasdaq Inc., courted Chinese companies during the past decade as they attempted to expand their IPO business, particularly in the internet sector. In response, Hong Kong Exchanges & Clearing Ltd. changed its rules in recent years to lure back listings, including allowing share sales by companies with weighted voting rights -- strengthening the power of company founders at the expense of weaker protections for minority investors.

Companies including e-commerce giants Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and JD.Com Inc., which already had listings in New York, conducted secondary listings in Hong Kong in the past two years as the trade war between the U.S. and China intensified.
I made like 13 grands this week from Alibaba calls so I’m feeling like a dollar store WB🥶

The stock market became a necessity to me when my business was shuttered because of COVID. I'm naturally a risk adverse person and something as big, fast, and complex as the stock market isn't where I want to be. If I didn't have you guys to turn it into a joke and break it down into smaller, manageable pieces I don't think I'd have made it.

Godspeed, Christian soliders. I hope 21 is even gayer.

Next week is obviously going to be volatile with the Georgia runoffs. Bears are going to crawl out of their shitholes, jerk each other off and we’ll see a lot of “I told you so” comments and dancing bear posts. 

__DO NOT LET THEM FOOL YOU__ The following week, we’re going to see green dildos as tall as skyscrapers. Trillions will come pouring into the markets. Bears will be wiped clean because they’re too dumb to take profits and once again be fuk. Bulls will once again reign supreme and ARK, PSTH, PLTR and yes TSLA will soar to the heavens.
Anyone else have spxu
by losing it this year he realized the losses for this year and can offset any gains.

Gas food and half of rent. The rest is a nice little conversation piece.
in general once a ticker reaches critical mass with every other post mentioning it on the sub the trade is too crowded and what you have is a bunch of late-comers and people who bagheld too long hoping for a second miracle pump. PLTR was being spammed constantly throughout all of december but in reality the move was done in late november and everything since then has been theta burn/dump with a couple of fake pumps that were quickly reversed within a day or so.

See also: NIO and other chinese EV plays.

Appreciate all the DD you have done, but I just researched the details of the Gamestop membership program. In the settings you can choose STOCKPILE points instead of automatically redeeming the 5 dollar coupon every month.

In the TERMS AND CONDITIONS: PowerUp Rewards points are valid for one year from date of posting to the Member's Account provided the Member remains active in the Program. "Active" is defined as making at least one purchase or trade in every 12-month period. If at least one qualifying purchase or trade is made every 12 months, the expiration date of the accumulated points is extended for 12 months from the date of the qualifying purchase. If a qualifying purchase or trade is not made within 12 months, all accumulated points shall be forfeited and the Account is subject to closure at GameStop's discretion.

In short, you can save the points for a year by choosing stockpile, they expire after 1 year, unless you make a purchase and then the timer is reset.

Tesla didn't turn a profit for so long because the automotive industry is literally one of the worst industries to be in. Software is so fucking easy to be profitable, when the cost of additional licenses is as close to 0 as possible, only shit tier companies like PLTR could be this bad at it.

PLTR has about 1,000 competitors, all hungry to eat their lunch. Their software is not special, it doesn't do jack shit that anyone else can't do, it's a big shit nugget that is not unique in the slightest

And with a grain of salt, their P/E is negative and forecast  to not turn a profit for 3 years (however that's figured)

Still have some money left to lose in 2021, Game is still on.

if youve been trading a while this wont be the first time you blow up your account. it happens. sucks but make more money and keep at it or just rope. i blew up 2 six figure accounts this year but w,e im in my 20s ill be back soon enuf.
Visited family this past week for the first time in ages. Gotta admit, has helped my mental state dramatically. 

Made it back home for New Years and while I'll be alone for this, my time with them was worthwhile and I'll cherish that. I hope you guys have a good time with or without others.
Pump and dump stock, already had a +500% run off a short squeeze since Nasdaq gave them a 180 day extension to meet guidelines to stay in the Nasdaq
I was conflicted so I just commented
Presumably before you wreck yourself
Why do these numbers not sound accurate at all 🤔
Yeah I dont pay people to stop annoying me.  I walk away.
Stripe or Bloomberg. Although, it would be a dream if Ackman intends on grabbing up Robinhood since all the memelords will inflate the value of the stock by name association alone.
Dear Reginald:

1900 was a tumultuous year. I had the plague, wiped my posterior with rocks and Chad worthington III is quite the ass, but my robinhood broke even.

I have to agree... I have no idea why people are buying a brick and mortar video game shop... Its like they rocketed back into gear 2000 or something.. I've been buying video games on steam since at least 2010, eggs is gamestop?!

Ru Paul da man.
Then move out and change all of what you just said.  Yeah paying rent and bills sucks but you can’t put a price on improved mental health and consistent peace of mind.  Trust me, its worth it.  Find a place that’s month to month to start out with so that way you’re not locked in to anything for an extended period and can always move back if things go south.  You got this fam.

Nah there’s a link between parental age and autism. Moreso at 40+, but still. I took care of them kids and no way I want that man. It’s something you gotta consider. Worse case I gotta freeze my sperm. I’m a dude.

Can i reach out to you occasionally for mutual support? (no homo)
Despite all the problems seen in North America, which is honestly superficial at best, would still prefer it over the ccp any day. All governments will have pros and cons. However, the cons in the ccp by far outweigh the pros and these pros are mostly in the hands of government, not to the benefit of the people for the most part, by and large.

yes because i feel like that's ultimately the safest way but i would first need to get enough to get the captial for the 100 shares. that's why i will admit i sounded hypocritical because even though i called YOLOs autistic i do have to realize that because my capital is what it is, to get to that next step will probably be through a YOLO in some form

I've had 100k from an old 401k in spy for about 5 years and it barely moves. I think I'm up a total of like 50k in all that time.
I think everyone knows this lol it's all about the bubble these few months
All girls are that type of girl bro.
Its about the long term goal even if it drops back to 2 gotta realize their FDA approval and research paper is making it appealing.
GME not GMI, SI is 130% of total float and 250% of available float rn

Don’t add more, just chill with what you got and see how it pans out.
I decided not to include unknowns like that because banking on those esp with short dated calls would be retarded. obviously if that happens, squeeze would happen sooner

The space pump comes to mind, bloomberg said the call buying drove up share prices. It also happened with those billions in calls on qqq.. They explained it better than me of course
What? Equities and time easily makes assets. If you invest in equities, which averages over 10%, you can become a millionaires in 26 years putting away 10k a year into the S&P. You need waaaaay under 400k a year to put away 10k a year. Most people have more than 26 years of working life, and could sink 10k into their 401k for a good part of that. 

There are 11 million millionaires in the US. Thats 3.28% of the United States. 1.8% of the population make over 400k. So even if every 400k+ earner is a millionaires, which is unlikely, roundly half the people with a million dollars make under 400k. I said most, but its at least near half.

Edit: only 1% make over 500k, so given a progressive tax system, majority of millionaires would see no or very minimal tax increase. Many sane millionaires would approve.

the year before that was a -3k loss. and then year before that a -2k loss.

i'm clearly not good at this. but i also don't wanna be a quiter

IRS sets up a tax schedule, where he pays what he can (with interest  added on.) 

They they have a 90k loss in 2021, they get to deduct that loss from all future stock gains, and up to 6k each year for the next 15 years.  So if he make 90k in 2021 from trading, then he will pay no taxes on those gains.  If he never makes any stock market gains, then he gets to deduct 6k a year from his income for the next 15 years.  or a sliding scale between the 2 until he deducts that total 90k in losses.
I’m not saying just park it all in shares. ETFs just provide a relatively stable and predictable underlying to leverage with options. While the memes may go up 20% one day and down 50% the next, you can be pretty sure spy/qqq is gonna go up about 4-5% a month or so and you can use options to magnify that into larger gains for you. With my leaps I’m getting about 5x leverage on spy and qqq and am often positive even when the underlying is slightly red. If you generate 8-10% a month you’re more than doubling your money every year. If you start with 100k you’re a millionaire within 4 years.
I hope it’s Stripe, Robinhood, or Coinbase. You?
I did thnink that when I made it.  Then in 2 weeks it was back to gambling.

Look at this way /u/ethbagholder it could have been a lot worse, you could have had 230k going into january and lost it all that month, then have to pay 50k+ in taxes.
They sell it to keep it in balance you autistic apes
God damn. That’s probably the most retarded comment here.

Take it on the chin. I am sitting on massive losses. I have high blood pressure from years of abuse and no job
Don't let GOOGL win by paying them
It's gonna squeeze like JWN, and settle in the mid-30s. Also it has 11 dollars of cash per share so it's likely to not go below that. The second part is why I'm saying good luck
You didn’t think once you had 100k you’d put it into a safer route?
News to me, I'm an indian guy and I didn't know this.
I’m hoping so, but happy to hold throughout the year to see what happens, not abandoning ship that quick

Idk I can’t advise on what you should do. Go with your gut
Retail manager here, stores typically have enough on hand to cover expected sales growth vs last year. Selling out means you exceeded expectations and have allready made more money than you were planning to make. Its easy enough to restock over a few days as well.
I was professional “CS GO player” in my head, that didnt end well good! But again, my trading career is actually doing worse, so ty for a reward! Happy new year, wish you more tendies less stress!!!

Anyone in $RDFN or $CRSP? Pleas console me.
**Here is a direct quote from a previous comment I’ve made briefly explaining *some* of the inherent value being Palanir:**

<quote>

Large data sets are the future of pretty much everything. Once you have a large enough data set and a powerful enough computer, you can use machine learning algorithms to find associations within the data. There’s no need to create table sets. There’s no need to assign independent or dependent variables. There’s no need to sift through for confounding variables. There’s no need to assume where the association may lie. It just *does it.*

It takes large data sets and is able to make magic out of them—Palantir offers this ability as a service for companies. They can create specialized CRMs (customer relationship management tools) that allow companies to better track customers. Better sell to them. Better up sell them. Why do you think your fucking Facebook ads work so well? Machine learning dumb ass.

You think Walmart is smart enough to do what Facebook does? Eat my asshole, fuck face. No they don’t. That’s where daddy Palantir comes in. They create custom tools to manage that data and find relationships that Walmart didn’t know exists. Oh shit, 90% of all customers who buy adult diapers also buy vanilla Bacardi rum?! Holy fuck. Liquor revenue up 30% this year thanks to Palantir. You see what I’m saying?

It goes way beyond anything you guys could comprehend. Ferrari? They’re doing optimized data to increase the efficiency of the engine, the traction on the tires, and the aerodynamics of the car. You want to win a race? Put data on your side, bitch.

**You ever seen Money Ball?**

Well just imagine having the autistic fucker from that film, played by Jonah Hill, but on your payroll and as a SaaS.

Eh. Honeslty I think he gets a bad rap. He has done a great job righting the ship. Classic boomer turn around, I wouldn't bet on him 100% 180ing into a new company but we got RC for that now.
Ride it into Valhalla, this fucker is going down the tubes when those shares unlock. Entire bid volume down to $260 was only like 6,000 shares today... When they unlock 30M+ this is definitely going under 240. I actually think it might go under 200, everyone knows this valuation is obscene and none of these investors (who paid $10-120 per share) are going to want to watch their gains wither further. They'll all be racing for the door, and we'll be rich 🤑

I'm trying to make a million. That'll take 40 years in ETF'S. I know memes are risky but I'm willing to take the risks. If I lose it then my life will just remain shitty.

The hope of making it outweighs just continuing my life down this path for 20 more years. If I lose what I currently have invested in memes literally nothing changes. I can just save more and continue my mundane existence.

Breakeven point only matters at the very moment of expiration. It's what you paid for the option, plus the strike.

It's saying, if you exercised this contract to buy the shares for the strike price, then immediately sold them, you would only make an overall profit if the share price is over that break even point, since the option's initial cost is essentially adding to the price you're purchasing the shares at.

Up until expiration the option has additional value that represents time(theta) and volitility(vega)

My entire portfolio of my play account is 5k in pltr shares and 5k of gme shares both are 50% margin.  I need both to start going up I don’t want to have a conversation with my wife why I’m transferring money out of our bank account.

I don’t mess with leaps so I can’t advise on what you should do. I lost my ass royalty in the beginning of the year trading options and have done so much better day trading and swing trading regular stock. I think we are due for a reversal next week due to the big over reaction sell off today but obviously only time will tell.

Up 8.8K, 22%. Started trading and getting vaccinated in the latter part of this year. If my paper hands didn’t kick in today, I could’ve bought my NVIDIA spread back for much cheaper than I did and would be up another 10K. 

My account was down to 5K at one point. Last five weeks I’ve learned credit spreads and I’m not looking back. Currently sitting at 48K with a credit spread on NVDIA that I rolled over, and three puts on TSLA. 
Thanks for everything this year, wouldn’t have learned the power of credit spreads if I didn’t lose 30K to TSLA to start my trading career.

The only thing I don't agree with is the timeline starting around March. I think the possibilities of new ownership regarding Cohen will cause a squeeze by or before then. From his tweets today, and his comments and activity throughout this month, it doesn't seem like he is content to passively be involved in this process. But this is quite minor of a detail, and no one really knows. Thanks for the post and DD! Gme to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

My NY resolution is to pay half of my 450k mortgage this year.

Uh... the stock closed at almost 29/share last week. One week of dip after a 200%+ runup in the previous 2 months isn’t usual.

Why it’s been plateauing is probably because the early investor share lockup ends sometime between January and March, so we shouldn’t expect rocket moves until that lockup ends realistically.

Everything you said is literally what every boomer has said about Tesla circa 2017:

“Never turned a profit,”

“High float,”

You sound like a gay bear dude. Go ahead and do what gay bears do man. What about putting your money where your mouth is though? If you’re so certain that it’s going to get delisted (😂😂😭💀) then why don’t you go ahead and make a simple wager?


I’m not shilling. I actually hate what they do. But I’m betting 100% on a dystopian future dumbass. Because Edward Snowden already blew the lid on shit and the asswipe is getting charged for treason.

Yeah bro: my bet is 100% on the dystopian future that Palantir will create. You said that it names it’s products after comic book icons and Lord or the rings tropes like it’s a bad thing—so what?

What’s next, you’re gonna criticize Elon Musk for his trolly naming tactics, too? Or are you just some wannabee value trader who doesn’t know shit about the Tesla or Elon and only bought after your boomer broker said it was a buy?

**Peter Thiel is fucking Elon Musk 2.0 and I can’t wait till he is shitting tendies on your sad boomer ass.**

Like I said dude, you’re straight up not as smart as me, and I think that threatens / angers you. Do you want to have a serious conversation about *why* Palantir has value? Because if you do, it may take hours. I’ll have to teach you about Tensor Flow, how machine learning algorithms work, and some of their applications in medicine, some of the applications in protein folding, the applications in counter-terrorism, how CRMs work, how e-commerce a/b testing flows work, how upwelling in tech flows works—and then on top of all that, how Palantir plays a role in all of those applications.

**this is be like trying to explain a lightbulb to a caveman.**

You’re over here saying:

>*”light bulbs are inefficient and have no utilitarian, consumer use! Kerosene is the future!”*

Okay dumbass, if you’re so confidently right, then who replaces Palantir? IBM? Are you forreal?

Depends on your situation. I assume your parents live there full time too? If it’s enough space for you to have your own thing and have privacy I say go for it, you save a ton of money. But if it’s something where they’re always in your business and you can’t have people over easily, 100% not worth it
Feel the same way.  Only up around 100% after a rough start being down 50%.  I was sure some stocks would rebound, they did, but if I had just bought out of the money instead of in the money leaps I would be up 500% plus
Jeeze those are some weird voodoo dicks.

Wrong. Its yachtS. Psth is going to go fucking nuclear. Idk your strike but as long as it is reasonable you are going be itm by march. Imo you exercise those and hang on for the real launch at warrant transfer (assuming it hasnt happened by march)
Why get married when you can just get rich in stocks. Spend it all and then kill yourself at 40 when you're life is to far in to make any real concrete change.

China sees itself as a leader in the world economy and is demonstrating it (as opposed to the US, which either uses words or pure force). They’re playing the long game here. Translated to easier to understand situations, it’s like, do you want a manager who’s constantly yelling at you and going behind your back, or a manager who preaches unity.

Appreciated thanks. And in hindsight I guess it should have been obvious. It’s just that when I play with options it shows a break even point higher than the strike price. So I presumed the option would be worthless until that point. And yet in OPs case it’s already well above his cost to buy the options. That’s what’s confusing me.

What was the news?
[removed]
I started trading on 8/28 with $2K. The very next week was the tech sell off, so I'm down 25% that week and I was hovering between 15-20% loss for a month until CRSR IPO'ed, launching me to 3.5K. I stayed stagnant for a couple of weeks until I joined the PLTR rally, taking me to 7k. I took out 2k for Black Friday spending, leaving me with 5k. I joined the GME gang which took me to 6.4K but then earnings brought me back to 5.7K. I then YOLO'd into a penny stock and it brought me to where I am now, 8.3k. I bought the CRSR dip this week, so I hope I continue to climb next week. All in all, I'm up 260.96% and a total profit of 7.4k in 4 months, all in shares. I'm too much of a pussy to touch options.

It has sold off extremely hard in the past week and it is due for a reversal. We have support in the $22 per share range from the last big drop in PLTR so I am not too worried about it dropping much more than it already has if it actually continues to sell off moving into next week.

Yes. Meaningfully more volume driving up IV on those deep OTM options. 

Also, the delta on deep OTM options is pretty low (compared to near the money options). You won’t see much price movement relative to underlying if the underlying drops - mainly because these options are already deep OTM
Why?

Robinhood loans your shares out unless you're on a cash account. That's why you have funds available instantly when you deposit on a regular account. (it's technically margin that RH is loaning you)

you literally cant eat 100% clean and do an endurance sport. its not even about gaining weight. its trying to keep the weight on and have the energy to train. floyd didnt cut much weight. but he trained hard.

its not torture if you love the process and know why youre doing it.

I cannot believe you’re still holding the 1/15 $20c. I thought you would’ve sold those and rolled some out to APR. Confidence to the extreme
Regardless, of how this ends up, thanks for the tips to help me attempt to unfuck myself. That was kind of you and not expected here.
Only about 1% of the retards on here make gains like this. Sadly 99% of them end up giving them back like this. 

Thanks for the loss porn, always makes me feel better.

This video is on the greeks, which are absolutely mandatory to understand to understand why option prices change the way they do. That said you can also just YOLO and hope to get lucky, and it might work out for you once or twice. But then you'll try and buy before earnings and learn the pain of IV crush, or something similar.

Why? Lmao silly boy
Not really through it. I kinda just joined this place to take my mind off it hoping I strike it rich to improve my life. But I'm down almost 40k from pltr over the past two weeks which got me feeling more depressed than ever.
Yeah they sold some of their PLTR position. It spooked investors today and caused the sell off over reaction.
i keep losing money but i just keep buying calls 
loyal to pltr gang 🚀🚀🚀🚀
yea I hope so it's pretty oversold atm I think I'll hold it until mid jan or sth to catch on the pltr train at that time
**Regarding why Palantir is the next Tesla**

Just to give some background, so I studied human bio and CS at Stanford, used to be in the startup game very heavily in Silicon Valley. Met a ton of people, lots of VCs, lots of companies. Had some buddies who worked at Palantir back in 2014ish area. They turned down jobs at google and Facebook for Palantir. At the time I barely knew what they did. Fast forward a couple months, and I visited the headquarters, ate the food, played in the common area etc.

I don’t read what “analysts” have to say, because in my experience, they’ve been wrong more than 50% of the time (at least in trades that I perform). An analyst is about as good at predicting if a stock is a buy or a sell, as a rock is good at predicting if it’s gonna rain or not.

“If the rock is wet, it’s currently raining.”

Yeah no shit. That’s pretty much what analysts do. Regurgitate what the stock is *already* doing. Not predicting what it *will* do.

I digress.

Regardless, those analysts are idiots. You want to listen to what they have to say? Be my guest. Just be sure to use plenty of lube before they fuck you senseless.

I seriously don’t give a flying rats ass what some 2bit, piece of shit, cum stain “analyst” has to say about shit he doesn’t even fucking understand. Oh so the English major out of Tennessee working as an intern at Bloomberg is gonna tell *me* about machine learning and optimized consumer data?

**go fuck yourself**

I could sit around all day and try to explain this shit to you dimwits, but what use would that do? Do you guys know how your smart phones work? Do you know how your service providers and the 5G coverage you get works? Do you know how EVs work? No. No you don’t. And yet you don’t ask me to go explaining them to you before you go investing in Apple, AT&T, Tesla, or QualCom do you?

**once again, go fuck yourself**

Large data sets are the future of pretty much everything. Once you have a large enough data set and a powerful enough computer, you can use machine learning algorithms to find associations within the data. There’s no need to create table sets. There’s no need to assign independent or dependent variables. There’s no need to sift through for confounding variables. There’s no need to assume where the association may lie. It just *does it.*

It takes large data sets and is able to make magic out of them—Palantir offers this ability as a service for companies. They can create specialized CRMs (customer relationship management tools) that allow companies to better track customers. Better sell to them. Better up sell them. Why do you think your fucking Facebook ads work so well? Machine learning dumb ass.

You think Walmart is smart enough to do what Facebook does? Eat my asshole, fuck face. No they don’t. That’s where daddy Palantir comes in. They create custom tools to manage that data and find relationships that Walmart didn’t know exists. Oh shit, 90% of all customers who buy adult diapers also buy vanilla Bacardi rum?! Holy fuck. Liquor revenue up 30% this year thanks to Palantir. You see what I’m saying?

It goes way beyond anything you guys could comprehend. Ferrari? They’re doing optimized data to increase the efficiency of the engine, the traction on the tires, and the aerodynamics of the car. You want to win a race? Put data on your side, bitch.

**You ever seen Money Ball?**

Well just imagine having the autistic fucker from that film, played by Jonah Hill, but on your payroll and as a SaaS.

#That’s Basically Planatir.

TLDR: ***Eat my asshole because you hate money.***
Been in a relationship since 30, but we broke up for like 6 months somewhere in there and I fucked some 20 somethings. Ladies in their 30s are either fucking crazy, gross, or have kids. There are some unicorns, but not many... Haha.
EPR or FB
None of what I said applies to TSLA lol wtf

Not only are you autistic, but you have the IQ of a garden hose too.

Explains why you're shilling a garbage scam stock so vehemently
If the government did their job that cocksucker would be going to jail.
LOL, I'm long on DIS but this is crazy.  At first I thought it said 170
Hopefully your trading skills are better than your rolling skills.
OK, awesome. Thanks. 

 But the ratio is not that high. And I still don't understand why shorts can't cover with calls? Which won't cause a squeeze at all. I'm no expert at this stuff so I'm not being snarky truly don't understand.
I agree that the connection to this sub might be tenuous, but it is useful to atleast be aware of macro factors when putting money to work. Most discussion is 'Gyna bad' or 'Baba moon' which is fun too (and can drive short term prices), but when forming theses it can be worthwhile to understand China's image of itself.

379%, +478k minus some withdrawals here and there. Also sitting on a lot of unrealized gains lol. I was also up a lot higher on Sept 2 and dipped down to 1x on the year by November and basically had to rebuild completely since the election, so not sure it's something to be super proud of. Also I made soo many mistakes especially the past few weeks, by rights I should be lower.

Honestly I think buying and selling everything everything at the beginning of each week killed you. Tesla is up 730% this year.
Please for the love of Musk pay down any debt you have first before making a big purchase like that car.
did you buy before the big dip?
I don’t understand, how are shorts fucked? I mean technically since they’re professional investors they have diamond hands and don’t have issue with paying interests
If they do that, masses will sell causing the stock prize to implode to <10. Makes it only easier for RC to increase his position again with cheap stocks.
It's almost the same market cap as WFC. But 1/5 that of VISA. Feel like this could happen. I might just buy a bunch of shares and baghold if I need to
I agree! At least for the short term.

You should read up on how options work, Out of the money options give the highest returns (at the highest risk obviously).

IV and delta are the biggest factors here.

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/d/delta.asp

https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/iv.asp

It should make sense to you that if you have an option that's 20% OTM, and the stock price goes up enough for the option to be only 10% OTM, the option value is going to increase, since it's now more likely to be worth something at expiration. Obviously at expiration it's worthless if it's even 1% OTM, but if you've got time left then the value is all about the possibility of it ending up ITM.

Just so yknow matey, he is eating shitty, calorie dense foods to gain weight. Maybe even force feeding. Force feeding is no fun, as a strongman or bodybuilder. Or powerlifter.
And cutting weight is hell, ask a bodybuilder, and fighters who have to meet weight limits.
Also, while some athletes are morons, most are pretty smart.. at least average. 
And lastly, the training isn't hell. If you consider it hell you won't keep up and will quit. You do it because you love it. No world class athlete hates their sport

Thanks my guy, you as well 💪
That was my original plan. Oh well
I'm doing alright.  Drinking it away to start the new year
Ok. What are you trying to say though.
Reading and posting on the WSB Daily: net negative or positive?
I feel this homey. I was almost even with PLTR calls and when that citron shit it, it was downhill for the rest of the year
You said it.
Thank you for your service 💎💎💎💎💎
But the only reason he was able to get there is because he takes huge risks and never takes profits.
Ice cream Lieutenant Dan, ice cream!
Im selling leap puts (20 strike) and hoping to buy back later since i figure worse thing that can happen is I get PLTR for 15 which would be a bargain or it rockets and I sell a new higher put. If I get assigned ill sell OTM calls.
Top tier DD right here
Fuck. I’m sorry brother and sending all the positive vibes I can your way. 

Can’t do much as an internet stranger but all I can say is take the all the time you need to grieve. It’ll get less harder with time.
Damn man that’s crazy, how long ago was this? And you’re never too old, especially if you’re a guy. Freeze your sperm tho
I’m done boys. Went 12k to $500 back to 12k (thank you dumb weed stocks). It was a blast, and I learned absolutely nothing.
Very realistic honestly. 150 is the minimum since conservative estimates are around that from analysts who are always under what it ends up being. 300 is best case scenario
If you trade like you roll, you’ll be at $0 in no time.

I hit 245k this month in retirement savings/investments and turned 25 last month.

Find a girl that is like minded and you won't need to live with your parents to accomplish your goals.  We spend 60-70k a year in expenses.
Most potential for losses as well. If you did it with 1k once then you should keep 1k at most and take like 100k or 200k and throw it into a 10x stock. Wayyyy easier money
There are plenty of rocket ships documentaries out there.

While I dont think planet shitness is losing people to the Nautilus and Peloton surge since They're likely different groups, I'd buy puts instead.

GME is stupidly high for being a penny stock. This year should be interesting.
That’s a hard pill to swallow. I hope to see you posting gain porn again in the near future. Hope you’re doing ok and happy new year.

Have you seen the Mouse lately? DisneyPlus is going to match Netflix soon with all those Start Wars spin offs. Just buy leaps on DIS and sleep well.
Happy New Years ya fucking retards.  Especially to that guy who lost everything today after having an ATH of $230K this year.
Its part of their not so secret menu, and if you havent tried their milkshakes, order those too, super thick. Unfortunately they won't go for PSTH because they prefer to expand slowly while ensuring quality.

It depends on your entry price but honestly right now it is continuing to show a bearish pattern and I anticipate it possibly dropping lower and falling under $23 next week if the sell off continues. Most PLTR analysts are super bearish and think the stock will drop to an average of $17 per share. I highly doubt it will drop that low but I can see it dropping under $23 in the short term which would mess things up for you with your option call position.
Didnt Kevin say to never trade on margin in that interview? Not exactly in the wsb spirit is it?
Are you allowed to trade spreads? I would sell weekly  35c’s and make sure I don’t get assigned. You are selling the 35c’s for cheap. Your risk is 40 - 35 - the premium you collected for the 35c **+** the premium you paid for the 40c. If it goes above 35c you get double fucked so there is risk here. But if are smart about it you could make some money while you wait for it to turn around.
That was an easy one that I knew off top of head without doing any digging. I’m pretty sure if you look at some more of the long lived SPACs, they have also traded below $10. I think the point is that they can, and will trade below the IPO price. While I agree that you do have more limited downside, the obvious cost is opportunity cost - otherwise the best trade in the world would just buy a portfolio of SPACs

By allowing SPACs to be talked about, instead you’re just encouraging everyone on this sub to pump post-deal announcement SPACs or rumor-based SPACs trading at 50% or 100% premium to NAV. Which is all fine and great as the music keeps playing. But don’t think for a moment once the music stops, these SPAC meme stocks won’t collapse given so many are pre-revenue
There. Is. No. Way. Out. But. Up.

I've been at this for 10 years and this was the first year I've seen massive gains....until the last two weeks.
Horrible idea.  You’re exposed to all of the moves down but only the small moves up (moves below the strike you sold).  Covered calls seem like a good idea but unless you’re actively managing them (selling on big swings up and buying back on dips) then you won’t beat buy and hold long term.
you have to be drunk as fuck. No way around that

Like AAPL $150, SQ $300, and TSLA $1,000
Lesson learned. You had a good strategy at first now just stick to it. Not just for next year but all the years after that.
$420.69 nice. Good on you man. :)

Anyone else watching 2 Bears One Cave tonight to see Tom Segura’s accident?
I do too. somewhere around 20 would be perfect
You’ve seen a lot of trades with good %’s right? 

Focus on compounding gains. Don’t think about 100% + 

You must have frequently seen 20%-30% on most trades right? 

Get 5 trades in a row 30% each time and reinvest into the next. You can do this without weeklies. Yes it might be slower and more expensive at first but it’s doable

Nah it’s fun it’s a way of looking back at the year and see how far you’ve come.
That’s awesome! Today was definitely an over reaction due to ARK unloading a portion of their PLTR position. We should be in the clear on Monday imo
I've been down for the last half of the year.  I keep trading because I love it and I believe I'll learn how to be profitable
I keep reading about this short squeeze so I bought some options and the required 100 shares of GME but now I read the short interest is only 19 %. That's not considered even high in the stock world. That would take a number more than 30 %.
Woah this guy does the super secret cool thing that literally everyone else totally doesn’t do. Fuck I hate people who smoke weed to be part of a scene

Made a 3 year plan with me, at 25, having 192,000 in investments (15,000 spending per year, which is more than i spend per year now, mainly because i live with my parents). 

or 220,000 with a second job (increased spending per year to 20,000). 

190-220k in savings at 25 is my goal...

MT and VALE should be insulated from some or most of that since they both own iron ore mines and have complete vertical pipelines to make steel. They should be pulling in better margins. The stocks dont move though. Maybe it's all priced in and there are no more buyers?
100MM in shares (like they anmounced in previous earnings) is not enough to really make a difference. If they'd issue more than that, they'd cuck all shareholders and ultimately themselves.
hey fuckface.. fuck u ya fuck

Instead of doing that he bought the 12/31 30c’s and lost it all lol
Yea that’s right. You are capping gains. Except their play is mean reversion. The thought is that volatility for these meme stocks is abnormal (not an incorrect assumption) due to WSB traders bidding up options. You do cap your gains, but you probably get a very healthy premium (ie that capped gains is at a large enough gain that you are okay with it)
Just had in n out first time ever today, I m def going back so I ll try it
That's good, sometimes you have to put self-care first.
Omg fuck me that hurts
I keep telling myself I would cash out if I ever got this far but forgot that the thrill doesn't come from the money it comes from the winning
Oh man I would’ve cut the loss a while ago but I guess you’re so deep now maybe just hope for a pump

Yeah I’ve been buying shares all the way down and I likely just bought some more with the puts I sold. Time to start selling calls while it’s trying to find a bottom
Want a new son?
I mean its pretty much the same thing isn't it?  Plus 20k
This is the way.

To be fair I sold my net and fsly for a loss at 20 also, but didn’t try to short them. My worst short was RCL at 25 and shot up to 70
No. If you cover with stock opposed to cash then it's just the lost potential profit if you get assigned and it goes all tsla.
Retard
3500 shares and $10k in calls. Happy Near Year u/DeepFuckingValue!
PLTR got me feeling down. It wiped out my whole years worth of gains in two weeks.

I was at +34k for the year two weeks ago and now I'm ending 2020 -3k. I feel like my whole year and all the time I put into trading was wasted.
I’d do that for free

I wonder what will be the overall meme of 2021. 

We already had anything EV in 2020.

Only working with about a grand here. Need bigger gains
Your two pages I looked at.

yes. You suck too.
I sincerely hope you are independently wealthy, cuz otherwise you might be the single dumbest person ever.
Hey guys I’m new to this. I was looking at selling covered calls. Can I lose money or is this a foolproof way to get rich? 🤑
Once my momma made cookies and I said to her why are there not enough cookies for everyone in the world and she told me that when the break that eats the wheat yeets it’s sheets it’s time for you to put on cleats eat some beats and get some sleep because when push comes to shove and shove comes to push we must ask ourselves at what time did a alpha bravo become tango mango and once we figure out this question we unluck a part of us that allows to us transcend not only time and space but limitations like a .35 fax at the kitco deli where Pez dispenses not only life lessons but commodity oddities
Better to lose the money in the same year you make it, rather than losing it next month and owing taxes on money you no longer have.
He is the one
I thought my 30k to 198k, down to 7k and then up to 20k was bad.

Don’t have one. Never had one or needed one. 

You can start a resolution at any time bro. Don’t need a new year unless it’s for tax reasons. 
Even then, fuck the IRS. Give them $600 and tell them to fuck off.
Me too brother.
Love you as well lil bish ❤️ 🍻
It HAS to be the unrated extended version. The theatrical version (what was on netflix a while, maybe still is) is garbage compared to the unrated one. Even the dirty Mike and the boys scene is nesrly 100% cut from the theatrical version. Also the soup kitchen scene when they find the red prius after Dirty Mike and the Boys have their way in it.
Cue the fucking 🎻
Can’t believe Emmett Peppers had a couple **TSLA** 900c 1/15.  That boy rich, but he also r fuk

Where is the sarcasm in your comment? Do you understand what sarcasm is? I am indeed autistic so maybes I don’t, but I’m pretty sure your saying that to me and your comment has no sarcasm lol
My resolution is to bang an ig thot on my new yacht after psth completes the merger
I did buy far out and I'm still dying here.  Please MT fly
Yep, feb will be a bloodbath for pltr
He did and lost it all on 12/31 calls lol
My balls haven't dropped yet, am I ?
I've been buying at every support on the way down.

It's like a god damn black Friday sale out here.
I wish you luck dude and next time think differently with your gains :)
Chillin with my girl all weekend what’s your move tn??
TSLA June 2021 450 call. I sold it, I only made 10% instead of making 300%.

So whatever.  

I have shares, but selling the covered call. Was a pussy move.  I admit.  

I still can't justify $TSLA going up over 700% in a year.  It just doesn't make a lot of sense.

Plus the option premiums are ridiculous.
Would kiss Cathie’s Wood for an award at this point

I didn’t realize you weren’t able to squeeze out 100%+ gains this year, sorry for your loss brother. Maybe if you weren’t so retarded you wouldn’t have to play options to keep up with the big bois?

Wait, are you not buying FD's?  You should be up 10,000% right now.  Walk me through everything you did.
What?
You're right but its just the timing of it.  The fall of man.
The best part of today is knowing that even with all the tomfoolery and petty ass play games the short ugly 🌈🐻 pulled we end 2020 with gme substantially higher (5X approx) than the bears thought they would find themselves at the end of the year. Man I can't wait to 5x this bitch next year !
No. Neat trick you can lose above 100% by taking loans from each bank and family member, mortgage the house, heloc etc...and of course maximize margin in your brokerage account

SKLZ had a $20 1/15 csp with 275 premium. Sklz has been stuck in between 18-21 so the theta alone was draining the premium even when it sank to high 18s bc next day with would be at 20 or mid 19s. Yea no shit and the cost average for sklz with that premium is 17.25 which even if I get assigned the stock hasn't hit that low yet even on a red day like today. Retard I can wheel if I get assigned

PLTR 1000c 1/8/21 confirmed
You are correct that options are pretty much a fight between delta and theta. It is generally assumed that Vega is constant with short dated options.

If you read the post, you'll know that my thesis is Vega is going to decrease. If you open up the VIX yearly chart (a somewhat useful representation of volatility), you can see the spike in Feb/March due to the crash and the steady downward slope to the end of the year with spikes during corrections. A lot of uncertainty is being removed in the market. My ASSUMPTION, is that this trend will continue until ultimately reaching a flatter baseline.

Again, this is all an educated guess, but I believe my thesis is sound enough to post it and be able to respond to critique.
If I had more money to put into GME and PLTR... I would definitely give you a platinum award instead
What happened to QS???
Sold at 19.7, bought back in at 19.1. Using these daily fluctuations to buy more shares.

New Year’s resolution is to lose more tendies than 2020!
ARK bought ZM again !!. When are they gonna stop? or do they know something that we don't.
Mara rocket sooon or is the crash upon us?
No bots anymore.
I would never risk it like this, the chance you could've ended up losing it all but also owing 6 figure taxes is terrifying
Why are the reasons for PLTR wrong?
PLTR long term you’ll be ok. GME will bring you up next year, I guess the good part is no taxes, this year? NIO can go either direction (I guess same with PLTR they aren’t profitable). I think you will have a good 2021!
Wsb on NYE?
There will be English translation and I believe part of it will be in English. I usually try to find a local Chinese person on YouTube who presents Nio events live in English. The locals have an edge in coverage vs others from my experience. 
 
My biggest anticipation: a 600 mile battery
I have $300 to use... Should I do 2 AAPL 12+ PLTR?

I'm very glad that you went from $300 to $615 sonny

I probably made more from selling PLTR covered calls than you did on holding their stock, btw. Scalping premiums from meme stocks like PLTR, RKT, SLV that get pumped by the retards here is what I do baby boy 

Funny you call me a boomer when you only hold stocks and don't even do options. Maybe you should fuck off to /r/stocks and GTFO of WSB

You fail to account for the fact that the market will be closed on Jan 8. You probably think just because the closure hasn't been announced yet that means it will be open, but you have to consider what will happen on Jan 6 and 7

Also I applied there and they promptly denied me. So at the bare minimum they can recognize stupid. All in PLTR shares, tired of getting burned on options - 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

How do you know that IV will decrease, and not stay the same or go higher? Also, theta decay is lower the farther you are from expiry. I guess you are correct it’s basically a fight between delta and theta, and can titrate each based on how bullish you are.

According to TA it can reach 21 or so of support level. But you also have the RSI marking that the stock is oversold. I entered already at 23.68. But I'm a degenerate, so your call!

You have to tell people columbia is an ivy lmao.
I also hold shares of PLTR. Honestly, I keep reading how it will perform EOY. I'm considering buying the dip if I can sell my STIC shares at ANY profit (just don't 🤣🤣🤣) so I have enough shares of PLTR to sell covered calls until it starts mooning. At least it'll bring my avg down. Now on the FOMO call, yea....I'll see how that pans out.

To me GameStop could be a perfect setup for drone delivery.  The product is small enough to transported. GameStop locations are numerous and have good coverage area. Large video games have  long download times in certain locations without high bandwidth. It might be conceivable to drone drop a video game faster than than to download one. Then you could send back video games to get credit. Could start with delivery drivers and work up to drone delivery. So many possibilities. Yeah I think a $5B - 13B could be done in a fairly short period of time. Longer term could go much higher.
I love it when the fake gurus on Youtube make a big show out of piling bills on top of a table and then pitch that you can make that kind of money by "working" on your laptop from home.

Hope you had some good gains. Personally only 45% for me, but that’s with a 40k pin risked assignment loss from Tesla snp failure in September, very tragic, wiped out half my account. Otherwise would have been 95% gains.
Most of these expire more than a week out so I'd say 99th percentile for quality of trades in wsb

You're in a perfect spot to compound your way to retirement through an index. Some of it comes down to where you live but 300k is enough to retire on in my state if your home is paid off. It's also hard to plan for whether you're going to pass away at 75 or live to be 96 and forced to live in an assisted living home for a decade. Everyone just has to look at their own parents and make guesses based off that.

This is not correct.  Taxes are aggregated profit & loss for short term and long term.  If you had 10M gain short term from trading during the year and a 10M loss from trading, for that tax year you will owe $0 for those two transactions.  The only time this won’t be true is if the gain is realized in a different year than the loss.  If losses are greater than the gains in a current year, then you are allowed to carry them forward to future years but may only take $3000 per year in the following years.  That’s where the 3000 limitation comes from.

The effort of eradication of rural poverty is admirable, but I don’t think it’s complete at all. There are still millions of poor people dying of hunger and unable to escape poverty, despite the governments best intentions. 

Also missing is the persecution of the doctors who sounded the initial covid alarm. Something more sincere should have included an apology. 

Finally, however, I do appreciate the tone of unity. It’s a nice goal and ideal to pursue and one that’s worthy of pursuit. Even if this is obviously propaganda, at least he’s saying the right words.

Man same shot with me and Nio. Bought at $5 and some change and sold a couple days later at the exact same price. Finally bought back in at $30 before it made its major run to $50 in the following weeks. If I would have held from $5 I would be well into the 6 figures

Yes its gonna pop on loi, but the bigger pop is the final date to receive the tontine warrants. There is going to be a frenzy for shares. The free $23 warrants are attached to the shares at 2/9, but it works both ways, so as share price goes up the warrants value goes up. The warrants are priced in to the shares so it is a feedback loop that causes share price to go up, all in conjuction with a float of holders who want their warrants and arent selling, and buyers clamoring for a piece of the action; both the free warrants and the price action
This aged well

It’s boomers like you that are fucking up our world 😔

I understand that you’re upset that your “blue chip” stocks don’t make money the way we do here, and who knows, maybe that’s why you’re lurking in the comments here? Because you’re tired of your 5% annual gains.

I’ll be honest with you, I don’t trade options, but I was up 105% this year (only 2% gains from Palantir) on stocks alone. Why? Because I’m not an idiot. I invested in solar and lithium long, long before battery day. I rode the run up on piedmont lithium and Rene sola
While your bitch ass was over here trying to make money with American Airlines and carnival cruise.

**I’m sorry if I hit a nerve.**

But I just want to comment saying I didn’t realize you were the original
First commenter accusing me of not knowing what Palantir does. Which I find hilarious.

What I find truly retardedly hilarious, is that ***you*** don’t understand what Palantir does, do you? And you’re butthurt that you don’t understand it. You’re like warren buffet saying to bill gates “I don’t understand computers hurr durr” right before he FOMO’d his ass into Apple after everyone else enjoyed the run up.

**You’re a clown dude. Pure and simple. A fucking clown.**

And I’m excited to see comments and sentiment like this because it proves my thesis. It’s going to take retards like you thinking the stock will plummet in order for it to actually grow. Calls expiring EOY are literally fueling the push down.

Seriously though, señor Boomer, since your ass loves 🌈🐻‘s so much, why don’t you buy some $20 or $25 puts for May?

That aside, best of luck understanding the stock market in 20 years. If you can’t understand what Palantir does now, I’m concerned for your ability to trade based on practical knowledge for the companies do tomorrow.

You already fucked up once by FOMO’ing into this position and then fucked up a second time by not cutting your losses early. You are about to fuck up for a third time by selling at a low. At least let it bounce back a little before selling.

I suppose if one had the equity and truly wanted growth a top rated broker would be the answer , but I started with the free money the goverment was sending and had lived off scraps thinking I could grow that money into something that more resembled what my actual paychecks should have been.  But they took all that growth right the fuck back . If these bets pay off though I'll have at least 500% growth by 4/20

Also these riskier loans have a fee associated with them, so the bank collects huge interest amounts and it also charges the dealer a g or 2 in order to give the dealer the opportunity to make a deal

This sounds harsh but a partner can be dream killers and force you to compromise beneath your true potential.  You are free, now.  2021 is yours, don't waste this opportunity.
Tire wear is a result of friction and friction is function of the normal force and the coefficient of friction. Holding everything else constant, EVs will have significantly more tire wear than their non-ev counterparts due to the additional weight. 

The load rating of a tire has nothing to do with its life span, just how much weight you can safely put on the tires.

Because you don't understand all the Greeks yet. The stock going up is Delta. The time component of it is Theta. The Volatility component is Vega. In the next 3-6 months, Delta may increase the value of the option, but probably not as much as Theta and Vega will drag it down. You profit from the stock going up a little while also profiting from the leap you sold still decreasing in value.

EDIT:  You should probably only do this play on stocks you are LONG TERM bullish on.
Passive investments are up 26%, active 20%, so would have made more money doing nothing.

With that mindset even if you “win” you will always feel like a loser because there will be always someone better than you. No one is going to come and comfort you, regardless of your background past school parents friends etc... you are responsible no one is holding you back. Start by being thankful for what you have.

I don’t see the point of this. If you own a stock you expect it to go up in the long term. But if the stock does go up in the long term, your covered call may be expensive to buy back. It just seems like two opposite ways of thinking. Why even own a stock if you predict it’s gonna trade sideways over the long term?

The average rate paid by risky borrowers who fall into the deep subprime category was 20.93% for a 72-month used car loan taken out in the second quarter of 2020, according to Experian's data. It has risen slightly from the average 20.31% for used cars for the same time a year ago...*

Those predatory rates are lucrative and generally make up for the projected % of defaults. Almost half of borrowers are considered subprime. With covid forbearance it’s hard to know how many people are in trouble since the 30+ days past due % is only slightly elevated over average.

Really hard to know. Dog food and videogames are not really comparable, but I guess you could find some parallels. Video games and pets are pretty personalized (however games cater to more of a community, even single player ones), and less to the individual player since they dont have an emotional connection to the game like they would a pet. GME has a lot of good stuff right now which cohen sees, so I think he would do well. EOY (2021) I think a $5b market cap if they keep making progress pivoting to online/community vs brick and mortar. Cohen's first order of business should be to restructure management though. Check out r/GameStop for a look at some of the bad stuff that happens in the stores (obviously you're not hearing the good stuff on there, its all complaining but seems to be consistent across locations).

You are correct. Selling covered calls lowers your downside risk by getting premium in exchange to capping your gains over that time period. I am pretty sure "hedging" is an alien term to most people on this sub. This strategy is considered pretty much the safest way to do options. Also refer to The Wheel strategy, but that is not the point of this post.

To answer your question of what you are missing, refer to my thesis. In the next 3-6 months, the volatility in the markets will be cooling down, lowering the costs of options generally speaking. The market is pricing the current level of volatility. My assumption is we will continue to see volatility have a downward trend. I could be wrong of course, but this is all my educated guess.

My background is actually economics, and the assumption of efficient markets are thrown out the window once you hit 300 level courses and start dealing with models that factor in incomplete information.
I even hope the bears adhear to this advice

This is some seriously decent advice for this sub. Yeah, selling covered calls isn't going to make anyone rich, but they act as credits to our purchase cost. Worst case scenario, the stock price plummets and we get something small back, second worst case the stock price jumps to the moon and we sell for a profit. That's not bad.
No because this is the second time I've blown up the account.  Took it from 10k to 0 over the summer.

Yeah but we need Steven/Point72 to keep buying PLTR. They’re one of the biggest institutional holders of the stock.
retail brokers like td ameritrade, robinhood etc dont have a way to “find a mm” outside of regular active volume shown to everyone do they? I dont get how you find tge way to do that but i guess it dont matter for me rn since im not in that position hahah. Thanks for the award! This reply can be my last question promise lol

I need to sell back my PLTR 40c 3/19 for pennies on the dollar. Was hoping to do so tomorrow. Now, I guess I'll wait until Monday when the stock falls to a new low...

Anyone have any recommendations on novels about people that would make me feel better about myself? Like I just read a book called “the cartel” about a dea agent in Mexico trying to take down the biggest drug dealer in Mexico, and hearing about the people of Mexico, who live lives controlled by cartels, made me feel better about my loser existence, who recently turned $500 to 20k and proceeded to losing it all.

I'm turning 40 next year and have had a trading account since I was 18.  Traded on and off did normal or boomer things before.  Lost everything during the dot com bust (wasn't much at least) and also shit the bed during the 09 collapse.  21 years in and I guess here's what I still believe.  Diversifying with an index fund is conventional wisdom for regular people.  Most people are pretty dumb in my experience.  Especially with money.  If you think you're better well don't diversify, you could do way better.

Do you even know what tax deduction is? The point of only being able to write off 3k is so that you can't avoid taxes just cause you lost a shit ton of money on the market. It lowered your income. You pay taxes on net capital gains. Try using google

I’d this options or?
If you got in in early December at 13-15 though, and sold near the top, you did ok on gamestop. Trying to catch something already shooting up and being pumped super heavily is just asking for trouble. It went from 16 at open to 20 at close the day before it hit 21..

Pltr has a very promising looking future, I think it’s a decent play if you’re planning on holding shares for at least a few years.
Let me just say fuck you and good job

Ehh this is debatable. This crash was very unique in not only how the government stepped in but why it was caused. Just because the bounce back from this was this quick doesn’t mean it will be this quick ever again. Look at the .com bubble or even 2008 for reference.

The most important options lesson I've learned in the past two months is to take profits. Get and in and out. Don't be greedy. Also don't be tunnel visioned into thinking things like stonks only go up and be able to cut off losses.

Very rare in american pork these days. Med rare all day.
is GME gonna go up or have everyone already given up on that
Very true
Pretty much. This sort of thing works best if you are longing a stock for >1 year. As long as the stock doesn't absolutely tank, in the mid run you get some good premium and in the long run stocks only go up.
Fuckin megachad. Congratulations, and of course, fuck you. Good shit.

Ever since I started 15 years ago, I've probably been like 3-4 days without jerking. Those were mainly because during those 3 days it was impossible for me to do so ( long flights, travel, hectic work pattern etc).

I'm going to go middle ground and say porn is unhealthy, but masturbating is not. I don't agree with NoFap, I think that actually makes you less healthy because there are benefits to masturbation.

Up 123.8% on a smaller account (roughly 3500 invested). Hopefully this bull run continues or I time the dip right!

Could have been more if I hadn’t gone 🌈🐻 a couple times or played VXX. 

GME while still up has been eating my lunch lately (lost roughly $3000 of value). Holding mostly shares. Selling CC on RIOT which is helping. Would be happy with them being called away or at least keep above cost (with CC at least).
I'm not, but it's the only one of these meme EV companies that I've actually seen on the road, so that must mean something

Your fucked if you think that's how it works. It's per transaction. If you have 1 trade that shows a 10 million dollar gain and 1 trade that shows a 10 million dollar loss the next day you still owe taxes on the 10 million dollar gain. Amd you can only use 3000 of the losses per year to deduct.

Generally, it was pretty great for America. There was a pretty big oil crisis/recession in there which a lot of boomers were coming fresh out of college for. Not to mention being drafted to go die in Vietnam and all. I'll take 2008 over that thanks.
I've been watching it all month but not enough time to finish :'(
I mean least you lost it all before end of the year
Happy New Year! Honestly regardless of the fact that you lost it, the fact you were able to make that much is goated. Mad respect!

Hopefully you don't have kids and she has a job.

I’m doing both but at home.  Zoom smoke sessions with family and friends.
good point about retailers. Idk where to find data on the number of naked call options interest, however I doubt it is high (probably less now that the price is moving up). I agree though, there arent enough covered calls possible to get back shares, however hedge funds would be smart to buy as many as possible to minimize the number of shares they have to sell on the open market at squeeze prices. 

I didnt include the share recall because it is uncertain, same with things like RC initiating a hostile takeover. Obviously those would be dramatic catalysts but it is dumb to bank on something like that when investing.
Those are standard orders with "On the close" instructions aggregated together. A large buy/sell block occurs everyday for most equities. This is nothing special.
How the fuck does that work on your knees? I don’t wanna do the work
Yes, I get it, but from my short experience I can say nothing is granted... and instead of having 20 stocks, probably go for an index fund (but from your experience you already know this).

Just curious to know your thinking.
There isn't active volume, but you can always pay the MM a premium.

E.g. let's assume the price is $20 and the strike is $10. There's $10 intrinsic value. You would find a MM willing to take that off your hands at say, $9.95 or $9.90 because that's free alpha for them, enabled by their balance sheet.

Trading platforms that aren't shit and let's you view '$ up or down, % up or down ' like Robinhood when you view 5d, 1m, 3 and so on on a chart?

Why are most platforms stuck in a boomer shit phase? Yahoo finance, tda, TOS none of them let's me view this
I'm with you. I'd much rather bring in the new year sipping beer and smoking a spliff than going out drinking
Anal?
even if RC doesnt move in, as long as he is keeping pressure on the board (which is extremely likely) then GME will see bullish progress. Even without a squeeze, the shorts covering will cause the price to increase
ETF ipo is also holding pltr
going out sucks but weed also sucks
Lmao imagine giving your wife any kind of control over finances
I forgot this was happening. Way to ruin my year bud
Are we addicts?
Only on WSB can a post get that many awards for no damn reason
That is the way and you don’t wake up with a hangover so it’s easier to make trades in the morning
lol that joke was the bomb
Anything closed for tax purposes had to be closed today, no?
it’ll probably be red but not for that reason
Ah fuck, I'm still down here in the lower class drinking coors light.
This time last year I was gearing up to head to my buddies ranch about an hour outside of town to blow shit up and grill out. 

I get a random text from this chick that I met right before Thanksgiving at some charity event at a cigar bar. 
I never followed up with her because I had other shit going on. 

She was like “What you up to tonight? I’m at the airport.”

*Don’t ask me to pick you up 😎. I’m headed to my buddies ranch to blow up some fireworks and probably milk a pig.*

“I’m flying back into town tonight. Got a date?”

*Nope. No date. Come by if you want. It’s far though. Like farm roads far.* 

“Send me the address.”

Keep in mind; I know nothing about this girl. Other than being young(26ish) & cute.  
I was in the process of moving and we only texted a few times, but I always appreciate a woman that takes initiative.
Even if they turn out crazy later. 

Hours go by and I’m like there is no way she’s coming out this far. 

Sure as shit this minivan pulls up and it’s her Uber. 

She hops out with a bottle of Jameson and is in full fledge party mode. 
I’m thinking that’s like a $100+ Uber ride out here. Cool. 

Another thing to note is I’m completely sober. 
I learned early on that booze & explosives don’t mix. 
Plus I’m old and spent enough nights toasted and I wanted to wake up in my own bed. 
Not jail. 

Night goes on and it’s just good company. 
Then it’s like 4am, bonfire is burning out, bluetooth speakers are dead, and I’m ready to go. 

“Will you give me a ride home? I’ll pay you.”

*Yeah. Sure. Of course. Don’t worry about it.* 

We get in the 4Funner and she immediately passes out. 

We get to her part of town and I wake her up because I don’t know her address. 

“Wanna come up? I got pizza rolls.”

Where the fuck has this woman been my whole life? 
Oh yeah. Not born. 

So, I come up mainly because I need to piss. 

I get out of the bathroom and I thought she fell, but she was actually trying to breakdance. 
[Naked](https://twitter.com/pepeforthewin/status/1344800339732606977?s=21). 

I take a [pic](https://twitter.com/pepeforthewin/status/1344800339732606977?s=21), but I’m laughing my ass off at how ridiculous this all is. I mean this girl is 100% high society. 

I’m sober right. So, I’m like what the fuck is really going on?

“You can take the couch if you want.” 

*Perfect. I’m fucking egg-sauce-Ted.*

Woke up to the sound of a shower like 6 hours later and then she had me come to bed with her. 

“I have bruises. Was I breakdancing last night?”

*Ha. Yes. If that’s what you wanna call it.*

“I don’t know why I do that.”

I never got those pizza rolls, but that was my New Years last year. 


RIP MF DOOM

They would close on Monday so they don't have to pay taxes for 2020
That’s because the west only reports the camps, not the context. When people only read one sided reports, they don’t get the full picture.

Xinjiang suffered from terrorist attacks and ccp went through a lot of trouble to clean the mess up. The camps were created to prevent terrorism. And as usual, ccp’s response is harsh.

There’s a lot of fake news and misinformation in the west to demonize China, but bashing China is popular in the west anyway.

i will just leave this here. If you want to know more, it would be better if you look into it yourself.

Karp big interview with the Washington Post on covid tracing next week and live demo on Jan 27. Where have you been?
You da man
It is the last day before the new year, so I doubt it. If there were to be an exchange, it would be private trades over the counter or on an ECN and would probably not even be reflected in the actual market (think transferring shares from one brokerage to another, the shares arent sold by one broker and bought by the other, they are just transferred). 

If GME and CRSR were being exchanged you probably wouldnt know it was happening.
She’s just a bear(d)

You got banned because r/GameStop is just for employees to bitch and moan. Seeing you care about the company pisses them off because you’re working harder than they are. They also seem to despise investors because we see potential in a company they don’t see a future with.
I mean I was noticing small amount 1-20 missing here and there.  Not really worth my time.  Ill just switch brokers fuck em.  The bigger issue is that they don't look out for your best interests at all.  I'd rather pay for trades than be thrown under the bus all the time.

The ones presented by Republican lawyers on the multitude of cases in various states?  

Funny how when there are actual consequences for lying, they explicitly say they are not making claims of fraud, lol.  Lawyers can get disbarred or be otherwised punished by judges for lying and wasting time.  These are Republican judges in many cases as well, including Alito, who chimed as Trump claimed "he'd send it to the supreme court", even though they don't have jurisdiction.  

How about listening to one "lefty" news source for every one that just tell you what you want to hear?  Media is biased and the truth is usually somewhere in between.

Just because you sell out of a product does not mean your business is going to be successful. If there is low supply of used games, chances are they will sell out. And even the new games, still too many options to purchase elsewhere. Brick and mortar retail is not a huge moneymaker like it was 20 years ago. The only way it will be successful is if they create an experience you can’t get anywhere else. I don’t see that happening anytime soon given our Covid situation. It’s a tough retail sector to be in to make $$.
Let's say you stick it in VTI, SPY, or better yet, QQQ. Lets also say you only gain 10% per year until you're 65 and never put another dime in your account. You'll retire with $2,884,198.

Not sure what you are talking about, most my shit was down today, been bleeding last 5 days. Monday will be an up day as funds that were rebalancing etc start to buy back into the market. They have created an easy upside for themselves in Jan to get 3 to 5% first 2 weeks 2021 in stocks like AMD, OSTK, GME, DPQ, FSLY, PLTR, Baba, CRM, Splunk etc. If I would have thought about it I would have shorted them all the last week and bought in on Monday.

No reason some of these should be down except some profit taking etc for taxes year end. It will be all in on Monday. 

I just received my Stim today!
Lol this really shows how much retail investment has increased this year, big tech companies 10x- 20x more traded than the previous year that’s crazy

America killed most muslims than Uighurs entire population, I heard their lifestyle, income is getting better every year.

China goes through bloody civil war in all of its generations. More people were killed by nationalist party to keep communist at bay. By your logic does the current republic in USA after civil war = Bad . Since many people dies in us civil war ?

It’s China bro. If they can arrest anyone and disappear them for being Muslim, they can crack down on people selling shit that causes plagues.

Just caught a month ban on r/Investing. Guess they’re just jealous of our awards
Saw the big crash in March and decided to get started in the stock market. Bought a bunch of dips and I’m sitting at 84% rn. No options, just riding the wave of recovery
I mean its a good idea to double check everything for taxes just so there's no surprises later.  But yeah with robbinghood id definitely recommend it
Its so boring with the market closed. If this was a true capetalishm, markets would be open.

You obviously don’t get laid very much. Wank sock at the ready?
True.
I sold mine. Rather just have BETZ ETF
Holy shit man.  For real.

What's really telling is that my paper trading account, which I just set up in August (I just wanted to feel out etrade before moving over) with a bunch of plays and forgot about, is up 180%.

NIO leaps, NET leaps, CHWY leaps...  each of which I held in real life but in FD form and lost money on.

Wait what the fuck man.

Fucking nuts how I get news now. 

Gotta tell the homies... thanks and cheers.
Shoot for roughly 32 delta and roughly 45 dte. Outside of 1sd the premium really drops off and the fastest theta decay is 45 -> 10 dte. If you start to get tested or you hit 7 dte or so, then roll out to the next exp at 32 delta.

You can do this indefinitely unless there's a sudden gap up, at which point you have to decide wether to buy your way back in to additional gains or take your profit as it stands.

As things are priced right now, I'd sell the 2/19 $30s for $1.63. Pretty safe, liquid, and reduces your basis to $25.87.

Worst case scenario is an extreme gap up to $35+ and you can't roll for a credit. In which case you would collect $1.63 premium + $2.50 price movement for a total return of 15% on a stock you were expecting a loss on.
All covid related shit is priced in. It’s boom time baby

What do you mean? If i has these and went on my portfolio to sell to close there is like not any volume anymore on some of these...the order to sell would just stay open since there would jot be enough interest out there to get rid of all these contracts...i must be missing something. 🤷🏻‍♂️

Ah, you just buy the same call back so no one can take your sweet meme stocks. Wouldn't you want to sell your stocks while they're hyped? Or is the whole play just the calls as long as the stock loss is < call gain?
These retarded GME and PLTR bag holders just love giving their money away. Please continue to throw your money into the fire pit and provide us with more loss porn.
I think you must just be coming on at the right times, cause I feel like all I ever see here is tsla.

Oh shit, I had no idea. That really sucks :(
It's part of the top secret data
Lol this guy is fucked
I felt you shouldn't start on Oct 22. They just started enrolling back then. They completed the enrollment on Nov 30th. And they might publish the result after 110 cases and perhaps past that to their favor if it does the same thing as Moderna, which released after 196 cases (Moderna has twice as many participants enrolled)

&#x200B;

For Moderna:

completed their enrollment on Oct 22. ([link](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-completes-enrollment-phase-3-cove-study-mrna-vaccine))  They planned to do "Formal study efficacy analysis will be triggered at 151 cases, with two earlier, interim analyses after 53 and 106 cases"

Moderna reported results on Nov 30th with 196 cases. ([link](https://investors.modernatx.com/news-releases/news-release-details/moderna-announces-primary-efficacy-analysis-phase-3-cove-study))

US added 4.5 million cases (infection rate: 1.34%)

Moderna had 30,000 participants so 1.34% \* 30,000 \* 0.5 / 95% efficacy \* 90% drop out = 190 cases. They reported 196 cases. So this estimate I guess is not far off.

&#x200B;

Now, if the same assumption holds up for Novavax, then (though many confounding factors might exist such as a higher dropout rate as vaccines are now available in UK)

Novavax had 15,000 participants. From Nov 30th to today (Dec 30th), UK added roughly 0.8 million cases (infection rate: 1.2%)

With 90% dropout: 1.2% \* 15,000 \* 0.5 / 95% efficicacy \* 90% retention = 85 cases

With 80% dropout: 1.2% \* 15,000 \* 0.5 / 95% efficicacy \* 80% retention

= 75 cases

Novavax mentioned in that announcement that they plan to do interim analysis after 66 and 110 cases ([announcement](https://ir.novavax.com/news-releases/news-release-details/novavax-provides-phase-3-covid-19-vaccine-clinical-development)) If Novavax does the same thing as Moderna - reported after cases exceeded the second milestone (110 cases), then I see it is likely they will publish 1-3 weeks later

I guess it all comes down to when they decide to make an announcement and whether the drop out rate is higher
Ok cool ill check it out, thanks
I’m very good at doing my own taxes and have a full time job to write off against.  Not my first time playing this game. 2021 will have more buys and sells anyway.
Maybe if you're lucky enough to get another home run you won't continuously yolo it into $0. You don't have to put $50k or $100k into savings when you get a lucky yolo, you can continue to trade. The key is to trade smart next time and stop putting all of your buying power into weekly calls for the same stock.

exactly, join the gme train to tendies land
It’s rough with pltr being so beaten down now. There’s not a lot of premium for contracts above you’re break even.

Right now you could sell a weekly with a strike of 31 and make 9 bucks per contract. Not great but do this every week to help offset some of the damage for now.

If you sold weekly calls for say 25 strike you would get 65 per contract and if they executed you just sold your shares for a 600 dollar loss minus your 65 premium for writing the call.

It’s a tough spot that we’re in together fellow bag holder.

He's so stupid because he picked two tickets he doesn't know how to do so it's clear what he's doing to management. You can fool some of the people some of the time. You can't fool all the people all the time.
Guys I just had an idea!!! what if we all shorted like 10 shares of GME until there's literally no more shares for melvin to short to manipulate the price.. then when the short squeeze happens we can just cover our shorts with our own shares so its like breaking even on 10 shares but melvin will have to buy our shares from us for a high price since they dont have any

Now i'm not so sure. People here seem split. Some think a Dem win is bearish but others think it is EXTREMELY bullish. 

These media retards find it bearish:

The Mach E doesn’t even beat the Model Ys range while using an 88 kWh pack versus the Y with a 75 pack. Ford is cramming in a larger battery but can’t optimize for shit when it comes to matching Tesla’s efficiency. So yea, it definitely seems like Ford is going “heavy in EVs with better specs” cause they’re making cars with higher costs and less range and efficiency. Oh and while Ford is taking the L with basically 0% on margin on these things to keep the prices low and attract customers, their dealers are marking the sales price up 10-25%.

Oh I thought the price of a stock was something every one had the same number of.  So different brokers all would have a different price of a stock at the exact same moment and potentially I could get a stock for cheaper depending which broker I wanted to use at that moment , and could collect better returns from different brokers because the point i sell would also have a different number depending on the same factors ?

They’re not buying as much assets as they were earlier in the year. Some of their asset-buying programs expire today. Basically, fhe money printer is being taken away. Since QE usually results in stocks going up, it’s not the best news to you and I. However, there’ll be a new Treasury Secretary soon, so those programs will probably come back.

True.

> Why can't he deduct the full amt on his taxes though right away?

imagine you're really wealthy with lots of money in different stocks. Inevitably some of these stocks will have huge losses. If you could deduct unlimited losses from your tax burden, you'd just sell your biggest loser on Dec 31st every year and mostly avoid paying income tax. The 3k limit prevents that from happening, but still lets normal people take advantage of deducting losses. Basically unlimited deductions would let you defer, not avoid, your  taxes for a long time, and the government tries hard to not let people do that

Remember, YOLOing your life savings on weekly options is a relatively recent phenomenon that the average person couldn't do when these laws were written.


&nbsp;


>What happens if if instead of a 20,000 gain he only realized 10,000?

Assuming you have 11k of capital losses that you're carrying over for that year, you'd be able to offset the entire 10k capital gain, and also use the remaining 1k to deduct against your other income tax for the same year

Honestly just always buy spreads (debit) and you’ll instantly improve your options game.  The best case scenario is it moves against the long leg, you close the short, and then it goes your way on a free long option.  I took an account that was down to $150 all the way to $1k with that strat.

That or sell calls at strike prices above your leap prices
Elephant on dick
Same situation with apple and styluses?
Let’s say you invest $10K and miraculously turn it into $100K. If you sell and close your position, you will realize a $90K gain on which you owe taxes. If you held that position for less than a year, that is all taxed as regular income. To make it easy, we will assume a 33% rate. So you owe $30K in taxes on your $90K gain.

Now, let’s say you put that money into weekly GME calls expiring next Friday. Since it is a weekly and you’re on WSB, we can assume you will hold it until it expires completely worthless. Now you have $0, except that when this position expires, it is 2021, a new taxable year from when you made your $90K (an event which triggered a $30K tax liability), and you cannot use the loss to offset your previous gain. So now you have $0 and no money to pay your $30K tax bill.

why diversify if you know what is gonna work?  I'm half serious .... I'll probably go to 3-4 things in the future, as its just too much money in one trade now that its quadrupled in the last few years.   Still its a lot easier to research and watch a few names than say 20.

Praying for a slight pullback. Sold $47 covered calls this week and had to roll to $60 1/29’s to keep shares. Don’t want to lose them. Still not too confident that I won’t lose them at $60 before end of Jan.

Did he dodge it though? The calls are for 12/31/20. It's showing a loss on his portfolio due to the drop in premium. The actual loss won't be realized until the next day 1/1/21. So as far as the IRS is concerned he is up 100 K in 2020. Assuming he lets them expire on their own.
Did everyone realize at once that QS is years away from actual revenues?

agree but i think, assuming company matches 401k, that has to be the #1 priority because you don't want to lose free money. Then I think Roth is second option to max because you can always take out the contributions or remove money for emergencies while getting the tax shelter. HSA has been my last priority bc there is only very specific things related to health that you are allowed to spend money from the hsa on so it can kind of get trapped in there.

Is this how you see it?
ROBO
He sold?
Good play!
Started the year with 4k. Deciced to do WSB, yolo’d the SPCE leaps because I saw the rocket emoji, sold near the top around 40ish and 4-5x’d. A week or so later YOLO’d spy otm weekly puts when covid was spreading hit 58k and RH went down during a dead cat bounce and i went from 58k to 20k. Decided to roll my puts out a few weeks and got back to 50k and cash’d out 20k. 30k in account.

Got fooled by Separate Variation and TSLA puts got me back down to like 4k. Decided I got lucky on options and did NIO shares, then PLTR shares, then GME. Around 15k started doing options again was at 40k now at 30k. Overall 4k to 50k this year.

The $23 is just to open the position. If BABA stock sinks or even consolidates, you have probably no more than a couple hundred dollars at risk.

It’s bc of the award post
Do you sell put credit spreads?
As someone who paper handed NIO at 12$ Don't sell
Everybody already bought in at lower prices remember? They booked orders while it was rising.
Holding because I’m a long term thinker and it pays off more than trying to swing it cuz capital gains tax homie

Is the SE like same as iPhone 7 and 8?

[-58% for the year](https://i.imgur.com/4hpcUgL.jpg)🤡

I use RH for options only.

Started doing options trading for the first time this year and started out as a 🌈🐻. That lead to my first descent to -36%. Then realize that was not the way and got CCL calls and went +25%.

Got greedy and held my calls for too long and lost all the gains. Then I got into MSFT calls and was on my way back up. But then I held too long again like a retard and went to -93%. Only had like 2.5k left at that time and was thinking of giving up on options.

Did a YOLO on TSLA call which gave me some breathing room. Been playing SPACs and mothlies/leaps for the most part now.

My MSFT shares on the other hand are doing pretty good. Up 80k on those so the year wasnt all bad

Because at the casino if you are good at winning  they break your legs and kick you out. In stock big wins for us are negligible to the whole operation imo.
Yeah, but if they are actively managing it to satisfy a target (e.g., no more than x% in Tesla) it's equivalent.

140 1/15 $10 calls @ 1.13. Bought in a week ago @ $10.70. Up 28K. I think it’s about to really moon for the next 2 weeks. 

I never YOLO but I saw *G-H-I-V* and *I-P-O-C* under $11 and I knew both were about to moon off upcoming mergers in January. 

In case you don’t know about SPACs, they have a price floor of $10. So going all in under $11 only carried maybe a 20% max loss risk.

This is just them actively managing the holdings of the funds lol

Guys I just had an idea!!! what if we all shorted like 10 shares of GME until there's literally no more shares for melvin to short to manipulate the price.. then when the short squeeze happens we can just cover our shorts with our own shares so its like breaking even on 10 shares but melvin will have to buy our shares from us for a high price since they dont have any

Are you asking why the option price went up? 

The stock price went up, so delta made the option price go up.

You can sell the option any time, you don't just make money by excersizing. Basically no one here actually excersizes their options.

The argument could be made in 3 weeks time will be having that annual discussion about legalizing federally. Likely you'll see a couple of senators and house reps getting behind it. It could be the right time to buy in to weed stocks as a whole with anticipation of selling sometime in late January.

Alright lads let’s repeat it.
Just redownloaded, apparently I had it before. What are your current plays
Cathie looking to buy out TDOC... No more shares for anyone else
I think RKT is a terrific long but wouldn’t play any options.
went from 3k to 2k. after not seeing any green for like 10 months now, I finished the year with a final run from down 30% to up 7. Last day kinda fucked me so instead of 250 up im leaving this year with 116 up and a wealth of knowledge, at least thats what I like to say, last thing i did was throw 12% into a stock I red a single reddit post on, that just had rocket emojies and was up 5000% this year.
I think if we all pool our money we can afford a quant made by my local girls who code club.
Yes
They have to when it keeps going up
Or it could mean $Baba puts?
From 10 shares to 20 shares. Or they’re saying goodbye, context matters

Good one

Cathie sold TSLA today

And bought Zoom, TDOC, and other pharma stocks
no market tomorrow? thats gay
I wish I had a fuckin clue what you guys are talkin about I just keep investing 5 dollars in tesla and waiting to get rich
Im holding both as well. Will likely go down bag holding these since both of my positions are after earnings
How you liking this ride? I’m loving if
will PLTR ever go above 25 again? asking for a friend.
Those swings on L M N D are only going one way in the near future.
EOY yes.Because TSLA will hit 4206.90 post 10-split by August, and Elon will be literally on Mars with alien hookers and space weed; so under the NEW less autistic management and non-sporadically retarded tweets, TSLAs new management would stabilise the stock under $265.
Freaking cash out and buy the most boring dividend paying stocks ever....Then sell simple covered calls against them and buy a Ferrari every month!

Just checked i haven't gotten it yet
I bought calls two days ago and recouped a tiny amount during the bull run yesterday, then sold them.
Should I buy weekly ARKG puts as a hedge against my ARKG calls and shares YOLO? When it goes down right now I'm in so much pain. But maybe I can hedge that with weekly puts? My calls are for Feb ATM, July OTM and DecemberOTM.
quiet day over at ARK today, not much action.

#LMFAOOOOOOOOOO
You thought?
This was my first full year of trading - I'm viewing it as my Freshman year of trading.

Made a ton of mistakes.

Discovered Options in September 2019.

Made $800 on ATVI monthlies and was hooked.

Overconfidence from beginners luck resulted in me being down $5k by March.

I made $4k back during the March sell off on travel sector puts.

My biggest mistakes were in April. 

I went nearly all-in Amarin (shares!) the day the results of a large lawsuit were announced. After Hours that day Amarin tanked 70% and my account plunged to -$8k.

Tilted and shocked I went on to make a serious of absolutely retarded options plays with earnings FDs.

By mid-May my account reached its all time low of -$14k.

Being the autist I am, I decided to liquidate my Roth IRA and transfer the funds into my Robinhood. It was mental relief seeing my RH go from -90% to only -45%.

JPOW on my side, I proceeded to have an epic winning streak from late May into September.

I went from -$14k to +$3k in 4 months.

Ended up giving back some of this gains and closing my Robinhood account at +$600.

I decided to turn a new leaf and switch to a slightly better noobie platform and transferred to Webull.

Taking advantage of a promotion to get 25 free stonks for depositing $25k or more, I deposited ~$26k in October.

Big mistake.

October was the second worst month for me. Without PDT restriction I day traded ODE options and over leveraged myself on more than one occasion.

I went from +$600 to -$8k by Halloween.

I changed my strategy significantly and had another massive winning streak where I simply could not lose money. I don't think I had a single red day in November. My biggest win was +$9k on ICLN and CGC when Biden won the election.

By early December my account reached its all time high of +$10k.

The rest of December has been unkind to me and I'm currently sitting at +5k.

Going into 2021 my goal is to spend less time trading and to average $100-200/day and end the year up $26-52k.

I'm currently nearly all-in P C P L and T H B R, both of which are SPACs reasonably near their NAV with a lot of upside potential and not much downside in the interim.

My plan is to hold these puppies for several months and use a much smaller amount to trade options.

My next options trade will be a play on the Georgia runoff election on the 5th.

If Democrats win both seats I'm going to buy ~$10k in weed FDs as soon as the results are announced. If Republicans win at least one seat I'm going to patiently wait for an entry on ICLN (I think it will sell off and trade at a discount), then load up on leaps before Biden re-joins the Paris Climate agreement.

Looking forward to my Sophomore year of trading!
Shit stonk? You bought high and sold low for sure ;)
So let me get this straight. In your world, a stock that already went up over 100% since IPO earlier this year is somehow going down because it stopped mooning for 1 week. So I guess the in depth DDs discussing how solid this company is doesn't matter if you don't see massive gains everyday till the end of time. 

I don't think the problem is the stock, I think the problem is your weak hands. I think you need to reassess your risk tolerance and stay in the short bus if you're not man enough
I’m in.
You sir, have my greatest respect.
Do you have a source on that TSLA claim?

Besides TSLA I’d say this is quite possible
Whipped cream is Keto?
This is the kind of DD I unironically follow this sub for. Fullproof
I think one of the problems we have with r/investing is all the cringe that comes from the posts.   Let me know how that $300 dividend portfolio is working out and your plans to invest your dividend returns over 20 years.  or the "HELP Tesla has dropped 5% should I sell?" Its training wheels for beginners, I get it but its fucking painful to spend even a few minutes on that sub.  Also why is with there motto "Lose Money With Friends" how the fuck is that investment advice?  Here let me help you with your investing plan 1. Buy Bluechip Tech 2. Buy the Dip. 3. Don't Sell, 4. I told you don't fucking sell 5. Don't fucking sell, keep buying you paperhanded fuck they are shares for god sake average down.

If oneplus ever goes public i'm definitley all in. Their smartphones are so underrated and the smartwatch is looking very promising as well. They are in my opinion very underrated and the upsides are huge
Yeah. SPG can have some nice swings for day trading. I poured most of my portfolio into buying shares over the summer when it was in the 60’s. Even though it’s in a declining industry, it’s a solid company with good fundamentals and a big dividend. I was hoping it would be higher by now but I still plan on riding it out to >$100. 

I would check out LMND for day trading too. It’s been having crazy 10-20% daily swings the past few weeks.

What were you at before??
Disowned and broke
All the ARK ETFs are down this past week. Cathie also has been buying lots of big cap cos this past month. Maybe the strategy is to hit pause until the new year, and save some of those gains for 2021 instead of 2020 since she already had a record year.
This is what usually happens when people post gains like that lol.

If anyone needs me I will probably be passed out drunk or on a crack binge or doing degen things behind a back alley dumpster or maybe all of the above.
had 4k beginning of the year, found wsb in feb and 13x my account to 58k. cashed out 20k, been -50% and -75% a few times but the gme pltr nio memes brought my back to 30k as of the market close today 😀

Not for me, I was red for the year
It’s seems to be consolidating right now at around 4-4.10 maybe wait till Monday to see how it goes. I told my buddies on Tuesday to jump in when it was at 1.40. I told him to wait cause there might be a correction. Next thing I know it shot up to 1.70 AH. Just put what you’re comfortable with, and build an entry/exit Plan you feel safe with. Doing a DD on the company will help the most. Because it’ll give you conviction behind your investment.
PLTR going up 200% is insane and unsustainable but TSLA going up 700% is completely normal and earns it S&P inclusion.

Also these dudes make the kind of money that gets managed professionally. He could never just “spend it all” cause his life is a branded machine. He can’t lose. Him being broke would put tons of folks at risk of losing their jobs so his brand is managed as are his finances.

I wouldn’t be surprised even at his level if there’s clauses in his contracts that so much of his money has to be handed over to professional investors so he doesn’t blow it all. Sports unions probably got better at making this a reality cause of all the young athletes are days past who didn’t manage their money

ICLN is going to shred into the new year , cheers to all and goodluck.
The march 20s are so deep in the money that they have almost no theta.
The 25s are like 5 or 6$, in that situation, shares are better.
My rationale was really to free up capital while I wait.
If shares drop in price by march, the spread between the 20$ calls and the share price will start to widen, making the calls a bit more defensive. If the stock runs up, I get all the upside and can always exercise.
25$ calls need to work through said theta, might be a bit cheaper, but less defensive imo.
YOLO on OTM short term options plays AKA FDs
Good lort I went to buy a ternion for fun and did not realize it’s 50k coins....paper hands over here does not have that coinage sorry
I see what you're saying now, it'll only take 1 billion extra profit to bring that P/E ratio down to Amazon's level. Either way it's a waste of time to talk about the P/E ratio for a company like TSLA since they are barely profitable and it makes P/E ratios a useless metric to evaluate TSLA and most growth companies.

Okay, from a lurker that has never traded and likely never will - I have to ask... You have $2K and turn it into $100K. Why on earth at that point wouldn't you take out say $10K and put it in a pot somewhere? Then, no matter what happens, you still made $8K. Why keep risking the whole lot? Heck, why not keep 50% of your profits and gamble away the other 50%?

Sure they MIGHT have revolutionary solid state battery tech but they wont be the only ones and they are very unlikely to dominate the future battery market.

They are also literally 5 years from ANY revenue; pretty difficult to sustain a bubbled valuation (in the middle of an EV bubble, in the middle of a general market bubble) for that long.

It was a SPAC that went 13x from 10 to 130. infinite price/sales

No chance this thing stayed that high and the options prices reflected that

Yes, but lock up periods are specifically after IPOs.
Ended the year around 4k down. Fuck me man. Weird, after losing my first stimi check, I thought I knew the game. Guess I was wrong.
este es el camino
It was not that bad. Covid was a great excuse to get out of just about anything.

I’m too sacred to hop on the train.
This is literally me, a broke retardo who got 180 dollars off my first 400 call on pltr then lost 100 on MT so now I just use my measly 300 buying power and invest in basic gme stocks. We will get to space, just takes time
epic loss porn. hope the success of this post eases some of that pain you must be feeling right now. good luck next year!
🎉🎉🎉 time to get older

Solid Thesis. I’m bullish now more than ever. I’m setting a high sell price for a squeeze and if it doesn’t hit, as long as RC moves in by summer, I’ll ride this train for a couple years instead. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

2020 set the stage, 2021 we get the performance

Started with 10k. Up 450%. But I was down 80% a month ago lol. This could also change drastically in the next 2 weeks as I’m still all in.

Jesus man. I would have taken profits and start over at 10k again.

Introverts should stop lying they hated 2020, when they actually loved it more than any other year in their life
Bro, I know...
This was the way.
Opposite. If Republicans win, no stimmy = pandemic economy = AMZN and APPL and GOOG eat the world.

Dems win = more stimmy for the liddle guys. And maybe even some anti-trust action against the uber giganto companies that own us.

>For example, Frank realized a capital gain of $10,000 in 2013. He also realized a loss of $30,000. He will be able to net $10,000 of his loss against his gain, but can only deduct an additional $3,000 of loss against his other income for that year. He can deduct the remaining $17,000 of loss in $3,000 increments every year from then on until the entire amount has been deducted. However, if he realizes a capital gain in a future year before he has exhausted this amount, then he can deduct the remaining loss against the gain. So if he deducts $3,000 of loss for the next two years and then realizes a $20,000 gain, he can deduct the remaining $11,000 of loss against that gain, leaving a taxable gain of only $9,000.

go with leaps on BA. Airlines are notoriously bad investment vehicles. You’re betting on picking a surviving airline among a few. Just pick the only commercial plane manufacturer
Thanks for all that. Where do you hear about high-growth startups? Wait for an analyst yo mention them in one of the big financial news outlets? Get in a good Discord?

I've been pretty high on raw materials. CLF has been a super consistent weekly play the last 2 months. I stopped losing money when I stopped FOMOing into meme stocks and actually looking at charts/news and making honest projections.

Investment, trading, long or short are all fine. Making money through manipulation is not fine.

Generally large investors don't need to manipulate anything. They want to buy shares at low prices. So if someone wants to drive it lower, that's great. Then the investors sit or help the business succeed in long term. 

Shorting is a different game. They need all kinds of scare tactics, fake news, bad mousing the company, trading manipulation, insider news, naked shorts... they need to drive it lower, force margin calls, or force the company to bankrupt.

Basically investors want the business to succeed, shorts want it to fail. Sometimes they do things to cause it to fail.

Are there legitimate shorts who take a short position then calmly sit and watch? I'm sure there are.
Okay you insulted me. Go fuck yourself you pretentious dumb fucking piece of shit. I clearly said that once they realized their deferred revenue of which they will have 1.1 billion next year alone they will have a similar P/E ratio to that of Amazon. This is facts and came from the daily Tesla YouTube videos I watch. Seriously, you’re a dumb fuck. I’m trying to talk to you and you act like an asshole. Keep buying puts. I’ll see you in a year. How about we see who was wrong then
Is this you Cathie???
Recover from a hangover.
Get into SPACs while they are low. Predictable af and little to no risk under $12. They have a price floor of $10 so you know your max loss before you buy.

WSB was bar far the best thing about 2020. 

I enjoyed making/losing tendies with you guys. 

Please stay healthy and don’t get Covid. You can’t make tendies if you’re dead. ☠️
damn it the 🥭 predictor is never wrong

I signed up for extended hours trading so I could snatch up those >$19 shares of GME

Sorry for making the price tank at the next open
What’s the reason? Why so soon?
Pretty much. And 2018 was dark times for GME. Yet, that is all the business is currently valued at mid turnaround and Cohen involvement. Joke valuation by the market due to ongoing price rerating and constant short manipulation.
No one here has diamond hands enough to get the cap gains treatment after 12 mos
All I know is buy low sell high... ur telling me there’s a reading aspect?
Yeah I’m holding over night. I’ll be up PM Monday watching like a hawk tho.
that's because they are closing hundreds of stores to reduce costs
Yea they're closing under performing locations. Also which state? Hard to believe every physical location is GOOB.
Today, my profit came from SPG stock, SPY calls, and short LMND puts
This year was faker than Kylie Jenner

I'm going to buy more palantir
how you know next week is normalize??
That as well. The other day my friend was telling me about the major tourist city in columbia. 20 bucks per gram for pure coke, attractive and cheap prostitutes' everywhere, cheap to live.

Hell, I couldn't find a downside.
Russell has taken a pounding this month. We need small caps to rise again. I think its the runoff. If GOP wins, Russell should rise again. Russel likes a divided congress. If dems win, cannabis and energy should go up. THinking of rebalancing a little bit into energy and cannabis. Maybe monthlies. on Monday. To hedge. 

Or maybe none of this makes sense and I'm a shitty trader.
I bought them two weeks ago. Theyre slowly not hurting my feelings anymore
Also, if TSLA had a P/E ratio like that of Amazon TSLA would be trading at 50-60 dollars right now. Is you stoopid?
No

Go all in on back back to on OTM options
Mango man posted a 2020 look what I achieved tremendously video in twitter today.

He states the market broke new historic high records today


What does this mean? As usual..... DAAAAMMP ITTTTTT
You don’t know what you’re buying puts on. And I read the response to the video you linked that you’re using as your reason to buy puts. He debunked it point by point. No, I’m talking about software. You’re not being trolled. Did you even read what I said?
Even though I’m alone I showered and put a lil cologne on. I refuse to enter a new year like a slob
there was recent news about it, think right now its just bag holders trying to pump though
The final step is to find your wife a boyfriend and your life will be complete
I sold whatever little GME I had and put it into B N G O lol.
Don’t worry it’ll be back down next week.

went past local GME inside mall yesterday, as empty as an abandoned shack in the woods
RIOT
My two concerning holds are AMZN and NVDA. I could’ve sold NVDA break even at close. Only reason I held both was that the MOC was super green and AMZN and NVDA both at the top. Hope we start the new year accumulating

Hey, he's got a partyhat, I hear they're trading really high at least! (pity it's not a blue one though)
I swear half you retards were made from precum. Look forward to fighting for tendies alongside you all in 2021
I was just curious.   I have been holding since may and have never received one.   🤷‍♂️
let's do a threesome....i mean 3 dead guys or 3 milionaire !!
Rule No. 1 of Investing : Don’t sell an unrealised loss on shares. In the WSB world, that means : DONT BE A FUCKING 🌈🐻
As least you have a sick fade and your place is clean
Yeah...there’s a lot to consider...Electricity, water, gas, sewage, internet...disaster response that’s a really good one too...can’t really know exactly what kind of sacrifice you’re making until you experience it. Something to think about tho for sure
it ain't real until Cathie buys, and then it'll be too late for us
was going all in on margin on pltr dip today the wrong move?

**I agree.** In college, I saw many of my smartest friends interview at Palantir and only the top people were accepted. The rest went to work at FANG companies.

&#x200B;

I also very bulish and have been since day 1. Have 20k shares, most purchased at around $10, but never selling. 🚀🚀🚀
Positions:

Jan-Mar: Boomer index funds

Mar- May: SPY calls (occasionally sold OTM weeklies)

May-Jul: DAL calls

Jul-present: combination of
SPG stock
CRWD stock
LMND stock
SPY calls and spreads

Sep-oct:
AAPL calls


Briefly interacted with some other calls and trades but the ones listed above are the ones that moved the needle
The software is locked to the cars, and therefor cannot grow exponentially like amazon and again makes the comparison question if I'm being trolled or not? Are you saying TSLA will be able to sell cars on the same type of exponential growth curve as Amazon who sells literally everything known to man and all you need to do to interact with them is a phone or computer which 99 percent of people have?
How are my calls red? Wheres all the money going? 😭

Yeah I think those are probably great positions. Life is so much easier when you’re a seller IV. :)

Don’t sell. It would be your biggest regret.
Thank you 🙏🏻

Mine also, too bad it’s been a rough day the past few years.. RIP Kobe!
Everyone here has been saying shares/LEAPs for PLTR for a month now, why didn't you take 100k and buy 5k shares and sit on those and play casino with the other 130k???
Good play to lose money
You'll have beautiful legs in 2021
Already slugging celebrating my gains, who knows if I’ll even make it to midnight
Try Scuba Diving
Just don't realize the taxes
LEAPs only stand for 9+ month expiration from current date, some argue it means based off date you buy/sell but it’s ignorable
I got in at 10.98 

I don’t give a 💩what happens and if it ever gets that low again I’m selling my kidneys and buying more.

you think a half-asked job deserves a flair? You still have 5k to lose.
Emotions are high, egos invested, 2021 is nigh, GME  heavily contested!
It’s 8k
When do they do their dividends ?    Is it annually ?
thank you for making my new year better...
Fk holding unless I'm SOL. Ill ride it up exit, then ride down and exit.
Great number man! Most of the win was puts on the drop in March.

Can never let an ATH headline opportunity go to waste
Last night I was watching bareback creampie impregnation fantasy where chicks fake that theyre not on the pill and it's the most dangerous week for creampie. That fetish looks like church to the maximum degeneracy of quadruple down on PLTR as it's freefalling.

+10% on my yolo portfolio and +12% on my roth that I opened this month lmao. Was up over 30% but I fucked that up with Nvidia yolo on September 2nd, been slowly building back. My roth was running CRSR and now PSTH. I started from scratch on March 20th. Truly retarded that I started investing at the bottom of the best bull market in history and I only got 10%.
I’m also home alone this year I have work tomorrow, your not alone homie!

Cleaned my apartment and got a haircut because I had a hinge date coming over for wine tonight. She cancelled. FML!! Now smoking hookah and drinking japanese whiskey on the couch with some shitty movie on. Makes sense I would end 2020 this way lol.

Watched you do what, buy backs? I'm confused.

I felt bad for all the PLTR retards so I bought 5 shares @ 25 so I could lose money with them

Guys the black bear James on Fast Money said he likes the Ark funds


converted 🐻🌈 or called the top?
This is the kind of talk I love on WSB. One strategy is great, less risky, and still highly profitable and the other is also great, more risky, higher profitability with solid reasonings as to why they both work. Then theres people buying FDs and wondering how everyone else is pulling this off

Anyway you're selling me on those march calls. I like the thought process behind it. I'm gonna put 10k on it soon and was probably just going to do the 12/18 $25 calls to play it safe because that's a decent amount for me, I figure I could also capture some growth after the initial spike from the acquisition announcement. But I can get more contracts for march, breaking even seems pretty likely, and I can always roll the contracts out if I profit. Wtf do I do bro

Don't spread it too wide, I would pick 2 at most. I just sold all my ARKW to move into ARKQ and I think it will be the compliment to my ARKG. But not the worst idea honestly.
I just need the DOW to drop 50% Monday to make up for my 2020 losses

The movie was so stupid that It was great.
This sub justifies your “Sorry, I’m extremely busy right now.” text.
As do I usually but mostly the weaker ones like FUBO or GME. PLTR has a lot of potential and is backed by some big people and the might of the government. I’ve done some reading about them at least. They didn’t debut to much fanfare so that showed me it wasn’t memed off the bat, WSB only jumped on once they saw all the institutional interest after a couple weeks. And since I’m a seller the IV was good to take advantage of. My strikes are 30, 40, 50% OTM. I feel good about it. End of year sell off to me was def profit taking plus fucking all the call volume. At one point there was like 80/20 interest in calls to puts. That crowded a trade is gonna get FUCKED
You sound bitter for some reason
Are you groping any young tourists right now?

The thing I'm looking forward to the most in the next 3 months is someone who had a huge gain in 2020 realized it and then blew up their account before filing taxes in 2021. Phantom taxes are always good.
i fucking hope so
You’re for sure on the wrong sub my dude. These degenerates are just going to advise you to maximize your risk before talking about your wife’s boyfriend and suggesting you turn tricks behind Wendy’s to recoup the losses they convinced you weren’t going to occur.

You're lucky you made that money and lost it all in the same tax year.

Had you made 98k in 2020 and lost it in 2021 before paying your taxes, you'd still owe 20k to 30k in taxes (depending on your resident state).

Then you would only be able to deduct your losses against future gains or deduct up to 3k per year against all other income.

When’s that? Was it when tesla split stock at ~2000? Well that would have sucked to miss the post 5:1 split rally to 700+.


My TSLA cost basis is like $35 split adjusted. Should I sell? 


No of course not. Tesla is the leader in not only automobiles now. Yes. Automobiles. The fucking gargantuan industry. 

It’s also top in battery tech and autonomous vehicles.


What does the green electricity conversion need to make its inconsistent generation work? Batteries. A fuck ton of batteries. 


Tesla power wall. Tesla power pack. Tesla mega pack. Giga pack. Ultra packs. 


Every utility will have the big battery parks. Every home will have a Tesla power wall or two. Most facilities will have them. 


So Tesla is going to dominate the car industry, the utility industry as it will also help push decentralization as most renewables are large MW projects like a coal plant is, and the new upcoming autonomous industry. 


Tesla $5,000 by 2023. I’m holding.
Hopefully watch my account not lose 10% like I did today. 
I'm probably going to drop more into my losing positions as I think they are still good trades just had timing I had. $BBY and $XLE.. Did a comprehensive DD on BBY earlier today

You seem like a very stable person. It really is too bad you lack the understanding to get that it wasn't a put down of any race at all, it was a put down of the country and system that by design creates racial inequality to such a degree that being white is always safer than being black regardless of material wealth. I'm not sure how many ways I need to explain this but here's one more. Read between the lines a little more next time. But alright man, keep slurring.

No sir. I usually stay out of the meme stocks because I can’t predict them. PLTR was certainly overbought, but that isn’t to say it can’t be overbought more. They have their Washington post discussion event on the Covid response on Jan 7 and then their software demo day in late Jan. Does that bring back big momentum to the stock and screw the shorts? I have no idea, so Apple calls for me it is. But I will enjoy watching you all from the sidelines. :)

May be worth a little vacation to see exactly how much you sacrifice in terms of infrastructure to avoid taxes. TBH I feel like I would be very willing to compromise on less-than-par public works just to have more autonomy with my money. I have a strong feeling the percentage of US taxes that go to things any average person actually uses is so minuscule you may not even notice that dramatic of a difference in a poorer country that focuses primarily on the essentials
[deleted]
Takes time.  Consecutive positive ERs. Doesn’t happen overnight and will not happen in near term with short sellers pushing price downward.  I think late Feb through mid May will be when it will move.  Stay away from options.  MMs will have a field day with clearing those.  My plan is to see where the company is at in 3 years.
XL fleet's fair value is over $30/share. January/February it will hold steady at around $30 and then after the first earnings go up to around $55.  I have over sixteen thousand in leaps and shares.

> My question is, considering TSLA is valued more than basically all the other manufactures combined, couldn’t you say it’s priced for perfection at this point.

Oh hell no. It's so fucking undervalued. There's no other place that you can put your money that in several years to ten years you can be guaranteed a doubling or tripling of your cash. 

When they announce the next four factories, such as India, the stock will increase again.

> And to your point about competition, you state you would have to be dumb to not transition over to EV by 2030, so doesn’t that indicate that now there will be a flood of EV competition where the incentives perhaps were not there before?

Ha ha... there's a flood of EV competition right now, today. And Tesla keeps on growing with the growing market. Transitioning isn't cost free -- it's a HUGE cost. Transitioning means that you have an anchor dragging you down financially that you have to support to keep your income stream while you try to "transition" to an entirely new product line. 

So you're going to see Ford going out of business or merge or be taken over in the next decade, and many others as well. Without supply lines and after they outsourced all their manufacturing of their vehicles they have no capacity to build anything new AND keep up their old poison-pill businesses.

VW might be an exception.

But when they merge people will say "but look how big they will be!" Just remember: two anchors don't float.
DKNG in Oct crashes because of 32 million share offering and huge stock unlock. DKNG crashes in Dec because.......well just 'cause.....
I finally threw in the towel at $25.50 yesterday. I feel free

I made a decision today, I'm just going to buy a single $700 share of TSLA at close and sell it every time it goes up 2%. I expect that this will net me around $800,000 in the first year, and $400 billion by the end of 2022.
This is the way
Ah man that sucks. 2020 takes another right at the end. Fuck this fucking year.
Because of their deferred software revenue. You really don’t know what you’re buying puts on do you? 🤦🏻‍♂️ Google it. Once they realize that deferred revenue they will have a P/E ratio that’s on par with Amazon’s.
I can do this in video games, why not with real money?

I ordered some Pokémon card packs at GameStop yesterday and got them this morning, also came with a free red bull. Bull means bears r fuk. DD completed
I was going to make a similar analogy. Poker players know that they have a bankroll and they have money that they live off of, and never the twain shall meet. 

You could save some of your investment as “tax” for and on yourself at regular intervals and put that cash into liquid assets.

You playing it all? I sold LEAPs to 2022 and 2023 bc the premium is juicy and I believe in its meme potential and strength as a company.
Will rolling work with this? Theta took a big bite out of the Jan 15's, and the Feb and later calls are so much more expense. For example the Feb 220 calls are more expensive than the Jan 150s.
Shit, you're right.

Only if you sell
It's one institution selling shares to another institution, it'll be reported on so we will just have to wait for the file to see who is making big money moves.

Could be Cohen increasing his stake, adding shares at $18.84 to his last big purchase at $16.00 ... it could be an institutional short trying to close their position without triggering a squeeze, either can be interpreted as bullish.
Could be during the day, but they must be reported by closing time

This is amazing.
Anyone else buying FUBO calls? Seems heavily shorted and oversold. Everyone on StockTwits bearish so it'll probably bounce back a bit

Thanks bud. I've got a couple things in the works and I'm hoping next year (in the next couple weeks) I will be able to implement more strategy/analysis for stock plays along with the sentiment and some of the other tools on the site.
Hence my expectation on any jump, assigned and profit and if you really want the shares then rebuy them on a dip I would expect on any big jump. Tbf, I am not bullish as the memes and DD here influence us to be. WSB is trying to dress up a pawn shop in the emperor's new clothes.

There's always another trade too, should never discount freed capital, especially after a profit sell rather than loss.

Yeah I'm gonna have to do my DD and run the numbers to see exactly how they manage to fuck you in all these places...I just cant believe how ridiculously high taxes are and people just accept them. I mean we are literally just being raped and nobody is really complaining about it. Some people even want to be raped more...

I mean I understand there needs to be government and collective functions but the percentages and the way they tax every little possible exchange of money/assets/goods is ridiculous...
Enjoy getting bent over for taxes on that

Well actually taxwise it's better to lose it the same year you made, if he lost it tomorrow he would owe taxes on 230K that he lost. Since he lost this year it's a wash.
I’ll have to pay taxes on ~$500 profit for the year. Would’ve been 26k had I sold my puts in March...
You are seriously a dumb fuck. It’s not about ego. It’s because YOURE IGNORANT AND WRONG. Jesus Christ, I’ve never met someone this retarded.

I went into PLTR because I listened to all the retards on this sub Reddit. Thinking it was a way to make a few bucks and sell soon, I kept PLTR instead. Seeing this chart, 5 days in a row seeing bears. I hope the bulls kick them out in 2021 and we go the moon next year. All thanks to PLTR

It's because the retards on this sub legitimately can't fucking read for shit. Even if the first four words of the DD were "buy june 25 calls" half these retards couldn't get it right.
Does that mean robinhood traders can trade tomorrow? Fuck yeah
It might not be PLTR but there will be another meme company along shortly.
Think critically about what you asked for about 30 seconds.
Dude thats just cringe. Take Tesla and Elon off that
Serious about the order or serious about my ability to spot signs?
It’s definitely the fault of some cabal in a smoke filled room and not the fact that you overpaid for a meme stock nobody here even understands what it does.
Hey be happy you didn't lose it all next week, or you'd owe taxes on $100k but have no money to pay it with.
lol Oh no, the downvotes from reddit users in wallstreetbets, my poor ego

Okay man. It's good to know that you can be so rich these days that you're immune from unjust execution and that racism in America is dead. Thanks for letting me know. Also cool that you're using slurs to tell me how I'm racist or something, nice one, love that projection. 👍
This sub is the only thing that made me laugh this year. I appreciate it.
How much was the initial investment.
I’ve never once lost people on here and have prolly returned 50-100k in profits whenever I drop a ticker. I don’t just toss tickers around unless I’m absolutely certain. Not in the business of losing people money. Plus my strategy is a bit slower and not as exciting like y’all love
Solid plan
Nah their option-meme days are over. Great investment though holy fuck.

Good 20-40% profit from plays if you time em right next year... they’ll do a steady rise.

My new years eve plans:

Bought a new dildo Old dildo  that came with the house was too small for the asshole built for it and now I see why.  The dildo is all crooked, not built thick and vainy. Old dildo doesn't fit in the back.  So now, ive ripped out the dildo balls  and I'm going lube shopping and will insert them tonight with a new dildo tech layout.  I wanted to do this at some point but was thinking in a couple years.
It seems to have broken support. I am going to wait until it establishes a new support line or take it off my watch list all together. There are plenty of other good stocks out there right now.
Pltr gave me L #3 of 3 on my calls record. Any tips for looking at the Greeks / expiration when looking to buy calls?

Why would only a few million cars justify the value when other companies worth fractions deliver 10's of millions?  


Why do people reference the car deliveries mattering on one hand, but then proclaim the reason for the stock valuation is because of people looking forward to things like batteries and solar etc? The logic of TSLA bulls is often so fragmented that I can't even tell if I'm being trolled.
Bro, they will be back talking about PLTR on Monday
230k is massive but not fuck you money. After you’ve gained 23x your money, anyone would feel like Midas. 


Then you try to build 230k into $5m+. Then you can take a nap.

Up 27.05% since September. That includes my ETFs. My fun money is up 41% and 32%. 2 stocks only TSLA and PLTN. Trying to read and learn about options, calls, puts and plan on growing my fun investing in 2021.
yes and no. Palantir doesn't need the government, the government needs palantir. Bringing machine learning and data science to the masses of companies is the way to go. Most companies still have no clue how machine learning will work. I saw that when I got my internship in data science and machine learning at a pharma company last summer. Man, they were clueless, but I still managed to provided quite some value and efficiency even tho I was just an intern. The potential is large. 10$ was definitely a value, but compared to snowflake it's still immensely under valued. I will be holding for at least 5 years.

Thanks for the thorough reply. My question is, considering TSLA is valued more than basically all the other manufactures combined, couldn’t you say it’s priced for perfection at this point.

And to your point about competition, you state you would have to be dumb to not transition over to EV by 2030, so doesn’t that indicate that now there will be a flood of EV competition where the incentives perhaps were not there before?

Here's a nice thought experiment way of thinking about it - If you were an alien who could change shape and appearance at will, an space being with no parents and no history, for instance. You could choose to suddenly beam down and appear on earth permanently as a rich white person or a rich black person. You really want to tell me that there is no advantage to choosing either option?

It is bad. 2k stimmy is nice and all but this market wants it from a Republican senate. If Dems win, there’s a lot more uncertainty about the markets.
nah lol
started with 44k, down 35k 

started trading the day before september pullback. yolo’d the rest on ups earnings. 

since ups earnings I’ve gone from 5k-> 9k

Right, but you can't look at 2 graphs and see that they follow the same pattern, resolution aside.
Markets would moon if dems win. Not a political statement. Just economic reality. A win would mean massive infrastructure bill, proper stimulus, $2k checks, something vaguely resembling a green new deal, etc etc.

If you’re feeling week go ahead and drop your shares at a loss and then FOMO back in once it moons in 2021 so you can buy again at ATH.

While it is an American company, tire manufacturing takes place in several states throughout the U.S., as well as Brazil, Canada, Chile, Colombia, Mexico, and Peru (so not only the U.S.).

Can you explain more what they're doing with Tesla? Have not heard about this at all.

There should be no reason an EV will need tires any more often than a non-EV car on a weight basis. All proper tire fitments will include a sufficient load carry capacity for the vehicle, with some load available (for passengers). However, if you take EV's faster acceleration, levels of torque, or larger diameter wheels with shorter sidewalled tires, etc., yes, that can and will affect the life of the tires.

What tires do you/have you had on your Tesla so far, and which model Tesla is it? Genuinely curious.

The tires might not need replaced as often either. The Maxlife tire has 85,000 miles (freedom units only) of expected tread-life which they warranty. Most EV cars for commuters will likely have 16"-18" standard wheels, with some exceptions on sportier models like some Tesla's which might be 18"-20" standard. This means most of these cars can use the Assurance line which is more budget friendly than the \~40,000 mile Eagle line tires which would need replaced twice as often, or more.

Insider information?
Most of my income is per diem
Short puts for Tues-Thurs is probably a good call.
Doing research is pretty helpful, I found wsb is a bit late on stuff lol. I was able to get into NIO really early at $2, and stuff like NNOX, WKHS early. PLUG too at $9, and ENPH at $30 (though I exited at around $120). I’ve since sold out of most of those positions. Those were all shares. Keep tracks of trends etc, for example semiconductors and copper both look really good going into 2021, and my head work in TSM, SOXL, and FCX are already printing. 

I played pretty fast and loose with my options plays as well, making sure to buy longer dates calls and selling them at like 20-50% gains. A few pushed 100%+ too which were nice. I gained nicely playing TSM calls a lot (which I’m still playing), and made a massive gain on C L N E calls (banned ticker, but I bought OTM  calls in November and they went crazy).

What’s most important is to have a plan when buying stuff, basically when to exit, your price targets, what you’re expecting to see by what date. Sometimes it leads me to missing out a little bit but that’s ok, overall I will keep gaining. 

In terms of losses, the only time I was hit with losses this year was when I made a greedy, fomo, or otherwise emotional play, so minimising those is necessary. 

I probably have more to write but I’m on mobile so ask any other questions and I’ll get to it later.
Market open tomorrow? 

Anyone else think the Dems winning the senate will be worse for the markets? 

A dem win and the market has to price in tax hikes while another big stimulus isn't guaranteed. Most likely we only get a UI extension in march no matter who wins

He said, hoping to receive awards
Joking aside, Options are great but they should never make up more than 5% of your portfolio unless you honestly don't care what happens to the money. The Gains posted here are inticing but you can take those gambles while also owning some actual stock. I think alot of people on here are going broke because they take these memes too seriously. This market is booming far too much for people to be out here losing everything due to dips around their expiration date.
Thats not what you fucking said. And it’s also completely stupid as shit to wrap up the entirety of being black into “being shot by the police” it’s the most dumb fuck thing I have seen all fucking day. Let’s completely ignore the millions of people that are proud to be black and love being black and wouldn’t trade it away to be you. You’re not that special for being white you fucking idiot.

Seriously? ...got me thinking
Be careful. Those states fucking suck for taxes. No income tax is great for people making millions of dollars per year because they don’t have to contribute to society, but for poor or middle class people it’s absolutely miserable. No income tax doesn’t mean no tax, it just means tax in different ways. And because they don’t have income tax they have sky high sales and property taxes. And unlike income tax, you always have to pay those no matter what. I had my property taxes run up 400% on me while my income stayed frozen for several years. An income tax would have never done that because it would have only gone up if my income went up. 

I’m moving to denver now to get out of the heat, and property taxes are a tiny fraction of what I was paying in Texas. States with no income tax just have the poor and middle class pay more taxes to pay for the rich getting giant tax savings. It’s a regressive system.
What were the plays?

I’ve had FLIR on my watchlist since May or so when I made some gains off it and was waiting all fuckin year to see where it was gonna go. Recently it has risen from low of around 37 to high of around 44. ARKQ has loaded up on it since October. Some April/July otm strikes have decent OI in them. 

I personally got 60c for July which only has 500 OI but there are better options with multiple thousands in OI. Do your own DD because I’m retarded and literally did none besides ARKQ bought the shit out of it and it’s in an uptrend. Looking like it could be a promising play though.

You differentiate a buy and sell order depending on whether it takes place at the bid or ask price. If all 951k shares were buy order, the price would move up significantly as it blows past existing limit orders. 951k volume on the other hand could mean 475k sell orders and 476k buy orders. Resulting in much less price movement than a straight up 951k buy order.

Wow no fucking shit you retard. I was comparing the two in terms of hype and potential growth you fuck. Of course they are different. One's data something spy something and the other is biology something geno something

I'm just here to bitch about having sold my QS puts for a loss when it went sideways Monday. If i had held (which i wouldn't have anyways) it would have been worth $120k in profit. Nice what if to end the year.

we have a vaccine for smallpox so it shouldn't be an issue making one for the new version

we also have other coronavirus vaccines that we copypasted to make the covid one
This is pretty cringe
Just like it’s better giving head than getting it
If you only lose taste and smell as a symptom of Covid it IS A DISGUISED BLESSING.

I joked about it before but im seriously considering moving to Florida or Texas now to at least avoid the state side of things. Or even Grand Cayman or something to get out of federal taxes too
This is real shit. Not a pump n dump. Also it's small cap. This has received little attention on here.

I didn't do full DD like fuck that you know? But here you go

The company's technology was recently reviewed by some firm or whatever. It's considered one of the best out there if not the best. Cheap and very effective. They were also mentioned by Harvard. Someone from ARK reached out to the company recently. Yesterday's volume was 7,000% of the average. Today's volume was about half of today's.

Much of the volume is coming from the big fucks. JP Morgan, Vanguard etc etc. Get in now
judging from these stickers, ur annoying af. also, u remind me of myself...bitch
I got some german beers im gonna crack open soon
You have a better chance of spreading your wings and physically flying to the moon yourself than this pos going anywhere but down.
Lol I mean it can’t hurt to know if there is a massive sell wall and you’re betting the stock will go up.

I'm going to be honest with you; you can't look for something easy. That project sounds hella fun but the chances of success are just too low. You have to barrel down, do work and become a valuable asset. If your not progressing, youre falling behind.
yup. college kids are screwed. I know at least in animation it used to be pretty heavy local employments for fresh talent, now that so many studios are remote, they are hiring more experienced remotely.

They are down so why is spy up

Comments like that proves they ain’t a reputable investor! #yourwifelikesmystrategy 🚀

Just in time to not pay taxes... Nice
I could see a little spike, esp. if there is any funny business with the transition of power. My experience is that UVXY moves a bit slower with the news than VXX so I may put a little money there. For a hedge if nothing else, thanks!
I’m of the minority on this opinion but it was so interesting to me.

Have you considered actually getting one of those job thingeys
Bought it at tippy top for 55.38 and sold it at 43 bucks in dec
there's no money in youtube, because millions of people are trying to do the same thing as you and the algorithm is unforgiving. your chances of blowing up and going viral are like 0.0005%

get an actual job
I go to college for free tho

Did Karp tell you that himself?
Damn you!
I think they won’t be updating us for a while as the whole company was essentially on vacation since the test failure.   

So they still need to fix the problem and check everything else on the spaceship to make sure no other issues pop up.  Until they can go back to space.

That’s a long time for the stock to go down.  I think we are only half way through this correction.  Buckle up
Hot damn, it’s fun giving awards.

I’m sorry for your loss. I’ll drink to that.

WTF you talking about, I bought my calls right when retards on this sub started doing it, I literally witnessed the post shoot it up, bought at 1.45 and their at 2.14 right now. 47% gains on the 2 jun 18 calls since WSB "tainted it".

I doubt it’ll go below 240. Anything under 270 is a steal for the amount of growth SNOW is doing. Valuation is obviously ridiculous but that’s not clearly not a factor for growth companies in this market lol
You got no balls. Go ahead and tell them “yeah I said I’d rather be poor and white than rich and black and don’t understand why people got so upset, cause black people get killed by cops right?

What do you guys think about starting and filming a day in the life yt channel featuring people of all different jobs. Like someone who sells cars, someone who makes pizza, someone who's a portfolio manager, teacher etc. I feel like people would be very interested in that. Kind of at crisis right now

continuing to buy FDX calls, IV is getting crushed even on 6+ month options. Completely oversold here and this will move back to $300 this quarter.

GE will moon this year compared to it's recent stagnation. Got shares and calls.
being wsb, we'll just revive this monday
2 dollars on a 20 dollar stock is like %10 my guy especially when your playing with big money it adds up! But then again that would be the not retarded take sooo....😎 I mean GME 😎🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀
Yeah I also have 1k shares I was thinking of long calls but I just love spreads so much and for such a cheap debit it was a no brainer.
That is not the way
I mean I bought 100 shares of pltr at the start and sold near the top on RH and bought whatever like 100 dollars worth on cashapp when it was like 15 and 18 , I never really touch cashapp investments , where RH I try to sell at the top.  Collect gains around 20% and reinvest the gains in new places or try an option . RH account is -6% all time and cashapp is +18% all time , and started investing with both in april 2020
This is the way
Take this shit over to r/pennystocks
Next what you want to do, and this is very important so read very closely. What you want to do next, in this exact order so read it again: what you want to do is FUCK OFF WITH YOUR $50 BULLSHIT!

Just look at the volume of limit sell orders (red) to limit buy orders (green). If it’s overwhelmingly tilted to one side or the other then you can usually expect the stock to move accordingly. It changes throughout the day. I’m in a stock right now that clearly has very high bullish sentiment *G-H-I-V* but it’s not moving. Clearly manipulation and MMs holding it down for days but I expect it to pop soon.

Okay man
Also, its tech is crazy shit. Top of the line shit you know?  It's like PACB but cheaper and more effective. PACB's market cap is about 1000% of Bionano's so in theory, 10 bagger? I say this hits $10 pretty soon. Get in and let me fuck your wife when this moons

Which stocks, so I can buy puts?
YTD gain of 112% 

Way too many insignificant plays to discuss, top plays included SPY puts for the crash and GLD calls when the gold bug started dancing.

Of other note, it took 434k of trading to make the 70k gain
Not sure why it shows 510 instead of 420.69 but kudos to you all the same
Upvote this shit to the main page, rejoice in Daddy Cohen
Thats the dream

I'm sure your son enjoys getting stoned with you, too.
I would call a play like that pretty stupid if I didn't spend the last year watching Tesla double its share price 3+ times.

This is the problem with white people. And this is why Dave Chappelle quit his show. He told Comedy Central himself “I can believe that my audience is smart enough, and hope they can digest the comedy.” They told him, no, they couldn’t tell the difference. You’re a retarded fucking white boy that literally watched a Chris rock COMEDY special and took it for fact. COMEDY SPECIAL. 🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️🤦🏻‍♂️ they shouldn’t even let people like you watch black entertainment. You’re probably the same motherfucker that laughs his ass off at chappelles show and don’t comprehend any of the nuances. You still don’t understand why what you said is super problematic and frankly retarded.
I like dips where there's some momentum in the right direction.... this is insanity.

Only retards sell pltr when it dips and buy when it goes up.

Buy the fucking stock when it’s down (aka now) and sell when it inevitably hits 28 again you fucker!!!
Down 5k
> Fair enough, shorts could cover before the A G M though, if they deemed the risk valid. There is no informational edge here, so it wouldn't necessarily be a suprise catalyst which makes me think they would.

Oh yeah. My wife liked to mix flavored vodkas with different flavored tobaccos. The favorite was whipped cream vodka with apple pie tobacco; tasted like an apple pie with whipped cream on top.
Fuck pltr
Very on brand way for the world to find out
Most companies with government contracts like this will stay private. You can't show a ton of profits or senators will get pissed and start having meetings. The private sector contracts will have to start becoming a larger share of the business before the books will look better. They just listed to pull profits out for original investors. I bought in at $10 because I saw a value. Then it went stupid and I sold at $30. The first time I actually timed something right.

How bad a time is it to be buying ARKG?
There was an article a few years ago that said Mayweather’s punching power was around 810-815 PSI or something like that. An average person’s punching power is something like 120-170 PSI. I would bet on Mayweather winning before I would bet on the bigger guy unless the bigger guy was well trained.

Side note: Ivan Dragon punched with a power of 2000+ PSI. He’d destroy both Mayweather and your average person. Maybe not Rocky though. I’d bet on Rocky since I know what’s gonna happen.
Let's just hope we don't look back at it like we do with NKLA lol
Right but you don't have to pay taxes if they're in some safe etf either...

You may feel like you are late to the tendie town rocket but I felt the same too on Wednesday. This is PLTR but with much more room for growth. She's a grower not a shower. $10 soon

Jan 1st - Balance: $353k

March 23rd - Balance: $277k (Covid dip)

Sept 2nd - Balance: $468k (bought up some stocks during dip)

During the first week in Sept started with buying OTM call options...then the market went down again for tech stocks - I screwed up!

Sept 21st - Balance: $308k!

STOPPED with buying OTM calls. Started acting like a boomer. Bought stocks and started selling covered calls. Also just did some day trading. Bought some TSLA and sold on the day of S&P inclusion at $670 (I should have held but was happy for my $50k gain).

December 31st - Balance: $484k

Haha yes you can but every share you buy on margin they get to use your other shares as collateral. In this case they will lend out shares you own and get paid interest on it. On cash accounts though they can’t lend the shares without your permission.
I thought I was being really bullish with a limit order of 4.25. Can't believe it went through

Depending upon the broker margin requirement might be like 80%. Since I’m YOLO GME in my margin account with TD AmurikatradeZ then I don’t use margin to prevent something like this on down weeks
Mine was like $101 and I sold once it went under $88. Might get back in eventually...  good luck

People argue at me "Warrants are priced in to the shares" and they are absolutely right. What they forget is the warrant value also goes up as the share price goes up. Then you have to adjust the priced in value of the wsrrant, causing share value to go up. Going to be feedback loop for a bit when transfer date approaches

Agree with price targets.

The covered call logic I'm not super sure about.  The amount of retail investors selling covered calls is insignificant to the total amount of short interest.  To prevent the squeeze at these short interest levels it would take options market makers selling tons of naked calls, and even then they try to delta hedge so they would be buying up shares which drives up the price.  

As of right now TD Ameritrade is showing an open interest of 406,622 calls for all of GameStop cross all strikes.  That's about 40 million shares and we're still at least 20 million short even if they were all ITM.

Very possible for a longer term squeeze like OSTK though but you're missing some potential catalysts.  Earlier this year there was a proxy vote with limited amount of shares being recalled.  We may get a wider recall with a majority slate challenge but we might also not.  Share recalls at 20 dollars a share will hurt a lot more than 4 dollars a share. We'll see what happens though.

I really... really hope you all didn't get caught up into buying calls at the end. You think we're just going to continue going to the moon on Monday? God Speed.
My point was specific to one catalyst. A vote. If Cohen goes for a majority slate board at the next annual meeting, there WILL be a share recall and there will be mass short covering. This is the only reason I think we will ever get a short squeeze. Last proxy vote caused a 2x in share price in a short period. This will be much bigger if it does transpire.
Based on his tweet today, I further believe in this scenario as the most likely outcome. Holding long until it plays out.
I turned my 700c into a spread yesterday like an asshole. Could have been up $2k today, but nah $200 way better 🙄

I believe $100 by eoy. Yes i know im stupid because target isnt confirmed yet. Spacman will pick a good target and the market will run fuckin wild. Plus if you understand the tontine structure, the warrant transfer lockin date is going to be an even more insane run up than LOI in q1
Nba sucks
In your account settings it should have an option to enable Margin. Make sure that is disabled. That way they don’t lend out your shares without you knowing it thus helping Melvin and their gang of shorts.

Same mindset I don't care about short term red weeks... the guys worrying are overleveraged or can't afford to lose money like pussies. I keep piling more money into it.
It's either that you're retarded or the hedge funds are out to get you.

We eat crayons here, not draw with them. Get with the fucking program.
So you know "Black Friday" where all kinds of stuff goes on sale, and people line up and fight each other over it?  Well, PLTR went on sale.  And people *loved* it.  So the dudes at the top were like, "OH...  YOU WANT MORE?"  and the consumers were like,  "HELLS YEAHS WE DO!".  So they keep running sales to appease their customer base.
PLTR gang hold strong. There will be haters, there will be doubters. We might go down 30%, just buy the fucking dip. In several years time we'll be fucking loaded, this company is going to do nothing but dunk for decades.

I think PLTR can go to the moon but not in weeks. I got shares and leaps but definitely not weeklies. I agree that pump and dumpers are probably causing lots of losses for those who believe the hype and think 🚀🚀🚀🚀 will happen in days.
Theory: the pharmacist who left the vaccine out overnight had PUTs and was trying to trigger a crash.

Watch out boys - too many greedy people could easily generate bad news with this stuff.
Money is not a reason to rope. If you still have your health or friends or a pet or anything then there's no reason to die. Even if all you have is jerking off to belle delphine and watching anime there's always something to live for.

I'm holding 1000 shares at $82 cost basis. Might consider it a long term hold if it keeps dropping. If bill gates invested in it, it must be good!
think about it - if your up BIG on your TSLA shares, its better to wait for the new year to cash them out and then play the profit for the entire year of 2021 to possibly make new profit to pay the old tax bill.
yeah buying a lot of retarded ass contracts like that will tend to do that to ya

Why buy them at $19 when you can buy them at $17 on Monday?
Not gonna post a DD thread on this because this ain't proper DD but I think Opendoor is a strong buy right now (disclaimer: am holding shares). 

It's been dumping throughout the week not because of any actual bad news- most likely people taking profits because it went public via spac.

Cathie holds opendoor; Merrill Lynch still rates it as a buy; it's mega undervalued compared to its competitor Zillow. At the very least, it's highly oversold rn.
CRSR will end next week over $40. It is time.

Happy New Year, Nate!

Funny you should ask. I literally just asked my consigliere about that play. I’m not in on Dec calls yet. $40 is money. It’s silly. I just need to decide the ratio between the commons (tontine🤩🤤) and the power of options. I don’t think you can go wrong with 40c for Dec 2021 though. Anyone knows that I think. This isn’t investment advice though you gotta do what makes sense for you. If you’re leveraged maybe commons are better? I would think carefully about Jan calls, even tho Ackman has backed up his intention to announce in Q1 we don’t know when. Personally I think end of Jan post Biden entry it’s happening. Anyways, good luck. In short, I will likely liquidate some stagnant bullshit next week and dump some capital into Dec 40c (or another strike I honestly haven’t reviewed them recently)!
PSTH gonna make me a quarter milly after tax on my debit spreads if it's over 30 end of next year. Gonna be long term cap gains too I'm drooling at the thought I'll put 200 into blue chips and divvy stocks and yolo the other 50 on something stupid
Just popped in r/conservative and they're saying Mitch is working with the CCP. Lol. What's happening.
[deleted]
I don't have any idea what the UK rules are, but I bet you they are similar, there's an important principle about realized versus paper gains and losses. The taxman does not come after gains or losses until they're realized.

I do not know if these 1231 contracts are considered realized losses to offset his tax liability in 2020. The settlement date on us contracts is probably the date that matters and it is about 3 days after you decide to buy or sell the option
[removed]
I hope you double your gains (and losses) in 2021!

Double-check that your options loss is going to use 12/31 for the date and not the settlement date for your losses.   
   
If you can't apply that loss to 2020, you're gonna be left bag holding a lot of realized gains.
[deleted]
you are not wrong. i will see what transpires this weekend and evaluate.  not that i am turning down $1-2k but when my total value in GME is $300K...why worry about losing big gains for that small a premium.?
Imagine having “other gains” after this week
Lucky bastard, you're in the green!
I have so much to learn, just started recently and am up about 11% for the year. 2021 is likely when I will start Actively trading and playing with money in my “eventually going to lose it all” account.
You got motha fuckas in here posting up the most random bullshit. Worthless TA, no worthwhile information, shitty DD, have their dogs roll around in shit to decide what to buy... and you remove someone's post that's actually funny? Of all the stuff to remove... Have a great 2021 cuck ass mods.
But at some point you have certain amount of money that is life changing (buying a house, quitting your cuck job and prepare for a better job or start a business, leaving your wife and her boyfriend, etc.). And when you reach that amount you should probably use it.
Why do you need a babysitter when you're 26? You belong here

Bought $5k of 1 DTE 25c for PLTR expiring tomorrow, is it a half day or something?  Got them for a penny near end of the day.

Today’s PLTR dip was the bottom
Okay fair enough. But any idea on the margin question?
Looks like u get to keep your imaginary gfs
I was really hoping for 17-18 for great buy-in opportunity. Oh well. Even not getting there is positive (albeit unfortunate from a tendie maximization standpoint).
I lost 100k between F R O G and S N O W, the 2 days before Christmas. Glad I folded instead of still holding, I'd be down double that today.

Had to fold P L T R to ensure I had a green day elsewhere today, came out 11k in the plus for the day.
WTF?????? Greed is a bitch dude.
What’s the total gain so far tho?
Luckily I only put a few 100 in just to quell my FOMO. Not worth a post :( :)

I follow this dude who’s on CNBC and he tweeted hours before close that he’s going to discuss the $8 PT. He came on and bashed the stock with multiple analysts agreeing. I trust Hedgeye and Kerrisdale Capital more than one analyst at Needham. 

The sportsbook acquisition is nonsense, they can not compete with DKNG and Fanduel because of the lack of cash flow. User acquisition is crucial, which is why DKNG loses money and has low EPS estimates even though the stock rallies. Furthermore, all FUBO is a vMVPD which is a video aggregator. Nothing separates FUBO from Hulu, Youtube TV, etc. however, FUBO has no original product, like the other two, and I do not see any growth in this company to warrant its current valuation.

*Jim Cramer is known to be THE most hung guy on Wallstreet, possibly one of the biggest in the world. His cock has been described as "like an evian bottle", with gargantual thickness that would rival shane diesel and shorty mac. Im estimating his size to be at least 8.5" bone pressed, with OVER 7" of girth. he would have absolutely destroyed any wife's pussy. They need spent hours and hours on foreplay, gettin get her wet enough just so she can take it. i can just imagine them begging for it, with Cramer barely able to force it past the knob, while moaning and squirming, demanding Cramer to force it in deeper. She would have orgasm'd within seconds of taking the entire length, being filled and stretched right up to her cervix.. the orgasm would have been powerful, with her vaginal muscles clamping down on Cramersq throbbing monstrosity, her whole body quivering in euphoria. Jim Cramer could cuck literally any man's wife without exception*

BABA is a nightmare for any government. It's essentially Amazon + Paypal + Facebook in one company. It was pretty much what Facebook was trying to be eventually with Libracoin. The vertical integration is crazy convenient, but at that point, you're just asking to get broken up.

If you didn't sell those worthless contracts by 12/28 then I don't know that they count as this year's realized losses. Settlement date is 2 or 3 days out, and I think settlement date is what all the tax forms will be based on.
gonna be so much bigger though. I'm share gang.

Well just remember that TSLA doesn't have to have 7 factories, just announce the next four and it's going up.
I think that he actually will have to pay losses on it, unless he sold those worthless contracts before 12/28, their settlement time is probably going to be in January, so unless he does some real hard tax work, he will probably owe $50,000 come April.

You have to realize losses not just have paper losses by the end of the year.

I think that if he does nothing but throw the forms he gets from Robin Hood into TurboTax he will have a $50,000 tax bill

They wrote all the facial recognition software and license plate recognition software. They license it to governments and states. I know they rolled this out in California in 2014 or so. They also take a bunch of info government agencies give them and analyze it. Pretty much if there is any information trail to track either people, or a person they can do it. Geolocation, etc. They have access to everything.

On the topic of “bitchcoin” as you put it tho, I feel this already happened in 2017. It’s preforming because people realize that what it is the best option for what it was made for and honestly what I was talking about more then Tesla.

I came.
Been doing that since October. Had enough to buy 3-400 shares and didn’t. Instead I bought heavy into NIO and PLTR shares, scalped some meme stocks and  overall I’m currently down $25k.... don’t even want to do the math on how much I’d have made sticking with TSLA. All of that being said, I’m still too scared to buy it.
pretty shitty way to end the year.

Edit: misread your post, but yeah i wasn't going to buy my deep itm puts back or roll then out bc prices were so high 


I sold covered puts two days ago.  But the stock tanked and I didn't want to buy back the contract to close out.  That means someone is going to be selling me their shares for my high strike price.  I'm getting shafted unless it rebounds bc I'm essentially paying $33 per share.  Not an awful price, but it sucks that I'll have money tired up on this for a while

> The valuation has priced in narrative x10.

Absolutely false. TSLA maintains a solid 18% market share in EV's, which is to say eventually all vehicles, and has done this level for years. That is not quite 20 million vehicles per year eventually. However, that market penetration will undoubtedly increase when they introduce their lower cost $25,000 vehicle.

But even at 20 million per year, which is a highly conservative narrative, they will easily be a two trillion dollar company. Especially at their (every improving) margins and software add-ons. 

If they create X and include Tesla and SpaceX, expect their shares to hit $10k.

Set aside 40% of your portfolio in an index fund cuz stonks always go up, and gamble with the rest. Never take money from the first pot into the second. Good luck for 2021

I swear to fucking god if pltr isnt green next week I'm gona do something I heavily regret
Anyone here solo travel? I love doing it the only time I feel really awkward is when I go to a nice restaurant ($$$$ on Google) and go alone. I always feel weird as fuck but like to try really good food on these solo trips one night.

I knew It was in that regard, just unsure with what means what.

So the lock up period is when they can't trade. And lockup ends after earnings, where they have a period of time when they can trade?
No reason to get up until Monday morning.

Someone (on here) told me MSFT is junk because it can stay flat when tech rises but drops when tech goes down. I don't have enough evidence to say that's true but I've definitely noticed the possibility in that trend.

That said I've seen MSFT in a couple of other company's reports and I like that. I like that Microsoft is building itself into other companies, it feels like insurance against a bubble crash. 

No real point to this, just two musings.

Third time's the charm right?
Shorting actually provides a useful service for stocks, because when they buy back in, it cushions the blow of the fall. Either by creating a supply line or pushing the price up as well. It's considered to be immoral though, mainly because people are bad at math.
Exactly if he did it by logic he would go from 2-4K back to 3k
Still has plenty of room to go.
I’m sorry. I sold all of mine so I could by PLTR Jan/2022 $22c. It was all I had, and I have hope for the company long term. Here’s hoping it doesn’t go the way of all my other calls.  I’m down 33% this year.
Hope so
dont worry lots of folks in the same boat after this week fiasco

when does ur expire?
Leaps are fine, FDs are mine
Dude had half that from 2k! Yeah take 70k and let those dividends rack up more shares while you use the other amount to di autistic shit. Win win.

Don’t fucken give up jerk cock and don’t look at your portfolio before u know it 
News of a new contact will trigger buying
Agreed. I saw some autists here make some big tendies with GME, but I skipped them myself. I just couldn't get over the idea that "it's gamestop, for fuck's sake." It felt like YOLOing on Blockbuster in the early 2000s. 

I dropped about 9k on PLTR though. Think I'll just leave that one alone and check on it again this time next year.
I just sold my 100 shares of HUYA and HIMX to buy another 55 shares of NIO.
Lmao share lockup priced in it seems.
Shit crashed like 38 percent in spetmember
Surrender your wsb username, Dr. Patel.

Isnt the nyse closed tomorrow? hkx us closed, is there any reason tomorrow to even get up?
Why you people cant play safer after reaching a point of good money? Why you need to be millionaires in 2 plays?
I hear the rolls are out of this world 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I've added more shares on PLTR dips, and I'm still content holding it for the long haul.  I would never have bought options on it, though.  Wasnt seeing enough news of new high dollar contracts to justify the moves some of the nitwits here were leaving on to.  Sorry, but $300 million contracts here and there don't justify a $10-20 leap in stock price.  However, it'll come.  Once larger companies begin to leverage them for their data analytic capability the stock will grow.
And to think, not only am I getting stock tips but also chicken tender recommendations from wsb. Thanks for the reply. I will grab some next time I’m at the store and try them out.

Nope. Im getting assigned on the 15th
Lol how's it priced in? You think they tell employees they can't sell after lock up expiry cause it's priced in?
Smart man
No I just have April calls that I’ll buy shares with profits.
this is the bottom
Would love to be that guy that’s long Tesla and short QS
Why do I get the feeling that the PLTR will keep on dropping until their sales are 40x the stock price?
The medium-well cock and balls delight
I’m still down tho

When you do enter, post it, then I'll know when to get out.
It's exactly just that. China the last decade has done a "decent" job on cracking down on shit that became a problem in the US. Even if we see it as an invasion of freedom and human rights. 

Like Reddit shits on China for censorship, but yet a lot of us would be okay if we threw Trump and his supporters into a gulag. Do we really need ain't maskers to have a voice? People who think vaccines are fake to have a voice? Do we need to give a group of Karens access to Facebook group so they can spread this toxic ass culture?  

Social media is a problem in the US, China follows suit and censors it. It's just a difference in how people are governed. 

This isn't praise or anything, it's pointing out that China tends to lag behind because they mimic and copy a lot Western technologies, but that they also get to see first hand how problems arise when you give it to uneducated people.

So I don't know if it works this way for sure or not, but I think if you kept those 12:31 palantir options until 12/31 letting them expire worthlessly, I believe those losses will not be realized in tax year 2020.

Those will not be settled until the 3rd or so, and therefore when Robin Hood calculates your tax forms those losses will not be included. And so you will still have a six-figure profit in 2020, matched up with a six-figure loss in 2021.

I believe that you can no longer carry back losses, you can only carry them forward, so you might be royally fucked on that tax bill, basically you won't be paying much in taxes until you made a couple hundred thousand dollars, but unless you make a couple hundred thousand in the year, with this loss will not be done at the same rate.

Let's say you had a $200,000 gain, you're net effective tax rate would be about 25%, you would owe $50,000 in April, but you also should have paid quarterly payments on that income. so don't worry the IRS will let you get away without making those quarterly payments for one year, as long as you make them next year. So in April you will owe $50,000 plus $12,500 for the first quarter of 2021, and then you'll have to make those quarterly payments to the end of the year. There might be one some way to demonstrate it to one time gain, and not have to make those quarterly payments, but you're still on the hook for 50 Grand in April.

Thought you get those large losses, and that will offset your regular income in 2021, so instead of paying the 10% on the $50,000 you made in your regular salary in 2021, you will offset that income with your loss, and you can do that for the next 4 years of income, unfortunately your tax rate on the first $50,000 is a lot less than the the last $150,000. So you will offset $20,000 worth of taxes that you will pay over the next 4 years, with the $50,000 you pay this year.

You may be able to talk to a tax professional and explain your situation, and you might have a good case that you are lost was actually realized this year, but I believe that the tax forms you get from your broker will not show that, so you would want to document the reasons why you believe that loss is realized this year, I think you would have a really good case for them to be realized this year, because at the close of business today it is impossible for those options to be purchased for any amount of money, even though they haven't been settled, they are completely worthless. 

I believe that this would constitute realizing that loss, but you would want to talk to a tax professional to help you figure out the paperwork needed to back up that claim, and you may have to ask the IRS for a ruling on it to be on the safe side.

This is all of course if you get that paperwork from TurboTax in the next month and it tells you that you had $200,000 in gains. Which is what I think will happen.



Games and losses are not taxed until they are realized, by selling the underlying asset.

and you're thinking back to 2020 when PLTR was in the $20s,  pre-splits, and you didn't buy more. You don't want that feeling.

No. I couldn’t care less about Floyd. You don’t realize how fucking stupid it is to come on a forum like this and type up your little fantasy? The smallest dick energy I’ve ever seen. Why don’t you just go ahead and say that you’re so butt hurt about how much money he has compared to you. It’s the only way your insecurities can be projecting that hard. It’s just absolutely fucking retarded what you’re typing. Like, pause. A grown ass man like you is literally fantasizing about big men beating up people. You’re sus as fuck.
As soon as I heard we’re getting 600$ and all my money was in bag holding ARKG I went ahead and dipped into savings and threw 800$ to bo. Va. Da.

Might be too late now since its market close weekend but you can always buy back your contracts if you feel like your about to get your ass eaten without being taken out to dinner first. I think the stock will rebound eventually past 30 but you might be bag holding for a bit 💰Shorts have it priced in around $10 and with the lockout just expired it will keep going down. I'm aiming to get in around $10-17 bucks
Take 98k out, send to bank, do the same thing over with remaining 2k derf
saw GME store closing at my local mall. ngl kinda reminded my of radio shack but then again i guess they are shifting towards online so i dont know what to make of it tbh.

What Is Floating Stock?

Floating stock is the number of shares available for trading of a particular stock. Low float stocks are those with a low number of shares. Floating stock is calculated by subtracting closely-held shares and [restricted stock](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/restrictedstock.asp) from a firm’s total outstanding shares.

Closely-held shares are those owned by insiders, major shareholders, and employees. Restricted stock refers to insider shares that cannot be traded because of a temporary restriction, such as the lock-up period after an [initial public offering](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/i/ipo.asp) (IPO).

It’s alright there’s always next year. Or the year after...
I feel you bro, just hang tight. It will go back up, I know it sucks seeing red right now. Did you buy any puts to hedge, I usually buy some on any bad news, because it tends to be a good call.
Half of the planet is already in 2021 Patty, take your guess

Yup. Afraid jan will continue. Just have cash ready.
Doesn't matter to me, no matter what it is I'll sell it once it's 10% and think I'm supersmart.
WSB has been bullish every single day so far lol. Waiting for the Santa rally to end so this gets more interesting
I have 32 now, small portion of my port. I think like 6%. Might pick more up and boost it closer to 10% as a bigger bet on recovery but the technicals are looking like it could drop lower now that it dropped passed $100.
Happy new years
Pinochet was before his time.
So I’ve made my first portfolio ever on March 19 2020, which was almost the lowest for SPY ever! but I started trading in June started with 500 got to 12k then down to 3k and up again to 23k in September! But now I’ve ended 2020 with -5900 all time!! What a year Thank you all!! See you in 2021! 💚🚀🎉🍾
I can't wait for these 15 days to slow the spread to be over
You are a total dumbass but I give you credit for not saying "Hey, I never had that $230,000 in the first place, I'm only down $1,000, at least I'm living life." Losers who will never amount to anything say that dumb shit to rationalize their crap decisions and life choices.
Doesn’t really matter I know what they were doing, it will be going back up soon enough. It’s like buying Amazon but for a way better value
Shit show is the 💩💩💩
Just about to complete the series 

And yes PLTR 🚀🚀 25c 1/8/21
Hmm 15k shares is an easy 2k per week with safe, deep calls. Worst case scenario profit on a jump and buy back a dip.

Well... what are you holding cool guy?
It's pretty great for hangovers.
Same here. I'm pretty much all in at this point. Averaged down quite a bit, but still hurting after the last few days.

I've been playing with the numbers in my model and can't come up with any plausible scenario that doesn't put us over 66 events at some point this weekend. Think the timing of the announcement will depend on how quickly the DSMB can review/analyze the data. I think that should happen pretty quickly with how bad things are in the UK right now.

From what I've gathered on other message boards, doesn't seem like the US phase 3 trial will have any problems with enrollment. Apparently some trial sites are already fully booked. Seems to be two drivers for fast enrollment: supply constraints with MRNA/PFE preventing people from being able to access them and concerns over mRNA vaccines and the side effect profile.

Last point is that I think the urgency of the situation in the US increases the likelihood that UK data will be allowed to be used for US emergency use authorization. Fauci said they're already considering deviating from the standard dosing protocol for MRNA/PFE's vaccines which would be a risky move since that wasn't tested in clinical trials and we don't know durability of protection. The takeaway is that it signals desperation. Given the quality of UK clinical trials (arguably better than the US), I can't imagine a scenario in which UK data is insufficient for  EUA in the US.

We'll find out soon enough. I'm hoping for Monday morning PR.

I also love index funds.....you would hate me soo much the more you knew. Example....I sold Tesla pre-split @ 275 a share. I sold Netflix and Apple about 2 years ago to buy more Index funds. I cashed out a good portion of my 401k S&P this year @ $3,452 to pay off my house.  I am the gayest of bears. I should be banned from this sub now that you know probably.
Yeah I'm not concerned about the long term play at all, I think it should be an easy win in the 3-5 year window. Every business will be using this stuff...and government.

He’s right just hold. I’ve been a welder/fabricator for most of my adult life. I called one of our suppliers directly and straight up asked him about supply and pricing and he confirmed a lot of what’s already been said on these threads. Prices for metals are rising and the lead times keep growing. He told me they were usually able to fulfill order within a few days. Now it’s taking about three weeks. The last time I experienced this scenario was when Trump initially placed tariffs on import steel. This is something much bigger and entirely different.

I bought 100 shares in CCJ right around when trump got Covid and it did nothing. One day I was on twitter and saw ccj was up 5%, for some reason I impulse bought $2000 worth of monthlies and was worth 8-10k two days later. Complete luck

Pretty sure the vast majority of the sub doesn’t understand the concept of shorting.  As in it’s like shares where you can bag hold and take profits.  Likely because RH doesn’t let people short which is probably for the best.
You asked a question and then answered it.
Don't be angry that you didn't buy any shares under $19. Today was your last chance. Year end taking was your opportunity but looks like you still didn't get in. We'll be looking at you from the moon through our solid gold telescopes.
If humans were stonks, this year I traded pretty flat.
I’ll take that color anytime too, so I’ll think that Robinhood is down and everything is forgiven
The thing about buying dips is that you have to make sure you have enough chips

why, do you wash the panties to evade CSI?
what are you talking about PLTR is a good company right
It prolly will no lie, it’ll be over 1k end of 2021

I beg to differ on that statement. There is a growing demand for edible products in many conservative states. I personally may know some people who make a really good living distributing to those states. The customers are older too. Imagine if that target population adopts brand loyalty for the top notch (legal) product delivery.

I've seen this number go up and down in the range of around a million shares before so I wouldn't put too much on that. Been deep in this play since august . For myself personally, I think I'm looking monitor the borrow fee going much closer to 0% with a sharp increase in price and the FINRA bi weekly SI updates.
Yup. No calls, straight shares. Will accumulate on dips. Happy new year!
At least you weren't like those employees who say guac is extra and scoop half of a baby spoon and then beat that spoon till the other half falls off and then scrape the rest on the side of your bowl
I will at a lower strike Monday with the money I made honestly
Also: huge after hours sale, GME. Glass half full?
It’s not FOMOing if you’re buying at the new floor
Oh, they get cheaper if you're willing to double current share price.
Protip: Don't look at this stock for another 2 years.

NIO gang how are you feeling?
Why would you buy puts during the year sell off?
I didnt get mine either. Stay strong it will come
Well fuck. My life is a lie and I am on the hook for way the fuck more taxes than I thought I was. Thats fantastic

The year is 2024, NIO is producing 2.5 million cars per year while Xpeng is doing almost as much along with electric aircraft. NIOs robotaxi industry evaluated at 1 trillion and its car and battery tech is revolutionary and worth nearly another cool trillion. Stock price is at ATH of nearly 1000, I’m currently retired and very very wealthy, WSB still yoloing on GME. Can’t wait :)
THCB,PLTR,JWS let’s go 2021.
I'm looking at the cost basis being 5003.22, not so strange when looking at it that way. 5k rounded up to next whole share.

The answer is yes. Always. You can always buy back in. I’d wait for a Green Day to sellCCs though
Pink Champaign fizzes and spits from her fine crystal goblet as she paints the last golden-crown accent on her emerald green toe nails. Her caramel-brown heavenly silky mane grazes the bathsuds, as she arches her back setting her perfectly pedicured toes on a royal-purple sued pillow. The Jacuzzi room smells of pink grapefruit cigars, lavender, newborn babies, newspaper and sex. It smells exactly like winning. 

The candles dance, flutter and swoon at her every move. With graceful damp diamond hands, she opens some WSB fan-mail. A quick flick of the wrist with her platinum dagger, the envelope is rendered useless as another one-liner falls tubside. "Dear Kit-Cat, I wood 😉.... just give me a break". She laughs gently as if she hasn't read twelve slight variations earlier this same evening.  In the blink of any eye, she crumples the paper neatly into a paper helicopter and flies it directly onto the over-flowing waste-basket. 

Her left-hand reaches for her laptop and wakes it by swiftly drawing two and a half identical perfect circles on the touchpad. She knows she is halfway to loading her Bed Bath and Beyond shopping cart with bathbombs, creamy lotions dreamy potions and other stuff they sell, 'to the tits' she thinks. 

She soaks in her meticulously refinished antique jacuzzi tub with a warm smile and ever-compassionate eyes glowing in the laptop light. A pop up tweet interrupts her tranquility. 

'I beat the market just like Cathy has, but you don't see teenaged boys lined-up and screaming in the street for Todd Notsobad do ya!' Her gentle smile holds strong, 'A monkey can beat the market my poor Todd', her fingertips glide through her slippery silk am she adjusts her glasses, 'try looking perfect while doing it and then we'll talk' she giggles for what seems like an awkwardly long time. 

Pressing the champagne glass tightly to her lips, she deeply inhales the bubbles before, in a single effortless gulp, she downs the entirety.  Quickly she fills her cart and without a twitch from her perfectly proportioned lushest of eye-lashes, she punches in her order information with the speed of a woodpecker, yet the precision of a surgeon.  'Submit Order' she clicks. 

Completely satisfied with the online customer experience, she looks herself in the eye and with the confidence of a true goddess living among Neanderthals, she says; 'Well Kit-Cat, to you and 2021 also aging extremely well, Cheers!'

Then she looks at you, the creepy peeper, and instantly she sees your inner scared little boy living behind cheap vinyl blinds and she beams a infectious smile at that lost little boy.  She sits up, and fixes her glasses without breaking eye-contact she says, "Happy New Year WSB!  May your tendies be on time and crispy, and may you all eventually learn to buy the dip, and not the tip. Now make like a good little boy and get the fuck off my property!"

They might not need to, but they will.
Smells like hibernation in here
Now do it AGAIN
What to do, hold a bag of flaming dogshit or buy some ulta and ups today which offset my p l t r loss's... I had to buy a LOT of the two but they did more than make up for the falling knife.
I wish I had your balls!! No kidding
At least you got all these cool Reddit awards now, so it's kind of a win if you think about it.
THIS IS THE WAY
And we think we’re retarded. 

Clearly they didn’t know that they could’ve bought deep OTM weeklies with that extra 20K then write off those losses. Could’ve still made more money, paid less taxes, then had a slim chance at mad fucking gainz.
[deleted]
this is the point i missed. appreciate the clarification.
CHUG! CHUG! CHUG! CHUG!
They have the best support of any company I’ve ever worked with and take calls 24x7
I'm over TOS, their margin rates are too high (9% !)
All of this pain is when you know relief is coming
Chrome or Safari is memory hog you need the memory
OSTK always breaking hearts
You got to know when to hold em. Know when to fold em. Know when to walk away. Know when to run.
Every dip an opportunity

At this point I can't afford any reasonable long calls in December '21 which is what I want, but am playing 99.21c Jan 15
Exactly this. Cohen is the new Musk. TSLA is what it is because of Musk. GME will be what it will be because of Cohen.
Nah, as long as you hold firm you'll make $$$
He lost it all
[deleted]
No one said anything negative about TSLa. I own a TSLA roof, I also own 30k in TSLA puts I’ve been scaling into since the 600’s and will add all the way up to 800 if it goes there during January. 

The valuation has priced in narrative x10. People bearish on TSLA arnt bearish the company, they see bearish the young and dumb retail who think they see a future that no one else does. Every bubble goes through a narrative hype phase, before nuking everyone before gradually growing into the valuation over years once it scares away all the paper handed retail. Seen this happen before.

Just wait til EOW next week. May the memes will be great and our accounts as fat as our cocks. Year of the fucking Bull(Ox) 🐂 Get ready to have more money than we know what to do with!
A few criterion: 
1. Only buy highly liquid positions. I don’t ever want to get stuck in positions. I want to be able to sell calls and puts as well.

2. Only buy what i believe in. I don’t have diamond hands. I will fold on a position I don’t have conviction about. 

3. Only buy shiz I can hold for 5 years and believe should 5x over that timeframe.

Welcome to Wendys can I take your order please?
WSB after this week: "HEY! You get back here, and you make love to my wife!"
Not entirely sure, but could be taking profits or cutting losses. Getting out of a short position can be indicative of bullish uptrend (just telling myself so I feel better)
THIS IS THE WAY - I LOADED UP ON SHARES TODAY
isn't that still you?
Holy fuck! The KING is still in!

It really takes you 300 seconds to google "is the stock market open tomorrow"? You could literally even ask Google assistant or siri and not have to type a thing out 🤦‍♂️

Puts on anything this idiot mentions
What’s your January prediction?
Wishing you all more tendies than you can imagine in the new year. It’s been a fun year looking at numbers go up and down with you.
This hasn’t aged well.  Are we still expecting blow-out earnings?
Did you ever think to sell when you made money? Or are you just retarded?
Sounds like the kinda did stop you.

32M purchase happened afterhours....
Hmmmm......Shorts covering or.....?
FUBO puts were the easiest money I ever made the last 2 days
didn't think that one through.
I only see 🐢 there
I try to avoid earnings one to many times of getting IV crushed.  But i think it has some room to run up to 32 to 35 but risk to reward for me personally isn't where i want.
Randoms on the internet acting like they are ballers and 1k is nothing to them LOL...
please fly again
Fucking hell the buy GME shares instead of mod awards needs to stop
If he realized his gains (like if the positions closed before the end of the year) it would be on 2020s tax bill. Since he had 12/31 calls those losses are realized for 2021. He could have fucked himself completely.

I liked him better when he was ruthlessly crushing his competition. He went soft in his old age.
Excuse me what the fuck happened to SPY? During the last hour it fucking soars to 374? Very cool, very legal.
There was a relatively big drop in price EOD today but my calls went up 30%. Could this be the institution buying calls to hedge?
❤️
Very accurate. 🤣
ya Karen was doing strangles on indexes with other peoples money. Cathy is buying companies with no earnings with other peoples money. I think Karen's method is safer
because you shorted it for profit and want to cover your position....

That’s what hitler thought. Imagine how trashy, ugly, polluted, and I evolved the world would be if you Mayo Monkeys were the only ones alive. And I’m not talking about if only whites lived because there are good ones. I’m talking about it mullet wearing cunts like you ran the world. There would only be mullet wearing children with blue eyes and blonde hair. Your inbreed children would all have Down syndrome. Yikes! So stfu you country living, deer hunting, rabbit eating, redneck, inbreeding, beer drinking, small penised, tractor driving, church raping, school shooting, lunchable eating, opioid abusing, sardine regurgitating.

What's your net worth
Sadly I know three people who've turned down promotions for this reason.
I don't know for sure, but the settlement date is a couple days out, so even though you put the order into sell them I don't know if all the tax forms come through as the settlement date. If that's the case then losses incurred on the 29th or later would not be included in this year's taxes. 

Also, if he did not realize his losses, by selling the worthless options, they would not be included in this year's taxes. 

It can all work out between this year and next year's taxes, but if you don't pay this year's and you will get penalties that will not be covered under next year's taxes.
serious question, why would a short need to cover if the stock has been plummeting?
Someone in /r/dividends would consider this a big gain
My DD was FOMO
CRRIIINNNNGGGEEEEE
FUBO is basically bleeding money, more than decade old company and is competing against dozen other similar services. Even Sony got out multi channel programming because they couldn't make any $$ inspite of have way more subscribers. Why the heck did people FOMO into it?

What else is there besides winamp? 6 mb program with an equalizer and visualizers, does anyone use something else? What would it even be, we solved mp3 players in 1997.
What in the absolute fuck are you doing?

Live by the meme, die by the mem.
Thank you
My father shorted (bought puts) at the top, he is gonna rub this in my face for the next year. I did okay I bought FDs in the 50's and sold at $84 and was bragging. I got a feeling he's gonna do better then I did on QS
Theres 3 photos here to get a better idea of my week and month .

 Now I'm running negative , I have a few options still hoping I get a diamond hand . 

PLTR 3/19/21 16c  

and I'm selling covered calls of WKHS at 4/16/21 45c  , 
but whoever bought that option has lost 30% of its value so far .

Ah, yes, the classical, greed that emptied the autist.
You follow Jack you get jacked
Sleep
You will be ok
It's 9:15, let's have a great day everybody!
Wait, markets are open tomorrow? Can't handle another red fucking day
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Lmao .14 on the 100k equity
F
Apparently the price is just dipping because of paper handed fucks like you. 

PLTR is up 135% since the end of September, and has pretty much stabilized between 22-29, I expect it to oscillate there with upward overall movement and occasionally breaking higher.

GME is up 180% for the year, with a volatile, but consistent climb starting in late August.

Just because you bought at a recent ATH and then bailed at the first sign of red doesn't make either a bad bet.  It just makes you a FOMO queen.
Going to 0 in a hyper bull market requires some next level autism
free money they give you to invest because they saw how good u are
I cannot believe you didn’t cash out ommggggg
You were supposed to destroy the losses not join them!!
If WSB is out then that’s bullish
You dumb motherfucker
This is a betting forum, a casino. Get the fuck out with asset management advice dude
Played the other side of mara.   theta gang.   got tired of getting butt raped on fds.  I also hope this shit prints.... but not too hard.
I’ve never held a symbol like i’m holding $GME
Guy on the right looks happier. Just sayin
Yup. People been getting crushed without thinking about how these mfers gonna be the though police in 10 years
How do you go from 2k to 100k and still trade the same high risk options? You must think your smart for getting from 2k to 100k but in reality you are just a lucky dumbass. A literal fucking monkey pressing random buttons could have stayed at 100k longer.



And why not switch strategies and start buying deep ITM debit spreads? You had enough money to live out your life on Fiji without your money being at risk each week. Ffs
I did 6/17/22 $360. 

Hoping not too retarded
I told you TSLA a would be down today
good thing we dont lose money until we sell. i will not sell and i see all of them recovering
So much salt in today’s thread
Thank you all for the memes, laughs, and schadenfreude this year
And you said I was mad 😂

👨🏿‍🦱🔫✌️
Condoms
I’ve been holding since way early, not selling till it’s Tesla priced because this company deserves to go up higher if Tesla is at 700. NIO will be doing half a million cars in 2022
I have, but didn't seem worth it really.
PLTR 🚀🚀🚀
I’m in this meme and I don’t fucking like it.
Radioshack didn’t have Cohen.

Didn't start trading till September unfortunately. Small ups and downs but generally did fine just playing stocks 10k per play. Then I decided to try options which has been a rollercoaster
Unfortunately FDs didnt do so well

Lmao
im all in on PLTR & ARKG

please tell me I will be ok

i need constant reassurance or my paper hands will tear
You should suck dicks and pay each tranny a hundred to keep quiet.

Nvm was thinking of the one titled 150ft fall.

He shouldn't be trading all of his life savings to begin with. I know this sub loves the memes and the yolo's, but he should've only been trading with what he could afford to lose, not his entire life savings.  He got lucky, then he got greedy, then he got fucked.
Sing it with me XL gang!!!! Cramer come home. Cramer come home. Cramer come home. Cramer come home.

At least some of you didn’t go full gme
Our king 🙏🙏
Yea WTF, shits going to $200 not $100 lmao
Gentleman, it was a privilege to sell options to you this 2020 year. Let us continue our business into 2021.

Got your fresh $AAPL and $TNA calls! FDs! Just like you like them! Hot ‘n’ ready!
I was thinking of the 150ft fall one. This is actually a different one so maybe he didn’t survive.
You only sold shares in a desperate attempt to recoup losses when shares have a fucking built in recoup feature called....time.
Ahhh . This is the bottom of the post..
You'll better hope Cohen doesn't give or up run out of money... Retards are only so retarded.
Have to do it Monday
hahah this guy “works”!
Here is your 🚀
[removed]
Sold my 700c yesterday for 4.95 😭
Look at the volume. It's a drop compared to what we've had.in previous weeks.
Man I remember when I was telling all y’all to buy NIO and Xpeng on the dip, y’all are always so late to everything lol...there’s still time though hop in anytime this week for a free account big boy boost. Where all the “patriots” at now? Can’t wait to see their face after the bull run fucking dipshits who don’t read financial reports or do research and instead yolo options in dumbass shit while I make consistent big money.
Second.
Fucking LOL
Get the fuck outa here with your diversifying into etfs ass
How much is that like 6k?
Fake internet currency
Lol solo isn't making the money pltr is
Places where some of your neighbors have no teeth, and also where  your tenants get a check and you always get paid

1/7 interview is about PLTR’s role in covid vaccine distribution. They are going to be dropping contract news
Why would buy FUBO without doing DD?
There’s nothing that we can say that you haven’t already thought you retard

Next time give me 50k, and you’ll still have 25k at the end of the week
this got me pumped af after this shitty day.
You are now free to move around the cabin.
You’ll be fairly upset when you find out how write offs work in April. Head up mate
I’m such a bitch I took profits and got out of NIO 

wishing the best for you Nio day 💎👋🏼’s
Bout to get in a new flair by the end of 2021. Mark this gay mods
Call them and see what they can do.
gme to the moon confirmed
Pretty much tesla and spy lol. Almost all calls never any puts just sat on the sidelines. Never really held overnight either.
Stimulus, but potentially more corporate taxes if a blue senate. Probably leaning more towards neutral

You stupid fuck,if you wanted to loose money like that you’d be better off going to a casino

Still got enough for about 500 GME shares. The ride isn’t over yet 🚀
Can't wait that long, I want my red envelope tomorrow!!
Someone is watching the meme stocks here and shorting them.iiluminati confirmed 👁
Idk man I’m retarded
Interesting
I thought you were a ruthless ceo?
I would pay off the 900k tbh. I know thats conservative  and maybe not at once but being low or debt free is underrated.
If FUBO and OSTK don’t have some kinda recovery next week, I am in so much trouble lol.
PLEASE STOP, NO MORE AWARDS.
To the 🚀🤣
Oh fuck....a bearish pattern was detected on PLTR via Yahoo finance. Wow......EVERYONE NEEDS TO SELL NOW
Lmfaooooooo
You convinced me. I reshuffled to 28s instead 

Should have done the spread... that would have been smarter. Def gonna sell the 30 on Monday
Wait isn't WSB automod retarded?
RIP KING. Noone will ever come close!
That does not factor in split does it?
How...

2020 was like.. free money.
He \*should\* be committed...
Shares I'm not so worried about. My concern is my 2/15 calls which made up a large portion of my position, which I why I'm hugely down right now.
near Kampala?
The child sacrifice
Just buy TQQQ
Yea it's not until next earnings these people don't know how to read
You won that much in Poker & Blackjack *over a month*? I'm surprised the casino didn't catch on and throw you out.
Dude..a stupid interview isn't going to moon a stock. Neither is a demo. They need to have some solid announcements,
This is the type of rational thinking that would have never gotten you that high in the first place
Not while I was there. They had to go nuclear. 

Best job I ever had. I'd pause, look at the customer, and go for a second scoop while maintaining eye contact. Right before I loaded it on I'd give a slight nod.
I do, it’s just funny to rub it in peoples faces. Worth the downvotes. Hold your shares people.
👲🐸  is gang goals
Wait, if Markets are closed tomorrow what moves can we make?
He sure as fuck does not
Doesn't start till Feb 12th
Where the fuck do you think you are? Of course options.

Buy shares and calls now. Then on next spike, sell calls. Then on next dip, buy shares and calls. Sell calls again on spike. Just do this over and over.
Yeah it’s all the same bu I just meant because it’s a higher limit. Roth limit is $6k, HSA limit is $3.5k and 401k $19.5k
I was gonna drop like $18k before on 2/19 $390c's around $2.30 MFers hit 3.00 missed a few thousand gain while i was too busy watching garbage tank
Be hungover af
Eh, it can, but having a merger target without a signed DA for so long is not the best sign. It may work out at the 11th hour of course.
That makes sense. Bought a 1/22 leap, thanks!

Based in what happened in Canada, I'm not so sure. All the Government weed I've had was dry, badly trimmed, and way more expensive than my plug's. I've had this plug since high school and he never ripped me off, always got me nice weed, and gives me free samples since I been buying for so long. Bottom line, no matter how many states legalize weed, your local plug will always treat you better.

That's what I was doing back in March/April. Thanks I'll look into it again!
That’s what I do. I’m just saying for someone that is about to take the L, just set it on a leap and never look at it again.
Today was my last round of P L T R ville and overall speculation stocks. Got burned badly on a couple of em during the 2 days before Christmas.

Short everything that went up 4x since march and that are 2x their all time high from dec 2019.
Do you know where you are right now?
Imagine having gains this year
Positions?

Really? Hmmm...that paper handed sell to lock in 40% profit seems very ban worthy to me 🧐

In all seriousness, congrats on the gains, son. Now use them gainz to buy long-dated GME calls and the autistic cycle will be complete. 🧘‍♂️
What did you buy, rockets?
Watching these fuckers try to connect to a younger audience while insulting their core audience is hilarious 


And the fact that they are failing to make that connection is the icing on the cake
I love how all of this expired worthless. Just so you idiots know, he lost around 25k.
It was at 28 last week.
what was your loss on these?
You won

With hindsight 69/69, imagine holding FUBO calls in the first half of December and then switching to FUBO puts in the latter half. Millionaire making shit right there if you play it right in just a month
I dont use robinhood but several platforms will let you do that yes. Pretty sure it still goes in as two orders,  buy and sell for commissions sake,  but I guess you can do the entry on a single screen/ window.
Wait did my $45 calls expire worthless? Dang 🤣
Let’s gooo
that's the spirit
Hey that’s me
...sounds like they did stop you
It's all relative my retard-brother. In fact, I'd bet you have a massive dong compared to half the morons on this sub. 

May tendies rain down upon you and your pp.

Damn bro, MF Doom really passed. 2020 can suck the biggest dick ever. Too many legends gone
Cathie Woods is pretty much commanding the Robinhood app. She holds so many retarded portfolios in her hands. This can only go well. 

Happy new year my fellow autists!

wouldve made more on oil than these shitty fucking oil companies
“He’s still IN!”

(SH my measly 60 share and one feb call)
Of course. All his messages point to it. “Buyer’s Beware”? Obviously because he bought more recently. Prevention over treatment? Obvious call to prevent and start covering now before the squeeze. The last time he released 13D, he tweeted. And he’s not that active on Twitter
So I made a post, and it was auto removed “for questions regarding employment.”

I contacted their mods, even though it says to not contact mods regarding removal of posts. There is no way to even see their mods (unless you go in threads).

So I changed the wording to make sure it wasn’t picked up but automod, but same thing.

I then posted it in my own profile, and shared the link in their sub...


Next thing I know I got banned in less than 30 minutes. Either they got butt hurt with my extreme low count of contributing to 5K new memberships” or the mods are people from higher ups in the company / specific team as opposed to your average store employee. 

Here is the [post](https://www.reddit.com/user/0ptimusPrim0/comments/knylz8/the_post_that_got_me_banned_from_gs/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf)in my profile if you want to read it.
The best index around.
This is delicious. Thank you sir and happy new year!
No man, in the US any position closed today is counted as realized in 2020
The stock is back to where it was before it ran up, so it's probably due for at least a dead cat bounce even if you think it'll go down further.
better to look at shorts in terms of float %

apple & tesla are also two of the biggest stocks
Just waiting for some more states to approve it, it’ll come
\+567%

First year trading options.  Pretty neat.
Hold. I have 8000 shares half of it on margin.
It was a pleasure to be with this sub most of 2020, see all of you fuckers next year

GMEs futures is a information distribution hub of statistics. Data is more valuable than oil. Whoever buys them will make their money selling consumer data off their established distribution network. Consumerism like stocks only go up.

You literally could have bought anything and just held my guy. Let me guess, option trader?
First one’s free
At least you lost it all before the end of 2020 instead of January 2021. Can you imagine how it would feel to have to pay the taxes on those short term gains that disappeared in January?
Did you just call me a spic?
Oh no worries, I’m well aware that I know literally nothing of stocks so I won’t be anywhere near touching stocks until I know what I’m doing somewhat. At this time I can’t even afford funding it
Losing 53% in a week with shares is impressive.  I think deep down you know that fubo is going to go back up in the next 2 weeks before crashing on the 18th
Nice win!
Yeah I’ve been out since citron post. Hop in appl for earnings this month and start the year off right baby
I don’t think guidance will be given when they announce delivery numbers. They’ll probably do that during their earnings reports at the end of January
New year, new ATH's! Great start!

I took a 3 out for a drive last year. It didn't fall apart to its credit but for the cost of a new 3 I could get a new Mustang/Camaro and have a much more enjoyable ride, with a few k left over for puts on F and GM. Maybe if it cost $20,000 I'd agree with you.
Happy new year, retard.
It’s a loan. If you can’t pay it back, they take your shares at random.
At least you wont have to pay taxes on it
😳
No anywhere. This is pretty well known actually. Short positions don’t get treated the same way as longs as only settlement date matters for short positions.

I gave up my year gains today. It hurts
What? Haha. Haven't had a single sees chocolate this year. Usually I'm fed up by now.
Fck man cash out 30k and bang some hookers at least man treat urself after that big win
can you share how do you get in early ? what’s your strategy of picking stock
its okay, you only lost 2k realized lost this year . better than alot of us
Thank you for your service. o7
IT WAS SAID THAT YOU WOULD DESTROY THE BEARS, NOT JOIN THEM!
Haha just like shll gang
ARKK, ARKG and PLTR fucked me up as well
Lol... Bruh u probably had covid and killed the whole mf reservation
So i did some research and it appears that it actually a holding company for produce vending cart manufacturers.
Ending this year red, what’s new 😒
Totally. I can’t believe it’s not hyped on here more. I find AAPL believers and support in comments, but haven’t seen it featured. When they see our tendies posted, they’ll hype. Apple has actually been my saving grace from poor timing on memes.
Go Badgers!
Seeing my gains this year all happy and then realizing I’m gonna owe the tax man a fuck ton. Hope I got enough to pay it lmao
Not really he would be fucked chasing that 100k at 3k per year writeoff for 30+ years!   LLLLLLL WSB IS HOME OF THE RETARDS!
A $4k leap bought 6 months ago is now $200k
No
THERE GOES MY HERO - FOO fighters
GME all in asap. You already read the DD stop hesitating
Depends on the time frame for now yeah they were right about pltr
same here, the rage and sadness all gone now.
[deleted]
IMO the only DD that remains is the size of the wonderful woman you marry after you settle down with mountains of cash
My portfolio is in shambles
If we are comparing this to industry leaders, I think it’s still heavily undervalued. I don’t think many people expect GOEV to compete with the market cap of NIO or TESLA, at least not me. I don’t think this company is worth anywhere near where Tesla is at, at least not anytime soon. 

It’s astonishing how people view what ARK invests in as a gold standard now lmaooo. You’re drinking your own koolaid a bit too much there. 

I could be completely wrong on this, but aren’t institutional shareholders a large percentage of this stock? That sounds like easy manipulation to me.

Stock is dipping everyday, oh well. I think something fishy is/was going on with how this stock is trading or it could just honestly be end-of-year sell offs and people taking profits, although this is getting extreme lol.
You mean in Canada?
One of us!
Tesla hasn't stopped. And just broke 700. And now it's in an index fund. That bitch won't slide more than 2% on the worst days imagineable. It's a boomer stock now.
Clear organic growth day
PLTR the next Macrohard
Yay ... no taxes :)
Pure greed, plain and simple. If greed leads your decisions eventually it will come back to haunt you.
Any read on stick plummeting?
Have those hungry people thought about buying TSLA calls? Fuckin dummies.
Oh ok, you are the OP are spamming together. Where are the worthless mods???
Gotta collect them all?
[deleted]
Not likely
Wow so you got the gist of the joke roflmao
Tomorrow I’ll be reading the email saying I’m suspended for free riding. Tos only said a potential margin call which was fine since I have more than enough to cover. Then I check Td Ameritrade and they have the regulation t call. 

So fuck it. Back to Robinhood I guess

What a retard. Some people learn the hard way. Unless TSLA moons 5% on Monday at open, those are gonna get theta crushed.
OP is literally the embodiment of diamond hands, gonna average down on my shares and calls next week.
Happy to see metals bros outperform PLTR bros this month
Any meme stock trending in wsb
It's a bit harder than merching because there are many very smart people doing it full time with much more info than you, it's really hard to be a whale, and even if you are it's illegal to actively manipulate prices.

My advice is to buy and hold, and stay away from meme stocks (especially after they've been memed for more than a couple days)
MY FUCKEN HERO !!!!

YEAH !!!!😎😎😎🤩🤩🤩🥳🥳🥳🥳🥳
isnt that not until feb ?
No. FUBO.
Citron was right all along? WSB needs to draft a collective apology to Andrew Left
So much for "BABA will moon Friday"  
Fucked my Calls.
I don't think you will have an issue just depends on timeline. CRSR can also pop to 42 for no reason and earnings are in a few weeks.
Goals for next year 😂
I'd just wait a few more weeks. Get out when you think the options have recovered. I'd keep shares and sell OTM options.
username checks out
Yup, I think Feb will be the low and then it's going to the fucking moon and beyond. Starting to build a position now.
THANK YOU! and yes better believe it.. i don't post much!!!!
You should have bought oil
I sold half my shares and bought GME. You’re welcome again. Can’t wait to buy more after TP hands GTFO
This post has more awards than comments. Wtflmao
Like Jack Ma, I have overstepped
I think you done gone and sold at the bottom
GME

Sounds like you have a job and today that’s something to write home about
As much as market news outlets have loved saying that the market has only gone up the fact is that it hasn’t. September and October were extremely choppy. November we had a good bull month and December has been extremely choppy. Only select names have had good returns in the last 3 weeks. I’m down 8% since December 1st. Hasn’t been easy.

Keep ya head up brotha we will get back to it in 2021.

I bought 400 shares of FUBO at $61.13 and sold today at $29.80 after losing 53% of my money in 7 days.

Agree completely, been buying calls up 150-250% since nov 25 at 115$, wondering if WSB would ever get on board this cup and handle break out which will 🚀🚀 best thing is the icar leaks will be the catalyst that keeps on giving
If you want to look at it this way, you really only lost about $1K on the whole ride
It ran 90 dollars or so with no news... if Elon surprises with delivery number and guidance then we are mooning to 850

I spent the last week averaging down from an equally derp buy lmao. Down to 25.13 avg.
I bought the peak 🤦‍♂️

It has been trading between 110 and 130, lately. I don't think it goes to 100
I think so man and this is a very novel space in which few people are building the products they are so it's ambiguous and unclear what the value upside truly represents. I work in data engineering and data science so i know this is true. Even snowflake is not doing something similar.

Should be good.
That is not up 50-65%
what ur position from 2k to 100k back then ?
wait don't options settle next day (1/1/2021)? so like his tax liability for 2020 is on the 100k gains and now he has nothing to pay it.
Well you could have fucked it up worse by waiting until the new year to blow up and then figure out how to pay income tax on money you don't have.

Definitely. Wouldn’t be a wise political move to push weed as a solution to the fiscal mess. However, there is the news of the merger. From what I know, the two companies complement and benefit each other’s weaknesses and their growth quarter after quarter have both been insanely impressive.

Canada's rules for loss harvesting require the trades to "settle" in order for them to be considered "realized" in the given year. For stocks I believe it is +1 day and options it is +2 days. So in order to harvest losses in Canada you would have needed to sell any stocks by 12/30 and any options by 12/29.

The US does not have this rule but for some reason a lot of people have been thinking it does today.
That's the spirit!

They're really hard to find, and you have to find them on low volatility stocks. 1:10 is an ideal ratio that's usually far OTM. On most stocks you can find 1:6 or 1:7, or around there.

Here's one on VALE that's pretty close (1:9) and something I would actually consider doing if you like steel guy's DD - buy the Feb. 19th 2021 $19 call, sell the $22 call. If you get filled at the mid for 0.30, that's a max loss of $30 and a max gain of $270. That's also right after their earnings, which are the last of the steel stocks, so you have a couple catalysts to get you to $22.

Actuall you dumb truck driving racist your ugly white girl kind looks like this https://image.shutterstock.com/image-photo/face-elderly-fat-woman-portrait-260nw-1691439799.jpg while black people look like this https://i.pinimg.com/originals/a6/a2/49/a6a249da933bd9026f1bd1e8e383a7a1.jpg and your moms Rice Krispies taste like shit btw. And It’s kind of annoying how she preaches live laugh love during her bible studies. Tell Emily that she is too young to make her self look like a slut on only fans and tell her that she can’t dictate what is minorities find offensive. And tell your stupid ass mother Karen to stop breaking up with so many boyfriends. This must be her 15th divorce. Ah she will always be a complaining bitchy who’re in my heart. And tell your “pUt dOwN oLd YeLlEr” biological dad/uncle to stop getting drunk and abusing your mom. And tell Jacob to just come out already because we all know he’s done incest with you before Kyle Bernstein Johnson. Go listen to Jason Aldean’s Earrape country music with you murican step dad who constantly complains and says “dEr tEk eR DeRs” and I don’t know how to translate that but your country bumpkin ass surely does. And once you finish listening to your country earape maybe you will get hearing aids. Oh yea and your little sister Lilly looks like a autistic pug. Enjoy putting salt mixed with water in your Turkey and calling it seasoned. Also stop shooting schools Kyle. Just because you heard Emily listening to Billie Ellish and screaming you don’t understand my pain doesn’t mean you are depressed. And why do you guys always eat Rice Krispies though. Is it an obsession between land stealing Europeans as yourself. I bet your bitch ass probably looks like this https://i.pinimg.com/564x/1d/73/e2/1d73e29835c2756a72ad0ba4be036721.jpg and Emily really needs to stop starving herself and calling herself fat all the time. It’s pretty annoying how much attention she craves. That’s the reason why her ugly basic ass made an only fans but she has no titties nor ass and is anorexic so the only person that will ever pay for it is you.so stop trying to praise your train wreck of a family and just sit down Kyle. No need to flow your mullet in the wind to attract your cousin

It's not harmless, so it should always be used smart. Too many guys without solid drive destroying their natural test for less than optimal gain. I just get concerned for them, no judgement at all from me.

Mostly shares. I have some 2/15 that were deep ITM, but now not so much. I bought those like 2 months ago and it felt like such a long ways away....now it feels like weeklies and I'm getting concerned. At one point they were worth 30k, now around 5k.

I sell weekly covered calls against the shares I already own at a $575 average, but I'd agree that the current share price is a bit rich.
Thanks man!  Happy New Jears!
Based on some of the arguments I see on there I would have to guess its just the biggest case of stupid retail investors hoping on the bull at the top literally ever. Some of the tesla bulls literally don't even know what they are investing in. They see people making gains and buy.

Guys FYI -- settlement period is only a thing in Canada. In the US, today is the last day for loss harvesting. Not sure why everyone seems to be thinking settlement applies to the US today
you’re up $113 congratzz
Benzinga Newsdesk
Seriously his post is retarded. I get small wins and goals and snowballs. But at a 4% div yield /year. This dude has basically just invested like $300 for the year. Thats like 6.25 per week.  Even if he is working min wage at like 7.25 per hour he is literally investing less than 1 hour of wages per week. This should not be a win but a massive failure. Either hes not investing more, he is heavily in debt, he is making less than min wage, or he doesn't even have a job.  All of which should not be considered wins in my book.

If you’re thinking selling at a loss, you can sell PLTR Jan 2022 $50c and get $4.00 back per share and sell if called at $54.

So even if you bought at ATH you’ll still make a killing.

Unless hes in Canada, the deadline for loss harvesting is 12/31. Idk why this settlement thing is spreading like wildfire today
You are lucky to lose all today. If you lost all tomorrow.....
Just sell and get a rope and chair now
Now why would a two year old account with a bunch of Karma be posting shit like this
Get drunk
Well, today was a shit show
NO ONE CARES ABOUT A SINGLE VIOLIN
Will metals fly again? Boy, I sure hope so
Fuck.

What do you think margin is?
Are there really people who played PLTR weekly options? Ngl, I just thought all those PLTR comments were from bots to promote option purchases. Lol
[deleted]
Ouch..
you ain't shit, but you still hit
My God why I never thought about posting this so I could get some sort of award. Damn you OP!
double my position to 200 today. WE'RE NOT FUCKING SELLING!!!!
No one knows
Mine didn’t finalize but it’s +45% now.. I just kept the same 4 funds and didn’t make a single move all year 😭
Shares? If options, when are your expiry date?
How did you make your money back after that $90k TSLA loss? Lol

Like seriously
Nice feeling looking at a portfolio with no losers in it
Very red. thanks draftkings, canoo, Corsair, Pltr
Oh he knows. He's on his way to take you Switch and Rick and Morty DVDs
Drop acid and think about all the acid I dropped in 2020
Hope Amazon splits or something Monday... Cathy got in around 3200 I believe
Wait I’m retarded?:( I had pltr 27$ c 12/31 

I’m not retarded right? Can someone help
Da man da
Buying it in 2020 was a good a idea, are you not paying attention to the 210% YTD?
If you lost money this year just sudoku Jesus Christ
Ban
Well played, Sir.
I think this stock can 10x over 10 years. The ability to sift through data is essential and the solution with the best artificial intelligence and machine learning will win!
Imagine if this happened the first week of January. He would be so fucked.
This New Years is gonna suck ass. 

Stop eating fucked up shit you China Mother Fuckers! 

If you think shark fin soup, cream of bat, pangolin scales or tiger penis is gonna fix your fucked Idiocracy. You’re fucking WRONG!
Was my worst "quick flip" attempt all year. STIC is drilling me right now but will eventually recover on the hype run to merger.
Thank you! I hope Karma shows you some fortune in 2021!
Last year today I was telling my family about being up 40% on a little known stock called Luckin lol
So not for me but concerning the dudes posting epic loss porn today (mainly ETHBAGHOLDER).. does settlement date affect taxation or is he safe?
soon as in 2030?
Sir this a Wendy’s. Sweet tea is all we have
I doubled down today 💎👐
So you think TSLa will be the largest company in the world in 2 years with a market cap probably over 3 trillion? This is the clearest bubble I’ve seen since bitchcoin and its due to retail having absolutely hilarious concepts of value.
Options provide leverage, so you can make other people money a lot quicker
The post which says about the post which says to buy GME instead of awards is also receiving awards.
I'm not a test advocate but I also don't really blame people using it to get to whatever goal faster, even if it's inside the theoretical genetic limit. Only bothers me when people lie about it.

I hope the stock market stays on easy mode during 2021

This is actually me in 2021 if the market tanks next week since I'm all in calls
Fuck off to r/investing
Just gotta laugh when people here think this sub can pump and dump a stock with a market cap of over $40 billion
I’m telling Mr. Powell you bully!
I'm holding. It's pretty similar to November's crash, so I'm going for a Monday to Wednesday pick me. I would be concerned about short term calls. Shares and leaps are the way.

This is either going to go very well or very not.
Patiently waiting for PLTR to hit 40
Yeah man wage slave job where you can work from home and day trade all day.  Employee stock purchase plan is nice too, my company gives 15% discount on the stock price.  

I'm a manager so I mostly just sit on calls and tell people what to do, barely requires my attention lol
Dude it will be green Monday. Trade accordingly
What part of UP do you not get? This thing is going up until the fed says something about raising rates. Wall street will step on your poor, homeless face, just to make a buck and the government will back them up by carrying the ladder they'll use to Bautista Bomb you so they can collect your pocket change. 

UP. Get it in your head or go broke.
WHY DID PLTR BETRAY US?
If this works I gotta try it. Just yolo on something then claim it was my little nephew or something
Have you been brainwashed into a retard by woke Reddit?
Should I use the last of my margin to buy some more PLTR?  23.53 looks kinda neat. First reply will be inverted.
The replacements have been Power Rangers far longer than the OG. The Asian black ranger was on the show for like 5 seasons
How are ETF’s weighted? Do they base it on dollar amounts or by number of shares held?

Your best bet is to swing trade this.. if this goes to 30-50 range or possible squeeze, right now is best it’ll get, give or take a dollar lol...

Happy new year GME bulls lets ride Ryan Cohen to victory 🥵🕹💦
Seriously though. Being a parent is weird.  You have this baby and you are like 'look at his great peepee and balls, what a cute little man'.  I've heard more than one mom say this kind of thing.
Why would they bother incentivizing people to trade? We will trade anyway
Like I said at the earliest cause I agree with you, buying now and holding at any point in the cycle is completely fine imo. But it will take time and their business model is not facebook where everyone seamlessly can adopt. It takes time to integrate and get the word out at how much better PLTR is than competitors. We'll be rich... in time.
Where can you find that? I'd like to look to.  I don't have etrade though.
Get the fucking bread essay
im going to financially recover from this

Every client they get is an opportunity to improve their machine learning and AI algorithms. It will only be harder for others to catch up and they intend to have the West reign supreme with AI.
He’s in legit trouble after he spoke out against China. They’re reminding him who’s in charge
why would you buy QS over 50 and not sell?
True, but the administration needs to lay groundwork for how they will handle the debt we’ve amassed. Decriminalizing will kill 2 birds with the same stone (police reform/reducing covid risks in prisons and debt relief) The fact that our government is being stingy about $2000 stimulus checks means that we can use the money sooner than later.
buy high 

sell low

how u doin
Shut up loser
Day was going great. 

Ran some errands to ensure I don’t leave my house for the rest of the weekend, because the weather is complete shit. 

Stopped at DG, KR, ACI, the Mexican meat market. 

Then I fucking did it. Never thought I’d be that guy. Don’t even know where it came from. 

#“See ya Next Year!” 

I yelled to the old man that runs the liquor store. 
It was like I was possessed by a 56 year old white tube sock wearing Caucasian mailman that just retired. 

Voice didn’t even sound like me. 

It’s the real life equivalent to 
**“Edit: Wow this blew up. Thanks for the Gold kind stranger!”**

**What’s become of me.**



#DIS $200 🐭🔪🐻
I'm aware. You told us on other posts
So thankful that I finished green so I don't have to see a red chart all weekend again.
I've made a lot of money of palantir last week and a half
Let's gooo!!!

Congrats on the profit.

What is this bullshit
40c 01/2022 for me but yeah same shit
I don’t care if it eventually goes to 100, you cannot convince me that buying GameStop in 2020 is a good idea.
It keeps fucking going up. The awards... they don't stop... make it stop
It’s not on there. I’m not sure why. Probably because I have added and taken money out of RH so much this year
Did you start with $100 million? Congrats and fuck you.
No, it means you like money

Gonna pawn off the rest of my xmas gifts over the weekend and get a few more shares of $PSTH. Anticipation of a q1 merger keeps growing. Beyond the loi pop tho, tontine structure will become a feedback loop as the lock-in date approaches. Will be ☢NUCLEAR☢
We going to clap some green cheeks in 2021?
buy shares, sell calls if you’re such a pussy

Wow good for you but your name and the way you reply to people make you sound like a autistic child.
I bought it like a year ago, played 5 minutes, haven't touched it since. Even when it's finished it's not going to very fun... Just a second set of chores that you have to do.
You really don't want gucci I guess
Everyone sells blow now it seems.
Shit are they just giving it away now
What a hot & fast year of trading its been for us, boys.

I liquidated all my positions beginning of March.

Doubled my money staying in cash and riding Puts into the end of March.

Stayed bearish for another 2 months and lost more than half my profits, waiting for the world to end.

Begrudgingly started going long in May.  Fully expecting to get ass-fucked by the market and the smarter bears.   Never materialized.

Reviewing my accounts today and I'm up 100% from last December.

We all war torn and weary.  Let's get this 2021, Retard Army!
Fuk
The king
Come Monday? Fuck that... It was EOD, EOM, EOY to buy.... today
Do you think it's going to keep going down? If yes sell.  If not hold.  I'm assuming shares.  If options then woooooo lot more variables to consider
*goes bankrupt and delists*
Who else is doing absolutely nothing tonight?
WHY THE FUCK ARE YOU ASKING MY MOVES FOR TOMORROW YOU STUPID FUCK
My stimmy just came in. Time for some cocaine blues
my grannie and my hs history teacher
Happy new years to all the bears, hope yall go extinct next year
Ahh I should have thrown money at that. Its run was mostly over when it showed up in the Halts.
Sorry mate. Like I said I lost all money tendies holding my TSLA FD calls. 99c any size drink and cheeseburgers.
Same, holding April 25 Cs and June 27 Cs.  No fear.
my final thoughts on 2020: fuck RKT
IM 🙌💎 NOT 🙌💎 FUCKING 🙌💎 SELLING
So PLTR killed half of us? Another extinction event.
Tendies secured for 2021
I did a poopie in my pants.

All the covered calls I sold expired worthless. We won!
I have the same.  I think we'll be fine.
I bought leaps in this month's ago and cashed out a few weeks ago for about 500percent.

I'm done with it for now.
And old people
The moment it ends as meme status on wsb with 🚀 🚀. You know it's game over and time to bounce
If they returned gains. Sell and Buy further out calls.
Bought in at 222.

Plz fly again BABA!

You gotta order club soda and lime, that's like code for the bartenders that you're not drinking but want to look like you are. Just order a Coke in a short glass and say it's rum/Jack and Coke. Trust me, the hardest thing about not drinking for me was no more socializing really anymore. You can't do anything with anyone and alcohol isn't involved, and it gets worse the older and older you get, too. The girls I've told that I don't drink seem to dig me more afterwards tbh, but def not something you tell some basic bitch at a bar that just wants free drinks lol.
Will the 🐝 go the way of goev? Seems like batteries are more legitimate
Why take an L when you can sell 2023 50c’s and double if called?
Since these February $30 PLTR calls are getting drilled, I'm going to start buying puts next week. That should make the stock move sideways as it tries to avoid my strikes. Then, I'm gonna drop an Iron Condor on its ass.

Your fukin move PLTR
We can't have a short squeeze with just a bunch of retards buying into GME.

Tell your friends, your family, some random hobo beggin for money in the streets to go buy GME. We need to start a movement. Just like the one that short squeezed TSLA to heavens.
+6.7k, 336%. I was down the whole year, Amazon calls saved me at the beginning of this week, 9k in one day
WSB index fund needs to be a thing. That way I can buy puts on it and finally make money for once.
When my company went public, i wasn't allowed to trade the shares until a few days after our earnings report. That's the end of the lockup period.

Usually enjoyed can trade stocks for a few days following public earnings reports. So for a multi week period 4 times per year.

When it happens for the first time after going public, it's the end of the lock up period. Make sense?
Too bad, better luck next year!

You just described most old people
That's my price target for 1/15, so I really hope they do. 30-32 close 1/31 target.  


That's assuming it continues to mimic November's crash. No guarantees, but hopefully.
I know there are some side effects first 24-48 hours but I've never heard of those specific side effects
I felt that burn. Ouch
Holding longer calls still because that’s been the plan all along.  Literally nobody said steel was blowing up in December.
Does buying puts make me a 🌈 🐻
WSB ded
It'll move sideways until there is a catalyst ... should Cohen report that he has bought shares, that'd be enough to set it off, next big bit of news is the Q4 earnings report which analysts are tipping to return GameStop to profitability.
You’re doing it wrong

Yeah but right now we're not getting anything.. still tradin em.
Lol I got more than that from my two shares of QQQ.

Sell CC of your meme stocks. This one is a meme forever. By that I mean 10% daily moves are in the cars for the foreseeable future.

Grew my account by 160% this year between my ESPP (ten percent of my pay buying my employer's stock) plus gains.. From low 20s to low 60s.  Taking out 20k today to pay off my wife's student loans.  Also getting a quarterly disbursement from my ESPP shares freeing up I'll sell covered calls on until it gets assigned.
Weeks like this TSLA haunt me. Flipping a few contracts is nice, 100% in under an hour is great but I wish I had the stones to yolo big money on 1/0DTE
Yeah for me it was. Go check bankrate/nerd wallet. No rush as they seem to still be dropping. Plus time is on your side when doing a refi. I kept emailing around this whole month having them compete against each other.

I was at +100% last week but my new baby girl STPK started shitting her fucking diaper the last 4 days. It’s okay though, she’ll blossom into a 2021 energy meme stock. 

Started at the beginning of November with $2,005. Chased NIO from $32, sold out at $46 a few weeks later. All in on STPK pre-market the morning their SPAC merge was announced.

I’ll probably get another $10k cash to fund my Robinhood in 2021 and my goal is to hit $20k profit a year from today. Gonna load up on STPK and sell covered calls. Pretty boring but hey I’m up 75% in 2 months with boring plays.
Apparently i own 100 shares of PLTR now wtf?
im not above baiting to get ahead in life. and by get ahead in life i mean get some gay emote on my comment

It's a meme the resonates with all the autist here. I second we would have a EOY MEME ranking. Vote for Meme of the year.
Up ~ 24k, started with 30k.

Goal was to get to 100k by year end.  Then september happened and i just wanted to double my money to play with.

Been taking some out slowly until its all house money

The % is wrong, robinhood glitch 🤷‍♂️

I started with about 30k however I did add capital throughout the year. I’d say about 40k of my cash has gone in

Its possible, but it probably depends on how COIVD is handled first. Chances are rolling out the vaccine and utilizing the defense production act are a higher priority than legalizing the devil's lettuce.

I'm going all in on PLTR on MONDAY with around 68k (buying shares)! I will make a post!


I intend to hold until 2030 and retire on that B)
Buy some shares pls. Calls don't trigger short squeeze.
I picked them up today. Had some cash to throw away.
Bought more shares, sold calls and deleted robinhood
Omg lol please tell me you at least got some strippers and blow at one point
Thanks for the response. I was banned for this post; sorry for being late. The weekly 230 call was a 5+ bagger from Monday morning to mid-Wednesday.

Nvm i see it. Bye bye shares. Im sad theyre leaving me, i missed out on 30 bucks of unrealized profit :( NIO 48c
PSTH kept up very well but LGVW THC B and BF T all got rekt since monday, no idea why. Probably we got pumped and dumped on by bot shills
Rolling? Or holding until expiry
Nice call comrade.

If you quit for a reason, a good reason, don't do it. You'll just end up in the same place you escaped, maybe worse, and have to start all over again.

Nobody tell my wife’s boyfriend how much I’ve lost this year.
Tell my wife’s BF that I lost tendies on the TSLA dump and I can only order from the value menu. You?
*spray paints my dick silver*
Did you miss the part where I did not go into the play? Why did you delete the text in the post? Did you not want people to see that you specifically recommended that people buy at open and sell at close?
Chief fuck all the pretty ladies officer? Okay deal

Yeah bro it’s scary . I look back and see some of the happiest days where I felt smart. And some dark days (weeks) of just losing non stop
If GME hits $50 by April I’ll offer $1k to a local charity supporting small businesses. Let’s do some good boys!
Bought 1/22 $19.5c on the 22nd and sold the 23rd for a 40% gain lol I’m just observing now

My 19 call expired last week. I took the money and ran
That was the dip before earnings--this time is different
Look at their revenue versus market cap you fool. Should be worth $5-$10 max
So. Much. Cocain. 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Yeah, it could. Setting aside any algos and bots crawling WSB, if WSB pumps as much money into it as the posts would have you believe, it'll have enough of a push to trigger the algos at institutionals, which in turn creates a sort of amplifying effect. PLTR definitely had enough hype over the month to funnel millions towards PLTR that otherwise might not have ended up there, and those extra millions triggered algo buy orders and up it goes.
i mean yeah on one hand they clearly have money to spend but they could be reasonable adults and spend it on blow instead of this shit
Better pray they release news about a new contract...
“You fucking retard! You bought puts on TSLA?! TSLA 1/31 1000c. Let’s gooooo”

Wow nice close, if you were holding a diversified basket of reasonable investment grade stocks.  Have a good new years everyone!  See-ya next year.
Price suppression so the calls don't print.
It's not about the money it's about sending a message
Congrats man you’ll prob earn big. Sadly

 Idiot!
Remember May of 2019, before covid-19 when Tesla dropped $200 a share pre-split, and it was a prolonged dip, and then the rocket boosters took it to Mars.

This time is not different. Read it and weep.

yellen makes me so honry
What are your plans after the long dick of Uncle Sam gets his piece ? ? Bask in the tendies? Spend them on hookers and blow ? Open a business ?
You’ll get it back when they start releasing shares out of the lock up. Even if things are coming back to normal it’s still way overvalued.
Shares? Ok boomer.
I got another 100 for a grand total of 300 (Avg $20.5)
Yes

Lets go boys bought the dip today, my ticket for the seat on the rocket is SECURED!  🚀🚀🚀
Fractional shares, friend. Doesn't matter how much you have, you can invest in what you want.
I still want hold until next week. And I would buy NVAX at 100
Yeah it makes me laugh. I talked to my brother about all of it on the phone randomly (he doesn’t trade) and even he was like wow why isn’t everyone just putting everything they have in it? I said “Good question, Derek, but this is Wall Street bets”.
If [u/deepfuckingvalue](https://www.reddit.com/u/deepfuckingvalue/) is still in we should be in. Just don't buy the peak.
Obviously you need to yolo that 1k on psth monthlies. Launch yourself right out of poverty.
Worst of mine thanks to WSB. Lol. Still have hope for PLTR Though. VALE and TECK May come through later next year. Got burned on some dumb monthlies early on.

A month ago I was a sophisticated trader selling covered calls on msft and apple.  Today I'm jacked to the tits all in with BB and PLTR.  My gums are bleeding and I can taste the blood.  Happy New Year
king 🙌
now that i think about it, yes, that is my slave name.
Did my part.  More GME shares and calls.
I get it free through work :/ sorry
Pour one out for the retards we've lost along the way
This has been the gayest week of life
You did well, retard.
Stock trading has a lot of similarities to gambling, except stocks trend upward and want you to win. Gambling the house is always gonna end up with your balls if you play enough. The real lesson here is don’t be a retard and yolo options unless you’re willing to lose it all.
I'm 28, I got a pair of jeans from my father and some chocolate from my mom. My 11k tiny pp account is up from an initial deposit of $8k (5% of total worth at the time) in August.

Just bought my mom some flowers and a necklace for her BDay 😎
I’m debating jumping into this cesspool of a subreddit and honestly my only reference to stocks is the GE and “merchingmils” LOL
Love catching falling knives.  Never works out but love to do it.  10  01/08 PLTR 24c  at close.

Anyone still bullish on this thing?
Your mom probably emailed some boomer that said “he should put his money into my fund”.

Dream of a green new year!
When you buy puts
PLTR was my best play of 2020. Bought shares between $10-$18 (and still holding those for the long term), and flipped calls on the first and second rocket ride. Ended up losing about 1/3 of my all my PLTR profits thinking the second rocket would keep going, but even despite that, it was my most profitable play. Dumbnuts keep buying deep OTM calls on PLTR (and really all the meme stocks) and getting burned by the rocket blast because they got suckered into paying 3x a ticket on a rocket they're already late for.
You are a prime candidate to be hired by MMs to interpret ur rationale thinking 🤔

Should i raise my 310 shares at 2.00 to 500 shares?
I'm mostly in shares and personally would suggest then.

I'd say just split the difference. VTI should be less volatile; QQQ should have more potential for growth. 

My gut tells me maybe we'll see some rotation from growth to value in the next 1-2 years. If that happens, something like VTV or VOOV might be good to have too. Or, QQQ could just keep crushing it for another few years. Who knows.
Why were SPACs so crushed?

Are my PLTR $27 calls for 1/15 gonna print?
Give ✋
LMAO
I once won like 7 50/50's in a row on some random CSGO betting site, ended up with like 3k. 

Then went for the 8th 50/50.

I'm so so so so fucked. Lost my job, unemployment benefits is 4-6 weeks out before I see any money. Down to my last $1000 to get through next month. Fuck.

Solid play since banks are cleared to buy back their own shares in the first quarter of 2021. I am loaded up on C calls.
Literally how could you have possibly managed that

If you need to be sober, do not drink that beer. 

If you don’t and it was for other reasons, have a very good beer or cocktail and enjoy it.
I wish I bought my extra shares today and not wednesday, isn't going to matter much past earning anyway, we're all going to the moon.
Yea it’s pretty insane looking back on this chart. Like a roadmap from the happiest to stressful days of the year haha
yeah it could happen b4 open too with delivery number announcement so I was sweating with 48s...I unwound everything and then got back in. I needed to take some profit anyway cuz I've been carrying a huge loss that makes me look like a degenerate to real estate ppl. luckily I don't pay fuckin taxes for A WHILE ahahhaha

Stop blaming robinhood for your shitty decisions
PLTR I assume since it went down to about that price point today.
I bought late Jan puts on SNOW, OSTK, ZM and MRNA.  Cheap and OTM. No DD whatsoever.
Yeah if he gets hold of him. Getting out of the way until the other person gets tired would be my whole premise for thinking Floyd beats an untrained 240 pound gym bro.
Are this the same analysts with a 2$ price target on NIO? Or the ones that upgraded theirs to 7$?

May just follow you with the green.. makes you feel a ton better.. problem is bars are kind of out of the question.

This chart is why trading is based upon human behavior - so many similar indications you see on every other chart out there.

I could have traded you and made money.
But its safer in a bull market and no its like $100-300 for $2200-3000 collateral week-months per csp with high IV stocks. Then compounded bc they repeat and can close positions if they are +50-75% on the premium and repeat. Then if you get assigned you just sell calls. Oh sorry is this too much information for ya smooth brain?
Lol I thought the market closed at 2pm and signed off too early

You're fucking kidding me.
Whats the point of ARKG paying a dividend if it loses 11% of market cap as a result? Poor tradeoff on an equity like that. 

Also what do you think of this PLTR trade. I am in a put credit spread with 19 and 14 strikes expiring mid february. I also am in a put debit spread with 26.5 and 26 strikes expiring January 8th. My plan is to cover losses on the credit spread weekly with the debit spreads. They are yielding 15% gains. If PLTR approaches 19 I will roll out to March and just keep buying the put spreads.

Wait we supposed to be selling today?

You can bet your ass if I went from 2k to even something like 20k, 10x return I would definitely take some profit. But with OP we're talking 115x return at his peak, and he took no profit...
I pray y’all drop the fascination with PLTR moving into 2021... imagine being obsessed with a stock that’s stuck in a 5 pt price range for the past month.
I’m sorry brother, I sold you these calls.
Fuck this shit and fuck your rewards.

Up 54% on the year.

Was a little timid over the summer and kept pulling out waiting for a second crash. Finished strong in November and December.

April-September I made 32% in diving in and out of FAANG and SPY.

October-December I made the other 22% on APPN, MGNI, SHOP, SFIX, CRWD, RDFN, PINS, ETSY. Got assraped a bit buying ZM at the top.

Going to diamond hands tech and biotech. Hopefully more moons in 2021.
It is, thank you.  Only in the past few weeks have I really wanted a drink as I got closer and closer to my goal.  Like this week I was craving a good beer like you wouldn't believe.  Unsure what I'll do.  I may wait a few days until I decided on 2021.
holy shiet, thanks op, this is actually my first time making money with options, finally up in something, 90% in my 1/22 260p. I was too scared to play weeklies because theta would have ate my ass waiting for 1/7, but man maybe I shouldve.
They went under $1b market cap 🤣

You didn't even say the day lol. It's February 14th.
Yee yeeee
Mine is a self directed 401k and the plan administrator said no to options. I am not complaining though, it is better than being stuck with only mutual fund options for my plan. I do trade options in my Roth though, that helps.
Why did you buy? I might buy myself, but how do you know it’ll move ?
Let’s go DM..... make me some money on my calls damn it!!!

So did you sell? How much you are left with?
Nope, all covered puts. Was buying at like 0.2 and selling at 0.5
Up like 120% for the year and down 15% for the week. I think my EOY OSTK and FUBO plays might fuck me into the new year tho tbh.

For those wondering when PLTR's lockup ends:


>In addition, certain record holders of Palantir’s common stock and stock options that are subject to market standoff agreements with Palantir have not signed Palantir’s lock-up agreement and are therefore not permitted to sell any shares during the lock-up period, which is expected to continue until the start of the third trading day following the date of public disclosure of Palantir’s financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020 (the “lock-up period").

No he’s a retard he belongs here
Pltr fucked the gains for my whole year. Last week I was up 30k for the year but ended down 5k because of pltr.

Pretty sure 500k 2020 deliveries are priced in. They need to hit 500k to maintain this price. Betting that IV crush will be brutal on Monday regardless of delivery numbers. FY 2021 guidance will be interesting. They probably will not announce 1M deliveries as their target, but may have 1M deliveries as their internal goal.

Let’s do it again!!!
It's amazing how many retarded plays one can make in a year and still have a home and family to come back to... im walking a fine line fellow autists
Jenkem
No idea why mods removed your post. Just hit 80% on the Jan calls that I picked up this morning.
You two don't belong here. This is a sub of humorous, but friendly banter. Remember "it's the friends we make along the way".
I started with 11k in September I now have $400 😈
That's a sign of infection lol
It doesn't. Lay off the meth-scorts.

yeah bro...with the exception of short positions anything closed today counts for 2020 taxes. some dumb motherfuckers here kept saying it was settlement date, not trade date, that matters. So they all thought dec 29th was last day. But if you sold a shitload of TSLA today, then it counts for 2020 profits. Hedge funds gotta show profits u know
GNOG is such a piece of shit
PLTR at 15 next week.
maybe
Ouch.
Awful week, down 50% on my March and October DKNG calls and shares combined. Need that ATH in January.

Got fucked by amd I'm quitting the option game
Depends on a lot of factors...  You are most likely drinking out of a box or some bottom shelf shit LOADED with sugar?
how's it hanging?
I need to learn to lock in my gains and just enjoy my day but its such a rush to FD shit. I’m not excited about holding 1/4 SPY 376 FD’s hopefully they print.
Set to make over $100k if this thing squeezes to $500
At least you lost it all in the same tax year you had the gains, right? I think we have an autist of the year award nominee right here
XL stock is like my cock... Flat and mushy for days but gets ungodly hard for 15 minutes out of no where
lol, just what you got is red
*tendy-cies
I think around 22 it finds some buyers.  In classic WSB fashion, the retards here buy after calls after a 300% run up and ask "why is it going down!?"

About 103,000 call options expired worthless on pltr today 🚀🚀🚀
Very poor here. Used my last to get a DIS 270c 5/21. Pray for me.
Well, it’s been a great year of trading lads
Okay noob
Do not ask for forgiveness boomer positions are actually smart to have
I haven't drank in 382 days- in a few hours I may have a beer.  It was a Sober 2020 for me with a few additional days in December.  If I do it's gonna taste really good.
The Trump admin has purposefully been lighting fires everywhere they could the last two years and thats also why they have delayed the recent transition. They could have lit a bomb and used the dems as a scapegoat for the next four years. All that money they gave away to friends and corps will take its toll
Now do it again with GME
Can someone tell me how this worked?  
I can never really afford TSLA so whilst price was about 705 I kept yoloing 12/31 695 puts and kept pulling out after $150 gain. I started with $100 and ended this with $1000. Is this a legit strategy every Friday. I started maybe 2 hours before close and traded all the way up until the last hour. I kinda fucked up and made a put in the last hour as I forgot about theta but apart from that made my weeks lossess back in 10 minutes
We need a bigger rocket icon. Sending multiple rockets with same fuel capacity is not helping reach the target
Literally cannot go tits up
my ass is hurting from SQ
That's what you get for paperhanding you pansy
Everything was up apparently, according to Dow, Spy and Nasdaq. Yet somehow all of my positions were slaughtered
Wdy mean 0? You still have 1K???
Peep the title

My moves tomorrow are getting fucked up from 8am to 4am and blowing through a nice chunk of the money I should be saving to pay taxes
Always can buy more
Just bought some monthlies at close. Can only go up from here?
Oh that was me
never get too attached to one stock, example: PLTR, stuck with it hoping it will fly again only to see it tank while missing out on other mooning opportunities.
Sold my SE two day swings at almost the top today. I have to get in the habit of locking in big profits more often. 

The buying into the close overall was tremendous. Holding NVDA and AMZN 1/15 calls into new year 😬
You are a great trader
[deleted]
Things got a bit wild today and I went well over the number of trades to make me a Patter Day Trader...

I still have one final position I’m trying to exit and will do so on Monday. 

Any idea if I will be able to exit my final position (SPY Puts) on Monday?

Also, the puts expire on Monday, how late in the day do I have until Robinhood automatically exits my position as I don’t have enough capital to buy the outs if they’re in the money.

People the expert analysts already told everyone that this year was going to be an above average bull year, maybe not as crazy as this year but damn close. Anyone who expected a crash honestly idk what to say I just can’t understand how any bear could be that retarded. We all saw the December downhill correction and sell off week coming but it’s over now. Money is pouring back in the market next week and people are taking positions. If you didn’t buy the dips this week then you really really fucked up big time
GME 50 x $23 1/8... bought at peak where my 🚀🚀🚀 at
Find the penis
Industrials and Banks are gonna make a comeback
No one had puts cause gay bears just talk shit without the balls to open positions.
Fuck me sideways. I just tried to sell 18 contracts for 250 each when they were valued at 150 each just before close. I accidently bought 18 contracts at that amount.

Now I'm down 30% all time because of that. Fuck fuck fuckkk
Bought $BIGC at $64.10. Cutting losses at $60.
Wait, there doesn’t seem to be support until $20-21, and even then if it can’t hold at this price we can likely see a dip as low as $17. If it was me I would jump in at $21. If you plan on holding this stock for years then it doesn’t really matter too much jump in now whatever, but short term I would wait
how did you go from 2k to 100k?
I sure hope they are not like Pied Piper from season 3.
this is the way
Its A M C 😂
Usually happens on sunday champ
already fucked around & lost money. never again. I prefer my manipulated stocks to be *MURICAN* dammit
Thank you all for showing me the way. Before wsb, I was a poor retard. Now I'm $8K richer, but still a retard.
Nice
its gotta be above 23.89 at some point right?? :'(
Depending on the platform though. Robinhood doesn't allow it I guess
Buy more next week. Lots more room to fall when extra shares actually hit the market next Thursday. Gonna be a bloodbath, my [puts](https://ibb.co/bQyBpLK) can't wait.
my boomer etfs (my core) was up
It's on sale
PLTR has potential but right now is nothing but a pump and dump stock.
Staying strong! Picked up some more shares on the dip. Here’s to a crazy 2021 🚀🚀🚀
😄💪
Jacked to the tits on SQ and DOCU calls. Happy New Year bitchez.
Two 289,130 share lots of GME were bought at 1:00:02 today! Thats about 11 million USD in GME...

&#x200B;

IS COHEN COMING IN STRONGER!?!?! I BOUGHT MORE AT 18.9 TODAY LETS ROCEKT ON MONDAY AND SQUEEEEZE
Maybe the person that bought the calls does not have enough cash to exercise —> Your call still expires worthless and you get free premium lmao

Idk I’ve never been assigned yet 🤷🏾‍♂️
Some fuckery afoot.
My balance lol. There was an error in the app and showed me up “53,000%” which isn’t true. So i tagged it as a meme post then I got shit on lol
I’ve actually worked with people that legit didn’t want a raise because they thought their entire paycheck would be taxed at the higher rate.

Now that I’m in management I would legit send people to remedial training if I heard someone say this.
Everything im holding dumped HARD at close, fuck.
Don't worry they'll come for you

That's a pretty terrible New Year's Resolution
Was interesting seeing SPY 1/4 put prices generally go up even as it was shooting up.
2020 was the beginning of the big tech oligarchy. Hope you retards with QQQ and AMZN calls are happy. 

Also happy New Years !!! 🥳
GME 🤡🤡🤡
I was dropped as a baby. Repeatedly.
Funny thing is I have been here for years and my account is up 200% and this is where I do all my due diligence. The funny part is I don't even know what FD means
Is it okay to get drunk now?
If I had the money I would 100% play the wheel on SE. You could sell ATM puts/calls on the days where it randomly decided to pump/dump like crazy and sleep safely knowing it will inevitably rebound back to a more reasonable number (in either direction)
If you buy at $12 and then buy more at $10 you will own 120% of the outstanding stock
At any of those pull out points, he would have ended the year with more than he has now.
Who knows. We'll see.
How is SPY pumping when everything is red?

It's 100% not a YOLO play, it's for sure a value play. I'll never do a YOLO play those honestly. Making money isn't about massive percentage gains, it's not losing money. 
I definitely gamble but not with my entire portfolio as coming back from a massive lost is very difficult IMO
Bought 1/4 375 spy calls at 2:50. Sold too early at 3:30. Left a ton on the table but thankful for profits. Have a happy new year everyone

thanks man. Got royally fucked by Express, bought ARKK near top, slow burned by Salesforce, and bought BIGC on dip which is now near 52-week low. Happy new year
Bought 3 call debit spreads on ENPH for Feb.  Hoping to get a run up before S&P and then sell.  If it doesn't run up then that's why i got the extra month.
bought in a lil too early today, but still expecting a good monday and tuesday.
Until you sell it to watch it keep going up
85k profit! My first year trading too. Can’t complain
I hate my self and my life, next year im gonna make it better

I told you not to get caught holding greed. These are volatile stocks you have to pull out when it runs too much. I made thousands on all of them except pltr. I don't know how or why that bottom broke but it did. 3/4 is one damn good recommendation in my book. The case for CRM still baffles me to this day. Its been trading sideways for a month. I entered a Feb 19  270c position after a premium options alert i received, theyve been wrong so far.

I would expect a bounce higher after lockup expires depending what happens with GA elections next week. Probably goes sides ways a bit after this lockup, if not up until the massive March unlock of 300M shares then I would think another leg down. I will probably be out prior to their next earnings call and then get back in puts.
ouch man, been there for sure
gratz bro. 
I am holding XPEV and SBE that I intend to maintian my position in for a decade. I will buy my first Electric car with my EV gains. That or they will become worthless. I prefer gains but idgaf really either way.

You mean you set a limit then chased a few times until you put in a market order just to get bent over?
My calls i sold just expired itm yet i still see them in my list and i still own the shares, wtf?

Yo listen up, here's the story
About a little guy that lives in a red world,

And everything he sees is just red

Red his house with a red little window,
And a red Corvette,
And everything is red for him,
And himself and everybody around,
'Cause he ain't got nobody to listen. 

I'm in the Red, da ba dee da ba daa
Woah MSFT, that’s some epic end of year pumping.
I can find it on the phone but i'm an idiot and cannot find it on the web.
Copped 400 shares of PLTR just now
That term is quite loose and way overused these days. It’s like saying you a photographer
PLTR 30 at Monday means it has to make a 30% move up. Its definitely in the realm of possibilities.
SPY 376 at open on Monday? 🙏
What kind of retarded math
Even spring is being impatient. Pltr will be a fucking Goliath of a company in the next 2-4 years. Shares and leaps are the only play now IMO. People need to stop trading it and playing with FD’s. Those of us with shares and long dated calls, and half a brain, aren’t worried.
Old Rasputin, a classic 🍻
Something is going down with GILD. Christ I hope it’s real and not another pump and dump.
How come nothing I owned participated in that EOD pump? How the fuck were the indices all green?

Wait today was a Green Day? Didn’t feel like it
Bought MRNA huge dip. Should go back to $140 minimum, perhaps $160 short term and long term who knows. I’m targeting $120, $140 then $160 over couple month period.
How the fuck was that a green day for every index
I wanna know what it tastes like
Missed it by 10 seconds :(
Remember kids the money you gamble with in robinhood is very real and can have consequences don't use margin unless you've been doing this for couple years.
Every share counts. Keep in mind they have less than 70m shares. This company isn’t very big. Only about 22m or so of them trade on the open market. Every share you can take off the market matters. There is 1.7m of us on here lol imagine if we all bought like 10 shares. Some of us are holding thousands if not tens of thousands. Make the shorts struggle to borrow more shares.
How does that work?  You had cash covered puts?
Commenting now so I get all the upvotes and gay medals
Diamond handing my May Calls!
I'm confused. Wether a squeeze happens or not, shorts covering will drive up the price unnaturally. If you read the DD, I talk about how its likely there wont be a massive squeeze like people suggest unless/until there are no sellers left, and we will probably see a gradual price increase over the current months. However, since shorts are 250% of available float, the probability of there being some type of squeeze is higher than not

It's all good. 'otm' stands for 'out of the money' or I guess 'out the money'.

Which, in this context means GME, for example, stock price is currently at 18.9x.  If I own 100 shares, I can sell *covered* calls with a strike price far otm like $30 to collect a little premium - not much but something > nothing. 

If I did **not** own 100 shares, I would be selling *naked* calls.

EDIT: if you don't know what you're doing just stick to buying options for now - you can royally, and I mean royally, fuck yourself selling options, *especially* selling calls.
It wasn’t funny the first time it was posted either mate
Need that end of day momentum to carry over to monday
It was drill team 6 with a 🚀 on their backs.
Damn. Feels like 2021 in here.
My cock is limp now. Thought about buying calls on GS like a month or two ago but didn't pull the trigger :'(
Imagine being down 1% today. Fuck ARK.
We should have a pandemic every year if it’s going to be like this
Nice, all my SPY put orders hit on that last green dildo. Can't wait to get bull fucked in the new year.
Bought BFT on the dip. Better give me tendies next year.
I would be highly surprised if the guy who’s been  influential in every policy decision for the past 40 years is going to actually change things now. Just my suspicion.
Theta gang just got fucked
Bought far otm tsla calls at close lets go 🚀
Derpcules?

What you idiots think about a lil PLAY action? Back to normal back to normal back to normal
Hopefully I’m passed out til noon tomorrow
You date my grandma bro
I saw the same thing, it just started popping off. Sold a covered call right before close.
I’ll look it up. And I hope you’re right. Thank you.
And that's a wrap for 2020

MT needs to fly again
Fuck you.  And congrats.
I instantly now feel better about my measly losses. Holy shit.

Thank you for your sacrifice!
You be kind to Cathie. Ark has worked over time this year. It needs a sec to take a breather.
dump it and wsb will go down in anarchy
Not a good week. Good year though. Cheers 🥂

Few months ago people were saying spy would go to 3400 and nobody believed them. This is insane year makes no sense. Nasdaq up 42 percent for the year total lol.
Did I buy the crisper top
anyone holding spy calls over the weekend?
Its a pos bro just bail
And thats a cap on 2020

What a fucking year. Best year of my life trading thanks to WSB
Also wishing I bought more SNOW 270p 1/8
Just more diamond hands, of course.
I honestly believe that FROG will be one of the best performing stonks in 2021. I also think AZN basically can't go lower unless their is a market wide crash. 

Accordingly, I've started a gang, the asian frog gang

 👲🐸  = AZN + FROG
ATH EOD EOW EOM EOQ EOY 🥳🥳
I closed out ~10 minutes ago as it broke $281. 

Guessing it will probably bleed a bit until the next lockup expiration, a bit of a bump back up.  Will probably buy more puts in anticipation of the March lockup.  

Thats gonna be a bloodbath.
Started in late February and had absolutely no clue what I was doing

Thanks everybody for making this year enjoyable
TSLA 700 pretty neat!

\-boomer
Up 62% on the year. Thanks RUN AMD VSLR AAPL LSCC SABR. Can't forget some lucky GPRO calls. Almost lost it all trying to get to VALEhalla. Next year VRT and SABR will take me to the promised land. I also bought PTON at 32 and sold at 27. I'm not smart.

Elon was nice to me today
How in the fuck was the DOW up nearly 200 points?
Fat fingered a market order instead of limit and got filled at my buy price when it could have been a small profit 🤬
Every day Novavax P3 Results don't come out is good news for NVAX. (means events are only happening in the placebo arm). 70% of the new infections in the UK are the new COVID variant. Novavax will be the only company with a P3 trial conducted with the new variant. NVAX is 1/6 the value of MRNA...  so much room to grow.

All the retards thought the market closed early today.
Fake story...BAN
PSA: Market is closed tomorrow.  Hope you bought all the PLTR shares you could before we rocket up next year.
Umm i didnt buy in just got tired of the spam like pltr
$24 1300 shares
they absolutely murdered airlines in those last 20 minutes wtf
small jump at eod, feel slightly better now
😬
That fucking sucked for me but I know a bunch of you made money after 2pm.

Glad December is fucking over

See you all Monday bright and early

**pleasure doing business with y’all**

see you in 2021, brothers in arms
PLTR is such a dogshit company that I had to panic buy back the monthly puts I wrote for fear of assignment
My GME 20 calls expired worthless because of short that never came...

Aren't markets closed tomorrow?
What we drinkin 🍻
Yes
my moves tomorrow is to fucking NOT wake up at market hours seeing my FDs going to the shitter.

so it'll be a decent day.
I don't know why people keep saying this. Most of us are retail idiots who don't understand the basics and we're up against computers that are designed to buy low and sell hi. That's not manipulation, it's going one-on-one against Jordan in his prime.
That was some exhilarating EOD trading.  I haven't been in that kind of zone in a whole week.. Let's Go!
Fucking green day and I'm blood red !!
How though
They’re sensitive about their favorite stock that’s being dumped
How many retards lost money on 12/31 TSLA puts?

It expires today. Don’t know when insiders are actually going to start selling but lockup expired today
I really wanted to buy a SPY put really bad at the end, but I didn't free up enough cash to buy one in time. Sigh...
Imagine thinking we learn lmao
That's not how this works?
Holy shit....live like a champion, die like a champion. Respect the dedication to the YOLO fam
My portfolio did NOT reflect dow/spy/nasdaq being green 🤡
so the GS buyback thing is real huh? damn wish I bought more on those calls....
Happens every Dec 31st in the last hour
#FIRST
You fought the good fight. Now rest retard.
SPY calls already up 50% in 5 min. Monday is going to be fucking amazing
See ya 2020!
FUCK PLTR
This retard for sure held.
Closed at 2.7 so like 12% loss for this dumbass as of now. Eat shit dumbass
Anyone buy spy puts at close too?
Position and expectations? Not feeling optimistic with Jan 15 calls but already down so much just have to diamond hands.
CHINA AND BABA RUINED NYE
[removed]
People are too impatient with it, just need to sit around until spring at the earliest and something will pop. I said when I bought a fuck ton of shares I would close my eyes on it for a year at least. That's what I'm doing.
Placing calls on my hangover and puts on my bottle of Krug.
u wanna gimme monies for xbox
Final moves of 2020. Added some more BB shares on the dip. Got leaps for next year and 2023. 

Easy play. Next year you are gonna see the potential.
BUY THE DIP
Bought 4 SPY 1/21 390's a few hours ago for .89, sold for 1.25. Feels good to end my 96% loss year on a slightly high note. Now to figure out how to turn 558.18 of buying power in to 16 grand so I can recoup my losses and never enter this stupid fucking casino again.
One thing to make GME higher, is tap into the PC world. Sure they might sell some accessories, but need to make it competitive enough like amazon etch.
Looks like we’re going to get another “rotation” out of tech....
Yup me too
mods are drunk
My meme game is weak. I count on you seasoned veterans.
PSTH wierd movement last 30 min
Damn tons of volume at the end on SQ
Ark you bitch
Ok 82% gain this year.
Hopped in mnxxf thanks for the heads up
Happy new year degenerates
Ended .7% down. Fake and gay
So for all the bears that got fekked this year you guys get to start fresh in Jan. Come join Bull Gang.
This happens far more often than not when people win big initially; most degenerate gamblers just don't post the losses
fr that last ten seconds literally cost me 75 bucks
I think the target is 96.56.  That was the closing high back in July 2000.
Found this place in February, +$3,128 on the year. Not worth.
Congrats to the winners today.  Happy New Year's tards!
🤚✋
[removed]
Thank god for that one position that keeps you green
What a pussy
Feels good to buy calls at a low ask, and instantly get 5% profit because some fucktard didn’t do a limit buy

Lockup ends today man
Deep fucking platinums.

-20%, -20%, +9%, -5%...

It was a good week for me
It's like I actively hate money
I’m very stupid in real life so being up 52% in my first year of trading (started in Sept.) makes me pretty happy.
Fuck you.
Daily Reminder I got approved for options and traded my first FD on September 2nd 😎
Scalped some $705c TSLA for $500 profit in the last 30 minutes of trading.

Now that 2020 is behind us, I guess you can say hindsight is 2020

You're  like Harry Potter's retarded son
See you next year retards. 🇺🇸

-5% today, best day in weeks
FUCK YOU 2020!!!
That was a really gay day

For a completely blind gamble it went pretty well. I probably should have held but I went into it expecting maybe .22 or .24 at close, and I always lose my ass trying to double or nothing lmao

Dumb luck, should've bought more.

So Spy only went up 16% this year ? So what was the fuss about?
Can someone logically explain why PLTR is doing this while SPY does that ? What
What an ending! Wow 2020 was fun. Cheers to another year with the boys
WHAT WITH WHO?????
Yes sir .

If there is a bounce after the Jan lockup endings I am getting some apr puts also.
Who else is red after an objectively good day in the market 🤡🤡🤡
This stresses me out beyond belief
Damn I almost feel bad except that I don't at all.
Thank god I sold my puts
gg’s boys, this year will go down in history
Idk. SP dropped from 429 to 350 around the mid December lockup lift. Seems to be behaving in similar fashion now. Can’t imagine how March is going to shake out.
Why was volume so low today?
Beyond absolutely, definitively and unarguably THE weirdest day of the entire year.   


Bar none.   


Happy New Year.
I am in an abusive relationship with TDOC but I know that things are going to get better

#LAST STOCK GUH OF 2020:

#GUH
Whew. This is more addicting than sex or booze. Was up to 57k on my TSLA FD’s fucking held until I was red for the day at 30k, rebought and went down to 26k bought 1/4 SPY 376 calls and back up to 45k
DING DING MOTHAFUCKAS
Yes please sell Tards, I'll buy more!
2021 is gonna be green as fuck.
I promise if I can actually get some tendies I’ll donate. Pls bless me tendie gods
We all knew it would end like this but its still surprising
Look at that VIX. Looks an opportunity
TSLA ending the year with ATH smashing all records. Quite fitting.
the higher the indices go up the more i lose, and i am not a bear
And thats a fucking year.

Holy shit what a close with Apple
Alright, that's that, next year will be PLTR's year, that or I'm going to be very upset.
This is a Wendy's
pencil down, retard
I don't have the capital to make any difference, I hope some of us aren't broke and can actually buy shares and pump
HAPPY NEW YEARRR
Bought the PLTR dip
Just bought APHA leaps
the amount of dicks i need to suck to recover even 25%.... holy shit
Seeking Alpha with a PLTR slow pump right before the weekend so assholes can stew on it
That’s what’s up bro. Remember, it only took 2k. That’s a few pay checks at minimum wage. In America, you have the opportunity to work at Wendy’s. Which also means, you’ll always be a few 10 baggers away from millions.

Try again next year lol!
PENCILS DOWN
Rotation to sports betting
If u ever wondered, ‘Hmm, I wonder if this market is manipulated at all?’ 😂
A lot more action the last 2 minutes on GME
30k is rich?
Wait as soon as I cut my losses, PLTR will 🚀🚀 to $35 in the next two weeks and save millions! You’re welcome WSB retards!
2020. Best year ever.
Weeeee time to use my tax losses this year for gains next year!! I think I've beat the system guys
I am convinced that doing the dumbest thing at any moment is the call.  If everyone is smart and expecting something to happen, theyve already moved the market
Lol I got none of this pump
Went with 370p 1/11🤡

i think i shouldve bought more shares, eh, whatevs
I'm nowhere near as bad, 200 shares at 26
He’s right though
I thought lockup ended 3 days after q4 results?
Welp, that's it boys and girls. Here's to hoping for a green Monday!
i sold my spy calls before the huge rip bc it was dipping :(
Bruh why did SPY decide to spike after I sell my 12/31C for a 40% loss and now it would have got me 100% gain 🤡🤡😔
Thoughts on wheeling QQQJ instead? Arguably more frothy companies in there.

I dream of the day i can make $1 a month of dividends.
why would people sell or the lockup when it's still a few months out?
you are who i aspire to be
Damn skillz
SAVE taking a dive. double check if youre red and need to sell before close
Yes, atleast have the guts to keep your post up instead of deleting when your reads go sideways or down.
bought it today
Congrats. SPY calls through weekend is always a good bet.
So much wasted money this year...yikes
NIO stay below 49 or I will kick ALL of China's ASS

“Why GME red? Dog food guy said they become E-commerce business 🥺”
The great thing about it is how chewy was so great, because of their excellent customer service and forging deep loyalty within the buyers.

This year I've mastered the skill of buy high sell low
Damn this hits home.

You still got more money than me
PLTR volume is low today. Hope it gaps up Monday!
Is that what we’re calling a gambling addiction now?
Went a total of -76.98% this year in the biggest bull run of a market. Must have mixed up the spelling of trader for retard
Fuck you MM you aint my real dad
FUCK ME of course SKLZ goes fucking parabolic once I sold that shitty fucking stock
Yes but things are different when king Meme stonk TSLA heads to 710. Also its not like some of them won't recover if they have good fundamentals
Get into TSLA calls EOD? 🤔
Guys there is 0 manipulation in the market
SPY WTF
I'm still going to make a profit in every scenario except +5% or more over the next few weeks. It's not bullish it's cautious.
I declare bankruptcy!
GILD is making me tendies!!!
Apparently I'll be assigned to buying 2,000 shares of PLTR at $27.50 today. 

My butthole hurts.
Shit was bouncing around like crazy.
So I guess a ton of people are either locking in apple gains or losses right now. Getting whiplash watching the chart
You certainly belong here. Godspeed retard
Better yet: sell covered calls instead of buying FDs

Last month people were like yeah maaan sell your AAPL shares for PLTR. AAPL hasn't done shit in 3 months PLTR gonna be mooning. Then as soon as I sell AAPL it goes up 20$ and PLTR is kicking the dirt leaving me bagholding 🤡
“How much of this is driven by what you’ve called a “new breed of day trader?”

“It’s been a big force, and in some ways it’s been a positive in terms of driving those initial gains, especially with the surge in individuals buying call options. When that happens, the market makers have to buy the underlying stock to hedge their own positions, and that sets things in motion. It’s almost like the retail investor and the institution change places between cart and horse: The retail investor became the horse and was sort of pulling institutional investors. What we don’t know is whether this new cohort will represent the typical individual-investor sentiment extremes, and panic sell.”

Every time I make a trade, i stop for a second and ask "would a stupid person do this?"  And if the answer is yes, I tell him to shut the hell up and i do it anyway.
Noob question, what does otm mean?
Pltr party over. But at least I have March calls...
No way spy is green on momday
CNBC says 120% of GME shares are owned by institutional investors? Can somebody please explain this to me? Can they short the same share more than once? 🤷‍♂️
God bless America, I guess
every single day of the last 1.5 weeks, the indexes were green while my portfolio bled profusely. 

Maybe money hates me.
I’m glad you guys enjoy it!

Yup electrification as a service will be huge in the near future, everything is moving green specially now that Democrats are in the White House and further more if the senate is flipped considering the close race coming up in GA. UPS, FedEx, DHL Walmart, the customer base is massive.
You proved my point retard. “SaVInG mY BiRtHDAy aND baR MiTZVa MoNeY”.
You are very welcome! Absolutely zero resistance today. In free fall on good volume. Next week will be even better. I suspect $250.
I love that only this sub would collectively waste REAL MONEY (~367 shares worth of GME atm) on internet points just because we have nothing better to do. Might as well make Reddit history and beat the [most expensive post](https://www.reddit.com/user/award-cost-bot/comments/euxitc/highest_priced_submissions/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) while we’re at it 😂

EDIT: WTF WE MADE HISTORY

EDIT 2: Stop wasting money (but also thanks for the platinum lmao!)

Oh noooo dude! That sucks, yeah it was only like a 20 min window but damn rip, you called it too
GOODBYE 2020!!!!
Diversification just gives you more stocks to lose in. Putting all your eggs in 1 basket takes your 90% loss rate from buying 10 stocks down to 50% only buying 1 stock.  
Tell this lady to chill out, her son did the maths.

already pumping back up
lol Fridays are the days to always buy some stupid OTM SPY calls for 0.01 and sell the rip. I made 500%... on a whooopppiinnngggg $10 lol
NO HERETIC
Happy NYE brothaaaa!!!!!!
Bought 01/04 376c for 0.13, just sold for 0.68. Best return I've had in a day trade in a while.

And that’s why it’s time to buy calls ladies and gentlemen
MRNA is an odd one tbh... not sure why it’s been plowing so hard.

Up 56k was up 225k at one point this year but got too greedy and got rekt. Tesla amazon shares and calls mostly.

Apple pulling a Tesla Quadruple Witching right now what the fuck
At this point PLTR needs a billion dollar contract just for me to break even.
Same. I bought into 376 as well sold half for 50% profit and holding the rest through the weekend good luck to us both.

I'm riding this into the craters of hell, 40k @ 18.98!
Kinda thought they'd open higher Sunday instead
Op thank you for the dd post. Up over 100% hope next week is just as good. You bought my family Christmas this year.
Idk, but this algos are definitely not buying my stonks.
Well Palantir
If you think $PLTR is drilling now, just wait for the lockup period selling next week 😬
Some retard just gave my leaderboard post on my profile 5 Ternions... That's equivalent to about $500 worth of awards...

So if I went -85% in 2020 am I retard

Being in Lumbridge, I can tell you that is false.

holy shit Tim Apple

Mhm yea got no idea what that is. 

:Adds more calls opening day Monday 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
r u sure? PLTR IS DRILLING HERE
Account just jumped 11k boys. Kombiya moth ducks it’s a new year
You good bro?
Fucking hell what is going on with Apple LMAO
Happy new year and see you in 2021 you amiable degenerates.
Good bye 2020
I actually hear this shit unironically from a friend at work. "I wonder how much taxes those robinhood traders are going to have to pay this year" like who the fuck cares if you have to pay 35% taxes if you flip 1K to 100K lol thats still 1K to 65K my guy
April I think is doable for $30. You have the holiday sales and ICR conference in January then Q4 earnings in March which will contain console revenue. Should be strong. Calls though I feel like is risky just because there’s no telling what tricks the shorts will try to push it down. That’s why shares are the way to go. Buy them in a cash account and take the shares out of the float, less for them to borrow and harder for them to push it down.
I’m surprised anyone is still a bear in this market, bull market has years left in it
Today is a sad way to end the year for meme stocks
+66%, made some dumb decisions on Ackman "hell" day. But made up for it in the end.

Bullish close!!!
its still 2020 what do you expect?
But.. time decay. No thanks. Shares it is, and sell the calls to people who don't understand Theta and IV. Been working since July :)
running up before earnings on  01/19/2021.
Never again, I’ve been burned by PLTR one too many times
Hook me up. I’ll pay $2k for new bottle
Fuck yes. 380 1/15 calls baby!!
At 2 pm today somebody strapped rocket engines on SPYs back. It went from 371.5$ to 374. If you bought 374c at 2pm you are looking at a 10 bagger.
Just time I’m afraid. I think January it starts to run. I’ve got a bad feeling about the share lock up though.
I’m having a major autistic episode. I keep buying SNOW shares because it makes no sense to me that it keeps going down. There’s no way this dip isn’t gonna be bought up. The institutional investors whose lock up period is expiring next week are not all just gonna dump their shares on first opportunity. SNOW has huge potential short term and long term
If you didn’t load up on apple and amzn you will regret it next week!

True, but the trend the world is on is more power concentration and more surveillance. See WEF, digital central bank currencies, etc. Lots of growth opportunities.
Today was such a motherfucker. Could’ve cashed out for huge gains in the early afternoon but didn’t. Everything fucking crashed and then TD sold my options right before Tesla started to recover. Happy new year!

Holy shit, you made me realise I'm a 6", 240lbs dad... Time for some lifestyle changes in 2021 I guess. Starting with buying options, of course
Pleas ban this bitch
Yea I’m down nearly that much in just lkke 6 months, trick I think is not trying to get it all back next year and you will eventually do ok.  Just add to it when you can, sell covered calls and puts once you get a few k more
Huge IV spike on Apple, damn

Anyone  betting on SPY through the new year?
Goodbye 2020, you’ll be missed. There is probably not going to be another year where we make money so easily

Good luck man. Hopefully you learned from your failures. Took me playing the market for more than 6 years before I started to really make money.
This sub has gotten lazy. "Do ur own dd" used to be the theme. I could give a shit if you take a position. The post is plenty. Cuck on the sideline brah, it's fine, but don't ask me to do more work so you can make money. Half the 'dd' on the site is fucking retard TA to begin with. I already let you know that they're gonna blow out earnings. I can't satisfy all you retards! 

I'd rather you tell me I'm wrong with your own fucking opinion than this mindless 'give me more' horse shit. 

Nut up and educate urself. No one will make you rich except for yourself. Figure it out.

You were wrong about GME and PLTR (and how!). NIO looking not so good too. Before you deleted it, you said buy at beginning, sell at EOD. Keep the post up, so that people can judge the next time you make such a post. You were wrong about CRM too, EOY is not 245 but 221. Either you are selling people these calls, or you suck at magic crayons.
So much death. What can men do against such reckless hate ?
Fucking boomer stock $T must have taken a little blue pill. Haven't seen a rise like this in weeks!
They just wanted to close us at ATH spy wow
I’m showing good restraint by not getting in on these meme dumps right now. PLTR and gme look rip though. I have no long term faith but some short term profit could be had.

Stay safe and see y'all in 2021.
No I agree with you. I'm actually Democrat but I know how much the Trump administration has been propping up the market artificially. We need a correction and I think it would be good for the market. This run in the middle of the pandemic since May has been insane. The further up we go the harder the Fall is going to be.

Held nio through -40 losses I am not selling until they are 200+ gains currently at -6
Why did $T just boing? I have calls
Buy the FVRR, JMIA, and LMND dips, it’s free money!
PLTR bulls straight delusional at this point
$50C 2/21 and 130 shares (also not a baller)
That’s because they’ve closed a lot of stores already this year. If they were making that many sales then why close hundreds of stores?
I just hold tons of shares

Think best decision I made this month was to move out of options..Just chilling with boomer shares and warrants.
It’s just one week
I came for the comments, and I was not fucking dissapointed...
At least you had the brains to offset those gains in the same year. Kinda genius actually. Not letting the feds steal any of your gains

Use IB for CFDs, follows the underlying exactly, no spread on top. Can still buy em where I’m looking

I think after ER this will bounce back, even if it drops I will hold . This might run up before ER also, currently most of the retail stocks are down today.  Just couple more days for ER.
Psth like icarus today. Flew a bit to high
I’m down that today. Smells like broke in here
As we enter this new year, let us say a prayer 

May our hands grow stronger 

May greed not corrupt our plays and harm our gains

May Delta always be on our side 

And may SPY hit $400 AMEN

Just bought more PLTR calls, since I’m not a bitch 🚀🚀🚀
Good luck. 4% gain should be a nice cash cushion for any potential losses
sold my calls for a $60 loss today (whatever) but the peace of mind I have now from only holding shares is fucking wild

38 shares at an average of $19.11, got in at $17.90 pre earnings and sold the news before the call but should’ve jumped back in immediately 😔
No idea what you're talking about, as usual.
Nobody knows, but it's provocative
Better luck next year, pussy.
why...pltr news has been non existent
I just bought GHlV 2/19/21 $12.5c (x4) for $2.80 average cost per- off of some recommendations I’ve seen here in the sub. 

You guys think it’s a decent buy?

How about instead of all you fucks complaining about Pltr dropping.... try buying the dip? I’ve been doing it everyday for a month now. It’s failed tremendously but ohhh when it pays off watch out.
Went from 3k to 30k to 5k this year, all thanks to Baba

> Ford says the Mach-E can provide up to 300 miles of driving range. 

The roadster has 620 miles of range. It's not even close. As for a more similar vehicle, the Model X long range has 370 miles of range. Tesla has better battery tech right now. And of course, you have to account for the fact that the only car company with any real charging infrastructure is Tesla, so range matters less for them than their competitors. This will be the case for at least the next few years. Traditional auto makers won't have a supercharger network equivalent for at least three years, and during that time Tesla will keep increasing their market share.
Lol psth bleed off most of today’s gains

my boomer stocks are the only green in my portfolio: EQIX, IBM, GS, JNJ, LDOS, MET, MRK, NDAQ, NOW, O, PM, QCOM  - all green. And TSLA.
Here we go to $50 people better get on now.
Sure but it ran over 400% since the March crash. Possibly going down to fill a gap at 326.
They are still alive because they are making sales and they have millions in cash at hand.

Trading212 is not allowing any long position on GME to be opened on their CFD (europoor leveraged stonks basically) platform anymore. They also have increased margin requirements of 50% rather than 20% for GME. They see it moving up.
You've convinced me.  Gonna be a long hauler as well.

Can't stop making money, please send help. Something is seriously wrong
It’s because they’ve closed hundreds of stores. They’re only doing better because of Covid and new generations of consoles. Amazon and Best Buy will kill them off eventually. I’m not even sure how they’re still alive. But if you want to listen to this sub then no one is stopping you.

Either I make money eventually, or the company dies.  Averaged down and all in.  Don't invest what you can't afford to lose. 

This is the way.
why not?
I have a couple april 16 calls, but I bought them for gambling purposes so my strategy is to watch them and sell when I feel like it lol. This really isnt an options play though

Higher call volume for the ones that expire today. Large volume above $ 23.
Can anyone post that they are down more than $3500 today to make me feel good... 6k on the week
GME Gang....DIAMOND HANDS ENGAGE

It’s when the dividends paid out by your stocks are automatically put towards buying more shares, therefore increasing later yields. A very simple buy and hold way of taking advantage of compounding returns.

for trying to help?
Well today was underwhelming
Dude i was busy on the pump... and missed it too... I’m so mad.  Lost half my investment
Had only 3k to my name in February. By early April i had 23k all on travel puts. like a retard i didn’t only double down, i tripled down. Was back at 3k by the end of april and took me months to stomach. I could had paid off my student loans and bought a decent car.

Now i just have a rusty old truck. And a boring office job. I’ve learned a lot this year and certainly improved my trading habits. Currently up $600 on options trading. Personal account with shares only is up $1500
It will be a lot of money jumping back in
PLTR being a dick today
XL at $30 end of January
What a shit day and I have no more money to buy these dips.

Lost the chance to blow it on blow and tender strippers. Good job

Good luck

I said semiconductors and chinese ev. WDC makes hard drives and is a low volume stock
Don’t be racist now
Yeah it does seem to be a downward trend to fall down some more with some peaks here and there. It'll probably still be ok until summer 21. Maybe into spring/winter but by then alot of people will be vaccinated..
Depends on the coins he held. Most of them are dead.
Just bought into PLTR to sell covered calls to you degenerates. 

May the stock moon and we both make gains off it 😇
Happy New Year to the Fucking Retarded Queer
Don't forget GME!

So we’re expecting a rise for next month?
Yeah, you scrubs should have bought 1000 shares at IPO like I did. Now I’m getting dragged because you all want to play craps with the stock market. Damn youuuuuu!!

Where did I show any hate
Buy JMIA calls if you want to wake up rich on Monday
I think he might be soon, he’s just recently been verified on Twitter which could indicate he’s about to take his social media presence more seriously. Plus he’s been tweeting emojis and weird stuff like the Ben Franklin pic

I wanna say Monday will be green but this close does not inspire me
It was posted 10:52am. This means GME will be $100 by October 52nd if I'm reading this correctly.

You should make a proper post and poll asking this!

Bought a 100 shares more. Like the current stock price. This diamond's hands are NOT selling!
What strike and date for calls please
People are comparing this to the dot com bubble where stonks went crazy and that wasn't even too long ago. We will probably see this happen 1-2 more times in our life. Recessions or depressions are also cyclical look at the history

I opened up a NIO 47.5/48 Debit spread expiring next Friday it keeps fluctuating going from negative return to a positive return to no return since I bought it this morning. NIO hasn’t dipped below 48 yet today. Is this normal I’ve done a lot of research on spreads and this is my first execution so I’m a bit new still. From my understanding as long as it expires above the $48 strike price next Friday I make the full profit so when should i start to see a positive return,  thanks for you guys help
over today, under next week
Thanks for all of this. I think your strategy sounds pretty good if we're playing GME with shares and I'll probably adopt a similar strategy. I imagine the autists with calls are playing a much different game?
just keep buying dont let them win
Palantir is ass
meme energy. 

at the very least I don't see why it can't run up to a 100B market cap.
Get this man his sauce
GME long term hold?🤪
Hmmm tempting, but I'ma go with ARKG calls
[deleted]
Every earnings I played, it beat huge, it’ll tank. It misses insanely and it runs up 20%. Shit company, driven by memes and nerds
same same bought few hundo more shares
If this dude had stopped at 10k, 20k, etc he'd have more money than he has now. Even without hindsight you can call luck for what it is
cathy bought some... she always knows something...
IWM puts 20% OTM to hedge going into the weekend.
You make me feel better about buying pltr again at 33
Fidelity work?
VIX got a little chub for power hour
I just want to say, just for today, I hate you PLTR. I fucking hate you you fucking fuck shit fuck.
“Never take her serious, if she got insta fame”

— hit boy
Fuck you GME & PLTR
Well I am a idiot. I have no clue what I am doing on robinhood nor how to post.
bc WSB collectively is super autistic which really just means very good at predicting everything, gaining a lot, and then eventually losing it
good song
Yes and the market doesn't like it. 

Its not even a mentionable part of babas revenue.
The stock has a gap to fill...😑 before takeoff🚀🚀🚀
Why and the fuck wouldn’t you pull out like $100k when you were at your high? That’s a lotta fuck around money.
I had to rollover the put I sold
699.99
*You can earn money in the stock market 🥴*
The top holdings aren’t going to crash. Republicans will still fund green corporations
Lol. Who’s selling GME at these prices? More shorts selling?
At dominos folding boxes rethinking life
So I have to wait a year to realize these gains. Are you retarded?
PLTR
Indubitably.
buying SPY 375c expiring jan 4. No way MMs cuck us the first trading of new year. right? RIGHT??
I wish I had a dead sister I could fuck because it would be better than this day
Calls on this dude. He’s going to the moon

No
the hell is propping up spy? everythings red
Painful (but funny) to see those fomo traders lose money. Diversification is an abstract term to them.
[removed]
I hope it drops to 17 I will literally go all on at that price..... but yeah I think it’s dropping to around 22
PLTR is not taking me to the promised land. Not today anyway
Things will look better monday
If enough people buy more PLTR they promise\* it will hit 40 Next Year
i am gaped
Zoom gonna pump in January?
Its basically an agressive sales team with shit software. Its a fucking dog
Yessir.
Don't know how some of you are still in PLTR calls.

4 days straight of a straight line down just to get theta'd and delta'd.
Clearly you have an issue with others being happy. Perhaps you’re unhappy with yourself?
[removed]
At least you lost it before the end of the year - otherwise you'd still owe taxes on those 'gains' you evaporated.
TSLA over or under 700 EOD?
Sometimes you just have to remind yourself that the Market is just a Big Ho that likes to try to fuck everyone a few times a year.
Predict the day spy hits 400
I'm not. I'm speaking ill of you.

Tbh, the fact that you're so autistic makes me second guess jumping back in at all.
Based off what?
U were an autistic dude, pretty overweight, at a wendy's, and we locked eyes over our cracked iphone 5s. Hoping this gets to u ❤️
ROFL i laughed for a good minute.

I'm not talking about a boxing match dude. Whats Mayweather going to do about being tackled to ground by someone who's so much bigger they look like different species? What I think a lot of people are misunderstanding is that. If Mayweather is brought to the ground by my sample size guy, he can't do much. Doesn't have the leverage to compensate for the difference in mass, not the reach to do anything significant once pinned. He's a tough guy but he doesn't defy anatomical science.
yeah but he doesn't have 100k either so ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
I’ve noticed that. But it still ends the day green
positions?
All of them as usual, can’t wait to see them slaughtered in the January bull run

My adult daughter needs a “cash gift” from me to buy her first house. I sold some penny stocks, rolled it all into Tesla on a dip, - but can’t bring myself to sell the shares, the growth is unbelievable. 

So sold lots of covered calls on other stocks,
with decent premiums, and sent her that money.
Today was gross 🤮
good shit bro. Hope u got rich🤑
Lmao tslas battle for 700
Fair enough. Now do yourself a gigantic favor and Uber Eats some Taco Bell so it shows up right at your door just when you’re launching into the stratosphere. Big Brain play right there.
Im interested in hearing some actual bearish hypothesis for this. Are you just saying this or do you have some substance to that claim?
No, no.  Not me. Maybe a narwhale or two

Yeah, not a good look
Is everything gonna be ok?
And if not mid February for sure!
It's starting to become an intraday P/D

Anyone know what is causing this new downward GME spike?
Some major announcement.
When should we start taking profits from GME? In the next 2 weeks GME will go to 25~30 I’m confident
My position 500 shares 20.82$
salesforce remains one of the few companies on my black list, after a decade of trading. fuck that company, fuck its earnings, management even called me a little dick on twitter. never buying myself into that torture again
is it smart to sell far otm covered calls on gme/pltr?
Here comes the rug pull. This weekend Trump announces his grand scheme and we wake up to SPY at 355.
PLTR gonna tank as people are going to be harvesting losses
Because I'm in monthlies

Just look at the chart and see for yourself bro. We’re gonna have to baghold this for a while and it’ll be a rough road to recovery.
Hey there guys I couldn’t help but notice how much you didn’t buy the fucking dip today
It seems, in your quest for 500k deliveries...you killed him.
Take a percentage of your winnings and move it to long term holdings. 

At least you won't have to pay taxes on your winnings this year, and maybe a few years into the future.
If your playing GME for the squeeze your an idiot

Been scalping pltr all day.  Not sure if i want to buy 160k in stocks of pltr or gme now.  Both are a good buy for long hold imo.

They are managed ETFs, they'll bounce back eventually.  Just sucks taking a 10% haircut right off the bat.
Remember that you are just on a drug, and that you **will** eventually feel normal again. For now, enjoy the ride!
Boys, do yourself a favour and exit any bullish or long position you have in salesforce. It is a heap of shit that is gonna tank
I dunno. Start with me and see what happens?
unironically this
So YOURE the culprit whale 😂 I keep slapping awards on OP’s post with the coins
Yeah but who know. This thing could drop another 10% next week.

I hope so
Damn all those folks who gloated about getting in on PLTR at $18 might need to start sweating.

I am definitely not planning to hold through merger. Just a little pump when the merger ramp up starts and then I'm out. Holding SPACs through merger is like holding through earnings - it might work, but mostly doesn't
You legit predicted this shit, good job.

It's not surprising that nobody read this though lmao
theyll never shut down wsb because we buy the most awards and give reddit the most money

That’s about average I’d say

It's gonna crash again. We saw this exact bubble in 2017-2018, at the SAME time too lol fall/winter 

It moons, takes all the other coins with it, then they all crash, it stays flat for a while, then slowly melts up, moons, and crashes again

It's a cycle, you need to learn how to time it and ride it

I gotta say though the easiest money I ever made was buying ethereuooom at $10 and selling at like $700
Probably, whatever, idk!
some flows came in for 1/29/21 21c for IQ. only around 40 dollars and stock is Oversold on the daily chart
PLTR really wants to go back below 20.
No more pussies leaving before bell
These last two weeks were the worst trading weeks of the year for me. Lost 30k but still up 10k for the year but still hurts
Is going all in on PLTR on Monday a mistake? Shares for a multi-year hold!
Watch as **TSLA** does a sudden dive to $699 in the last minute of trading to fuck over all the 12/31 700C option holders today. So predictable!
Bro???
They literally can’t call out a “pattern” after it’s been trading for a little over 2 months. Volatility was up and now it’s waning, as well as YE sell offs. It’s on sale right now if anything. Holding shares for at least a year
No

It’s probably because a lot of retards think the lockup ends on the last day of Q4. What these retards who cannot read, failed to realize that the lockup ends on the 3rd day after the results of their Q4 earnings are released. 

So many retards out there
My buddies and I are discussing coming up with the next big upper middle class white women “thing”, making an MLM out of it, and then living the American dream:   Selling the company for a ton of money and having the buyers take on all legal liabilities.
That’s what I’m doing. Balls deep
Pltr closes under 24 and GME closes under 19 because shorts. Hopefully goes up after the new year
Probably just rebalancing their portfolio
CRM calls ... these bags are getting heavy 😅
You fucked up. See you next year.

You’re a fucking idiot
TSLA $700 this morning: we eating tendies tonight bitches. 
TSLA $700 this afternoon: ya’ll got anymore of that ramen?
Bruh I’m still searching for what is pumping SPY. Lol
Silver lining: at least you lost it all before the end of the year so you don't have to pay taxes on the 98k that you had made. This could be WAY worse even though it's already bad.

I sincerely hope anyone with GME gets out while the gettin is good. This is a trash company and it will go bankrupt.
I'm a big fan of it, but you and every other WSB tard pumped the fuck out of it. 

I'll buy back in later
Seriously, traders gotta trade something for three long, pointless days.
Yeah i'm joking about it because losing those calls brings me from +250% to +130%, money i made on PLTR up to 30 and another couple plays. If those were all in YOLOs i would have $ROPEd my balls!
T dont cocktease me like this 😐

How fucked?
Covid stocks were a 2020 thing.
Is it true, that margin calls expire end of year?

Who the fuck had a call on my account... idiot. Mr Margin should get some puts.

This level of retardation I strive for
I had one call expiring today 700c went. All the way up to 17$ but I let it ride and ended at $3.6

It was oversold...it may bounce back.
Baller, can i come over dad?
This hurts
Just bought 1,089 shares of PLTR @ $23.70/share

Hopefully, it’s quick profit on Monday morning

Why are we talking about private companies?
Ahhh
VW short squeeze had totally different circumstances and a short to float ratio of 12:1 which is not the case with GME. but a squeeze will happen. And yes, trading gets temporarily halted for stocks if they increase but in the case of a squeeze that wouldnt stop it from squeezing it only lasts a couple of minutes

Same. Real estate hasn't yet recovered from the March crash. And it will.
It's on sale today
Dow stocks, not meme stocks.
If u are bullish long term you could sell February $31C and buy Back when it is 15 DTE then sell March $31C
$31C on Feb 19 sells for 1.35 right now
100% yes. The weekly rsi is 92 you fukin idiot lmao. This is coming from someone who made 100k last month from Mara. You’re just way too late and way too dumb
Gotta know when to pull out fellow tard

Yeah she could have absolutely cashed in if she wanted. Although the fame she got from it is priceless, she’ll probably always be able to easily make money.

2020 was the sacrifice the Mouse needed to evolve into a stallion
The squeeze wasn’t going to happen today. Today is the perfect opportunity for folks to load up on shares and LONG dated calls. Taking actual shares off the market will put more pressure on shorts

Why? It’s performing well for a sell off day
It is today for US. Canada has different regulations and for some reason a ton of people are confused about that in here
I was hoping for a clear moment to double down GME, thankyou Melvin for this discount.
Im saying, bruh
i was thinking about it
PLTR is not going to moon until it breaks every single one of ours hearts and we vow to never touch it again.
Too bad we can’t invest in it
Shartcoin will hit 30k this weekend because we can't trade stonks M. ARA and R. IOT to the moon
Nah I still hard disagree. I’ve seen small high level guys piece up even journeyman level heavyweights in Muay Thai and MMA gyms many times. I’ve been on the receiving end of a few myself unfortunately and it doesn’t do wonders for the ego when you know you couldn’t hit someone with a handful of rice.
Misinformation spreads quicker than information nowadays :/
Yeah they announced bankruptcy today
GILD up 2% today which is like 30% for it if you’ve been following the stock the past 6 months. 

Really think it’s gonna take off in the new year after funds have tax loss harvested and see how undervalued it is. 7.5 year low, it’ll most likely be bought out or merge.
Buy calls then.  I keep telling ya’ll, with the amount of short positions built up we are getting our asses kicked until call volume goes way up or a short squeeze occurs early 2021.  Palantards need to take a page from GME gang playbook, they were patient, kept buying calls and when it finally happened the short squeeze was MASSIVE.
What are we maxing our margin into over the weekend?

Is today Sextuple WiTcHiNg?  
I hope so.

profit taking most likely, check back next week
SPG and SPR looking solid.

Sold off my SPR, it will drip into low to mid 30s again within next month. Buy it all back when it dips. New play for me.

lmao just look at the number of BABA calls exp today with 235+ strikes. I honest believe that old news was paid by MMs just to kill the options. BABA drops with no volume today. Calls EOD.
Fuck it, there’s too much red. I’m going to close my broker app and not look at stocks again until after the new year. Take care retards.
it’s a good company i think it’s the matter of whether the valuation justified, what’s your thought on this

I've bought the dip each of the last three days, up to 400 shares and 10x Jan 2022 50c
This isn’t even finished. This is meant to be a long post because it covers so many things. There will be enough time to come back and digest pieces at a time.

Maybe it’s because I’ve done worse, but I feel like the past week or two hasn’t been kind to most of us
ah, very good.

what happened to TSLA today? Up now down
I was reading about the VW infinity squeeze and it shot from 60 to 900! I don't know if that would be possible with GME since everyone has their eyes on it. Also, isn't there some sort of mechanism to stop a stock from skyrocketing? I think that happened to A-C-Y this week when it increased 1000% in an hour or two.

At least save half on big gains
Wrong place to ask tbf
I literally bought at the peak
Fair enough. :)
They’re giving up because they bought at the absolute top

I still like PLTR, bought when it was $14 and sold at $22 (eh, profit is profit), but I don’t trust it any more now that it has meme status. Seeing WSB pump this thing and then immediately paper hands it makes it feel too volatile
In that case, where is the *sell all* button on Robinhood?

how so? its 12/31 i thought which is today

I’m just sitting here giggling like an idiot
Whoever uses WeBull, you know Robinhood is better. WeBull takes your money from the deposit and waits a full 5 days even when they have your money and it is settled. Robinhood gives you the money right away hoping you have the transfer completely. 

Summary don't use WeBull and just stick with robinhood. Only use webull as a last resort. It sucks so much.

Where my little chicken head at? You in here bro, can't find ya gotta sift through too much dicks. Back in 2018 around trade war time you were going off about chicken and how Tyson was going to corner the chicken market because Chinas chickens got the flu. Did you ever profit? I got into a pretty heated chicken debate and I still think about how passionate our chicken related argument was. Completely forgot his username, been a huge void in my life

Oh I’m not giving up, I will ride it to zero before I sell, it’s just fun to gripe.
hope so, MMs did a pretty good job in the first half getting to $700
Anyone trading in margin with Robinhood is losing bro. A real broker will just make purchases on margin and you’ll have an actual line of credit instead of their bogus “we’ll use your cash first then margin” bullshit that doesn’t let you withdraw money if you’re “fully invested”
Well the rest of the world thinks you are a douchebag
I think GME is a company that either produces  something or provides some form of service. I’d look into it, but I’m too busy buying more.

Well that's the clearest sign ever that everything in my portfolio is completely uncorrelated to the indices
TSLA out here fighting $700 for its life
Where do we see Zoom near term in 2021?

At the ATH up $11k.. Thank God for some solid shares at $290 but that has net gone to like $100 dollars fucking A. I'm planning to hold it till year end 2021... Vaccine won't make them go poof into thin air and Eric is pretty innovative 

Very happy to see Moderna and Biontech take a massive dump down 45% vs the recent ATH and rocket shil up parabolically 

Also fucking Macy's and Michaels and Kohls. I cannot believe they're still being supported and hope strain #2 has these shitty companies plummet where they belong. Who here is bullish in Macy's?! 🤡🤡🤡🤡
Someone tell me what dd means then downvote me to hell for asking

I wonder how much money you all are going to lose by closing.
can some body explain to me what does this prove? hasn't they made money under $19?

it has never gone past $20 today
at least you didn't lose it all after 2020 and have to pay capital gains tax on top of having no money to pay for it.

I think a lot of people are following the unusual options activity, which then creates more unusual options activity, and it's a positive feedback loop, especially when the options are super cheap like $5/contract. That post alone boosted it a lot.

Imagine betting this much money against the most meme stock in the history of the stock market. Wowzers.
The narrator (Nathan Fielder) poses as a business expert who helps failing businesses. He then proposes fucking crazy ideas for comedic purposes and a small portion of the business owners agree because they're on TV. A horse can carry fat people but the business owners don't allow it due to increased liability. Watch the show it's funny as fuck it's on HBO Max and was on Hulu not sure if it still is.

Enjoy yummy blue screen
Market makers love him!
Seriously, the fuck is this shit
This usually happens with people who luck out on options. In a way, it's crueler to have lucked out first with options because people tend to think it's their skill, and they invest more and bet bigger, until this happens. 

Maybe now you'll get rid of your hubris and learn the fundamentals of investing.
Not until Monday sadly
Webull is such shit it’s made me trade stocks now, settled funds necessary for options my ass
They need to open up options on that one. Tired of bagholding and not even being able to get some theta money
I mean I am so fucked. SPY up all week, my stocks red all week. If there is a correction next month, I'm sure my fucking stocks will be red yet again. Good job. Nice end to the year. Love my life!!! Things are great!!!!! COOL!!!!!!! THANKS STONK MARKET!
I made $600 in the last 1hour selling tsla puts straight after buying. Kinda fucked myseld and went all in again. Need a big dump at close
*year
Those random box scams actually are very profitable too so who knows. I think it might do well but didnt seem like it got a lot of attention since the pump and dump
An end to shutdowns are in sight. Why would it keep going up? It's basically a stay at home stock.
Just opened 1 year short on FB. You heard it here first.

what the fuck happened to Tesla?
Its trades big volume on tsx and asx listing tho. But yes it is low on otc. 

Just such a special project such that its a tailings deposit so they know where the ore is. And its already mostly processed and is so close to the car manufacturers.
DUMP IT!

TSLA limit down 👺
at least you don't owe any taxes
Who bought TSLA FDs above 710? Show yourselves, I know there’s at least one of you
Today's a good buying opportunity I doubled down  
🚀🚀🚀
You belong here
Is the theta on calls dated a year out that significant? I’d think you’d want the higher delta.
same bro. i'd say take profits when u can and then during lock up period just wait a bit and BTFD
all that, just to close flat
cool, $5 away from becoming an amzn bag holder
lol not even close
I need the refuel to end so we can liftoff
Mr. NIO I don't feel so good
Everyone: "FUCKK why did i buy pltr its down!"
Me: "Perfect time to buy! fuck yea"
Also me: "Oh its still dipping..."
lmao r/stocks and r/investing sucks they only buy dividend boomer stonks, they'd never join PLTR gang

Can I get an award?
Tsla if you could just take a record setting shit, for like, just today that would be amazing.

NOK NOK NOK
You guys are retarded. I’m up 400% in the last 3 months because I buy the dip. Stop buying something when it’s already 3%+ up on the day. And buy leaps, not FDs
Fuck you KR 😡

Ily SPY 😚
That is literally what I'm saying. I know from experience being a drunken angry prick who wrestled in high school that if you outweigh someone by 30% of their body weight, that putting your knee on their abdomen means game over. Pinned with their fucking head exposed like a pinata.

Why?
Weeklies
When I see 55 year old men walking back from Target in Skechers with a 5th in their pocket wearing an outfit off the Walmart sales rack I question how they haven’t shot themselves in the head yet. Imagine being dirt broke in your older years, that’d be a nightmare
hmm... gave up on them back in 2015. maybe its time to get back in...
Of everything I could have bought today I bought god damn ARKK bro, getting shit smeared all over my lips

Lol remember the retard on CNBC saying ZM was gonna hit $600 and had a price target of like $700? He bought shares at $580.
WTF is ZM doing. This is my reward for holding it for weeks, nonstop bleed???
Any new reasons to sell next year? No? Bullish.
That's why I make my money selling my sister's underwear at flea markets every sunday. Cash business baby, can't trace that shit

tsla probably moves in a couple penny range into close now to stop scalpers from making a dollar on the just below 700 close.
Nokia gang?
Even Playboi Carti couldn’t have expected this Whole Lotta Red today
If you look at 6 month out GME graph, that’s a textbook cup and handle - good timing with 13D, sales numbers, and other good news they may have this weekend. 

#NOWS THE TIME TO GET IN BOIS 🚀🚀🚀
First hopefully good play I’ve made this month
At the expense of a 20% chance of permanent damage lol no thanks. That's a very expensive bet.
Go take in fresh air for the first time instead of your mother’s second-hand smoke. Go touch some grass you school shooting, sister fucking, moron and stop talking shit on Reddit and and beating the shrimps Mayo monkey to incest porn
What are the good dips though?
Hmmmmm, 1 year LEAPs that need NEE to go up 15% to break even, or 2 year LEAPs that need NEE to go up 28% to break even?

Yo venmo me $12.961.16 I will return 600% profit by next week.
So what should I buy puts on  going into the long weekend?
Which dip we buyin?
elon tsla giving me a kick in the balls at the moment. good thing my fetish is ball busting!
There are significantly more shares to short available again:  [IBorrowDesk](https://iborrowdesk.com/report/GME)   
Did the shorter already start closing their positions?
you know, part of the problem i have i think is because i don't chew my food enough
What do you do fir a living
I wanted to buy puts when it was over 160 I shoulda done it
CTRL + Z
People actually love this type of shit tbh, had a makeup sub thing just like it for 2 ex gfs and they both loved it.
Me this morning: “ok, you’ve done well don’t go playing TSLA FD’s this afternoon and lose it all”

Me this afternoon: “fuck”
1M buy volume in 25 minutes?  How am I lying
Likely going to work out very well for you.

Okay yeah I found it in their sec filings. People who previously were locked up until January 31st are now eligible to sell on January 7th. So it’s not a dilution but it’s a pretty large amount that could now be sold. I hope I’m not too fucked. I ended up doing 245/240 credit put spreads instead of debit call spreads but I wish I saw your reply first haha

Not only are you a true retard, a 🌈🐻, but you’re also a hypocrite, the triple crown. Congratulations, retard.
u guys realize probs next week it'll normalize right? if u wanna sell, sell, but I think u'll come to regret it. im glad it came down so I can get assigned on my puts and ill prob keep these babies for a long ass time or if it goes up to 30 again.

I am a $28 bag holder, true.  But I am certainly not in denial about anything.  Just hopeful and I don’t like to sell low.

Fucking LOVE that guy. I wish he were still around. Died way before his time
Did you lose on TSLA?
It's up less than half of a percent.
I have no clue what to expect next week
Same
I know several people that got it. The younger ones just had a bad "flu" and lost their taste/smell for a while, but the older ones died. One of them was in his 50's and super obese and he died last week.

MT gang as well. This one will require patience. Ready for liftoff   🚀🚀🚀🚀
Meme stocks? Any individual stock can tank, I'm talking about a correction in the market as a whole which would affect most people on here not just those buying stocks that already ran hundreds of percent.

Me: “But you still end up with more money right?”
TSLA gonna end red at this pace 😟
Dude: fuck off. You’re that same little twit posting all that dumb Nazi shit on stocktwits the other day huh. Let me tell you something: nothing about that is witty or insightful or funny. And when family members of yours have actually met their ends in those gas chambers, well then it becomes something that you tend to react pretty strongly to. So how’s this: either take down that comment or DM me your address so I can come by and kick your fucking teeth in you stupid Nazi fuck.
TSLA looking like an iron condor

Sir, this is a Gambler's Anonymous
I’m still here, I’m going all in. Buying the dip. I’ve done this before with biotech and I’ve been in 100-200% binary events. This is a big one. The sell off appears to be major players taking profit/ selling the news from all the vaccine stocks. But if NVAX hits it will be the smallest market cap company to do so (without a major partner). Their market cap is tiny and this is their opportunity to break into the big leagues with their tech. So I have complete conviction. 

My only worry is that the trial has been delayed because the rollout of the other vaccines. Maybe people are dropping out of the trial to get the other vaccines available
WSBA is taken in Texas,  so next we  are gonna see WSBA ..WSBB..WSBC.. like Chamath’s SPACS

Anyone touching the arkg dip
Why DKNG been going down past month and PENN up? I know PENN is older and got more money, but they used to go up and down w/ each other. Not so much lately...
Free money
Honestly it scares me how foolish some of you guys are, I have so much more experience than the lion share of you at this and I barely play options, only when I know it’s a 99% chance. But here you guys are less than a few months in this shit and don’t even understand yearly patterns and you just yolo your whole accounts on the dumbest plays. Why? I don’t understand
This shit so rigger LMAO, how is SPY going up so much when everything is dumping
This mfs are crazy.
Dude 6 ft 240 is a fucking big dude, maybe you're the doughy 6ft 240 but I'm obviously talking about someone who's in shape

I should add that those you tube videos you're referencing are 100% the little old man snapping on some drunken retard who's not expecting to be punched. And that I'm not talking about fighting him in one of those gay technical boxing matches Mayweather loves so much

And yet WMT stock isn’t rocketing today
She said "bi?" Wants to watch her bf do you.  Something new for 2021?

I've been really fucked the last few years trying to trade in my IRA. It just never works. It works in taxable, but fucking shit knows it's in an IRA and dumps. I would've had 3-4x if I just bought some shitty fund and held. So over these rigged markets

do you really think it is overpriced at $24. In a few years when it's a $1.000 it's not going to matter.
lol since when do traders need social skills? Just stare at a screen all day. My friend who’s a trader just gets yelled by his boss at whenever he turns red P/L and never congratulated for a green day. And this is at a bulge bracket.
Why be gay for weeks to do this now SPY??
nope. theres a gay bear shorting it. fuck that guy

You will know in your gut if you are humble. If you see your account value going parabolic, it’s time to protect yourself. That’s the rule of thumb. If you humble, you’ll think “this can’t continue.”  If you’re not, you’re probably thinking you are a goddamn genius. 

I made $193k in the last 3 months and sold most of my trades (about 85%) on Tuesday at open. Yesterday I put all of that cash in Ess pee Aaa Sees near NAV and I plan on taking a trading break until probably the end of January.

what in SPY is pushing it up? TSLA drilling
Om planning on shorting tesla at some point too but I'm not fucking retarded enough to do it now while ots breaking ATH everyday with the cult growing more amd more delusional everyday. Waiting for a catalyst that will change public perception. Im guessing it'll be either the cyber truck/roadster/semi not coming, people realizing fsd might not even happen in our lifetime, or we might just have to wait until they just go bankrupt when they lose the ev market to the legacy manufacturers.
GME delivering through doordash is very bullish. It shows that they are trying to work with the shipping backlog issue. I've seen people make fun of it on here but I think It's a good sign
Maybe I should start a blog posting my moves so you guys can inverse me and retire this year.
Aww miss trading that bad boy, a few restless nights thanks to their stock, not their coffee though, that shit is 4/10

Anyone wanna wager Elon splits this again in 2021?

Not CS but business info sys masters checking in to answer this question about how you, the Small Business Enterprise, can benefit from PLTR -

Wait about 5-10 years for them to offer a free SaaS trial model. PLTR is not intended for SME usage, it is just not their business model yet.

On a different note, if you want a more relevant answer, platforms like Gotham (so something that can interlink different data sources based on a topic and provide insights or inferences) offer SMEs more strategic unscheduled and unstructured decision making support at an executive level - so for your company, this hypothetical platform may glean insights into events, or factors, that influence purchasing patterns of your goods by your target market that you had no idea about. This may enable you to identify opportunities, or issues, but also predict when or if certain clothing items are more likely to sell (or less likely) based on these inferences. This can affect anything from your logistical network/business activities to your competitiveness against the power of your suppliers, customers or competitors. 

A potential reason why SMEs are not targeted is because this level of strategic decision making support by AI and Machine Learning is still a very much new field for most enterprises, and is affected by a massive under-supply of data scientists/engineers as well as the field of business internet-of-things (smart enterprises) still being relatively new (but growing at an alarming pace). Ideally you want to invest in any company that is trying to simplify, streamline and commercialize AI-decision making support for businesses, or government.
Not enough risk. Only end of day calls.
Unusual whales has NIO calls and PLTR puts for next week - do whatever with that info as you will
I see GME post, I upvote, award and buy more shares. Godspeed fellas! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Scaling limit sells. 10% of shares at 45, 20% at 55, 50% at 70, 20% at 100. Thats my personal plan, although I have never played a short squeeze before and I have no idea how high this one will reach, though 100 is my somewhat optimistic while trying to stay realistic price target for it. I will obviously adjust this as time goes by though, like if there was a massive spike after january sales release or soemthing

This bitch is going to take off so hard it won't go to the moon, or the sun for that matter. It will move the entire fucking solar system DOWN from its momentum. Get onboard or start practicing your speech to your wife's boyfriend's grandchildren about how you could have done a thing that one time but didn't.
I could hear the price going up in my head. Very intense.
Buy them when it hits 22, sell when it gets close to 29. Then wait for it to come back to 22, sell when it gets close to 29. Then wait for it to come back to 22, sell when it gets close to 29. Then wait for it to come back to 22, sell when it gets close to 29. Then wait for it to come back to 22, sell when it gets close to 29. Then wait for it to come back to 22, sell when it gets close to 29... you get the idea
Alex Karp, 8 letters. Elon Musk, 8 letters.

PLTR, 4 letters. TSLA, 4 letters.

PLTR, the next TSLA. 

Simple logic.
I feel like we will run mid January but I’ve been wrong 9 out of 8 times the past two months

Incredible nonsense. A person who’s job it was to be a professional fighter will beat 99% of untrained folks even if they’re bigger, let alone someone at mayweather’s level (elite of the elite). 

There are many videos of pensioner age former journeymen boxers sparking out younger larger men who were fucking with them. Turns out if it’s your fucking job to do something and you do it more than anyone else you’ll be better at it than anyone else. To give a non boxing example, you and posting nonsense

 Nothing in the SP500 is green. Lol wtf.
Lmao I know I’ve lived a lot of places but still
I cant wait to looks my money yay
Just buy leaps m8. I bought PLTR 30cs for Jan 2022.  Sell weeklies with the high IV.  Rinse and repeat.  You'll make all your money back
Fill me up whit your juice.

Dear Reddit,

Bears touched me in inappropriate places today. See you next year.

You fucking asshole I spat all over myself reading that. Although it’s my own fault for being retarded enough to do that.
You're not wrong

Past month I've undone half my gains of the year... wtf


Coincides with me subbing here
Well fuck me. Finally bit the bullet and sold my MRNA for $3500 loss. Feels bad man, but better to claim the loss this year than not.
nice catch, from 14:10 to 15"00 totally reversed....wtf is that.....still lots of hedges that need to get worked out ??
This is a moment to reflect and acknowledge those that called us retarded in 2020 for our stupid trades.
Oh man I'll be out of these virtual credits soon. Need to ReUP.
You and me both. Just wished we had the audio to hear their screams before they jump.

Why?
Pork belly futures
Started in late September with GME and Chinese EV. Got burned until election when I made 2,000% on some ACB calls. EXPEV NIO and TSLA calls in November gave me a nice profit. Got burned on PLTR. Sittin al in on GME right now. 

Started with about 2k, paid myself back 3k and have 3k in my RH. 

Small stuff compared to some of the autist gods here but I’m happy so far with it.

Yeah okay SPY, so legal.
There was a correction in Dec? I must've missed the 10% drop.

Will you just fucking accept my thank you? You were already a dick thinking it was actually necessary to correct an internet stranger on a one letter typo.
Its because you didn't buy enough reddit rewards
Buy when everyone else is scared
That’s complete cherrypicking based on hindsight though. If he got a 10 bagger from 2k to 20k then lost it all you could’ve said 20k was the right time to pull out. Or 4k after he doubled. It’s too hard to tell at the time
Lmao. Was at this price a month ago.
Para what?
there is a Qanan sub?
same here
Proof of positions first. Platty second

Lol I’m playing this everyday
69 gold. Nice
Why?
Why not buy NVAX instead?
Well when is it? There’s no way to know. On the journey from 2k to 100k, there’s so many times when he could pull out. He could’ve pulled out at 4k after he doubled, at 10k, 20k, etc... only with hindsight are we telling him he should’ve pulled out at 100k right before he lost
If you're very lucky, maybe something will happen, like Trump foments a civil war, or Biden gets assassinated, or Iran declares war, pushing the market down like 20% like it did in Feb, letting you start all over again like the Brian McKnight song.
Fuck you too

Satan satan satan
Not touching it until it can hold its gains for a day
I called it again telling you guys to buy calls on TSLA for the reversal
I don't believe in things like support lines. When stocks fall thus much it usually means there is likely some fraud going on and insiders are dumping their shares before the news gets out. This happened recently with a company called Enron.
Whatcha mean? GME short squeeze. Hold the shares until at least after Q4 earnings
DoorDash delivered my most recent same day order from GameStop. If that isn’t a sign I don’t know one 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

calls on MCD and YUM. these stimmy checks are going straight to poor people food
Ya I second this can u re-do
Well technically you lost 1k but hopefully you have learned something. Weekly calls are super high risk but also high reward. Buying calls a few months away reduces risk and reward but the reward is still far better than just the stock and you can leverage dips
Americans are a housebroken people
After the year we have had, it's only natural SPY has to end at ATH

PLTR will close green today. Mark this post.
Absolute silence from ZMtards lately

it had reached the meme status around here a while ago
i didnt hear no bell
I would stay away from chinese ev companies. I heard from somewhere that chinese government is going to crack down on EV vehicles due to the damage that batteries are doing to the environment.
She ugly as hell bro, dont be fool by that makeup
just pick a new stock. jesus and don't buy puts right next to a support line. Eoy does this and the first monday goes green. tunnel vision will burn you
that's a good thing to consider and possibly. 

However, the beautiful thing about PLTR is their algos and software make logistics, inventory maintenance, storage...literally everything more efficient. By a large margin. Some customers claim a 50% to 60% increase in efficacy. So it's possible if there are budget cuts the opposite would happen, different state/military departments would flock to PLTR in an attempt to save themselves on cost. 

After Mitch the Bitch blocked the $2k stim checks, that, IMO, is when the GOP lost the senate. Especially after the two senators in the GA runoff came out in support of it. If you're still a long term believer in the stock, just hedge as best you can and hold the line.
What if the Mayans were dyslexic and the world is supposed to end in 2021 instead of their prediction of 2012. Explains 2020.

Consolidating to make a huge run next week.

Need some real DD. HEAR was 2018, I think it was a one hit wonder like meatloaf. IF you really want autists on like myself post your DD. hard pass otherwise
All with meme stocks I salute you Sir of all Sirs 🤝
I’ve never seen so many awards in my year and a half on this app
I like your diversified portfolio, smart man

you spelled gain wrong
I'm aware. It's been hugging 220 for weeks though.
No doubt
I’m literally asking though.
Go buy a bag of weed then flip that shit like the rappers do
When the next correction happens, this place is going to be quite entertaining if people are already freaking out over small dips.
PG - Procter & Gamble - calls looking nice. Solid boomer company, dividend play, and they report earnings 1/20/2021.

That would be insane
No retards here called PLTR $23 EOY.    We suck!
i bought 1 spy put for the giggles

am i gay?
Because if the stock increases by even $1 then the person earns $53,000.
Still weeding out people... Not sure how many will be left in the end.. :(
i’m a noob sue me
>omeone just placed a one million dollar bet on NIO 2/19/22 40c..

40c or $50?
New Years Resolution? Quit gambling because I’m broke now
wat.

It's more than \*double\* the size of the PC gaming industry. 

Most of the growth of the gaming industry in the last ten years is mobile.

The only way you could argue that's it's not relevant is if you think that it's completely orthogonal to pc / console gaming; that a person who currently spends three daily hours playing Fortnite mobile or Among Us has not reduced their pc / console gaming hours or spending habits at all. It's not 1:1, but there is definitely substantial overlap.
You saw my previous comment?

#End in red today, 2021 losses everyday.
#End in green today, 2021 big money.
I heard that a monkey throwing darts can pick better stocks than me...Can someone tell me where he is, so I can give him access to my Schwab account?
Yeah, just buy more.  That way you can say you bought them on sale when it goes up.
PSTH fomo is real. I have a couple hundred shares but now I want more lol.
watching my whole portfolio bleed to death during sour hour feels like an apropos exit to 2020.
It's hard for them to grasp this because they bought weeklies
What's your exit strategy? Thanks for the realistic DD. Everyone is trying to pump it but not giving any idea as to how they'll make sure they're not bag holding at the end
I bought at 19. I'm bearly in profit but I'm offloading this dogshit for something that will actually go up.
Only investment with an immediate return is 
#$ROPE
Oh my god tesla. You just fucked so many people lmao.
PLTR, GME, and ARKG dipped today

Only one of these plays makes you not a retard
Those look juicy
[deleted]
If there’s one relieving thing it’s that I know NIO and Xpeng didn’t get priced in for NIO day. Thank god we end the year with only upward pressure on these it’s kind of nice honestly it’ll make the bull run even sweeter January
It's power hour . Buy Buy Buy
So, ATVI breaking triple digits soon yeah?
Already ITM?
Amzn will be the go to play again when they double everyone’s Christmas earnings

Hey man, hope you made cash on this trade! I fell asleep and completely missed the pump to 146, I was ready to buy in but just missed it haha
Am I the only retard who has seen a 30% increase in the last week
Being able to adapt quickly to changes in the stock market is being smart.
What are your guys plans for New Years?
I can't wait to see pics of empty times square for nye and then pics of millions of gynese celebrating
Their wikipedia page does a decent job explaining. Lots of evil crap it seems but $20 is $20 or in my case, -$2k.
Lock up expiration on Jan 7
Why did chinese ev stonks go down, they were up so much this morning? 😭
Painstop 😔
Back with another comment for another award cuz why not. Hook me up GME gang
better to just watch the tards rise and fall when it comes to meme stocks. always the same pattern
Watch him go down 98% again
Who else is straight up not having a good time?
I am thinking we see something similar to Lemonade yesterday: selloff in anticipation of the lockout expiration then a bump day of.  

I have 1/15s so IV and theta are strangling my gains
mother fuck that's a lot of interest and volume on the tsla 700c.  riding that bitch down aren't they?
JAN calls IV is going kinda nuts today $GME 1/15 30c are up 30%... something's going on
Tesla might finish the day red
Tesla sitting at 701.28 

Peaked at 718.72

Any other PLTR holders stress eating rn?

1 stonk wont affect it that much lmao
💎👊🏻 is the plan.
Raisins are just grapes that squirted too much and need a refilling of juice
Yeah its pretty optimistic haha, but I actually have a 160c 170c spread. Paid 200 to get 1000 back if we hit 170. It only needs a 20% likelihood of going to 170 for this to be breakeven. But idk it might be a stretch, just thought it would be a fun play.
This month*
Welp lost 30k of gains diamond handing my TSLA calls... GUH still in the green for the year but that hurt papa Elon.
Hand job exercise?
[deleted]
As a consolation prize, I’ve earned the max capital loss carryover for about 6 years.
FD calls on TSLA now for the reversal if you want to gamble
Yeah, fuck that guy.
DING DONG ❄️ IS DED
Bcuz u be like more more moreeeeee


Then u get fuk
Long story short, buy the WSB meme stonk of the month very early on and never hold longer than a week
Pleas fly again
tsla 710 again today?
At least you didn't do this next week and had no money to pay the tax man
Stop fake hyping pltr... we got wrecked this week... let’s just see how it plays out at this point
Only if you're also married. Twice the excitement. Make sure to hit on her in front of your boss too.
And as long as it’s below it’s 52 week low I’m buying.
yall think tsla gona cross 710 today?
Need my portfolio to pull a tenet move and inverse itself rigjt now 🥺
lmfao it's done brother. we say this shit every week but fucking red day after red day
yep hopefully we will take profits long before then
TSLA 700 0DTE gang sweating
damn really want to but this dip as i got in at 27$ but i am already covered in red as i bought ARKK almost at the top recently..
Someone just placed a one million dollar bet on NIO 2/19/22 40c....
Looks like the 3, you'd think she could afford the S.
the irony in this comment is hilarious, assuming you bought PLTR/GME
My entire watch list been red and its all mega caps
PLTR $30 EOY but I don’t know which year
[deleted]
[deleted]
CLF is almost down for the month actually. MT is up. Why don't u zoom out lol
Nah rather get assign or wait it out , if I own the stock at least the credit I receive helps with cost basis . And I’ll sell when it’s near
Damn bro. This your last New Years?
Omg will TSLA end the year at 694.20?
[deleted]
I mean, you can buy back whenever you want, so..
Where's the guy who would eat his shit if TSLA closed red
Long dated options are very risky because they are expensive. Much safer to buy near expiration because you risk much less monies.
Have fun staying poor if you’re not buying tsla **at the top**

FTFY
Nah tech is eating shit today
First one's free bro.  Welcome to the real game now.  Use what you've learned and do it again without dumb risks.  Take profit, open spreads.
Coal hands
Who already gambled their stimmy today?
If Nio can tickle or ideally fist $50’s asshole, I will get blackout tonight. If I doesn’t I’ll still get blackout but I’ll be sad
you gotta admit, the SPY EOY pump is a fitting way to end 2020.
Meh 175+ by summer
This made me buy PLTR 30c 2/19/21 today thanks bro
Dont sell now and you catch the PM hulk dildo on monday ; sell and youll FOMO back in by tuesday
Buying $800c was the most retarded thing I ever done
Because you’re greedy
So this includes all the awards on every comment?
👆this.🤪
Wake me up when I’m rich
If this $19 wall falls its gonna TANK. It’s tried 5 times this week. It has good support, i’ll give it that.
Yeah imagine having a 0% interest savings account.
No
MMs not gonna get you away with those TSLA 700 calls... its not closing above 700 at this rate.... fkn manipulative fks.
Just cuz there’s a goalie doesn’t mean you can’t score
You rather be Rusty Williams instead of Russell Wilson?
Does the 450 have the sand escape mode for the air suspension? Because i could leave the engine if still got that. I want to be able to hit the fucking switches and make that bitch bounce like a 64 impala
Cuz they know you bought puts
ngl this TSLA fade is as impressive as its run-up this morning
If you're smart, you'll learn from this and fair much better next time you have a huge win. 

I'm guessing that you attributed too much of your performance to skill and too little to luck. Having cracked to code, you applied your skills again, because who would not want to post "2k to 1 million in 3 months" on this sub.

Good luck holding onto gains in the future!
I was holding off, thinking of the short squeeze. Then it was thinking about the console release and run up to Christmas. Still I was on the fence whether to go all in but the recent tweet activity and commitment to the cause, I’m selling everything I own and jamming it all on GME
come on spy go to 375 make my day- matter as fact make my fkin year!

Imagine buying tesla at today's ATH so set up your 2021. Good luck king
Too many bitches here worry about taxes... Worry about making good plays and you will be fine!  Being in a higher tax bracket is a good problem to have dumbasses...
Lost all my profits from my TSLA puts 1-2 hours ago from TSLA calls. I bought puts at the top, but did not buy calls at the bottom.
Gme holding up pretty well honestly
Ah ok, well like i said either valve cover gasket or hopefully only a turbo feed or drain line, if it's profusely leaking it's probably a feed line or cracked center housing of turbo itself, the drains are solid metal on those i believe and there is no pressure on them so they are unlikely to be the culprit. If you're losing oil significant amounts i'd suspect turbo feeds. That line is under recall so if you can confirm it's the line call local dealer you should be able to get it fixed for free.
I know that’s you, LOVETOFUCKMARRIEDMILFS
Man you better hope Tesla drills for the next hour
PLTR is gonna moon on January 18 exactly
clearly, yes.
Buy monthly put
Let’s go CRM you little bitch!!!!!
Besides the day you were born
PLTR GONNA MOON NEXT WEEK BOYS
Wilfred got me hard
Good job. Now you can retire in 300 years if you keep doing that
This is insane. How do you get so lucky to multiple your money many times over and don’t think for once that you can’t continue doing it.. you need to talk to a professional
Watch when they all rush back into stonks monday because they got nothing else to do with there tendies
How come I always hold something too long?  SHOP BABA TSLA :(
When TSLA was going up, SPY was down. Now that SPY is going up, TSLA is dropping. Almost like it didn't get added to the index.
[deleted]
Automatically?
TSLA dropping like it's Times Square
His annual is just enough for two drinks and a tip at the Ritz.  SAD

Did the same thing in 2017.  Fucking xvg.  Anyway. Do let the rest of us know your plays next year.  You obviously know how to win. You just don't know how to keep your winnings.
Sour hour GUH
RIP PLTR & MY PORTFOLIO
I see a minivan. Its also just a 450
TSLA at 700  and NIO at 50. NIO so undervalued, it shud go to 700. WSB DD lol.

Jack Ma needs to throw the Chinese govt a lavish party and kiss ass, do something to reinforce loyalty. This is part of the game. Unbelievable how he can be frivolous with his mouth and criticize a dictatorship. And reason why BABA went down 30%. Maybe the man is not Chinese, perhaps an alien 👽🛸
Yeah at some point you just wonder why people even invest then. Just go to a casino if you plan on cratering everytime you win.
I mean yeah that's why ARKG exists.... Specially to track genetic engineering companies
Got any coupons for the stock price?
[removed]
ALL IN NIO AND MT FUCK IT 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Yeah, but that will take much longer to go from $2k to $100k and then lose it all. At least OP lost it all quickly to start over sooner.
Y'all remember when PLTR was finally looking to break through that $29 wall right before christmas?
Should have sold all... end of year run-up for funds to end high didn't happen for PLTR... Only goes down, in a very straight line if you look at the week
Retards never learn man, it’s so frustrating but just let them lose their positions as we take them
Right when I got my calls it just keeps dropping every day. History always repeats itself so it's not likely to stop dropping anytime soon. I'm expecting it to be under 10 by end of next week.
SELL PLTR

FRAUD SCAM PUMP N DUMP

I’m not that proud of this, but here’s the truth:

Started buying at $3, sold off at $4.25. Rebought at $4.75, sold at $3.50 😭. Rebought at $6, sold at $10, rebought at $12-$16.
Watching QS
I think it’ll smash $10 calls anytime in late winter/early Spring and $15 in summer. I nibbled some $10 Jan calls today given early voting news in Georgia.

What would have been great is if you finished 2020 with a 100k gain and lost it all on the first week of 2021 so that you owed all these taxes but had no money to pay it.
Penis
Oh SPY, you so silly
My guess is SPY will drop before EOD but I really don't know. Too much EOM/EOQ/EOY big player stuff that is over my head.

Agreed, tons of companies are working on data, I can’t imagine they have something very scalable because everyone is going for scalability, otherwise you just have a bunch of consultants
They get upset if you say that and think downvoting you makes them less stupid.
I thought he was talking specifically to the Tesla bears. Who literally always lose and never give up. But since everyone misunderstood everyone we should just agree we are all dumb
I wanna see the PLTR loss porn in a month or 2

Buying dips is good but gotta spot where prices are likely to bounce. Seems like most people are just buying at random prices just because the stock went down.

2/19 100c looks good to me. I’m buying a few today and will average down next week if it keeps dropping. Next earnings will be in April if you want to go further out.

DOCU is only down 10% ish. PLTR is down 17% in 5 days. That extra 7% drop really crushed my portfolio and theta thesis.
More promising news: 

"The company issued 10.75 million shares. Since the amount of shares on the market is small, \[the CEO Greg Bentley\] said the company expects some volatility in the stock price and will probably issue primary shares later to get a more “robust float.”

Based on the initial $22 stock price, the company was valued at more than $5.7 billion on Wednesday morning. That value rose to $8.7 billion by the end of the day.

Bentley Systems brought in revenue of $737 million in 2019, and reported a $103 million profit. Its software is used in 171 counties to design large-scale projects including electric and water utilities, wind farms and airports.

doubt it bro. I'm getting fucked hard & I'm starting to like it. I think it will drill to 0 or negative tbh 😭🤪
Just wait until PLTR has another 100% run up then buy at the top again
Any chance of DASH going up this month ?
Anyone remember how first weeek of January went ?

It's easier for a company with a 3b market cap to double up than a company with a 200b cap. Small caps consistently beat large caps in returns and mid caps slightly outgain small caps (penny stocks are included under "small caps" so that likely hurts their overall numbers. Good small caps generally produce the best returns). I like to look for companies that have a large runway for growth, not companies that have already become massive.

I'm not sure Gamestop will even be a company in 20 years so I havent put much effort into trying to figure out how well they'll perform in the short term.

PLTR I'm bullish on, at least for the next couple years. At that point we'll have to see how they handle slower growth.
That’s what happens when Europoors can’t buy the dip in growth stocks because exchanges are closed
Imagine waiting 80 years instead of going all in on a weekly PLTR call

You're expecting the announcement of TSLA to be included in the S&P prestigious 10 or something to be announced after market today?
You should’ve sold
Call me crazy but the Feb 19th BABA 250c is pretty cheap.
Fuck why did I cover those TSLA puts?
We'll see in an hour if I have a 10 bagger or a classic wsb style expired options.
yea well i live overseas so ot of the loop...so the whole idea that no one has jobs, no one has money, rent is overdue, no food, teeth rotten, kids starving...thats all just bs and really everything is fine peeps just want free $ for gambling? then yea it makes sense
Losing your life savings with no income thanks to a gambling addiction, yep that’s me
Spy 400 feels so close now. Whether its in 2 months or 8 months or whatever 2021 is gonna be sicko mode.
Wow a company not wanting people to feel political pressure while working. What a bad company
Whats a better buy right now PSTH or THCB?
Where are you seeing 178 ?
By the end of the day, looks like gain of 150% for the year (about +340K). This fixes my all-time after many years of losses. Ain't much, but it's honest gains. I traded way too much.

The funny thing is my family thinks I'm down for the year. I won't tell them.
Lol 15k option?!?

Love the effort here but you could have made this better by editing in your own subtitles to tell a more fleshed-out joke.
Shut up poorgot
I sold 2x30c 12/31... i feel bad for you bro you want your premium back?
Other MRNA stocks are like PFE, NVAX and MRNA. That's all I know who used this specific method for the vaccine. The other applications of this tech are ground breaking. Think about AIDS, before we needed to figure out how to actually weaken the virus to vaccinate against it (which we haven't been able to). Now if we use the MRNA tech and make the body think we have already seen it and fought it off, then hypothetically we could vaccinate against AIDS.
Would love to see some old and lame handed 🐻 hazard their necks while jumping out windows to avoid being over-roasted.
I loaded a while back. honestly, I don't know if its a good move at these levels. I think there are a lot of people that think hes going to announce on january first. Wait for that dip when it doesnt happen
Hold the line, tendies arent always on time🎶

You know what’s cooler than being up 105%? Being up 1005%.
Pussy 🧻💩👐 selling out of TSLA
Spot on. Keep seeing this phenomenon occur like clockwork, every time. The same conviction both in jumping on board with the DD after reading roughly two sentences and one 🚀 , and then tearing it down when their retarded OTM weeklies start to bleed.

Its like a case study for mass (retard) psychology.

It's alright GME, you can go back to mooning when you feel like it.
Half regular volume

bruh u fucked up
They seem to be the global leader in EVs outside of tesla. They beat tesla to a cheap sedan, they beat tesla to level four autonomy, they are succeeding at promoting themselves as a lifestyle brand in China and are expanding all over the world. Plus they are on the good side of the CCP for now. Idk what a realistic price target is but if you believe in EVs then you should have no issue believing in NIO.
I think Apple's shit is pretty good, until you factor in the price they charge. Apple's $1000 phones are slightly better than competitor's $300-500 phones; you can roughly double those prices for all the brands' laptops as well. That being said, boomers will continue overpaying for apple for the simple UI and the status symbol, so sure the stock will continue going up.

Go ahead and try to explain to me why their market cap will be less than a trillion dollars when the death cult loses their grip on the world which could be less than 10 years away
Tasers
Already priced in with the recent run up, NIO day was announced a while ago. I'd expect a sell off next week as investors shift from frothy speculative plays like Chinese ev valued at 70B to value stocks. Of course I could be wrong but you're just gambling at this point and if you really have your entire portfolio in it you should have the mindset that you're gambing. I dont know your situation but you should be mentally ready to loose a large percent of that money if you hold. NIO is valued higher than GM, Ferrari, BMW, mcdbnz, Volvo, Honda, double Ford, 5X subaru. This is every car company except tesla Toyota and Volkswagen. Is announcing another sedan really going to push it higher than companies that already sell more cars on the multiple of 1000s? A Chinese one, none the less

Ever had a $5 footlong?
Shares? Ok boomer.
Snow is expecting 100% growth every year for the foreseeable future while PLTR guided to more like 30-40% growth next year. That’s all comes from the management team’s own words.
Deposited $1000 closed the positions and made $60

I’m fucking rich
Anyone here buying any particular tech calls two weeks out? 🤔🤔🤔
My “ research” consists of scrolling Reddit seeing a random ticker symbol and then checking Robin Hood if I can buy it.
Yep. Buying the dip. But keeps dipping lol
Hah, what is Tesla doing? Guys?
Why do WSB praise Bill Ackman? He is just like Martin Shkreli. They literally made us pay more for the health insurance by making drugs at least x50 more expensive. They are both morally corrupted.
Any insight on what the next meme stock will be? I need to start saving up my welfare checks so I can catch the next rocket to the moonbase. I missed the most recent one.

Poor MRNA...from 178 to 103 in just 1 month.
I bouggt corsair at 50 and I've been hating that. Been selling covered calls constantly to eek some money back $50 at a time.

I got into pltr at 22 when it dipped from 30, then doubled my position when it dipped to 26. So this week sucked but I'm not down much overall from PLTR. Godspeed. I'm long on this one just gotta not look so much.
As someone who has broken both their arms at the 14 I can appreciate this comment.
always has been. Reddit is trash
I don’t know if it’s another lock up or issuing more shares, but I keep getting chatter on Jan 7th more will be added to the float.

I actually think V shaped recovery by EOD.  If I'm wrong, that'll suck but we'll see
If I will make 1$ in the stock market in 2021 I will get a Yee Yee Ass Haircut.
Why would you cash out today and be forced to pay the taxes earlier instead of pushing them out? Makes now sense.

Wow I just realized TSLA reached $3500 pre-split today
Revenue per employee is decent at $310k. Contrast with $ZM - $100B @ $245k/employee. PLTR has a much better moat, recurring gov contracts, fewer competitors. This stonk should go up. 

Position: 1800 shares
Its not much but I bought a FD $2.5k TSLA call back during the split day and I made $8k.

I’d give you the science but you don’t even seem to understand debt, financials and speculative science. That said good luck go for it, people are dummies and will probably keep paying well over a fair value. I’ll wait until the first minor article comes out about data that isn’t great because it’s still beyond figured out then grab it 20% lower
Yes bruh...I bought when it was 717
The short answer is that no one knows. They've given multiple answers, warrants could be liquidated and you given the money, they could be only sellable but not buyable, they could be only exercisable. The answer you get depends on the rep who's answering.

There's a ton of effort going into trying to pump PSTH to people who don't understand it on WSB right now and it's kind of gross. Anyone who mentions that you're overpaying for what's essentially $20 cash in escrow per share is downvoted by the pumper clique.

For reals, since people are such binary thinkers.  Not like they are going to scrap the existing grid immediately.  

The rise of decentralized storage also makes long distance transmission more efficient, especially when paired with EV infrastructure rollout along existing road corridors.
Everyone loading up on PSTH
Can we mod this retard?
just bought in at the dip only 20 shares tho.
I've been buying the dip expecting a year-end pump to at least the max pain of $26... very bad end of year for me
That huge dip that makes today's chart look like a giraffe?
Yeah my $X 21c 4/16/21 has been doing absolute shit, wiped out the rest of the steel gains so far.

So what you're saying is... Time to be greedy with PLTR?

I NOT
I still don't know what FD means, and at this point I'm too afraid to ask.
Oh ok I see thanks.
If facing the engine, the leak appears to be on the left hand side of where you add oil. It is a Series 3, 328 i so no turbo.

Told you FD puts on TSLA was the way
It takes 5 fucking seconds of DD to conclude GameStop is shit company, run by completely incompetent idiots, and a brand universally detested by the gaming community at large and anyone who dealt with them.

Their latest scam yet was trolling a bunch of idiots on the internet to pump up their stock before dumping it to pay overdue rent.
You have to say it three times in front of a mirror while holding a piggy bank with monopoly money to make it work tho. Smash that thing and presto now youre not the only thing thats broke!

You all say, “get your money to work for you.” Well, you know what my money did at work today? Lit up some dank weed and told all the customers to fuck off, that’s what it did.
That's what MRNA and PFE use to  make their vaccine's effective. With the old way you actually had to weaken the virus but now if you insert some MRNA that makes your body think you already have the virus making your reaction either nothing not less severe. This means we don't actually have to physically weaken viruses to cure them anymore.
well you got to time the sector rotations... fucking spy will never dip
Kinda hate you for linking that
Depends on if CCP thinks he's useful, if not they'll use the propaganda machine to smear his name first then disappear him.

I don’t mess with options. Not that advanced.  I think 2020 was all about spotting the trends and sentiment.  We are heavy into that right now and I think it continues at least through Q1 2021.
Who are these dealers you’re talking about? I asked my dealer down on the corner about this and he pulled out his gun and told me to fuck off.

Don’t sell now sell at $30
Yo can I get an award too?
If I recall correctly, I think Citron went long $TSLA at ~$300 pre-split. 

They were previously bearish, but flipped bullish (like many other bears) after TSLA lowered its cash burn and mitigated the chances of bankruptcy.
That sounds like a delicious nacho dip 🤤

We just had one in growth names, big tech/mega cap has been fairly flat for months now with the exception of maybe TSLA. I'm not sure we'll see a big drop (greater than 5%) anytime soon across the market

OH FUCK WHY DO I ALWAYS GO IN ON 0DTE TSLA CALLS
I can’t believe the bears STILL HAVE HOPE for a bear market lmfaoo. Literally every good analyst is saying it’s going to be an above average bull year, keep dreaming. If you are a bear this year you have a 95% chance of your account dropping to zero, proceed at your own risk and don’t say you weren’t warned
You have trouble sleeping over shares? The fuck
PLTR is about to get some insane PR before daddy Karp comes on CNBC. Watch it double over night.

I was definitely expecting a 17-18 day today.  Kinda mad about it, actually, because I had a price target on some more April calls that I'm having to adjust upward...but I can't stay mad at our man RC....
Couldn't he just buy puts instead of shorting it to limit the downside?
Who else is buying rn 🥰
He takes money this year, dude. You pay taxes on the gains you made this year- the gains I make this year will go into my 2020 tax filing, and Papa Biden will take my money.

Roth IRA grows tax free, so there are no taxes on the gains I make there, and no taxes when I withdraw. So a higher risk strategy is reasonable in the roth since massive gains would be untaxed.

Just going to point something out and allow you to interpret how you want
When gamma is as high as it is dealers have to cover short calls with shares
Once the market turns there is less risk of being assigned, allowing the dealer to risk off and sell shares
There is the lowest SPY short interest since Jan of last year
There is nobody covering their shorts on the way down now that there is no one short the market
When/If a selloff begins, it will accelerate at an insanely fast pace because there are no shorts buying back and there is an insane amount of call sellers de-risking
Let us go!!
Then don't delete it. Keep it up.
Pleas die again
People questioning why PLTR is dropping but didn't question it when it ran over 200% in under a month.
Yes you can see option volume and open interest on any brokerage platform.
7 layer dip
When might we see a pull back in the market? Not a 🌈🐻, just waiting for the dip
Bro it’s going to be a bull year ever good analyst sees it to, go fuck off till we need a correction

Of course the 🐝 is taking flight, just yesterday i moved out of it and into $OVER90PERCENTPEACEFULPROTESTS
Honestly I did that at first and was like wtf is this. Then I searched it again because I knew the company name.

Yeah I did this with SQ 1/15 215c yesterday. Sold the 230c and this really worked out well.
How do you think he went to 100k in the first place 🌚
Don’t be a pussy
How did that BB call work out for you?
Because it is a $10 stock
Is Mayweather broke already?
X is a piece of shit man, I took my profits but let the rest ride, and it looks like I might be net 0 on the trade. Every day I look at it and feel sad about it, do something you idiot...
How do you know what a stock should be worth?  Aren’t we all just guessing?

Uh I was down $400 now it's $300 ish. Finally stopped chasing scraps and looking for plays. Doesn't bother me if I dont make a play during the day.

Citron is shorting it 🌈🐻
Bfgc looks fun
Are you sure about the maths on that? It seems insane and using a compound interest calculator it only said 90k

5% return takes 52 years to 10x an investment, and your only putting 48k into it so idk how it gets to 500k in 20 years
it's probably gonna reach 20 and beyond lmao there's still time i guess
Tell us more
Watching the Power Rangers Movie? You are autistic.
How does one become so retarded
It’s always funny when people post solid dd, tell everyone to buy far out calls while their cheap. Then everyone goes out and buys tons of weeklies, and calls it a bust when it doesn’t pan out immediately
Are we really gunna end this year with a red day? This market deserves more
hopefully these dips stay on for couple more days. I need those 25c for 2022.
I'm about to do the same. Gotta average down to make myself feel better lol.
The problem is, PLTR was never worth over $20 to begin with.

All you retards just pumped it way too hard in the fall.
Made $60 just now what color lambo am I getting
Not if it’s something special

I haven’t done DD myself, but I’ve read a few here and there. It appears to be cheap rn. Maybe a good buy. But yeah I bagheld from 10 to 21 to 15 lol. Obviously do DD. There’s legit great companies going public thru SPACs.
So next week lulu reverses and shoots to the moon right?
Learned the Theta way to take advantage of this deadass flat day ..staying even on a day like this is good IMO lol
Haha I did the funny pls award

lmao, buy an overvalued company that has another 3-4 years until anything is commercially available if you are lucky. all genomic companies will drop 20-30% before they have any considerable climb. that is all I trade and have since 2016 but go ahead, buy your calls lmao. That said I entered CRSP at 20 a share, NTLA at 9 a share and EDIT at 18 a share
Bought 3k more in ICLN today. Gonna blow up next year even more.

Cash out to do what? None of this is life changing money. The guy that made 20m off Tesla options...thats when you cash out.
better to just wait for 2k trump bucks to 200% of your account

Sometime in mid February
Then definitely take a break. You will see better days. Don't compound mistakes.
Is NIO day already fully priced in?
Goddamit
alright man i’ve got 200 shares of pltr at 22.76, thinking about selling half and putting it into apple, thoughts? having trouble sleeping atm
Hope you get another dip. I sold puts at 35 for jan im up a few hundo and have like 108 shares. Not a big position but 5k is a lot for a conservative guy like me with a ring on his mind :]
all my profits this year lost this last week lmao
lmao nice
how do you think they make money
I just woke up wtf is going on
[removed]
We never left u paper hand fgt =)
I live in CA. I’m currently paying about 50% on ST cap gains and 33% on LT cap gains. My investing friends are in the same boat, generating millions in tax liability each year. Proposed tax plans would drastically increase our tax rates, add trading fees, implement asset taxes, etc. 

A lot of countries in Asia have 0% cap gains tax rates. Most importantly, they view us as solutions and contributors. It feels like we get a lot of hostility here, while getting shafted with tax bills. Our money will land in FUTU.
Weeeeeeeeee, we're on  A woket
Hold them tightly fellas. 😀
PLTR is super cheap now
No worries, all of it is in stocks, not options, just gotta stay calm 🥴

Don't be surprised to see ARKG drop to mid 80s. Game changing tech that is not profitable yet tends to have these boom & bust cycles (like fuel cells before this year)

Nothing left to roast.

I’ve been trading CRSR between $30-40 and PLTR between $20-30

Does anyone realistically see NIO hitting 70+ by 2022? Really tempted to take a LEAP of faith
Hey thanks for linking my tweet. I hope we see a 13D next week to confirm what I said. 19 support right now looking good so far, I really was expecting 17-18 lows cause of Melvin attack. If we survive the onslaught of 19 it really might be because of RC.
Same
Whats pumping SPY!?
ye I mean it's a great idea. I just didn't read you. I'm just trying to find other dd during these mega dips.
Down 11.4k being a gay bear & betting against TSLA couple of times. Never bet against Papa Musk.

Don't trip at all the negative comments OP, they don't understand the depth of addiction.

I work an hourly wage job as well and was in a very similar boat as you about 6 months ago. Went from $900 to a $54k in Poker & Blackjack in a span of about a month. Best run of my life obviously, but as a true degenerate gambler, you think you can keep doing it and I not only went busto, but dug myself a deeper hole by borrowing $5k to keep gambling.

You'll drive yourself into depression and stress constantly thinking about it, you just have to accept your mistakes and learn from it by reminding yourself of the pain and staying away from it. Either that or learn to walk away with profits, but being a true degenerate myself, I know I not able to stop once I start.

I wish you the best, OP

Who’s still holding pltr?
Checked the ticker price and realized my wife’s boyfriend hasn’t given me enough peanuts to sell that option.
CRM dumps with SPY but doesn't pump with it. POS.
I was just thinking this. This retard almost ended up owning a tax bill on 6 figure capital gains with none of the gains to pay it off.
trueee imagine if he lost it all tomorrow instead.
[hehe](https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/285875.jpg?resize=640%2C432)
Not sure. Maybe sell a little bit of whichever stock you're up the most on.
Another mysterious SPY pump where we have no idea what of the actual components are driving this rally...

Wow SPY very legal
Maybe it's because I've gotten into a lot of scraps over the years but the big guy usually wins just because he's got 80 more lbs rooted to the ground behind his punches. He's also old as shit now. People overestimate the objective durability of small professional fighters all the time. They seem larger than life on TV. Their bodies still follow the same rules as everyone else's though.
DASH all over the fucking map today

GME run back ! Buy the dip !
I’ve got 27’s for the same day
It's the fuckin Catalina SPY mixer
I think they’re ahead with regulatory approvaks
Now that the general sentiment on here is anti PLTR, I think I'll get in. As soon as buying calls is considered inverting WBS, you gotta do it right?

This year’s a W for me
Pretty sure if he bought in at 6 and held at 13$ post earnings dip while you told him he was a retard...

That you are the actual retard.
Aaaanndddd TSLA is fine
Strong support at 23. Fibonacci sez so.
omg buy the dips guys!!!! where are all the retards bulls gone to?
Such a retard for realizing gains and letting the losses roll to next year

Good call bc I feel like it’ll end flat to fuck both of us over

“But you haven’t seen PLTR at it’s best”
Buying 250 shares of the PLTR dip hope it goes back up
what in the fuck is going on lmao

I find myself asking this quite often with this retarded market 🚀🤣
Everybody follow RC on Twitter, tell everyone to follow him.
Further, if you can confirm you're losing oil that fast (the oil reminder came on, because there's no dipstick on those) and have smoke then it would have to be a turbo feed or drain line.
Its beautiful...GME 🚀🚀
Want to sell OTM puts on DASH but I definitely don't want to be holding that POS just in case it drops. $140 seems like a floor though.
Just dont.

Holy shit. Tesla dying. GET OUT!
Yeah i mean thats the key. So he sold airlines at the bottom. But lets say had he kept them he would have made 10x his money. But instead when he sold the airlines, he invested in bank of america at $3 a share and sold it at $30. Then he came out even. Or maybe he put it into a different company that made 20x. It doesnt really matter that he sold airlines at the bottom, just as long as he put it into something else that mooned
Added 100 more shares cause its the end of the year! 🚀
About to save $3k next year with these PLTR capital losses 🙏🏼🙏🏼🙏🏼
Once in a daytime opportunity! Get in now before the end of year sell-off!
No I’ve made many bad trades before
Settle down Eric Cartman

How retarded would it be to leave my -70% 1/15/21 calls ( PLTR CARR PYPL) open? Waiting on that famed January pump...
Heh, ok. During the most unstable geopolitical times since the 80s. I come from actual money, don’t have to pretend like you kid. Gyna and semiconductors are where we’re going.
have you seen goev?
one would be insane to think TSLA isn't going to POP back up EOD
SPY going crazy
I mean I’ve blown almost all of my savings and don’t really have much of an income so this sucks, at least my family and gf think I’ve got money and my college is free
23-25 is reasonable. Really hoping for 25 before the 29th lol

Psth is steadily rising every day as more and more buyers position themselves for a q1 2021 merger announcement. 

I beg of you all to at least make an attempt to understand the tontine structure, and consider that although merger target announcement may give this a 10-50% boost, the run up to the warrant transfer will be historic. Everyone will be in a frenzy to get shares, and nobody will want to sell and pass up their monetary handout.

What does that even mean? I have @24.8 and was thinking of doubling down but not sure if it's a good idea.
CRM will recover big time, though - imo
Dude I like to spread that shit out. Right now I have 1 each at 25 30 35 40. Im going to see what happens next week and decide what to do, but if I put more into GOEV it will likely be shares.

430k+ in short term gains from selling weekly spreads.

Account went from 200k -> 540k yesterday, but i also have withdrawn 300k to buy a house etc.  I included the wire xfer for the largest portion (220K) so that's why you'll see a drawdown in June
i prefer FUBU
Well I was speaking more to how it dropped a 1% in about 30 mins :(

Buying the **GME QQQJ ICLN** \+ weed dip = 😎💎📈🚀🌕🏝️🍑🍆💦
Got mine today. Credit unions FTW
they thot they did something with that statement 🥴
I wish more people would talk about my huge tendies. My eTrade app certainly isn't.
I trade on ameritrade and it’s on that. Not sure about other platforms though
No but people might chuck that money into TSLA stock or calls
Home Depot you absolute worthless piece of garbage shit I hate you
[removed]
Buy the dip
Retarcules.
30 seconds amusement? You mean you only watched this once?!
So what in the ever loving fuck is actually causing this dip? Blocked stimmy? Dems winning Georgia? New strain of CV in the US? tax loss selling? all of the above? fuck me a whole week of red.
no administration of either party has ever reduced surveillance or 'national security' spending. and white obama wont change that
It’s the WSB way to be in shambles when all indices are green
I scrolled through these, and I agree
Thanks ❤️

To The one who bought my 12/31 715c today for $4.5, I am sorry for you my friend
What are you looking at ? Like a good time to buy some more? Lol today sucked thus far
It’s ok no hard feelings thx ❤️
Stocks only go up. Even when they go down. EV and genomics seem to be the big plays next year.
its the normal time. 2 is for bonds
anyone got their stimmies?

i am still waiting for mine 😥
yeah I mean at those prices.... it's just too good... I bought earlier and didn't leave some extra cash around... fuck me... the worst part about dips is when you cannot take advantage of them.
Pack your bags son, I just lost the house
This is great DD
I thought their parameters all seemed weird.   It didn’t ask super important questions related to people interested in trading, like spouses, children, liquidity situations, etc. Also, the careers question was phrased like it was someone who’s never actually worked at a place of business in a professional setting.   I don’t know what the hell kind of information these guys are going to get out of such a poor survey.
Close bond market forever. Stocks go up
Oh man, nice! You selling any cc's or just holding and banking on this one really taking off?
You’re retarded you should be buying stuff now
But what if he loses his money? Is it worth the risk.

When Ryan Cohen officially makes his move for GME, how many whales/funds watching from the sidelines gain the confidence to jump in?
Just bought 200 more GME @ $19.05 averaged down to $19.34 cost. Ready for the MOASS
this makes bag holding gme a bit easier after this week
We could at least get a pump into close... maybe?
\+30$
GME is fuk
I paid an expensive paperhanding lesson on Tesla. Bout after the split and pussed out when it “crashed” into the $300’s low $400s for a month. Decided I learned my lesson and bought heavy into PLTR. I am not fucking selling even if there’s a fire. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🥲

Yeah and the rocket ship is a squeeze bottle of honey mustard
My DD says this company is a long-term solid investment.  The options selling I do is just to cut my cost basis down and generate income too.
They are seriously making sure SPY ends at record high for end of year lol.

Alright!
Is there a better way to enter 2021?

TSLA FD’S NOW
In FUBO long. Lets goo
PLTR fucked so many of us lol
I feel attacked
*makes PLTR noises*
I would start with selling puts unless you are crazy bullish. MSFT, V, TTWO
Tesla has put in a lot of work this year, he deserves to take off a little early if that's what he wants.
Check for yourself 💁🏽
Hi God it’s me again
Several inches to go son, just hold steady mmkay ..
Duuuuude, dollar cost average that shit in man. Spread that buy over at least a month. Don't just buy it all at once
back to normal now I guess.

There’s probably more securities insuring the market than securities in the market

Same. Thank God I only got in today and for Jan eom expiry
This game is a mind fuck. Smart to take a breather.
So TSLA is "holding SPY up" earlier and it's basically flat...

TSLA gives back some of it's gains and SPY rockets? Rightttttt...
How are you so bad at googling???
Paper handed a call earlier, but still kept diamond hands on one. Both at a lil loss tho lmao
I'm getting absolutely ass blasted today.
Winning in tsla puts and losing in spy puts im so conflicted
Good job TSLA retards. Y'all fucked up today
Could we add PLTR back to the $hit stock list, please. Thank you.
Imagine spending that $140 on 100 $20 calls back then. Sorry I ruined your day..
buy stock. prevents people from shorting your shares, less shares in circulation.
His name is Ryan Cohen! #wewantcohen
Imo robinhood was better for options if you’re a beginner like me but Webull has more technical stuff if you understand it all
lmao. None existent, we canadians think we're just better than the US. FACZ...

tho I'm not complaining about canada nor the US. I love both countries, but if we're talking about making huge tendies, definitely US is better. I mean we don't even have good trading platforms like you guys do... but the healthcare and stuffs are certainly nice... extremely slow but you just have to do with it.

It's a balancing act.
If ARKG doesn't moon next month then my anal cavity is public domain

Thanks a lot man I appreciate it. My shitty week is more about work than the market. I work in sales and it’s our slow season but upper management doesn’t understand or give a shit you that it’s slow season and there’s an ongoing pandemic keeping people from wanting to spend money. Either way, just high pressure sales and mentally exhausting.
Thanks for this! Been looking for something new that has a lot of room to grow
I caught Fuse today at 11.13!

 Bought tsla before close yesterday, closed it today at 711 got scared. 709 now feels alright
Something's fucky
Can confirm 

Held weeklies, had nightmares
A meme
It was retarded, but that wasn't what I was talking about his lottery ticket paid off and he is in tendy town. I was talking about him saying bear plays can't  make money in a year where oil futures went negative. I was saying I wasn't retarded enough to short the collective stupidity of this sub.
MU hasn't paid a dividend since Clinton was in office
Man Roku is straight fucking me lol
clown the only thing making sense in this tl;dr
You know when people say % instead of $ it ain’t much
Well TSLA just shit the bed; was fun while it lasted :P
I’m officially all in on GME now. Now I just wait
It's just COPING. Let them COPE in peace plz.
Well in all seriousness, that's about what 95% of us do. Just take a break and clear your head.

Good day for PSTH. Really wish I had bought more march calls.

Don’t tell me you bought TSLA calls after a 10% run in 3 days.
This is the way.

Is this the way,

The way this is?
Welp TSLA GUH’ed me lost all my gains from today.
Or donate to my dumb ass so I can make gains in 2021 lol $mondatta
You should be, the valuation for NIO is trash. Why didn't you do it when the stock was 40 2 weeks ago? All you're doing is FOMOing at the top
"below where you add oil" what side? Exhaust manifold/valve cover area or around the oil filter housing? The oil filter housing gasket is a common problem. If there's smoke that's usually the valve cover gasket, very common on BMW's in general. Not too hard of a job, i would tackle it yourself. 2013 still fairly new, maybe you blew one of the turbo's, which is common on those as well. 335i? You should be able to see the turbo's from the bottom easier, lift it in the air and take off the belly pans/covers, once those are off you can see if it's a turbo feed or drain.
Pltr slipping it in no lube rn
Truer words have never been spoken. I was gonna dump some money in it today. Looks like it’s gonna keep bleeding though.

Hey that’s me
What’s the realistic target price you have for GME in January yall
Cheers to 2021, so glad I'm starting the year getting violently gorilla fucked by PLTR.
The cgi is atrocious in the last 30 minutes, but the movie is still surprisingly solid.  Ivan Ooze is a great villain, and the movie is just fun.
Look at what happened to FUBO simply from lock period ending
I have no intentions of reacting to any movements in my positions, or enter any new trades, so why do I still refresh every 10 mins? New plan, log in Monday’s, sell way OTM weekly covered calls, log out until the next week.
My hedge puts for my shares are ITM. It's a great little balancing act of staying even.
Tesla going red do it baby!
lmfao 3% off of ATH.... please shut up dude.
Another $1k today. Right at 500 shares

Dividend stocks are for people in their 50s. The age where you have a somewhat massive portfolio balance and you'd rather not take as much risk, while at the same time receiving regular large dividend payments to supplement income. We're talking $200k+ portfolios. Enough that the dividends can nearly support you.
I mean I admit, I just got lucky. Just got home and was like, wtf is TSLA ripping for yet again. Especially when everything else is red pretty much. 

Bought it right at the day's top and sold for a almost 40% profit a few minutes ago.
I was watching the chart and was so happy it went my way, then i saw my position -4 instead of 4, sucks so much
Loaded to the tits on 29c 1/15 today
Already in that heavy spac-bro. I have 2500 commons @12.00 cost basis
They did, but I sat on them and snap dropped, so instead of getting 8k, I got like 2k which wasn’t enough to balance the losses from GME tanking day 1
Manipulation bro
If you don’t see the fact that Monday is going to be big green along with all of January you’re officially a 🤡 this whole month has been a bunch of shit because everyone thinks they are big brain for getting out of the market early in December instead of dumping all at once. Bull run starts January get ready folks I would be buying today not selling

I’d never suggest such a retarded thing lol
[deleted]
Unless GME bounces to 20 and Nio to 51 in the next 30 mins, GG
What plays? I want to do opposite of you
so they why tesla go up?
Ayyyeee no taxes good plays retard
I was getting nervous there for a little while
Imagine selling? That’s how you stay poor
PLTR weekly chart is what nightmares are made of
Spy inversing Tesla
Imagine calling $2k stimulus checks "socialism for the rich" when the cap is $150k for married couples. As if ~75k a person a year is considered rich when moscow mitch and his GOP cronies handed out billions in tax cuts to the truly rich (aka his donors).
I’d like to thank 2020 for giving me one last ‘fuck you’ today. Ugh.
It’s at 709. People keep fucking selling !! Just hold !
... and SO DO IIIIIIII

new to trading. here's what I've learned. when I buy stocks, they go down.
You still have got miles to go before you become a shining star of this retard-verse.

As to who is the reigning king, check this out:

Pltr be like 💀💀
ARKs are dipping hard, where have you been
It's 4d chess as they say?
Nice AAPL recovery.  Whew!
It’s still cheap
Green energy, pot, idk what else up, defense sector and probably manufacturing down
RemindMe! 1 year
Oh shit I just realized ARKK just got weekly options
Aim for 10% a month
This is fucking incredible, just like that movie.

*Come on and take a freeee ride*
I literally kept that in the back of my head wearing my 🤡 ass 🌈🐻 suit... markets just say stack the bodies and 🚀🚀🚀🚀

EDIT: burned my 🌈🐻 suit and bull gang now (with a hedge to SPXS)

Some we can agree some autist MM are manipulating GME every time it hits $20? Because all these $20 slap downs can't be a coincidence
Rkt
How tf is SPY mooning when almost every stonk I have is tanking?

Bro did you not see the sell off that was continuous since Black Friday? We blasting off it’s not even a question
Good enough.
Whats savings?
Time to load up on gold miners
The only thing that makes vaccine stocks a decent long term play is the Messenger RNA tech.... They finna produce a lot of drugs with that shit in the future
Haha. He won 2020
Go deep OTM calls on ROPE.
Pltr is the clearest bear chart I've ever seen
Look at this manipulation, SEC 404 not found
Next time just give it to me SMH
Buy the Tesla dip
Going out of 2020 with a bang. I like your style 📈

I figured people drank more Coronas than that. I think it taste like piss. I like IPA’s myself.
what is
Bought 1x $105c 19 mar 21

If they go down further I’ll likely buy another
Fuck all of yall being rude. Bitch OP saw twice in his life 10000% returns that's more dick than most of you pussyfarts can claim. OP you young, dont hit yourself, just hold these horses.
I can’t quit it’s addictive
Let’s gooooo
Wtf I thought market closed at 2 today???
no kidding, holy shit
CAN go tits up
I assumed you were telling people to sell naked (call) LEAPS on pltr...which would be a very WSB thing to do. lol
#POSTURE AND HYDRATION PEOPLE! No one wants the HUNCHBACK OF NOTRE DAME regardless of your  LARGE quantities of tendies!

mm done harvesting losses  

we going up from here
1. Nobody knows.

2. 2021 shouldn't be fundamentally different than 2020.

3. Nobody knows but I'm predicting a green Monday.

Oh was it? So I'm just retarded then, okay.

Edit: so I'm only half retarded. Dec 29 last day for Canada, Dec 31 last day for USA.
This might be the lowest you’ll see apple for a while. Every bull case on apple has been blown out of the water with more bullish news. All new products will be in Q1 earnings. And the price will only go up Bc everyone is done tax loss farming. Get in apple. February calls are cheap
fk outta here; we're not that autistic

Those Wendy’s paychecks coming through
Yeah, but iv can fall off a cliff once the underlying gets to where it's suppose to be.  Silver at 30 would be slv around 28 still.    I think you'd have better luck with a 28 or get 26 and sell 30s.

Tsla deliveries/earnings months in january.
oh boy, what a big mistake
Down 15k in the past 2 weeks, think it’s time to get off and clear my head rip
Positions
This is actually a HUGE shitpost opportunity to - SCROLL PAST
What the fucking fuck is up with Velodyne? Just a joke of a stock or has it not found it’s true value yet? After every positive day there’s a fucking monster sell off. It’s probably cucks just scalping it for short term profits. And here I am thinking they have a legit game changer technology that could anchor an industry in the next five years
Nio give me one more sloppy blowjob powerhour for 2020!!!! Make my pussy tingle!!!
Good job. Never hurts to sell some. 33% ? 50% ? You're going to have to exit the position eventually.
[deleted]
If that helps you

No matter how big my bank account is, at least I won't get executed by the police for no reason. lol!
Bond market closed at 2pm, right as SPY jumped. Coincidence?
Apparently I own nothing in SPY
All that DD and didn’t learn that TSLA isn’t a car company
This is like watching fat gross girl porn
400%!

I’m hoping to roll them out to June on the next dip again
I meant 3230 (edited). Agree. Bring May back.
Dis will be a $230 stock by 2023
lul but we're in this together! I have hopes!
Easier to make 1mil from 100k than from 2k
Yeah, I guess if he fights Lennox sure, but some random bloke who doesn’t know how to fight and is just “big?”  No.
🐝 looking good
What is happening to Thicc 🐝
You’re a huge pussy!
Bird up let's defund the military
Iron ore up 95% for the year 👀
Good call
This is great!!!
I smell a bazooka
Am I too late for the awards? :(
THCB vertical still
How much to recover from back to back -20% days?
Santana Row
SPY ABOUT TO SELL OFF!!!!! BE READY.
Ok enjoy the free fall 🤘🏻
Ok sure, but a near 50% drop?! It's trading at the same level as a few pre-DA spacs......

It's trading lower than NKLA!!
\-90%
Ooooo oooo oooo do 99.99% loss and what it takes
Funny because ARKG is currently murdering my portfolio with a sword.
what if TSLA does another %700 gain in 2021?
[deleted]
Unclear why setting a reminder literally for me to come back to let you know the outcome makes me retarded.

I made no prediction lol

My strangle doesn’t love to see it 😂🤦🏻‍♂️
I live in Canada, You burger.
I did the survey.   
Why wasn't there a show results option at the end?
MSFT hacked again? Or you mean was hacked by Russia. Is this new?

Isn’t that only when you sell? He never actually had that money.

Odds this shits the bed monday? Or we blasting off into the new year
Anyone who put their $600 stimulus in SPY calls now has $2000. Congratulations.
Nice Spot to get in GME for EOD
Right on! Good luck to us both!
Buy AMZN dip or not?!!
🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝🐝
Let the tendies hit the floor!!!!
You can’t recover from being a retard
Nice.
Palantir is probably analyzing yo whole shit right now nigga
And what a great year 2008 was for stocks.......
someone should prolapse mitch mcconells asshole
ICLN gonna end the day green

Baba for sure
I also noticed that most people here eat too many processed foods, especially chicken nuggets. I think those should be maybe 5% of your diet. Try to eat more organic, Whole Foods, and lean meats. You should have plenty of vegetables with each meal, and hydrate with water-Sugary drinks can cause you huge energy crashes and leave your brain too fatigued to make wise choices in the stock market. Oky doky now
My dumbass should’ve given that free silver to this post..
I keep mistaken buying with selling and selling with buying, lost a thousand bucks today just because of this fuck
You set a shining example for the little ones here. Pleas fly again you beautiful eagle.
whatsup bee? whats the catalyst for the sudden move up on this glorious red fucking day? can you share your trick with that fucker named pltr?
Is snow roach gonna cry. By the way you stupid ass mullet wearing white boy we all evolved from apes. So that means you too Mayo monkey 🦧🥚
FUBO

Oil prolly superfucked. Renewables gonna make lots of overnight millionaires.

Covered my TESLA puts a little early.
AMD finally waking up lol
[deleted]
Dunno but it’s doing it without FANG so I don’t trust it.  Probably fund managers trying to pump before close so they can get their bonuses.
**Friendly reminder.**


It takes an 11% gain to recover a 10% loss.

It takes a 25% gain to recover a 20% loss. 

It takes a 43% gain to recover a 30% loss.  

It takes a 67% gain to recover a 40% loss.

It takes a 100% gain to recover a 50% loss. 

It takes a 300% gain to recover a 75% loss. 

What does it take to recover from being a retard?
[deleted]
Lmao 1st gold and it didn't even pass a minute
None right now that I am as high conviction about for the long term. I was considering some SPACs that are close to their net asset value as an asymmetrical bet. 

I have long term confidence in UNM though. I think by mid 2021 they will increase they dividend and resume share buybacks

Their reinsurance deal with General Atlantic will hopefully remove the narrative overhang about the LTC block analysts focus on

Stocks like UNM are what I am trying to use to become financially independent based on the dividends
Damn you good then.

I thought it was going to trade flat around 220 for a while so I didn’t buy.
You would rather be Jethero than Jigga?
Don’t! Its a shitty company with an awful balance sheet
Somehow you retards convinced me to buy GME calls when it hit $19.

ALL ABOARD THE AUTIST TRAIN

CHOO CHOO
Yo how much % profits is the goal for 2021? Realistic if possible
BAIDU BABA NIO all good to roll right now
A company that’s been around forever and is becoming less and less utilized or a company that has a big future ahead of them and in the middle of a big dip... PLTR 🚀
Not for the U.S that was Canada , you can simply look up last day for tax loss-selling us and find it
You clearly don't know about fighting then. I'm not saying box him and have him pay you off to lose. I'm saying someone that much bigger than him is just physically too much for him to handle. Don't fanboy with me retard
Unironically, yes
Big gay retard, ban
Most definitely.
look at pltr's 1 day chart. lower highs and lower lows
Palantir?
Worst stocks the past month: CRM and PLTR. Change my mind
Ole Mitch shot down $2000 stimmy again, and there goes Tesla off a cliff. Thanks Turtle Man.
A bit overkill but I’m with you lol 💎✊🚀
Boom, roasted!
Happy almost new year y'all
Thicc bitch blasting
100k is a nice round figure to shoot for though. Once you have that you can simply invest in index funds for at least 20 years and retire to a lavish lifestyle (as long as you can keep yourself from dipping into those funds until you're ready to retire).
OTM BABA calls 1/8
MRNA getting its ass beat the fuck down - I'm guessing ppl are starting to price in the other vaccines getting approved soon.
You are a real piece of shit
❤️ TLRY ❤️
Before merger rumored for q1? Why? Just bc new ath?
5. Wife how much??
Now in short squeeze, float stops churning

Ashes where short bodies burning

No more gay bears have the power

GME has struck the hour


Day of judgement, Ryan's calling

On their knees, Melvin crawling

Begging mercy for their sins

Autists laughing, spreads their wings

Oh lord, yeah!
Ass can be built. You’ll get over the small tits
GME keeps bouncing off $19. You love to see it.
Is this even legal?
Yep
🚨BOOMER ALERT 🚨
Ok so Mitch just definitely lost the senate for the republicans. What does a dem senate and Biden together mean for the market? Are we going down?
GNUS
You're fucking retarded.....that's all
[removed]
You called it. JP Morgan and Wedbush both just released bullish outlook on AAPL. They give outperform 150-160 price targets. January is going to be a big month for Apple.
Palantir this Palantir that STFU
You think you’re hot shit just cause you know words
split 1 to 100, I am sure the masses will buy in more at 7 dollars a share. People will most likely spend 700 to buy 100 shares of something than spend 700 to buy 1 share.
I would like to see a show of hands of who bought TSLA FD calls right before that drop
Robin Hood has a feature that shows you the nearest railroad station when -100k+.  You don’t have much further til you unlock it.
Last date for tax harvest was 29 December
AAPL spiked news of strong iPhone sales. AAPL dropped back down but SPY stayed up.
Lmao 😂 was joking about the r/dividends thing. Congrats retard
I just hope we have a small run up till earnings and that IV increases 35% is insanely low
Why is snowflake dropping?
Its wiggly
Buy BABA calls before close. Will rip next week. Way oversold.
It's day 9 for GOEV, maybe "never go up ever" is a tad premature.
I did
If your call debit spread risk/reward is 1:1, you're doing them incredibly wrong and you should be writing that premium, not buying. I like debit spreads when I can find them around 1:10 or so (ie max loss $10 max gain $100).

I find even then it's still difficult to hit max gain because they have to be above your short strike at expiration, and I usually don't hold them that long.

I'm slowly starting to realize that IV and DTE are probably the biggest factors for success in premium buying. Cutting winners at 50% is a good strategy if you don't have any thesis you're following, and it's easier to do that if you just buy naked premium.
gme is going to squeeze to apples market cap /s
The reason it "mostly follows the real stock" is because PRYMY is an "American Depository Receipt", which is a receipt issued on an American exchange that is a placeholder for a foreign stock. NIO, for instance, is an ADR. It is likely possible for you to buy the Italian stock itself, but that requires a bit more effort than simply buying the ADR.
Because dems will never allow that. They are bought out by big tech
If I’ve said it once I’ve said it a million times: lmao fuck
I have. This is what I’m still holding into the pending correction.
Loading up puts.
i think u replied to the wrong comment lmfao i saw the comment ur talking about tho
It’s mooning, just in the wrong direction
Already did, but it's no problem, stonks only go up.
[deleted]
IS THE SHIT ON MY FACE ELIGIBLE FOR TAX WRITE OFF?
TSLA giving yall change to buy the dip quick
it's ok weed stonks, I know you'll get higher later 📈
F off
Can the algos just buy like crazy into the close so I can sell some things ?
98.6% thanks to TSLA would've been like 150% if I didn't go full retard on the various meme shit this year
Ahh I see, I see those come up on the sub all the time but not personally interested. I currently only have GME dicking me down but NIO/PSTH/VALE has been saving the GME losses 💀
Based on the breakeven looks like they were $700
If you didn't buy TSLA puts when it hit $718, you hate money.
With that attitude you wouldn’t have made it in the first place. Enjoy your GE dividends bruh
Hopefully this isn't an outlier like 14-15. Need steeldaddy to give us an update.
I used to get scared when the price point fell below my dollar cost average, now I just buy more. I don't give a fuck if it goes to zero, I'm not fucking selling until I see a short squeeze 🚀🚀🚀

Oh no so much money
I guess all the sellers finished selling and logged off for NYE, only buyers remain.
And that's not a knock against black people, mind you, it's a knock against how shitty it is to be black in America.
AAL leaps anyone?
Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

What times does the market close today?
please dont jinx, i dont want this to dump yet
[deleted]
It hit my buy in an hour ago. I set it 4 days ago. Yep it’s moving like it should.
I never want to hear the words Santa Claus Rally again
Yes as long as it’s past the “ex dividend “ date from my understanding
Yep. Waiting sucks, but I'll be sitting on a Tendie Throne at the end of it
If AMZN drops below 3230 I’m doubling down. I think earnings will be a wake up call
someone tell me why TLRY is a bad investment
Profit good
You are an inspiration to all

Anyone that has flair, that’s how they earned it.

up 34% , just sitting here eating paint chips...
As long as it’s past ex-div date.
MSFT hacked..... 

$ZS will be $500 by 2022 calling it now and also going in with 10k
Holy fuk all PLTR retards are ded. It's hilariois but not surprising that most people here bought 12/31 calls
chill guys, you are all autists, i respect that, but just don't touch your positions, no volume anywhere, market manipulated these hours, be strong. BUT if you have today expiration option - RIP, see you in Valhalla
did someone push tsla off the cliff or smt?
Why are TSLA bulls so arrogant when practically every growth stock is up massively in the past 3 months? ROKU, CRSP, CHWY, LMND are all up just as much or more than TSLA. Even DIS is up 45%.

How old are you? 19?

cronos is such a fucking shit stock weed is such a dead industry
Perfectly timed bottom. Put down some 8800 on a Dec 2022 Call 12/21/22. Was selling for 5.85. It's roughly 60 rn.
Expecting GME to pop back up to $20 next week
The TD accounts are prettier. I think I’m up 1,500% YTD on most of those.
I let my NET option exercise and am holding some of those. I have about 5 shares of AMZN and I'm more bullish about them then basically any company. Holding WORK until the sale finalizes at which point I'm likely to hold CRM. And then GOOG. Wish I had held my AAPL and FB though. Mostly big tech, which, unless eviscerated by antitrust, will always be able to scale faster harder and more profitably than any other business. And as much as I love TSLA and regret sharing my shares, I feel like they're insanely overvalued. But if they leverage some of the capital from their $5B round and maybe do another, they can really fuel some interesting revelatory growth. Or they could do something insane like acquire F or someone else. Don't think I see that happening though.
Big tech isn’t just going to sit there and take it. They have the most powerful lobbyists
I managed to hold my GME calls holy shit. Hopefully Monday looks good with stimulus checks.

Well at the End of the day you only lost 2k.
[deleted]
thats what i was looking at
[deleted]
Sure would love it if I got my first ever reward here
It’s crazy how you can literally see the panic on the Tesla charts haha
Looks like I called it perfectly
Ive bet bigger on less lets do this my fellow autists
I'm sure you're hurting right now. I just wanted to thank you so much for sharing this, it's posts like these that help to counter-balance the euphoria around here, and prevent 1000s more young men from losing their life savings to high-risk options gambles. You're doing a good thing here, and I hope you learn from your mistakes
Nvm u got no gf
Not that it matters but 3700 was the daily corona toll in the US
Mods ban
What's propping up dash?
Was there a rotation from TSLA to SPY? wtf
I’m going to try and wait this one out with them. I think it’s fear driving me to sell or buy more but will give it six more months
Look at FUBO after lockup expiry and 3x float...

Now imagine PLTR after lockup expiry and 5x float...

Next catalyst is straight down lmao
Do you guys have anymore hope left for PLTR?
[deleted]
Right choice.

Regards,
Not Grandpa.
Market wants certainty. Will moon either way.
is PLTR up or down on monday open ? about to say fuck it and go all in for new years
Think the shorts are going to try to shake the GME gang EOD. Think we are asleep at the wheel or already drinking.
Did you rotate from TSLA to PLTR?
You better be right
25
I told y’all Tesla 700P 01/08 was free money. And y’all were like nah, gay bear and downvoted.
If you don't believe me, watch the institutions buy up your shares and your gfs after hour today
I'm loading up on SPY calls for Monday. No way we tank on the first day back of 2021
I would pay Sofia Vergara to let me lick her shit off the ground
Actually it's DPhil at oxford
Buy the dip shit
Hmmmm maybe he's just as autistic as us.
What stock should I scoop to sell covered calls on
No
Did it ever hit $40vv
There is a CUM ticker lol
PLTR making new day lows all day long. WHAT A FUKKIN CHAMP
*Tesla dumpin*

SPY: nah I like it up here, nice view
Bullish. Higher margins. It’s proven fir ages that slight scale back on portions while retaining price doesn’t really register with consumers.

Like taking a couple M&Ms out of the bag but keep the bag the same size. No one knows.
No. 3 should be on 1
well gme gg
There’s much much much worse valuations on the market right now
there's plenty of others: SQ, LULU, FDX, QS to name a few
Bro I’m good at that down 2.7k ytd I just enjoy the rides I’ve had
already 50% of my account lol, bought at 215 bc my penis is large
They have some b2b partnership already signed and are waiting to announce in q1 hopefully the do it on Jan
What's extreme growth though? Their annual revenue for 2020 is expected to be about $1 billion. Are they going to begin to double their revenue year over year or something?
And the most autistic subreddit
Can someone make a PLTR bag meme?  Replace Luis viton with PLTR
Is that Mayweather on the left? What the fuck is that idiot doing with a mil in cash sitting on a table.
Start with a baby binky. They design so that your gaping hole doesn't just swallow it.
Pls tell me baba bottomed out for 2021

Just lie
Y’all know it doesn’t merge til q2 right
[deleted]
They are trying to sell Direct TV and got bids billions less than ATT wanted or originally paid for. Ain’t happening unless they are willing to take huge loss
Lmfao fuck 🤣
#EVERYONE IN THIS SUB^
FLASH SALE ON EVERYTHING BUY BUY BUY
If Cathie got her shit together i would end the day green.
[deleted]
I bought SPY puts today to head fake the market into thinking I was going short. Looks like it took the bait.
FD puts on TSLA was the play there
r/investing would never
Idk but I’m all for another 50 years of trickle down economics and tax cuts on the wealthy! They’ve helped us poor people so much by providing us poor peasants a $7 minimum wage! They’ve so generously increased the minimum wage about a dollar since the 80’s!!!

Why change something if it’s never literally benefited anyone except the ultra rich!!!
Now this is a comment worthy of award, take my gold air
Oh my fucking god
they’ll just censor the news that 230 is repealed. No one will know therefor stonks go up
🤣
Bottom found in FUBO I think
but we need like 50k to play all of the longest on the money options for our winners. Climbing the ladder. I should come up with the tesla dip at end of day today.
I would let Sofia Vergara shit on my face
Real key for easy money is finding out when the first lock ups for AI, ABNB & DASH end. The market just served you up this most bloated IPO’s with artificial scarcity. SNOW and FUBO been doing me a solid.
Buying options before earnings is how you get IV crushed
Think so?
Out there somewhere there has to be some intrepid soul who’s been holding ZM puts since it hit 500+.  Where are you?  Come out and show us your gains.
AAPL about an hour ago would have been good
Every time I feel like I’ve done something dumb, I just look through this sub, and I feel better about myself.

Thank you.
[deleted]
BMY is a boomer stock?
What the fuck is SPY doing?!
[deleted]
We call it "being consistent" here
Make social media more rich. They have plenty of lobbyists and lawyers. Don’t worry
Dump your losses MMs
Face shit everyday
Me too!  Let’s get it!
only a matter of time before TSLA is $750 at this rate
Less word = more profit
I think ARCT was a decent sized holding in the portfolio.. ARCT recently had a -50% day due to bad vaccine news.
Sell $22 calls.
Sell off?
Wuh jus happnd
You aren't Will from 'Good Will Hunting'.
PLTR$

🥺🥺🥺😭😭😭

How are you already up 1000% on deep ITM SPY 2023 leaps? Doesn't seem possible.
I just want to be rich. Filthy blood sucking rich. I live and dream stocks. I want money.  I really want it. I just want to eat and sleep on a bed. I want money. I need money. I need it.  I need the money. STOOOOCCKSSS PLEASE. I want to eat it alive.  Money. Give me money please.
Had a dream AAPL went to 200 in 2021
Spy puts loaded!
What a dumb idea. You can just invest that shit much longer and buy a better version of Tesla in few years with money leftover rather than buying the paint-chipping, low quality dumpster fire Model S that they’re selling right now

Oh I get it, GME was telling us to go to our INNER moons this whole time
No.
7k down on the year, was up 30k in July, been sitting at 2k for a month, so fucking boring
Roll it to a higher price point. Keep the profits. If it continues to go up, you’ll get more profit.

I want to buy stock in the Prysmian group. It’s an Italian conglomerate, but has a ticker on the NYSE that, according to a Schwab guy, “mostly follows the real stock”. ??. The ticker I get from google is PRYMY. 

How do I tell whether it’s ok to buy the American version? Look at volume? Or track it against its real stock abroad
bruhh learned the way many times just wait cos it always drops lmao
lol unless cnc exposes an api where you can track his trades theres no way to do it unless a retard manually inputs all his trades in a db accessible by the program

Yes
AAPL to rally end of day. Good btd opportunity.
Nobody thinking of the potential for psth? All in on march-now 700% gains and thriving. Hope someone sees this
I can’t see this stock go back over $20 until late 2021 or early 2022. If you’re committed, average down. I can see this stock hug $10 to $13 range until September.

Their website says they won’t have product until 2022. My would would be they set that date up to best it.
My rule is usually sell at 300% lol 1000% is wild
I would sell.  Not even worth doing diagonals IMO. Move on to the next trade
I’m jacked to the tits on apple leaps

He said he bought RKT calls like two weeks ago. That was surely a losing trade.  

Though he also said he bought AMD calls and it went up like 6-7% in the two days after that.
You fool
Lol ya except I'm not of the successful autist variety and probs wont own a EV until I'm close to retirement
If your long calls don’t have an exit strategy, it’s because you didn’t create a full plan before entering the trade. 

I use leaps pretty regularly, but always go in with a price target. I will also bail if my thesis is invalidated. You can’t just sit by and do nothing until expiration day comes if the trade isn’t working.
I'll never be good enough for you, son.

no and yes. internet privacy reform has support in both sides
But why?

Why is no one talking about the possible repeal of Section 230? If that happens the tech industry, especially social media, is fuuuuuuuuuuucked.
Tsla
ETF. SPY
Only a retard would’ve yolod into one stock.
Rip
lmao all jokes aside, I think TSLA is just gonna keep going up. I think it might go to like 5k by 2022. not kidding, we might have a huge bubble market coming up. Most of the retards analyst are not in it yet and the retards hedge funds and the mutual funds still think the big auto will kill tesla. But at some point they will have no chioce but to buy or else their customers will leave....

so yeah TSLA to the fucking moon and then will crash but will still be higher than now that's my prediction, I could be wrong tho
Yep, confirmed fact.

Just chucked another few quid at the dip. Literally small change but got to take what I can get 🚀.
In March if you had a crystal ball and knew what was going on you could've made millions in a lot of different ways. Let it go and focus on identifying new opportunities otherwise you'll psych yourself out.
TSLA drops $7 and all the 🐻 come out. It’s just taking a slight rest before hitting $2,500 again next year.
This is why I'm always paranoid about setting limit orders lol
TSLA doesn't have dealerships retard...
Can't wait until I'm not a poor and can afford Tesla calls.

I don't get how PLTR is worth $41 billion when they aren't even profitable yet. Even if the company is legit I think the stock price is ahead of itself. I wouldn't be surprised if ir burns below $20. 

But being a meme stock they will probably announce a $10 million annual contract next week and their market cap will go up another $4 billion lol.

don't play options on a dividend stock.
I think # 4 is the most important. People are leveraging themselves out the ass buying options on stocks, sometimes it's even a smart play, but of a pool of thousands of artists buy $20 mil in options thats not going to move a ticker, that'll just tickle the boomers taints to sell it off and downgrade it just to prove who's really in power. Now if everyone actually bought the Fucking underlying commodity - you bet your ass that stock would shoot up.
yup. almost bought one but couldnt decide

The ratings were dead. They are fighting fire with fire.
In China, since everyone uses their phone to pay for things through Alipay, there's apps that give you "micro loans" like 10 to 30RMB for a meal out with friends or some light shopping. They're basically credit cards apps with 20% interest, but really low monthly minimum payments, so a lot of young people get stuck with thousands in debt, and it can get pretty dark real fast from there. The crack down on Jack Ma's empire is also part of a greater crack down on these predatory lending services as the rising youth consumer debt is causing societal problems.
Lol
Yeah it's the same interview I seen. I heard that but I didn't get it as I'm not  a native speaker. So wtf should I sell? Got PLTR shares, PSTH(a few), full in ARKG genomics and some Warrants Calls on Tesla, Square and Baba (not much).
Why even short at that point? Now they'd lose any profits from short interest and call decay.
Welcome Matt
You bought one?
TSLA gonna have 600 $ stimmys pumping it monday don't fold
At least it’s not 1500 like me retard. I don’t know who’s more retarded you or me because I jumped on the PLTR train at 10 a share bought 300 shares sold at 30 then learned about options. So from 200% since oct to 70% growth with losses totaled in on shitty calls gg.
Lmao
Anyone on here track the options action team from cnbc and their success rate? Pete N. Said he bought GME calls $22 strike for FEB 19 that day I looked and the calls were at all time highs. I bought in a few days later and caught the dip.

Is he just an idiot or is he actually hitting shit? His latest one today that I saw was JETS $27 strike March calls for .60 each.

Can on of you autistic fucks track his plays with java or c++ or something?

I really like the company long term, but damn, after their great social media presence leading up to the merger they haven't posted shit on IG, twitter & YT for 7 days. Makin' me a little nervous (and I'm in the red at this point).
Unlucky
You are beyond retarded and I dont mean that in a meme way. I truly think you are one dumb motherfucker.
[Don't scan my balls](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z_L16MW2PSI).
I sold off the losing speculative portion of my portfolio and rolled it into 4000 shares of PSTH @ \~$26.50 since everyone is screaming "frothing market"  So I might as well let this ride for the long term as with the rest of my portfolio.  


The structure of PSTH and its current institutional holders seems pretty stout, as this is the only way we can get as close to an IPO. I am positive the institutional holders all got in at $20 so they lose really nothing in a time were interest rates are so low, while we on the other hand am risking around 20-25% downside at this current price should it fall apart.   


Where else do you park some cash at such a high point in the market?
Ha jokes on you, I have 172 TSLA call options that is set to expire on 1/29 right now, once the ER comes out, I’d be banking TSLA 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

If you did it once, you can do it again. PLTR will take you back out of this atmosphere. 🚀
Damn every single year?! This guy is a genius!
we need some in-depth DD about RC's shitter tweets STAT.
Obviously will, people move money around on days like this meaning institutional money is pulled out of one part of the market in the morning and put back in that afternoon
Yeah it’s painful

last day of Decembear
Up 61% deposit adjusted across two accounts unfortunately if I did my math right, about half of those gains will be taxed
Could you actually show me an article or something about this? I can't seem to find anything about a pool of shares opening up next week
And now for the massive TSLA sell off!!!
I wanna know about those gainz too
Don't have to pay taxes if you don't want to but hopefully you like soap on a rope.
Lmao. I watch CNBC everyday and she trips me out.
Sold TSLA for 50k 80% profit. Time to go buy me a Model S. I’m off to the dealership
Those aren't systemically overvalued 100 fold.
Looks like the platinum and gold ones are all gone
What happened?
I'm too lazy to watch the market to get the perfect dip.  It's nbd if it drops to 23 or even 19 cuz when its big 🐎🍆 swings to $100 post earnings. 🎉🎉🎉🎉
Lmfaooo you almost needed to pay taxes, and the roasting at this point will only make you feel a bit better or something lol
Suck a bag of dicks while you can
the fact that TSLA went up $50 in 1.5 sessions and people still lost money on calls is peak WSB

Most of the DD was saying real price movement wouldn't start until early January, coinciding with when earnings for the companies start. I think once people realize that steel is going to blow up, all stocks will start upwards momentum

Wow, I appreciate the thorough explanation! I never took into consideration the impact of dividends on the prices of puts or calls.

Makes sense now why we get a little bit more value for puts than calls. Thanks again!

You already mentioned the downside. The stock price doesn't move much. I've got a few calls I'm holding hoping for a bump when hbo max next reports subscriber numbers. But this isn't a stock that will make you rich quick.

$80-$90 is achievable. MU is already above their high of ~$60 from the last cycle. DRAM demand will grow in 18-20% next year and prices will go up the entire year. 


However WDC is a safer bet since not much is priced in yet.

yes i bash the fuck out of intel

and i also happen to own some in my portfolio
Awesome! Thanks man, Ill shoot you a message on reddit then probably easier if you dont have discord.
Respect your nuts good sir. Don’t listen to the tards saying you “shoulda coulda woulda”. You’ll get em again in 2021. Learn from the mistakes
I hope aapl still flat on monday so I can buy more calls when my deposit clears.
Only a opportunity to get a tsla.
You only sell CCs on green days retards
Which one of you sold your calls?
I’m in shambles and all of my calls expire in two weeks. Something tells me next week will be a pullback but SPY is still resting on its 50dma so it should be a bullish week tbf
i believe this is what we call the dip before the rip on TSLA
i bought it literally the day before it dropped like 8%, fuck me
What’s with the SPY spike? What’s the news?

2 reasons. Cathie ran it up earlier this month saying it was her pet fund with the most growth potential. 
Second reason is ARKT stock within the fund tanked. 
Also, growth stocks are having a little pull back right now so that doesnt help
That’s when u buy
This will 🚀
congrats boys we are now 1/5th of the trading volume
YOU AND ME BOTH!!!!! You make me feel better about my decisions.
Rotation out of TSLA into SPY
The real answer is, will it offset any taxable gains this year?

If so sell it today and buy a different cheap strike to lock in the tax loss to 2020
RIP year's bond gains
What is market value for your contracts? You’ll need that times 12.

c'mon, BIDU. you got one more random spike in you
How are you guys red when the market hit ath eoy?
The solution is to realize that stocks are just baseball cards. People like the player, so the value of the card goes up.
Ah yes, because oil and gas has contributed so much for the index.
Too scared to buy anything
What stocks caused spy to skyrocket?
90% of option buyers lose money
Every TSLA short deserve the loss. Period. They lost 40 billion dollars in 2020. Before this year, they lost about $20B. 

Papa Elon and his people are working very hard to do something good for the world. If you are a mean and selfish person, it's fine to stay away and not helping. 

If you want to short Papa Elon to make teddies and hurt Tesla in anyway, you suffer. Fair?

Put this aside, I also found those TSLA shorts have no clue about Tesla and TSLA. They say it's over valued, but they don't have the slightest idea how to value this company.
Just buy a lottery ticket. What happened to this place it used to be about making ballsy trades based on speculative info now it's a bunch of cucks buying $TSLA calls and thinking they know something. All because I said you could make money off bearish plays.
What's the downside to AT&T?  The stock price doesn't move much, it went from 38 to 28 in the big crash last March.  You've got 5g coming up.  HBO max is finally on Roku.  It has a massive donkey dong of a dividend and HBO is gonna make it grow big.  What is the downside?

I’m confused on it, it’s a direct listing so I thought there wasn’t a lock up.
What is that supposed to do
ARK divs will cut through those losses ever so slightly
Lol ok. Let's see what happens at end of Q1 when lockup expires
PLTR
What’s up with the space between the words and the periods/punctuation? Why does your mom write like that?
2021 just means 2020 won so 2021 will just be the awful aftermath of 2020. then after that 2022 is just 2020 two. never ending cycle

Damn that’s amazing 👊👊
Its extremely low risk at this point. Already near the floor, so atbworst possible casr you almost break even. Best case scenario is like 4x your bet.
You exit when they expire wothless tho
yeah that's what LEAPs are, you don't have to worry about any short term volatility because you're set on expiry date.
Only pussies care about covid now
Why is ARKG down this much for the week.

that’s the formation spy boutta pull
💎🖐🤚 baby
Not too worried my calls are for June.
Is there any type of TSLA news that will happen between now and January 8 like a delivery number announcement? Please let me know
No
wonder if you need to close these options today in case there is a tax bill?  Technically expired worthless options are removed from the account on the day after the expiration date, which is Jan 1, 2021.

You may get a tax bill for the previous gains for 2020, but this week's loss *may be* pushed out to 2021.
Wasn't there some dude who bought 0 dte tsla puts?
I can’t look at my account until PLTR is above 25. Good lord

In the market for a new butt plug. What do y’all recommend
no ofc you should diversify and not just count on one single strategy. However, in the long run, she will beat all of my mutual funds. She has a long term vision, which most hedge funds and mutual fund managers don't. Plus, the fees these take are just too much tbh. That's why I prefer ETFs. honestly, I'd prefer buying the QQQ instead of mutual funds at this point. In this crazy bull market that we had this year. my mutual funds didn't even deliver 1 quarter of most of these run ups... some are still down from last year.

But yeah I see your point, my guy don't worry I'm not dumb either :)) thanks for your inputs

Yes
He can fund the SEC more so they can allow tighter trading restrictions but that might blow back on rich people so I doubt it
Actually that is not true, the 2020 tax date on capital gain/loss is Dec 29th. So any gain/loss occur after that is going to count as 2021 taxes. So he kinda fucked up
Im slowly moving to theta gang but a non-conservative bitch thetagang.  a full blown captain autism theta gang.  selling ITM Naked puts on GME brb.
No you didn’t. I just came out

I'm not sure you fully understand the consequences of a dictatorship as violent as Pinochet's are. Besides the thousands of people that are still missing, the killed, and the tortured, the economic model of Friedman that Pinochet used has failed long term in Chile: the people that live in precarious conditions of living are protesting on the streets since last year. The biggest protest had around 15% of the country. I assume you are from the US (may be wrong). At the scale of your population, that would be 45 million people protesting at the same time because they don't agree with the model currently used and the consequences it has had on their lives.

All that said, I don't really come to Wendy's to argue politics, so this will be my last answer. Hope it is useful and can make people that agree with the last comment, understand better the real consequences of a militar dictatorship.

My theory is that our timeline branched off into a spiral of doom ever since they fucked up the ending
I have a $40 cost basis. I’ll buy more if it gets oversold or on market pullbacks. 
I love using their product. They have the best trading app I’ve seen. It’s growing like a weed (200% YOY rev growth.) it’s profitable. They have direct HK listings and direct multinational IPO offerings. It should blowout the competition when it hits the US, which they plan to do. 
FUTU might 50x if the Biden tax plan happens. I’m leaving the US along with other fund managers I work with if that gets implemented.

Except there is a time where you know. Once you’ve realized that you have been on a winning streak that just doesn’t stop, it’s time to start throttling back.

How is spy and boomer Jones flat while my watchlist starts at -2% and lower
You will be a retard if you are not look at NIO. Many catalysts next year.
No sir. I just want to buy and hold the equity. I’ll buy calls if the stock gets oversold.
you still got more than 1k to yolo retard

its not over yet
Hey I like making money, if you don’t oh well
Step-NIO, what are you doing?
We blaming next Mondays red on profit taking also?
Why? If you bought at $31, what is the smart way to make money until February? Calls? Puts?

I just started investing a month ago, so I don't even have gains to make up for it. I just followed whatever WSB did and bought 27$ PLTR shares... I surely am a fucking autist
Buy my PLTR call please
Because of you autists every time I open my portfolio and see red I audibly say “GUH!” now
There’s a ton of things you’re discounting or not addressing here. If I had one person to pick to beat the market over the long run, it would be her. But you can’t treat this as something that’s a sure thing. That’s how so many people around here lose money during a crazy bull market.
Someone fill my $40 GME order for 150 calls it’s open
Faakeeee out
yep... sold QS at 69 for slight loss... for it to moon to touch 140 5 days later lol
spy only looks likes a lot is going on because we haven’t seen a move greater than .2% all day btw
Thank you for your service I need to stop looking at my shares for a few weeks
I'm losing faith in my 1/22 30cs
Does Zoom have more to go down?? Thinking of 1/15 $300 puts
There's no way we are ending red today on the last day of the year. I mean, come on. Lol.
Ass.
Your losses are realized, correct? Ie you’ve sold the securities? If not sell them ASAP...like in the next hour...so you have a capital loss to offset your 2020 capital gains.

This right here. I have to keep my shares out of RH because of my tendency to Pussy hands them
But Roth IRA is tax free growth. When I make my 800% gainz, I don't want Biden stealing half!
My plan is to use $69.420 proceeds to buy more GME then go to $694.20. Gotta play it smart
Also MT, AAPL, Cathie's ETFs
pleas fly vale. pleas.
went down then up gone nowhere today :(
I’m hoping it continues at least one more revolution.
Yesterday I was celebrating making enough to pay off my student loans. Today I lost those gains. Market is truly humbling and I have got to control my risk
Don't worry, now you know what NOT to do when you invest real money
I didn’t profit, I lost 50% on the trade lmaoo
Shit will drop more

What strike and expiry you got?
Did jpow accidentally hit the print button?
Spot on. I remember as well I sold 300 shares and 10 call options contracts with a strike of $10.50 on that day, 2 hours before the Microsoft news that sent it flying. I was sick to my stomach after seeing that haha I still had a lot of shares but those contracts would have printed money. Since then I just never sold.
We are in a time of peace there is literally no volume in any stock rn. People are busy enjoying the last bits of the holidays. Now is not the time to expect market movement. 10% days were during a time of pandemics, stock splits, sp inclusions.
I know what they are supposed to do.  Make me spicy tendies.

RC has probably thought these things out with his activist lawyers.
Emojis are vague and meaningless enough for regulation, but just enough imo to stir up support and rally to potential plans to take over.

That, on top of the fact that his style of investing is needle-point focused and precise.

:) wrong address mate. You probably was/would be saying same thing about Chewy, and somehow it was worth 3 billions to some certain company that "was doing it better".

For each of your arguments I could give you simple contra argument, but you still would be nay sayer, so I'm going to save your time.

To sum it up - I will stay in my, what you would most definitely call, denial , me and few folks around including some institutional players, and will keep my shares till they get to $35-40 at least, and they will get there sooner than later. My money thank you for your concerns, but they are in good hands. 💎👐 

Edit - last time I heard it was Ryan Cohen that was billionaire, not someone called fr0st2k.
Wouldn’t u just sell a put with a lower strike then

I bought some PLTR shares for fun at 21 (EUR). My German trading app went full retard and told me I am at -80% loss. Combined loss is equivalent to PLTR being below zero per share. I assume it's the calm before the storm, until  it flies to the moon🌜🚀

One of my teachers used to have this challenge where if you scored a 0 on his multiple choice tests(they were famed for being very difficult) you would get a 200% on the exam, but you had to sign an agreement before taking the exam, if you failed and got 1, 2, etc right you would get 2%, 4%, etc...  The exams were usually 50 questions long but sometimes they would be 75, 100, and once even 200.

Got killed on my Jan21 300c. just went to shit after the earnings report.  Prolly profit taking by the big guys but I really f'd that up.  Been tracking it with some rudimentary TA and I'm betting it will hold at 260 before maybe heading north again.   I want to jump back in with a Jun or July 350c but the bad taste is still in my mouth.   Will probably do it though

Turned 1k into 1.2k in a few months that's about it. Ain't much but its honest work. Mostly pltr and air canada

I was honestly speechless for a few minutes.  I can't imagine how I'd take a series of swings like that.  Which is why with the way I invest, if it goes to zero, that almost certainly means that money is the least of my problems.

Yeah, buy them tomorrow, when the markets closed.

Sell now
It is, it's also got a massive borrow rate to short, so i'm deff expecting some volatility both ways.
Please stop handing out all these Ternion and Platinum. Save it for the short squeeze.

good call man, i have micro-insider information (do inventory at large hospital) and we've ordered so much of their shit.
I don’t think you know what naked calls are
Have you been trading it?
No one uses NIO’s driving assistance in any Chinese metropolitan city because using it means you will die.

Source: have Chinese friends.
If.  Or you could just as easily have lost everything like 90% of this sub. This is why I love the wheel. If you make x, give back 10% of it and and buy equivalent puts for insurance.
Can’t we send the SEC ?
Treat yourself to something nice if your YTD gains were good even if today's shit
Jan 2021 $27
This is so gay
PLTR is shitty like Mitch
They only say that because they're scared of you, don't give in big man
I mean $151 bucks vs $2,700 sucks buts it's not life changing...wait how many contracts?
My Portfolio looks like the red wedding. Robb ARK please stop the bleeding

I plan to sell all my stupid BRK-A shares to rotate into GME when the short squeeze gets that price over $100.
I went full retard and bought some Moderna shares at the absolute peak.

Now it's -37% :D

Still ended 2020\* positively tho, despite selling roughly at the bottom in March and then waiting for the next crash until July. Magic.

\* TBF there's still few more hours to go and it's creeping down slowly so who knows.
That's what happens when you fly too close to the moon
your calls r fuk
Didn't expect the wsb curse to work on an etf too, the moment wsb trying to pump ARKG it went down the following week.
[deleted]
Well yeah and if he does another he’s closer to the actual penalty for too many good faith credit violations. And did STIC go up really fast and he dumped or did he take the loss. Either way, it’s his money and he should make the smart move. If STIC ran 20% in one day I think anyone who calls him a pump and dumper is forgetting the fact that he’s just locking in the ridiculous new found gains
Then why am I in the red 🤧😭
NO PENNY STOCK TRASH!
How much do these rewards cost and what do they do I never understood that and when I ask I get downvoted.
Instead of buying LEAPs on PLTR at these inflated premiums, sell LEAPs instead. Take advantage of that IV. Your cost basis selling ATM strikes if assigned is $14 a fucking share. 

Retards, fuck you.
That’s it after today I’m not trading until next year.

You only lost 50%. I'd say that's way ahead of the posse. 
And now you know what you're doing! Get back in there. 2021 is your year!
Yeah
Fees are less than one percent... The literature is on mutual funds and hedge funds who consistently underperforms the market. Rn Even if she makes 0 gains next year. She will still have beaten the sp 500 over her entire period.
On crashing years ark will dip a lot more than sp 500. But they will also buy the dips heavily and then the years after that it'll recover extremely fast. She has the buffet mindset and doesn't really do short term trades meanwhile she chooses insane growth stocks that will change the world.
Hedge funds and mutual funds spend too much on short term trades, dividend stocks and bonds... Huge reason why they aren't doing as well.
Honestly if you just bought tesla last year like all tesla stocks, like rn even if tesla stops growing for 10 years you'd still hear the market on average...
Btw speaking of Tesla, I have only traded it one time. Bought a shit ton of calls. It was the time the stock dropped 25% in September. I’m literally just bad luck. I was playing it for the SP500 inclusion, but my luck was bad and it didn’t get included. Haven’t touched it since then.
This sub breeding serial killers rn

Best thing to do on a day like this is not open your account
It's not end of year profit-taking. I think institutions are on holidays that's why volumes are low.

SPY with volumes at 26% of average.
Man i need a break. After today im not trading again until next year
Like they said, shittiest day ever
Volume?
Psth holders are waiting for announcement. Not too many gonna sell until then which is why buyers are pushing momentum and price is steadily rising every day as LOI hype grows. 


    

Most people understand why psth will probably spike when merger target announced. Most people do not understand that psth will spike much, much higher a second time as the warrant transfer date approaches.
DKNG January 21st 2022 90c?
Pump and dump or not nobody is making anyone play OTM weeklies that these dumbnuts are losing all their money on. Everyone is able to make their own decisions. Tons of people made plenty of money already on PLTR.
Thank you for the donation! 🙆🏻‍♂️
It's funny, I used fibonacci extensions on the 5 minute chart and arrived at 738. Then I went over to level 2 data and saw a huge sell order from the Chicago exchange at that very price (options market expected move hedges), this confirmed my 738 target.

Also, thanks!
Im All in aswell, turned 18 a couple of weeks ago and now I’m balls deep with all my savings in NIO🚀🚀🚀
F
Maybe
If u have a position is better. Iron Condors, strangles. Or less risky ratio spreads, broken wing butterflies. Nonetheless, TSLA has outrageous moves, so might be tough to get OTM enough & still get the price you’re looking for. Lots of fluctuations. GL!
I see no down side
Shorty got so low she shit herself.

What, and you can only buy shares at market close?

The day Citron announced their short PLTR started off with a rocket that got a lot of people to FOMO in above 30.
I know that he threatened to do it. But don't know if it will go down for sure.
I got alcohol hun and anything you like I will get it for you. Just call me daddy!

[removed]
Fair point. I’m not saying it’s a massive gains type of play. But options plays with 2-5x returns on something that’s a little more reliable than these meme stocks is still fun and good money. Just saying. You only need a 1-2% price jump for those returns. Same as playing SPY.
I bought 200 shares of ROKU at $34 in Dec 2018. I believe it’s market cap at that time was around $2B. FUBO less than that now and has a huge addressable market.
TSLA on some bipolar shit and PLTR is just a dirty little slut getting down this low (23 eod)

We are brothers in arms here, friend.  This is as much a moral crusade for me at this point as it is about making it rain.  These short sellers are corrupt as hell and the system that allows them to thrive and profit is as well.  Getting on the other side of that and feeling like we have the upper hand for once is a goddamn thrill. 

And I'm not selling or lifting my boot off their necks until I **know** that the shorts on the other side of that trade are on their last breath.

i think unlikely, in any case those etfs will be making decent returns for many years to come

It's just been pumped on WSB lately.

I sold, I'll buy back next week
this was intense ... what is portfolio now
It's fun to fake cry at a dip week, but the fact is that I can afford more shares. If there are spikes, that's when I sell my calls to have cash for shares at dips. So I'm cool. I'm loading up as much as I can all year till it hits 50, then I'm holding for the next 5-10 years.
Ima try to hold maybe it’ll go back up through January
Thanks. I thought if it when I was bleaching taint
What "major buy"?
Ur gonna make money... but u could make the same returns with an ETF or by throwing it in DIS or SNE. Think about it this way, it’s much harder to grow a 2 trillion dollar company 5%, than it is for a 2 billion dollar company to grow 10%.
If you diamond handed TSLA would have dropped to 600 so don't feel too bad
Just need your Name, address, DOB, and SSN
I don't think so boi
Whats the cost basis on the PLTR shares?? If you close to maxed out your margin in the PLTR position when it was higher, it's entirely possible you are just overleveraged and the covered calls you sold are reducing your total margin requirement, those calls could be the only thing keeping you afloat because it's positively contributing to your maintenance margin. So if there's significant value left on them, then buying them back would actually decrease your available liquidity by the amount that's left on them and that's why it's not letting you close them out. So you'll have to sell other positions instead or wait until expiry..
What I want to know is why the $140 price floor over the past 3 days
thats rude

Weird.. somehow still only know one person who had it. He’s a personal trainer and was completely fine
[deleted]
It’s all there. I already harvested whatever losses I could before year-end.
Stagflation? With all the QE that's been happening?

its only stagflation if economic output doesn't increase. economic output increases if infrastructure, stimulus. Keynes shit.

Why'd you ask how old I am?
[deleted]
wtf dash?
Why do you subconsciously hate money and love poverty?
You have $1k. Just turn it into $50k in a month and then cash out before the losing everything part
I’ve lost a lot the past 2 weeks too
Tesla is like Forest Gump. 

"I was running."

Agreed on ROKU. Outrageous move from 250.
TSLA 01/08 700P is literally free money.
Lmao I got a funded phd, I didn't pay for it
basically this and buy crsp dip today and sell tomorrow at close
[deleted]
I never understood guys with a pay pig fetish who get off on giving all their money away to some bimbo to spend. After joining WSB and trading options with RH though, I think I finally get it. All this red makes me horny!

💎🖐🖐 till I get 100% completion on this game
Hopefully lmao
I sold some to cover my buy in and in hindsight that was a bad move too
Me in canada stuck with that trudeau idiot. What's to raise taxes on capital gains again. What can I do?
I trade cfds lol I just keep making shitty picks
Not according to others here. :)
Positions?
TQQQ and SOXL have made me mega stonks. SOXL hit like $50 in March and is currently close to like $500. That's what's in my retirement account lmao
its like the moment i started buying ark they all started sliding down day after day.
The best dogs gets the most rewards, if you let uncle sam rob you it’s still gonna be less painful than fighting for freedom, see venezuela. Economic warfare is real, yall need to read john hopkins economic hitman. (There is a video on youtube if you can’t read)
Nothin like tracking a wounded animal through blood soaked ❄️. Only a matter of time before you lay down and die SNOW.
Look at DASH chart now
 🤝

^(Fine print: the 7 quadrillion dollars in guaranteed gains by the time I liquidate all my assets and retire will only represent approximately 51 trillion dollars in today's money after inflation. Your mileage may vary following my advice. Breadbox Analytica takes no responsibility for losses due to paper hands or failure to evade taxes. Please trade responsibly and never while driving.)
I had 12/31 690 TSLA calls that I paper handed on Tuesday. Sold for 1.51 they are now worth 27. I hate myself
March 2020, waking up to 20K margin call everyday for like a week. Lost 120K during that time. That's fun. Made it all back and then some.
Thank you for making me feel much less retarded about my 4K->16k->3K
TSLA sell sell sell sell
thought they already did an offering, so split next?
Thanks
Wash sale
F
My brother has two Tesla’s. Yeah the model S has some issues.
Is putting 1000$ into mara stock right before close today a bad idea? It's got to go up next week, right?
It worked! Lol
The PLTR train left the station a few weeks ago.
Time is a flat circle
You got this homie! You’ll be the first comeback story of 2021.
It’s cool, teach that man spreads and he’ll be aight.
So apparently I sold 12 covered calls and put up 1200 PLTR shares.  

Everybody told me I’m an idiot so I went to close my positions and buy back the 12 covered calls and Robinhood told me I don’t have the buying power to close my own positions on my own covered calls

What the fuck have I done, I’m stuck in positions and cant buy or sell them now
https://twitter.com/latimes/status/1344648353397702657?s=19

Slightly OT but guh?
2.54 for mine
and yet those bags will be worth more than the bags some hold on this sub
Hope you’re ready for our 100 bagger
Only thing pltr knows how to do is drill. Peter steal has your $$ now
I'm trying to get approved to trade options on schwab and it's a hassel. Is there a better app for trading options right away?
Bro cash out and reset for the New Years. Secure those gains
Ah you bought GOEV too I see. Won a fair bit back from the bee and PSTH.
Dash spikes to $145
Did DASH kill Mitch or something? wtf
Yeah looks like a blow off top to me

If I told you to cross the street blind folded and you survived. Would that make that action smart?
Guys chwy is really cheap rn
12/31 $50c bought for $0.16 yesterday and sold for $1.01 today. Had 5 of them.
If you’d quit hanging out with the poor you’d see everyone is buying them
Here's how this sub works...

- Knowledgeable people quietly hype a position for months. The only people that respond or pay any attention tell them to fuck off because they are still betting their asses off in the most recently dead meme stock. 

- Eventually these bets start paying off, a small number of people notice.

- The early adopters start sharing their moon-adjacent, months old positions they just closed as the position has 5x'd.

- Everyone starts taking positions, jerking their dicks and posting rocket/moon emojis acting as if ***they*** found the next big thing, enjoying the last 10% of the bull run.

- Nobody gets out with their sizeable 10% gains so late in the hype cycle and instead makes endless memes about moons and rockets expecting their positions to also 5-10x. 

- The latest of the late adopters get on board seeing every post in WSB about this position.  The memes shift away from rockets and into scenes from superhero movies explaining how it's going to "come back". 

- People who know what they are doing have long since moved on and begin hyping up something new. WSB tells them to fuck off as they continue to dildo their assholes to the comeback memes. 

(See PLTR and GME)
Well what are you gonna do? The two largest economies in the world are these two...
Ofc is hope for things to be better but seems like there's always a compromise...
What time does the stronk marquet end
Buy sq dip??
My name is Sam: 🚀🚀🚀
RIP to the guy who bought my weekly PLTR 32 CCs on monday
Big oof
Considering I’m red for the year maybe I should quit this lol
No tax for end of the year
Thanks my man.
Yeah Chinese stocks are undervalued but never touch them
Dash just spiked 3.5% instantly from $140 and I sold!
Definately lives in River Oaks
Loving that civil war era $5
Yeah cuz paper hand is real when looking at losses. Better to not look
Alexa play the little Einstein theme song
ummmm no, its not
But then again, it’s basically impossible $40 strike by 1/15...
Feeling a strong urge to cash out please console me brothers
Thanks <3
This is my power with my 0DTE options. 720 TSLA 🚀🚀🚀🚀💰💰💰💰💰💰🍆🙏🙏🙏🙏
Haha, guys here can't handle more than 3 down days. Lotta chicken-littles running around these parts.
Ah yes I remember 6 months ago when I bought intc after it dropped 15% in a day. It's still there at 50
Speak for y’all selves 😂😂😂😂
not calling it a permanent top - you are delusional if you think it will not pull back in January and this guy wants to buy monthly calls so I warned him.
I've been holding on to these stocks since last year
Bro don’t hurt yourself
-7800
There’s still time in 2020
🐝🐝🐝 making a move
I have a theory that the rich elites who control the world (and the market/finance) are keeping this shit propped up by allowing stocks to keep mooning and retards like us to make tendies on TSLA because they know if shit actually went back to historical valuations and crashed its likely the lower/middle class would revolt and go after the rich cunts.. They are using stocks as a tool to keep us 'satisfied'.
I think you’re on to something, what would the downside of doing this be if any?
Oh she frying
Arkk has been getting murdered. Good lord what is going on, is it the biotech stocks causing it?
MSFT and AAPL, what are you doing?????
>Single digit in shares

Ban
I’ve almost wasted an entire day watching the market. I’ve made zero moves. All cash. Time well spent!
You think UPWK has bottomed out? Tempted to buy in and start selling some covered calls off of it
Most of us would have done better by doing nothing the past few months. And I mean nothing as in literally nothing. No positions.
Ride it lmao, what’s $11 gonna do
Condolences. I’ve sucked too
I. Fucking. HATE. DoorDash.
Fair warning was trying to sell my current calls before EOD and double down monday
Some IV crush on TSLA would be nice
I know :/ we’re in this together
Do it and ill grab puts. Theta can't beat all of us 😤
Well, I laughed, but PLTR diamond hands probably didn't
🤣🤣🤣
Let's go to the HOON
Time to buy some PLTR?
Nobody tell him.
Like -25% so far. I'm trying to stay hard
Alex Karp is too much of a weirdo to do that. Or maybe I'm just projecting.

RC seems like he's banging Miami hoes in his waterfront mansion while he's taking a break from existing as an entrepreneurial genius complete with a "my dad died and I became unstoppable" origin story. He also tweets infrequently, after coming up for air from all the pussy he's swimming in, and comes with some assured shitpost that communicates he knows what he's doing and the rest of us don't.
AMZN 2350 EOD
What did you have
he didn’t, its just an options table
:( we can hold each other... at this point I may just set a lmt price for 100% profit... and not look for 1 month lol
Start reaping the premium , covered calls yield fat cash
I’m not complaining, I have several TSLA calls I’ve had since last week. But it’s blowing my mind how TSLA is powering through these walls and still rising. Literally just gonna buy every TSLA dip from now on.
a stock
Hmmm... lol I guess I do have proof but I’m not allowed to disclose it, since I work in a trading firm.

But ok, I suppose for somebody who cannot discover alpha, the market might as well be efficient to them.
I do, it's crazy... and I consider myself a TSLA bull, although a realistic one
PLTR DUMPING
Sold out yesterday to wait for a big move before getting back in and that pump fake at open got me good.

If you bought and hold you would be +300%
Yeah that was the problem from the start with me.. Goodluck
Tesla power hour
AAPL is fucking lame as fuck.

That’s a lot of GME and PLTR shares and options 🤤
Made 350% on FUBO puts

Not able in my broker. I use eToro.
What’s in your buy and hold garden? Any tips?
So many ups and downs this year wtf lol. At one point i was up 70%.

Gonna end the year down 1 grand.
Its like I just waisted countless hours of my time watching numbers go up and down for no real reason.
hi just saw this \*curb your music starts playing\*
I have lost an average of $15k every day for the last 2 weeks
Thank you! This post should definitely get PLTR back on track
I'm guessing people are stashing their profits in it as a safe hold.
That’s the gayest thing I’ve read
[FACEPALM]
You lost me at not retarded
it's still drilling fk 😭
Daily reminder baba has been oversold since November
Is BLNK dead? Down 60% on my 1/22 $55c. Should i just unload it?
Look at the max chart.  Highly doubt that happens
sold my put order when it dipped to 138 earlier, this shit is so rigged.
Pltr pweaz fry agin
DASH 🚀
Broker? I trash my accounts on my own, thank you very much.
Fade DXY pop
I thought about inversing the play and then decided to inverse myself.  Big brain moves
Dash is so manipulated lol
Look at dash now bitch!
29th was the last day to do this I think. These sales will settle in 2021
2/19/21 , $26C
Only down about 2% today. Nice change of pace
I was looking at the PLTR chart today.

Anything in the reasonable range you're pretty much better off with shares at the moment.
[deleted]
Don't be an idiot, everyone was recommending that you buy shares.
yep in musk we trust... but gawd damn I should've just diamond handed my tsla stocks/calls I got at 1100 (Pre split)

I dont even know what it is tbh. But it has Rocket in it's name, which is more than enough DD for me.
Lol I’m gonna wait for some sort of a dip and try to grab some calls.
Let’s all jerk off and bust the moment the market closes so we can end the year right
Keep some money to buy the dips...
Tho 16 seems impossble...
Mama Cathy will start buy again if it happens
Gotta wait 30 days chief. Google wash sale rule
🍏 cucking call holders hard
Do I buy calls on Friday or right now idk what to do
Fitting I end the year with losing on every trade I’m in.

Don't talk about my mom like that.
Dude I agree that corona isn’t that big of a deal if you’re in perfect health comparatively.

But you overestimate the health complications that can cause a serious case. My mother is in really good health with the only minor complication being high blood pressure. She is classified as a high risk category.

A cycling buddy of mine was in incredible health and was put on a respirator from his exposure. We’ve lost people in their 40s where I live who were in incredible health and who competed in mountain biking races.

1. Stop trying to guess what 'fair value' is - it doesn't fucking exist.

When shit crashed in March 'fair value' went out the fucking window quicker than a fat kid in a candy shop - then suddenly sentiment changed and everything was fine again (because the rich cunts who control this shit decided so and the "Fed printing" was the excuse.) The reality is it all means fuck all - its just a massive casino with a select few who control which direction things move and when they want out they make it go down to imply the market can actually lose value and isn't manipulated (hint hint it is).
You come from a long line of retards who have called the TSLA top
Still great run tho, very nice. 👌
PLTR drilling more lmfao
He said no more Tesla stock... That doesn’t mean no more Tesla options. 👁👄👁
Thanks, that was a great read. He slaughtered them

That sideways action is always killer and burns
Ending the year with my account down 69% nice
Good luck retard
So cringe
This loser over here telling everyone how super duper smart he is. That's awesome you cheated your way thru Oxford using mommy and daddy's money. Graduated middle of your class im sure. Got out into the real world and learned real quick that your parents lied to you when they told you how special you are.

Do it or ban
Bruh...
Long dated calls in not retarded companies.
Bought back into BABA at a lower premium.  Stocks on discount.
Do you realize that they will be a paper trillion dollar company in 3 months?
Watch your theta playa
You can expect it continue indefinitely with meme stocks and small caps. A LOT of people joined the market in 2020, so while most of the market should be starting to head back in the direction of normalcy, it will always be at least a bit more volatile than it used to be.
Started the year with 150 bucks made many deposits but also Made 2800 in profits. Account sitting at 10kish. PLTR and RKT my big winners.
I have zero faith in the start of the year for stocks to do well. I am never bearish, and I am becoming extremely bearish
AAPL
Crash?! CRASH?! 

Time to sell everything.
I can’t believe I bought MT calls thinking that fundamentals actually meant something, now im bag holding calls on a boomer stock that doesn’t move

Well just bought 2 BABA, 2 LH, and 4 PEP shares to end the year.

Gimme one last odte for the year
DASH wtf!
I responded to a post the other day and made a stupid reply. I got gilded. Then, I aggressively edited/replied stating that you could have bought a fraction of a share of GME.
Do you think he'll eventually disappear from history as written in the Chinese fairy tales.
I think you misheard us when we said we were gonna ask the 8 ball
Look at DASH lmao
Made it to the first bullet point, read “1. FUCKING STOP”, so I did. No idea what gibberish followed.
You're my spirit animal
I bought 150 shares at 34 and then another 50 at 63 lol. Oooof
I prefer that but I’m old fashion

Is amzn ever worth buying again or will it stay flat for eternity
Yup. Dems won't be able to raise taxes as much as they'd like with a 50-50 split.

I can see them spending more on stimulus though.
how much premium you get?
Yeah it was pretty awesome. They just started a few variables and got more and more random till they honed in on a new element. Apparently the scientist had the idea to call it Monte Carlo math from a gambling uncle.
Just buy a few shares every day it’s red till you average into the bottom. It’s what arkk does
Please hold until expiration so I can see the loss porn

Monday I am going g to quadruple down on my two biggest losers. Probably BigC and Planters peanuts.
 Hey that’s me
You trade based on news tho. We don’t. That’s why we love it so much. It’s a tax free account hold that will pump dividends in 10 years and extreme growth in the meantime. Maybe you’re a natural though and superior to minds like Klarman and my own.
You could also be right... And you will still have retards who try and tell you its fairly valued at $6900 a share because future earnings n shit
Precisely
buying the top I see. thank you for your sacrifice. 

TSLA reports numbers monday premarket - be careful
feeling like bul is fuk

but idk tho

but maybe
Tesla quality is awful but I still want one 😂
PSTH has been quietly mooning. What's going on? Do the whales know something we don't?
No it’s not it’s gonna die with my calls
Thanks. You think my Restrictions will transfer with me?
when it's gone on a bull run
Will i have to read? If no reading, yes.
6 months ago my account was $40k plus...I bought 100 shares of Tesla. Then sold and played options on other stocks, working hard waking up early everyday, struggling with wins and losses. Today my account is $25k. If only I kept the shares and never looked at my account.
1. Who says I dont?
2. Do you have any proof they are inefficient to a measurable degree?
yo shoutout to the guy who was representing REGI every day here back in June, my 401k appreciates you
I thought today gonna close early like pre thanksgiving

I was wrong😢
If only there was one who could unite the Palantards the way they united GME gang
Spent a lot of money on 44 PLTR 04/21c. Am I fucked, retarded, or both? Or is there a chance?
Markets closed tomorrow
You got puts, huh?
TSLA is sucking the air out of the room. PLTR is now dipping, that’s all.

Making sure no calls are left with value
The next two terms are unique to PSTH SPAC warrants. 

* If the shares trade $36 or more for 20 out of 30 trading days, the warrants can be redeemed by management.
* If the price per share equals or exceeds $20 for 20 out of 30 trading days, management could also redeem it.
I always wanted to know what having platinum felt like
Strange....I haven't received my text message from him yet. I always knew you were his favorite.
5 today, they close 1 hr early tomorrow
ipoc gonna blow off the top on monday 👍
Or it ban do
Can’t hold ATH, can’t hold 135-132, lmao yeah that 80% gain is a nice cushion for when it sells off 40%
Tech aside, NIO cars have better interiors imo
I would coom
🤝
vol is still good on PLTR so do it until vol dies like RKT
Oh hell yeah
Haha, 💰💰 for us next week
garçon, 800mg of melatonin, please.
.... from what I understand the next thing should be another offering, no?
Feeling this one 😢
TSLA is, gonna hit 750.0 today. ¡Olé!
Not unrealistic. Tesla has terrible quality control
Haha... so the silver, gold or money awards aren't actual money? What a rip.

I just want the pee martini award
I'm just gonna exclusively buy monthly tesla calls at this point. Basically a printing press for cash
I sold them to you. Good luck!
Id settle for 100. In fact if it hits 100 by end of 2021 i might run up and down my street naked
New years day can't hurt me

PLTR gang are beside themselves. Driving around downtown begging (thru texts) Citron contacts to the CEOs home” 

Overheard inside WSB after today's selloff.
“He got me,” WSB said of Citrons short of PLTR. "That fuking Citron boomed me."

WSB added, “They are so corrupt” repeating it four times.
WSB then said he wanted to add PLTR to the list of dips they plan to buy.
This may as well be the rally cry of AMZN players the last 6 months.
Oh I know. I’m all in.
So I'm guessing we'll end red/flat today
Up 80% in a year, down 1% today = trash
NIO cars ranked higher than Teslas in terms of quality according to Chinese source, probably some nationalist propaganda but at the same time the hype up to Nios battery day is going to launch this thing into the stratosphere.
The market prior to COVID was already rallying for months, it was a great market.

I haven't looked but I'd wager the put volume is huge compared to call so mms probably manipulating to not have to pay out
since you're a bond trader, it close at 2.

4 for the rest of us ;)
What are you waiting for?  Put that $2k to use
Hahaha- I'm in the same boat as you. Might jump in mid-Jan if it's not too late.
if you have a losing position and you do not expect that position to gain the same amount as your tax rate within 30 days, you should sell it and harvest loss. do not repurchase within 30 days or u will bigly fuck urself.
Why sell on a red day. 🤦🏻‍♂️ in a few weeks it’ll be back to ath since q4 is right around the corner. Stocks go up stocks go down. Sign out and live life.
Picked up a few, good find

And accordingly that wasn't a black swan either. Look up talebs comments confirming that claim, that Covid wasn't a black swan
You leave my puts alone

Missed the part where she said "have cash to take advantage of it".  Problem is I'm also fully invested. Gotta prostitute myself so I can afford to buy the dip.
I use it for quotes and option chain, but their fills are so ass, so I do my actual trading on Fidelity.
I buy more whenever it's under 25. I just buy and buy. Because I trust the CEO and I know it's going to fucking orbit when their numerous government contracts marinate

But... the new console sales are such a temporary thing and GameStop’s primary business is in buying used games for next to nothing and reselling them — and 80% of the new consoles being sold don’t even have a disk drive, everybody is moving to buying games digitally. So a business that exists based on old console game disk sales just doesn’t seem to make sense

This stock has been flying sideways!
How much did the 750 call cost you?
Everyone asks “what is Snek” but nobody ever asks “How is Snek” ☹️

Yep, this is why I bought a bunch of Jan 15 30c @ $1 because I'm a big brain.

Yeah I'm monitoring it, but because in my time zone it's about to be nye I may not have the time or the mental state to keep doing so. I'll see what happens and otherwise will probably buy directly after the weekend.
lol yeah I knew I should've just fomo'd at tsla 400 last month.
I just see a lot of people expecting something in January. Attention spans and all that. Its nothing but reputation and spaculation. I’ll still probably get a little lol.

This is lame when all your money is tied up
I love using their product. They have the best trading app I’ve seen. It’s growing like a weed (200% YOY rev growth.) it’s profitable. They have direct HK listings and direct multinational IPO offerings. It should blowout the competition when it hits the US, which they plan to do. 
FUTU might 50x if the Biden tax plan happens. I’m leaving the US along with other fund managers I work with if that gets implemented.
TSLA is in a meltup caused by a battle between shorts and retardant-strength buyers. But when the zenith of this battle is finally reached, god help us all. It’s going to take the entire market down with it.
A manager will be with you momentarily. You have 4,067,987,969 people ahead of you.

you've held it this long might as well hold it and see the announcements they make in January about partnerships. hoping that will start to bump them in the right direction because this week has been brutal

I had one! Honestly I thought that it was great (had the original with 2 inches of polymer), and the polymer collapsed just right for me (145lbs). It gave my girlfriend pains though because she didn't sink into it enough (130lbs). If you're heavier than 145-155lbs I'd go with one with more polymer (3-4 inches). If you actually do end up going with it, I'd appreciate if you went into my submissions and used the referral code (it's gets you a discount, and me a $50 gift card to their store).

This is super cool. Is your code on github or openly available somewhere? I’ll be digging through the code snippets on medium as well
Try calculating the average P/E of ARKG
The fact that no other app matches Robinhood’s UI baffles me. I use Robinhood just for my

Youre right about that it has seemed since the clean energy space got a little hype people have been purchasing any stocks just to get skin in the game.

My puts I sold gonna get me in at 25 for PLTR.

Last time I entered a TSLA leap at $400 when it was falling from $520... TSLA dropped to $310 the following week. I actually cried to my girlfriend... but diamond handed that shit.

Hope so. I might just buy at the end of the day and pray it does well into the new year.
I think today is the cheapest level. It could still go to low 13s but that’s way too oversold.
25% down for the week $18,000 lost
Who cares buy the dip.

Just talked to my buddy who has 4 step children ( from 2 different dads) and he got her pregnant with another.   Somethings are worse than being a PLTR bag holder.
Why aren’t you buying more ArkG yet
It would just make them more fair since many are already using them.
refueling for the new years. See you in tendie town next week
Yikes. The week that the democrats will win the senate, instantly decreasing fair values of every US company by 15% with their proposed tax increase? No thanks
Oh my fucking shit dude! Yooooooo!!!!! You are definitely on the spectrum. Robinhood employees are probably having a field day with your portfolio.
I bet gamestop would give you like $15 on a trade in for those awards. In store credit only

Not holding onto MU from earlier in the week a big bummer though
LMAO and whose fault is that, my man? I'm sitting here with the patience of a saint getting ZERO excitement, but you also don't see me shitting bricks and losing money.

YOLO’d my entire Robinhood account on weekly PLTR 24, 25.5, and 27 calls. How did I come up with 27? Simple. 
Palantir was founded 17 years ago, and IPO’d earlier this year at 10$. Take 17, add it to 10, and you get 27.
Tl;dr PLTR to the fucking mooooon 🚀 🚀 🚀

SHould i just sell my FCEL FEB 19 calls?
IMO this is basically the bull case for pltr in the long term (disclaimer: long position therefore bias). I've worked in multiple roles so far in large organizations (a government adjacent one, a regulator, and a private-ish entity) that were/are going through massive technological upgrades in terms of their day to day operations and software setups.


There are so many inefficiencies that disrupt, damage or delay projects and workflows  due to the massive time sink related to reconciling different data silos/users/department records/outputs from different systems. You couple that with how (I suspect that this is common, given the shared experience of other industry counterparts I've had to work with) a non-trivial amount of professional finance and corporate work quite literally runs on cobbled patchwork spreadsheet solutions and recordkeeping , and you can easily see how there's a massive TAM out there.


Having a smart MDM solution that is "dummy proof" to allow analysts or BI people to focus on analyzing rather than cobbling together workflows and cleaning/interpreting data from disparate sources would be a massive gamechanger from a productivity and key man risk/BCP standpoint for a lot of organizations in the middle of tech transformation initiatives.
Honest to god though I hope Mayweather saved some of his fight money.

[deleted]
You know damn well they didn't have two weeks when we bought them
Sell naked calls
"Haha, we're all down this week because we all own the same stupid meme stocks that we did zero DD on. "

We have been pumped and quite possibly dumped

I think we'll see at least some positive turnaround within the next couple of weeks though
GME Gang, we got a problem. We're in the 10th place. Let's work together to fix that shit.
where can i check my monthly/yearly fees on td ameritrade?

ill ask their customer service, their CS is amazing
$325 -> $1,240  on a $700c 12/31... sold super early too but profit is profit
All this shit going down and Tesla just doing a bull flag
What is up with Live Nation?  Almost at pre pandemic levels and still completely non opperational.
Actually true, if your logic consistently makes you lose money just use your logic and inverse it
8800 shares at around 18$, 1 may 2021 12.5$c, 5 jan 2022 10$c

Long dated calls in not retarded companies.

nah, i'm a little risk averse bitch. not buying a leap without a definite pullback
I am but a child, pleas market put down the jumper cables
No.
Too many people saw themselves being roasted in this comment he was literally downvoted for speaking the truth
Someone turn Tim off and back on pls.

Yea

Nice. Partially bought shares just so I could make the money I lost in calls lmao I believe in this company long-term but buying high IV monthlies was just too hard to resist
[deleted]
Yes
It’s ridiculous man. Every time I’m like there’s no way it’ll keep rising, it just keeps going up. 

As soon as I buy I’m sure it’ll drop 😂
Shit I just bought it this week, I’m part of the problem
Feels like everyone is just waiting around for something to happen while others slowly average down.  I know there are massive short positions but we need to BUY CALLS in order to force MM to buy the underlying to cover

What a head fake by FB this morning. I fell for it hook line and sinker and bought the top
Actually small caps gonna fucking drill lol
I'm already long on about 50 shares I bought in the beginning of the spac. So for about 11$.

I do believe they will do well given some time so I'm looking to double down and buy more when I feel like it bottoms out. What's your opinion on when this will probably be? I was honestly expecting it to slightly start rebounding today but it hasn't as of yet.
what I find incredible is TSLA Weeklies.  Like God damn would I love to have 100 shares to sell those.
Hahahha he’s a loose canon!!!
(parents’)
I don't know. I think ATM options are probably okay. I bought some deeper calls for Feburary. I am holding $200 strikes for 2/19/21 which is right after their earnings.
what is the worst that could happen lmao
3x!!!
At least I can read good
DUDE if this isn't a fake screenshot your a madman for holding all the way up to 50 congrats!
BABA.  Maybe

yeah just goto china
I would have taken 2k out and yolo’d the rest to oblivion. I’d still be 1k better off than OP
Good point we definitely need clarification here.
THC 🐝 coming in hot with that stiffy
The post-peak low is 22.50 (also the 1M low), I’m anticipating the price continuing to decline if the price breaks this threshold. Trying to decide if I should hold or sell at 22.50.
PLTR. Pleas fly again. 

Preferably very soon
Stimmy play?
Down 8% for the week. Guess that's not too bad all things considering
Today’s ath, monday’s floor
Peace out

Nice one, congrats, but fuck you
Did you know 2020 was going to be like this last Dec 31?? There’s your answer
It was always a long play tbf
Don’t. Maybe closer to $20-25.
It's going down, I'm yelling *TIMBER*!
And you are retarded
Is market closed tomorrow?
If your not buying the PLTR dip, you ain't black
Thank you for fucking me in the ass Alex karp. Happy new year.
Everyone, BUY 4/20 PLATINUM CALLS🚀🚀🚀
I just got NIO calls hoping to sell sometime before EOD, any predictions for NIO EOD?
🤡🤡🤡
Hey that’s me

Down over 50% now on a couple short seller reports. Good time to buy. Next ROKU maybe.
I was going to buy more GME shares today no matter what, the tweets though just helped pump my cock harder as I did it.
[deleted]
Buy it now 🤷🏻‍♂️ shit will recover if it does go down
GME rockettt is back
105k profit.  Too bad a lot of that money is the kids college funds.
You know why I'm here, and so do I
add it to the list
Redeem my PLTR 1/15 40c for $11 or ride till I die back to 40? Cost was $760.
If I get 10 awards I will start buying gme!!!

honestly you have my respect. balls of a fucking Greek God.
Still delusions of winning it all back
Yeah my baba calls are hurtin
We should have a who's the biggest retard of the year award.

Well congratulations you're the first one to win it!
I sure hope PLTR bounces back next year 🙏
Really wanna try to catch that FUBO knife...

Meme stocks absolutely wrecked today good lord
I make money every week because I'm not retarded enough to play WSB meme stock. Autism is more powerful than the fundamentals of the underlying.
[deleted]
What was the duration? And don't come at me with 2 weeks or less bro. You know that wasn't gonna ever work.
Expect a correction. It may start on Wednesday if Democrats win Georgia.
If it ever dips again
What makes you think ur gonna be right now?

Once in lifetime event.....





That will continue to 2021 !!!
Sold my PLTR calls and converted to shares. Lesson learned: don't fall for pump efforts on this sub for a stock that's run up 300% in a few months
Well if you don't pay the taxes then yes
It’s like nothing happened in 2020
Ilysm
cuz they’re a trash stock that went up too quick
It's an EFT though so nothing to worry about.
When I go from -90% to -70% I feel like the smartest guy in here. I bought the dip mother fuckers!!#!@#!@#!
[deleted]
Stop trying at this point. I’m jumping back in at 20 or less.
PLTR 30c 3/19/21

$250 and has .4 delta

Looks like a solid play
why do you do this, and make me cry more?
I would definitely be in favor of that!

You got it man, it‘s a world in itself, 'innit? Enjoy the memes, profits and inevitable losses - it‘s all gonna be worth it in the end.
I was still able to read the message you scribbled
I am just a gay cub but those calls look yummy. Is it too late to hibernate in these calls?
Shut off your internet and change the locks
💎hands baby. You will be rewarded greatly
I trade corn stalks
There will never be a year quite like it ever again.

There will certainly be some more insanity, we just don't know what.
Once the aliens arrive there will be another crash!
gosh im so hard thinking about buying the next TSLA dip with a Leap. probably will kill the stonk at that point
We will see. I think as we dig into covid recovery, growth stocks like these may take a hit as money would transition back to traditional stocks that had their business hammered throughout covid.
Is this the most awarded post on Reddit ever?
I’m getting knocked to the floor
[deleted]
Oh wait let me guess, dump to $371.40, then pump right back to flat $372?
Said like a true retard. Those aren’t the only two options available. Term limits on these fossils would go a long way in helping with some of the flaws in the current system.

[deleted]
Aww Did Somone buy fds and not calls set after earnings
Well it just so happens that I agree with you. Deleting it now.
Yeah it’s getting hit hard right now and I also expected the bleeding to stop but I guess expected with its crazy 3 month run.  Everything is hurting this week so that doesn’t help either. Hopefully it can make a base in this range, seems to do this big run up then cool off quickly trend.  Once merger (early Jan hopefully) happens it should run, it’s a solid company dominating this market.
[deleted]
Why did tsla volatility spike just now. I bought calls at 2.22 at 716 over an hour ago. They just spiked to 3.23 when it hit 716 again. Instantly sold and they are back to 3.0 and decreasing.
Am I the only one who thinks athletes should be allowed to take steroids?

That would make sports more fun to watch. And therefore stonks go up.

Moves before market close???
YOUR bottom
Yeah I lost a fuck ton on them on Tuesday
FUBO Fucked U By Options
Haha, we're all down this week because we all own the same stupid meme stocks that we did zero DD on. 

In these situations, all you have to do is wait. Don't sell your options until you have 2 weeks remaining on them. No need to worry at all.
Yo can I have an award?
#🍆🧎🏻
Just keep cheering from the sidelines, thanks
That one is hype... No business...
Ngl I feel more comfortable on red days, it feels like home
Now would be a good time to take profits
It's not impossible for pltr to run again.
I have all 5
When will moderna stop this bleeding?
No one knows with a new stonk. Less than a $2B mkt cap with a huge addressable market. Lots like a good risk reward trade off. Just look at ROKU for what this stonk may do in a few months.
Dude. You need to go to /r/personalfinance, then /r/GamblingAddiction, then /r/investing and stick to the fucking indexes. This clearly isn't for you.

Once it got to a certain point nobody cared anymore.  I got roasted before on a different subreddit for saying the US would hit 300k by next spring, not even this month but here we are.

In NY we have people driving to Pennsylvania to fly to their vacations and cruises because the covid testing and quarantine is too inconvenient for them.  Numbers are going to keep climbing.
Bruh fucking Denny's mooned today..... Literally everything else in my portfolio is blood red, and this shit hole that I just found out about two days ago and added to a watchlist fucking moons😕😕😕
Godspeed autist! 👏🏿
My for fun calls expired worthless lol
Elon plays the market like a fuckin maestro. Stock goes down on worries about end of year numbers? Musk “leaks” internal email saying they’ll hit 500k, and another saying we need to cut costs...stock zooms. He’s the future of CEOs using social media to pump good PR and stock price. Get on board or get out of his way.
Ouf... Why didn't you buy the dip? Why buy 700 and no dca bruh
I get it though. Sometimes you get antsy to make a move and generate some cash flow. But two weeks and not that far out in price can fuck you over - happened to many many times on volatile stocks that tend to pop out of nowhere. At the end of the day, if OP bought them cheap enough and his return would be satisfactory, then I guess it's fine.
Shares $13.50! Calls getting wrecked...
Damn bro you could’ve bought a house
Red days are unconstitutional
I'm new here can somebody please explain to me what EOD stands for
Up 40% overall. 
Did a mix of stocks and options. Just bought tech stocks, airlines, retail on dips with calls in parallel. Some wins, some losses.
Im up 2k on my +1 665c 1/15/20

Yeah me too rip my weekly put
Because of its market cap. Give it a few months. People will come around to it once it breaks $1 billion market cap.
Are you trying to tell me my 1/15/21 $60c won't print??
$1000 is conservative. My money is on $6900
Any upcoming catalysts?
Man you get triggered real easy huh?
Any other solar technology companies that are low and up-and-coming that you've seen? No sense buying in high when it's at $175. I've learned my lesson multiple times on that 😂
Trading this week was super trash for me. Down about 7k this week smh.

Should’ve went all in on TSLA lol
This is beautiful.
600$ in fucking fees today, but my net is wide and my eod gains are set to be considerable
Any idea regarding targets?
GME 40c makes leap spreads pretty good right?
Leveraged to the motherfuckin tatas
Holy shit. Calm down Chad Dickens.

Getting absolutely thrashed I wish it closed early today.
First-year trading, have always been the "invest and forget" type of guy but found a whole another level of thrill when I made my first trade on $PK this year and woke up 5% ($1k) in profits literally the next day... I cashed out and treated the fam to a massive dinner, only to watch that stock go from $5.75 when I bought back in the first week of April to $15 plus. My initial investment of $20k would now be $60k, and I've only got $5k to show for it in profits. I also had quite a few freakouts after taking some hefty losses on $PK and similar stocks (specifically $MTDR) and I stopped trading in May and resumed in August.

After $PK and $MTDR freakouts, I stopped trading "risky" stocks because I didn't like the risk/reward ratio they came with and began trading tech stocks instead. While doing this, I wrote myself an algorithm to determine overbought/oversold levels and plotted that on TradingView charts. I also upped my initial position to $35k back in August and have slowly climbed to $12k in profits in the last 5 months, averaging slightly more than $2k a month and a 5% return monthly. I have no doubt I'll hit it in January too. It's made me confident enough to up my total trading capital by another $30k and now have slightly over $75k that can be invested at any given time. Overall, I am up 30% on my trading in the last 5 months.

I've learned a lot this year, about trading, patience, strategies on when to enter, why/when to exit, and most importantly... what to enter. It's no secret (and you can tell by looking at my numbers) that WSB outdoes me 100% of the time when it comes to gains, but I think people here forget that consistency is the most important thing. Being up 1000% one month and then down 80% the next month is not a ride for a person like me. I can be down 10% on $AMZN (and have been a few times), but I have over 87% win ratio on that stock because I strongly believe in what/when/why I buy it. **So, here's a list of some rules I made for myself:**

* **Trade instruments that I understand.** If it's options, then trade options, if it's shares, then trade shares.
* **Trade companies I believe in** or have personally been in contact with. Every company I buy, I either use or know someone in my immediate circle who uses it.
* **FOMO and greed are not the same.** As the saying goes, "greed is good" but FOMO most definitely isn't. Greed means you're salivating because of the money. FOMO is salivating because everyone else is salivating, in other words its a jealousy of sorts.
* **Consistency over grandeur.** I am okay missing out on 100%/week gains. It doesn't phase me any more than being down 10% on a good company. I couldn't care less about either of those scenarios.
* **Don't go for or against memes.** Writing calls against $TSLA is as stupid as buying $900C back in August. The potential of such a thing happening is great, but the probability is against you and I'm not on the roulette table here.
* **The ability to filter through the noise is important.** /r/wallstreetbets is by far the best stock-market related subreddit or forum in general. But the diamonds are almost always buried a thousand posts deep into $GME and $XPEV posts. People who made money on memes, you are the reason I come here, and I love you and I hope you make all the money there is in the market... but people with solid DDs are the reason I stay here. This place is both informative and entertaining, compared to /r/stocks and /r/investing, which are almost always neither.

2020 opened my eyes. Before, I was risk-averse, probably because I didn't truly understand the risks. Now, though I'm still risk-averse, I love trying to get a grip on what is happening. $BABA is a very risky investment as evident by countless posts everywhere on /r/wallstreetbets, /r/stocks, /r/investing, and so on... yet it is my largest position. 

And to conclude, here is a list of my current positions;

* 70 shares of $BABA at an average of $245 with a price target of $265, where I'll liquidate unless the political environment gets better.
* 70 shares of $CRM at $221 with a price target of $230  
(have made this same play quite a few times in the last 2 months)
* 24 shares of $FB at $273 with a price target of $280  
(also done multiple times during the last few months)
* 4 shares of $AMZN at $3250 with a price target of $3350  
(have made a bit over $5k only trading swings between $3000 and $3350)
* 275 shares of $PFE at average $38.62 with a price target of $41-42, not sure how this will go. Have made this play once before when I cashed out at $42.75 just a few weeks ago.

**Hope you all get your RH accounts to 1000x in 2021.**

I’m being a little bitch because someone more deserving took all my marbles. I learned some important lessons for next time. And actually I might not do so badly after I shave off some taxes with those losses.
lol yup
Long WMT. Even boomers have learned how to order online now. AMZN and WMT are literally free money right now.

Averaged up last week now I'm averaging down

FUBO sounds like FUBAR. And there does appear to be a relationship between the two.

But there are no good news this time :(
Well this inspires me to never do what you just did. So that’s something. Head up though. Lesson learned the hard way for you. Now it’s something you won’t repeat
is ToS fucking up for anyone else lately
I know. But I am definitely exposed to that market. Perhaps a little more than I'd like.
All in on calls if that happens, especially the .69 death part, first sign of turning people into a vegetable.

don't forget our dear pltr and dash (not going down)
I added some more shares today but think I’ll continue DCA’ing as long as it stays below $25. I’d love to get a few hundred shares and sell covered calls but only have 26 shares for now :/
But fed gov then steps in to provide jobs that are no longer in the economy until businesses can get going again and create jobs.

I can’t lose on PLTR because I never plan on selling. Lol I average down every time it dips by scalping calls and selling otm weeklies for a couple shekels

Personal experience: 8 years ago I looked at putting 1K into Ford or Tesla. I chose Ford because I was a little bitch and Tesla wasn't profitable. Will always regret. And it has driven me to better plays and you guys here at WSB. 

You go smol PP r/dividends, make those bread crumbs.
What are the moves?
I think we continue to see asset inflation but minimal CPI inflation for things like groceries. 

The music does really stop when interest rates pop up though (not till 2023)
Pass... hope the bags aren’t too heavy
They’re best competition is waymo. The auto industry is probably not going to replicate what Tesla did because it will take them years and why would you buy anything but a self driving car if a self driving car is available during that time?
Lmao ARKK is now in the top 5 most held stocks by Robinhood users.

So what do I buy
Thats not what people mean when they say dividend stock. Tons pay dividends of some amount. A 0.6% dividend from apple isnt going to be on the radar of anyone looking to buy dividend stocks.
thats how i feel about 90% of my calls xD
I feel like everyone knows that already
Also 26$. I am one stupid mofo.
Jesus pltr do something

That kind of buy could help if focused at the right time
Everything in this market is weird just don’t question it for your own sanity
At least my PSTH calls are looking good
Haha fantastic meme!
Not to mention, green energy isn't even close to inflated. Imagine a balloon that you have only just blown your first breath into.
Nice, thinking of scooping up some that are down today myself. I maybe over extended my SPAC involvement and they're all still positive, just red this week and its bumming me out
what a shitty trading day, I'm hoping for a big green dildo soon

Add a 0 to the end of those numbers and you’re me.
Go ahead, keep getting your profits. I’ll take the assignment and pick up $TNA shares entering into the new year. Only up from here for small caps. 

If rotation is real, huge wave of buying incoming.
If rotation isn’t here, then stonks go up.

I can’t lose.
Bingo
Why
My humble, small take on PLTR. It just has too much meme potential to not take off. I know that's not a very scientific or fundamental way of looking at things, but there's just too much psychological sentiment constantly whirling around it, as if it's a hurricane slowly forming ready to decimate all shorts and puts.
2021 Prediction: TSLA 1500 end of 2021. And in 2021 more big car companies will stumble and fail at EV in the US. Musk will troll them with memes and tweets.
Tesla can’t stop won’t stop
Tsla the new tsla
After close today I’ll have 1000 shares at 25.70
2021 i’m going to break my gambling addiction and anxiety from it
  
because i don’t have anything left to gamble

You can get Irish citizenship after a certain number of years residence. Not every Irish citizen was born there.
Day trading TSLA saved my ass from my stupid ass OSTK and FUBO plays.
Someone tell me to let go of my 20 dollar GME calls
He bought? Damp it.
Keep doing it the MMS are having a blast
And when you say “dude” what does that mean?
I hope everyone realises that TSLA is going to reach $1000... The meme potential cannot be beaten - no one actually gives a fuck about what they do or how much they sell its PURELY a way for everyone to get rich by 'pretending' its actually a solid investment at such retarded valuations like now.
FUBO back to 15-20
At least you can make some tax deductions

LGVW PLTR THC 🐝 really are lessons in profit taking

And yet there is TSLA
PLTR has bottomed out several times around the $23.80 mark, looks to have formed a support point near there. Tough to tell on low volume though.
\*surveys all the mistakes he made this year\* At least... I never sold TSLA.
Very similar to my story except that last number is about $300. An expensive way to learn there are better ways at making 6 figures a year without being a wage slave.
Meh I'll take that any day instead of that winnie the pooh system
I didn't even get the 75$.  Still salty about that.
Well at least you won’t have to worry about taxes.

TRUTH! I took it upon myself to learn. I'm a 21 year old college student with a $10k portfolio with some cushion in my savings.
If dems win the market will rocket. The market knows that means huge infrastructure bill, lots of stimulus, $2k checks in the hands of their customers, all of it. If GOP wins its four years of austerity and temporarily pretending to care about deficits.

yea im gonna hold off actually i feel like it could go up in the short term
C’mon FEYE!
I just doubled up my long shares. Wouldn't buy FDs at this point though.
I don’t understand how this shit can be down this much

I mean I guess I just don’t understand how the spac got so high then
Turd pleas float
Hope i get to your level soon, I started in November with $500
You need to be born in the north to get Irish citizenship dude. Irelands had the common travel area with UK since independence though so Ireland treats UK citizens with better rights than EU citizens and vice versa, basically was set up for the anglo irish ruling class to go back to the uk post indepedence.
Thinking of moving to a high beta ETF because clearly that's me
Any awards I get I'll double and put that money into GME shares
I made $900 which I used to buy more PLTR shares 

I mean I want to hold long term and I think some day it will go way over $27

Honestly I think he’d try to transfer it’s jurisdiction to Mars. Sure he could try to take over Earth or he could have one of the biggest companies on Earth but the undisputed biggest company on Mars. That essentially provides him with dominance on two planets.
Especially since this will probably not 2x overnight. More realistically this will end up in the $40-ish area. In which case you lost $300 worth of potential profit.

Based on the options chain the majority of the money thinks it will be <700 by 2023. The numbers don't lie
Did you hear a saying by someone here? “The faster it goes up the harder it falls”?
U still have some 💵 left you can make it back
They make the least $, as well. 🧐
Should had 💎🖐🤚
So BABA calls?
27
Not really.  Just feels better getting it out of my system and telling people.
Saw this segment. To be fair this was his dividend picks
Basically you are assuming a massive outflow would happen. The simplicity of the SP500 even if a drawn down happens to Tesla and Enph (which is still an underwhelming percentage of the whole) that those funds to a point would rebalance to most likely other companies in the SP500 negating a lot of the downside. What you are purpose would need a full on crash and outflow of money from the overall market. Not just a green energy burst.
I'm right at 26 as well. My original shares got called away so I bought back in and have been buying every dip. Currently at 1.2k shares now.
how do i do this
800$ In doing my part lol

Unless you have gains to offset the losses, you can deduct only 3k of that 15k loss and carry forward the rest. Better than nothing I suppose.
Happy New Year bro
I'm sorry, but rearranging your stock broker's face is frowned upon in this establishment.
Are PLTR calls for next week a no brainer? Even just for the meme value?
AMZN why
The underlying securities need to stop pussying out.
FUBO call : right now. 

SELL it : EOD

thank me : at midnight tonight with a Champaign bottle.
$8k PLTR leaps. 🧎
samesies. Remind me to dump my entire portfolio to cash a week before new years before profit takers show up.
Ok lmao i don't think this sub is that extreme. Most are just meming and they're buying pltr because they do believe in it. Pltr still very undervalued in my opinion

Mine does too. It’s normal.

It's definitely gonna pump today, it's pretty much a guarantee at this point. Everyone sold, got some realized losses, markets gonna moon on Monday so everyone gonna purchase EOD
oh shiii 🚀🚀🚀
Aww you poor thing. It’ll be alright, we all know how great you are in here at the very least.

TSLA Jan call go up quickly in last 10 min while stock price didn't move at all?

What is happening?
How old are you? Seriously?  If dems win the senate the market will drop 2-3% instantly and be on a downtrend from there.  More money in the economy isn't better at this point.  We want limited money in 2021 to keep things going.  Otherwise Stagflation starts and that's really bad for the market.

I’m taking wsb public at 420, ticker GANG.
I'm not saying that TESLA will never reach 1000$ or that this is the absolute top. But there is going to be a correction.
After banging my head against the wall time and again. I think I finally realize that if a stock is up 12% in a day you should buy puts and not buy calls.
ARKK Needs to pump
Maybe now is the time to GO EV? Lol.
Their webpage made it look like a wholly American company. Research shows it's obv a Chinese company but the us entity including stock listing is a different entity than the Chinese listing, however I bet it's the same owner(s) at the end of the day.

I go back and forth because they have a product on the market. Like it or not China is about a decade ahead of the West in terms of EV adoption, even if their technology isn't particularly advanced. They are pumping them out, their affordable, and they fill a need. It reminds me of Kia in the 90s in that they were kinda shit, everyone knew they were kinda shit, but you bought it bc it's cheap and it works. Kia grew and adapted. I wonder if kandi will do that too. But I honestly believe they have a leg up right now and that will put them in a good position in the next 1-4 years. I dunno about after that though.

Yeah, maybe less so, but yeah.

People sell off for tax, less businesses doing... stuff, less trading...  if your relatively flat in the last week of the year, that's a good sign heading into January. People gonna want to buy up their plays for the year.
People that downvote can't handle the truth
Heads up I sold $27 covered calls for PLTR for Jan 15,2021. (1200 shares as collateral) 

Get ready for a +20% week to fuck me 

Always inverse me, always 

Buy PLTR calls now

Well this is a new thing I learned.  I sold the 12 covered calls but I just tried to buy them to close my positions but Robinhood said I don’t have the buying power. So now I can’t even buy these back to close my positions.  

I love learning new things
Y'all need to stop buying 1/15 calls as theta is going to kill you when you're so far OTM. If you're going for $30c then look into 02/19/21's, lower IV at the moment (which will of course rise into Dec. sales) and 35 extra days so theta doesn't murder ya as the catalysts are past the 1st week in January. 

Or just buy shares, but I've got enough of those and have extra powder to throw at options in a few of my accounts.

Horde: 16k shares & {calls} 50x 1/15 ($13/$15), 20x calls 2/19 ($20), 70x 4/16 ($15/20), 45x 7/16 ($20) 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

The world is like a ride in an amusement park. And when you choose to go on it you think it's real because that's how powerful our minds are. And the ride goes up and down and round and round. It has thrills and chills and it's very brightly colored and it's very loud and it's fun, for a while. Some people have been on the ride for a long time and they begin to question: "Is this real, or is this just a ride?" And other people have remembered, and they come back to us, they say: "Hey, don't worry, don't be afraid, ever, because this is just a ride."

Good luck bruh.
congrats and fuck you
2 for 9 post merger. Yes.
Use the same strategy she uses. Just google for companies that are active in that industry. Simple.
Not realistic as the 2nd guy still has a roof over his head.

Where is Papa Karp. He will give us tendies in the 1st Q of 2021
okay? so am I. To say that great stocks don't experience downtrends is laughable.
$1000 would be a stack of 10 $100 bills, which I’m certain you’ve never seen before. But if it helps to visualize, it would be the same height as 10 $1 bills.

Wow, you bought the top. Will you add when it hits $16s?
Thought on where the price target will go?
You’re talking about a company that forgot to code in day light savings causing their whole system to be brought down on the largest intra Day swing on record.
hey Cathie funny prank, we get it. you can go back into +10% a day now
I got mine
On Robinhood, +44% with mostly MSFT/KO shares and QQQ options. Biggest miss was selling all my SNAP leaps just before the price doubled because nobody I know irl uses Snapchat anymore. Going to get real familiar with GME + PLTR so I can keep making option plays on them in the coming months.

On M1, +51% with 3x funds and monthly deposit + rebalance. Adding $40k worth of margin to the pie to accelerate the gainz even further.
PLTR please. I don’t want 800 shares.
Volume on TSLA fairly low - setting up for a big end of day buy or sell?
Hi Matt
I’m speaking hyperbolically man lol. Just saying despite any short term dips you’re gonna come out ahead regardless because it recoups those losses almost instantly

People worrying about the big crash, just look at this. There’s absolutely no way with this level of printing. The m1 supply has no where to go but equities.

Pretty hyped for 50-60 range post merger, may dip a bit when they finally merge - that seems to happen lately. I got in at 33 and held on through run to 49 like an idiot.  Now I’m just hanging at this point. overall this is good company 5 years+
You need to read more and watch some YouTube videos breaking down how calls work.

There was a big dip last week. It has corrected itself but it definitely dipped.
Proud of WSB today. Only green stocks are TSLA and GME
Seems like the best time left this year to buy PLTR.
Nice to know, MC integration helps solve a bunch of the pain in the ass stuff for me.
There is a possibility of that being true
They would be offset by the capital losses though
It is

I don’t understand why fedex is going down. They should still be going up. Solid company. Record profits. Makes no sense.
Didn’t read, just doubled down on PLTR tho. Very cool.
Interesting fact about Brexit: because there won’t be a hard boarder in Ireland, you could essentially move from England to Northern Ireland then move to the Republic. Once you’re there you could wait until you qualify for a passport then move somewhere else in the EU. What I’m trying to say is Ireland is somehow all in the U.K. and all in the EU now.
Added some shares today and averaged down to 25.

pretty boring day. time for videogaymes
Hey, I just joined you on the good side of options.

Do you by chance know how this works on a cash account?  
I'm now short a call and hold 100 stock. So if price goes through the roof I make 40%. What I'm concerned about is if it doesn't. Can I actually still sell the shares (have a SL order that would actually fill). Or do I need to buy back the call first, then sell the shares? Not quite sure how that is handled.

Anyhoot, first time being on the good side of options and it feels just as great as I had imagined it.
Marie kondo is just jealous.

I use WeBull with a cash account, I sell everything during the day and buy dips in either ICLN / TSLA / FNGU / ARKK then sell once it revs up. I don’t really hold positions longer than a few hours.

Up 79k or 144%. As recent as Oct 27 I was down 14k. Some of my plays:

-15 $352C SPY FDs for Pfizer vaccine pump
-5000 shares of FCEL with an average cost basis of $2.60
My first thought as well.
Can't argue with that logic my man! True WSB fashion, love it, have a tendie blessed 2021!

? Uh, the letter does not say that he (Cohen) or GME lost 500M. The letter does mention, however, that GME's sales, EBITDA, and net income have gone down over the years. The company is clearly not growing as it is, but it has not 'lost 500M'. It is still quite profitable. There is a big difference. The 500M in cash is related to their balance sheet, which is public information:

https://news.gamestop.com/financial-information/fundamentals/balance-sheet

They have also paid off over 125m in debts that will allow investors to not be restricted in long purchases.


All of these things are in the posts that I linked

Just a thought, but take a look at their S1 and investor presentations. They’ll give you a good idea of what they’ll do and might prevent a paper-hands loss on a sale of shares at a low point. I’m long 100k in shares. It hurts to lose 20k in a few days, but I’m not selling.
That is a lot of terms that really mean
"We can't compete with Amazon, best buy, Target, Walmart, and every other better big box store selling everything we do for better prices and better service." What technologies are they developing? Every overvalued stock always has some grand plan for the future, and until they show me proof it is overvalued. 

Lets check back in a year on the value aye? If it 25% higher you get to call me a retard and vice versa.

Bruh have you just got here?
To be honest this was the point where I realized it was a good deal. Cohen buying in essentially cemented the bulk thesis. From what I can see Cohen is an absolute bulldog, and his going over 10% ownership confirmed it. We are buying into a Ryan Cohen gaming e-commerce company at about 1b market cap. Of course this assume he is successful in implementing his vision, but based on what I’ve read about him, he will be successful.

I, personally, am investing in Cohen and making sure I take part in the continued expansion of gaming, which I think Cohen will make sure GameStop is positioned to do in the future.
It's become more and more radically left wing.
This is the way. The WSB way

Same. At this rate I’m gonna own more baba calls than all my other calls in my entire history combined
The market is closed tmr retard
Agreed. I plan on exercising on most of my calls and going ITM for more conservative plays. This isn’t a meme stock and that’s exactly what I like about it. I feel like it’s a reliable growth I can count on to then gamble away my profits.

Baba
same story. Started options in Feb. Down 50%. Sad to see that most of my positions would've made good money had I been more patient or had much further out expirys.

Going into 2021 I'm shifting my strategy to composition consisting almost purely of: ICLN, TAN, LIT, BOTZ, ARKF, ARKK, ARKG. These stocks literally don't go down. Going the ETF route with sprinkled promising memes like NIO
MUST. NOT. BUY. 0DTE. LOTTO. TICKETS.
He bought?
Pre split
You cheated
wait, I really gotta explain this?

There are index funds of almost anything. So the range of returns is basically anything. Obviously i was referring to the total market, which is the most common index-fund investing strategy, which has been like 17% for SP500, 20% for Russell 2000.
Agree 100%, fuck both parties
Yep. Sleeping very well on my yolo icln 7/16’s
I think it's pretty obvious it's going to crater until after the employee lockup period ends.  Then rise over time.  I felt all the posts on here were hype to keep that from happening and to find suckers to buy or hold
This is the way... to ropeville
He lost it all this year
I learned the hard way a couple times in TSLA history that there very well might not be a dip. Waiting for a dip is only worth it for day trading and FDs imo. If you’re buying shares or leaps, just get in
NIO is a sleeper. Very cheap. Fair value $100.

The 0 day $50 calls are a nice shot
What expiration?
This whole fucking month has been a complete fucking turd Jesus Christ I was making more in a week in every other month this year than the entire month of December. Fuck off with this tax bullshit and let’s get to fucking January already
Guys. Please shut the fuck up about PLTR. I literally hear you guys bitch about losing money on it every fucking trading day.

Btw holy shit that random 2% dip what the hell lol
Nope, it’s up another 10k or so
[deleted]
You started near the bottom of the biggest run in stock market history and you're down 82%?

For 2021, stick with calls and only buy options at minimum 1 month out and once you're up a good amount, sell some to secure some profits and set a stop loss for the rest where you original bought.
Da fuk dey doin’ over here?
What about AAPL?

That’s the bond market dummy
0dte is always retarded. Buying lottery tickets is a bad investment. Even the guy who hits that jackpot only hits it cause he made a retarded investment and got lucky. 

That being said I’d rather be lucky than good in this market.

I ain’t fucking selling.
What did I miss, why has it been going down this week?
I love you all, thanks for keeping me company this year 🥺 happy new year traders

Shit year, actually.  Only 46%, got murdered in September during the tech crash, had options, completely worthless after 8 days, and I didn't even have access to my workstation during the crash to try and stem the loss.

Lesson learned: travel not with 3mo/45DTE options open, lighten speculative positions during travel.
Go figure some a holes here where completely wrong and aggressively spreading false news
Bring on the awards for OP!
think pltr will take us here in 7 years??

I’m with there lol; I wholly believe it’s a company to sit on for years tbh. So even if you got stuck bag holding, you aren’t screwed as long as you hold

baba baby
I mean so technically you’re just down about $944
Give her time. Once these states realize they can get some much needed tax revenue from sports betting this will fly. In addition, getting into e sports betting market can be a nice tailwind. That’s what I keep telling myself.
PLTR
Down 26% it was a shitty month, was expecting Moderna, Curevac and Biontech to perform better once the vaccines are out but nope
[removed]
34
So that the 140 puts expire worthless, MMs did it a couple Fridays ago at 150 too. But that time, the IPO was still fresh so lots of investors seemingly saw it as a sign and fomoed in, making the stock moon suddenly.

Gotta get that sweet dividend
Are you accusing me of using terribly distasteful satire to attain fake Internet points?
There goes my last 2k, down 5k this month and I’m taking the last $200 out. See you guys in a couple months while I get some more cash from work😅
Naked two day puts, what could have gone wrong
Pleas, all these words do absolutely nothing in contributing to my confirmation bias (thanks autists!) that GME is gonna rocket!!

The question is not whether I buy more ICLN leaps, the question is how many?
Yes...that’s how much I’ll have left in the bank after my 800 shares assignment.
DASH puts? eod or on a small pump?
Buy more TSLA or wait for a dip?
The manipulation is hilariously obvious. They do not want to see 20eod
I hope he does it before my calls expire in 2.5 hours
Oh yay AAPL being sold again because buyers are scared of having to deal with FUCKING KANGAROO BULLSHIT

You only lost $1K.   


Not bad...
WTF? market is open all day??? I thought it's half day today
Not when talk like that you do, retard
*just came up with a new pump and dump scheme*
You probably got $600 coming soon. There’s still hope
Gave up two weeks of gains trying to scalp a quick TSLA downturn.. lol. So dumb lol. Fuck it!

ICLN, QCLN, GME, MSOS, BFT going into the new year. Excited to go into '21 with you tards.
I want awards baby.

Man, I hope sometime next year my portfolio will attract the Morgan chick from CNBC.

I really really want her to sit on my face one day while i make some bad financial decisions.
You have time to type this comment but can't Google? If they were closing early they would be closed by now.

Awards goin out easy today
I told people to buy them when they were only 300$ and yet I still did not myself.
Can’t believe they paid so much for him
Valuations dont matter anymore, market is detached from reality. Dont trade based on fundamentals
Betting on a big green day on Monday - catalyst being that it's not fucking 2020 anymore
It's so low it might change currency
Wait so if I don't sell it I didn't lose it?  Oh shit boys! I'm back in the game!
HOLD THE LINEEEE 📈🚀💰

I usually wish that everybody in this sub would profit, but I'm actually happy that these doomer cucks have lost so much money. Hopefully you even shorted Tesla like other tslaq retards and contributed to our wins.
positions to load up on before market closes? Haven't done weeklies in awhile and I want to make some plays on Jan 8 calls today. why? because i'm retarded and feeling a YOLO today
maybe stop playing 10x OTMs and weeklies and buy 1-2 ITM leaps and see how they print
[deleted]
Just buy some with a small position
Lord Pump Cohen. I hear if you place your lips on his nutsack and suckle long enough, the price of GME rises a few points
Boring asssss dayyyy
Feels good to be green, even .04%, on a red day
He said he didn't
ARKG oof
I got cucked 2 weeks ago and this year end sell off has just cucked me again. My ass cheeks have been spread so wide I don't think I can sit down for a month. All in BTAQ 💵💵
Nothing more boring than bagholding a shit ton of shares
Show me one stonk in the history of all stonk who managed to hold parabolic gains like theses.

Many have failed down the road and many more will fail.

 But the one who is going to successfully short/buy puts at the top of this absolute meme stocks is going to ascend into another dimension.
Bought more this morning.  It's now my largest position next to PLTR and NIO.  Let's go!
Found the guy who doesn’t have TSLA in there portfolio
I feel bad for all the low lifes that spent so much money on awards
Just buy it
Tsla the tool to keep spy up got it

Market's closed then dingbat
But most things are down right now
Every time I want to buy Tesla I can’t make myself do it, and then a week later I regret it. This has been happening for almost two years now... is there therapy available?
[deleted]
Bamboozled
it doesn't make me feel worse at least.
Grab some MU, it’s earnings next week.  MU has not recovered since the 2000s.
the more YT you watch, the better for GOOG. buy calls and then watch
This guys so.fucking under its horrific
It’s a fair perspective and cautionary tale. I don’t disagree and can’t speak to the fate of how that could play out. But I tend to look past the caution and risk, and let my stop limits save me. Risk mitigation and bear perspectives always fuck me, personally. But confidence in actual value (and sometimes memes) has been a consistent win, and I’ve never felt so confident in another position.
These individuals have been quite blessed these past few weeks.  ⛪⛪⛪
Sold all my sony my grandpa gave me to buy pltr weeklies
Why not sell the call options and collect the $327k? Genuine question.
Cohen mods wsb
It’s might actually be. However we may be entering a literal hell where it just trades flat for a month.
Tastyworks, schwab, tos
Are you short puts? That could be profitable
“Its ok to see a little weakness because it already doubled since IPO”

I don't have any awards but if I did I'd probably blow it on something stupid. Just know this is an A+ meme by including power rangers you retard
adamantium fucking hands 

congrats bro
This is the same story for all the "winners" YOLO'ing on options. You're just one of the first to post about it when you've lost it all. It's like the old lady putting pennies in the casino slots. As soon as she wins it'll go right back to "win" more.
welp thats why we don't put 90% in one position.... but Im net long about 25% of portfolio and feel good about the position in mid term, def could be painful in near term
Up 5% one day, down 7% the next, up 1% the next day, down 10% the next, up 5% the next day, down 20% the next. 


Fucking horse shit.
Cringe
wtf I def would have played stuff differently.

New years is a scam. We have been brainwashed

I mean the fact you have consistently lost over this year is genuinely astonishing. Hope 2021 is much better
No, they are middle class at best.  I live at home still.  Cook at the restaurant for about 10 bucks an hour.

PLTR is basically insured by the US gov
Yikes. Now this is the loss porn I like to see
I (kind of) understand the physical side of computers and cloud in general, I’m behind on software and analytics so my problem is trying to understand “what is a good price for PLTR”.

That said thanks for the feedback, not that I was worried they were a pump and dump but it’s nice to hear a company isn’t a sham working out of a shed.
*WSB simultaneously starts dumping $WBA just to prevent this travesty*
L'Hôspital? Monsieur, il est Wendy's.
I'm sorry dude, I'm definitely against you on this one, I think we see 720 by the EOD at least.  If the FOMO kicks in and people start purchasing, we might see 725.

Fuck NIO go up already
Yo literally fucking stop you utter morons go donate to kids in africa or cancer or some shit holy fuck
Just think that you only lost 1k brodur
Just read some mind blowing stock analysis at yahoo finance

"CRM stock price dropped about $50 on news of Slack merger. This amounts to over $40 billion decline in total market capitalization of the stock. The deal with Slack was valued at $27 billion. So Slack is being valued at -$13 billion by the stock market! Of course, that is impossible. Slack has positive value. This means CRM is way undervalued right now. Will return to $270 range soon."
So am i getting shares of the merger company or na?
If your life savings are $10k you should be dreaming about having a retirement account, not millions in the YOLO account
Do half wait 3 hours and see how you feel
you can post on reddit but you can't fuckin google something that would be faster?

Jesus do people fucking expect to buy the stock and for the short squeeze to happen the next day?   


Just buy stocks, set price alert to $30, and then forget about it!   


It's not like GME is gonna go bankrupt right at a console launch cycle, so don't worry! And both Sony and Microsoft are planning to shorten console lifecycles anyway, so the next launch is like prob 4-5 years away max.
wrong way tho...
Paper hands.
Ok boomer
If they introduce negative interest rates, I’m taking out the biggest personal loan of my life for SPY $500 May calls. I don’t see them doing that quite yet, the banks still need to lower their lending standards and the fed can incentivize that for them, so banks get more free taxpayer dollars.
You're wasting too much time arguing with me instead of doing your research and continuously doubling your $25, just 16 times to be a millionaire! You can do it and save your mom from her life as a crack whore.
TSLA carrying me. 

PLTR killing me as usual.
Yeah. I'm holding my synthetic until it expires in 2023. Way too much hype on this stock for it to stay still... And too much demand for the tech too.
Dip to put my puts back itm first pls.
I never do my due diligence every time I have the stock does the complete opposite of my conclusion fuck DD Tesla to the moon

I’m down 82% 

In my defense I’m a newb. Started trading in March for first time. My strategy is obviously wack. Trying to switch it up and be more patient. Algorithms have milked all my calls dry consistently. I’m really hoping to turn it around.... GeT rIcH oR dIe CrYiNg

Apparently you are ... but it will close at 1:00 PM (PT) if that makes you feel better.

I'm balls deep in that one too my fellow retard
Aunt Cathie smokes
Lol feel like a clown for telling that guy that he was an idiot for telling people TSLA 700 0dte was a smart play yesterday 

Then again telling people a 
 $500 straight up gamble is a smart play is an idiotic thing to do even if it pays out
Uncle put his long in your option chain?
Depends on your broker but yeah P/L on shorts is fucking confusing; I just focus on the price movement and what price I should sell or hold.

Could have realized gains at the top and would still owe, correct?
More like FOMO
PSTH baby
Clap his cheeks mods
400$ play

Thanks man, I always focus on high caps, not usually see companies with low market cap. But I'll keep an on those two! What do you think of PLTR and GME? Do you consider them way too overbought?
Nope, just the bond market.
I expect a drop below that to pick up stop losses.
Pre split bro
Same here
Had one for today and one for next week.  I gave up and sold.  Luckily that was it.
Haha ok buddy.....coming from the guy on the internet who prob still loves in his moms basement lmao

AWARDS GO BRRR
than\*
Science says yes.
I was waiting for the absolute low to hop back in on 140 calls, because I knew MMs would have to pin it above 140 to make puts expire worthless. I fell asleep and now woke up just after the jump, GUH
Not soon enough
TSLA, PLTR, NIO weeklies mostly
In regards to #3. Yes you did, severe retardation
Tsla 😤
Yes.. it's called the EOY 
  
  
**PUMP & DUMP**

*brought to you by*
Of course I do but I've also bought calls before I knew how the Greeks works. Things are slightly better when you can understand how the Greeks affect your calls.
Tired of this end of year limp dick bullshit.
Yes
Same lol. Got ten shares at 26 so as you can imagine it is doing fuck all to offset my 40 percent exposure to PLTR
Why else would he have that plane?
i truly don't get how the whole country watched NY take it in the ass for three months and learned absolutely nothing.
You probably have low Capitol to even make money, many such cases, SAD!
I thought 18 minutes ago wtf?
No acquisition not gonna happen. They have made that clear
Anyone knows why doordash stays exactly at 140 ?
If someone awards me I will post picture of my dog or chop my balls off by Friday with video proof of not
I just object, that you can plan something like amazon or apple or google in an already existing field. Will a TSLA be something like an Iphone and the rest aof all cars like Nokia and Blackberry? I dont think so. The Technology alone doesnt justify the narrative imo. And i dont think, that i am completely wrong and dumb. I get the Technology, but imo there must be something else driveng the price. Numbers, valuation and narrative would give maximum 350 bill imo right now. I just cant believe, that there isnt something else, that idont know.
Bro no way

I'm sensing a pattern here
My $21 calls hope so
That's right 2020!  End it with one last little red day bitchslap to close out!
Classic FOMO made you buy at the peak. Just hold.
Did anyone make money today? If yes what play?
Yea...shorts
It’s all gucci til you actually realize the loss
TSLA autopilot road dome.  She’s driving. Nuff said.
Narrator: this was not the bottom. He became a bottom.
Agree. They are prime target for acquisition as well. Both Amazon and Netflix would actually benefit with the IP.
nah fam, jus use L'Hopital's rule, you good
Exactly
This just made me bellty laugh, thanks bro I needed that.
Perfect chance to check the market
Investment is down 7% today. Great way to end the year...

 \*cries\*
Sure hope so. Just bought 10 more shares
I hope or I’m getting assigned 1000 shares on 1/15
Thats exactly what I did, but I still check the prices on Yahoo Finance. 

I was stupid enough to buy some share at the highs too.

I guess I never do it correctly
What is gme shares ?
GME....something happening
Honestly stonks can make you rich quickly aswell its just luck, options is gambling when no research of 8 months is done on that company
Yay here's to another day of waking up to my portfolio being slaughtered 😁😁😁
Be glad you had the losses this year and not next year
Well that failed
I thought market closed early today guess I was wrong
I yolo on pltr just a month ago.

That guy is totally lurking somewhere around here...
Trying to understand what displayed P/L means on a short call...

I’m thinking when you sell, it credits your account the premium but displays the position as negative to offset. So overall a net of 0 change to your account balance. Then as the stock moves, your P/L is how much of that premium you’ve “locked in” if you were to buy to close?
Yes. Long term hold.
Its gonna be 18 by the time I get assigned on this shit wtf how am I gonna make it back from covered calls

PLTR hanging on to that $23.5 support for dear life
Can i have a platnum
considering PLTR wedge like setup, consolidation for a month & santa rally, I "assumed" we will moon or will go sideways for a small period of time. I got calls at open & bought at every dip until close on mon. It's 90% of my port & half of my port is wiped out atm.  That's the reason for the panic. Hope we will  🚀🚀🚀
DKNG looks to be in a buy range with the recent bounce.

Holy shit wtf

I lost so much on calls with them last week and this week, and mostly because their ticker reminds me of Donkey Kong. And I love Donkey Kong. I'll try again next week maybe.

Batman forming on GME, bout to end the day at 19.00
Could have bought a Tesla and withdrawn money and then repeated
Yes, but the odds of it going beyond you break even points within a couple weeks are astronomically low. Besides, if it wen up that much Musk would dilute shares again to take advantage of it.

Nothing better than closing out this fuckclown of a year than losing $10k in the last week of trading. Only took all of December to make those gains.  

PLTR and GME gang though. And I’m not selling.

Yeah I know, I bought at 9:35 and it went up a bit, got my hopes up then tanked minutes after to a point where my contract was so low I figured fuck it if I sell now it’s a realized loss and then AAPL will start shooting up again.
Yo, we gotta stand up here.

yea idk, people were calling 30 by today. I got a pretty big position, but really don't feel too hyped about things at this point. 

1. Georgia senate recall can be bad news
2. hate all the negative press these econ majors on these investment sites write.
3. Not sure if this trades like a tech stock, or a military stock at this point. 

I ofc believe in the company since I bought at 10 and took profits...just trying to rebuild a solid position at this point.
Baba ded again?
Piece of shit QS finally tanked

But premiums on puts were so high, I still would’ve lost money lmao gay
I'm certainly not firm enough to buy puts or short it though.  It's tricky, could go up $2 next week for no reason as well.  It's just too easy to get beat up on low volume days.

WTH is going on with ARKG lately?
ABNB is just such a horrible stock above $100. It should have come out around $50 and grown into its valuation. At this valuation, it's either nothing but down from here, or flatline for the next year. Another zombie stock.
That's pretty graphic. You seem upset that your mom takes my investing advice instead of belittling me for how much buying power I happen to have at a given time on Robinhood. Maybe it's because it reminds you how she tried to raise you to be a better person and you disappointed her

It will moon after earnings. Large institutions are downgrading it left and right because they are butthurt Karp gave them the finger by doing a DPO. 

Commercial business will go thru the roof in 2021 as they are moving to an ERP style modules for Foundry so that companies don’t have to pay for the whole foundry system and instead can buy what they want. This is what Palantir wants because it’s less work for the then to get the customer up and going and then they can scale with the customer down the road. Once a company uses Palantir software, they don’t leave. 

They will talk about their R&D roadmap in the demo day and this will include the ERP style modules. Also will be pushing the Vertex portion of Foundry a lot. BP using it and saving them a ton of money. They have a create case study on that with BP and if you goto their website and see that they are looking for a sales position in Brazil that will target large Brazilian institutions. It’s safe to say they are trying to get Petrobras as a customer and chances are they will land them since They can show Petrobras how much BP is saving by using  the Foundry platform. 

On the Gotham side, they obviously can’t speak to a lot of details about that platform but they are currently creating the Battlefield software for the US army so I suspect if that goes as planned, they will sell similar versions to it to US allies. 

Just a rant but I got faith in the company. I know a lot of ppl that worked there and they accomplish what they set out to do.
It is not too late to join.

Shorts are celebrating,  Kerrisdale Capital's short announcement at the peak and Lock-up expiry on Dec 30th are doing very good favor to them.   


As of yesterday, the shortvolume is still pretty huge.

 The I.V. is at it's highest, probably, it'll go further higher like QS.

Today,  I sold a  $25 put, 19 Feb expiry for $5.40. I'm guessing, shorts will windup some positions today as long-weekend ahead.

No, but the recovery is eventual and inevitable. Investors look beyond the noise or else you’re betting against humanity.
Ohhhh yeah long calls can drive ya nuts but I bet it’ll only take 3 months for both stock to go up about 22% you’re Gucci my dude
Insane volume on B N G O
And her boyfriend please. That fucker is annoying
seriously, it's mind bending sometimes - the whole world is becoming this way - kids are being indoctrinated in public school I think is part of the problem
> As long as Jerome Powell keeps printing and keeps interest rates low we should keep going up right?

The way to look at it is "As long as Jpow keeps rates low, we shouldn't tank on Fed actions" 

There's other things that can bring us down. 

1. COVID variant causing lockdowns similar to the first ones we had in an effort to prevent our current situation from getting harder to solve

2. Diplomatic issues with China/Russia as Biden takes helm

3. Senate run off going to the dems would make a blue unified government, which will open the door to large changes in policy, specifically taxes, which the market does not like. 

4. General vol suppression laying off as EOY benchmarks are hit/missed by big firms.

I'm not mega bearish, but I'm def not blindly bullish either. The next two weeks will dictate a lot for us.
finally decided, will buy 1 ICLN leap with my $600 stimmy AFTER i get it
MODSSSS!!!
You don’t think it’ll dip again?
Too soon :(
Hell yeah brother
I’m not a bear, but I like trying to play devil advocate; 

They have 2 (?) large antimonopoly law suits against them. If either goes through, it could cut upwards of 50% of their current Rev model.  

The phones aren’t shit; iPhone 5’s are still fully functional and will continue to drive down available marketshare as an upgrade is a Quality of life purchase. 

They’re already pretty big, it’s not a fair argument at all, but what if the big boy falls? You close have millions turned into nothing if it falls and reverse plits. (Reaching at straws but we have some pretty gay bears in here) 

Microsoft fan boys run companies, Apple fan boys create products? Idk, the lawsuits are honestly the biggest bear thing I can think of rn

I actually disagree. Their business model is way too much tied to other cloud vendors (AWS, Azure, Google) making their COGS much too reliant on the big players. All of these vendors, by the way, have competing products that are multi-billion revenue stream for them. SNOW will always hit a ceiling. AWS is never shy when it comes to poaching business on price. 

They need a bigger/better story than just a basic data warehouse or they face the same fate of many wannabes vendors in this space.

Right now, I just don’t see that. This is one company I am not bullish about.
I have TSLA too, this morning I was feeling AAPL and immediately regretted that decision.
Weird. Usually their customer service is so good
First one ended up being pretty legendary though tbh

Hi I’m here to claim my free tax fraud.
I thought buying some calls the day it was down 7% would be a good strategy. I was wrong. Down 40% on my options.

Just hoping to break even at this point tbh. Buying shares as it dips and maybe will sell some covered calls if the price increases

Honestly i don't care either way. I just think it's funny the amount of hype attached to a SPAC just because of one person.. everyone be felating Ackman. We'll call it the Ackman premium. The merger will end up being an underwhelming sell the news event. This is similar to that stock bubble back in the South Sea Company days where they literally were able to grab investor money just by saying they're doing something, we don't know what, but something.. which is basically what SPAC's are the modern day equivalent of. I think they called it "an undertaking of great expectation" or something like that.
Why would there be no stimulus if the dems win runoff, it would be day one
Guh boy checking in!
I really think of this position as mostly very long term.  To be fair, I’ve held shares since the offering, leaps since the first hour they began trading.

I know people made money on the big spike up, but that kind of volatility kills anyone who jumps in because fomo.

This consolidation seems very good for an entry, shares and moderately conservative leaps seem best.  I don’t have anything expiring sooner than May
+1%, -1%, +.5%, -.5%,

Don’t lose faith, MMs trying to crush us to salvage their EOY financials. Couldn’t do it to GME, so PLTR was next best target. 

Don’t put all your eggs in calls tho, you should be long on boomer shares too. This company has already changed the world, people just don’t know it yet. 

Read the weekly updates from the PLTR guy, he had 2/19 30cs. While 35 is certainly possible, might make sense to roll a few down to a lower strike. 

TLDR: PLTR🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
What up fam! Post pandemic, we need to rally the troop for an autism awareness rally as an undercover WSB get together.
AAPL is literally pathetic.
Hopefully these GILD calls pay could use the 2021 blessing

Username checks out
TSLA is, gonna hit 750.0 today!
What's the market cap of GOEV? I'm seeing conflicting numbers. CNBC shows both 3B and 600M. Were 100M shares just added this week? Would explain the big and continued drop
Well sometimes you gotta learn the hard way I guess, really thought AAPL would be the one company to hold ATH since so many other companies had a continuation after ATH.

Im homeless but every dollar i get im buying PLantir
Yeah man the 0-days are fucking crazy. You have to be so emotionally detached and just make plays based on the chart without even really looking at your P/L

Genera Engineering is not AI building a product on its own. There’s human involvement of course, especially when it comes to esthetics. It’s assisting in coming up with the best outcome given the data. 

AI is too generic sometimes. It’s usually ML, trading models, etc. thats what Data Scientists spend all their times doing. It’s Gen 2 (at best). 

Gen 3 is when the fun begins. There a finite number of people who work on these things and they’re not on Indeed.

Time to go buy some good liquor to celebrate this weekend. Gotta have a little fun before all my calls pull a 180 and turn green.
How long is an average holding time for you?
Maybe don't ask? Just don't look at your phone for a day, later say respond and don't think twice about it. If they do give you some grief just say you were busy.

It probably seems weird because in the past you probably always text back a bunch? So it's out of character for you. If it was a normal thing then nothing would happen, so make it a normal thing
Hopefully illegal shorting instead of shorts that covered.  Would add some powder for the explosion.
Better be selling covered calls with those shares damn
Like gaining weight?
I dont understand
Oh PLTR. Please shine right like a 💎
There are a lot of investors who saw the opportunity to make money through investing in gamestop due to its current management's good balance sheet moves. They have a lot of cash (500m) and have paid off their debts through 2021, making the company worth a lot more than its evaluation back then, whether Cohen invested or not. However, information alone also can do wonders to a stock price. Cohen published a public letter well before  his increase in stake in the company, which expressed a vision for gamestop and changing its business strategies to be more with the times. Positive outlook by a wealthy CEO is enough to make people realize two things: 1) GME is probably NOT going bankrupt (that along with its good money management and pruning of GME retails stores), 2) GME has opportunities to not just remain afloat, but take its business to the next level. The short-sellers were betting GME would hit $0. Like absolutely bankrupt. This gave bullish investors incentive to push for a short-squeeze--applying pressure short sellers by pushing the stock price up. The bulk of these short-sellers are big name hedge funds, such as Melvin Capital. They can afford to not cover their shorts for a long time, but as time has passed, more and more bullish details have come out, and right now they are basically screwed. They will eventually have to cover their positions and lose lots of money--the covered shorts will push GME even further up, possible resulting in a squeeze, possibly resulting in a steady but rapid climb just like TSLA's climb this year. Additionally, GME is undervalued by about 300% related to its earnings and cash flow. Multiple websites have remarked at this already, setting a price target of about $40-$50. This price target does not consider Cohen's involvement, nor the short-squeeze.
I sold 50 shares for a loss at 395
Up 4 dollars today as of now

They don’t need to pay a dividend when they’re still growing. Same with Google.
716% gain. Straight stonks 
830 shares nio @ 6.37
179 shares pltr @ 16.78
Still holding

Around 37,000 in gains
This is the second best post to get an award in this sub today
When did you buy these?
Or that they said they might never make a profit
So slow....
Sounds like socialism to me. I reject your reality and subsitotite my own truth
You should sell - I need all of you to sell and stop believing then it will go up.
Lot of incorrect assumptions - maybe stop using trading view iono?

* Yes squeezes are hard to come by, and having a squeeze even on GME will take a sharp change in either the supply or demand curve. You don't know what the true float is.
* The true float is not 60 m shares. You have to subtract insider shares (RC has 12.9% for example) and some longs are not lending their shares - you don't really know.
* Float is synthetically increased when the stock is highly shorted
* A proxy is the bid ask spread as someone mentioned. It should normally be within 1 cent for a stock like GameStop.  You'll see sometimes when the spread is almost 10 cents, this is relative to the risk the MM takes on and is also a proxy for liquidity.
* True liquidity is a moving target all the time - that's why you'll see the bid ask spread  larger closer to opening and closing bell when more shares are changing hands vs in the middle of the trading day.
Wheres the 100k palantir leaps guy ?

English bro
"VIX has nothing to do with dumping" is a terrible take. I already said it doesn't necessarily 1:1 always 100% correlate with dumping, but it does suggest volatility and dumping is more likely. Simply look at charts of the SP500 and VIX and teach yourself about this correlation.

To respond to that with "ah but see look, I found an example where Spy closed down 0.75% while VIX was flat, therefore VIX is uncorrelated with dumping" is just trolling or stupidity.
PRAISE THE LORD 💎🚀
You losers believe in GME yet or what? Get on board to $30
Praying power hour sees some movement, idc which way just give me some volume 🙏🙏🙏
Buy the THBR dip, going to run in January for sure.
Now you understand why it’s worthless

Omg look at all the awards. HAH!

Special dividend for special investors
Good idea, so calls? Or just stock outright?
With a small account and high risk 25% a month if not its not worth it.
Prob cuz it’s normal to see tsla in your portfolio be this green all the time :)

Would have doubled my god damn investment

2020 has skewed what is normal big time
Nice 14 hundred shares, boomer. How much will you charge for 14 FDs?
Meh appl earnings same week, but PLTR does seem at low, but it’s also just a company making money off contracts where’s the product flow and daily buys why do people care about something that doesn’t have consistent sales?
It's technically a warrant which is basically the same thing on IBKR
spy straight up just not really moving this week
They're just letting the price dip so it can have momentum for the moon shot. I have various 8/21 calls for 25 - 40. They're still very very cheap.

It’s already bottomed out I want an eod pump
Are you saying my mom's not a whore?
Exactly! You can't time the bottom. 


Monday will decide our dip buying fate.
yea, the major problem I see is if dems win Georgia recall, senate turns blue suddenly, military budget cuts happen, pltr contract acquisitions decrease....do you think that's an actual problem?
She came out with some new content like a few months back, still a baddy to
Not surprised but thats also why I bought shares. Why play the MMs game and get your calls fucked over like this retard. Even if it hits 30 unless it swings drastically he isn't breaking even bc theta and iv crush
Yessir. Probably EOD
Something something tendies 
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
what stocks to add to the long term td?
hitting 7% monthly on Theta seems unsustainable. Most safe theta plays probably net 1% a week

Lol, opened up my stock tracker, saw everything was red (after finally going full  bull), went fuck this year.

Got a little excited because I remembered I got one tiny TSLA put end of day yesterday, scrolled to the bottom of my tracker, and it's 3% green.

Seriously, fuck this year.
Been looking to make a play all day but nothing looks good
Screw all these meme stocks I’m going back to the one that brought me to an ATH... NIO 🚀🚀🚀
Because like 80% of other stocks that recently hit ATH kept running, shitty companies too. I figured AAPL had a shot at actually maintain ATH at least for a day or two but people are fucking pussies
Loooool
when did it expire? lol
Glad I bought shares
Dude. FUBO has fucked me hard in the ass
I have call options till end of Feb and end of May.

Better read up before you do that
Just hoping to stick the landing.
I haven’t looked at my PLTR calls in like a week now. I have to imagine they’re completely dead cuz they expire in 2 weeks but I cant tell if its worth it to cut my losses or to just hold

This is the opposite of socialism. Instead of the government taking your money to give hospital beds to obese people with covid or to give free shit out, you get to choose where it goes. And you get a tax credit for it! You just pay a premium to choose where some of your taxes go

How much do actual active trading autists make in regular times? I know we’re in a crazy good market right now but it seems like even in relatively stagnant conditions, you could still make pretty good money on theta-centric strategies. The idea that 7-9% is average per year just seems ridiculous. If I’m not hitting that on a monthly basis I feel like I’m not doing that well
Most companies have an "investor relations" link on their website, which is typically where you direct such questions.
Markets close at 4, bond market at 2
but months only goes to 12
Most of the time, but they tend to diverge especially at the end of each month when firms do portfolio rebalancing. Same thing happened Nov 30th
No

You’re so far into the meme you’re okay with losing money. Ta ta there retard.
AAPL is a good long and I have it but comparing it to TSLA is ridiculous. TSLA was on the brink of bankruptcy ~18 months ago, AAPL has been a top company for over a decade. I wouldn't be surprised with another 20-40% year but expecting 3x bagger here is dumb.

Tesla short sellers lost $38B in 2020
Oh good I bought more stuff!!!!
Ohh shit okay ✅
Looks like it went down to fill the gap at $86.49 from the 7th. There are some gaps lower down though but don't necessarily have to be filled.

Looking at his past comments, he was cash gang until 'EOD.' He's probably fuk like the rest of us now if he didn't know 🤡🤡🤡
Stop thinking tesla is car company you dumb fucks
Congrats!!!
I’ve heard that smart people with degrees are just as shit with trading as everyone else
Up 36% overall at 38k made. I made a big TVIX bet way too early in the fall of 2019...I was bleeding into 2020 and felt like a moron... then made 10k in profit in an instant when the market crashed. I pulled out when TVIX was around 400 and put that into SHOP, DIS, AAPL, MSFT stocks (which were are all way down). TVIX kept flying to 1k but it would have been impossible to time. As we all know those big stocks recovered so i doubled that 10k from the VIX play, plus the rest of my holdings came back + some. I pulled out 20k to put a down payment on a house yesterday.

Prolly a good time to buy pltr rn.
I need a dip to buy I’m getting withdrawals
Elevator up eod
The bottom line is that while pltr is the future they are not very profitable at the moment and thus far haven't really attracted institutions to invest in it.
F u jackasses.....when Tesla was dumping under 350 everyone said it’s going to 100.......idiots
Wow, I think this warrants the Yolo flair. Keep us updated, maybe you’ll hit $6 soon 👍🏼
It sort of did.  It's still up over 30% in the past 6 weeks even with the dip this week.

Not retarded question: If i'm an investor in a company or want to invest in a company and want to ask that company a question, what is the appropriate way to do so?

Specifically:
I'm invested in a nanocap and one of the founders lists a patent belonging to him and a co inventor in his linkedin profile, but when i search for the patent nothing comes up. I want to ask them what the deal is with that because i imagibe it's basically their moat protecting them agaist amazon,google, microsoft etc

I can’t see it hitting $220 even with the price target moved down from $325 to $285 it’s a great buy.
no need to take my word for it, do your own dd, I merely provided the ticker + sentiment

p.s. hold until +20% on stonk, around $75/share, then sell and rebuy at $69 and repeat ad inifinitum

p.s.s. it's up ~2% since we started yapping

You should stop doing that.  When you make a good size win, rather than letting it ride, invest it in something not dumb, like AMZN or MSFT shares or something that isn’t going to go to 0.  Hell, buy shares of TQQQ.  Continuously rolling wins in to a new long OTM options position is a way to definitely go broke sooner or later.  Change your strategy bro.  
Whatever you did to make 100k from 2k, do that with no more than 30% of your portfolio.  Take the other 70% and put it somewhere safer, and add to that 70% every time you win an options play.

The sell offs started literally the moment the AAPL events started. Massive pump leading up, massive dump right at the start of the event. Sometimes there’s a bit of recovery afterwards, but likely the profitable play would be to load up on calls the day before and sell before the event.

All these ding dongs bitching about PLTR killing them this week. No one said options on these over all.... shares were the play IMO and Long for PLTR...
91k gain ( ~250% gain)
Started with 36k in Tesla and held from June to September. Lost 50k (50% of my account ) in September from buying calls on tech and FAANG stonks. 

I then yolo into PLTR gang and Tesla options with 1 week till exp. and regain my 50k in one day and get a 90 day ban from trading. 

After being banned, I chat with tasty works support team and make a second, only cash, account and move my money over there. 

I yolo into SNOW puts and am still holding those.  Omw to Valhalla now! All of this happened in my first year of college too. Damn this was a very stressful year.

You are a fucking complete retard. Godspeed
what does that imply for stonks again? bearish?
Yea Bc you’re not in the winners circle. Dm me
I'm no scientist but I think it would be illegal to sell options that don't make everyone money. I mean its not like you can lose money on calls. If the nice man in my computer says PLTR  $500 1/31 , I don't think he would lie. I mean who would do that sell options they didn't think would help out the every man.

10x in 5 years IS slow, long term growth for this sub.

You have people betting their house, their mama's house, and their dumpster-view graveyard plot on calls a month away. I love a  🏳️‍🌈🐻 as much as the next guy, because their hairy arms and tender words make me feel safe. But there's a difference between Boomer-esque wisdom that gives us a 2.5% gain by the time we're 60 and the autism-fuelled time dilation that people get into here. 

PLTR will pay out shockingly quick for a weird data-focused shady stock that's been on the market for 4 months (and it already has for people who went in big at IPO and cashed out seeing 2x-3x gains), but it won't pay out quick enough for our lovely gambling addicts and casino fetishists.

I think PLTR at $50 by the summer is extremely likely, and double that by 2022. But half this sub will be dead from Fetal Alcohol Syndrome by that point anyway!
You learning, does this mean pizza hut calls?
Nah, I have my positions. Just not in bubble stocks like GeNoMiC rEvOlUtIoN.

Up 40% YTD.  Was down about 15% at one point.  Started actively trading last December.  Biggest gains coming from SPACs and clean energy plays.  Holding shares has been the most lucrative, but have had some big gains on options but I've also seen plenty of -99%.  Learned the options fallacy of 💎 ✋ and started cashing out big gains and letting runners run.  It's been a fun year of ups and downs and I've learned a lot!
90 eod easy
Who in the actual fuck gave this a ternion?!
Went gay on FUBO, I feel dirty but satisfied
i’m new to trading, what does it mean by a red candle?
*sees NFLX JAN 2022 $780 calls spike from $0.01 to $0.76 each*

Man, that looks like a pretty sweet deal if you got in early.

*sees the open interest is 0*

*notices it's not JAN 2022, but JAN 2021*

Nevermind, it's just algos playing theta gang.
Man thank you. Makes me feel like at least my loosing moves weren’t that stupid this week
how do you fucks come up with this shit man
SELL OFF SHAKEOUT TO BEGIN 2021 - MOON MISSION FROM MARCH ONWARDS
No because they don’t want to legalize marijuana anyway and only decriminalize.
Seems like we're late to this boat, or every investor and their mother just had this thought occur to them today
I think inflation would outpace his gains.  not to mention he has to pay tax on the dividends.  He could earn more begging for change on the corner.

Bro if your stressing then go heavy on the eddies you gonna have a bad time.  Good vibes only.
I can tell you what I'm eyeballing next. Several stocks have had big run ups this year and we're seeing huge drop offs from profit taking. Thing is, they'll probably reach a new ath again in the next few months and they're entering bargain territory. TTD is an obvious one to grab when it finds its floor, EXPI is another one.
You're right should have taken out more

Pltr is going to 19. Tesla calls are for frat bois livin w mommy in Omaha. Xpev is the only good bet rn. Gonna go to 48. Back down to 39 then hold pattern till 2/1 then up to 75 between 2/1 & 7/1. Watch 👀
oooo you better put that shit on ice money..........
We're all in a simulation
Ok mr smarty computer science accent man, can you explain to me something? 

hypothetically speaking... I run a small or large business (I ask in case there are different answers for each) and I hear artificial intelligence will save me or make me lots of money. Let’s say I sell clothing via e-commerce, How can I use or what would palantirs software do to make my life easier? I saw the video of LAPD using Gotham and it looked like a google search. Let’s say I’m this private small business, and I don’t know what to ask?
The amount of FOMO from missing out on the March crash is so embarrassing in this sub, people don’t realize there has to be a catalyst to drop like that or else we will continue to go up like we’ve been doing since the chaotic election

'**LEAPS**' - I love you WSB, stay frosty.
Doyle Brunson made the same point I’m about to make in his Super System book- 

Whenever you make $50,000, no one ever asks why you didn’t quit when you were up $25,000. 

Hindsight is always 20:20.  If he kept winning up to $250,000 before losing, you would be telling us all how you’d have taken $248,000 and banked it. 

Picking the exact moment when you stop winning and start losing is impossible.  That’s why you should diversify and make it impossible to lose 98% of your portfolio.
Buying calls with an expiration date in the past? Is this a new strategy🧐?
Oh Google has a better AI team than PLTR? Of course it does, they’re one of the most powerful companies on Earth. 

So you’re saying Google could overtake PLTR’s business? Sure, maybe a fraction IF they wanted to, but they wouldn’t, because they don’t do the same shit. Amazon could start making cell phones and sneakers, but why would they? Don’t just bring up random shit and throw out predictions about AAPL’s future valuation.

$72 currently.
Up about 30% YTD, from $81k to $106k.

This is my first year of trading stocks and options frequently, and I started in March, so I was way too cautions about there being a second crash. Kind of wish I was a more seasoned investor so I could see the opportunity of that crash, but if I was, I'd probably have lost a lot in the crash, so idk.
I also rarely had more than 40-50% of my account in the market, so if I was just more confident in my plays, I probably could've had +55-60% on the year.

My strategy has been pretty safe. Lots of short-term swing trades of shares, cash-secured puts, and spreads. I know that's weak shit for this sub, but have a decent job and I think I'm on track to be fairly wealthy even if I average +10% a year on the market, so I don't quite have that "get rich or go broke" mentality a lot of you guys have, so it's super rare I dump even $1000 on OTM calls.

My biggest short term score was the first week of June, where I pulled in about $5k on MGM/RRR shares and MGM calls in a week, on some half-assed DD that "casinos are reopening, their stonks will go up." Basically got lucky that the whole market had a nice spike at the time.

I have no idea what I want to do in the next year. The market is either getting a hard correction in the next few months or it's just gonna keep cruising upwards. For now I'm sitting on XRX, MSFT, and SWTSX, as well as some microcap investments, and chipping in about $2k a week on ICLN and SPWR to get some cash on Joe Buyden rising to power. The most important thing is going to be timing the peak and getting the fuck out if/when the market tanks, which I think could definitely happen once all these people default on mortgages and get evicted and all that as a result of the unemployment and businesses going bankrupt.

GME, they are doing an event late jan and a bunch of underwater puts are due around that time. At least 30 around april.

Neither is slated to lose and they need to lose both. One of them has 90% chance and every pollster underestimates REPs by nearly 5% as 2020 indicated.
Well AAPL you had a pathetic effort at holding ATH, clearly nobody wants you anymore, I think it may be time to move on for a while

Why would you sell?  You still had time on the calls but now there’s no chance of recouping any losses and you only get $500....
If your portfolio is under 20% loss today that is a win

Hey guys, because the markets are closed for us in Europe since yesterday midday I sold my TSLA calls yesterday... can I get an F from my fellow Tesleronis! I‘m happy for you! Into a strong 2021! 🚀
Show proof or ban
Let’s fucking go. I need to get out of this gay ass April 45c
🐝 with that EOD erection
pandemic is an old news. Ryan has been only tweeting about GME why would he talk about pandemic all of sudden??
Because you are 16 1/2 years old, so your entire idea of what a woman is is in accurate
I bought the dip and it dipped harder 😂
They’ll miss him when it’s like today for the next four years lol
The stock price is just a game to these guys lol. Number go up 🐒 happy. Market cap, float, etc are too complicated.
Google my handle and Mongo. Used to be tight in the MongoDB world. We’ve completely moved away from it and nobody in the enterprise space trusts them. They’re a tank in 2021 regardless of the market. 

My sentiment overall though is that SaaS has a big drop. Maybe not sitcom crash, but big drop is coming. Privatized clustering and self managed services are spiking in popularity and not just from hype.
It's slows down your stupid decisions. it's a feature.

so the ARK options are just gonna chill in decimals now?
Thats retarded.... but its WSB mate! Good luck

7 year low and has a P/E of 9. Will probably get bought or merge
What’s tsla closing at?
Hahaha, you should hold UVXY once....
Dude terrible strike price sell now
Oh that's good to hear. Also I can't believe someone not only saw my comment this fast, but also awarded it. This is insane and awesome and could go down in reddit history
To be fair, if you’d sold before and rebought after, you’d’ve made more
Gotcha. I'd like to do the same, so maybe I'll slowly cash out of my positions if/when they're positive if they currently aren't and migrate into cash and start writing spreads for my current cash amount. I kinda like that.

Thanks again.

I went Jan-22 $1300s

Market should drill to say farewell fuck you to 2020
yeah but making a modern day movie with the black guy = black ranger and asian chick = yellow ranger is just opening things up to unnecessary bs.
Go play with your crayons retard.
Nah I bought 2023 LEAPS when shares were at 15 so I’m chilling but short term doesn’t look too good with lockup expiring unless demo day can pump it up
Hilarious. Hilarious that a SPAC is valued at such a premium before anything even happens.. I'm gonna laugh my ass off if they say "we're merging with SHLDQ" and the shit drills.
[deleted]
Post deleted so looks like it
No one knows for sure when it'll happen, which is why the play is stocks instead of options.
I did an analysis on this
A CC in this case is actually more safe than just owning the shares on margin.

Stay away from options until you learn a bit more. ;)
Bruh moment
No it's not Michael
Miss Donald pumps market where shit went up 15% in a day for no reason
PLTR, ARKG
Both of these are good regrets
Or..you know the pandemic? Maybe if you retards buy 10 more GME rewards memberships the price will shoot up $10. If you get 20 reddit awards it shoots up another $15
thanks! this retard right here is gonna pass this right on to the OP!
HAHAHAHAHAH YOOOOOO WHAT THE FUUUCK
It's free money for the person who wrote the put

How dare you want to have anytime for yourself after working 40+ hours a week
Thats a nice new year present 🎁
What I meant was, that other humans can also have other Ideas that Tesla doesnt have. Others can use AI, too. I just dont think, that TSLAs plan to rule all industrial production in the world because their AI, is not gonna happen. If so, there would be no other profitable industry company in the world. I also already work with AI. Its very powerful, but it will never be able to replace certain human skills. If you mess up a little bit, even the best AI wont help you. and no one is perfect, even not TSLA.
Okay thank you sir i gucked myself. 
Went from $3k to $35k in November and i am back down to 10k now sadd boi

Bruh you can have mine. I don’t want em anymore
For a couple hours
I've been holding since 10s. Never took profits. Gave some back with bad call plays. For now im just hedging and waiting for it to gain some real traction.  Once we get past the lockup period I think we'll see a slow and steady rise in price. IMO its 55 plus by end of next year
Yea but not now 🤡🤡🤡 and that guy i know is probably gonna double down

The amount of dividends is calculated into the price of puts and calls to avoid a free lunch. 

If a stock was 50 bucks, and was going to give out a 1 dollar dividend, it will ex div at 49 bucks.

If the put and call were both 2 dollars for just after ex div expiration, you could buy the put the day before and sell it the day after and make basically free money. Or you could sell the call and make free money. 

But the price of the put is higher by the dividend, and the price of the call is lower by the dividend, so you really can't do this. But that also contributes to puts being priced higher over longer time frames.

Should nab me ROTY honors here but if that doesn’t - PLTR & GME gang🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Aside from all their contracts with huge players, they have an efficient system or operation of business that lets them immediately get to work on solving a client’s issues. If you look at similar companies, they may be able to fo a fraction of what PLTR does, but PLTR is able to look into a client’s data and actually SEE things, aside from just organizing it like a lot of its competitors do.
Perfect end to a perfect year
Will weed stocks pop if Georgia goes blue next week?
It hurts how if anyone had $200 when I first recommended going long gold they have thousands in gains from that now but since I only had $25 and opened a shitty call debit spread I only made $5 in gains

To be fair I could have taken more risk with a shorter expiry call on IAU instead of the spread on GLD so I did have another option but I can't imagine how easy it would be to make money with $1000+ where you can be risk averse and take the long expiry on the bigger ticker AND have unlimited upside

Also my fault though because I would have picked the FD over the spread if I hadn't forgotten during my hiatus how spreads not only limit your top but also make your gains slow as fuck until expiry

I need to not be a bussy and just jump in + sell CCs on the rips

It's FROG btw, imo. Got killed lately, secular bull trend, and ready for a no reason pump in January / Feb.
I know someone who opened his short positions on TSLA at $600 🤡🤡🤡
I lost 3,300 on PLTR calls at peak as well. (33% of my account)

Lol is TSLA running up more?
I respect the 'tism of someone willing to buy puts in the biggest meme spac of all time.
Around 5000 dollars wasted in awards already for this post and comment thread that could be used to pump GME
Consider HIMX. I’m in with 5,000 shares and 100 03/19/2021 $7 calls. Bought in at $6.70 and expect it to hit $13.

But wait, thats not the nuts part. HIS PORTFOLIO IS DOWN 104K TO 95K. Like people say we are the retards. Lost 7k in wealth on the year when we have such a huge bull market. Hes even diversified with 25 different stocks.

It’s all the secret shit.  Of course.  If you knew about it it wouldn’t be secret and it won’t be worth as much right?  I’m surprised I have to explain this to you.
What kind of LEAPS can you buy with 10K?  1500s-2000s?
Ah refreshing to see your outlook of net -50% as a gain. Keep up the good spirits ✊
It feels good to be around as madlads do. Ladies and gentlemen, welcome 2021.

OP, what would you recommend doing with warrants? Currently hold some with a \~30% unrealized loss.
Or Apple is in partnership with NIO to build cars and Buffet is putting in a 25% stake in NIO.

That’s the thing...there aren’t intelligent humans who can disrupt anything. It’s AI being fed data from sensors on millions of cars. That AI is used to enhance the product in an exponential way. Generative Engineering. 

You’re thinking about how cars are made by the others. Diess figured this out. You can’t catch up with just clever engineering. Tesla has a 3 year lead (minimum). If somebody were to start now, it will take them years just to setup the infrastructure. By then, Tesla has moved so far out catching up is more difficult. Manufacturers will literally have to change the way they build cars. You can’t just slap on sensors and cameras     

Tesla employed AI (digital twin, etc) since day 1. It started in 2003. 

What Tesla is doing is changing how products (not just cars) are being built. It’s proven Industry 4.0 works and can crush the competition. Again, look at Bezos move. He doesn’t want to be just the cloud guy. That’s so 2010.

I normally don’t hop back in plays after I exit, but the PLTR dip is looking juicy. Was in at $12, out at $29 and said I wasn’t going back in. But this is looking like a nice buy. $22 hits and I’m back in I think.

analysis dweeb? I.R low, stonks backed by prinner, and economy is getting better....

N.m almost forgot their is a loser to everyone of my bigly wins, keep buying puts.
PLTR is #1 in the game, and to put them down as a consulting firm is stupid. You can’t compare PLTR to any of its “competitors” because no one has the capability to do what PLTR has only just started succeeding in. Who cares if they’ve yet to turn a profit, they put $$$ in R&D to put themselves ahead of the game. Give it a few years and PLTR will be gobbling up the entire market share.
Same way I did the first part, just picked wrong the second time.

45's still huge premium and so little delta. I still expect massive volatility in the new year, borrow rate on FUBO and QS is insane right now. We'll see some nice squeezes yet. Might pay off to have long bias at these levels already.

From early on, google was a company by nerds for nerds. As it grew, google realized they cannot build a company just with nerds, so they brought on many humanities majors for people management roles like "inclusivity manager", "community engagement manager", "culture manager" and these people brought their political baggage with them into the company.

Now the company is a political wokeness battlefield, where instead of focusing on building cutting-edge technology, there is an internal battle between teams on whether AI they are building has a racial bias, how to make AI more inclusive etc. While all that is great, it is making the company lose its focus on developing good technology. All the phenomenal tech talent that they have are being squandered under incompetent/woke management.
explain this to me: 6 months ago GME was 5$ a share, Cohen bought in at 15.
She was replaced before that though.

People have to have real belief in the tech/company for it to break 30 and more. The PR has been non existent.

Up 16% for the year on Betterment, 17% on my 401k, and -8% on my RH. Gotta just start letting the robots take care of my money instead of buying options 🤡

Edit: just bought more PLTR
SQ fucked me
hey mod can I get a flair? I want something awesome
Good question, We haven't used Tableau except for very basic visualizations, and I am not directly involved (I'm fairly useless at UX).  


They claim to be able to find patterns across multiple data sources. It sounds like you can point it at a set of SQL tables and a log dump and it will create a layer which tries to find common data across both. Definitely sounds like your mileage would vary greatly based upon how similar and consistent the data sets are.  


I'm definitely not a big data guy, so I can't say for sure.  


My hunch is that they haven't faced much competition in the government/defense space but they will find it harder to dominate in the Fortune 1000 space, unless their proprietary AI actually is as revolutionary as the pumpers claim.
Expiration and Strike?
GL, I'm waiting for sub $18 to re-enter. I also bought some SPY 372 calls this morning. Can you help me out Mr CEO?
Fuck blew up my account again playing NIO dailies
The old saying is “short sleeves to short sleeves in three generations,” but you managed to do that in 12 months. Expensive lesson, again, from what it sounds.
sold about 80 puts this week. currently under about 10k... trying to build up a decent long term hold position
Ah then that confirms it, you are indeed retarded 👨‍⚕️
It's fucking sickening.
That’s because they allow video memes here
Markets wild can’t even short a worthless company like GameStop after it leaps 70 percent in a week who tf keeping that up bro

Lil Yachty mixtape was delayed from Dec to sometime in Jan so no way there's an EOY dump. MM's could be taking profits in the coming weeks ahead of the release of the mixtape "Michigan Boat Boy" originally scheduled to be released in late 2020 but confirmed to be delayed by Yachty until January on his Twitch stream.

I like QC as an intro and quick way to do models and back tests so I like it overall. I have the skills to build and access to data through TDA, it’s just finding the time to build my own since I’m too cheap to pay for it especially since I won’t be going immediately live. Probably just not doing it right but I don’t think I’ll ever be able to build the kind of model on QC that I would ever want to go live with.

“In my previous column on Palantir, published on Dec. 11, I warned that the company could very well face tough competition going forward. In preparation for today’s article, I searched for one or more competitive advantages that could set Palantir above other data-analysis and consulting firms.

Unfortunately for the owners of the stock, after looking through the company’s website and the transcript of its third-quarter earnings conference call, I wasn’t able to find any compelling competitive advantage that the company has.”

It’s not about what it is, it’s about what it could be. GME has already has the infrastructure the pivot into a much more profitable business structure, especially if you see their stores as distribution centers instead of physical store fronts

If you are looking to hold and collect the dividends, yes.  T is a better value imo.  I still have to hold some VZ til March to reach long term though, so not selling.  I don't think it will drop much, certainly not 20%, by then.
if pltr closes above $26 today ill jizz my face

They put a green screen in the mines of Moria? What a shitty way to ruin a historic site
What time does the market close today?
PLTR is a legit company but the mix of MM’s suppressing the price for them not IPOing and it being popular on WSB is not good short term
at least you're only down 1k all time...ri-ri-right?
So if I’m banned for 90 days from a broker can I just switch brokers and not be restricted?

You’re also clearly not aware of the rumors and patents on VR hardware, a VR OS, Car, and other innovations in R&D. Apple does one thing REALLY WELL: market timing.

Because they all dipped recently and once the new guy gets sworn in all green energy companies will start to get more gov incentives to operate.

UPDATE BABY LOSS PORN TIME !!!!
I have no idea what this fancy picture you posted means, but holding a bunch of shares and selling weekly calls when it rockets upwards for an hour have worked pretty well for me.
Fuck yeah!
I just started playing with the market this November when I turned 18. I had a little bit of money left over from working this summer so I put $1900 of it into a Webull account. I’m up around 65% since I started which is better than I thought I’d do with no experience. Even though my portfolio is super small I’m glad I’m getting some experience for when I’m older and have more money to throw into things.
jesus christ next person to ask what time the market closes, i hope you slip on bear shit and fall off a cliff

No no I'm not trolling they have things going on but the history of $NOK isn't necessarily a gold train.   They have small gains.  They have things going on with 6G initiatives, 5G is still a thing. I wouldn't expect much for a few years while they are trying to improve themselves on debt. If they get bought out it's gonna be big play but they do have good things they are working on.  Space travel is a thing putting people on the moon 2024-26   possible lunar base outfit somewhere in terms of 2040-45. If we didn't have to fight with gravity every time we went up into space we would further exploration by humans.  I think papa musk's starlink will be biggest contribution. He is literally looking to the Future of innovation.
This shit is so true. The first time I put significant money in several calls was the wknd before biden was announced president. That Monday my calls skyrocketed. Phew. Been slowly losing money since. Luckily I banked the majority of my gains.

How come? Let's say that I'm "fully invested" and don't really want to use more margin at these price levels. I might still be willing to sell QQQ (or other ETF) puts and use more margin if prices fall a bit and then sell covered calls on those to reduce margin usage over time.
how convenient
Feeling extra 🌈 today 🐻?
I wouldn’t be able to sleep either if I betted against Tesla
It's almost like everyone here is retarded
Or just young...
Agreed. Bear in mind as well, alot of pussies from r/stocks and r/investing have come here recently and so alot of them are the ones saying to take all profits quickly.
I can’t keep buying ever pltr dip lmao this is so sad

PLTR is not even a meme stock. This company is legit and is the next Tesla
Thanks to everyone who bought puts on PSTH this year.  I promise to take much better care of your money than you did.
it would give us a larger stimmy and less reason to realize capital gains and sell stocks?
Yeah true.. i might just think these returns are normal in an "active trader" community/environment. But i mean, 16% on S&P is pretty damn spectacular.. isn't the all time record only 18%?

Not always, make sure you look at the test first. Had a high school teacher that let us drop our lowest test score out of 4 tests at the end of the school year. I already had a 95% from the first 3 tests and asked to opt out of the 4th, he said no. So without even looking at the test I just marked C on every answer to see what I'd get. At least a third of the test was True/False questions...think I got a 13% or something on the test. Teacher and I both got a good laugh.

Most likely would be BABA. China is higly invested in Africa as part of their silk road initiative. They're dumping tons of money into building African Infrastructure. I work with a guy from Africa and he says every time he goes back there it is crazy how fast it is growing. Also Africa is forecasted to have the fastest growing population & economy in the coming years. I doubt Amazon would buy them because it might be a PR nightmare if the richest person in the world(also a white man) was taking over Africa.

Damn. No roasting here. Sorry for your loss
Yes, but still not convincing for 600 billions. They may have the best and cheapest car, but will never have a monopoly. You cant cut production costs and make it that much better, that it justifies that price. There is also many other very intelligent humans on earth who will also have good ideas to dirrupt that. I mean, i understand a high valuation, but such a rise in such a time buy such an absolute amount has to have other reasons. Maybe Elon is asking Oracle for financial advice, because he messed something up. Maybe he did something not completely legal which has gotten a little out of control.
I wonder how many more chromosomes my body can handle before I’m Stephen hawking of losing money

NET still hasn’t broken its support right?
Not a great day for my bitchcoinz stock
The fact that this is a normal distribution return this year says something about market conditions.. if everyone made at least a 50% return this year throwing darts at meme stocks, what does that say?
I'll translate this for the bears. Run bitch Ruuuuuun

I could've bought baba at 217 but I overslept and bought at 233, if it remains steady during investigation then it should rocket after yearly earnings report
I hope so

Why are people such pussies with AAPL? Seriously the toilet paper fucking pussy ass selling on every uptick is ridiculous.
Cardboard
I think its the future regardless so holding as a long term investment
Hold it and reevaluate end of next week.
How much does that actually get back?
Tesla plug anymore...
The year is 2077, PLTR is still around the $23-$24 mark. PLTR bulls are still screaming 💎👐.

Hello,

Please may I have your kind help to understand how the Sell Covered Calls works and how can I avoid losing money?

\- I own 1.100 shares at $31.

\- Currently, the stock is trading at $24. 

\- I think it will decrease to $20 by February 2021.

\- I do not think it will surpass $31 by Feb 2021.

I want to sell covered calls to expiry in February. 

If I sell 5 orders at $20 Strike with premium $1.18 expiring 5 February. 

1) Will I earn 590$ if I am exercised? (100 x 5) x 1.18 = $590

2) What if the stock stays $22 and has not attained the $20 strike? Will I loose money?

3) Did I miss anything ?
Can I get a reward please?

How much dick do I need to suck to make PLTR go brrr again
Tbh not really focusing on delta, just something decently OTM that can get me around $100 per spread. 

Yes to the dump $40k thing, in that case it'd be 80 spreads.

There have been points where I use the credit from the initial spreads to open even more spreads, but depends on how things are lookin
Spending the first 5 hours of 2021 trading 🙃

My guess is: CNBC pumped it yesterday + people want to be in it before Q1 begins because LOI could come anytime in Q1 + volume spike at 11am is possible whale buy

[deleted]
From 2 to 100k I'm sure you can do 1 to 50k no prob
What price?
The long call at 11 is gonna make more because the delta is higher, however premiums to buy will be more expensive for the 11 strike, so even tho you make more $$, the % return may be less than the 15c would be
Kate Rooney or Morgan Brennan FTW

I bought some high, some low. So I’m a litte red right now. I could have kept selling weekly calls but didn’t want to miss out on the mooning that everyone here promised.
Can you elaborate on point 3? What news sources do you use and could you please provide an example of a play that you made this year?

-53% on the year boys. Never had this much fun losing all my money. 

Just bought some PLTR 27 & 30 calls expiring in Feb. Sorry in advance for when it drops to $19 and trades flat till March when it moons to $100
You can not be serious with this SPY bullshit. Just close the market already. Fucking just gonna stay flat all day.
MMs wanted to wipe out FDs. Or am I being paranoid
Wow
Just look at the delta
About to summon king PAIMON to see wtf is going on.

No, you are not a bagholder. You are brave soul who have put down a 10% deposit to be a part of a great endeavour, you are now a member of GME gang. It is not just a group, it is a movement, to overthrow the filthy, manipulating shorters, for distribution of wealth and tendies to those who deserve them (ie us).

Welcome aboard, soldier. I am sure the deposit will be returned with significant additional interest.

This is why people run the wheel. I've made so damn much swing-trading TSLA these past few months. I'm not selling another put till it drops below 680 though. Their price right now is even more retarded than normal

I did a buy-write for 100 shares for 1.25 for the 15th. Quick 12% in two weeks if it doesn't shit the bed before then. I just usually never do this on stocks I don't follow
The news literally acting bearish to scare people into selling so they won’t lose their positions at the start of January, y’all are retards for selling anything. Watch them change their tune immediately next week after they buy back in

i hope they lose more next year

At least you got the DiVIdeNd.
Quick question, say a stock is at $10 and if you buy a long call at $11 and one at $15 which one would be more profitable if the stock goes up?
Going to drop into the new year with a perfect buy the dip opportunity. What gifts they bring.
I’m not mad I’m just disappointed
Assuming PLTR has some upswing coming up. Been predictable up until now
Pltr is down again. Idk if I have the hands to hold anymore. What do i do boys?
Extraordinary.

I did it boys, I finally got my account to break even lol
Like long term? Alot of stuff. Or do you mean 0dte calls
It’s called Down syndrome.
So focus on AMZN AAPL next week, didn't know AMD down today until now.
I think it's going to test $14 again before rising into the next quarter.
Why? Why should we fear to use it?
That’s because they don’t understand them. But neither does anyone here, they just know not to touch them.

It's weird to root against a particular stock you don't own or want to own. Unless it is a scam like NKLA, why do you care if PLTR is making people money? It's just rude in my opinion. PLTR isn't out there destroying whatever ticker you are rooting for.
Are you still in CRSR?
very bad shape on my PLTR holdings. I'm not sure I can exit anytime soon with a profit and wholly unsure of what the next month will look like. I'll probably purchase some weekly calls on these dips and claw back out on the upswings.

Best thing you can do right now if you’re not buying dips is just turn your phone off for the day and come back Monday

So what could save PLTR at this point?
yeah man. still holding my leaps. Didn't print as much as I wanted. I still think long term we'll be fine.
I’ve been waiting for a blastoff since getting in at $48 a share years ago. It finally happened this year and I’m ready for more!
DKNG has been getting flayed alive this week, down 10%+ - what's going on? Almost want to buy $48c for next Friday.

Haha guh indeed my friend and yes nio is a long shot I think it’s a paper hands sorta play.  S ion as I see profits I run and never look back. Cause it’s definitely a funky stock but right now I’m up 400 on the calls and I have 106 in total so if it gets pumped I’ll be good.  If I go red by 2k I’ll get out tho

I sold my XPEV contacts to secure some profits. That stock is a nightmare when checking your account. Yesterday I was up 50% and then down 20% and now today was back up 50% and decided to say fuck it and cash out. Fucking thing moves 5% up or down every 20 minutes but I'm still pretty bullish. Could easily reach $50 by next week.

How much money has been spent on this thread
If you're like me, and believe in the company long term, take some advice. Delta hedge your shares with puts. Don't play calls just yet. This is what unfortunately happens when WSB gets ahold of a good company and makes it meme. MM's are watching this sub, it's pretty obvious. this is very clearly manipulation to avoid paying on calls. 

&#x200B;

IMO, it'll spike in Jan, and sell off in feb with lockup period ending. We also have ER to worry about. I think it'll be good, but there's so much memey expectations that it'll probably be big dumper on ER. 

&#x200B;

I've held puts on my shares for awhile, even tho I'm long term bullish. My puts today are printing more than the losses on my commons.
Lol that chart looks worse than PLTR
You’re doing the lord’s work.
Don’t do it seriously bro, this is the future. Don’t get shaken out by whales
My cousin just realized he didnt have to buy only 1 share at a time. He is absolutely lapping my account. I quit.

Because all the restards that said not to.
Sports betting in general getting hammered.

Look at FUBO and DKNG charts from Dec. 23rd. Identical outside of DKNG pumpfake yesterday.

It tested $50 twice yesterday morning yet here we are. Maybe see a surge next month as Michigan/Virginia green light mobile sports books and hopefully NY actually votes on the bill with mobile sports betting.

GME is going to settle at $20 +/- eod and pullback on Monday. That is the most popular strike that options sellers want to kill this week.

Mods, I'll take a 2-day ban if I'm wrong. Mark it
wut time does the market close?
Maybe OP is long like 10k shares of tsla on the other side.

You may want to. Lockup expiration lead to increased float and selling pressure. Not a lot of buyers, and they’re coming up on a massive, massive lockup expiration in March. Not exactly a recipe for success.

Okay XL traders, now that you all got your profit taking out of your system, it’s time to load up for 2021: the year of EV.
To be clear PLTR is going to trade at $225 in q1 2022 🚀🚀🚀 write that down.

Yes
all or nothing.
Please dont. I’m capped at $60 after rolling the $47 strike calls I sold this week. Starting in Feb you can go as high as you want.

After staying up practically all night researching different sectors and related stocks for 2021, I would like to share my list:

1.	TSLA 
2.	TSLA 
3.	TSLA
It was mainly CRM that fucked my account. Got rid of that shit today. Everything else is down but not as bad as my CRM call
GME! GME! GME!
Go to r/antatreetbets my friend
When did u buy
Im waiting for it to go all the way down there and will double down my longs on it
Coke makes up 40% of third world GDP though.

The other 60% obviously is hookers.
I bought in at 31.30 and 52 week high says 33.50

Don't think I'm gonna make my 12/31 35 calls today.
I make my bread and butter selling covered calls on various SPACs. They are flattish most of the time. Some explode, but not all. PSTH will probably eventually, but maybe not until late Q1 or Q2 next year. I have gotten my cost basis for my shares under $20 now with premiums and my current CC are $35c for Feb. 

After those expire, I will look at my next move. My general advice for SPACs is always sell covered calls until your share price is below NAV, that way your trade has extremely low probability of going tits up.
Lol now that’s some quality wallstreetbets dd
Who else is fucked with PLTR? Down 50 to 80% on my calls. Didnt even buy at the peak. Thought buying after 2 red days and averaging down was a good idea. Ending the year down a nice 50k
ARKK selling TSLA is a lagging indicator of TSLA success, because it means TSLA went up so much that it violated their rule against any one stock being more than 10% of the portfolio.
Take a poor man's hug award
NIO close above 50 for the New Years please!

You’ve misunderstood bro. Q3 earnings was supposed to be the catalyst. Now it’s January q4 earnings. Then once that doesn’t happen it will be q1. Poor guy, it’s okay that you’re a fucking dumbass. 😘
Dude I'm just trying to keep myself in check, not fap more than 5 times a day, eat healthy you know.
Ryan Cohen's tweet obviously means he intends to take more direct action on GME to prevent the company being steered in the wrong intention. Or not, who knows

Anyway, GME  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I sure hope so :)
GME just gotta rest that RSI for 5-10 minutes until we take $20.
Just remember, you don’t lose money unless you sell
Picked the wrong week to buy ARKG.  Fuck.

Dude I was wondering that too, where you at my man, it’s ok you broke the #1 rule of WSB

The fact that GME is not blood-red today is a good sign imo
1/29 expiry.  The premium is too high for the next week (before "the big game") imo.

PLTR and GME smh...felt like I shoulda just stayed in TSLA now. Gonna 💎 hand my way through 2021 though fuck it.
Popped my stock market cherry this year in June. Went from $32,000 down to $17,000. I should have spent that money on a Kawasaki Teryx 4. Or at least had diamond hands with Tesla after buying at 500 before the drop in September
This is most certainly not the top, and you’re clearly unaware of what they do and why they are going to crush it.

SQUEEEEEEEZEE
Those 3000 shares of GME I picked up at 19 are looking good now. I love this increased Ryan Cohen activity
Do you have a certain position delta you aim for? Do you try to sell during a dip in the day or on a red day or just whenever?

And when you say you dump 40k into credit spreads, you mean 40k max loss worth of spreads, yeah? E.g. 500/505 spread on $XYZ means $500 max loss, so open 80 of those spreads?

Just wondering if you open more spreads than you can have access to cover a max loss. Obviously, that acts as if you can't close out a position early for a smaller loss. Stop limits at -10%, -20%, etc of whatever your personal risk tolerance is in case the underlying dips to prevent max loss could mean you could open more spreads, but that sounds like a really risky thing to do since stop losses don't always trigger on options, especially if the underlying gaps down on open for some reason.

NEVER!
Read up on perpetual withdrawal rates.. Monte Carlo has limitations, mainly in its fundamental methodology, there are no black swan events so the range of returns is limited. Additionally, financial planners dont usually use a monte carlo for a time period longer than 40 years.. Anything longer and it needs to be treated like an endowment, which uses perpetual withdrawal rules, and this figure is closer to 2.5%.
Apparently that was the dip buyers have been waiting for on SPY. 🙄🙄
Don't think anything is relevant till next week.

How do they have the firewall and Google if Google doesn't actually support the firewall?  Google is a key component. They use different Algos that the leadership will approve of to control the media to the masses.  IF there is a video they don't want people to see then it never trends and never gets attention.

Imagine if Trump had tried to have a story buried here?  The outcry would have had Nancy Pelosi in the streets with a sign.   Google execs would have marched (with masks) in California.  We would have had mostly peaceful protests over the control TRYING to be exerted by the president.   

In other countries though, meh, Google don't care as long as they get their pound of data.

I think they make Tequila.
Don't want to sell calls on something that could 2x overnight.
buying the calls isn't a bad bet if you don't have much capital.
I maxed out my margin buying the shares.
If the stock drops before expiry, the options retain some time value, shares don't.

You can also exercise at a 20$ strike at any time, so it would be the same as buying at ~ today's price.
you got to think like a boomer, since they have the most liquidity. 

the earlier you get on the big news the better, and you hold that sucker for years. early big buys - early big movements.

You’re right I should wait till eod and see it drop even more smh

December 7 I went in 6k on TSLA  700 calls. Sold Tuesday for a 4K L. I don’t want to play anymore
Elon’s got us he needs to ipo that holding company or take spaceX public, I’m selling all my worldly possessions to go all in on either one of those
Lmao
I’ll take my 50k in Ali baba calls that’ll be worth 100k in  2 weeks and maybe I’ll dabble in Tesla puts.
Buying GME because I want to help you guys win 🚀🚀🚀
Welcome home brother
Earlier in the week, you could put together a PMCC, which would pay between 60-80% if they announce before the middle of Feb and it moons.  If they don't, you have nicely priced calls for Dec.
It's still really down since 2016. I see the run up, I don't see what though.
I got in on pltr around 27.57. Fuck me
Anyone wanna fill the classroom in with what’s happening with GME rn?

Weird gamma pin on SPX today, if it were to creep up to ~1% green then there would be a massive increase in delta hedging to the ~380. Could swing green end of day

I wouldn't worry about it too much but it might be a year if you're willing to hold it that long. I saw a bump and sold. I'll be buying when the lock out ends.
Don’t cry when tesla is 75% down over night.

Gotchu boo, there’s a new girl named bam bam and she might look a little older and thicker than the rest but god damn can she work that pole.
I had 210 shares of Tesla at 350 which I sold for about 10k. I could've doubled my portfolio if I just held the damn stocks for a month or two. Fml.
Assuming no bubble. 2021 is going to be a different year. SaaS companies aren’t something I’m going to play this year. They’ve had their moment. Physical hardware and strong moat or bust IMO.

PLTR lock up ending is what caused this dip?
Are these the $705 0 DTEs? Was looking at them at 10AM when they were about $2.50 a contract
GME...I didn't buy enough in the dip!
Nah too risky. Just gonna hold all my $$ in SQ and CRM. I have 1/15 PLTR calls that will expire worthless but whatever 😡

So my dog has recently been sick. We just switched to Chewy, same brand of food. When we took her to the vet they said that we shouldn’t order from Chewy because the way they store/outsource their food could be causing the problem. Not saying one thing or another, but if vets are recommending against Chewy that could be trouble

GME,
NVTA,
ARK (G + F + K).

I'll just wait for y'all to come back up. Try not to take too much time. I got some Jan 15 calls for one of you.
Public service reminder from the TSLA fanboy:

- **ARK selling TSLA** is basically just a backward looking lagging indicator saying that TSLA just had a nice run-up. Which you can determine by looking at the chart. It has zero information content with regards to the future.
- To be fair, this cuts both ways: **ARK buying TSLA** is generally just a backward looking indicator that TSLA just had a major dip.

So no major predictive power in it: ARK was buying at $200 pre-split last year - but they were selling at $250 just before the glorious Q3'2019 earnings that set off the short burn of the century. 🤷

RIP the naked calls you wrote, that leveraged your short position from ~100 to ~300 TSLA shares - a ~$6k loss on today's move I suspect?
I really enjoyed your post. good luck in the new year!
GME is the most engaging and exciting stocks I’ve ever owned, next to TESLA. Red days are buy days for me. Diamond hands soldiers!!!! Thinking about pulling 200k from my 401k into this.
I think it’ll shine 2021. Everything’s getting shit in today. But ya the drill isn’t ideal
PLTR, why are you gay? Is it because WSB FOMO into you? Please go up.

HOLDD - it's just a red day.
All I am thinking is tsla and gme aiming for the bushes
But GME also doubled in last 3 Months
Shorting Tesla is a room temperature IQ play in 2020. The fundamentals went out the window 6 months ago. But I will be doing prob a 10k short for mid 2021 if it hits 800. Michael Blurry just shorted it lol. My friend sold 300 of his 500 Tesla shares that he had an avg price of $87. He sold at SP inclusion and is pissed cause it’s still running. I told him in hindsight it’s sucks but in the longterm Tesla won’t see this price for a long time if it does pop.

Everyone is saying that to TSLA before but honestly? PLTR looks like the superior tech. Why? They fucked the US elections. If that is not enough, for you, you ain’t black
It threw a bull flag for algos post lunch when it fell to 713.16 and then consolidated until breaking 715. That gives it headroom to push to 720-725 and depending on power hour will determine Monday in the new year.

$7,500 in 1942 is equivalent in purchasing power to about $119,737.27 today, an increase of $112,237.27 over 79 years. The dollar had an average inflation rate of 3.57% per year between 1942 and today, producing a cumulative price increase of 1,496.50%.
Yeaaaa
Thanks for the post
Fucking google it
will pltr ever have a green day again? looks bad. all the articles written are negative, everyone on Twitter just talks about flipping it (which is not good either), and I think Ark sold a little (although I think they still have a big position). Think Mithril bought more, which is good? I don't think the lockout period is a big deal, since I think that's priced in at this point and people know its happening.

Yeah good work. The support at 40 would’ve been nice but thank god you got out when you did at 35. Praying on IPOC for you best of luck
Imagine thinking TSLA won’t just get bigger and bigger. Where are the bear bubble boys now?
The more impressive part is the 25% discount on purchase. Best plan would be buy, then dump when able. Its more of a rich person is guaranteed to safely get richer thing.
PSTH will be 2021 meme stock of the year.
welcome
well thats it Thailand has now crossed the line,  2021 is online  and headed your way ....
Tesla is going to fall badly in Q1. 28B in revenue and market cap is higher than its auto industry competitors combined that do 1038B in revenue.
WHY DO I KEEP DOUBLING DOWN ON TSLA PUTS??
Ok, maybe you WERE brave enough to downvote that last post. But there’s no way you’ll do it to this one!
For sure, enjoy being reminded how stupid you are in a week
Siri play Slow and Low
No, NIO is up 2000% this year while boomer TSLA is only up 750%
GOEV better get the F moving... 🤡
GME 🚀🚀🚀
Oh fuck yeah I'm not selling a damn share. It's just pissing me off right now
As a side note, if you like gaming I highly recommend Persona 5

Its like a "slice of life anime" fucked a JRPG inside a jazz bar
with stores shuttering, there won’t be many angry store clerks to bash their management’s heads in on an anonymous platform

so, as the great michael Scott says: win-win-win !

Yeah those 3 plus ARKF are my new safe picks that I'm buying weekly on.

You don’t have to be retarded you just have to be not poor

How about now?
Two four day trading weeks in a row ouchie
That $600 stimmy in the mail!!! Hold the line brothers 💎🙌
GME finally.
Did you hold any or sold them all?? I like to leave a runner or two for maximum squeeze
That’s cringey
It means that the short should exit before they go broke
Sadomasochism is such a turn off

That’s a bull flag on Tesla for post lunch. Easily hits 720-725 today. With power hour being the determinate for tomorrow. Breaks 715=bull sinks beneath 713.16=bear/flat
TA is basically stock astrology
Ever since some dude bought $3.4million worth of SOL it has absolutely tanked. RIP to that guy.
Lol absolutely not.
Anyone wanna buy a portfolio? I had a guy value it at 15k yesterday. I'll give it to you for 10
Government contracts will not react with as much volatility as consumer discretionary. This will be a slow, long term growth.
+24k since July. First year actively trading. Next year's goal: 6-figure club by summer!
GME is the current *pump & dump* I guess?
Yea, buy it
Got some 17/2/21 26C

Would you hold?

BABA LEAPS ON DISCOUNT
Can you take me with you?
If GME squeeze gonna happen in 2020, would make perfect sense on last day of year...!
you should check out $DEEZ and $NUTZ
TSLA up 20% just this month 

wtf just wtf
I bought earlier this year at $17.76 sold at $25. I reentered now at $21.95. I think the next earning speculation will drive this north of $27.
Or a hint that the shorts are about to be F’d

Let’s do this gme 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Do you wake up in the mornin' and say, "I'm puttin on my big Bear pants. Look, I'm wearin' a bear belt. I got big bear pants on!"? 

Put on a little bear jacket, you go,...you take your fish lunch cause you have big bear pants on?! You got your big bear pants and your fish snacks?!
Lot of BABA profit taking from people who jumped-in at \~$211. As long as it doesn't break-through 230 support, I'm holding
It’s a bear trap actually lmfao you’re new to this aren’t you?
goddamned down 11% today and my options are just staring at me like, "why don't you cry about it"

which hurts because they can clearly see i am
Bruh
Daddy Cohen tweets, I buy more GME

At least when they’re called they can pee it back out.

Im in at $17 with all of my money plus some of my margin and watched it sink down to $12 after earnings. I know the feeling. It's rough to watch, but hanging on pays off. I pretty much shit my pants watching it climb all the way up to almost mid 20s. We're climbing hard in January.

hot rolled steel prices gapped up 17%!!! today. not at all worried.
3 straight green premarket days. retail investors are retards.  just buy and relax
If you were bag holding GME for months and months you’d be up over 100% right now so stfu
I sold the dumbass PSTH pump and threw it all at ICLN
[deleted]
Should have just done it anyways...would have made like +20% in the last 3 minutes
Raisin
Are people still pumping GME? That always seemed like a short term play.. new console cycle.. holiday buying.. possible short squeeze.. if you have gains take the money and run at this point.
ARKG c'mon my dude .
only if $10 in the next hour
LOOOL RSI on the day for TSLA shows its currently oversold 😂😭
Moderna tanking. But why? They gonna sell 4 shots per year per person

OSTK :(
Balling with you mate. Printed before last share dilution too.

Are you holding until Jan 7? From what I understand they confirmed the terms for the release of 36m shares have been met and the official date is Jan 7.

I’m up 200% but not sure if I keep holding for long.
Are you joking?
2021 is the year of the 🐂
Narrator: It could and would
Holy fuck tesla wtf
It’s almost like it’s on fire sale everyday!

Yes by about 600% this year actually
What happened here?
It can theoretically go much lower. 23 dollars lower
no blood til 4 like usual
That’s my music
Lol, it took less than 15 minutes from linking my bank account and less than 20 minutes from opening the account in the first place to get approved for options on Robinhood as an unemployed person (and admitting to it).

This topic has been posted before. See u/cpthubbard 's posts on wsb
PLTR does everything.

From helping to fight crime to cyber protection to analyzing what toaster you're most likely to buy next at Walmart!

With that being said, Palantir, stop dipping you pos...you're disappointing your millions of fans!!!
So this Mfer on CNBC, she is the one buying BKNG at these insane valuations. How tf has the stock not gotten ahead of itself? Lol anyway she just fucked my puts again.
We are smart enough to not fall for this bull trap
SPX is barely down but today feels like a blood bath.  Theta fucking.

Buy more weeklies, got it
buy the dip on Bilibili?
Mitch does not want the $2k stimulus checks. The only reason 230 is in the bill is because that way he can look like he’s putting forward a $2k stimulus Bill, but in reality he knows 230 is a nonstarter and it guarantees the bill won’t pass.  He did it this way so he can claim he tried and blame the democrats for “blocking the stimulus checks”. Don’t lose money on political theater.
Going to enter the new year with some extraordinarily heavy bags 💼
kept buying since 136... a falling knife my friend...
Amen.
it is lmao
Selling the January’s in a few days so it’s in a new tax year. Rolling up into later expirations
Buy the dip, you're welcome.

yah, good luck with that. enjoy your 4 dollar stock in 2 months.
Whats happening with BABA
Solid DD, OTM puts Jan 8 are skyrocketing
Think it's sports betting in general taking a dump -- may be FUBO dragging everything down with it. DKNG/FUBO charts look identical since Dec. 23rd.

I'm just beside myself since I made a big bet on DKNG last week for 60c 2/19 and just my luck this shit tanks 20% in a week on no news.

Doesn't help my other position is CVS 70c for Jan/Feb expiries and it's bleeding out too.

Last week has been pretty bad and DKNG isn't helping.
Never breed.
This thread printing like TSLA now 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🔥🔥
Congratulations🥳 You'll hate it here soon! Keep getting tendies and you can leave like we want to😂
The 1080p/4k is worth it to me. Im probably a victim to the algorithm but now 80% of my porn is the ph members only videos.
None of those. But if I HAD to, I’d marry qs, fuck micro vision, an murder PLTR.

A better choice would be ICLN, ARKQ, and SQ.
Mods please ban
Facts.
Don't buy stupid german derivatives. Just buy calls, then you could've sold today.
More sellers to break down below the range box don’t we want bigger intraday swings again people ??!?!?

Been looking for a decent telehealth play, someone mentioned AMWL and I think I’m in. At IPO price, seems a bit undervalued, well reviewed apps. That’s all the DD I need.
id rather buy reddit gold than buy gme shares, thats how retarded this play is.
Stop options playing palantir you retards. Palantir is just for buying shares and holding. Stop being a fucking paper handed cuck and just wait for it to moooon
apple dip is so obvious but.. guh it keeps dipping... 3 STRAIGHT RED DAYS!? CMON
Money being valued 1/1300 is insane... fucking pocket change makes Melon drool...
how are lean hogs doing to close out the year?
100% this is just refueling. I’d be surprised if it goes to $20 or lower levels
Posts like this are the reason I wait before redeeming the 24h free awards that Reddit gives out haha 

Have a hugz and just ask spez to give you a conversion rate between awards and gme shares.
Yeah I mean long-term definitely still bullish BABA hence the trade. They weren't naked puts though I don't have that kind-of collateral. Took several $5-$10 spreads. Would be $20,0000 collateral for just one of those. Thats pretty much my entire account. If I held into today I'd be dead so glad I got out at bell yesterday.
It’ll turn around by feb! At least that’s what I’m telling myself because that’s when my calls expire lolll
I too up my bets in Vegas when I'm deep in the hole
You is smart, you is kind, you is important.
QS bottomed yet?
Dude no time like the present, this EOD rocket is gonna be insane. Or purchase weeklies for next week and sell mid next week or something.
Yikes I’ve had that stock for two years now not worth it
Thx. Maybe it's luck maybe it's because I stare at my phone 15 hours a day now
I just keep seeing it go up and I still keep thinking: This literally makes zero sense.

He only had $900 though
I trust that most bagholders fled PLTR when you were thrown a $25 lifeline yesterday
Ugh dude that's awful.  I'm not ashamed to say this is the first and only one I got caught up in and lost a good amount, but not more than my risk tolerance.  I'm confident it'll go higher but probably not for awhile!
I love this guy 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Meh, as long as you have good positions, these drops shouldn’t bother you. I remember 1 years ago a 2k drop would have freaked me, cuz that was a decent percentage of the portfolio. Almost all cloud and WFM stocks are down double digits this week. Great time to add

I hear you, but you are not really thinking about things from a supply / demand perspective. There is ample supply of money, and limited supply of housing. Same for stonks. This leads to bubble like results, but only because you are locked into the context of "oh the poors are devastated right now" (no offense intended) but in reality the rich, who buys financial and housing assets, are doing great right now. even commercial real estate is doing well imo.

Proper gain , congratulations
My break even is hard to calculate (I’ve sold many options against my “long” holdings) but it’s about where we are now.

I was told this was a January through April before it would start going up and I’m still in for the ride.

Today/early next week might be jerky as people reposition their portfolios (and by people I mean those with more buying power than what probably 90% of us have combined) so I’m buckled in waiting for the liftoff.

That said if you’re actually thinking this is going to hit $300+ In a few months please realize that the guy shilling that information has gotten more and more trolling each post, even hitting $30 in April would be amazing.
I want every man, woman, and child to give this man your free rewards.

Not sure I follow your logic.  You’d make more money had you bought in before it broke out.  If you want to learn better TA let me know.

I know you won't believe me, but you cannot go wrong going long on TWTR. Only risk is market risk, which is not insignificant heading into January.

FB has much more at risk.
Early 30s
Well first time playing PLTR gang hope this is the low point right now just loaded up on some calls
Loaded up on airline and cruise leaps. Seems like a no brainer
2 months ago people were calling 700 EOY and getting laughed at
This stuff never works for me
i believe so
Did I see amd mentioned? Calls on amd? 51 63 calls on amd? Say no more
Skateboard?
I'll admit it, 1DTE OTM TSLA Puts purchased yesterday were not the move. Thank goodness for smol stimmy to recoup losses. Rest in Peace 680Prince

110 shares of Palantir and 12.6 shares in AstraZeneca. I don't usually invest in stocks but was convinced after thinking about this. Also my friend has been shilling Palantir since IPO.

Does SPY have exposure to SPACs, PLTR and GME? If not, then this sub don't give a shit.
Sold me. Here's the deed to my house
Kicking myself a bit for selling tsla at open. Shouldve waited Just a little longer
Normally I'd be pissed but Cathie has been so good to me this year I'm just like "Ooh yooouu." 🙃
Man can tsla dump for me to buy back
Neat

Support has held at $23 so far. Hopefully it stays that way.
My dumbass loaded up on apple yesterday instead of today... went long but could of got in at a better price today
Happy new year, my dear retards and autists. May you make lots of tendies this year.

I think it just happened, look further up in the comments
How often do y’all check to see how much money you’re losing?
Why the fuck is GME going anywhere that fuckin company is going to go under
Yeah buddy!
I knew I should of bought uvxy calls
Predictions on what he is saying here?

My guess is "if you transitioned for a digital future earlier you wouldn't need to catch up now"

Alternatively, "short sellers can cover now, or cover for a larger loss later."  (Not likely but I live in dreamland).

I'll take both.
Yes but remember, its only 1 day. What ever youre down on will recover
Imagine if Tesla puts ads on the screen during self-driving... hours and hours of captive audience...

Profit taking is for losers

Any thoughts on shorting TWTR or FB in the off chance Mitch gets his way w/ 230?
I just keep buying PLTR and MT because if you paper handed fools keep giving me discounts I’ll keep taking them
It’s the thought that counts! 😊
Canohealth, if you know you know. Getting ready for the next leg up.
Jesus fuck. This post is worth more than my entire life savings.
just stay above 230 baba
man it's fun to watch the idiots on stocktwits get all riled up about TSLA
Diamond Hands does not pay off.
Bought that AI fake pump.
Buy options retard
Morgan Brennan tho 😍
All shares, started with about 400k. Honestly if I had just bought and held I would have made a lot more, but I was constantly afraid of the second crash coming. Missed out on a lot of the big jumps.
Let’s do it, everyone buy your TSLA for the EOD monster run! 🚀🚀🚀
\+93% YTD
Fuck off
My realtor says this is totally okay nothing to worry about. no bubble.

Nah son. People are literally selling shares all through the thread at a loss. Also, No one should be having a big potential on PLTR options to be worrying about that. PLTR has always been a long and gambling with options.
Fuck these manipulation bullshit. Month of gains go out in one day
i already have my left nut in pltr, buy the dip n dip my right nut?
TSLA earnings in january buy the run up

Nobody talking about it but it is up like 2-3% every day. Got shares in the roth..
Who had Apple puts show yourselves!!
PSTH is working hard to win over this sub
Also, TSLA is insane man. I’m not even in it. I just can’t believe it
up 36k (95% gain).  was a great year shorting the Covid crash, but stayed bear too long and gave a lot back.  Went long on NIO(around $15) in sept and it brought my account back to life.

Hello WSB. I hope this tutorial will help you understand how SPACs work better. I made sure to make it easy to understand, and empower you all to perform the best trades.
Here’s New Year’s resolution for you PLTR:

Fucking hit 30 in January you POS
It's behaving like target announcement is coming today or Monday.
Can confirm, though my $20CSP 2/19 is pretty red smh
Cool well guess it’s time to close up shop and not open Robinhood until February
Everything is going down besides Tesla
America literally did this whole December. Market opens decently in green and then sell off....
🤣
Can’t believe I sold my snow puts this morning
$1.5T if I’m remembering correctly. Don’t freaking downvote me hater. 😂

The wrath of Cramer is upon us
It’s four thirty o’clock somewhere
I'm fucked in pltr ATM.
They’re warrants on moderna and baba. Sadly I can only sell them in Germany. Didn’t know that exchange here is closed since 2 pm 12/30. was 30% up.
They’re Knock-out warrants. If moderna goes below 106.40 or baba below 223 then they’re 100% on loss and worthless

Appreciate the dedication to the bit.
You need to look at your realized loss and gain. The net is what you pay tax on or claim a loss.
how do i do that
That means you are fucking retarded and bought QS after it went up 1000% in a couple weeks. You deserve to loss all your money you retard

My thoughts exactly. Even if you bought any dividend stock at its low in march, any tech stock outperformed its bounceback plus dividend. 

Dividend stocks are good for lazy boomers who are about to retire. Thats bout it

Yes!
Are you buying so deep ITM because of the premium? Wouldn’t an OTM call be better?
Then why is covid going up tho
I expected a far bigger drop today, kinda happy rn
They were retardedly good back on the day. A WWII $10,000 war bond was sold 25% off for $7,500, and is now woth over $93,000 (Edit: if you were retarded enough to hold, smart person would cash in as soon as possible, inflations a bitch)

It was literally free money because the bond costs less than its base value. 

It was like a call on the American military industrial complex combined with puts on Hiroshima.
I am gettig straight fucked today boys. Not in a good way either

Almost bought 700’s on the dip this morning at 2.50, and now I’m starting my NYE binge drink early.
Basically I would say their bread & butter is sports betting integration with live streaming sporting events. Essentially they are looking to build the ultimate live sports experience all around the world. Watchers can place bets on games with statistics. At the very least they are aiming to have the best sports streaming experience that is not cable. People love sports obviously & have you heard of casinos??? Now it gets interesting with how things play out since they are new and also have to make headway with gambling laws etc.... so if successful this could be HUGE but nothing is a guarantee and they could fail
This is Saving Private Ryan

i gotta feeling DKNG isnt gonna do shit till mid to late 2021
First step of grief is denial
Yeah. I did not mean to offend and I definitely did not intend  gloating, although I can see this now. I was just shitposting.  I don’t have anything riding on them as I tend to be a part of the herd and hear about things after the fact. Never enough time to do DD and have been caught in pump and dump schemes far too many times where I lose money so when I do read about this sort of company, I am always late to the table too do anything anyway.
Whenever tsla is up on a red day that’s super bullish
It'll peak and take a nice dip
No it wouldn’t, because it was the split that caused the price to go this high. Added more demand
Sells calls my dude.
Why isn't the market closed today at 1 pm like most holidays?

They are thought compounding early, as it’s what made most of the last generation ‘rich’. Along with this you have to remember they don’t have very reliable income. It just makes more since to pay the ~200 once and have it produce what your gonna gamble with; it’s slow and shit, but it’s a strategy.
Is this your first year buying stocks? I’d assume it is since you think you cracked some code. People and institutions sell off at the end of the year for tax purposes/rebalancing their portfolio.

Imagine buying stuff in Germany on murican stocks and won’t be able to sell since yesterday -.-
PLTR is volatile as fuck, so it can easily swing back in the other direction. I’m holding my 26.5 1/29 calls
think everyone needs to get burned on the stove once to learn that you don't fight cult stocks
Literally zero upward momentum on PLTR. Pathetic
Which python API are you using? I use yahoo finance...

Oh yeah. So, faking being Spanish is in. Got it. Cool name.
I'm betting it dips again in the next week as people anticipate NIO day and a heavy sell either before or after

it's up 3%. spacs regularly fluctuate 3+% for no reason.
What is it with old people and bonds?
Not again
Just long AAPL is also my lesson.
Nicely done. Don't doubt your vibe!
You POS PLTR.  Just move up two pennies and fill my sell order ARGGHHHHH
I mean on the surface I agree with you but RC took on Amazon in the pet space and won, if anyone can turn GS around it's him.
Someone tell me bagholding this PLTR is worth ya boi 💎🙌 I’m just margined to the fucking gills and not tryna blow up

This is the lunch dip. Super mild one too. Easily rockets back up at say 12:45
Whats the point of having a full trading day when all they gonna do is sell
You’re right. Unrealized gains just hit differently
Going to need NIO to moon on monday.
Then why are covid cases spiking?
I think there’s gonna be one more Tesla pump to the 720’s then it’s gonna timber buy puts then

 Maybe for a company from 1 Billion to 10 Billion Market Cap. But not from 50 to 650 billion in one year. This reminds me more of the Volkswagen Bubble with some completely different story in the background.

According to Fidelity, I'm up more than 100% for 2020. 2019 was great for me till...Feb & Mar 2020. Bought some poots at the bottom cause of separation variation. Learned  my lesson lol. Switched to calls and short poots.

Okay, first off, birds are literally dinosaurs. Dinosaurs are badass. If you said "the CEO is a House Sparrow" with a negative connotation, that'd make sense. But you find yourself in the wild, it's off in the jungles of New Guinea, coming up against a full-grown, 5-foot tall Cassowary (which the CEO looks quite a bit like) with his 20 or 30 friends? You *lose* that battle. You lose that battle nine times out of ten. And guess what? You've wandered into our shock (yes a group of cassowaries is literally a *shock*!), and we now have a taste of bear. We've talked to ourselves. We've communicated. 'You know what, gay bear tastes good, let's go get some more gay bear'. We've developed a system to establish a "shock and awe" strike pattern and aggressively hunt you and your family and we will corner your bear wife, children, your offspring!
this is the fast n furious scene before he says "i only race for pink slips:"
Don't short Tesla you fucks. Yes, I want to as well. Yes, I know its a speculative bubble. Just don't fucking do it.
So that’s why bag holders sell otm calls the next few weeks and lower are cost average before the next pop.
Yeah, don’t panic.
What a shitty week
If Tesla alone went to 0 the S&P would drop what like less than 2%
It's just profit taking for year end. Should continue to rise in the new year. But Jan 15 may be too early

Who knows... my buddy used to work there and would always tell me how the company was constantly having to downsize because of shrinking sales, and that was before the pandemic.  They have not been able to compete with direct downloads and streaming games. Not to mention they were shutdown for awhile there as a non-essential business. No reason this thing is up over 200% other than a classic pump and dump.

No.. it requires much more buying power, but at least you have theta and other greeks as tailwinds instead of headwinds.. plus i want to be short TSLA at these levels anyways, borrow rate only 2.2%, so idgaf if i get assigned on a weekly..
Idk man I think Venmo has the potential to be just as valuable as Square in terms of use in a more cashless future
yeah i already know this. Excluding my selfish reasons it’s pretty crazy to see a majority of americans on board with one issue. Meanwhile Mitch just says no because of “fiscal responsibility” which wasn’t an issue the last four years.

Oh yeah. Volatility in 2 weeks max
higher they rise...
since a lot of people are doing a lot of preventative measures (masks, social distancing, disinfecting) and the regular flu is not as transmissive as covid, its occurrence is very low this year
Looks like a lot of selling pressure above 13.15. Someone doesn't want this to run just yet.
2.31%. 12550 -> 12840. Managed to climb out of a -2k hole
Don’t sell today atleast wait for market close Jan 4.
UVXY as we head into Tuesday’s Georgia elections seems like a smart move? Buy now and sell the pop Tuesday midday as exit polls show tight race or Dem lead. And then get back into your other equities as R’s probably keep the seats and get the Wednesday morning pop.
I wonder how many of them are

I’m sitting on $50c for 2/5/21, nio day will take this to the moon. I will take profits after I see a ceiling and buy at another dip. Buying weeklies sucks ass due to theta, very unstable imo.
Surprised at how far $TTD has fallen this week. This thing is normally a beast

I mean, yeah.. but i don't brag about that part because karma's a bitch.
Who’s that one again?

If PLTR hits 20$ I’m throwing my life savings at it. 🚀
Everyone wears masks and social distances if not staying home who’s getting the flu dude???
I have had a rollercoaster ride with just reading about this company. I might go long on them and see what transpires.  I typically am part of the herd and when I hear of things it is usually too late for me.

Enjoy GME @ $15 next week retard
We all like to think we can time it but that’s rarely the case, unfortunately. Apple is always a sound investment so I won’t disagree with you there. However, I truly think PLTR has great potential. It may have its ups and downs but long term I like it’s outlook.
I’d rather pay it later in 2022 after its had an extra year with inflation. 🤷🏼‍♂️
ARKK ARKG AAPL BABA all drilling my portfolio, idk if my diamond hands can take it. Are they all going to the moon before Jan 15? Am I going to regret if I sell today?

This is wolf of Wall Street
Kinda 50/50 there... nobody likes to hold over the weekend, but... TSLA.
Should it ever not? I didn't think so.
Yep. Selling cash secured puts and making back 10% easily. Doubt it can drop any lower and if it does, it already down >50% so it can go up.. Even if it doesn't go up you can sell covered calls and you already make back 20%.
I got in GME 40C for July. Let’s fucking Go🚀🚀🚀
I wish I could buy but robinhood cucked me and said I can’t buy for a while
Sold half my Tesla positions today. Good time to take profit before lunch. And possibly buy back in after the daily lunch dip.

Buying more PLTR thanks for shitpost
I made 25k this morning and took profit. So no not exactly
enjoy your bags
you can still claim losses until the 31st in the US. Unless you short, then it has to be settled by the 31st.
oh mein gott
Pretty much the exact same boat but bought and sold about $100 later than you. There was a point where I was upset, but it’s just gotten ridiculous now

PLTR bag holders. Sorry lads
I think they can get to TPX enterprise value in 3 years.  I believe they will approach 1b in sales in 2021 and 1.6-1.8b in 2023. These are wild ass guesses but that’s my instinct. If they can continue to grow like that then they will trade at a big premium due to their low debt level and high return on assets. TPX has about 1.3b in debt.

I LOVE how full of this shit sub is sometimes. If you Google "percentage of day traders that lose money" you get an instant pop up of 80 fucking percent. That means 20% of traders make profits. But not this Sub, based on 100 comments looks like 92% have made money

What news?
Hilaria Baldwin is selling PLTR shares.
Wow this is next level retard shit.
Is Tesla gonna timber or nah?
Buy NIO any day in 2021 and profit by end of year huge
you can buy logins on the darkweb, probably regular websites too I just dont know where.   


I used to get mine on AlphaBay, and they would always work, but I dont think thats around anymore
Yeah for real, I've stopped resisting and I've joined now, it's much nicer on this side
Why do you assume I haven’t been to college and already have a career?
Not soon enough
RKT is probably my worst trade this year. I think it'll go up eventually but god damn, what a stinker
Wait until ER late Jan. It will be massive.
Check out the $INTC rally, all because some dude pointed out they’re shit
Probably for the best, it would just make you sad
S&P will be the biggest bag holder lol
They go to jail. Jail sucks.

But the Affleck speech is $$$.
Institutions are buying they know what's up you think they don't know with that kind of movement?
After 100 fights I have brain damage and I’m buying calls on PLTR
anyone else thinking about SNAP calls?
March
You think RIOT still going to go up?
Don’t tell me how to waste my fucking money take that sticker bitch.
paper hands
Well when TSLA goes down in the morning and people on WSB are talking about the prices of puts, that's when you buy calls.
For me googles vision is really simple: AI.

They thought they could solve it & change the world; they came up short & are floundering. That company is ripe for a management shift, which probably wont be happening. Instead they are headed to be the next intel, decades of profits with no real innovation
Gotcha.  You are okay with stimilus that is given in the form of tax credits but don't enjoy tax cuts.  Makes complete rational sense.
Ever heard of oxford lane capital?
I'm retard enough to buy TSLA puts
Jeez DKNG pull up
Buy riot while it’s dipping 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

yes
Some insane put premiums up for grabs on these meme'ers like QS and FUBO.. christ. On FUBO you legit pick up 40% more premium than the trade costs to put on in a margin account.. it's insane.
To appease the wsb gods that’s why
I’m heading into 2021 with tears
JD wtf brO
If PLTR becomes the new RKT, I will lose a lot of money lol
I’m in the cabinet. I am complicit in
Watching him grabbin’ at power and kiss it
Finally wakes up, looks at portfolio, sees a lot of red, “oh well”

WTF is that 1 hour graph eBay
Same bro, same
Haha *im in danger*

https://ibb.co/XFNk8hd
Bro that's the future pirate King we're awarding.
That’s a tough break guys...those calls must be an eye sore at this point. Probably load up on cheap calls 6mo out if you’re still sure of pltr tho...
higher than it is now
It always melts up on low volume.
Whoa wtf. Why such a selloff
Certified autist here, bought in at 28. It has to come back up right? Don't tell mother 😭🚀🚀🚀🚀
wtf is this crazy volume on TSLA during new years eve?

arent most MM's taking it ez today? imagine if it's just 1 person fucking with algos
Palantir is drilling LOL
I want an award please !!!
Oh tim apple pls moon in the next couple weeks or I am royally fucked
Sold today seconds after open with a small profit. Will reinvest after this drop.
PLTR puts
Can't you understand that? WHAT THE HELL IS WRONG WITH YOU PEOPLE??!!??
What’s your expiry?
The best part of this is that the science checks out.
Elon has a huge PP

Trust me
Pltr weeklies are pretty cheap
GHI-v is absolute entry point right now.

Sold my Tesla calls 30 minutes before news dropped yesterday. Would’ve been a 3000% gain hell yeah I’m good at this
Cramer on TSLA: where are the sellers!?!?!?!?!?!
I’m going to take the rest of the year off from trading. See you all next year!

+18.62% on all meme stocks(tsla, pltr, gme, amd) except for i put $200 into TMO in july
So just buy it now
[removed]
You win
Source?
They raise price target yet CRM crashes another 5%. Fucking retarded stock.

This market is utterly irrational
So now that the S&P is bag holding the biggest bubble in modern history who is going to crash first? Tesla could legitimately cause a gigantic flash crash
As someone who bought in at $195 pre-split and sold at $715 pre-split, I understand your pain.
Think those two events people tend to expect something innovative that disrupts the market and get disappointed.
LMAOO go get em soldier

Yes
Can't believe I made money from a QS call this morning
There's a lot of married ppl, some heads of households. I file as head of household for example, so I get stimmy as long as my income is less than 112.5K

For options it does. 65 cents per contract.

Wtf, you really are retarded including NIO with those other shitter stonks. NIO is going to explode and you’re going to miss it, it is one of the greatest plays for 2021
Piercing pattern on the weekly.
Contrarian indicator
Wow. I gonna donate my free silver award because "fuck it." And because I have to get rid of it in 24 hours.
Nope, just a perfectly cool and legal but def not insider buy in
2050
TSLA is insane. Honestly
Ok I have $500 to get me rolling into the new year, any suggested yolos? Or hang tight?
You just became an investor
brosef. Its hard to do but dont let the 24 hour news cylce of bullshit get you worked up and sadder. Live your life, invest money, create your own $2000 through smart plays. Waiting for congress to help you out is a thing of the past. They cant even pull their own heads out of their asses and work together.
now that's a name I haven't heard in years
the zuck has been cucked 

but the musk has done the suck
Waiting til it hits $16 next week then it's a buy
This is fucking hylerious
$60
I’d buy 17.50 Jan 2022 purple calls.
Thanks
6K today.   I hate this stock and im not done unwinding this crap.

Hi I’m the goofy who got In spy puts in the morning and down 20% still
I like my plays. Maybe if something changes with these three.
Let's say you successfully catch the falling knife. It ain't going back up that fast. This company can't scale. Might as well invest in Apple.
TSLA fucking kills me. I could have bought this at any time over the past few years and trounced my performance in any other ticker. And now it’s up 3% again while the rest of my shit is down 2-4%.
Tsla getting too heavy now. Might be time to bail for the day.

Should I buy RIOT shares???
Who takes advice from someone who admits to panic selling? This sub is full of fucking pussies lmao
I'm just going to cry about my 117 shares @ 28 until it comes back up. Because it has to come back up right? I'll make mommy proud? Right?
Nio 50 price ceiling fml
OSTK should change its ticker to JFC
OUF.. opposite for me.. i had MRNA at 68.. sold it at 73 when Trump fucking crashed the markets for 10 minutes with that stupid tweet and i needed  the liquidity.. fucking worst day. Then they come right back and MRNA moons days later.. fucking cunt.
You're probably right on #2. But yea, who knows the future. Maybe the sell off is priced in.
Just smashed my computer into itty bitty pieces.  Algos wanna fuck me? I'll kill their whole family.
The autistry is mind boggling
this type of shit is the real reason reddit doesnt purge this sub. lmao the sub brings in way too much money
looks like a dead cat on the 1 yr chart
Caught a buy rating today and will announce quarterly deliveries next week. No need for conspiracy theories.
For some odd reason this reminds me of Tesla battery day
Correct, retard. The trades have to clear which takes 2-3 days. If you sell today it won’t count until 2021.
Snow'r is a show'r. Well played short sir. Get you a 20 pc tendies.

If you're not buying this PLTR dip then you haven't learned anything
What reason is there to sell on the 31st? I’d think people would want to hold for the new year for taxes?

Retards.
Sold my retarded PTLR calls for a small L and rolled money into shares, I feel like this is the least retarded play possible for me
I like it. Airlines are best performers in my new self directed retirement fund. Bought them literally rock bottom though
LMAO this is not how I intended my birthday to start off like.  

Already down 17% today

There goes my +100% gain for the year 😭
Roflmao
Lol ok
Sure, right now, but I'm talking about the rest of the year, so your statement is incorrect
Nah- utz isn’t a yolo. It was just a small play I did based on same TA I read. It was successful but it ain’t gonna double.
No hes still 35b poorer than Jeff Who
I doubt the advisor knows what an option is let alone how to pick a date/strike.
imagine dumping 20% of your portfolio into PLTR at 29 and not TSLA  when it was around 400 for months, oh it me
Found it out right as I bought all my ARKG monthlies. My account is teetering between $0 and $20k.
The call is coming from inside the house
85% or Americans are eligible for stimulus checks. That many people that make less than $75k

You can still close your puts and buy shares. It's not too late.

Yep, don’t need to be reminded of my extra chromosomes when I look at the diesel
I encourage you to buy shares or LEAPs. 

They're going to have a significant increase in new contracts based on their case studies for Foundry, their commercial software.Check out how Palantir helped BP and Chrysler's businesses, BILLIONS SAVED

Meanwhile, they're tracking down terrorists and preventing attacks with Gotham. The CIA has said they have to use Palantir. Its essentially sole sourced out of necessity for various government departments

i actually like it as a dark horse and the fact that wsb hates the mere mention of it makes me think it's going to do nicely in 2021.
I'm trying to buy awards for my own comment.  Am I winning yet son?
Lol 😂 how u feeling today
Haha! Yeah, I’ve definitely eye-humped GME, but it seems too crowded for me. I don’t trust my ability to time it either.
>You always want a stock to go down before you buy.

stonks go up
I bought at $139
There’s no way you’ll be courageous enough to downvote this post you dastardly down-voter.

Have you seen their earnings/EBIT compared to their market cap, it’s all speculation... do you perform any sort of analysis dude
I hope so
People downvoting you because they are so emotionally triggered and projecting because they're stressed about their drawdown because they made moves based on euphoria and not on logic and now they are reactive and want to lash out. If you're one of them and you read this comment, enjoy your new PS5 box house. Blame yourself for your own stupidity and don't get upset when people call you stupid for being stupid whether they do it directly or indirectly. Don't do stupid things and gloat about it and then get upset when it doesn't work out and people call you out for doing what you were doing. Next time, be less stupid and employ better risk management. That being said, best of luck tards and godspeed, we'll have more meme stocks next year.
Gonna install Palantir Gotham software so it can analyze how much money I've lost holding their shitty ass stock

my cock is *THROBBING*
Last day for that in the US was the 29th I think.
Well you could just look at the current valuation and then add this relativ on top of all the shares available from the 7th and you‘d know. I‘m to lazy to do that but it should be at least half that price
Pussy
Ok I’ve seen a lot of retarded comments but this one makes less than zero sense.
Honestly fuck palantir.  Why the fuck didn't I just buy tesla
I bought TSLA 30 shares back in October when they were 420.69 a piece as a meme. Sold them later that month to move my money to something more interesting because the stock wasn't moving. I belong here.
good thing boomer clarified the WSB was the one on reddit, I almost wasn't even triggered
Nio pretty strong today too
I dumped it EOD yesterday for puny gain when futures got bid up at 3:45 then MOC came in way to the buy side. O well bull market wanna bull 🤷🏼‍♀️
How about PSTH?
Lol, downvoter in full force?
I'm trying to harvest losses and I just can't stop flipping those NIO $50c for like $10 profit over and over.  Think I'm an addict.
How u feeling now
Fuck my $31 12/31 calls.
I’m a full blown retard since 2018 , kinda surpassed Autist a while back
Sell now. It’s toppy short term
Cum
Full day today

Where's my Palintards and GayMErs at?! I tried to warn you retards yesterday to sell all your shit and hop on the TSLA rocket! 🚀 

Congrats to those who listened 🤑

For the rest of you delusional autists that think GME is a sound investment, see you neckbeards on January 20th, when your Cheeto president will be out on the streets. And so will you! 😱🥭😵
No weeklies, long calls. I have mine in feb on NIO

I mean if you had looked at the hourly MACD, RSI, trend lines, literally anything you would've seen it was overbought and waited a week or so to get in. The market will always be there, no need to buy in the second you feel FOMO
PSTH + Bloomberg  = 🚀
Refueled at $23.80 no regrets 🚀🚀🚀
How about nkla?

Right now I’m up 46% thanks to green energy plays. In November I was up 298% again thanks to green energy plays. Lost a HUGE chunk playing PLTR. 2021 all in ICLN for rh. ARK’s for Roth. Godspeed you tards
Just close them and buy TSLA like you should've been doing all fucking year

PLTR $1P printing today
[deleted]
definitely has worked all month and people should totally keep doubling down!
Just gonna say this again here: PLTR won't go over $30 and will be massacred by MMs until early February. Then, when those fat boomers get their entry price nice and low (thinking around $21-24), it will see the growth it deserves. 

Now it's a high IV stock good for theta gangers and swing traders, just don't buy options before February. Like i did in November. Jan 15 35/40c down 99%. FUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK!!!!
Gonna pump all next week, bottom resistance has been climbing all morning, smart money is slowly loading up, won’t see it below $50 again.
Gonna pump all next week, bottom resistance has been climbing all morning, smart money is slowly loading up, won’t see it below $50 again.
I only have a few hundred shares of PLTR at 28. I ain’t even sweating the dip.Probably buying calls today or Monday for 1/15/21 25. Great year for PLTR, I’m just happy to own them long term and will be adding shares throughout 2021.
LOL @ those who said TSLA would crash today 😂😂😂😂 get fkd
Other than exiting one bad PLTR call for next week, there is nothing in the red left to harvest.  They better never alter the long term capital gains tax or I'm going to go postal.
Not really- that’s why I only put 30% of my short term gains in the fund.
I mean I lost like 23k to it and developed a gambling addiction but then I look at rocket emojis and it all makes sense
How is that exactly?
All in on RMO calls.

Its not an economics play, its politics. Just on its own, GE is garbage; but they are in a good position to get free money from the govt. I think its likely
Not available in NZ/AUS either
Yeah your 1099 will show the wash sale for this year with no allowable loss.  Then next year you will get credit for the loss.
BLNK puts are free money
I literally can't wait for the fall.  Anybody with any sense at all knows it's coming.  Too many rational people just thinking they will be out when it happens.   It will be glorious unless it sucks the general market along with it.
Sometimes I Google the company.
Depends if you are looking for a quick buck or money in a months time
Btw when you buy NiO never sell it, at least not until 2023 when we reevaluate. This thing is going to pull a Tesla this year mark my words. Remind me end of 2021. I shit you not shorting this stock will only lose you money
Lowered PLTR weight in the fund from 0.8% to 0.61%, still a statement........
[deleted]
I know what PLTR *doesn’t* do:

Make me money for this entire month.
https://i.imgflip.com/4s4x5q.jpg
They are gonna unveil the new sedan on the 9th and you expect order figures on the 9th? All this new sedan tells me is they are becoming more competitive by releasing new vehicles they don’t have in their fleet. Nothing that makes me feel that stock price is gonna rocket up after them telling us about it. It’s the battery service figures I’m interested in atm
its alright, i joined wsb discord monday w no expierience, put $500 in, made $1k, and then held onto my calls thinking it would pay and lost $900. so im still up $100 but it taught me a good lesson.
Puts are free money
These rewards are getting out of hand. You guys are full retard.
Anyway GME 🚀🚀🚀
Smfh.
Eventually Palantir clients will see that the CEO eats bird seed and they’ll cancel contracts

Yo, I hope you make tendies but let us bulls have today, short literally everything else that's red today 😁
30% this year. Although I lost a decent amount on BABA on my ROTH that I refuse to count 🤡🙃
Lol CNBC. Those guys trying to justify Tesla. 

Guys basically just buy any stock and say it’s not expensive based on future prospects.
I saw this it’s hysterical, forever WSB
Everytime PLTR dips I consider loading up on more shares, but damn lately seems like all there has been are dips. Nevertheless, may load up on some  more PLTR shares
a bunch of rednecks waving confederate flags?
This well age well
There are so many WSB retards out there that WSB1, 2.... 69, 420 must be taken. So you go with WSBA, B, C...
And after being launched, this is how we found out that a fund could  🚀🚀🚀🚀 if the only position it owned was itself.
Yeah, I still don’t see how people running up the price of Tesla, or bi*tcoin, or anything else effects you personally. Just stay away from the speculative instruments then. You can still go invest in apple or Disney or amazon and make a killing because of improving fundamentals.  Tesla is not the whole entire market.
😂
If mango lets market die next week no chance
Where u see this?
is baba gang still alive and well?
It will be ok once it hits 21.5
Tesla short volume is at an all time low right now so your statement is incorrect
or maybe the fact that the vaccine isn’t perfect?? Which is a statistic that we knew

Yeah this definitely won’t be like TSLA battery day or AAPL events where as soon as the event starts the stock tanks from big firms selling the news. Definitely won’t be like that.
It's only worth taking losses if you're in big dick/rich people tax bracket.. of which i doubt most people here are.. if you take the loss you only save like 0.15 for every dollar of losses, and that's assuming you even made enough money on other gains this year to have net portfolio gains at EoY. Which i also doubt is very likely in here..

I want to buy puts so bad omg
IM NOT FUKEN BUYING
Yes! 🙌🏻 music to my ears! When is Battery day? 20Million deliveries coming up next. 

Level up today is $729, I say we close around there today🚀
I like renewable energy but can’t justify paying the crazy multiples it has right now. I consider myself a value investor, not growth. When the FED stops printing we will see multiples contract substantially. EV, renewables, SaaS are sectors that will be impacted the most. I may invest then. Don’t like to invest in the middle of the hype.
Myself to the moon! 🚀🚀🚀
maybe time to retire

Wait for it to go below 130

Anyone happen to get a ss of Tesla at $694.20 this morning?

BABA will close out a weekly candle (bullish I might add) with the largest volume in the last 3 years... Let that sink in. Go look for it yourself.
Mangos Last Stand next week. Prepare for the Unthinkable.
Hmm let me see... You either collect a premium or sell shares for a profit...your right, it could go horribly wrong
Best part is that you can look at the spy from the past 5 years and see the same exact pattern
There is definately something wrong with TSLA. This is too obvious, that its not only a narrative and/or believe in the future business of the company. It must be something else. I wonder what it will turn out to be.
Looks like it’s time to realize some losses. Ya know for tax purposes.
only wsb could have a ratio like this. jfc.
Psth safe haven
How so?

The stock price goes up = profits go up. 

Options have a *potentially* greater return, but you can still kill it on stock if you have a sliver of DD and 💎✋
TSLA 400 EOY
Everyone knows TSLA at 600B+ MC is the safest play when markets are flat
Easy... always just BTFD as long as the ticker is.... TSLA.
No, the play is supposed to happen Jan - March or so, did you already forget or can you not read?
Is it this one?

Don't see it on the post.
If you look at the NIO chart it did the same pattern yesterday before it broke out
STIC ded
They gather and process the data so you don't have to.
If TSLA pops everybody loses.
Don’t listen to this. PLTR is dead. Zoom out and look at the chart.
Why root for that? I'm happy people are making money!
Shutup nerd
Thank you lord musk for wiping my sins of buying into shit memes and getting my gains back
Somebody  tell me my PLTR is going to be okay.
PLTR gang getting wrecked :(
Genius. How can I be more like you.
This, and sell diagonals against them after big run-ups. Buy them back at 50% max profit. Make money when it goes up, make money when it goes down (a little bit), make money when it trades flat.
I want to buy long dated puts but also I like money
No.
Jesus Christ.
Alright is it time to finally break up with PLTR? This goddamn stock can’t make up its mind
No gme ban
Better be, we’re becoming those end of the world guys pushing the date every time we’re wrong
This is me watching PLTR go down in flames.
F. The PLTR era is over.
Who decides now is the time to buy TSLA?
Thems some deep in the money calls.
Wish I had more :/
What I needed to hear today
GME bulls should really start planning an exit. Society's return to normalcy is gonna tank this bitch big time.
That's it?

Sorry I don’t speak poor
Bet that felt good today
I'll officiate.
Bft is gonna be huge, paysafe is gonna report great q4 earnings too cuz of covid. But I’ve lost out on so many opportunities holding cuz it’s been flat. I’ll buy back in early Q1 closer to the merger. I’ve read a bunch of predictions holding bft at 100+ by end of 2021

Won’t happen Tesla will just get a higher market cap when it starts doing more shit this year ya dingus
Don’t you think that if the workforce embraces a work from home long term strategy people will be generally less motivated to do work. I know for myself it helps to be surrounded by like minded people to bounce ideas off each other and whatnot. 

I’m basing this on my own experience and seeing friends around me (In their mid 20s) shift from office work to working from home. 

At first it was great, I could finally take calls in my boxers whilst eating a grilled cheese. Slowly but surely there NEEDS to be a gradual shift and flexibility in work schedules. 
I.e 
2 days of office work
3 days working from home

Flexibility allows for the best of both worlds.

I believe that if you give your employees more freedom to choose their own schedules they will be much more inclined to think outside the box and get creative as opposed to working a 9-6 like a good robot and going home to the kids for a few hours before going to bed to do it all over again.
She will. She will.

This is to remind you bois to buy PLTR on every dip
PLTR low volume today its just all you paper hands selling. New years day and karp interview we taking back our losses back to our all time buy ins!! 🚀 🚀 🚀
A gay bear?
Yes spend your savings on Palantir and then  come to Wall Street Bets and bitch  about why it’s trading  sideways😂
This morning would’ve been perfect depending on what strikes and how much $ u have...

It has to, just a matter of time

im averaged at 26😢😢😎😎
I think we're all here for the bust posts.
I’ve used margin and options, but not with much success. 

I definitely use leverage to avoid waiting for trade settlement, but I’m too afraid to lever up. I’ve amplified more losses than gains in my past.

The same track record applies to options. These days, I try to only use options to hedge equity positions, mainly from selling covered calls.

Just bought 25 shares PLTR LETS GO BOUYYYYSSSS
I bought TSLA
Mood in here is super depressing did everyone lose except the Tesla cunts?
Its hidden. Just gotta buy long tesla calls, go to your home screen and delete the app 3 days and it will reveal itself.
By my calculation, TSLA 750 EOD easy. That's the next sell wall.

Haha, you stole my tweet!

Quickload is F7
Absolutely. I work in data analytics and integration at a large medical device company and I can tell you that being able to pull in data from multiple databases and having them depict the overall state of your business is something that’s becoming more and more expected from business leaders. However there’s a lot of challenges to that since data isn’t always accessible in its raw form and matching related records from one database to another isn’t always clear cut. Here’s a link to people’s review on their product: https://www.gartner.com/reviews/market/analytics-business-intelligence-platforms/vendor/palantir-technologies/product/palantir

That said, I’m extremely excited for demo day!
I cant wait for the day Tesla bubble pops and all the kids lose their money.
Yeah I agree but the low volume is just insane to me
Real. Good problem to have.
0dte $19 GME calls and 0dte $50 Nio calls. This is the way.

just thought the exact same thing
Pics of ure mom or ban
what to do w/ 35C Jan 31 2021?
Except TSLA
Did he pass him?
Seems like a great long term play so might as well keep buying lol
The more somebody tells you they’re a tough guy, the more insecure they are.
How do you get exposure cob mob? NTR
I haven't touched it once because it's hard to believe that's when it won't crash. I've felt that way about 10 different times now.
I always trim my position when it has crazy daily gains. And I still have 95% confidence I can gain at least another 100%. Naturally, it won’t go straight up. What do you expect will happen when they announce a profitable quarter?
Sell off imo is uncalled for with new states voting in the coming weeks/months. I think we get at least 4 new states in 2021.
I am imagining
Is elon the richest man alive now?
Bahah
Here comes the GME run.  Diamond hands and all aboard.
Besides being down 5% today I’m pretty hopeful for Jan
Please stop dipping now. Go dip next Friday instead
ARK sold 180k$ of PLTR yesterday

EDIT: not yesterday, dec 29
$29 may be its highest closing price, but it hit over $33 during the day at one point on Nov 27
PLTR should be in the teens.

17 years no profit with a market cap of companies doing ten times the revenue...plus their future is pure speculation and wishes by bagholders on wsb...

No, never. In the end this whole TSLA charade has been a bull trap from the beginning, capturing as many bulls (and bears capitulating) as possible.. the bear case is that squeezes aren't as much of a risk as before because there's plenty of shares to short.
People who make money trading- what’s that feel like?

god fucking damnit pltr. why must you test my hands like this.
Ok let’s get a consensus going here.

IF YOU COULD SUCK YOUR OWN COCK WOULD YOU?

&

WOULD YOU NUT IN YOUR MOUTH?
It is called “margin” for some reason in that app. Enable it and do whatever you want.
Yes it’s a big deal. It’s impossible to “price it in” because the entire point of it is there will suddenly be a ton of new shares on the market that insiders want to sell to diversify or buy a house or what have you. There’s no way to price that in because it’s not a function of price, it’s a function of shares becoming available that they can’t sell until that day no matter what the price does. 

Options can potentially price it in via sky high IV, but that’s rarely the case in my experience.
Just buy more on the dips bro, what makes you think you're going to be an expert at timing the perfect entry on a noisy stonk?
THERES STILL TIME

I know that feel. I lost a ton on BABA getting fucked in the ass and XPEV/NIO doing offerings right after each other. Sometimes this shit just happens though. Need to just sit back for a bit, buy some passive buy and hold shit for a while, reset and come back with confidence in yourself.

People tax harvesting PLTR before end of year ; she drilling
Stocks falling again
The wisest trade of the last trading day of the year that I've seen

/s
I think its a fitting way to end the year: everything dropping, but not Tesla.
GME IN THE GREEN LOSERS
Yeah maybe not a ranking but just a “year in meme review” kind of thing. Everyone just brings up their favorite moment, potentially within a few different categories...I.e. favorite gain, favorite loss, favorite overall yolo, etc

And I totally agree. This year especially has been incredibly eye opening for me in understanding what legit traders actually do to make money. I had such a basic analog understanding before thinking it’s just either buying or selling stock when it’s really this glorious wonderland of options and coordinated strategies that you can tailor to make money off virtually any kind of expectation
Less yelling and more rocket ships. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

idk how dropping to 23.75 is bullish
I am not vested in the vaccine companies, but just take a look at moderna.
Cost less, more leverage so you can sell CC’s on the LEAPS. Shares don’t have Greeks so that’s a advantage of that... essentially LEAPS are a lil more risk than shares but can provide more profit.
My karma will never recover from this

Remember dont panic and sell while red. Im down 35% on my BABA calls but these shits dont expire til the end of feb. Just ignore em for now.
Congrats bro, and welcome to America the fucking place where anyone can go from rags to riches. The fucking American dream
Why is everyone talking about BABA and not PDD can someone explain to me?
Imagine selling TSLA
 Whats going on with apple for the last 3 days. Green in premarket, big red dildos from start to finish. Wtf
He worth 220 mill, im sure he will avoid the food shelf
It is still dipping low, new low everyday. I have 175 shares at 27, waiting for it to dip around 22 to buy more. I am good if it goes back up, so no harm done.
Big money pushing it down to 10 to get better coinage when it goes to mars 🚀

This ROR is about what pro Bill Akman got ytd. Proof that you don't need to be smart to make money.
It’s in the post 😳
Seems like not many losers posting. First trade of the year had 6k SPY 293p Aug exp that I watched go up 300% in March then rode them all the way to zero. Also had 3k DIS puts up 100% rode those to zero as well. Then had another trade 0 dte spy puts, lost another 10k (30% of my account) in 1 day. Recovered some on hundreds of other smaller trades and big share positions on GME and PSTH. Only down 10 or 15k ytd. I consider that money well spent for a years worth of education.  

Biggest lessons : 

- don't get rammed repeatedly by jpow printer hulk dildos. Flip that bitch over and ride them to outer space
- Spacs are somehow free money until they arent
- Ryan Cohen is our lord and savior in him we trust 
- Alex Karpe diem PLTR gang for life
- Valehalla was real for those who believed
- if you live on top of a hill NKLA has some trucks to sell you. And trevor is still somehow a fucking billionaire 
- 🌈 🐻 shall have our day. Someday. Until then we shall don our horns and pretend we enjoy fucking the  wives and girlfriends
there is absolutely nothing that they can do with gamestop that other companies dont alraedy do - better.

Walmart and target sell their new games cheaper.

Ebay sells old games cheaper - and allows you to sell your games for more income (only lazy retards use gamestop for tradeins).

Valve, Epic, Geforce Now, apple and google app stores ... they aren't going to be competing digitally ..EVER.

So ... their best bet is online retail? lol...hello amazon!

You guy are so fucking retarded it hurts.  Please, for the sake of your money, just sell this dumpster fire and stop getting all dumb over your WSB loser bros and their tribe of nitwit 12 yearold traders.

# TSLA 🚀

Never disappoints! Rumors that it might be added to the Dow? Anyone confirm this?
I understand this. But there are only 3 choices:  
1) Sell everything now (-8% loss) and start over (but who knows the future?)  
2) Sell half of shares now, and use this cash to eventually buy other dips  
3) Do nothing, if drops hard then in the next month I will average down again.  


Probably the best choice is number 2, the most agnostic one.
Forreal though. Stock has been pretty stagnant since its big jump in late November. What's the play moving forward?
Do you understand delta, theta, and gamma?
Technically yes, but buying at over 10% above the current price is so dumb you’d assume he wouldn’t
You safe brother?
TSLA seems scary, but you can day trade it in both directions
Confirmed. I sell options to retards.
Part of me wants to say fuck it and do it now, but I know the bubble will pop the second I do

Just buy Tesla shares/LEAPS. No one sells. And the dip is always bought.

Not if you only look at the TSLA chart. It's the opposite. Would recommend.
TSLA 2020 420 ➡️ 3600

NIO 2021 50 ➡️ 420

You obviously didn’t read Cohen’s letter stating he/RC ventures would do everything to increase shareholder value.

Sherman and the other boomers caused the stock to flag for years, not seeing any reason to move from B&M model. They moved the ICR talk into the technology tranche for a reason.

Go ahead and short it, I dare you
They real dream is single pane of glass for multi cloud and physical for infrastructure management, container movement to cheapest platform real time with data mining. PLTR should have been acquired by one of the companies working on the single view. 

Data is now more valuable by atomic weight over any other mineral.  So I am a fan of PLTR.
lol hoped nio could break 50 by next month, how high do you think it can go?
Buy GME then buy Reddit awards on Margin.
Haha. Keep rolling them until you can’t
guys, can't you read his username? he's an analist. he's clearly better than all the other autists here by a good chunk
No reason to buy leaps deep itm. Atm should be fine or slightly otm
the value of the option can increase (decrease) at a higher rate than if you bought shares if the price goes up (or down).. more risk, more reward
Imagine if options didn’t exist. I’d suck my own cock for entertainment. Then nut in my ass
PLTR gang don't hide. Post that sweet sweet loss porn. I know you're out there, huffing paint.
Can WSB IPO already?
Did you make that call?
If you ignore a stock that people are talking about and consistently making money on then you are trading with one arm behind your back. This is how you lose money.

Long Tesla, thats the meaning!

Every candle the past hour red. FUCK this
They’ll just blame it on Pltr 😂😂
You fundamentally do not understand what the word “greed” means and it shows. If you wanted to call me foolish, we could have that debate. But this has nothing to do with greed. 

Also I closed my call and made 8% on the day 😉
Imagine still holding GME? LOL
I figured it out.  This is the run-up to TSLA earnings in just over a month.  It's just started a little early.  Get in now for new year tendies.
Man I hope that bear that put $20k on 0DTE TSLA puts sold on that dip this morning...
remember when TSLA was this price pre-split a few months ago? good times

That is retarded Boomer Logic. It might work, because Biden is a retarded Boomer, but it still makes no sense.

A) That deficit is in dollars, which US can make at will

B) Cheap still stimulates the economy. Expensive steel slows down every other industry

I loved those 20+ dollar swing days this year - I did however shit my pants on multiple occasions when my account had money due over 20k multiple times because I held overnight on 4x day trade margin.  Each time was worth it, and made a new friend at schwab.

I bought these way back when they were only $3.50. My only regret was only getting 40 of them.
FCEL about to breakout!!!!
It's gotta be Cramer
Does it make any sense to buy leaps deep in the money? Like where the premium and strike together equal the share price today. I’m calculating profits for my price target and it’s basically identical to buying shares. 

Any advice would be helpful

I think SNAP is my soulmate, the second I buy it, it sky rockets. This isn’t the first time either.
To be fair, 250 miles is still above average today and the battery is one of the few parts of their platform that isn't proprietary tech.  It's good enough for an urban vehicle which will be offered in cities where the charging infrastructure is already in place. The sports sedan will have 300+ miles, which is pretty good.
How does them buying a stock hurt you?
Still trying to understand how options work. So if I understood right he is betting on TSLA to go down to a specific price before market-close today? Instead TSLA is going up today. 

So how much will he lose?

Grab some more TSLA calls on this pull back
05/21/21 40 $ call . 
IS THIS THE PRINTING MACHINE
Tesla is just too easy.  Keep selling puts, irs free money.  It will never go down.  Thought it was insane at 2000 pre split. Now here we are at 720 again, on its way to 1k in q1 and 2k by summer.
It’s crazy to think if I had just YOLO’d into Tesla the entire time I would have been infinitely better off
Bought in 500 shares @ 17. Got out nearish top at 58.5 before it hit 62, bought back in 300 shares at the 40 support (I thought) - once it broke the previous 36 support like I sold at 35.85. Gave money back but still came out good. Staying away for now. All in ipoc today at 15.55
Minus two but I couldn't get the order filled so I took it at 1 and then I watched it crash on market beat
Whole 9”s of SNOW
I thought there was a shortage in Italy. You'd think price would go up🤔. Go balls deep long on futures.

I mean, for YOU, i would.. but if i put limit at 0.05, some greedy market maker would snatch them before your order even makes it to the exchange!

These people never post the DD they do; because it’s shit
I hope it hits 29 before 80% of the stocks are available in public because I dont think it will moon quickly then. Just bag holding it, I can't afford this kind of loss now. I dont see it going below 20.

How do I turn this play into more GME shares?
Damn GOEV is never going to find the bottom
This world has no respect for us. We work so hard to get tendies and the big boys all plan to sell at the same time. We need to tax the rich 90% on stonks so we can control the market 😈
People who bought the dec 18 TSLA dip are geniuses. Serious mvp today.
GME TO THE MOON 🚀🌙
can you sell them for 0.05? That's all I got. $5!
Oh shit you are right. I was taking a glance at the 5 year using robinhood. Welp, I guess I should’ve waited longer. 😂😂

\-The total Mattress industry is 30BN.

\-Half of that is in US (I bring this up because...puts on the middle class. People will be sleeping rough in the future)

\-Prpl is currently 2BN

How much room do you think they have to run, and why?
+88% for 2020. 

AMD, PLTR, and AAPL were my best tickers and made up the vast majority of that profit. Lost a few grand on some meme plays, including having to close 15Jan $20 C on MGNI for a loss before it mooned to cover a margin call. 


All in all, great year. Outperformed buying the absolute bottom of SPY, learned a lot including how to sell options. Going in to 2021 looking to outperform spy and outperform “buy and hold” AAPL. Sticking mostly to selling options on larger companies like apple but will still probably yolo some pltr here and there after lockup expires.


EDIT: WORK was my biggest losing play. Sold off a month before the salesforce buyout announcement. Otherwise would have easily been my biggest winner of 2020.
Nio get in now before it pops again
Did you get there without trading with leverage/options?
I’m all in on NIO but if we know about everything that is going to be announced on NIO day won’t that already be baked into the price of the share running up to NIO day? I’m debating selling me 1/15 calls before NIO day or do you think people will hold?
Covid vaccine profits are going to barely be a blip in PFE PnL sheet.  It’s good for PR, but it’s not going to boost profits like Lipitor or Viagra.  And long term, if it’s effective and the WHO actually puts in a competent effort, Covid vaccines are maybe going to have 3-5 years before they get put on the shelf along with smallpox vaccines.

IV increased, propping it up, maybe?
I will be so mad at myself if Tesla doesn’t see below 700 again
Who knows 🤷🏽‍♂️ but I just made a few grand easily 😋
How much of a deduction
Why did I not make even 5k on tesla this year? I only had about 50 chances to get in on 5%+ days
That's just wsb tards with weeklies tho 
I bet it will be well over 40 by 2022 but will see it's fair share of ups and downs along the way

someone was pumping M a r a the other day. I knew it
She wants to hold, but TSLA is rocketing so fast that it keeps passing the 10% limit of ARK make up.
Does she even understand how 401ks work? Your money is safer all in Tesla at this point.
Thanks man, looking to hold pretty long term. Seems like the only play that makes sense with this stock at the moment at least
PLTR holders where are you
[deleted]
Of course it was fomo. I would have sold by now for most any other stock but... Pltr has just enough hopium to keep me in the game.

If it's true that MMs are artificially keeping prices low then we gonna moon eventually
lol sentiment went from 40 by 12/11 to 40 by 2022 pretty quick.
XL not dead after all?
Yeah, selling CC is a pretty safe way to make your shares earn some money for you, at the risk of loosing out on potential gains, for some stocks that don't have high volatility selling CC is a great way to make free money essentially.
GME will soon feel what is PLTR anally prololapsed 💎 👐 will feel like with month long declines.
In a few years, probably. The IPO flopped because they did it in a non-traditional way. This is probably where it should have been after IPO.

I kind of agree, however I believe that the essence of memes is how they‘re being used and how they manage to capture certain feelings so well. Quantifying them might take away from that, but I agree that the memes on here are fantastic.

As a kid I always thought the stock market was kinda boring, but I‘ve become a whole different person since I‘ve been able to YOLO my savings on meme stonks.
Same dude, i bought 8800 shares at 29. Cant believe I became this retarded, it was FOMO if anything.

Have a hug
Up 170% ($50k -> $135k) for the year, mostly from buying tech stocks (SQ, AMZN, PYPL) and TSLA on the March dip. Made more money buying and holding stocks for months than I did with options, but the luck I had with options was from calendar, butterfly, and diagonal spreads.
WTF mara. FUCK
Data my man. It’s the new oil.
"dont double down on losing options" they said. but as a true retard i kept doubling tripling my 700c TSLA fds from 2.67 all the way to 1.65. never doubt the musk dong 🤑🤑🤑

Explain that tesla shit first.
Hold tight brother. If you're comfortable increasing your position if it comes to it, consider selling puts around 18. Getting 4% premium on weeklies = 4% more stock to buy to bring your average down if you don't get excercised!

I mean, I'm bullish on PLTR and don't wanna take the L either and sell my stocks at a loss, but please don't try to convince yourself or specifically seek out any information to confirm your confirmation bias. That's extremely dangerous in trading. PLTR likely will suffer a heavy fall but what are you gonna do. :^)
In 10 years there will be a movie about the TSLA stock and how it turned out, in one way or another.
"please let Matt know the options" - little did she know that you are not a boomer holding shares anyway
I started in Feb too but had no idea what I was doing, got spooked by the fat drop early March and having zero experience, I sold my tiny positions for a little loss and forgot about any sort of stock market trading until May :( so much potential as I started out with $5k and I'm currently chilling at $13k. So not bad, but damn... I really should've just bought a tesla leap and held

Didn’t some dude make like 1 million starting with 500$ On Tesla options at the beginning of the year or something ? Was that one in a life time thing and just by luck?

Don’t EVER FUCKING sell Tesla options until 3:59 pm on expiration...
You're right, but not all these shares will be sold at once. Let's see
Fuck PLTR
Tesla is literally retarded. Nothing supports that valuation.

I wish they’d start announce installing FUBO TV in the NIOs

At this point I'm just going to wait for the earnings run up but I'm never playing this boomer bullshit again

Why aren’t the things that WSB said were going to happen happen? Cries in 12/31 calls

Haven’t you learned over the past year?
**THIS JUST IN**: an important meeting of the sky gods was just interrupted when TSLA’s giant green dick burst through the floorboards of their meeting hall. More at 10, back to you Jeanine.

Hmmm....no more buying the dip it's a great company going tot the moon?

TSLA up 1,000% in 52 weeks

i am so sad i bought PLTR and lost like 10k. fuck me for listening to people here
Easy tax harvest to end off my year, all as plan 😎
Looks like a lot of ppl are salty they’re not in on Tesla rn lol
[deleted]
I agree 100%. when things go this high, and so many retards and asslickers are in the stock, they just won't sell, and it perpetually rises. 

I will be dipping my toes in the put waters as well

I jump around usually but Trading view has a lot of ideas people and pt other than the big corporation price targets set. It also shows you technicals so you can get a feel for how the market is reacting at a given time.
damn that tesla 0dte call i almost bought this morning doubled in value. i’m such a pussy fart 💨 scared money don’t make money
It’s past it’s ATH. And yeah that’s why I was shorting it. Ridiculous valuation.

Tesla is ridiculous
whew - dodged a bullet there !
You made it!
Still getting shorted. They are throwing the kitchen sink at it.
I regret bagholding PLTR... 

It’s probably going to crash to sub $10 after lockup period expires. 

Look at FUBO... their lockup period expired and their float tripled and they have lost 10-20% daily since. 

PLTR float is going to 5x instead of just 3x....

The entire world has vaccines provided by PFE for years this isn’t going to move the boat fam this is literally their business it’s not exceptional.

The sheer number of bearish bets around then makes it sure that it won't happen... Just like the presidential election volatility expectations. Thinking surprise immediately next week or couple of weeks after
I've got more time to max out the IRA right? The deadline isn't the same as fiscal year right?
Remember to wear steel gloves when catching falling knives friends
TSLA shorts more willing to realize their losses than TSLA bulls willing to realize their gains. Incredible that TSLA can keep getting squeezed over and over again
apple probably best eod play

Tesla Tequila is like the quality of $20 tequil

TSLA up 6% in a week. Vanna gang in shambles.
Ok guys I never spam this fucking hard but a fucking 0DTE TSLA moon mission happens once every couple months and I always fuck it up, Im so happy to be a part of this one 😭

Either 1000 or 100
Lol TSLA was hovering over 0DTE puts like 10 minutes ago being a pussy ass bitch works out sometimes
You just got the memo this morning?
"Dumping". Dead flat from yesterday's close as of the time I make this comment.
Had 1500 beginning of Jan. 

Bought a tesla weekly for 300 that ended up being worth 9k 2 days later(crazy lucky). Bought puts at the end of march and took that to 20k. I kept buying puts though... and i went back down to 9k. Nio brought me back though and now im sitting at 27k with mt, arkg, and sh1tcoin. Had about 5k of deposits throughout the year.
690.42 or 420.69 obviously
[deleted]
Bro I’m 20 and from Mexico moved to the us with 0 dollars this shits amazing 🚀😂
Where is the GME short attack? I was trying to buy the dip today. Can’t even get it below $19 yet.
I swear I can make a penny stock move 0.01 percent by mentioning it in this sub.

If $24 isn't the bottom, next stop will be $19

Dear autist,

Wasn’t Yang. Was an “advisor”. Was iCarly’s prediction. Yang wants to give you a 1,000 a month for your future tendies.  Unlimited bread sticks and a 1,000 a month on tendies?  It’s a deal.
🧻🤚s
Grabbed those PLTR shares a little too early methinks
I witness this
If i lost 1m this year, i get to claim 3k in my taxes forever.

If i lose 1m the next year, do i get to claim another 3k for 6k?

Been a wild year!
She grounded to destroy all options at 240C
Good because for some reason I bought 820 calls lmao
Swing trading TSLA is too stressful. I’m just going to hold for 20 years.

!RemindMe 20 years
What do we think the bottom is here? Be realistic please. It tested 22 st the last bottom so not sure if it'll test lower or 22/23
ban again
Currently about 16.5k profit on 7k initial investment, starting April 28th.

Currently with 100 NIO shares
5k in PSTH leaps
2k in SAVE leaps
Difficult time for stocks as people are taking profits for year end taxes hence all the selling pressure.
Its still trading at a discount to the index and its ETF. The green box is an important area of support otherwise next level is at the yellow line.
See how it hit the 150% extensions perfectly. When it got there unfortunately it had lost value and so institutions took profit there instead of the 200% extention.

If you refuse to look at a stock people are talking about even if it’s overvalued you are trading with one arm behind your back. But with that said don’t take what people are talking about at face value. Do your own research and you’ll be okay.
Anyone here ever hear of this company called planeteer? Basically they create excel macros and sell them to governments. I am considering adding them to my watch list.
dumb question but where do you research for these stats?
I'm so used to XL dumping I don't even know how to feel
GME 19-20 consolidation is actually really good. It means there will be fewer shares for shorts to buy :)
Nvm, just checked my trading account, started the year with 27k not 45k and it’s at 590k (Tesla be creeping up today) so return is 2,180%. 45k the number I was thinking was when I sold everything to short the market in feb.
I paper sold my 715 but now back in on the 720
Yes it does you cuck
[deleted]
Get in TSLA now!! next stop 720!
Please let him know the *options*

He’s hinting that you’re not retarded enough smh
Tesla is just incredible
At the rate the TSLA bubble is inflating, it’ll be back at $2000 by the end of 2021.
Stop shorting Tesla, Jesus man.  Move on to a different ticker.
Someone is handing out ternion all powerful awards like they’re made of GME shorts.
Got mine yesterday
ffs AMD you are tanking on no fucking news except some jackass that own 1% of INTC want the company to try something new, are you fucking kidding me? This market is straight up a clown. Get the fuck outta here
Hang in there chief.  Nobody knows what the fuck is going on with TSLA or why it can continue to be so overvalued.  Plenty of opportunities to come in 2021 - don't blow your load on just one trade.  Close the computer and go do something fun!
TSLA's daily is so insane the March dip barely looks like a blip along the way.
See how well AAPL did last earnings...
I was thinking more of airlines and cruise companies. BKNG about to get back to its ATH, is that why you're shorting it?
Gay ETF gang...
Poor guy is so fucked
is it too late to get into TSLA?
2k lol I pay more in margin costs for the year at 3%😂😂😂
Don’t give me an award
Yes buy when it’s overbought /s
Lol what are you talking about it’s up 20% in december
yes & will prolly say it again until it moons

i hope I'm holding a lot of stock
It never cared
TSLA pal. Thanks for the gains but you don't have to keep trying this hard all the time.
This did not age well. Never bet against Papa Musk.
My mom said thanks too
MU nice short
Hang tight.  Your patience will be rewarded.
why are apple calls for earnings 1/29 not free money right now. they seem super cheap depending on how tempered your expectations are
After breaking 685 the next pt and resistance line was set at 750 before breakdown. So I’d say honestly just hold off til then
Lol bitch mitch left the stimmy off the senate schedule again
Shares* but yes you are a pussy
Is this satire?
...how do you know what TSLA should be trading at?
I’m glad to be back from my 30 day exile.

For clarity, this is Carly's idea, not necessarily agreed on by Andrew Yang (he wasn't even on this episode of the podcast.)
I’m up on it
2k aint changing lives
Puts seem a better choice.. I think it will bleed down to 3100s

I’m touching my pee pee
I’m certain 😭

Tax loss harvesting it is then. Good luck to the retard who bought my shitty T calls. Can’t wait to have that awkward conversation with my account about how we maybe don’t mention my 90%+ options losses while my wife is in the room... I will be sticking to stocks in the new year.

I would like to sincerely thank Midas whale for the hugz award I had received last night.  It was a rough day for me and it brought a hint of light into my otherwise dark life.

Cathie taking hits now but you know 2021 going to be a good year for ARK
Shares will be unlocked very soon to be sold by early investors after the 90 day ipo period. So like 80% of current shares will be available to be sold.

Must hurt with your shares tho, I hope thats not a big part of your portfolio. Don't paper hand this and you should probably be fine, doubt PLTR is going anywhere.
I only play spreads on Tesla , I’m too of a pussc to go all in 🤧
Time to pivot to SPACs

Buying calls on a stock that has gone up nearly 20x since a year ago is greedy asf. Never said taking a month off is bad genius
Pennant
GME been such a bihhhh this week.
this guy made these millions on that fucking mattress company
Yes
Because you are desensitized to life due to wsb.

Imagine going back into a real casino now. *Boring...*
Omg it’s going to be a blood bath (insert each fucking day here) y’all are such clowns sometimes literally thinking the market is going to crash everyday. Sell off season is over time to buy shit you reee reeees
ENPH didn’t move much considering it just got added to the SP500? Was expecting more
Give it time my dude. Great dip buying opportunity; whole market is down and early investors taking some profit. This bad boy is on to $40.
If you like pltr at 25 you gonna love it at 21
Tesla retard power is insane
Knew who it was just from the legendary P/E ratio
Is gap filling just an urban legend? The last 2 stocks that I’ve followed that had the opportunity (FSLY and SPLK) failed miserably
This would have been my worst week since September if I wasn’t loaded up on TSLA and didn’t buy the BABA dip.

Everything else has gone to shit
That's the secret, it never dumps if you buy monthlies
If Tesla could do exactly what it did yesterday, that’d be great
Got in with a measly 200 shares at $13. Thetagang

Should've bought puts then unless your strike is like 25. It's gonna keep dropping through lockout period, that's my bet. Then it'll turn around.
Imagine thinking your life would be any different whether you have 1 billion or 100 billion
na buddy more like 20. I got in at open on Mon & bought it at every dip. it's 90% of my port atm & 50% of calls net worth is wiped out. Fuck this & everything 🥲😞
I just joined this sub like a week or two ago, had no idea why everyone calls each other retards, autists, etc... and then this happens

It’s all starting to make sense
You guys get invited to parties???

$26. Was up like $2500, now down like $1500

Annoying
Anyone loading up on AMZN calls for next week?
are y'all still buying in on TSLA?
Not holding but last I check 10 mins ago was worth 10.00
can someone tell how much money was spend here ?
? 

If you mean will I for you? No. 

If you mean am I asking OP to for me? No. I don’t even know Python so it would be of no use to me and I’m already working on my own.

Should have bought more TSLA calls...
Fuck I love Tesla , but I have to be the one to say it boys get out before that dump kill us
no
Does it show citron ass raping a bunch of weekly calls? While holders watch their tendies go down for the short term? If so I’ve seen that movie too many times.
I see. I followed advice like this but always end up losing money. So I will take a rain check on your financial advice.

ITM calls are very expensive which thins the volume compared to OTM/ATM. Because delta is basically 1, nobody will trade them when there are perfectly good shares to use. So there's not really a lot of demand if you want to sell your call early. Sometimes when you're close to expiration (like <1m away) it's actually more profitable to exercise and sell the shares rather than sell the call.
THANK YOU 🙏🏼
Hey Guys -- I'm thinking about trading in shares outright of Pelaton and ETSY for Disney... I think Disney has more growth upside... Do ya'll agree or disagree?
Shares - 15% of my 401k and roth ira portfolios. Calls are too expensive, maybe not at the end of today though lol
I've got 20 of the 1/15/21 12.5c
Stocks crashed the moment I woke up. I just need to sleep forever to make money.
I'm convinced Motley/Stocktwits is just a vehicle for pump and dump tards who take payouts from insider traders. Fuck them all, its why they hate us since we have the retard strength to go against their 'trends'.
Just moved 20k of psth to GME. 12 days until blast off

Username does not check out
18 is my buy-in price. I haven't bought shares since it was below that. Flipped some calls afterwards, but I'm waiting for it to dip below $20 to buy back in, and I agree, it'll get there, before it rises again.
how heavy are your bags
Double your money the easy way. GE $11 EOD calls for a penny
TSLA closing over or under $715?
We back
Nope, not today.  Just closed tomorrow.
I had a TSLA 500p 12/31 a couple weeks ago
I said “the fomo on Tesla today is going to be insane” at like 9:35 this morning when we dipped to 693 does that count?
Why are bulls so fuk in Dec man... theta gang feasting
got conned by rkt on that last pop once again. fool me once....
honestly, good for you Tesla. Godspeed you Black Emperor
Tesla is just under the price where "stock price is too high imo" was issued. Time to do it again?

Great entry probably
How do make work for me?
I swear GME dips right under 19 and bounces right back just to squeeze people out of their stop losses. Don't set stop losses you motherfuckers! That's how I lost GME at my  average price of 11$ and reloaded at 19$ from that premarket pump last month

Happy new year from Bermuda
I've read some TA by others elsewhere. It can go to 16 if support at 21 breaks. However, I hope that 21 is strong enough. 16 means for me -40%, not good.  
At this point I will never sell, I'm too deep in. The 100 shares at 31 are in another account, I almost never think about them, just focusing on the 450.
Whoever suggested yesterday RMO is about to fly, I would like to wish you some huge hemorrhoids in the new year. 
Enjoy!

Good lesson learned and you got chance to take life by the balls still. 

Went to college for economics and finance. Had a job soon as I graduated. At 27 I was a full blown addict working in an investment bank, 700$ a day on pills, 401k loaned out to the max, -800 in 2 bank accounts, 32,000$ in credit card debt, and about 12k in defaulted student loans. 

Today I’m 33 and in just about completely out of debt, minus a car payment and because of the habits I picked up save a huge portion of my income. At 27 I was with a girl planning marriage, then I walked into detox. Got my life together and realized I didn’t love her like I should love my wife. 

Today in 5 years in recovery, work in an entirely different field where I actually like my job and married the love of my life in august.

GME 🚀🚀🚀
What a fuckin autist
The good news about Cathy’s etfs all basically being the same is if you lose on one of them you can just sell, realize the loss, and move on to the next one. You essentially have 5 musical chairs to keep in rotation so you never have to actually be out for more than a month
No prob
This is not Yang. Lol. Yang to give you a $1,000 a month for your future tendies and your wife’s boyfriend account.  If Yang is elected maybe he can take her to the Olive Garden. Unlimited breadsticks.
So of course I paperhanded my TSLA 12/31 700c yesterday, and bought into ENPH 1/15 195 at open which is now of course dipping. FFS
Sold another set of $18 putts on GME today (1/8 exp. this time) and bought another 20 shares with the proceeds.

Currently flat on PLTR, looking for re-entry soon.
Taxable account: started with 45k in Jan now at 588k (1,300%) after withdrawing 18k for taxes. That account started at 16k last year. Mostly Tesla but also SQ and Upwork and amazon. Also shorted the market in feb/March which gave me more money for Tesla.

Roth +290% from 49k to 245k. Also mostly Tesla. I got heavy into them a few years ago and have just been picking up shares.

Edit: Nvm, just checked my trading account, started the year with 27k not 45k and it’s at 590k (Tesla be creeping up today) so return is 2,180%. 45k the number I was thinking was when I sold everything to short the market in feb.
TSLA this is very cash money of you
WHY THE FUCK DID YOU SELL AT A FUCING 53% drop. YOU FUCKING IDIOT
once u get out it will rocket. im long anyways and holding, even though i got in at 27
A very happy new year to you as well

At least you're not alone
Soooo you’re saying it’s going to moon next week. Got it 🚀
Is this the award line?
Well it’s partially what you can afford but I’d say first step is 401k to the match and second step is maxing Roth or if you have the option HSA just because both are so tax advantaged. 401k is much harder to max obviously but if you can then obviously go for it

Well, I also had tsla shares around $25 back in 2013/14, sold around $55. I feel u brotha.
so im thinking of letting my $109 covered put on QS get executed. Should I do it and sell covered calls until i make my money back? or should I get ou given that QS had a major run up and is still crashing?

Hey has anyone here ever bought calls on pltr? They are looking pretty cheap right and and I am thinking some $30c that expire next week is an easy win 🤡🤡
Cause it is Carly’s idea. I put in the title that it’s her opinion not Yang’s
Why is that?
How much attention do you need. We can see your comments you already commented and got upvotes
Wow, we must have very different definition of "taking flight". Is -11.67% as I post. Dude, chill. Probably the first week of 2021 will continue shitting the bed and you can use your proceeds to buy even more shares. I truly believe this will rocket in 2021 and still has room to go down
You’re the biggest retard of us all. Take your fucking profits you dipshit. Even if you take 50,000 out and re-invest the other half, you’ve still secured 48,000 in profit and can play with the other 50.
Your sins are forgiven

Weirdo
Palantir really being kept in this downward trend eh?
I feel like we can still get 4 $20 call contracts or 420 contracts of whatever option chain prices at $4.20. That’s what Buffet would do.
Meaning?
Will absolutely buy more shares at or under $20
Bud you're getting mad in a meme sub. Think about that.

(ps people can be warehouse workers in an f500. Am I supposed to be impressed? (I've worked in several f100 but I don't drop that because what's the relevance?))
Alright, im in on ICLN leaps, lets go!
cool channel man, subbed
Just bought 50 contracts of JOE expiring in June. Not opening app until March. Can’t bring this ridiculous habit of checking RH every 10 minutes into 2021. Goodspeed you fucking retards!
TSLA $420 pre-split was a meme longer ago than that, and if dudes bought long-term calls at that price and diamond-handed them, they'd not need to worry about money the rest of their lives pretty much.

We make money and avoid anti trust issues 😚
I have no idea why I decided to die on this PLTR hill, but arrogance and ego are powerful diseases. With that said, I'm buying more🤮
Well I’ve lost 50%+ in the span of one week 🤡🤡. Guess it’s time to start over with a new strategy bc the only thing I’m doing good at now is losing money
Bowel movement pound?

So today would be a good day to buy call options because of all the red, right?
ACB any day now
anticipation of strong delivery numbers next week
If you're buying pltr at this price then you hate money.
Options are making weird moves
Making a comment so I can get an award

Big investors have to be getting pissed at this point wtf is going on

Where is your next 2k on?
This has got to be the most retarded thing I've seen all day
INO let’s go
Imagine being down 19k at 11am.
Bahahaha great story. I shit you not. Made 30k today on BN GO. 50,000 shares sold at the open.  Happy fucking new year!!   Did 3x on PLTR as well. Bought on day one.  Sold at $28.67, may dip back in on the dip.  Heyoooooo. 🚀 🚀 🚀 💎
It’s not taking flight though
Stimmy just hit yall, need to initiate the transfer now so I can buy more TSLA monday.
I wish everyone who asked this was banned for infinity days
...
If anybody wanna try cock for New Years dm me

It has been having some major pumps lately...not sure why
Same I had to take gains I’ve been on a losing streak so couldn’t risk it.
Low cap
Someone hold me and tell me B N G O is gonna double again today
Yep I read multiple sources say Jan 7th is D-day.
Good Lord it's going to be a bloodbath Monday.

I’ve never seen QQQ so flat in my life
NIO, PLTR, JMIA, LAZR are my bets for the "2021 Growth Stories". 

What do they have in common? Citron tweeted about all of them.
Glad I bought back in! Makes me feel better for selling at $1,500 pre-split and panic selling some when Elon said stock price was too high
Ahhhh I’m tracking. Yeah I missed one of my kids on the last one somehow. You thinking that’ll show up on taxes?
I'm gonna cut Andrew some slack and say it was all Carly's idea.
How am I supposed to buy more shares on the dip, if there are no more paper hands!? I want discount shares! Let me in!!!!

what happens to amzn stock if they split off aws?
You’re right I was looking at the wrong expiry but if I didn’t sell too early yesterday I could’ve profited about 15k. Sold 15 for $2 by accident forgot I had a limit sell and then sold my last 5 for $5 a piece.
can’t act like it doesn’t make me angry to see red, my monkey brain only understands color
someone just dropped two mil on nio 45c 1/8
Im sorry to hear that..:/ How much did you lose?
Ah, reverse psychology. I see what you did there. I'm retarded enough for this to work
never short tesla retard
And the best part is, had you sold earlier you’d be up more.

Have you seen those posts here from people saying “I was up this much, but I sold for much less?” Their story is the same as yours.

And the answer is renewable energy, ICLN / QCLN / PLUG / ENPH.

I got wrapped up in that STIC hype and sold for a loss. Probably money to be made but not anytime soon?   
Anyone have any word on my Thicc Boi? They slimmed him down a lot yesterday
watching PLTR gang become more and more desperate as their calls erode to nothingness does bring a smile to my face
Sucks bro. Hate that raw asshole feeling. Use baby wipes instead of toilet paper following each excretion. Don’t let the poop hot sauce sit on your anus for too long. Wipe immediately and often.
This fake AMZN pump got me this week!
Urgh.  Good luck. I am out of it fortunately.
I’m buying puts on FUBO in revenge.

2020 tryna rip my gains away. 2021 pls save me
OOH! that’s a b n g o!
They haven't announced their Covid related contracts aside from UK which should add to the 2021 revenue projections.

January/February should bring big things with Karps Covid interview, demo day and Q4 Earnings.
I'm in for more at 23.99 and then I'm going to attempt to not look at RH for a while.
WHY IS N. P.  A    A banned ticker here???
Thank you. I have been reading I just wasn’t sure if the price hits the strike and is exercised, who then gets paid for the shares. It makes sense I would Bc I own them but I was trying to be sure I did my dd with the fellow autists. Iv only bought calls and puts. And now have made enough to buy shares of stocks at 100 increments and wanted to sell calls being pltr is shitting the bed right now
I'm in GE leap's,  you might be trying to get retarded though
without a doubt
Imagine going on Reddit to downvote people after losing your life savings
INTC gang gang 🚀
Happy New Year to my fellow GMT+8 GANG LET’S GOOOO 🚀🎆
They’d have to win the contract again, unless the contract is specifically for proprietary Palantir services/products. So unless those contracts were sole sourced I would say them expiring is not really a good thing, it’s just a chance for them to lose work they had.
it still can
For Kobe
Yeah I’m going to look for a little peak next week to get out. Hopefully at least around the 135 range

Like it’s still rallying with it being at record highs, above pre pandemic high, PE of 70, new covid strain, and slow vaccine distribution. I’m guessing all the boomers buying the stock have passed from Covid and no sellers.

Should have held my positions to last day from earlier this week. Oh well still made money.
Because the market cap is still insane at this price.
Maybe my worst month ever actually
At which point will I accept that PLTR is a dead stock? It’s a great company but I think the stock has lost all momentum.
Why don't you guys award the thread and not the comments? That way this thread would make it to #1.
Yes, bet against the italian euro or the greek euro, riches await.

Thanks, but I’ve got nothing on the Autists that diamond hand deep OTM call options for astronomical gains.
I had that put then for Luckin but took very long, even after the fraud report, to crash. so the puts expired without value.

I hope it works out for you, I really do. I dont want to see anyone lose any money. Unfortunately all they keep signing is tiny crappy contracts. They need something big, and I hope they get something soon.

Do it a few more times and become a millionaire , but you have to all in.
It is.  Like td has a dne on my account.  If I fall asleep at 350, any itm long options I have will expire worthless.   They won't make an attempt to close them.   Someone, somewhere, will have their short call not assigned as a result.  If that's the only instance out of lets say 1000 open contracts, thats effectively zero, although non zero.
If the limit for the year is $6000 what happens to the contribution over that limit?
Bought the TSLA dip. Now to 715$ 🍆🍆💰💰🚀🚀🚀🚀
Anyone buying TSLA calls still is greedy asf and deserves to lose money

Stupid comparison.
That's what credit is for, take out that loan to make some $$$
I'd settle for, and maybe even prefer, an extended TSLA like squeeze over a large time frame than a VW infinity type squeeze. If GME successfully transitions to ecommerce the shorts will have to cover. I have no idea what time frame that will be but to assume that much buying pressure wont drive the price up is absurd. If GME fails to make the transition then I'm fucked but I see the first scenario as more likely.
Almost time for Netflix puts or wait until it’s closer to earnings?

He must be one of us, because that is the most retarded shit I have ever heard.
Yeah that’s the worst part...I was just doing it to defer having to pay until a later date so I wasn’t actually saving money in absolute terms anyways. I was trying to maintain liquidity considering the time value of what I would be paying which ultimately is minuscule in comparison to the potential losses on a long call following such a dramatic bump in the underlying.
I don't even invest I'm here for the memes
That’s the funniest shit ever

Commenting to say I was here
That is unbelievably impressive. WHAT A FLEX
Really regretting taking small 100% gains on this TSLA 700cs yesterday would’ve made 30k instead of 1k

Forgot I had a limit sell yesterday just above my cost for like 3/4 of them then sold the rest for 100% 

Gains are gains but damn  that one hurts
Chick fil a did what again?
Is 19 the new bottom for GME?

Yeah Robinhood will cause the financial crisis not the student loan debt cancellation. Interesting.
Sounds good, you should go all in friend.

He’d have to sell them then. If you use robinhood for example, if you have a call in the money at expiration they sell it for you an hour before close.
Looks like you got the 9/11: Twin towers going down.

Relax charles. Just shitposting.
NIO ‼️‼️‼️‼️
Oh right right. But you can still "save" cap gain losses, right? So I could write off 3k against my 2020 income, and save the rest of the 17k loss to be assessed against my eventual 2021 cap gains. (Assuming they still exist by then). 

And yes, I know I should be asking my accountant, which I will, but I figure you guys probably have good insight into how to best tax harvest year end losses.
Obviously you get the strike price you set for the covered call, so for each contract you sold you'll get paid 100 x strike price but you will lose 100 shares.  So you will have made the following;

premium + (100 \* strike price of contract)

That's the only risk of covered calls, you essentially cap your potential gains to whatever you set the strike price to + the premium, if a stock shoots up way past your strike price you loose out on those potential gains.

If you didn't already know this I'd say you should probably spend some more time reading up on options and trading so you don't end up screwing yourself.
MU 90C is on the table again. Old fugs should rally on this. Where's Marty???

Omfg this shitty comp again. Tldr don't buy this garbage
not sure, haven't been tracking GILD flow.

Jan 15 is a major options expirations date in the new tax year so best guess: a ton of covered calls from when GILD stock price was much higher and lotto tickets.

consolidation edit: No way. I might buy some March 70s and dump them if profitable before earnings in Feb but likely won't put any money in GILD.
I thought I got a pretty good deal, flipping TSLA 1DTE 700c yesterday for a 100% gain
Worked there for four years and you really have no idea. Would strongly consider staying in pltr
Lmao Tesla
SHIT SHIT SHIT!!!
I'm not such a good investor when the random TSLA shares I fomo'd into last year are the best part of my current portfolio. Although I have some 100%+ gains on other stocks I didn't buy a lot of shares.
It's OK to be poor.

Real question. Why is GME going to skyrocket?
and wat does tesla have?
That's why you keep on rolling your options down and out brah.
Down 18% overall. Started in July even though I really wanted to get in in March/April when everything crashed but like all my plays, my timing is shit. 

I learned not to 📄🤚🏼 like a little bitch. Missed out on a 10 bagger on xpev 40c 12/18 because I sold on an early morning dip in early November.

That’s called marrying an influencer
The day Elon announces SpaceX going public, TSLA will make many cry.
NOW IT DOESNT TURN ON!!
RIGHT?! Fuck this shit stock. If PLTR is not up 14% by Monday noon I will take the loss and go all in on NIO to hold for a year or two and never look back
Look! It’s the guy who didn’t buy Tesla at the dip today!!

I would be more worried about GME than PLTR, PLTR  has government backing and IP (intellectual property). Their proprietary technology and strategic placement means they aren’t going anywhere. I wanna say it is just a temporary hiccup, however smart traders know how to make money on the up and on the down.
To compare Palantir to Enron is the most absurd thing i've witnessed on this sub.

GTFO
Sure, agreed
Yassss baby
PLTR needs to crack $24 for me
today is the type of day where the second you buy something it trades the opposite way no matter what
With this logic where’s my AAPL earnings run up 

My calls are just getting theta fucked 😍
YOU ARE NOW IN A MARGIN CALL. TAKE ACTION IMMEDIATELY.
I might get back into pltr instead. Looks like a good spot to buy.  Monthly chart looks sexy.  New ath’s after this dip
Absolute degens 😆
Its okay to sell Palantir. It's not "paper handing". Reassess the thesis. Palantir has no way to scale. It is overvalued. Cut your loss and find something else. 

Ask yourself, do you even know why did you decided to buy Palantir in the first place or did you just play follow the leader. 

1. this is a consulting company not a SAAS, it cannot grow as fast as you hoping it to grow
2. it's already overvalued at 50 billion with projected revenue of 1 billion in 2020

GME at least has a strong thesis. Palantir has nothing besides name recognition of Peter Thiel.
Tesla a goon 👏
what about disney makes you think they are getting smaller? lmao don't bet against the mouse

Up 22% for the year, up over 100% from March lows. 

Biggest takeaways:
1) inverse wsb 
2) naming your company rocket doesnt mean 🚀🚀🚀
3) no matter what, dont sell covered calls for a strike lower than your cost basis.  Because that one random surprised buyout will fuck you so hard.
4) don't hedge. Fuck VXX calls.  Fuck them all

I totally feel that. I've been holding a pretty safe position, but still was a nervous wreck this week because I reallllly didn't want to realize anything until next year but would have hated to lose it all as well. Sorry to hear it didn't work out for ya :(
Are you sure
?????
Up $10k playing options. I was up $30k but then September happened. Oh well, a new year starts tomorrow.
I’m up like 109% YTD. I only had like two real conviction trades, the first was being long Uber during the massive sell off that resulted in a like 50% drawdown, and the second was going all in with what was left on Square around $40 per share. I sold square around $165-185 and went long PSTH for $23.57/share and continue to hold that
Because you have pretty much no control over how things will move and pretty much no information to make decisions on.

Think of how the Trump tweets or things like that randomly influence the market and then it's just like that every second of every day.
TSLA😂
Earnings were bad, like always. But you shouldn’t underestimate the run up to earnings

My wife joked about buying a 1000c for next year and I told her that probably wasn't a good idea. I might have been wrong.
You need to spell her name correctly for her to listen
Nice man.
Suggest looking up tax brackets first as it's taxed as ordinary income. Most people probably won't even move into the next tax bracket for it to make a huge difference holding into the new year
that's not how any of this works
So, NIO is supposed to release the 150KW battery on Nio day (Jan 9).  It's range is 900km or 559mi.

Isn't TSLA's longest range battery only 400mi?
Will rip on dem sweep but I’m not planning to hold thru that. I think people will pile in ahead of the runoff, I’d sell before results
How high guys ? 715-720?
BLOODY RED
I had 30 bucks of buying power available in my account the other day so I bought a NIO EOYWD FD call and it printed so hard this morning. I'm never doubting my "Zoib-y wanna buy on margin!" instinct again, but I'm happy with the vacuum I just bought 😎

Um what? It wouldn't be 12 months if he bought it in March 2019 or May 2019. Last I checked, a holding period of 8 months and 9 months are, indeed, less than 12 months. I'm lost for words.
I agree.  Dogsled racing must be booming this time of year?

Joking aside, we can't do sub 1 billion here for fear of being accused of market manipulation.

You’ll be fine. I sold a 760C. Even if deliveries isn’t a sell the news event, I don’t think we go that high. If we do - then I’m happy with the profit.
Down 20% in taxable, up about 45% in Roth. Basically 4-5 outsized bad trades outweighed huge gains from March.

Use a target fund set and forget. Do meme stuff in a personal account. The meme stuff kind of makes sense then since you are de risked with the conservative target fund and the meme will print to compensate for boomer-esque 6% gains in the 401k.

For the most part, yes.  I may sell some put credit spreads against it if it has several bad days.  I want to sell covered calls into some sort of upward momentum so premium is high and I can go far OTM.

Pltr pleas
Because he bought in May 2019, he can't hold it long enough to achieve a long term capital gain. You are correct that he could use a wash sale to buy another option and stretch it out until May 2020. I would highly recommend this strategy.
Its not topped yet godspeed
Here’s something that helps with bad days, just think about if you were you’re old self and you could see yourself now, how proud you would be. I mean if it’s worse now than idk fuck you. But for those bullish on life, every day is a good day when you’re learning something🙂

I am actually starting to worry about the 1/8/21 TSLA $750 covered call I sold.  I think I might actually have to buy this back.  I thought I sold it so far out of the money, with such a short expiration, there was no way the strike would get hit.  I don't know whether to laugh or cry.

Bout to sell my TSLA and go buy me either a BMW M4 or Tesla this week. I cant decide.
Said I wasnt gonna listen to WSB again so fuck that. If PLTR is not up more than 14% within Monday noon I will just go all in on NIO and hold for a year or something and not look back
ARK just paid out dividends.  Fat ones.
OMG PSTH going orbital
Yea, there wouldn’t be any weirdness. And yes, legging in and legging out of a short call can definitely help improve profitability, especially if you’re right about a stock beginning a consolidation phase.

so how do you figure netflix is valued? DIS is a streaming service and production company first now - also the biggest production comapny in the world. they will become the biggest streaming comany in the world as well with ESPN and HULU alone if they can grab the sports market which is growling to be mostly shitty illegal streams. also, most of their subscribers at the moment don't have children. imagine when the families start buying it just to watch the new star wars/marvel/pixar movies to keep the rugrats happy... and ya, they were also a blue chip stock when all they had was theme parks. those opening again with the vaccine is just a bonus now. try and use that head rather than just jumping on memes

Tfw 20k in realized losses for 2020, but 40k in unrealized profit heading into 2021.🤑🤑🤑 

If I understand this correctly, that would mean I get to write off my 20k loss for my 2020 tax returns while I essentially get a full year to use the 40k in profits however I want before the tax man eventually gets to it in 2022. Right?

I do a cheap daily buy of AAPL whenever it’s not close to 52wk high. That’s on stop of my 401k contribution which I max annually and an IRA
Hope this is the bottom. 50% of my calls worth is wiped out. I yoloed my entire port into PLTR at mon open. Regret it v much

Real talk here. PLTR will probably gonna go down in the next month. But I'm holding until it reaches 135+/share, which it will. Don't fall for this FUD shit. It happens all the time. PLTR is literally skynet. It will take over the world. Accumulate all dips.
Holding shares of PLTR at $26. Double down at $24?
Got a RIOT call $12 expiring in March. But feel like I should just sell now. Profit is profit.

38B, lol.  Think of how much GME they missed out on buying.
Yeah thats why I usually use debit spreads to open. I just didn’t know if there’s any weirdness that comes along when you open each leg individually.

Now that I think about it, if you expect a directional move in the near future and then expect the stock to remain relatively stable or not increase too much approaching expiry...it’s a much better play to use a long call into the directional move and then turn it into a debit spread after. That way you can pick whatever strike makes the most sense for your short call after seeing how much the underlying has moved.

I’ve just been using debit spreads from the outset until now.

Pleas
Thanks for the advice, 

Long story short; glad I called, it is best to NEVER assume. 

Two takeaways:
- Although the purchase was a cash type transaction, the securities are held in margin in order to allow me to borrow against them. Note that no interest is accrued. Their language on the app is not necessarily the friendliest, hence the confusion. 
- With Fidelity investment accounts, you have to manually opt-in to allow them to lend your shares for purposes like short selling. 

Hope this helps others, thanks again to the GME gang for the knowledge and support.

Of all the stocks you could pick to jump into right now, TSLA is the one. LOL
I know what they do. But the reason I bought was because of the huge pump on this sub. I believe way more in NIO and actuamly think they will do good. Should have just stayed with that. Would have been up like 20% and more if you account for my loss on PLTR

1. Alibaba agrees to drop "choose 1 of 2" rule after consulting with anti-trust regulators.
2. ANT agrees to become holding firm, timeline set for compliance/IPO.

Every index bout to go green, let’s end 2020 on right note, Ozon 🇷🇺

People selling for fear that McConnell just lost the senate by fucking over America on the $2k Stimmy. Georgia may go blue. Which would allow the new administration to push through new regulation taxing all gains in the new year like income.

TSLA don't give a fuck
Yeah it’s not a stock to go all in lol
Look we are all the same, everyone wants to make money.  They just want to make it a lot slower than the rest of us.
We're watching a cyclical rotation (right now). Gains being taken on growth played into value. Could be only through EOY on profit/loss netting, could continue next year.

Vaccine optimism means that people are thinking the normal economy will sorta resume and you don't need to be buying crap for 2030 valuation when 2022 could be ok.

That said, godspeed and 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀. I wish you only success, though you did ask for potential downsides.

Baba back to 212 lol
There is no reason for anything anywhere anytime anymore in this market. Ever. 🤷‍♂️
Oh
If your short call is more OTM than your long call, then all your doing is capping your maximum gains while pocketing premium. 

At the same time, you also reduce the affect of theta and vega on your position, since it’s being offset by a short leg that is one strike over.

Ok PLTR you can moon now 😂😂😂

Lmk why I sold my Tesla 700c for a loss on Tuesday, 2020 got to hurry up
amen.
You mean after maxing out 401k?
I bought another 10 shares today, got 100 so far. I do think it’s overvalued right now, but I would just buy a few shares every time it dips more than 5%. This is a long term play (5-10 years), so shares are probably the play. ARKG might be better if you want to diversify.

I’ll admit it, AAPL $135 FDs at open seemed like a good idea at the time.

I regret that decision.
PLTR is getting way more mentions than GME so far in December, GME is still up there though.
I just use my profits to buy stonks especially those with dividends and just forget about it
I’m not fcking selling!!!!!! TSLA 12/31 FD’s FTW 710 EOD BIG 🍆🍆
Yea poor guy
Bidu 225 FDs now
When does market close today?
If you want a cheap GME squeeze bet (that is, if you're not already bag holding):

GME April 20c/35c debit call spread is fairly cheap at about 2.7 to 2.8

Premiums on the 20c are fairly pricey at ~$5 a pop, but that's mitigated a bit by selling the much further OTM $35c which is still going for around $2+ which is pretty insane imo as GME will have to squeeze beyond $37 for those calls to work out.

Width between the two is 15 pts so even if this does move beyond the $35 strike at least your max gain is fairly decent for an entry of $2.8 (5 bagger if it actually hits).

If after ER GME only manages to retake $22 then you'll be near break even at least, esp with GME IV. Course the spread can just get trashed completely, but selling those overpriced (imo) $35c will help a lil against theta and IV crush.

The $40c also goes for some ridiculous value as well, but the liquidity is low and bid/ask spread is far so those of you on RH will probably get a shit fill and end up being red on both legs of the spread like a tool.
[deleted]
You are welcome, $300 was a big wall to break down through, next support should be at 250
Maybe he meant put/call
Rolling is just buying back a contract and selling another one. Vanguard doesn't let you buy to close a short contract? Thats fucked.

But I was dead long before yesterday ....
Is there anything strange to look out for legging into debit spreads like that? Never done that before and a little disconcerting seeing a short call just sitting by itself alone lol
What the fuck is wrong with PLTR? Its literally shitting itself lately and I fucking hate it because I pulled out of NIO to put into PLTR. If nothing changes I am just gonna take the loss and put into NIO again because I actually believe in that company. Never listening to retards on WSB again. NIO to $55 January 5th
at this rate tesla will be back to 1000$ by end of next years.  

when will people learn.  blowing ur acct buying  PLTR 30C 12/31   🤡🤡.  lol.

I suppose someone might not want their money... best to close them if you want to keep your shares.
I work as a client adviser for a major bank. Maybe I am just extrapolating too much though. At least that's what I see.
This is the dip nobody should miss out on.

Imagine being so late to the party that you are still talking about PLTR and GME.
Or it closes at 694.20
I have it was insanely useful but pretty difficult to learn.
695
TTD options are more expensive than TSLA and doesn’t have the volatility.

TTD was the play in March - buy 100 shares and sell <30DTE OTM CALLS at 10% ROI
It dipped to 693 within like the last hour lmao

Once upon a time there was this fairy who waved a wand and ‘poof’ a company called Enron was built out of the dust, sweat and tears and then shedded the blood of many.  But history never repeats because we are intelligent creatures.

Edit. Geez relax folks. It was just a shitpost.
Mostly everything is red today
2021 will be the year of selling covered calls and buying stupid shit with the profits
My prediction for pltr in 2021: mid year 48 eoy 73
Strategically down 25% this year with positions that are gonna fucking POP in January. 

BBBY, DIS, PLTR, STLD, and TLRY call spreads all with exp in January, Feb, and March.

tldr; im retarded
Also, nice
Red but feeling bullish
Your mistake was ever buying puts in the first place  🚀  🚀  🚀
Stonks only go up. I learned my lesson buying puts lost 24k
AAPL the type of company to deep throat Marlon Brando for a small bump to their stock price

Nothing but shares for this slow POS.
Why will it have a record inflow?
F brodur
Why? The Canadian pot stocks weren’t profitable and had horrible execution. The US market was built to avoid all of the Canadian failures. Oh well, I mean I can’t convince you otherwise, I’m sure because there’s MANY people who think like you, because it happened there, same will happen here. Just check the charts, these companies are already executing, and the laws haven’t even made it easy for them,....yet. This is one of those trades everyone says “why didn’t I see that?” A year from now. Good luck and Happy New Year!
Have you sold? Can you draw me up some puts a year out please?
everyday is a new bottom 🥲
Count on your shares being taken
It’s not going to finish above $700.  They will hold it under....guaranteed
wow nice call there but RetardConsensus. Buy high, hold for the decline, then sell before it goes back up.

Write down every play you think is a great deal.

Nah, he'll keep pumping it. My change jar has more value than the shares....
Thanks. So if Im checking my stuff daily what timeframe for the MA would you recommend, or rather which timeframe do you find the most successful overall? I dont day trade and have no intention to so if a longer term MA is generally more reliable that would be great because I could stop being obsessive and staring at tiny fluctuations while doing nothing.
Fellas I'm gonna buy today the last dip

I'm happy.. cause i could technically cash out my BA LEAPS now.. but prob wait till next week.
Anyone know what’s the futu catalyst?
Because I started thinking the credit from adding a short may be qualified as “realized gain” like an absolute dumbass and then by the time I realized how stupid that was, it was already down. Really should just do that now anyways
lol fuck that, atleast at restaurants you could pick over the plates before they hit the dumpster

Just started investing this year, played around with a dividend portfolio until a few months back.
Big spike is from PLTR, I realized some of the profits. Still holding 20 shares and a LEAPS. Little dip at the end is from playing SPY calls :( also have various small positions in XOM, ARKG, and a few others. 150% ain’t too shabby for my first year though
PLTR back to 30 by 1/29 EZ

ENPH has been pumping all year, and was being hyped for a good portion of 2019 as they ramped to profitability. I don't know what to tell you fam, but I've been confused as shit by how quiet this sub has been on both ENPH and SEDG.

Real talk, as early as the beginning of November ENPH was still barely $100. And Biden has yet to even officially step into office yet. This year is not going to fuck around regarding solar.

Blew up my account & went from 2k -> 23 dollars in 2019 & stopped trading for a year. Decided to try it again & put in another 2.4k in Oct 2020 & made 9k riding various meme stonks (PLTR, NIO, SPCE, BA)

Biggest regret was selling my DIS calls the day before the mega pump. Couldve made around 30k or so if I held another day, but still a pretty good trading year nonetheless.
Only 13%

Moral of the story, when you need to sell just fucking sell. You’re gonna lose more holding than you will on taxes

Was up 17% now I’m down $1k to finish the year 😊
Just made 60% on a banned ticker because it pump and dumped

Damn good end to the year
Anyone awarding this post is shorting GME indirectly. Calls only, no awards! Bears might have infiltrated us.
OP’s is a gay retard
Theta gang gang! Premiums must be delicious
Buy ARKK and ARKG dip?
How much should I buy? Will it keep going down errrr
Possibly CRM calls. Waiting for below $221.
You’re so fucking annoying, you know that?
At least Nio stays strong
QS volatility must still be expanding... i sold Jan 15 45 puts and they've barely budged despite small rally. That's nuts.. those things are so far OTM they should be cut in half with a dollar move..

So that’s why most people that use Robinhood have cracked screens
When you're a day too early on the puts and miss out on hundreds but have enough to make it all back 😑😒
CRSR gonna run up like crazy next year but the question is when?
There is non-dead stocks that pay dividends though it’s meaningless to just pick companies that are struggling, there’s plenty of vanguard ETFS that pay ~2% and have lots of growth potential stocks included in them
Personally, I think Redfin is fucked too. I can easily match their listing fee if I want to but don’t have to yet since their agents aren’t very good...  I just got a half a percent higher and steal their business all the time
AAPL put the shovel down 😓
Up 35 % for the year (of down from my highs of 105% and 73% respectively from holding spy puts and gild calls for too long). Still a great year! I may stop doing options next year, I made significantly more from selling stocks. Best gain came from QS (which I bought at 35 and sold at 100). Overall great year! I am ready or a few years of a biotech bubble.
Look at this! We've got a fucking Edgar Allan Dickens here at WSB!!!
RC should give even the normally weakest of 🙌 some 🥌🏔💎 strength.  🚀📈
Do you use QC for all of this? 

I really like how easy it is to get into but once you start digging into the details and trying to do custom implementations it just becomes unmanageable. Especially since a lot of functionality is black-boxy. It seems they sacrificed approachability for depth. Trying to create any sort of complex position sizing or money management model is near impossible in my experience.
Yikes
Its because they only buy fd's
You guys are sleeping on DIS 
The Mouse will have retard strength in 2021. Smart money getting in now before retail fomo’s in at $300

Might swing by, I’ll let you know
this is literally the most dumb fuck thing i have ever seent. ANYWAYS IM IN!!!!!!! WHATS THE TICKER ON COINS 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 LETS MOON THIS SHIT
When did you buy?
Yeah praying man. I bought at like 53ish. Did nothing but bleed since I bought. 

There was one day I could have sold for break even but I figured the amount I put up required a little patience and then it fucked me

ever read comments here and expect to open your account and see how fucked you are, only to realize too many people overreact bc of a 1% dip. get a grip you paper hands
Bought the AMD dip again

IDK what the fuck is wrong with me. Been hurt so many god damn times the last two weeks thinking it was going to push all the way back to $93+....
The guy who played ARKG murdered his room mate with a sword. All in!
Remember when 2-3 weeks ago all the $18 bag holders were worried and about to cut losses after q3 earnings. We since shot back up to almost $23 at the highs and holding around $19 currently. Just be patient. This is why people on here say to own shares instead of options. It’s definitely a ride but more tailwinds are coming in 2021. 

Position: 2,810 shares @ $6.90
Can I do a line off of your long PLTR?

👍 still the right approach to zero days. Win some lose some.
I mean, yeah i don't care about the candles but for me: it's approaching oversold, it's also approaching a key level from a gap up a long time ago. Don't be surprised if it fills though.. gaps have a nasty habit of attracting the price.. They do say gaps always fill eventually.

Hey dad, it’s me, your son.
So here is my anecdote: I had a trip planned March 23, 2020 that (obviously) got cancelled. The airlines and travel agency gave us vouchers to use within 2 years. We had originally moved it to March 2021, but recently got an email saying they were not even booking trips until summer 2021, and so now its not happening until March 2022.

Moral of the story here, large scale leisure travel is not going to recover until 2022 and even then, a lot of people have already paid for their tickets/accommodations so that will not be pure profit.
Wheres Marty? MU is going for it !!!

Ye
Game was rigged from the start
But when is the best time to sell GME shares op? When do I need to be attentive and cash on for my tendies money?
Houston agent here. Honestly the zestimates and Zillow is still far behind a good agent knowing their marketplace for which they work. All these bigger tech real estate firms are doing is flushing out the shitty part time agents which we all hate anyway. So if you’re coming in this organized, with a routine, checklist and making it your daily mission to understand the market for which you work you will excel.

Also open door is gonna get whacked... their business model isn’t sustainable in my opinion and I’ve seen them make offers on some whack ass homes that would never sell for a profit on their end.
Lmao stocks are retarded sometimes

Always how it works. For me when i hedge by shorting something seemingly overvalued. The beta's know i shorted and flip around.. so on a red day, my shorts which are supposed to protect me, end up being green and my longs of course end up being red..

Rotation to boomer stocks. Utilities, banks, consumer goods, entertainment. Rejection  of tech.
You got that mixed up.  If they have cash from gains they’re not avoiding taxes by entering new positions.  Some might not sell today to avoid closing in the year but more likely is lots of sales to lock in losses for tax credits.
I’m jacked to the fucking tits
Keep it on your watchlist might be some resistance around 24-26$ level.

If you think Palantir is on sale now. Wait for the bigger sale next week. Guaranteed. This will probably not go below 23.5 today but just you wait for next week.

This company is way overvalued and has no way to scale. Institutions don't care about your meme. They see the writing on the wall.
Last time Cohen tweeted about $GME he was increasing his position and thumbing his nose at The Street... Similar tweet today (he rarely tweets). I don't have much of a position but will be interested to see if hindsight is similar

If you missed the ARKG and ARKK dips,  now is your chance to buy in.

End of year profit taking it causing everything to be on sale today.
That must be why you're an expert in telling cool stories. Cool story breh.
To be fair, I’m comparing Canoo to NIO and TSLA because they are marketing this product to consumers. You need to compare Canoo to the industry leaders because that’s what investment companies are doing. They are asking the hard questions like “what do you offer to consumers that your competitors cannot? And why do you think your company will compete well with others in the sector?” Right now the answers aren’t very resounding. Canoo needs a whale to support this company but they aren’t getting it, hence the current share price. 

Workhorse is another competitor in the company delivery system niche. They are also looking at potentially adding a USPS contract in the next quarter. ARK is invested in WKHS at the moment. Why not Canoo?

I would like to think retail investors like their product, but it doesn’t seem to have the backing. There’s only so much you can blame on the MMs. 

I believe this can pop up to $25 but it depends on the EV environment next year. Investors are already shifting their capital to recovery stocks (look up market rotation). 

You guys can downvote me, but it’s important to understand both sides of the bearish/bullish sentiments. Until there is a positive catalyst this will trade sideways like FSR.
Am I wrong here, or aren't people going to buy positions today to avoid capital gains tax, then dump after first of the year to loosen up cash???
wow i fell for the same trick twice
If I had to pick one company to buy out of the two I would buy HEAR.  Even though I like CRSR’s products better.  There just isn’t a big enough market to justify the market cap.

GME guy holds through the march crash and earnings disaster meanwhile I'm fumbling a leap 😞
Imagine getting an award
GME $19 C, 1/29 🚀
Remember to buy the PLTR dip boys!

And the one at $20!

And the one at $14 too!
ROPE party at my house. Who s in
The awards show how successful we are by buying these options
BULLS HOLD THE LINE 💎🙌😤🐂🦬🐃
What if you already did that?
\-50% in 6 days. Pretty impressive. I got suckered too.
Riot jesus
Long calls, long leaps, long debit spreads, short puts.  Let’s go 🚀
What's that
>	For Canada, the last day for tax-loss selling in 2020 is December 29. Stocks purchased or sold after this date will be settled in 2021, so any capital gains or losses will apply to the 2021 tax year. The system differs in the US, and based on information from the IRS, the last day for tax-loss selling this year is December 31.

market has been very meh for the past 2 weeks. Even though dow has slowly grinded higher, memes have stalled out or just gone red(PLTR...)
Okay Market, final answer. Survey says..! GUH
I got Jan 15 and feb 19 exp
Ok bud
Let’s go!
What movie is this ?
My favorite rotation...rotation out of my portfolio...
693.17% as of a few moments ago in my yolo account. Started with 10k around May, just was doing random equity. Then actually started doing options in September. Rode the Nio and PLTR train up to a tippy top of 97K, back down to 87K right after I exited from PLTR and have taken some red so far but am sitting in a 40K/47K split of ark funds and leaps.

I try to pretend I dont have a TSP(401K) account and just try to throw as much money as I can at that. IDK what it is even up to this year but I surmise 30+% since it follows SP500 closely.
He’s in the office of president elect though LOL
Same.  Every time I wait until at least 10-10:30 always works out better.  Stupid brain keeps wanting to chase gains instead of waiting for the pullback.
GET ON THE WISH TRAIN BEFORE ITS TOO LATE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Ugh NIO hitting 50 then drilling YOU WERE DOING SO WELL
Buy high sell low
Earning 2/9. Hold till then.
amd wtf are you even doing right now?
Just buy pltr calls every morning around 10:20
evidence or BAN
I agree with your rebuttal all I'm saying is time will tell if this inflated valuation is justified.
You see TSLA you GME people what a short squeeze looks like and how much you need to go your way
Just bought x150 Jan 15 $40 GME calls. Let’s see what happens for fun
... same.

what did you expect.. its business model is just a different take on leasing.   And its not that innovative,  I believe Volvo has already tried.
Profit is profit.  Some people hold shit all year for 6%. Onwards and upwards.  You got this.
Below $300 as we speak.
These are all very obvious guesses. Didn’t take much work to throw these thoughts together and non of them will come to fruition in 2021. Pure idiocy and a very modern approach, very click baity words, hyperbole, and pure dog shit.
INTC has been flat for the past two years, it’s pretty sad

Guys, the legendary TSLA 3500C has finally printed in pre-split terms. I miss the days of buying that because it was all I could afford lol

For the millionth time, anyone bullish here belongs in /r/investing. This is a gambling subreddit. On June 11th, September 3rd, and a few other times I got 50 baggers on puts. Green days are NEVER as green as red days are red. I buy calls and puts, but I always regret the calls to be honest.
NIO back up 🚀
I sold NIO at the tippy top

so tippy top that the line doesn't even show on the chart where I sold.
Yep

your wife’s boyfriend gonna be pissed
Pltr bounces off perfectly at the 0.618 fib level, dunno why y’all selling for? Isn’t it the perfect dip to buy???
Ye good plan
I just realized we're not just fighting the shorts and Melvin Capital, theta gang is also attacking us
PLTR is evil like Facebook

If you’re in a bad option, maybe cash this one out while it’s green and reposition yourself on a farther out play if there’s any small dips
WISH!!!! 10%+ BY EOD

Aapl why do u gotta go breakin my heart like this
NIO dip is over.  Time to fly.
I mean I didn’t go to school and used udemy for certificates and I’m nearly in the 6 figures after 2 years
for sure that's a great entry point for shares
Thoughts on PLTR 24c 1/15? I’m up 4% only
My New Years resolution is for GME to squoze
Don't think so.
Selling some things so I can have cash on hand. getting ready to buy more ARKG options when it drops below 90
INTC finna fly again

Someone please tell me why ppl keep buying zm. Thx

Yeah you mean like the price appreciation on dividend juggernauts like Exxon Mobile, AT&T, GE, and Ford to name a few?
Stock prices dont need a catalyst to go up or down.

Edit: it is now down roughly 20% from last week with no news or catalyst

This cock sucker fucking market is 2018 all over again.

At 10:20am?
On a bunch of bullish headlines about 2021 growth potential, leading into an earnings run up coming out of a supercycle holiday season where 9/10 phones gifted were iPhones? I expect them not to be down 3.5% since December 29th open. But like I said, I'm holding regardless.

buying the dip works 100% until you run out of funds and the dipping continues.
/r/yourjokebutworse
Yep, same here.

I had a great 2020 and made a big bet a week ago when it was ~ $52 on a lot of 60c 2/19. Feeling mega fucked as I watch a lot of gains go to shit real fast.

I've been following DKNG for several months and made some money here and there. This 5 days and counting sell-off is unusual even for DKNG price action. Seems more unlucky than anything.

I think it will run the next month and a half but I was counting on the low-mid 50s to be the starting point for the run up. Gone from needing about 20% movement to make a profit to like 40%.

I mentioned in another comment that FUBO tanking may be dragging other sports betting stocks with it -- or it's just an industry wide consolidation.

If New York can pass a bill legalizing sportsbetting I think it launches back up to the mid 50s.
From your mouth to Allah's ears.
I have a hunch that AAPL is going to underperform the market today.

Worthless company, likely bankrupt in a couple years anyway.
Well, all out of 7 of yours are closed.

An actual BATTLE is being fought for GME right now
Waiting until EOD to buy in. Decisions Decisions
Yeah my bad, I gave the number pre-2021 gains which btw are a given.
Well given that Netflix is worth over $200B the extra $150B for all that shit seems warranted lol

Hey man I first bought in the last spike at 19 before it dropped to 12, you know what I did? I average down now my cost basis is 15.6 and I'm up so in due time trust and have confidence in what made you initially want to invest in the first place

Just lowering our tax burdens for the year. This is the way
Tesla is such a magnificent company, so much fucking upside from here, Semi, Cybertruck, solar, mega packs for wind energy projects, fucking HVAC, 25k car in the works for poors. this bull rally is just getting started. 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Trying to find shit undervalued or even at value is impossible rn
You been drinking? License and registration please.
yes call ambulance
Definitely puppies.  They are just so cute! 🥰
Absolutely. However since the key states won’t legalize online sports betting until at least february-march it’s going to just trade flat and be volatile for no reason. You can likely get a better entry by waiting for more drops. Look at it’s historic movement, it rallies one day, falls the next etc.
My 2021 resolution is to get flexible enough to lick my own asshole so I can taste Jeff’s dong after he fucks me
Only one out of their 7 are closed...
Got some lotto SCHWEED calls in case of a pump but nothing crazy more of just an end of the year gamble
Wow, TSLA has saved my fucking ass so many times this year and I don't even have options on it half the time.   


Stonk. 100 shares at $280 and I didn't even buy in fucking early...

So now that so many of us have gold from this — should we spread the gospel of GME to r/lounge for gold members?

You have Johnson & Johnson reporting their vaccine study results in the next couple of weeks.  That may cause MRNA to drop more.  The J&J vaccine is a single shot vaccine.  MRNA will also announce in the next week or two if their current vaccine is effective against the UK and South Africa variants.  I'm waiting another week or two before going bullish.  But I'm mentally challenged.
I have 1/15c not shares, gonna switch to selling CSPs for a lower entry into shares after I’m out of this

If you own BLNK, do yourself a favor sell and buy a better EV. Peep my DD. It’s a Ponzi scheme gentleman
Net $$ invested worth pre March crash: 600k
After crash: 400k
Currently: 1.1m

+50k for the year in play money(60k start) with MANY plays in shares. Best was +8k in LMND.

The bulk is in 5k(split adjusted) looooong shares of AAPL and a 401k that I’m about to start trading myself.

This shit is just getting started for me, but I will say that my money has tanked a bit since paying attention to this retarded sub...
The scientists gathered around the table excitedly whispering in hushed tones.

"Sir, we may have finally discovered a specimen which defies the Universal Principle!"

"You see, sir, we previously thought that stonks only go up."

The scientists watched in stunned silence as PLTR only went down, eagerly pursuing its own self-annihilation.

The Universal Principle, as constant as the law of gravity, had been debunked as casually as swatting a fly.

Amidst the excitement of their discovery, a creeping feeling of dread began to settle in their stomachs.
Last day to sell for tax loss was 12/29, don’t just dump positions today, you’re too late.
I cannot look at it, how is it looking? Tell me without saying the numbers
I’m holding W T R H because I think I’ll make bank, but fuck I keep losing tendies
Lubeless
For stocks...yes. I will use moving averages as a basis for the stop-loss order.  

For options...no. I would never use a stop-loss order. You won't be happy with the fill.

Super gay end to a super gay year
I get the vibe that we will never actually see an Apple car, and that Mr Apple only announced that to cash in on the EV hype. Then when that dies down he can say it wasnt a viable revenue stream for the company. The stock reaps the benefits and he never even had to make a fake prototype like nkla. Kinda similar to how they handled Apple Glass.

I had TAP Jan 47.5 calls bought in September I couldn’t sell at market because they were no bids even for .01, that I ended up making about 30% on.  Bought at 1.2 went to actual 0 and sold at 1.5ish.

PLTR is like a fucking limbo champion. I would be impressed if I wasn’t so fucking *de*pressed.
If you are a true sociopath you can make money doing it. Same with any sort of sales really. Just sell false hope and prey and on their weaknesses.

Well, you see...


I've done a lot of market research, and I mean A LOT. And the reality is PLTR is poised to take off! This was deduced using a complex algorithm of my own creation, with the help of 6 cans of redbull and a handful of whippets.


Here's how I figured it out:
PLTR, you have to restructure everything you think you thought you thunk you might have known and flip it on its head. Or flip it on its tail to be more accurate.

Yeah, i love it. Finally these cocksucking meme stocks coming back down to Earth. Lets just hope they don't burn up upon re-entry.
In theory but IV crush absolutely obliterates ATM and ITM calls. it fucking sucks holding leaps but they do pay well when prices actually fucking moves.

Past month, honestly
Yeah manage all my shit but typically just index funds.   Spy and qqq.  Set and forget.   I do options too but try mainly to stick to selling puts.   Calls just piss away retirement money.    Key is monthly contributions so that its deposited before u see it.   I tool out 15k penalty free to buy a rental condo.  Was super easy.   Roth is Good $ for emergency fund bc of no penalty

yes they did - just checked. maybe that AAPL leap will work out.
I went from -90% to +1000% on TSLA calls after that S&P announcement
Why do I keep buying PLTR shares and leaps? Am I really part of WSB now? 🤡🚀😊

Lmao SPY this past week looks disgusting
If you’re a put holder you have popcorn. I’m a firm believer that PLTR will be back on the uptrend early in the new year, though.
I really hope you sold some.  It was your life time chance with 2000% profit.
Sold my PLTR calls. Which means it'll be mooning right now
Not FUCK YOU PLTR, it's THANK YOU PLTR for putting shares on SALE. Back up the truck.

I'm long 1400@10.80

Still think we end the day $135 but man what a rough morning

This is a non-stop horror show

Feel like that prediction was made as a joke. 

All of the predictions are so pie in the sky.
Just because the float grows, doesn't mean all those shares are available shares on the market to buy. It will dip, but probably not as much as people think as institutions buy up what is sold on the market after the lockup.

You'll be fine. 76% seems like a lot, but you can recover that $3,800 quickly. 

Just don't lose 76% when your account is 6 or 7 figures.
Is this a record for most awards on a post? How do I get a call option on u/Youkiame . Their value is going to the moon.
Damn thank the lords of the northern regions that I sold all my PLTR positions that weren’t shares/leaps. Going theta gang till the bulls are back.
I laughed so hard at this.all my options are in the red except NIO smh
just keep putting adding some spare change into it and when it squeezes dip.
Best post year 2020.
lol why is everyone else not talking about this. same old GME, PLTR, PSTH plays. just look what TSLA did on announcement.

What competitive edge does FUBO have over other streaming platform? Why can't they be distrupted? Just curious coz I'm thinking of dipping my toes in.
Fuck please god no
Slot machine go brrrrrr
What dip am I buying today?
Sure. Three things mainly: 

1) Post-merge price drops (which I hadn't accounted for) became a thing, and I was holding everything straight through the merger with no OTM puts on the downside as a hedge. 

2) My EV SPACs were all priced (in terms of forward multiples) relative to each other. When SPACs and EVs started falling they all became correlated, so even though I was diversified by holding different tickers, I still had exposure to industry and asset class risk.

3) When FMCI announced that they didn't reach a quorum for the merger vote I panic sold near the bottom and missed out on a rally, effectively losing 300k relative to the day before.
Oh Cathie. Oh PLTR.
I have diamond hands when it would benefit me to close my position and paper hands when it would benefit me to stick it out. Wtf
I'll buy PLTR once it gets back to $10
It’s consolidating!
🚀🚀🚀

Can't wait for NIO day!!
Wouldn’t that be dumb.... 🤯
its already down 30% this week.  Might be a little late to the party.
PLTR has been unable to crack $30 since Andrew Left killed the bulls.  Meaning PLTR hasn't made a new high in over a month.

And then we had people a few days ago saying PLTR had a 99.8% chance of going higher at $29.

I think it's safe to say PLTR has been severely overhyped.
Red waterfalls every fucking day. Canoo fucked everyone that bought it soooo hard they should be delisted.

🌈🐻 confirmed.

All 🧢. I’m in Mo City. 🙌🙌

H-Town Down!
Down -24%, overall I was a terrible investor. I kept panic selling on the dips, buying at the highs. Only big wins were XPEV calls and PLTR bought in at 9.58. Shouldn't have sold anything I bought over this year, a terrible feeling but oh well.

Really good to see most people capitalize on the most volatile year in history, hoping to do better in the years ahead.
Alright who else has lost a fuck ton of money on FUBO this week. “no way it can gO eVEn loWER!¡”
AMZN and TSLA got a bounce on the dip, AAPL though? Nah no one wants that ghey shit.
Haven't felt this much despair since Tuesday.
is anyone looking at S K L Z? I thought it was a winner... looking kinda stupid now.
somebody give NIO a tampon...
goev is about to cheaper per share than pre merger months ago lol

“Record number of people chasing momentum stocks with margin” ?
Agreed. I figure it’s possible they could be rebalancing or selling winners to cover losers, etc. since I don’t really see a reason for the slide. Super quiet week in the markets all together just makes me think it’s a very “structural” week. I wouldn’t expect them to sell winners but I’ve never worked at an institution so who the fuck knows what they’re required to do

Ironically 2020 was my best year yet. I've been self quarantining my whole life in preparation for the lockdowns. Made 250k on stonks (thanks Elon) and got promoted at work making well over six figures now. Bought my first house with those gains and getting married in 2021. Thanks to this sub for being a constant source of entertainment and occasional useful DD.
22 is a support
Oof it hasnt looked like that for a few years. Their new UI finally looks like something not out of Windows 2000.

I see you left out taxes because you need gains for that
Wheel see a circuit breaker in January
reee what if Pres. Hoe Buyback kills the market :(
PLTR fucking me
i guess i needed yesterdays hit of dopamine for this shit
I remember when I was green. Good old days
UPWK so oversold

Earnings in feb too. Definitely a beat
I am. Think itll go sub 20?
Debating just moving my calls around enough to not be “substantially identical”

I feel like a pop is just around the corner and really don’t want to be out entirely
PLTR lockup ends after earnings and the float grows fivefold. What happens then?
Elon gonna drop the delivery numbers just to flex lol
SNAP cucked me

MT, dafaq is wrong with you? Low volume, but still.

Still time to ride the earnings wave
Im just so tired man

How is this like Nikola? Nikola had no products besides renderings. Canoo has 13 driving prototypes, completed over 50 crash tests, and already earning money ($34m this year and $120m next year) from engineering services.
Omg seeeeelllllll you’re gonna hit zero bitch
my bow will be my guide
Most retarded post I have seen this year.  Reddit awards are the way.
big cannabiz dumps today creating depressed people who will turn to cannabis to sooth their losses. **Bullish sign**
You didn’t miss the boat on GME:
1. Mid January is Holiday earnings
2. March is board election (Ryan Cohen takeover, hostile or not)
3. April is Q4 earnings
How long are you willing to wait for the GME squeeze, before abandoning the idea?
Imagine not buying the TSLA dip
Wait so I just post and get platinum . I love wsb autists

Not a bad investment really. Half of $0.00 is undefined.
This was the worst trading week😡all my stocks bleeding like crazy
RIOT, you sneaky bitch. Keep going up baby
Nio you stupid whore dont u dare bleed
Nice save
Imagine thinking GME is purely a WSB play🤡
I have enough buying power left for either: another gme call, more pltr shares, or another pltr call. Which one which one.
XL just blowing through every fucking technical support as per the Twitter retards. This shit is apparently meaningless when you get in at 30 percent down in a week and you still get ass fucked.

How the fuck did AAPL not hold $134 or $133, and now it’s working on breaking down $132?! is this a fucking joke?
Buy puts man
I know, it's insane though. These are good companies that are SEVERELY oversold, and they just keep fuckin selling. WTF IS THE FEDEX CHART FOR THIS MONTH ARE YOU FUCKING SERIOUS? GO LOOK AT IT.
Stupid idea to buy shit ton of Moderna calls a couple months out? They’re down so much from ATH
is the market closed tomorrow?
LOL
Sir get the fuck off the rocket we do not tolerate that language
fuck you
well this is a shitty way to end 2020. at least Donnie could pump it for laughs and giggles
Its a ride isn't it. Also, you're not going to be bag holding for long. Trust the DD thats been laid upon thee. We will see our green dildos again and it'll all make sense. This market is outrageous, and the ability to manipulate the price artificially is too easy. No bad news, and we drop 10% how does that make sense? It doesn't. GME has a lot going for it. Holiday sales, e-commerce growth, the slow evolution of man staying indoors does not bode well for the psyche and will create a need for communication via online gaming experience. Its all coming together Brother. 2021 WE RIDE STRONG, AND WE RIDE TOGETHER. NO 🧻🤚. ONLY 💎✊s AND 💎🍆s
Can I carry over capital losses of $1,500 to next year? or will I have to pay capital gains on potential profit after tomorrow for 2021?

theres a lot of things worse off than crm right now. consider urself lucky
Fuck you PLTR
anyone paying any attention to this lin wood guy? what a fuckin nutjob. You would think if he believed half the things he says are true he would be loaded to to tits with puts
Your advice is gonna be ignored on this sub. Buy high sell low
when the economy takes a shit, silver and gold go up.
the lock up period ends tomorrow if i’m correct meaning institutions will sell off

I'm wondering if FUBO eating shit is dragging the casino/sportsbetting stocks like DKNG/PENN with it because they overlap.

Can't believe DKNG retested $50 yesterday and it's down $3 from then.
NIO is allergic to 50, change my mind

NIO don’t be a cuck
New year trading rule for me: any options less than a month out will be bought as a spread first
Tim Cuck, CUCKED me hard the first week of September, yet he’s really going to do the same shit to start the new year
If AAPL ends red today it will be the first time AAPL has 3 in a row red day since April
Stocks red every single fucking day.  i guess this is sept and oct all over again

It’ll go away. 

When I was new I was shitting my pants on a -$200 day, now a 3 figure day doesn’t even feel like much of a movement. You’ll get used to those red days. Even a big red day you’ll eventually get used to. What’s important is staying the course.

I just want to break even on BABA then I promise I'll never invest in China ever again. I wont even get Chinese food, nothing, nada. 🇺🇸>🇨🇳
this is what the MMs want, I am doing the opposite, buying shares tho instead of options.
so... this is just the week that we’re always gonna dip at open?
if the AAPL/TSLA option never materialized, why would AAPL work with a vastly inferior option instead?
[removed]
ARKK sold their PLTR!
srsly why is the company trading below $1? It was $3000+ 5 years ago.. looks like the stock split a few times but that is a ridiculously low lol
The broker I have doesn’t allow for that. Maybe there are some who do, but I think opening an account with them is more difficult.
ALEX WHY HAVE YOU FORSAKEN ME?!
Any info on DKNG? I've been getting reamed and would like to know the sentiment.

Idk what that means which probably means I’m too young to know which probably means you’re a boomer which probably means 45-65
Ok I will say it. It's over.

There is no more gains to have. We will only see red now. There is only loss until next year. Then anything can happen, for this year, now it's all red.

What the actual fucking fuck is FUBO doing? How is it still dropping so hard.
USA and China have different markets
Been holding since 55 cents 🤣
Today would be the day to go long. It popped out of an upward channel 3x now and retraced backed 61.8% each time to get back into the trend. Right not is a best guess at a "bottom"
At 705 I would have dumped 10k into 0dte tsla puts but it never even got close. Oh well
Chitron trying to push PLTR down to $20, I hope they do so I can get that deep discount
Yes, have shares

Yes, there is a man who bought Visa at 207 foreseeing a gap up. Who sold at 210.5 thinking he done well.....
This is actually good advice I kept losing money so I started doing the opposite
ty for your wisdom
Amateur.
You from the future, can you tell what stock in going up right now from there?
After taking a massive loss the little dips just feel like minor bumps.
Does market close early today?
Seems like every time I buy into something it turns around and does a stock offering shortly after.
Yep, for a Meme Stock like Palantir i think we can expect exactly that to happen. Hope is a wonderful thing.
I fucking knew AAPL was to good to be true.

Fucking bull trap piece of shit right at open fuck you.
do more research to fight that gut feeling
When PLTR started IPO, it consolidated for a month before it blasted up. Be patient. 

Today is a red which mean it’s a day to buy.
OKTA turned around

jim cramer said this is a sign the selling is about to end
I was having such a nice 2 month span, up 20k. These 4 days have fucked me harder than any woman in my life. This must be what it's like for those 18 year old girls taking a 12 inch MANDINGO COCK IN THE ASS. I MEAN WHAT THE FUCK IS THIS MARKET? THE INDICES ARE FUCKING FLAT TO SLIGHTLY GREEN THIS WEEK AND I AM DOWN FUCKING 15%!!!!!!!! FEDEX, FUCK YOU AND YOUR SHIT TRUCKS. SALESFORCE... MORE LIKE SUCKFUCK, JESUS CHRIST YOU SHIT COMPANY. CANOO, MORE LIKE, COCK FUCKER!!!!!!! JESUS CHRIST SOMETHING FUCKING HAVE A GREEN DAY FOR CHRIST SAKE. I AM BLEEDING HARD. SOMEONE SAVE MY GOD DAMN PORTFOLIO.
It's not a stonk retard. It's an ETF. The price of the ETF has nothing to do with people buying the ETF. It's not large enough to move the market. Not to mention, people have been selling it, outflows are high.
How is BABA doing on the US market?
Fuck u never I’ll never let it dip that low

I Never use a debit card, only credit cards since I was 19. I’m 24 now. I have 54k in student loan debt and a car payment. Never ever ever missed a payment. I’ve never paid interest on a CC (harder on the loans) and I pay extra on just principal every month. I’ve had a job and rented my own place under my name and had CC’s and have never had any negative marks on my credit. So it’s 5 years of pure positive scores.

Hey, pltr. Fuck yourself
It do be holding 19 well.
I mean sooner or later TSLA is going to have a huge correction, possibly down to $5000 if it doesn't split again first.  The question is what strike do you sell your calls at before that to take advantage of some of that crazy premium?
50 should just bend over and let NIO have it. It’s going to happen one way or another.
Any news why $SLV call volumes up so much?
Sold TSLA at 702 for 35K profit. Heavily bought SQ at 215 and DOCU at 222. Not gonna lie, I feel like a goddam king.

It means Tesla has hit the 500k deliveries as the market is hoping for this year, and as Musk predicted in a 2016 TV interview.

Hence why the stock is going up again at the moment - probably insiders.

Been investing since July and still find it emotionally difficult to accept the price of my stocks dropping, even though I know they have to if they're to eventually go higher. 

How long until this feeling passes and you're no longer phased by the down turns?
Why do you think it will increase
Just bought it on the dip. Learn to stonk.
Give me a ternion
better for humans, not for bank accounts
Some ppl made some good money, but what did ppl expect it was just going to go right back to 300? It could flounder for months or drop more its a gamble compared to other stocks
GME be like whats all that about 💅🏾
This is amazing, thanks you crazy bastard

No idea when the squeeze happens. I've been in this since before Q3 earnings. People have said Q3, Cohen buy in, Jan 1st, ICR conference, Q4. All I know is that the price will go up, shorts defo have to exit. An infinity squeeze is a bonus for me.
Officially out if PLTR. Burned me too many weeks in a row. Was holding calls a year out and they've been slowly bleeding down
Damn this sub is famous for making bad investments but this ...
yeahhhhh when I buy I usually go all in. Had 40K I wasnt doing anything with so I threw it into them

Yeah I mean this seems pretty true. We have to get to a very rough spot to have a major crash that they can't just print through.
Am I fuk?
Glad I didn’t diamond my SQ weeklies and sold at yesterday’s pop. Might load up on 15-30 DTE calls if it drops to 210 today.
Well I started in August and I'm down about 1200 right now, but a lot of that is due to the red day today, hopefully breaking even next week, haha I'm a degenerate gambler
Bad day to buy pltr yesterday
QS straight to zero damn
Certainly not at 20

It's worthless, stay away from that garbage. It's a pump and dump they are pumping the algos on here for.

Oh phew I might break even

That would be cool.

Market is closed genius
It’s been a long ride from $900 pre split, it was time to take profits. I’ll be getting in on any dip below 600

I'll check back in on expiry. At this point I'm going all or nothing
If I sell a losing call today only to roll it out to next year, do I get to count that as a loss on my 2020 taxes or does the wash rule somehow apply?
Broke even because my dumbass bought a PLTR option at the peak...
So boring today

Why would you commit such an atrocity
Ahh i got like $1k red for my ARKs too. Averaged up at the top. Nice.
I see you've made it through the first 2 stages of grief and are now at bargaining
I'm not too far off ya man

not ashamed to say I am in at 103.20 lol

Its been All Time Highs just about every week for months, so any red week would leave recent buyers as having "bought at the top"
Honestly, I see a manager who is not bought in the the transition and is not flexible.  Unfortunately this is a leader in the organization who likely won’t be with the company in the future.  Sure it sucks, but we are in a pandemic and the company is shifting.  Every organization has people who are resistant to change.  All I see is venting and this really actually shows me that GME is making changes in the right direction.
Papa Elon out here fighting for our fucking lives 😖
Hahahahaha truest thing I have ever read here
I played the warrants for a nice 300% gain, missed the bigger pop before IPO, but I wasnt falling for that shit again post IPO.

HAVE CONFIDENCE!!!

DONT SELL BUY MORE BE BRAVE FIGHT TO NOT BE A WAGE SLAVE 

IT AINT FUCKEN EASY BITCH!!!!
This is not for tax reasons, this is general market bullshit. Tax reason profits were taken over the month, they don’t wait this long. At this point taking profits and paying taxes in 3 months on gains would be stupid, people want to play with their gains money next year. Expect a sell off after the new year.
Hold
I want to puke . I sold my NIO shares yesterday for more MT calls lmao
Imagine thinking 2021 will be any better

(serious) could someone explain to me what’s all this GME 🚀 about? cant really find information that isn’t a bunch of memes on here. thanks!
I’ve got $1k to play with. Deep itm NIO calls the move for their reveal day?
If you buy this FCEL dip, it will most likely climb back up next week. I have no knowledge on to why, but just trust a fellow retard
Absolutely not
NIO 🤪
I seem to remember a DD post here not long ago about ENPH being "a scam", back when it was about $90ish.
I don't care if my entire portfolio crashes harder than a 737 MAX, I'm not selling my 217.5c's
I know this is sacrilege, but I can’t see GME. GameStop is a shit company and all I see is Blockbuster 2.0.

Imagine watching Cramer re runs and applying them to the live market... epicly retarded

Why?
[deleted]
I dont know shit about Palantir's business model or how they plan to grow or anything. I barely understand the company. But, the name is fucking cool and has that same nerdy but badass flavor as Tesla. And, the stock is liquid as fuck and the volatility is amazing.
you talk to them?

Here comes the bull flag breakout in GME
Is this day different then other days?
Major indexes like: what dip? I don’t see a dip, Amazon is doing just fine!
Lost 99% of pfe calls after being up 500% on pltr I should have kept listening to wsb
I keep playing airlines and I keep getting fucked. This is a very basic lesson yet here I am.
Today it’s looking for support at the vwap anchored to the November breakout. Vwap form the ipo is around 20. If the institutions believe in this company, it will find support at one of those two levels. If not, it will go to single digits an the get acquired by a amazon for penny’s lol
At the very least I can get wasted tonight and not be judged so harshly since it's new years eve so there's that 🎉🥂🥂😭😭😭
The market was just giving us a buy opportunity...BTFD!
Lol autists or retards? Autards? Retists?
It's only 30 minutes in and I've aged like 3 days on this price movement
Big dick energy
profit from selling PLTR puts too easy
Dude same. I’ve only got shares but holy fuck lol
Canadian here. You guys are something special. I want in!

[Yeah I got receipts](https://imgur.com/a/wtFnc3H)
Not sure I'd call PLTR a meme stock.  And to be honest, you can make a decent return on meme stocks if you watch and preserve gains.
Correct.
pick up ETFs and shit for reoccurring deposits. ARK, BRK.B, etc. etc. etc.
Buying the PLTR dip today
Can someone give us the TLDR
So apparently I blew several decades of this guy's compounded dividends on a gaming pc
Steel on sale today! Not a bad idea to get in long
Where my steel barrons at!
yup i got margin and covered calls. opened a robinhood account for options
Thanks!
Get a girl who looks at you the way we all look at Palantir or GME
Nope.  Look at the spread.  Shorts are panicking
You are just in time for the GME moon mission though.
I think so too
Sir, this is the casino floor, you are looking for the [old folks home](/r/investingforbeginners )

Edit: better luck next time, rookie.
if you're coming here for advice, you've already lost
[deleted]
Tomorrow yes tomorrow
I can't decide what is best, as I still think there is gonna be a correction.  I had sold 10 put contracts at 135 in Jan.  I rolled them to 160.  I think I'm gonna wait until next week.  See what happens.
So like gap up 10% but still close down 12%, got it.
Not yet I sold 1/29s I think they’ll pop prior to Pltr day.

I’ve got 2 contracts out rn, I’d have more but I got stuff tied up in other plays sadly. 

🔮🚀🌝 Pltr gang
Puts?
How do you squeeze shorts on pltr when all it does is go down
Kandi is going to be the next new EV player. I foresee a Kia-like trajectory for them.
THCB.
Already bought 50 @ $24
I don’t feel good about my 2/5 80c
Year ain’t over yet
Cathy you killing me girl
At this point I don’t do DD. I just buy the FKn dip. Works until it doesn't *taps head*
Shes a devout Christian and neckbeards are mad.
What's with the selloff? Is this to do with taxes? If so should bounce back higher and we should be buying the dip
Those spy puts look good though
How bout just an educated guess
People say we are selling off for tax reasons I wonder if it’s for the run off as well.
Sure hope so otherwise I’m just gonna have to 💎✋
I made 3200 this year.

 CMG cured cancer or something? Jeez I’m glad I sold my puts before that. I was regretting selling since it continued drilling, but damn idk what it’s pumping for now.

Who sold baba at the bottom
FUBO on its way to zero
that's quite optimistic, better chance of making stanford or harvard with those odds lol
I will thanks for the recommendation. I 100% feel you on that manual labor shit though. I’ve been in manual labor jobs my entire life except current job excluded.
i sold my nio 42c to buy what i thought was the fubo dip yesterday 🤡
If S230 ends without something to replace it with then the economy tanks lol. Also reddit ends
Weird flex but okay

if you are buying cause you heard it went parabolic you are buying at the top. Don't chase at the end. Dog catches the car. Check any chart, see where it was a lot lower previously? that's where it's going again eventually.

Which indices?
Exactly.
If you are sure about it then always BTFD.
Nah, ICNL does this every day. Gap up overnight, fall to yesterdays close then trades within like 0.5% throughout the day. You really think clean energy will crash amidst countries going green?
RIP
Got calls yesterday near 517. Wanna load more if it dips. Agree it’s gone sideways too long. Going back to 550 next year before their ER
What a weird day. No consistency with sectors. Some tickers mooning for no reason whatsoever. What a shit show.
GYNA EV MOONING
You can, they restricted your account
Where’s Nio going by eod tho
Imagine thinking liquidity is not a problem when there are >10cent spreads everyday.

Not saying this will be a VW scenario, but to think that shorts having to buy 130% of the float won't change the price is delusional.

As time goes on it looks like they won't cover unless forced too. If a vote is coming, it will force them out and they will all head to the exits at the same time. I see this as the most likely opportunity for any squeeze. Otherwise we will just continue to climb on fundamentals and RC news.

Your post is FUD.

I sold TSLA short at 703 during the open and now I'm watching it drill.
Lol I'm aware - thankfully it's all long steel calls 😎

Last time someone said GOEV on this forum I bought instantly. I bought high and gonna sell low 😎😎🚀🚀🚀
Wait so you’re telling me if I buy nio today it’s free moneys????
Please, instead of buying awards, please buy another share of AYX so my options don’t expire worthless
+180%. Started trading as the market was crashing in March. Bought into mostly stay at home tech,  a few bioscience companies like NVAX, TSLA, and the occasional meme stock. Pretty happy with this considering I really only did shares until I bought a few YOLO's on GME.

i should probably rename the watchlist to that
Lol you seem bitter. 4 Biden comments in less than 10 minutes, yikes. Get some air
[removed]
Yes, good luck. 50% loss (over the last week) definitely meets my criteria to be cut. But this is already a cord cutter so I’m holding.
I think the military folks that have used their systems will be its biggest sales force when they transition to private sector.  Hey we had this awesome product that I know how to use and solved our problems I think it will help us here boss...
NET is ridiculous

No, they like your coke, not you.
I bought tesla this morning!
GME 🚀🚀🚀

Edit: CRSP, set and forget weekly contributions
[removed]
Guys if pltr keeps going from 30 to mid 20s then keep buying more at the mid 20s the fuck
Every single day this week, there's a spike up at the start of the trading session and then a smash down after that. Everyone here probably noticed it already, yea but this is highly suspicious.

Hahaha god I hope this isn’t true.
Me out of TSLA @ 700 for good

That’s what it looks like has been happening all week imo 

The meme stocks that are up bigly this year have been slacking. Remember Monday when the entire meme stock industry was down 6%? That’s the profit taking imo

Like SQ. There’s really no reason for SQ to have had that slide other than profit taking
Market is trying to price in a Biden administration today lol
Remember everyone, this is Mitch McConnell's fault
What are ur favorite stock sales today??
I bought net after that 10% down day on promises that it would recover...

Atleast they're 1/15 calls 🤷‍♂️ bags are feelin heavy though.
Just put a bid on a $500k 3600 sq. ft. house. Wish me luck brothers.
Right...

Wow, I’m retarded. 20 APPL contracts, 100 DKNG contracts, 2 lmnd contracts. I think I bought the dip but they keep getting lower for some reason.🤷‍♂️ 31Dec expiry😂🚀🌝
NIO day is still the ninth correct? Today has me confused
PLTR puts are free money
😶
No one trading netflix this week?

Sad I dismissed this earlier.  Now if it's here,  no chance.
Because paying taxes sooner than later
I bailed on it yesterday. Still made 60% gains so no complaints at all, but this is going to continue downward for a while until after the lockup expires.
that was the jump, its gonna dip and ride for the day then pump again

edit: pump in next premarket is my guess
Am I retarded? I keep buying the pltr dip
nibbas be like  HAPPY NEW YEAR   🎉🥂😥🍾
TSLA going red is about to drag this whole meme market down today.

Hold on tight boys & girls... shits about to get zany
Don't you love a full week of open high -> -2%?
Oh well time to buy some dips
I have faith. 💎✋
Nio just saved my whole portfolio. Holy fuck. What a day.
I could tell you how it feels to buy more of them after a 10% correction
SBE down 20% this week is good stuff
America only dumps Gyna only pumps got it! US Stocks piece of fucking SHIT
Itll level out around 10$ and bounce around in between 9$ and 12$ for the next 8 or 9 months.

After that, pennystock.
Yes, but that takes time that won't be solved quickly. In the meantime every vaccine needs to be used as soon as it arrives.

Morning gents. I have roughly 200 a week to throw into stonks. My portfolio is 99% options already but want to set up reoccurring deposits and buy a couple share every week. What stonks yal holding and don't fucking tell me gme. Im thinking uber and spce

2020 = good financial year, terrible human year

thus, I expect either puts will print, or the market ends the year flat

I’m so tempted to go in on NIO now but I know it’s definitely going to dip...
I feel like I’m watching the beach landing scene from Saving Private Ryan.
I just called in and quit my job thanks to NIO. Next week is NIO day (major announcements concerning new vehicles, battery tech, manufacturing expansion, and entry into EU market) I'll be retiring. 🚀 🌕

January’s looking to be so fucking bullish. I can’t wait.
For what it’s worth- we knew today would be rocky... Most are holding though today
ok im in with you clowns, although havent gone full YOLO:

BUY +1 GME 100 (Weeklys) 8 JAN 21 20 CALL @ $1.05 LMT \[TO OPEN\]
Good luck today! I was able to make a $250 profit
Lol. Imagine buying the top with a senile non-business acumened geriatric president coming in
What in the fuck just happened??

Can’t wait to see NIO on Monday
everything in my portfolio officially in the deep red, minus NIO somehow
[deleted]
Why would you?
[removed]
Anyone think it's worth holding onto APHA and TLRY until the Georgia election?  Basically in my mind if dems win Georgia they get the senate, meaning they can make some real progress with cannabis legalization.   


Currently I'm thinking if the Dems get Georgia then we could see a run up on pot stocks.  If not, I'm thinking cannabis will shit the bed again.   Thoughts?
This is the way

Not buying the dip until pltr hits 22
Thank you for new years eve discounts. Let me buy some cheap stock and calls
That’s actually a really good assessment

Thank you PLTR for allowing me to double down on my position. Very cool buying opportunity!
DOOR TRASH... reeks price manipulation
Yo are you the dude I explained this to yesterday? Nice job not being lazier than me lmao I’d never have made a post
Almost all red, need to buy a few more...
Do not do this. QS ran too hot
FUBO is a great company but you cant call it a discount just because its down a lot from the highs. The price it was trading at was just ridiculous and caused by speculators, not because the company is actually worth that much. 

However, still a great stock to swing once it reversals but you gotta rely on TA. Not a fundamental play at these prices
Remember to put your arm swimmies on before going in the pool today.
Wow........all at discount by EOD
¯\_(ツ)_/¯༼ つ ◕_◕ ༽つ(´・ω・`)
Anyone giving up on PLTR are the same people to flee during a great heroic battle ha
Finally buy into ARK funds after hearing about them forever, first week -13%.

4:20 retard
.. Guess I’ll wait until the end of the day to buy in then
Anyone here holdings these FUBO bags with me? Have shares and some February calls...
PLTR does this everyday and you retards act surprised. 26.05 EOD.
$NIO is bouncing back up 🚀🚀🚀
Same 😭 should've just cut my losses yesterday

Holding these bags into 2021 I guess
hella bagholders were made this week lmao
I have jan and feb calls as well.  Down 60% so far.  Good luck, we need some buyers to join us.
But i guess it makes sense after last weeks jump, come back to earth a bit.   But hopefully it finds its floor soon.
PLTR pleas fly
9:50 and I’m down -1.4% 

It’s only up from here

WHY THE FUCK don’t the Dems agree to Mcconell’s call for ending Section 230 and humoring Donnie with some election integrity BS? Then we all get $2,000. Those fuckers don’t want to lose their social media propaganda machine.

It’s now about to hit 23.5

I’m old enough to remember the short attack earlier this year and how half this sub pissed their pants over it.
Losses weren’t too bad when it dipped red for a minute, still haven’t sold though bitch!
This is as bad as a default sub. This subreddit is officially dead.
yeah i’m longing PLTR for their AI not thinking of dropping them I was just asking if it’s smart to buy more bc of the morning dip
idk how AMD hasn’t take all their market share. Intel is actual shit
My dumbass sold my 1/15 51c hoping I could average down to 50 but it never fell so in 1/8 48c I am.
bought calls this morning
Correct
Sorcerers stones
So that’s the autist I sold to

Save the best for last, I guess

It’s been 5 minutes since my last post. I deeply regret selling NIO. It’s probably gonna 70 today because I’m a fucking loser
Not bad at all my guy. And I’m glad you got out, waiting til EOD would’ve destroyed those lol

Be honest. If it wasn't for the memes, would any of you seriously consider buying gme? It's been a dying company for years. The only thing that caused it to raise was the PS5 shortage and a likely pump and dump. I haven't been to one in at least 13 years and I had forgotten they were still around. There are much better pawn shop stocks you can invest in my friends.
Then back to 30
Why?
Oh snap PTON gonna make moves
Fuck 2020
Just a day right?

Yeah but TV rights for sports are a massive, massive business. Like, that's the core of the NFL's business by a huge margin over tickets, merch, and sponsorships.

Nio at $50, fuck the haters
There are 100 dollar rewards? Like you pay 100 for Reddit to display the award thingy next to a post? That would be wildly retarded to pay money for. Way worse than buying GME.
Fucking MT, is this shit ever going to go anywhere but down
Yolo exists
I spoke to a colleague who used it (ex British intelligence drone) and he confirmed it used to be reliant on embedded Palantir consultants who knew how to operate it. From what I understand the new products are more SAAS based and designed to operate without the consultancy.

How did you guys get it into your heads that they’d all have to cover at once, you understand if they don’t panic they don’t squeeze right? And if they didn’t panic after a 30% rise they’re not going to at all
Jesus I'm down 6% before 10am. See ya'll next year, fuck this.
Lots of red
Fuarkkk, QS gon crack 90 and never look back
I’m probably gonna wait until Thursday or Friday next week before NIO day
When you sell puts on the Pltr dip but she keep on dippin’ 💦🍆😩
If it’s good enough to ask, it’s good enough to take profits
Fk you ARKG
To be fair this guy is earning $12 a year and half the people here lost $10,000 this year so
look at $NIO

&#x200B;

should've just bought more when it was hovering around $42-43 earlier this week.
Buy ETF they said. Buy arkg they said. Can’t go tits up they said.

Not sweating at all. Had to roll down some short calls as a hedge against my longs (which subsequently will further limit my upside), but I am playing PLTR defensively. Unsurprised there is weird shenanigan's happening at the end of the year, and won't be surprised if PLTR stays low through January as well. 

Looking to see where we bottom out

Not really irrational when you consider know one knows the value of the company. People are buying because it swings 5-10% in a day. They don't care what the company does.
NIO 50c 1/15/21 WILL PRINT 🚀💎🙌🏼
Garbage week. Cathie been sucking dick lately. AAPL not reacting to any of this positive hype. QQQJ stunted growth. Not selling anything because I know a ridiculous moon mission is in bound for all three but still frustrating.
I’m guessing FB is up cause they were loyal 👀 somethings in the waterrrrr
NIO gang we back!
no i did not want to buy “the fucking dip” today .. jesus christ fuck the algo mass-selling
Guys, give thanks to papa Elon for all that he's done for you this year and buy some GD TSLA

lost a little on PLTR but is it smart to buy this dip?
Sounds like everyday

3k initial investment back in March. Over time I built it up to around 100k playing various options. Then I yolo’d that onto a retard play last month and fell all the way back down to 25k. Going to end the year at about 30k. Not bad.
Sold pltr now all in on nio calls for nio day and already up over 200 percent. Already seeing greens. Will be back in pltr after nio day jan 9 with my nio gainzzzzz
I want a award!

Some are boomer plays, some are memes, and some SPACs. Nothing is playing well right now.

true. i don’t see baba going back to 300 in a month though, which you basically need to happen.
I'm having some of that coffee from Bali those cat-weasel things eat and then shit out before they roast it and put it in a bag. Pretty damn good. Do they trade futures on that stuff?
[deleted]
Did I miss the award train?
ICLN crash imminent. Can't wait.
Looks like someone just dumped a massive number of PSTH shares
PLTR is a great company. It’s just has no reason to be worth twice as much as it’s worth today.

You can’t pump and dump everything that easily
TLDR the decline from $50 to $2 was unwarranted. It was due to Citron exploiting the very low float of Jumia. If the Jumia hype continues, the move upwards will continue to violent up until the earnings.
Holy shit, what a bad week to sell $47 covered calls on NIO. Wtf..
Go go go nio go
No kidding. No reason for it to retrace this badly
Do you just buy ARKG shares and hold at this point? Looking to get into ARK, don't currently have any.
Son of bitch, I’m in
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
It’s a year-end sell-off. Buy some calls bc shit is gonna moon in Jan
Barely. And it's still down 11% on the weekly. Don't count your Ryan Cohens before they hatch.
all my NIO calls are printing [🤑](https://emojipedia.org/money-mouth-face/) [🚀](https://emojis.wiki/rocket/#:~:text=Meaning%20of%20%F0%9F%9A%80%20Rocket%20Emoji,user%20is%20determined%20to%20fulfill.)[🚀](https://emojis.wiki/rocket/#:~:text=Meaning%20of%20%F0%9F%9A%80%20Rocket%20Emoji,user%20is%20determined%20to%20fulfill.)[🚀](https://emojis.wiki/rocket/#:~:text=Meaning%20of%20%F0%9F%9A%80%20Rocket%20Emoji,user%20is%20determined%20to%20fulfill.)

ZM dying. Finally
Does ARKG have a bottom?
How are FB and INTC up lmaooo
Sorry, I m  drunk because of new years eve and all this, but is this kind of massive retarded?
best to make less plays and rather a few good plays
When you say rookie you must mean retard right?
[deleted]
why is NIO up?
ARKG fucking ass raped me this week.
Chinese ev can’t be stopped 🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳🇨🇳
Fucking sweet everything red
Nio trying to carry my portfolio all by itself
Wtf SQ
Lotta red out there.
So when does this day turn green?
Someone should tell that to its stock price
the mouse is overpriced (don't tell him I said so)
Everyone
I will accept my award as shares of GME 🚀🚀🚀
Nio is go for launch🚀
Just don’t make 25k by December 31st and lose it all on January 1st lol
NIO and XPEV? Really?
"Also you tend to get a little more for a put than a call due to dividends."

Sorry, what do you mean by that? My understanding is that dividends are distributed to shareholders.
well this blows
It’s what they do best
[deleted]
GME
Pls be true 😭
NIO TO THE MOON!🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

[deleted]
Hmmm let me just rub my crystal ball and find out

PLTR drilling
Is this Elon’s way of rewarding us for pumping TSLA to the moon?
Green dildo on WISH

Sell Vix puts
[deleted]

Guess we’re drilling. Happy new year losing money
I also backtested a simple strategy which trades based on WallStreetBets discussion, [write-up here](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/knq2wh/the_wsb_hedge_fund_2020_annual_report/).

Tell me if you have any ideas for what to call our hedge fund, my best idea was "WSB Tender Management"
Should have exited Monday AM, Tuesday AM, Weds PM, today AM, jesus
don't you love when every stock you own is red, and that VXX hedge you have is also red. the stock market is so easy lol. God I love losing thousands of dollars every day!!!
Bro loading up on NIO FDs yesterday was *chefs kiss*🧑‍🍳
Another AAPL red day, greatttt.
Should have held my calls a little longer. Sold during the mini-pull back on the 21st
“And that’s how I got my wife addicted to coke”
Im scared for his future too, he could be a multimillionaire putting that all in GME....sad
I wouldn’t buy it to begin with so sell
MU fly yes
NIO DONT GIVE A FUCK
🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🤌🏾
See that in your crystal ball?
Fuck this guy.
ARKGuh
I was $0.40 away from my MT calls printing today. They decided they wanted to expire worthless instead. They’re on the same wavelength as my SPACs this week too. All down 7-15%. Fuck
PLTR finally on sale
When should I sell NIO??? I’m up 16% not trying to get too greedy
it hasn't just been SQ.
tsla and nio are money sucking machines all meme stocks are ded
[deleted]
Today's market can suck my white ass
Pltr is shit
[deleted]
PLTR going to 20 then 15.
No doesn't have a sell wall of any real size until 50.50. (103k)
LIMIT DOWN
so tomorrow
PSTH why
I knew ICLN puts would print
Sì Señor
SPCE mission to earths core
You should've asked that before not buying shares
Riding GME 🚀🚀🚀 fuck Wall Street
what an absolute shit NYE
Pleas blow again
Pltr is such a fucking shit stock to own
Ok. Fuck the CCP. We're long overdue acknowledging that trade and prosperity did not make the CCP less authoritarian.
They wouldn’t do that to their paying customers... wait a sec.
I own 400+ shares in the highest of 20’s. 

So high it hit the price again once, after hours😭
F
Fool me once, but not again
ARKK, ARKG, ARKF all up huge on premarket

&#x200B;

And then market opened. Neat stuff.
Finally.
Low volume trading on PLTR. Don't think this is permanant. Don't trust the low prices
Goddamnit NIO, I was going to liquidate you today.  NIO GANG FOR LIFE!
[deleted]
[deleted]
Double down and average down those calls. You will feel 10x worse loosing out on a major bagger than just loosing this money.
Sell now or hold ?😊
[removed]
So my April calls are gonna print? 4/16 30c 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Agreed but the vulnerable group has to be willing to take it. You can’t just force stuff into people’s bodies 🐒
Really hope the Tesla and SPY put yolo dude didn’t shit his pants at open and sell
[deleted]
yes pls
Every time I come back from a break from options trading I always lose a significant amount the first trade. It’s tradition.
STOP THE COUNT!
Yup
🚀🚀🚀You guys aren't helping anything. Post rocket emojis to make the markets go up! 🚀🚀🚀
Palantards are sweating
This is stocks getting ready for Bidens America
This shit is fucking amazing....
I didn’t vote for the fucker, anyway we can find his holdings and burn his tendies?
[deleted]
Pump and dumps everywhere, and MT laying there like a flaccid penis
Anybody down to come to my place for a nio day watch party/orgy?
And WISH has liftoff!
Nio boyyyy
Haha, CNN is retarded. the simple gut check here is just look at the market cap. Current BABA market cap of $635B. An 800% increase would imply a market cap of $5T. So unless you retards think BABA is going to be worth 2.5x AAPL and 3x AMZN in a year, this is clearly a currency conversion issue or CNN is straight spewing lies
If I was on the Jumia board I'd really push the JumiaPay service. Nigeria is not like the US where people just shop and buy from a small list of markets. A lot of the shopping experience is personal. If Jumia pushed for it to be the equivalent of what Square is for America, it would be extremely successful.
Almost midnight in japan Bruh
FYI this is the bottom, we are rocketing next week
P!

HOLD THE LINE TSLA
So do we have a rotation away from growth? Does this mean a crash is coming?
DAMNNN NIO THO....,
Please limit up to end the year right 🙏
Gay day going back to sleep
Nothing feels better than selling your puts at a lose only to see them ITM 5 minutes later🤡🤡🤡
Who the fuck is still buying BKNG? I’m gonna keep bitching and it just keeps going higher.
SPY is stuck
I think there will be a profit taking right before nio day and then pump again
NIO and TSLA going in opposite directions
No
Cash Gang, Stand by and stand ready
[deleted]
Mt will be the end of me
how tf are all the stonks I have calls on down over 2% on a flat day?
Yup
everything has been dog shit. Just an EOY sell off. Watch, next week or the week after will be moon city once the profit taking is done.
Need a yolo day trade. Whats the move
look at the past few days... im no TA nerd but there is obviously a whale making buys at 19. that is the floor, it wont go much lower. i bought shitloads of 18 and 19 strike calls and i'd recommend anyone who likes money do the same
If your not buying AAPL idk what you’re doing. Beating estimates and ER coming up
Is Fubo going to stop dying? I’ve lost a lot
[deleted]
Time for all you tards to fomo in on NIO!!!  It is going to 60+ by NIO day!

Sony baby you're my forever girl
These are naked.. i'm STO. Not STC.
[deleted]
I have no fucking clue, but from what I’ve seen it either stands for Due Diligence or Double Down. The first being research into the company and their performance financially and the second being an explanation why you should buy a metric shit ton since this is WSB and if you’re not 💯% in you best leave.
Please stop PLTR, I’m saying uncle, my bum bum hurts 🍆🍆
I dont like this ride
[deleted]
The night is darkest just before the dawn. Tendies await us in 2021. Don’t pussy out from others closing things out for the year
Whoever said fuck the ARCT vaccine is ur hero
Smh my head
Up 45% since I started trading this October. Options basically got my gains on steroids. Just sold all of my ICLN 01/15 calls for +~350%.

Just rebalanced my portfolio to 50% renewables. Manifesting a green earth with a green portfolio 🌳🚀
Shit NIO 50..  welcome back you son of a bitch
NIO 70 next week 🚀
buy buy buy
PRINTING HOLY SHIT
Lol
lol your buddy is in deep
MM’s are going to keep PFE range bound to fuck over both call and put holders aren’t they
Assuming they all exit at the same time. I'm thinking hedge funds might choose to wait for the squeeze to come back down before exiting again.
Same bought a fuckton more pltr was always a stock play and not options
[removed]
Give me a V!
PLTR is gonna go below 20, isn't it?
[deleted]
Not if you don’t realize the loss
isn’t the last trading day of the year usually pretty shitty
Is there hope for GOEV? 🤧
This guy is playing 5D chess. Absolute genius man.
They can be held by the company freely available for sale. So yes technically “someone” sold them. But the implication was that they were shares already purchased and sold for profit and that someone was letting their shares go.
Sq
Wall Street bets so retarded they spend money on fake awards to make sure their budget is red too
VXX DED

no going to lie... I'm seriously considering selling my share in PLTR, it has not blown up like all you fuckers say it will... wtf mate :P
[deleted]
All my gains from yesterday are *POOF* gone 

🙃
Can we short DASH and ABNB yet? Or is there a 30 day period for IPO’s?
Cause Boomers are still allowed to trade and all they know is panic selling.
All this before NIO day too
Mara. Nio. Making my Dick hard. 🚀
Haha i knew AAPL would go red. Fuck this piece of shit
bull case 15% while bear is 5%  
🚀🚀🚀
Wtf is GME and how do I buy it
Yeah. That pump and dump.is passed. Other pump and dumps.like GME and PLTR still in dump.phase if you want to lose money along with a crowd.
Those Jan calls will be just fine wait and see diamon hands rewarded with diamonds
Stop voting for him
May the trendies be with you!  Apparently there are still people on here that don’t understand retard is a badge of honor. The market makes us all retards at some point.  How dare I give an opinion that I believed would help you avoid losses or shit returns. Next time I’ll just reply “I’m in!!!!” with the obligatory rockets because we all know it’s more important to have a circle jerk where there’s no risk of getting your feels hurt than having a place where our investing ideas get challenged and we all get rich.  I’ll do better next time.

NIO YOU BEAUTIFUL BOY
It’s pushing that $50 resistance already, will hit $53-$55 mid day.
Wait 😂
Post positions screenshot - want to see this
GOEV is getting the HYLN treatment. It's painfully obvious
Where is that TA Astrology retard that said Palantir was going to break out of the wedge this week to +$30? You even called yourself a "professional trader". Come take your lashings like a man.
NIO is making the 50c calls I sold look like a joke
Let’s see how much money I can lose today.
Cramer suddenly bearish?
ICLN
Rip in piece Tesla
dat tsla candle
Rookie mistake buying options at open.. you always *sell* options at open for that reason.
note to self: always buy puts in the last week of the year
Then the lines won't be very long. All the more reason to give it first come first serve. Don't let them sit in freezers while very specific groups don't use them.
I put most of my profits into VWRL like a pussy

Just closed my various ARKG puts. Bought at $95, $100 and $105 over the past 2 weeks. 

Picked up $22k in profit (about 35%).
Hey GME, it sure would be nice for you to start 2021 at $21.
For Nio? Thanks!
Who else is getting destroyed right now???
Good god I hope so.

Started trading in February with $10k. Became a massive gay bear on the crash and made it all the way up to $220k. Then promptly lost the majority of that over the course of the next 9 months. Sitting at +$21k on the year.

Every fucking open this week has been an absolute shitshow
Just fucked me
Taowch
[deleted]
These are all signs of a perfectly healthy market. Completely unrelated sectors dumping in lockstep.
[removed]
I'm trying to be lazy, but twice this week I've had to close my CSPs early for +90% 🤣 Brrrrrrrrr
This makes me hard
While it's true that the stock is pretty liquid, most of this trading is dark pool/HFT that drives over 90% of the number of shares traded. Earlier in the year there were days when GME traded 60 million shares (technically every share in existence) but 95ish% of those were by bots, meaning that there were only about 3 million shares available for the average trader (like a short-seller). It's also important to look at what the trading volume was on the days that VW was squeezing; it definitely spiked from the 1 million shares. On top of this, during a squeeze people will be chasing the price up, meaning that demand will spike and even fewer shares will be available for the general public on top of the ones traded by bots. Don't let the 15 million figure fool you.
It’s a share game right now boi

Snap puts 🤞🏻
Just bought more
is the market down because it's raining?
Every fucking day, I lose $1k from open in less than 20 minutes, not even funny anymore
If it helps I’m about to buy crm calls

YO ROBIN HOOD GOING FUCKING PUBLIC WE NEED EVERY AUTIST FOR THIS 1 everybody load calls straight out the gate so market makers have to delta hedge
OP, dis some dumb shit. The days-to-cover is >5. Coulda said you dumb and big numbers make yo head hurt in ~10 words.
Markets are being nice and lessening our tax burdens this year guys
B-N-G-O baby 🚀🚀🚀🚀

I absolutely agree 

I just unloaded some 135c 0DTE I picked up before close yesterday for a quick 50% and now just waiting for a reentry point
Oh you missed the entire week of trading?
All that money that could've been spent on TSLA calls lmfao
Selling FUBO puts, the premiums are juicy af rn.
ARKG???
For 3 months I bought $10 worth of every stock I saw in an article on my Google feed. I am up 22% BUT I don't know what half of these tickers are.
Take and go
I did bitch
PR will be a catalyst for sure. They are behind on the tech curve. A 250 mi battery range when NIO and Tesla are pushing the 400+. This needs to sell to delivery companies for the last-mile usage case. I am excited to see what their truck and sedan models look like but I do think they have headwinds ahead. 

I’m also long on shares by the way.
No
Wegmans will never go public just for the record
#BRUH
AAPL will finish the day in green
Uh oh no bueno

This didn't age well bro.
VXX plummeting
Felt this, bought in yesterday thinking a reversal
What if Robinhood purposely fucks us up to keep the money we lose👀
I'm pretty sure TSLA will be the bellwether for what happens to the markets in 2021.. ie the fall in TSLA will mark risk off precisely.
Everyday? Irrational. 

Timing it right consistently? Irrational 

Timing it right just once? Feels pretty rational
Cmon boys where do I yolo today. Don’t do me wrong

How is it possible to lose every single day. You’d think I’d have at least one green day all week

WSB: "Oh my god red everywhere the sky is falling, get out with your life!"

SPY: Down -0.08%

lmao
Exactly what I said lol
pleas fly
baba bent my shit over
I’m just here to ~~be a part of~~ make history.

Edit: at friendly suggestion of award giver.
Sold my NIO calls. 100% profit in 2 days. Learning my lesson about getting fucked by theta. Maybe I left some money on the table but I don’t give a fuck.
There are like 4 fucking NQ stocks that are green and it's enough to make the index actually go up.

Everything else drilling IMMEDIATELY at open

Low volume day = MM's do whatever the fuck they want
My broker updates most stocks 15min later...sometimes that feels good 😁
$YOLO
No such ticker
The great sell off has begun
i really do, i can prove that by the 40k in options i bought this morning expiring that day
if i knew where low was I wouldn't be here
Everything is on sale I see
Why is Barrick gold the worst stock in the history of stocks? Literally never moves!!
Early in the year it was way OTM puts dates about a month or 2 out, then I learned about FDs and lost a lot and made some back, now I try and stick with leaps unless I hear news of something lol.
Can you put calls on that ass 24/7? I don't think so.
BB is mooning I think
Seems like it has done this most of the past week
Idk but my heart can’t take much more 😭
If every impulse you have is wrong, then the opposite is bound to be right.
I sold nio at 44$ after holding for the past month thinking this shit is going to just trade sideways. After I sel it’s up 15% in 2 days. Fuck my life fuck me fuck stocks
Buying SOXL at $69 was the best decision of my life

Nio - price targets upgraded to 59 by BAC and Goldman.   NIO hiring in Norway and will be selling in the EU.  NIO day coming up in January.   Catalysts?  check check check. Obligatory to the moon.
I think there’s a typo. I think he meant to spell DMT (which he might be on) with the first letter of each sentence. So I think he meant to say “Mo escaping” for the second line.
I got in gme calls at the bottom and it went up and I’m down $40 coool
$AMZN needs to hold and rip upwards today. You can do it algos.
Lots of weak hands here on PLTR
The fomo on it today is gonna be wild
Bitch I got 1/15 30c and 35c's.
Fuck. NIO better be at a pretty penny by Jan 15
It’ll be ok fellas. Crack a beer and take a bubble bath with the boys tonight and forget the world

Fuk these kak sakahs, im buying leaps
MARA at a nice price volume is up
but it runs on batteries

Oh fuck okay
Some dumb ass could of made a fuck ton of money if he would of just held on the TSLA calls... instead he bought fucking Pinterest........Pinterest....

Imagine being green for the year and losing all of your profits on the last day of the year
Nio day coming up. Dont' get it twisted. 1/15 60c
BABA why is you like that
I like the pullback to 134, and I think there's room to run up until earnings.  Iphone 12 & apple watch sales will be strong.  I'm expecting them to be hitting on all cylinders operationally in 2022, with growth opportunities in services developing more.  I'm excited to see what the M2 chips look like.  I don't really care much about the ev announcement.
Need a day trade. Whats a good buy?
Keep in mind most of WSB drool from the mouth and their only DD is looking at daily threads
$APHA has shattered my heart, and my bank account. I TRUSTED YOU
Same but I’m happy with my $80 profit lol (just lost it all at open) 🙃
PLTR is a piece of dogshit. Buy it when it’s at $15 in a few months.

Puts on Nikola
Whoa, easy guy. I was only talking about my Roth IRA. No way I'm gonna sell the 700k worth of TSLA right now. I usually just sell covered calls against those shares.
?????? 2k into all Americans are democrats rich friends?????? Did I read that correctly or am I retarded
$MAXR is the stock we all wished $SPCE would be.

You’re supposed to buy low

PLTR 24.5c 1/29/21
Big time
Where my FCEL retards at? You ready to go back to 13?
Stic or Thic?
[deleted]
while I'm happy PLTR is decreasing in price for a better price point... I don't think this reflects PLTRs quality, just things like ARK selling and end of year profit taking
I've always felt the big players were going to try to screw anybody with a 25 or higher call by the end of the year. We'll see what happens... Pleas fly
[deleted]
Stic or Thi?
Everyone shut the fuck up and give TSLA your power!!!!
ITS WAR DAY MOFOS! LETS SQUEEZE THEM AND STAND STRONG! GME GANG ITS BUY TIME

Im just glad my gains from Tesla shares this year has offset the money lost on PLTR calls.
Which is already better than most new American EV companies.
New year sex is ruined

So glad I bought that TSLA dip
up 500% on a 1dte nio 47.5 lotto i bought yesterday for 30 bucks. what a way to end this shithole of a year
Mostly red.
This war for WISH is fun to watch
FUCKING BLOOD RED LMFAO
Good to know, thanks
Amd fucked me hard a few months back, they disgust me when I look their way
20,000
Because it has been consistently beating the index. Hell, if we look at the last two years alone, there are very few companies it hasn't beaten, including friggin' *TSLA*.

Funny thing is, I've been in the solar industry for over a decade, and prefer SEDG - but at this point, I just keep buying both, and it just keeps working.

Once SPY breaks $371 we gonna bleed quick
what’s it look like
Wow these last 2 weeks have been absolutely terrible for me
Hmm, to sell my GOEV calls for nearly a 1K loss and benefit taxes this year, or hold on the hopes it pops up by the 15th
Copped another contract... these day trades too easy
Starting to look like this is bs.
Full red day
I keep hearing that... Interesting thanks. What's your strike and position?
People will be realizing gains on the 4th. Defer taxes for another year
Full
thank youuh
I guess I shouldn’t have sold my NIO calls to break even yesterday huh 😐
Guh

Got out of NIO wayyyy to early. Had a handful of 46c I dumped yesterday.

back to NIO...
Yea Ihor explains it, could go on forever in theory

Edit misread that. It would shift the lending pool but only have a catastrophic effect if done en masse, e.g. share recalls
This used to be fun
3-5 years
If TSLA acquired Canoo how good or bad would that be?
Can we get much gayer
Fuck it I’m going to make it a habit to buy at the point of maximum pessimism. I just said GOEV was the worst stock I’ve ever bought but I’ll buy another $5k worth right now
Alright I’m saying it steel gang is dead
Its sad how mad I am that the market is closed tomorrow.  Getting sick of these short weeks. I guess Im getting old.
Die everything! DIE!

Let's make a real dip to buy back in.

I could have gotten one at no cost. But

2. Not billable
3. Learning curve 
4.  Easy for it to disappear
5. Got to charge it

Not a must have game changer. 

Younger generations may think differently.
Buy the dip

I was a pretty big power rangers fan, I’ve seen this movie many times. It’s pretty good still but the specials effects and graphics did not age well. Saw it 7 years ago and thought it was pretty good, saw it again this year and it was pretty clear how badly it aged. 

Also your portfolio is missing PLTR 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀

As to the value, I pulled it from Yahoo finance but it may be a bit outdated. Just search GME short interest and check the sources
At this point I’m holding PLTR to expiry and hope that something big happens with the interview and showcase day.
Man I’m thinking the same thing idk

Welp BABA gave me my free winner on my return to robinhood yesterday and now I'm back to being dogshit at trading. Yay.

Wasted a month holding palantir for it to do nothing but trend fucking downwards

why do I feel like markets are way more volatile when they open these days
#NIO GOD MODE
SO UNAMERICAN!
Don’t forget guys market close at 9:45am EST because of the holiday.
Damn that was quite a fakeout
*Sense of Urgency* Only if you invest today. $AGNC is at a -20% discount from February 2020 levels. Soon you’ll have to invest 200,000 to draw minimum wage from dividends. 

On a side note I think it’s 50¢ above minimum.
Also if you had the money and burned it at a rate it’s about 10.8 years of sustained living at minimum wage. Otherwise it’s that rate as long as you hold the stock.
Who has all this money to spend on paid Emojis????

**TLDR** $14 / $15 is too cheap for GOEV and HF were taking profits and de risking EOY. With January new money and new risk appetite + new B2B announcements it will 🚀🚀🚀 above $20 sometime in Q1

Google is a great company but they are simply too expensive. It's 5 years now since they restructured their business to seperate Google from other bets. Those still make up about only 0,5% of total revenues. It almost seems like a joke. There is basically no additional information in this restructuring whatsoever. Sure, they have some nice technologies in development but will those move the needle? Why try to make money in a company that is already over 1 trill and is getting fucked left and right for antitrust violations? Anyway, it's about time they are getting clapped. Just one example many don't know is how google discriminates third party online advertising trading desks and exchanges (there is a whole paper on this). I don't think they will be broken up, but I don't think the risks are already reflected in the stock price. Do an intrinsic valuation and you will see that the market is still optimistic about the stock. I wouldn't be surprised if the stock tanks when news about the antitrust lawsuits in china and the US hit. 


Tldr: google had a monopoly for too long and is about to get clapped, it's too early to get in
How do you lose money in this market....

Don't worry, this professional WSB Technical Analyst says PLTR is going to $10,000, all you have to do is wait 100 years 🤡🤡
Completely avoids the point of viral load that this is about.

I sometimes question myself if I’m retarded or not
Tsla makes no sense
PLTR has to be the worst stock mentioned on this sub

White collar job loss is where it gets scary
I had a nightmare last night where I was in a hotel lobby with Nancy Pelosi.

She was exposing to me her big honkers and told me "if you wanna squeeze em you gotta vote Democrat". I held out as long as I could but by the end of the dream I cast a down ballot Dem vote. 

After? She started cackling and disappeared into the hotel elevator before I could grab her honkers.
I thought PLTR was supposed to make us rich!!!🥲

Started the year at 100k, dipped down 79k in March.  Finishing the year at 144k.  

Big gains from holding aapl amzn dis crm.  

Big L’s from oxy and xom 

I just started options a month ago so no gains there.
I’m switching to playing prysmian group stock on the LSE
So people like you are what paid for my crack binge last night. Glad to meet the losing side
Yeah.  My wife and I don't file jointly so I'm guessing she got two of the kids.  I make over $75k so I didn't get anything.  Oh well, I'm not too worried about it.  If my accountant says I should get it then I'll get it when I file my taxes.  I didn't get any of the last stimulus at all (I should've).

Why
Idk, I see lots of posts about retailers loving this company and are overall disappointed by where we are today. I think it’s more to do with MM manipulation and retailers absolutely panicking at that huge drop we had at ticker change. Also lack of PR atm.
It doesn’t look promising but hope it does. 

BBBY did print tendies earlier this year but not sure about this one. I would say some time in January/February to shoot back up.

Look I’d say it’s a 50 50 chance you end up in the money. Once it gets more in the spotlight it will rally and maybe rally hard. Plus they already have B2B partnerships signed and they are waiting Q1 to reveal them. Now are they going to say something in the first 2 weeks of January? Or will a bank start covering in the meantime? (Only one small analyst has published Buy rating with $30 target so far).

Trying to realize some losses today for the tax deduction 📉🥳
Apparently not
Started in March buying NCLH and UAL shares dirt cheap.  Flipped them higher in May/June before second wave hit.  Reinvested in some REITs and watch ed it gain like a savings account, finally jumped into small cap oil and made good returns in November.  I was over 100% profit at this point.  Found WSB and options trading and went downhill from there.

I’m up about 60% now but have continued to add cash.  Honestly I’ve lost some money the past few weeks just figuring out options and making some bad decisions but I think that’s part of the learning process.  As retarded as this place is I’ve learned a lot about the broader market here.

EDIT:  I’ve had a lot of downtime this year and “don’t trade because you’re bored” has been a hard lesson.

I need something that is as much like Google Colab as possible to run our bots on. Typically I just write a .py file and run it with supervisor on a VPS, but needing a GPU means I can't use digitalocean.

I don't have any experience with things like AWS so I don't know one product from the other. What is the most like a Colab notebook? I don't wanna have to re-write shit.
All in on BA

what should i YOLO in to at open
Only 3k of loss. Gains and losses offset each other until you have more losses than 3k, then its only 3k a year for however big the loss lol
Probably like 5m. We’re talking enough to weather bad years and bad returns while still letting me dick around without worry. Something like 2m would require me to make decent returns every year just to sustain a good income

PLTR boutta crash at open
lol k
Can I get a reward too?
This company seems to have a solid foundation but the public sentiment has battered this company to submission. Investors and retail investors alike see the non-fashionable and clunky end product and were ultimately not pleased. Jay Leno’s garage on Canoo was probably one of the most awkward company tours I’ve seen.  The only hope here is good solid partnerships and hopefully a total rehaul of their top-hat designs.  Hope you weather this storm but this company will need more to standout from the dilution of start-up EVs.

Yes, shorting and anything that generates profits off of a stonk going down is gay. Shorting is extremely fucking gay though, just look at Citron. Selling calls is the only acceptable gay action as it's more akin to being a fan of JJBA than being an outright cock connoisseur

we go where the people are, even if the features of that platform are shit.
I have no problem with people moving forward and learning from mistakes. 
I have a problem when the DNC forces wishy washy politicians on its own supporters, especially when they give them a *wink*, and say they are the party of pro black people. Biden and Harris have a horrid track record of throwing black people into the institutional prison system that’s meant to keep a large portion of minorities down. It’s hypocritical, and BS. If the DNC was the party of progressives, no, they wouldn’t have shoved the Biden/Harris campaign down our throats and expected us to thank them. Yes, they aren’t trump, but they aren’t angels either. 
And don’t vie me the “it was the law” crap. Look up the history of drug laws, and most of it was to control black Americans through the 60s-90s.
If my covered calls go in the money at open can I sell my shares right away at that price, or do I need to wait for the buyer to call my shares away from me later in the day?
it stopped itself
Nervous poops
Is GME just another pyramid scheme you fucks
Can't stop, won't stop, Gamestop.
Trading 9:30 ~ 9:45 then heading to the gym. All my remaining contracts are 5 months out and shares. Just blocked some crazy girl on my phone (gave great BJ’s but that crazy was not safe). Going to bed early tonight! Good luck to all my WSB G’s

But what did you put them on?
Flatter than my 6th grade gf
let me be the one to shit on this since no one else has. you have learned nothing from your losses, which I assume you got from credit spreads too? Credit spreads are a winning strategy but there are times when you don’t even have an opportunity to cut your losses on a losing trade. If you’re dumping 60% of your account in each trade, you are putting yourself in a real risk for losing all 60%. 

I’ve been doing this for a long ass time and I’ve also been burned because of overleveraging. Limit your positions to 10%, which is already extremely aggressive with spreads. And I don’t mean “oh ill diversify 10% on amd put credit spreads and 10% on nvda put credit spreads”. Keep 90% of your account as CASH. When we hit the next correction forget about the 10% you just lost and switch to writing puts on decimated, but strong sectors and eventually spy or aapl leaps. If you kept your account as mostly cash you’d be able to pick up very good deals.
Guys TODAY IS A REGULAR TRADING DAY, markets open until 4PM you retards.

You're confusing the entertainment industry for the finance industry.
If you try and use any type of day trading strategy you will fuck yourself so hard and end up losing so much money. If you’re a beginner never listen to any of those guys like Ricky Gutierrez or Tim Sykes. Ricky Guitierrez has me blocked because I made fun of his bench press.

Unpopular opinion: if you guys bought stock instead of options the puts and shorts wouldn’t have as much incentive to drag pltr through the mud.
Good, people shouldn't be working pointless do nothing busywork jobs
This kind of rhetoric is too simple, which actually leads to making the bubble more obvious, which makes it actually not po, because it would be too obvious. I wonder how this TSLA-thing will wound up.

Also, as an avid coffee drinker; the taste was altered temporarily for me once I started to recover. It took a good while before things went back to normal.

So shorting is gay? Me confused
The real reason to short Tesla is their own CEO does not care much about the company and is seemingly not incentivized to do better. 
Forget about financials, if the companies management is not clearly motivated and well-rounded, I want nothing to do with it as an investment.

He said in a 60 minutes interview:
 “If somebody comes and makes a better electric car than Tesla, and it’s so much better than ours that we can’t sell our cars and we go bankrupt, I still think that’s a good thing for the world.”

I understand his sentiment and its a great attitude, but I don't want my money tied up in that lolol

Can confirm, sitting on my 1,000 shares and having sticky poops as well.
I’m expecting a small correction today, so I sold my calls at close yesterday. Probably gonna get some more after a dip if there is one today. If there isn’t, oh well 🤷‍♂️
I’m rolling deep in puts various strikes between Jan and May. I’m still a bit unclear on this next lockup expiration before March. The language in the S1 is quite obscure. It sounds like end of December but other sources online I’ve found have referenced Jan 4-7. 
What do you think?
Normally I'm all about waiting but not sure if that's good idea with this one. Got 25k order for 2.80 as I type this
He’s also [streaming](https://www.twitch.tv/wsbmod). Worth watching to appreciate his efforts even more.
who would have thought this post cant go tits up 🤣
I thought buying AAPL calls one month before it’s earnings was smart. Apparently not. 🤡
Yes sir!!! Got 14k at .3
Sure. That math works
Oh good, another one

If you start researching about the company, yo will understand, that the p/e is a misleading number considering the actual valuation.

A prosecutor enforcing the current laws then turning the tide when she realizes the error in the laws as they were written. I can’t stand when people are anti logic or anti science and think new data shouldn’t change your views. Wear that sht like a badge, be proud to change your views, don’t shame people for doing so. Who cares what someone’s views were yesterday. Weed should be legal, if alcohol, cigarettes, guns, and pain killers can be legal, why not a marijuana brownie or CBD drink? Republicans trust you with loaded guns, but not a joint. Old world thinking. Bravo to her for pointing it out,...and instead you want to focus on yesterday

Oh god that’s a haunting scenario. And you’re so right
$12 a year. Let’s take T for example, they pay $2 roughly per year, so my mans has 6 shares of T as his entire portfolio. That’s like $180. My dude needs to figure out how to make some money before he gets all crazy about cOmPoUnDiNg InTeReSt...
Why do you guys feel GME is going any where? Digitizing of games is a serious dent. Console sales are competitive. I would rather buy and hold the HERO etf. Let me know your motivation!
yea i deleted my comment cause i was retarded. for a moment i forgot im in southeast asia singapore

Wow way to fuck that up
if this doesnt inspire anyone to buy GME nothing will 🚀🚀🚀
I prefer doing the wrecking tbh.
You know why they sold off?
Might as well buy shares, that's what I did.   
Any more discount and I double down.
Fuck it I’m in take my money🚀
I’m long shares 17.08 average. What’s your strike and expiry? 

My view is that the stock got too much beating because of the HF unloading (as they got units for $10 each including 1 share and 1 warrant 1-for-1 ratio) but retail investors and mid long term investors believe in the company plans.

I expect the stock to trade above $20 in Q1. 25.00 is a big resistance because it’s a milestone for unlocking the second tranche of Earnout Shares for management. When it breaks 25.00 FOMO will kick in and you could see big swings.
also can’t go up forever

Re: TSLA put

By 2023, all the free money ($1.1B Euro) selling credits to FCA will stop \[1\].  That's just one stream.  Remember the greens credits are free money for TSLA which juices bottom line (operating cash flow).  But once it stops TSLA business model implodes.

It can be sooner depending on how well VW ID4 and Rivian sales do in 2021.  But by 2023,  TSLA will be ded.

Don't really see explosive growth in pot soon
Buy the dip
First off I’m also retarded so take my opinion with a grain of salt, but I would say using margin to buy shares and sell CCs is still a covered call because your max risk is still 100x the share price, where as a naked call as unlimited risk

If excercised you will sell the shares at whatever Strike price you sold the call at. 

As the other redditor pointed out, you bought the shares on margin. Generally you don't want anything long term on margin because the interest rate will be higher then the return you get.

Ya’ll so fucking autistic you all broke the spectrum

You just answered your own question, and no I didn't downvote you. Your time scale is too short. Don't look at the stock in terms of half a year, look at it in terms of console cycles. 30 is priced in for 4th quarter earnings on a record breaking console cycle.

Yes women do this all the time, they either hold their mirror and steering wheel with the same hand or use the in car mirror. Look I’m all for Tesla and think it’s a great company, but women doing makeup isn’t a reason to get excited about the future performance of the company.

Happy cake day you worthless degenerate
Everyone here just pisses money down the toilet, but occasionally some lucky fucker wins big and pretends that they know what they're doing.

I'm confused how it's not covered? If it got exercised how would it be any different than usual?

I somehow managed to be down -15% YtD during the greatest bull run in history.

A performance in itself I suppose. One I might even enjoy, had I not been money-sensitive.
What?
Not 100% sure what you mean, I am new to this sub.

I guess, I am Holding for now
Nobody tell him
Dude. I know it well. 10+ years ago they were pushing it locally to the restaurant I worked in. Shit was labeled a “weight loss drink”. Hated the taste. Now they bring in big players and relabel as an “energy drink”. 

I sold my calls earlier in the week too. Crying about this one. 😭
You’re absolutely wrong

Swung a risky as hell tesla 700 zero day call. What is the move? Sell right at open?

I was born on 4/20/1999. 🧢
Employees generally don't like to have frozen remunaration they can't access... it's a normal practice to incentivize long term vision towards the success of the company.

Some people at Google/Alphabet or Facebook despise the company too and don't want shares I can tell you that, but it doesn't make it a bad investment.

But you are right that the slump of the past few years is concerning, I'm holding right now because I'm confident it's undervalued and has momentum, but I will take out profits in 2021 just in case it goes back to being China's Yahoo in the future.
Sooo it's not to late to jump in?

even funnier is that none of the GME gang has considered the possibility that he might need to sell some or all of his GME position to deal with that shit.  Doesn't he own a fuck-ton of GME?

isn’t this how tax loss harvesting is possible? similar concept but opposite?
All calls EOD
Contrary to popular opinion, pltr is range bound for the foreseeable. Buy in the 25s, sell in the 28s...rinse and repeat. 

Do this while holding some leaps for 2022-2023 in case of breakout. 

This stock had the potential to be stuck at 30 for a very long time. Also has the potential to inexplicably go to $100. You're going to want to keep skin in the game while skimming. If you don't want to do poor man's covered calls, then just swing it again and again and again
stop im already out of cum and it hurts
Fuck is going on here
no effect

people in that position typically don't have mortgages. they're also not going to be doing too much shopping besides food and clothing

there might be a lot of homeless who would eventually wind up dead. problem solved

reality is they don't have that much of an impact on the economy, and it's going to get worse for people at the bottom when autonomous driving and robotics take hold

truck drivers, servers, retail staff, all gone. anything low-skill and algorithmic will be finished

Agree.

Letting them do what they want is just not feasible, and I think it will get worse before it gets better.

STIMULUS NEWS COMING OUT AT 9:35AM MAJOR PUMP INCOMING 
source: my calls that need all the help they can get
PPL, don't understand TSLA business model.  Even as the EV adoption pie grows, it means Big Auto don't need to pay TSLA for green credits.  TSLA is only profitable off EV credits and not selling cars.  So even though they are selling more, if Big Auto is also selling lots of EV, TSLA can't sell EV credits and they'll return to negative operating cash flow.

You won't see this on the balance sheet until end of '21.  But be forewarned that the TSLA bubble pop is coming in '21.  Not sure if it'll be mid '21 or end '21 but it is coming.

There's 3 minutes of my life I'll never get back.
Looking for ideas to take advantage of the impending rate hikes. Any thoughts?
It is already $700 my guy
you gotta take gains. I always trade a minimum 4 contracts of something and set stop losses for 1 or 2, and then let the other 2 ride and try and hit that 1000%. Usually I take 75%, 150%, 300%, and let the rest ride.

Is it 1 in a mil or is there a method to learn?
Sorry for being retarded 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Thoughts on BIDU puts at open? Looks like it was way over bought
Actual, honest to God tried and true advice:

Answer the phone the next time one of your collectors calls. Be friendly and humble. Tell them the truth: you are but a humble options trader and thus have no money. Nothing from nothing is nothing. Ask what you could do to have the account marked as paid instead of settled. I got a major credit card company to basically wipe away 10k in debt. I paid them a fraction of what was owed and they called it good. Tried it with a couple friends over the years with the same results. Good luck!

P.s--also offer to perform phone sex as a thank you
which one performs better over the next 6 months?

silver or gold?

or the asset that shall not be named?
Damn the ark dividends were pretty nice
Everyone loses in the end with socialism
What is required is a catalyst to solidify GME as a buy, which is what those of us with skin in the game are anticipating with RC. Once this happens, supply will drop and the rockets are a go 🚀🚀🚀

I have a hundred but trying to decide what to do. Saw the run up to 27 but a 15-20% decline the past two days isn't sitting too well.
Mostly the run up on Tesla. I was long on Tesla shares until papa Elon tweeted and I took his advice. Avg price 240. Sold at 700 😭

Oh ya. Should also add. Financial and annual reports don't mean shit in 2020. After first half of 2020, I just used the finest DD on WSB.

PLTR, CRSR, XPEV, NIO. Meme stocks saved the portfolio lol. Tripled on XPEV, doubled on PLTR, NIO, CRSR.

You probably were trying to apply in the not too distant past when spreads in an IRA required a paper form to be submitted. If you try again now, you can ask for spreads within the options app on the web.

Their Haliade-X Wind Turbine - https://www.ge.com/renewableenergy/wind-energy/offshore-wind/haliade-x-offshore-turbine - is supposed to be a big leap forward.
3k -> 10k -> 2$ 

Had a call on zoom when it exploded after its insane earnings and 
 shorted nikola when the Hindenburg report came out. 

Straight Ls after that
Why do I even like pussy it’s stinky
Yeah I keep thinking I will see an opportunity and I have not. I could very well miss the drop but I am planning on being very careful about it before entering a position.
Latom
Gonna be another slow day
And if you click on “all” you’re down from 300k
I agree but a flat repeal on section 230 would be kinda insane. Needs to be reformed and lay out what twitter and facebook need to do
You mean Bulls? Bears want to see the market go down.
LMND has much larger TAM and better management team imo
Hey so I don’t think we’ll be out of the clear with this whole thing until 2023. I was up all night doing research and here is what I found out. 

2021 is pronounced as “2020 won” 
2022 is pronounced as “2020 too”

It’s going to be a long couple years folks. Be safe.
You got the Tesla call for today?
Market doesn't close early stop spreading misinformation
My deposit clears today. Give me another dip. My only hesitation is GME was 69% of my portfolio and now it's gonna be ruined when I buy more 🚀
This changed, can just apply for spreads within the options app on the website instead of having to do that spread agreement by paper

Right here
This but unironically
Every day the two biggest liquidity events happen on the open and on the close. (AKA Opening auction and closing auction) this happens every morning and is similar to an IPO where we have a price discovery process to find what price the stock should open at. Except instead of an IPO, we are taking all buy side and sell side interest to determine what price the stock should open at today.

 If you had a really large position in a stock you wanted to unload, your best bet would be to buy/sell those shares on the open or the close. Why? Because that’s just what everybody does these days to avoid getting pennied/having algos run the price of the stock up/down against you intraday.

For example: let’s say you wanted to buy 100k shares of PLTR. You can throw in an order at 9am to buy 100k shares at the open limited to a certain price, or at the market. This order is now publicly displayed and within those 30 minutes before the open chances are you might find someone that’s willing to SELL you 100k shares of PLTR. The 100k shares can come from 1 seller or it can come from many different sellers all totaling 100k. The stock is now paired off and it opens on 100k shares of total volume. I buy my 100,000 shares I’m happy, and someone (or multiple people) who wanted to sell 100,000 shares is happy. Now the stock continues to trade intraday.  The same process happens at the close. Keep in mind it might not just be you who wants to buy 100k, a few others might want to buy 100k too, some people might also just want to be a percentage of the opening volume, so if total volume is 200k shares they might want to buy 10% of the opening volume (20k shares) etc. We all do the same thing hunting for buyers/sellers and that’s how we end up getting that one big “block trade” at the open and on the close. It’s just buyers and sellers trading with eachother that end up determining the opening (or closing) price of the stock for the day. 

If I were to try to buy 100,000 shares of PLTR intraday it wouldn’t be as easy. Algos can read when a certain person is constantly buying/selling stock. So they will quickly pull their offers and make you pay up, or they might even try to penny you and buy along side you. if you put a bid in at 25.10 it will jump in front of you and put a bid at 25.11. This will end up costing you more money since you will end up pushing the price of the stock up on yourself making your average price worse. The same exact thing happens on the close, people who want to buy/sell large amounts of stock will hunt for liquidity on the closing auction. You take all the volume of those closing orders, and boom, that’s how you get the closing price and how you get that one last “big trade” after 4:00.

My friend is down 40% on his shares, he almost timed the peak perfectly. I was thinking of grabbing some shares this morning since it’s down 50% from last Tuesday. Smart or nah?

Just wait
Didnt mean to come off like a condescending dick. I just understand what you're saying exactly.

I used to hate conservatives. I was convinced they were all heartless and evil. But thats mostly because I only ever heard Democrats describe and explain them. I really made an effort to understand where they were coming from - to get at the foundational principals behind their opinions, and I have a much better understanding and appreciation for their ideas now. I still mostly disagree, but I learned that we really all want the same things, we just have different ideas on the best way to get there.

Seems like I have some more research to do huh
No, I don't
Take any PLTR profits and roll into GME - PLTR go down, GME go up!!!!
Have you considered that a lot of the volume is just short sellers selling to each other in service of manipulating the price?

What was he mad about this time
Read more books, good books, and get to know yourself better. If you do this correctly you’ll figure out that there are things you don’t like that are probably necessary in society, and what those end up being for you will help lend some direction. Personally, I think the existing parties are poorly representative of the popular will and we are ripe for a third position takeover. 

Oh yeah, long GME shares.
trading at over 60 times revenue. You know they’d have to grow 50% /year for over a decade to even start justifying that valuation?
I started working full-time about six years ago and I've felt burnt out and done for about three years, is this normal? I literally dream about retiring every day and I'm not that old yet.
Ahh now if you don’t recall...NIO did this nearly every PM on its ride up. 

It then typically rallied intraday.
Elon?
lmao FUBO.  Woof
He has done this for years - it’s great.  They keep doing these because people tune in and talk about it online, he is great for exposure.  He is also very careful with his words, a true pro.  Should be on Broadway.
This guy definitely shops at GameStop.
This market isn't working right. Someone try turning it off and turning it on again.

Stop being a downer and up that GME.
Why is tesla IV between 50-70% ? The stock literally moves like a penny stock. It shoukd always be above 100%
Not like this NIO, get the fuck back up there you cunt

usually when i make a good point on a non meme stonk i'll get a message or 2.
I made money on they way up. I now have 50k in March puts on PLTR. I'll buy again after lockup period drop

Is today the day for WISH?
What is this?
It’s not bad, considering TSLA is the top holding at 10%
2020 rally today
Agree. Total return investing in vtsax or vtwax is superior to dividend investing because you have the ability to adjust your withdrawal based on inflation. Dividend payouts can look attractive at first, but without growth over a long period of time inflation basically just eats up all the value from the dividend payouts.

For the growth phase, I’m 80% vtwax and 20% wsb plays.

When I’m done working, I’ll be 50% vtwax/bonds (70/30 split) with a 3-4% withdrawal rate and 50% index wheeling on 1.2-1.5x leverage with margin.

Dividends are for losers.
rip bruuther
My $175 price target for baba still stands
Hold GILD, they might be bought out and let´s be serious they are worth more than 55$
you can't fight the liquidity pump into this market.

The jobless claims over the last few month (since reopening) have been as bad as they were during the Great Financial Crisis.

The expectation is that once vaccine rolls out, everyone will be hired back, which the data did support when we reopened.

The market is high on free money.  Don't try to fight it.  The only way to fight it is when inflation hits 2.5% and the Fed will start considering interest hikes. That's still 1.5 years away.
I woke up to just read, now I must hop on this train
When you’re YOLOing Tesla FDs, you aren’t thinking responsibly lol.  Ahh well, I’ll use that big stimmy to cover some of those taxes and offset it with my nice huge Netflix loss playing their earnings in the summer 😂😂

BABA.
It has been absolutely killing it, I regret selling the shares I bought at 3ish. Got back in around 7 and averaged up some. Don't know if today will keep this trajectory or if we'll take profits though.

not that complicated, right?
!remindme 6 months
I'm up 42.6% on the year thanks almost entirely to NIO and DIS. Biggest losers for me this year were ACB (I'm an idiot) and ARKG (yes, I'm one of the only boners to have lost money on ARKG this year). Currently long on ARKG and ARKF.
Never trust the unemployment numbers. It's always too low
lol same, made 1m this year and still eligible for the yummy stimulus coming my way. also, started my trading business so i'm writing off hella expenses. Chinese btw.
If your gains are no longer gains... they aren’t gains
You have to add retards at the end so they know you’re talking to them. Otherwise they’ll yolo go Jan calls

They’re at the bottom cause they fucked up or are lazy. Everyone who worked hard has a good job is fine
Every sale is a taxable event. Hope you put some money aside
Dear diary. Day 7, no shower. Might change that soon. Lost all moneys thanks to WSB fgts. This year will be worse.
But I can only report up to 3k.  So at some points I realized over 25k in profit even though my account is actually only 20 bucks up to end the year.  Seems unfair.

The regulators have definitely been more accommodating, but the accelerated timelines by all the companies developing vaccines is more to do with them running studies in parallel at risk as opposed to the historical approach with running studies in series. Also manufacturing the vaccine at risk before data is generated on the safety / efficacy has helped considerably to speed up the process. This has been made possible because of state funding. BARDA in the case of the Moderna / BioNtech Pfizer vaccines and the UK Government in the case of the Oxford / AZ vaccine.
I already have GME shares I’m commenting just to be apart of this legendary post
there’s lots of boomers who watch cnbc and eat that shit up. Him and Kernan are going nowhere

Where do people think this money is coming from?
Yes

If you have Think or Swim, you can watch it for free on the home page. At least that's the case in the US, not sure if it works the same overseas
Reddit awards are so affordable. We need to buy low and sell when the awards go up.

My cheeks are ready, let’s get it done
Has been a pyscho boomer for years
Capital gains tax reporting confuses me.  Do I have to report all sales even if I lost it the same day and/or reinvested?  I’ve had 2 instances of making over 10k in options but have proceeded to lose it all.
Closing in on 10 months since covid lockdowns. Nearly 800k first time unemployed. America is a shitshow
yeah i shoulda put 'racking up debt'
I think we already saw the handle last week on the pullback after the failed breakout. I think it will be an uptrend from here. That being said, after 10-week moving average yesterday and nearly touching down on its 50-day line for the first time in months, Nio stock is now 8.5% above its 10-week line, still actionable. It's also broken above a downward-sloping trend line, offering another early entry.
Sell at 708-712 early morning and don’t look back.
Don't compare yourself to people you see on social media.
For no reason

Give shots 24 hours a day. Give some to frontline, but the rest based on age to anyone who wants it. Use them as soon as they arrive. 

 Blast the locations on tv. Anyone over age 75 can get a vaccine at this list of locations. In a few weeks lower the age cutoff to 65.

God damn we're incompetent. We deserve another bear market.

Bad faith actors. They also talk about the importance of lower taxes but when Americans need tax money back in the form of a tax refund (stimulus), they're against that kind of tax cut (the one for people who need it for call options!)
Hmmm but TA looks super bullish

Well it’s not as bad as it seems. The fed gov will still reimburse employers that provide paid sick leave but they’re just no longer required to. Still have to provide unpaid sick leave at least. So basically if your employer is an asshole you won’t get paid when you’re out. Most other probably will still pay tho because it costs them very little.

I'll never get the sudden obsession with GME. It was a shit stock years ago when it was in the 30's. Company is going nowhere. Financials are depressing. Stores look forgotten. Their inventory is confusing and marketing non existent. They blew it a long time ago and I don't think they can come back from it without such a radical shift in plan that would take a decade to re-establish.
It's  MAAM

Is it one person handing out all awards? Can you actually see who gave you the award? 

Y'all don't put on your tinfoil hats just yet, I think WSBgod is back
We all are
normally I agree with you but if you look at the five-year chart even some of these high dividend paying stocks  had retarded runs
if Europe, North America, and the good bits of Asia get a social credit system à la China, palantir made it.

Also, if we get pre-crime, the minority report shit but with data, they are making it too.

So think about it, if we get the SCS but you put enough money on their stock, at least you will be able to afford the good perks.

+17700 on 3300 initial investment in July in my Robinhood gambling account. Cashed out 10k and now playing with house money. Most losses are tech stocks with 2-3 week expiry. Most gains are tech and weed stocks with 2-3 week expiry. Apple was my single best and single worst option this year. I bought one just before the recent run up that did +720% before I sold. Also bought right before the previous ATH in September that dropped to less than 10% of purchase price in a day. 

My more conservative IRA and 401k are +22% and +13% this year.

1billion dollar idea: buy shares with awards. That would be awesome
Fuck yeah I see the 600 pending deposit but for Jan 4th. Can't play today :(

That is also why NIO has a $70B+ market cap, and GOEV has a <$4B market cap. GOEV will get to $8B market cap, before NIO gets to $140B.

Hey dad/brother/friend, it's me, the long lost person you've been looking for. :)

That’s true. Lucky for me the closest option I have expires the end of Jan. The rest are a month out. Thinking of loading up more money today and see if I can buy some shares
Call in and ask for an appointment with Strategy Desk, and/or go the the Learning Center and check out the live webinars. There's an Options for Beginners course and Group Coaching Sessions that I think could both help you out.

With that said, you're referring to the Options Summary page?

The page shows you how your options strategies are paired up, and any unpaired shares.

The "averaged cost" is your cost basis; the credit or debit you paid or received when you opened the position.

Change since purchase is how much the bid (if it's a net dr basis) or ask (if cr) has moved since you opened the position.

Current values show you the current bid/ask.

Market value shows you how much you would have to pay to buy back at the ask OR how much you would receive on a sell at the bid if you were to close the position at the posted bid/ask. Market value netted against averaged cost = change since purchase.

That should be all you need to know for that page.
That PnL thread is depressing as fuck.  What the fuck was I doing all year.
PLTR declared bankcruptcy... for put buyers
Good to know it’s possible to get past it at least
if you have a margin account on RH you agree to allow RH to lend out shares you own. by default this is all RH accounts that are not cash accounts. Its kinda scummy because you don't get a "cut" of the profits RH makes. Other trading platforms give you a cut of the interest they receive from your shares.

At what time of day?
I had a couple hundred that was freed up after I sold some options so I just bought a few shares of Pfizer to hold overnight but it’s been like two weeks because it won’t go up at all and instead drifts down slowly
You ever see science fiction movies, it’s basically the software behind the interface in spaceships/other shit with huds
It’s more than delivery targets.

- Business Insider dropped a lengthy interview with Elon last night that calls out a ton. One being that he guaranteed (100% certain) that Tesla would have Level 5 autonomous driving next year.
- Also, say your job is to beat the S&P 500 (Active Fund Managers), but you didn’t buy Tesla at inclusion. Now you’re watching it go past it’s inclusion price. Wouldn’t you want your Tesla position to be equal weight to the index?

Personally though, I think this is just one last pump before Tesla sells off a bit on Monday after delivery numbers are released.
Im hunched over my desk and drinking coffee.

+107% YTD and I started trading the end of October. 21K gain. 

Positions are shares in TSLA / SQ / PLTR / LMND / ABNB. 

ETFs in my boomer brokerage that I set and forget: ARKK / ARG / ICLN. 

Best option gains were leaps and leaps only - RIOT and PLUG.

Biggest thing I learned was to fight the urge to make a move every single day, which I’m still struggling with. Sometimes no move is the best move. Lost a lot of money this way, could’ve been up 130% at least.

It’s just like the one jackoff at the Craps table putting his chips on the Don’t Pass line.
Sure, once the merger takes places anything could happen. But if you are not confident on the target and stock hasn't taken off, just switch to another spac.

MW Apple's iPhone 12 sales exceed Wedbush's 'bull case scenario,' expected to boost stock

12/31/20, 1:16 PM
Sales of Apple Inc.'s iPhone 12 have exceeded Wedbush's "bull case scenario" for fiscal 2021, based on Asia supply chain checks, and should boost shares with December results coming shortly, analyst Dan Ives wrote in a note Thursday. " We believe Apple saw a robust Christmas/holiday season not just on iPhones, but also had a strong AirPods performance that will be another product tailwind heading into 2021 for Cook & Co," Ives wrote.

yeah the poor man's covered call is a great way to do this since it lowers the cost of getting into a position . you don't need balls if you just buy the right leaps- pick a good delta around .7 - 1.0 so the p/l is the same as owning the stock, just a lower cost basis for entry.

Feels like a dump. TSLA always seems to strive for the next meme level, then falls once achieved.
Is this the world record for most Reddit awards in a single post? Well played r/wallstreetbets

GME is the exception that proves the rule though. They always stagnate/dip when WSB starts running high on it. Then when it's more trash talk and quiet time, moon time.

Elon should buy a high margin complimentary company using shares. Stock price too high imo. I would not be surprised at all if he buys another company in the next few months.
Close your eyes and cut the loss
This is the reason, why r/wallstreetbets is best of all.

Fucking love WSB for this!
Annnnnd it's gone
Cause we’re gambling addicts. I wake up no alarm 4:30am. Brutal.
Y'all have any more awards? 🥺👉🏻👈🏻

EDIT: lmao 2 awards after 5 minutes (my first awards ever), this is why I love WSB
He repeatedly stated he wont split the stock.
I seen them at open yesterday for 0.65
And if you look even closer you’ll see the PLTR double cock reaming WSB’s collective asshole
We getting layed off see u in 3 days 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
is he dead? D:
Really expected enphase to move up more🤔
What’s the weed play
Buying puts yesterday at the top was free money 😊
bong hits or shots?
TSLA might need to split again soon, too. 'Price too high imo.'
I think we need to get the awards on this post to 10,000!.. This will be a sign that GME will get to $100!.. Currently we are on 2400 awards.. So expected GME is $24.. Not good enough..


Edit: Thanks for the award!.. The best way the end the year!.
You might be retarded
AMD you mother fucker, I just need you back above $94 today
300k with half boomer half retard and half diamond 💎 ✋ stonks through March.... Could've been a lot better if I had the balls to yolo like my fellow degenerates here
Duck fondue. Classy 😏
Shit... I need an award and be part of this history making reddit post...GME 🚀🚀🚀
But if you look closely you see a double cock and balls i.e reversal
At least you guys could give the main post awards and not every comment, c'mon. You're contradicting your contradictions.

edit: you know what, I really did play myself.  🤡 I feel bad, please don't do this to me,
Wtf...this is like if someone tells me to call them they/them.
BIDU calls 0dte fuck it

This thread is super conservative about weed  , it almost feels like when I lived in Idaho and weed wasn’t legal
If Reddit was listed, that would call for buying reddit shares
They kicking the door open and push you off the chair lol
At some point Bezos will need to do a split cause Elon is coming for his head top
I was referring to the factorial lmfao
At best it’s ambiguous though...personally I’m going to stay away from anything that could remotely be considered “substantially identical” 

Risking an audit is not worth it for me
Ok I buy GME
Probably not.

In his book (Ashlee Vance) he speaks to his relationship with Larry Ellison and how the two talk at lengths about ideas and other stuff.

It’s amazing that PLTR just keeps dumping.
This stock is cheap. Buy at any price below $30. At today's closing price, Romeo has EV/2023E Revenue of 4.18. Dirt cheap in this sector for a company that already has $544 million in CONTRACTED revenue and a blue chip customer base. Not to mention Romeo actually has a commercialised, revenue generating product unlike most others in this sector.

Most brokers won't prevent you from selling your shares, but they'll warn you about your option position.  If your stop loss triggers, you're in a good position (down) to buy-back the options contract.  Close it out and don't hold it naked.
Come on Nokia, I no youve got a few cents in you today

Then tesla ran to $900+, I held. Then the february crash happened, and I sold tesla around 725$. My plan was to buy back in when it went lower. I was right, this was a great move.

Then I started trying options, and lost some money but also made some, maybe lost 2k total of 35k

Then tesla bottomed around 250$, I did not buy back yet. Then tesla ran up instantly, I was too busy playing options and missed the rocket.

If I did what I planned, I probably would have 200+ shares of tesla right now, with the average price of 50$.  I am currently down around 25k from where I started.
Theraputics
😂 I’ll keep you in mind.
Those capital gains are gonna hurt like a motherfucker
dont think a hippie wouls call him/herself democrat or republican. But then I am not a hippie like you

Nice...well maybe there’s more maneuverability than I realized. That is a pretty significant strike difference tho. I wonder if the same could be said for say swapping a $30c 3/22/21 for a $29c 3/22/21
My friend told me she bought Fubo two weeks ago because men and sports can’t go tits up. Gotta be the top now
> Ever notice that people ~~who short/bet against companies~~ are just miserable all the time? 

Yes.
I'm surprised selling naked calls isn't more popular here since it has infinite loss potential.
Maybe I should fomo buy a couple of shares.
Past performance doesn’t indicate future results.
Yes how much Thiel believes in it and every big company he’s been involved with has boomed
Holy fuck

Shhh
+33% on EBON premarket let’s fucking go. Stock twits you done good baby girl , respect is earned
Shit now I need to buy the dip today also so I can swing awards around left and right.
Or shower that post from earlier telling everyone not to buy awards and buy GME. Fuck that guy telling me what to do
Or bankrupt
Oh?
When buying calls AFTER a 170% increase in share price goes wrong
Give me a 1-7 this time
What the fuck is going on!? I’m so balls deep in GME and NVAX put your money there instead.
Last day of trading. No idea about company. I’m in.
That’s prolly it
Why is BABA toying with my feelings?
Oxymoron?
To the lasts guys point of "It makes sense at 7 or 10 not at 20" , how so? The company is either failing in 5 years like movie theaters or adapting to the times and growing. How does $10 a share make ANY sense?
Jesus christ those awards
Phew
Right there with you, literally same thing. Take the w

My broker won’t let me see the shares I have that I sell a call against and the ones I sell calls against I plan on keeping. I sell otm..
Lol definitely
How can you "barely know"?
Best day trade or 0DTE FD play for today? I’m already holding 12/31 680c TSLA
NET is killer! Been buying NET leaps like crazy during this last dip. Prob worth a gamble on shorter dated end of Jan options too if you're into that 😉
Maybe he is holding plantronics or the like
Way to be a debbiedowner, this guy is a fucking xmen
Ya prolly that and investing
I think i’m just going to buy 2 TSLA shares / month for aslong as it’s under $1000 this year. So i’ll probably make it to March.

You can place a stop loss order for your shares and call with TDA (just select both and sell). Not sure about others
Bruh, I am sorry to hear this! A lot of relationships fell apart during COVID. If you want advice, look into zen practices. It’s all about seeing your emotions as temporary and separate from the underlying reality. 

I’m not sure if it is too late, but you can apologize to your boo and let her know that you really messed up and will try again if she wants. If not you understand and wish her the best. This isn’t about her, it’s about getting closure for yourself.

> PRICED IN

Pricing in the next target? Perhaps the sentiment is that they've proven they can meet expectations and people want in before 1M deliveries. Also, P/E goes out the window on a company like TSLA because people just want to own it. Not that you mentioned that part, but it's echoed so much how overvalued it is.
🧻 ✋’d some NIO 50C FDs when it jumped 300%. That shits going to print today...
Why you gotta attack me like that 😭😭😭
I have it all, regular, Roth and rollover - should probably do the roth conversion.  Maybe should talk to a tax guy on that - something for 2021.

It was announced in Oct and will rollout in stores Jan 2021. They also will get a new CEO,  Satish Malhotra, who was formerly Sephora's  Chief Retail and Operating Officer for Sephora. Maybe Cathie thinks both are positive catalysts?
I am, I got a 182.5C, hoped it would go up to like 190 by EOW but doesnt look like that's gonna happen today
Whoa! We’re similar. I grew up democrat bc (Democrats are for poor) 

Before I rant: SPY dropping in January I bet, and when it does, it’ll be a 7bag rebound 8 weeks out.

Ok 

I was a homeless student who tried to get EBT one time. I was denied while the other drunks got approved. I became an independent after that.

Graduating this year. I’m a Democratic-Republican because I feel, that Economy is a derivatively our society, and our society is ideally caters to what the people see best. So governance is best with people at it ls heart. 

Then I found Options. Realized that anyone can go from a few paychecks to millions in one year. I now know what American Privilege feels like and those CEOs deserve every tendie for managing our tendie making opportunities. 

Pro Gun( I think we can handle automatics), Pro Choice (If Roe vs Wade falls, We gotta defend our abortion clinics with our rifles) 

...I can’t caucus with either Dems or Repubs because of those two viewpoints. And I automatically disagree with the only Independent, Da Burn!, because of my view of CEOs.
It always open with a pump and the slowly dump the rest of the fucking day lol
Well in that case, I'll take one a platinum from any stranger wanting to donate to a poor autist
what if reddit itself is pouring the awards for free to troll?

Man i love this community
The puts only worked for like 5 minutes before market close . It’s already up to 702 premarket.
Thats not gambling
By all means play it then. It’s literally traded sideways for weeks prior to the 3% bump the other day. That’s a lot of theta burn for something most people are playing OTM weeklies on.
Happy New Year!
I'm with you and feeling fucked.  What strikes you got?

Futures and premarket looking weak as hell.

We're they 0DTE?
Is it a Roth or regular ira. If it’s a Roth I think it doesn’t matter.
Dude I am a huge stoner , but I’m conservative , but I grew up democrat and I’m not a fan of trump or Reagan or  bush but I’m not a dem and I think dems are pussies . Are there people like me somewhere ? I feel like they don’t exist ... like I’m a hippy but I’m clean and professional and I don’t like hippies lol and I like capitalism
You're just flexing your big dick after you get all those GME gains here pretty soon.
Interesting TD said this...my understanding is simply shifting strikes falls under the “substantially identical” clause
Elon going to see Ellison for advice sounds super sus in a good way. got some big news comin man, i feel it in deez nuts
What are we thinking 
I'm going all in
This post and comment section is a fucking joke
1/2023 20C.  Guaranteed to print.
Don't even need the 2k bill. Just need the UI numbers today to be less than last week and we go stonking into the new year!
you don't HAVE to, but if you get assigned you're going to need to have 100 \* strike price ready to go or you're fucked big time. that said, it's not a **COVERED CALL** unless you have something to **COVER** it, and selling calls without is an incredibly stupid way of doing things.
r/wallstreetbets plays gme and Tesla
Update: fuck.

Who'd have thought it'd take a pandemic to create the infinite capital to allow one of the most speculative markets in history

Option wash sale rules are really complicated and designed to not allow you to do that but those complicated rules ensure it's a grey area and you can do what u/BadassMcGass is suggesting without washing your sales

Premarket sadly disagrees
If you sell covered calls you have to keep the shares for the duration of the contract? No stop loss orders?
This is so fucking retarded.
I checked with TDA yesterday. They specifically said they classify it as a different product and would not be a wash to sell one strike and pick up a new strike with same expiration. 

May that change in an audit? Huge maybe. So check with your broker I guess. The code leaves it up for interpretation and would be a waste of a read

Tesla is actually a legit company. GME is not. There is a massive difference between them

They’re behind ishares my dude. IVV.
I have traded it outside my IRA a lot and held long term in IRA - they say never trade same equity in IRA and trading account to avoid wash sales, but when it has huge swings and only goes back up, I throw that rule out the window.

Actually yes. It’ll only be about $40 though, which is exactly the amount your mom charges for a quickie
The big moves in Tesla in the past is because of short squeeze, imagine that happening to gme soon
We Americans don’t recognize that.
Happy new year!
Happy new year ya cunt
Yeah I sold Monday and made a nice profit off of it.
mango is the biggest shitposter while taking a dump
Biggest right now is GME and PLTR. Both bleeding currently and STIC bag holders abound with CRSR hoping to break even. So I would say our performance sucks over the last month. 

Personally down $1400 over the last week but up $2000 in December. 

$GME 450 shares
$RIOT 250 shares

If you call idiots spreading rumors on Twitter "DD", sure. But to believe them you have to ignore both of the parties involved in the actual deal, since both Ackman and the Stripe CEO have ruled it out using the exact same reasoning. 

Ackman did it months ago at the very start of the spac, after discussions with Stripe where they clearly told him they weren't ready, and the Stripe CEO had to reiterated it a month ago because these Twitter "DD" idiots kept harassing him.

I think there's a 50/50 chance on up and down - a lot of spacs go up after the announcement but usually they aren't nearly as over-hyped as PSTH - that huge premium on the escrow value is a recipe for ***"sell the news"***. Of course there's a pumper clique around here that gets mad and downvotes when you say that because they bought in way late and vastly overpaid.
Some of you all make fun of value stocks but look at what happened to LOGI.
3 ternion all powerful awards. Good lord. Do they stack?
Art Cashin is the most Chad name ever
Nope. IRS doesnt want us to have fun. Option wash sale rules are really complicated and designed to not allow you to do that. I would recommend you check out the code to make sure you don’t accidentally fuck yourself
Lots and lots of GME awards...what about the dual GME and PLTR crew? 🚀🚀🚀

What people don't get is that you need big amount of money to star a meaningful snowball. 

Like I can yolo pltr shares now with all my money and I guarantee will make next year more money than this guy in 10. If i would have at least 500k I would start thinking about dividends. Until then, there is no point investing for dividends on 50k for 3k/ year when I can swing palantir or some other big company and make much more that year

Is just lost of potential lost to play dividends on small amounts. I can easily put 400k out of 500k in dividends and 100k in safe plays and I am pretty sure most of you here will make more with that 100k SAFELY (NOT yolo calls) than dividends on 400k

I think a lot of people are off of work today so sleeping in
I sell when I’m content with my returns. If you get in the SPAC early enough which isn’t hard, ~100% shouldnt be very hard. If it’s a deal with a good company. I don’t buy SPACs above $14 and I don’t buy SPACs that haven’t announced a deal. You won’t make 100% on every SPAC trade but I haven’t made less than 50% on my trades with them this year. It’s the home run deals where you 3x+ on a trade that will make you most of your money.

I have coronavirus right now. I’d be dead if I was older or had underlying conditions, this is so fucking bad
Are my 12/31 $50 Nio calls finna print 🥱
Always a good sign before 8AM
PFE in whichever direction you think it’ll run.  The options a quarter away in strike price are less than a nickel.  Even a tiny move has the potential to be a 10 bagger.

Any chance of this Iran news smoking my tendies in any way?? I mean if we bomb the shit out of them, that's bullish, right??

My  fiancée is now into options. We have enacted a great wall of china so that we don't influence each others decisions and get pissed off.
but a post by a “professional investor” (u/vegaseller) told me PLTR would be 100-1000x... 🥺
he had visions into the future of Bigly Tech
Out of day trades on RH. God Ameritrade is awful. It's so hard to find any fucking information. How many day trades have I made? IDK can't fucking find it. Instant deposits? Nope. ghey.
People who make money off drama like TMZ and those drama youtubers are scum of the earth and should be treated like other ruiners of society like pedophiles.

It warps society into a nitpicking circle jerk where every little thing is grounds to hate others and stifles cultural innovation with cancel culture.

prove me wrong.
Can you even name their most popular ETF? I can't

Alright. I regret selling my TSLA shares. Time to just start putting cash into Tesla each month

Why doesn't Elon just price SpaceX at $1 trillion/share? Some of you all would buy it
Haha, a wild Ohio State fan appears

It was great for a few days. Then I kept buying puts and got fucked hard.

More importantly, how did his cock turn out?
This has become a vicious race. All promises I made to myself in the beginning are off. It is now a game of YOLOing and avoiding getting my girlfriend pregnant. And I guess hoping none of her boyfriends get her pregnant too.

Keep doing what you're doing? 🤷‍♂️
Trading on a smart phone. Wife beater and basketball shorts.  Lying on the couch at home.  And watching reruns of The Office or Naruto.  This is the new Wall Street.
I'm just commenting to see if I receive an award
How did you keep off it while you’re drinking tho? I feel like that’s the hardest part
Let’s go!!
So many awards to even count. What’s the Reddit record?!
This guy dont know what DD is, ban for being functionally illiterate.
Is TSLA 800c 0dte too greedy? Nope.
They’re gonna smash earnings just fyi
Ackman said Stripe wasn't ready, then Stripe began a huge hiring spree for positions relating to going public. Plenty of DD has already been done about it.

Yeah, it's not a sure thing, but I'll take those odds over meme stocks any day of the week. Even if it isn't Stripe, it will likely go up after the announcement imo.

MRNA was a real turd - I almost bought in, but actually looked at fundamentals and it saved my ass.  Day traded it a bit, but if I went long I would have wiped out at least half my gains or about 100k given the position I was thinking about.  Thank god I actually didn’t follow the herd there.

That’s the pattern
It honestly does get better the longer you go. But with most addictions I will look at the cans in a store and my mind starts telling me to just buy a can. You just gotta kind of ignore it.
Because some people got in for $20.xx, instead of $60+.

ABNB was supposed to be $65, but opened at $140+ for retail. Do you not see the difference?
Because of ARK
My god, you really are a bunch of retards aren't you?
Shit, just woke up to this retarted post with most awards probably on Reddit, well done you rich retards!
anyone got a 0DTE YOLO?
Probably androids... Or aliens. Actually, definitely aliens. Yeah.

Yeah, but it's not the same. ETF can sell a stonk at any time and go into something else. Although, you're still going to have sector risk if it's not diversified.

Lost -$20K in options; made all my money back and then some from the sector rotation into value, as well as some SPACs from September on.  

Biggest regrets: caught with Spy puts when the market reversed in March at the bottom.  Selling my $5 PLUG leaps.  NIO $7ps instead of Cs.

stop trying to pump algos
I was debating of taking some sort of gain on my AAPL long to take care of some of the tax liability in 2020, but very green this year so might just wait until I fuck up next with a stupid move from WSB and have some sort of loss.  Let’s hope Congress doesn’t f up capital gains, or add stupid transaction taxes to every trade to pay for all this bullshit stimulus that won’t make a dent in the world of fuck some people are in right now.
A lot riding on the Jan. 5th Senate runoff. If the two Dem candidates win, weed stocks will probably double by inauguration day, but I'd say the Republican candidates are slightly favored.
Gotta relax somehow.
Diamond hand tsla for real this time, and not sell at a loss.
That’s the joke
Holy shit! This is insane!

Guh
No selling. Only buy something I’m willing to hold long term.
pltr slowly going to grind to 20 cents a share at this rate
They can't sell their shares until the earnings up to dec 31st are reported.
Realistically, February.
We gotta few good weeks of being jerked off with +3% days followed by -4.6% days before that dip.
I know it'll moon eventually, realistically late 2021-2022, but I'm impatient and trade like an idiot and want those big gains fucking NOW.

I quit dipping a few years ago, unfortunately I replaced it with an addiciton to energy drinks... Its tough man
I want to be in the locked thread for the books.

Price floor dude...
No it’s not. Think about it: a system that can trade power cross country from surplus to deficit lessens the total battery amounts necessary, and also connects areas with distant storage. New York doesn’t need 10 days of New York sized batteries for when wind and solar go down. Storage is still needed but not gargantuan amounts
Don't tell me you bought LAZR *after* the massive run up?
Blood flat
Will this latest insane TSLA pump get it back some decent IV for me to sell puts?
I’ve been trying to track WSB general performance but nobody gives any actual info on their plays anymore, just generic bullshit with rocket symbols.

>“No such deal” doesn’t mean the deal isn’t being worked on. I have to believe the target is and has been set

The Stripe CEO ***literally*** spelled it out for you in idiot terms when he said that they had a lot of growth left to go and aren't going public for a few more years. In short they're not going to cash out early and leave a lot of chips on the table for useless investors to pick up as they grow.

>we're still quite early in Stripe’s journey. And when I say that, you might roll your eyes, given that we've been at this for 10 years. But we’re still growing at quite a fast rate and still investing very heavily in future growth...In many regards we’re still growing at startup-like rates and investing at startup-like rates... We're more in the helter skelter expansion phase and will be, I think, continuing to operate in that mode for a few years.
Ayo don't mind if I do, y'all are a bunch of retards anyway

i laughed way too hard at this
It just hasn't popped yet? These things take time?
Yeah, cos Iran are a super trust worthy bunch. 

Although in this particular case, I would say it's probably true. I firmly believe if Donny got elected for a 2nd term he was gunna rain down hell on Iran but now he can't so he might just try and provoke shit before he leaves. 

I dunno what to believe at this point.
Old white people
You can buy SPAC shares before or after the SPAC announces a deal with a company. You can benefit from price discovery. IPOs don’t let you benefit from price discovery before a deal gets done and market makers set the opening trade price based on buying demand.

It was easy to get it for $20 on opening day.  The price of SPACs don’t tend to move much above NAV until a LOI.  PSTH seems to be the exception.  In hoping they merge with a big established company like SC Johnson or Mars.  Maybe Wegmans would be good too.

I like $CNOO too, but it was something about not having “no” in the ticker. Some people seem to like $GOEV though. 🤷‍♂️
Lol SPCE is such a pump and dump shit stock. This company isn’t going to ever create anything meaningful. The mfers can’t even get their fucking engines to start. Y’all think fucking celebrities are going to trust their lives to some mickey mouse excuse of a “space” company called VIRGIN to get them out of the stratosphere and back in one fucking piece?
They have a 12 month price target for NIO at over $300. I love confirmation bias but CNN is fake news even with their business analyses.
I read theyre popular in China a couple years ago

One day I'm going to tell my kids where I was when NIO hit 100. I'm thinking we'll have this talk in 3ish weeks.
Let me get this straight. People buy SPACs like PSTH because they don't have access to IPOs. Yet, these SPACs start out as IPOs, so everyone missed out on buying PSTH for $20/share. Seems ironic
TSLA $3000 EOY 2021. 
I will cut my left nut off if it doesn't happen.
If you think there's going to be a flash crash I don't know what to tell you bro. The reason there was one in March was because of covid taking everyone by surprise. We've been living with covid for 10 months now, not much of a fucking surprise anymore.

Disables options trading but also stops RH from being able to borrow your shares for short sellers. Most other trading platforms pay you interest to borrow your shares, RH does not.
Plus its what is allowing GME short sellers to short so much

Kind of a shitpost, but I got the freetrade app and referred a couple people to get a couple shares and have £33 including the money I invested and have no idea what to put it in lmao cause it's only £33. Not to mention pretty much any stock worth less than £1 is behind a paywall you need to pay a subscription for with this app.

6 weeks ago, no one was on TSLA, which I understand it went sideways for a few months. 

Everyone was chasing other EV plays and PLTR.

Other EV plays are flat. TSLA up 70%.

Now everyone is back on TSLA. 

That leads me to believe that you guys are following the winners after they've already won, is this true? If so, am I just here to see companies that have had a recent breakout?
Guess what smart ass. 75% of my shares were bought at the virtual top of $32 something. I have been averaging down with what money I can since then. Don’t reprimand when you don’t even know the whole story

lol bot , your account was created in August 2020 fking new frog , my account was created in 2013. Just noticed you are that frog that created that post crying about helicopter emojis. Broke ass manchild with $1.4k account , you are actually retarded btw.

I have to admit I missed that 🚀 actually sold right before expecting another poor earnings and never jumped back in fearing the fundamental reality and expecting it to crash. But it keeps defying that reality. 

Happy for all those who have made butt loads of tendies. Congratulations!🎉
You should've rolled those calls a long time ago. You would've been a multimillionaire by now

GOT MY STIMMY DIRECT DEPOSIT JUST NOW..TESLA MOONING..🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻🍻
Move it all to an etf, wait a year for long term gains status, start selling off 4 % of the value at the time you “retired” (not 4% of total value end of year each year)
Why did I get only 1 TSLA 0DtE 😭

Have you worked with PLTR personally?

Thank you, come again
NFLX is gonna plummet in 2021. Get your puts while they’re cheap.
Tsla to 1000!
Come on MT go up you can do it!

Holy crap, y'all mad.
Can I be a fellow autist who puts all their money on Reddit awards?
Good morning tsla
can I get an award? I'm retarded
apple please hit 136. please. ill learn my lesson this time, just please 136 please
We the best at that
Imagine spending piles of money on a finance degree and working hard to get to a good school-internship-firm just to sit behind a desk and read MY piece of shit comment on Reddit at 7:13 in the morning. Did ya make it??
Up 86k this year, about 950%. Mostly due to nicely timed SPY Leaps in March. Didn't work anything at work but the bosses don't look over my shoulder. I have been mostly sleeping and masturbating working from home and making more money than average employee makes in 4 year. Life is unfair. I know.
Wow some post it notes gee golly that’s some cool stuff baby
[deleted]
Dude! Do you hate money?
The butterfly got me 😬
800m volume yesterday. Fkn nuts. About 36% shorts though. If short squeeze happens, this thing will blow up
Hmm, that‘s right. I thought the same about apple 10 years ago. You see, what happened. 🤷‍♂️
Sorry caint read. 🚀🌕
This post just went to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Holy TSLA PM
Tesla 750 EOY
You're gonna lose hella fuckin money today lmao. NEVER bet against Elon. How many times do we gotta teach this lesson
Coincidence ? I don't think so...

🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I’d buy that dip so hard
I agree, but I just don’t think it’s worth it until you have a bigger account. And to get a bigger account you need to invest in something other than boomer town stocks. Might as well get a damn CD yaknow
I love this community
bad
Pleas fly again.

Good job
😘❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🖤🤍🤎💞, 🐓🍭
Either go bullish or go, cash gang,
If both aapl and TSLA could pump today, that’d be swell.
Is TSLA going to do another split now that it's almost a grand again to create more value?
coinbase has shown me that if nyse was open 24 7 id have a mental breakdown
If not we BTFD.
TSLA bears don’t $ROPE just yet I‘m sure there’s many opportunities to be gay in 21
You see how cocky he is in that tweet? Dude took on Amazon and won. He knows what he’s doing and I’m taking the ride with him

Edit: I got in before all the retards made all of WSB into GME 24/7. But the more the merrier

Yes
Everything is flat....TOO FLAT
I sold BIDU at the close yesterday to go all in on Tesla calls for 1/15. How should I feel
idk if dude is trying to nuke your account, but markets won't be open tomorrow. Do not by calls expiring this week (i.e. expire today).
Bro you do know I was being sarcastic this entire time right ... Don't want you roping on the slight chance you don't get sarcasm.
Destiny is all!
Ughh elon keep going baby
Remember that one day TSLA was at $540 during premarket and then crashed to $400 on Sept 3rd? Hope this ain’t a repeat since I have calls!
Probably just going to be a pussy and buy Amazon all year.
I sold a $27 put that expires... today... market's closed tomorrow bro
 BoA has increased Nio price target to $59. 🎆✨🎇
I hope baba recovers
Feel like a fucking prospector reading these comments.

Down 40% positions: retard
Who is buying this? Wsb retards?
Why there is Slack in the picture and not Google? Are you really this retard?
You on cash or margin acc?
You trying to sell calls?
If you have a 100 shares shouldn’t be a problem. They aren’t going to let you sell naked calls unless you have 250k

THIS IS SOME CRAZY THREAD!

WHY ARE YALL SPENDING SO MUCH? BUY THE GME!
I got a rock.
Make 700 The Floor Again.
Looks like fucking you.
I've just been buying leaps cause the market hasn't been following logic.
It’ll dump at open then slowly crawl back.
You mean 710 pre open
Give me award, and I'll increase my position to $6942.0
Making a shameless post to attract awards, wow. Please feel to deposit your awards with me, I am a quintuple amputee day trader.
I’m buying long Tsla puts on open call me a madman
so Jack ma might have removed his denture but he didn't put vaseline in his throat and that apparently displeases the pooh very much
He’s on robinhood
RIP that guy who posted yesterday he's all in on puts

If you know that, everyone knows that. Priced in.

My tsla 1dte calls atm!
So..TSLA bears. How you doing?
This post is sponsored by RAID: Shadow Legends
So is [this](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/understanding-palantir-technologiess-unusual-options-150250563.html) why PLTR has been dumping? A large short placed on Tuesday?
Damn
There were some console bundles for pre-order where if you went to the store you could pre-order the consoles to be delivered in late December/early January, so it may just be some retards that don't understand that those consoles are still being produced.
Pre-market bids on TESLA are a sight to behold
fucking 700 EOY
Cant talk about small cap, and with markets consolidating it’s hard to talk about plays outside of daily plays where TIMING the market will make the biggest difference, so saying  “buy x calls” isn’t viable. Saying buy the cheapest ITM call at close with a delta above .60 and selling a half hour after open and an hour before close is a viable strategy, but it really kills if you’re wrong.
🤪🤪🤪🤪 crazy. I hope. I did sell half my position yesterday 12.31 680c. Don’t regret locking in gains.
😉
If one of my tickers pops up I immediately sell. These fuckers broke ARKG / ARKK.

Thankfully its recovering and I got some more at the dip
It’s actually kinda pathetic. I have a few friends who live with their parents at 23, that boast about receiving unemployment and not having to work. Lazy fucks
Yeah of course they do. Then we'll have to wait. Damn it, I hate waiting

TSLA is just something else
Spot was my first choice
Buy high sell low
congrats tesla call holders!! holy shit
I’m back
Happy birthday but no
Give me award
Buys reddit awards*
Imagine if we could cash out awards on our post
Let’s do this
Surely this is the most expensive thread in WSB or maybe even reddit? How much GME stock is this?
I’ll buy GME today if I get an award
Bruh. TSLA back to $1,000 after a 5-1 stock split is insane
GME gang bitch
To the moon you say?
TLDR please
Today is my birthday.

All i want is for my 373 puts to print.
Yeah. They thought oil tankers would have insane earnings because they were storing oil like crazy around the middle of quarantine. Never stopped to think that it would literally be *the best they would ever do again and that it was the top.*
TSLA 710 by open you mean
[removed]
Hold forever
Tesla is going to do the same thing SPY did to bears a week ago. Hit ATH pre market then violently come down.
No mames wuey
Started the year at 110k mostly in boomer stocks, ending the year literally all in on GME and sitting at around 135k account value.  Roth IRA on the other hand only up about 14% on a starting balance of 46k but that's almost entirely in a Vanguard index because I'm gay, I guess
The first 4 were profitable if you know how to take profits and not hold til expiration. 🤷🏽‍♂️
How in the caitlyn jenner does this sub have so much disposable income to spend on awards?
Wtf does this even mean
as an outsider... H U H?
I have been scrolling for a good ten minutes reading the comments. Not one didn’t get an award. You guys are fucking retarded
Bro I tried 4 different times putting in crazy amount of years exp etc. said fuck it and opened up E*TRADE. Also moved my Roth over since they would let me do options in it
Whose dick I need to suck to get an award?
It’s going past 715 next week 🚀🚀🚀
Hold Nio shares or sell? I feel a dip coming.
Tsla moon baby

Only took 5 months but you'll soon break even!
Because of the open board seats for that proxy vote, right? I think there were 2-3?
It will no question.. but talk about manipulation though.. institutions making litcoin their bitch
There was a tanker gang in 2020? lol cuz that went soooo well last time
No
Can't tell them what to do. They are 5 year olds
Yeah obviously 1$/ month is a beginner, obviously playing riskier can make more money. When you start playing with bigger accounts or looking towards retirement a portion in divs is an excellent strategy.
TSLA BROKE 700
TSLA!!!!! 😍😍😍😍
Yes but it’s only for some stuff and in beta. If I was a guessing man which I am, I would say we are sitting on the floor right now and it’s going to go up 10% today. But it might trade flat today and go up 10-20% on Monday. Look for the company to say something soon, they aren’t shy about saying how well they are doing, or what they’re working on

Started with 35k first week in August
.. Goal was to finish the year at 100k... On exactly my bday September 1st I was sitting at 153k after my first month of trading... Took screenshots of my account that day 🤦🏾‍♂️ , holding tsla, apple, Qualcomm, and a couple other Sept 18 contracts I was up huge on, post split ... Remember the warning signs like it was yesterday, tsla did that stock offering and tsla started to slip after being up bigly in pre market that Wednesday or Thursday ... That Friday my account dipped around 68k and I thought we'll recover after labor day! Tuesday came and all hell broke loose for September 😔... Spent the last 3 months recovering mentally.. Went as low as 2k, but have fought back to 25ish with etsy and citi and a few others ... Has been rough thinking what could have been, worst line of thinking when trade gambling.. Effected my patience, broke my rule of only doing 30 to 45 day contracts trying to get it all back at once... Pretty sure others can agree! 35k to 153k to 20ish for the year... 2021 I'll be at 250k with Pay-tience! Let's get it!
Oof I thought you were learning, did I say but options that expire next week? We aren't in /investing here.
Meh he will get some appreciation on his stocks too, at the end of the day that guy sounds pretty reasonable most people would be happy with like high single digit percentage gains, this sub has just made us degenerates wanting 1000% on every trade 

2k a year is an amount that you can actually do something with a nice holiday or something atleast unlike $1/month lmao

Highest I’ve seen is 699.4. Did it break 700 already?
I love this place
I been waiting since yesterday. No good dip yesterday, and got sad after it started mooning :(
It's a print later on buddy. Dark pool are traded during the day and then registered after hours. And also you ever seen level 2? There is no way in a hell am order size that big can fill after hours without a massive shift in price.
HHAHAHAHAHA the amount of money spent on awards in this single thread is probably enough to feed twenty small villages. Sorry, small villages!!!
TSLA LET'S GOOOO 🚀🚀🚀
The pharmacist would be an apothecary back in those days but good job. Cheerio!

Probably gonna sell some of my GME position and hop into some B N G O shares

Fubo offers some events in 4k streaming. First of its kind to do it! Yep I have it and it works great. One thing I cannot come to grips with in regards to betting/fantasy, is the slight 1 minute delay that all streaming services have. That’s one reason I think fubo won’t be so much focused on “sports betting”, but they will focus more on contests (acquisition of balto sports) which would be more along the lines of fantasy (which is growing massively). How can you make bets during the game or decisions on bets, when you’re 1 minute behind? What if the other team fumbled and you didn’t see it? Seems odd to me. But whatever. When I first owned a roku device it sucked so bad, I got rid of it and got a fire stick for that tv and never looked back. look at roku now ... anyways I think fubo can get acquired by google or roku or amazon. Or they can start making their own device. Regardless. The CEO bought 200,000 shares and hasn’t sold 1. Lockup expirations are generally the bottom. Look at dkng, pton, pins, Uber, lmnd (recent on Monday dec 28th, already back up.). All lockup expiration dates were a bottom or very close to it, especially if it dumped leading into the date.
I like how everyone is pretending TSLA had resistance at $695. It was $694.20 and we all fucking know it
Can I have an award?
I know!  "monica geller"
Yeah, all you have to do is comment
Well, wait and see.  If everything drops today...
They’re sheep. Bullish after everyone else already is and vice versa
I can't tell the autism from the dd anymore

Did you sell any. Seems once you sell some it no longer includes it in the average.

Example: buy 100 shares at $10 then 100 at $20 average is $15. But if you sold 100 shares and selling preference is 1st in 1st out the average would change to $20.
BABA
30 days of substantially similiar position my man.
GME 40c 12/31
I didn't take 10k day profits on a penny stock play BCS I was greedy. Still made 3k on that day trade 🤣
when do they report?
Buy more OTM
I got that 694.20 screenshot 😎
You gotta give ass to get ass
Drop some good safe calls bets!!

Update: Buying 3 TSLA calls for 715 strike price expiration: 1/8/21
Yeah, I think the Tesla shorts cumulatively pay his “research firm” (just him) for this shiiite.
God damnit another guy there has 3m shares and they sent him a gift box with sun lotion and post-it notes.

Where's the WSB gift box? I want my tequila and cigars

God bless
Okay than I'll take Feb 19 - 29 and 33c. Thank you :)

Remember that next time something gets shilled hard here

Fuck
Getting exercised is still a profit. Maybe you can buyback at a dip next week, who knows.
Moon
Wtf they are worse than r/Investing
BILI is nice
This is the way.
I'm in 7/16 35Cs right now. Personally I would go with calendar spreads. Maybe short February or April depending on how well you think it will do.
Dang so they upscale their sports to 4K. I’m gonna take a free trial. Will report back with my findings lmao keep an eye on this stock. You think 30s the floor now?
There’s never been a bubble CNBC hasn’t helped pump.
All you need is literally any long position to make about 30% or more this year. My point is these weirdos think it’s cool to hang on to pieces of shit that somehow didn’t recover from pandemic dip levels, but have a dividend. It’s like they get off on it. Price remains stagnant for 6 months? That’s alright, you got a sick dividend bro check out that dollar right there. Oh yeah, that’s the stuff right there
Relative to today yesterday was the dip exactly how long have you been waiting, 5 minutes?
TSLA $700!!!! Holy shit
I don't even have a RobinHood account, I just live vicariously through you retards. But the amount of stupid awards this has... I feel retarded just looking at this post.

Is this that herd immunity thing those fancy scientists are talking about. Are we all immune to not being fucking autists?

If they beat delivery two quarter in a row that would be cause enough for a $55 share prices

This dude on CNBC has Apple calls. Lol. $200 , 3 trillion market cap. 🤡🤡
I don’t see 🚀🚀🚀

Buy PUTS
Then they will take it away once it hits $55
Gordon Johnson must be in the deepest pit of denial I've seen any "analyst" be in. Either that, or he's being paid by someone to say these things. Either way, nothing he's ever said of Tesla has had any substantial value.
Tesla fair value is $10 trillion, still got 15x left upside
This is fucking hilarious 🤣
Shouldn't have posted this here you fucking gay piece of shit. these comments are coming for you
July is pretty far out for a spread. Too much extrinsic value
The amount of time it took to load all the rewards was fascinating
You don’t go up coins lol unless you buy them  which at this point I think we all are wishing we did back in March or before 2016 lmao

I don’t feel comfortable sharing my other portfolios but my ira is up 45% as well this year :)
Exercising is going to lock you to hold the stock for at least another year, to get favorable taxes. With Biden’s proposed tax plan kicking in 2022, it’s even more risk for little benefit. In my opinion, 99% of LEAPS, especially with this much gain, should be sold and the gains should be locked in. Capital gains aren’t going to get any lower, only higher from this year. Again I’m no financial advisor and I’d talk with one for your scenario.
tsla with lazr lidar sensor is the play.
Yeah I’m pretty confident it’ll go up long term. But even if it doesn’t, I plan on selling covered calls above my assignment strike for extra cash. So if it dumps slightly, stay still or pumps, I still make money. 

As long as it doesn’t dump to like 13 and stay there forever. I don’t think it will.
What's the most sure way to draw 4%?
So who got the 696.90 screenshot?
If gme closes below $23 your options will expire worthless 😢
I would have done it for cheaper if you asked
What in the actual name of Daddy musk?!?!? You guys really just had to go full retard on the last day of the year???
CNBC only bring bullish people on. 99/100 people that show up on CNBC are bullish. They aren’t gonna tell the truth about the market to the viewers lol. Mfers saying valuations don’t matter now . Ok.
29bil. P/S of 17 and growing fast. Compare that to most other growth stocks and this looks like a very good deal.
Yeah but depending on account they will only let you do bs covered calls and stuff even if approved :(
Make it relatable to us. How do the numbers work in a Reno Nevada simulation?
Guess it means he’s up 100 x 24k or whatever the current price is
55/60 debit spread only .73
2 days later is still a wash sale?
My phone crashed twice trying to load the awards in this post lmao
I saw someone who was proud to be making 2K/year in dividends and attached a photo - he had like 60K+ invested for that. Juicy annual 3% return?
I'd like 1 award please? Thank you.
TESLA 700 PRE MARKET WE DID IT REDDIT

I can not contain my excitement. Buying more shares today
What does these awards even do anyway ?
Fuck I sold Tesla 700 calls . I am fucked aren’t I ?
Don't listen to the other comments, IBKR is by far the best
If it falls below $23 I'm going all in $rope
If your friend just picked other answers he could have 0% or 94%.

Man even that tow hitch is gravity operated.  Innovative indeed!
Hahaha fucking hell I'm such a trader I never noticed that before.  Brilliant autisting, sir (or madam).
Lol same
Who gave the ternion awards?
Giving away awards like used Z1P shares.
Sir, this ISNT a casino!
Very convincing...
If it falls to 24, i would be all in.  If it hits 23, i would be all in with margins and a bunch of hedge otm puts.
Stop playing BABA!
Can I get an award too?
They exist. (See sibling reply.) I've personally coded interfaces to Instinet, LiquidNet, and (technically) Chi-X. Technically on the last one because it was more of a hidden order functionality on their main exchange.

There's a list of them here too: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark\_pool](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_pool)
Did you sell and buy back the same thing soon after?  It’s called a wash sale.
The unlikely things that just might happen in 2021. GME, BABA, LMT, GOLD, GILD

GME: GameStop signs exclusive rights to sell all playstations and Xbox’s. In return they give back 95% of profit only netting them 5% of total sales profit(the previous Xbox contract and anything similar with PlayStation would pay off). The perk of this would be monopolizing the console sales industry.          

BABA: gets the Xi pump to compete against Amazon. ANT is forced to part ways with assets, but that only boosts the price of BABA.              

LMT: signs a contract with nano to build a 3d printing hanger where they will be able to embed chips and circuitry directly into the airframe itself.           

GOLD is somehow going to drop in price as the dollar gets weaker. The Yuan becoming a haven currency will become the greatest headline of 2021.         

GILD: no takeovers by Roche but they come out with a 1 dose covid vaccine with 99% efficiency 1 day after getting poked(no RNA which excites people).        

2020 was weird, but who’s to say 2021 can’t add onto that?         

Obligatory: Amazon 🚀🚀🚀.        

Edit: this is not investment advice and should be used for entertainment purposes only.
Is there even enough platinum in reddit to keep this up ?
Worried about nio missing delivery numbers best case they beat and surprise on nio day 
Worst case i become destitute
The dip was around 620 sir
I’m scheduled for my COVID19 first dose on Wednesday. Our county health dept said they only plan to stock Moderna. MRNA 🚀
I’ve noticed this as well, shockingly the sub is maturing.
It could have been worse tbh
Always a bull market somewhere lol

Why does TD show my position average at way higher than I actually bought? Doesn’t make sense. Puts on TD’s shitty math

Just cuz you lost 95% on puts doesn’t make a classic investment strategy bad

BTW, hello from 2021!
Fuck EOY trading, tax loss selling and sell off on absolutely no volume today
More $MSTR
NIO to the moon!
How so
I’ve never been more excited to buy a dip in my life. Praying and watching for that TSLA dip like a hawk. Who else?!
So you want to take the night shift from the hospital then? That'll go over well

Where are all these extra nurses coming from? You do know there is a national shortage....

Today will most likely be a low volume boring day. Trade accordingly.
4k goes brrrrrrrrrrr
Screw this my dudes, going all in today
cool answer 😅 touché
There’s better ways to rob the rich. Or we can build a bank and rob the poor.
Not really, depends on your country and broker. In my country (Asia), the CFD broker does not give more leverage (not to mention the various downsides). In Europe maybe.
Literally can't go tits up
Up 100 coins? What does that even mean then lol
People need to stop buying reddit awards for people. It's just gonna make the Chinese government even stronger and will make my BABA stock go even further down somehow

At least it's not options. Just be patient. It'll go up.

You paid too much.
So can I buy a 700 strike price for next week even if it’s already 698 or is that dumb
Pltr lock up peroid expires today 🤣🤣 good luck there buddy, if u wanna save face sell now realize ur losses and buy the huge dip thats comming
I've coded interfaces to several dark pool exchanges. They're fragmented / off-market, i.e. totally separate from the main exchanges, so they're not part of any "official" data. They work like a normal exchange but no public order book, only revealing the last trade price and maybe volume. So you post your limit and market orders blind. I also remember something to do with a timer but I can't honestly say I remember what for. Maybe only executing crossed limit orders every X seconds. The purpose was probably to prevent participants from being able to infer the order book by snooping with low volume limits orders. Don't take this as truth, I truly don't remember. There was also a "half-dark" exchange. This one simply pooled all the volume at each price level together, i.e. the public order book looked as if there were only 1 participant per price level.

ARKG to the moon friends!
Volume gonna be shit today? Or sneak attack man the torpedos..
Fubo has abc and cbs, sling does not have either of those. YouTube tv is the only competitor and they are missing a lot of Spanish speaking and international goodies. Why would you choose att over Verizon? iPhone over Samsung galaxy? People make choices.
Well,  unlike the advice you will get here,  I will take some profits and roll over the rest.   Probably 40/60 or 30/70.   You never want to have all of your eggs in one basket.  If I rolled it all over, that would start to become a bigger part of my portfolio than I would like.
🚁GANG
Just dropped 4K on GME
Let's focus on what's important. How many puts does that equal
Why isn't GME bankrupt yet? Just the price differential between the disc vs digital PS5 proves they will be.
Rip the bong, shower, and rip it twice more. I'll pack an extra big bowl in the Mighty for you. If this poop doesn't come out in the next 30 mins, I'll even add some crumble to get things movin'
Good call man. Shit is beat down.
Wrong sub. This is wsb.
GameStop gave me .50¢ trade in value for the first assassins creed game two years after it released. 

I just bought enough GME calls to secure me about 3 copies of that exact same game. Fuck you, GameStop. Who’s the winner now.
You see you're learning! You can buy 10x as many today & that means 10x the gains.
I would go with this set up: Buy ICLN 07/16 29c - sell 07/34c. Sounds reasonable to me. What would you say?

Can I buy weeklies today ?
How retarded do you have to be to buy a Reddit award for 100$?
This is the way
So buy in 10 days... got it.
If it falls to 23, I get assigned 700 shares. 

😐

A gram is usually around 60-80$. Oh wait shares?? What?
that was me paying her, not the stimulus
Oh so I’d use fubo instead of YouTube tv or Xfinity or sling etc? Why did I think they were sports only. What’s their advantage right now?

No I literally just got mine. Why would I lie about it?
The bid/ask spread on ICLN and the ARKs can be a little wide. Make sure to choose appropriate strikes and expirations.
TSLA 700 inbound.
It just does BTFD
Buy otm weeklies on Wednesday or better yet Thursday when they're at their cheapest, go all in every week. 

Thank me later.
Wanna rob a bank with me
Okay buying options for next week that cost 4K got it
Don't bank on it. These announcements are becoming your daily dose of cocaine. It gets you high as shit when you started but the effect diminishes over time. The earning will be the next big dose. Until then, I don't see any big moves.
Dear lord, are we going to suffer these posts for every insignificant contract that's renewed? Can you imagine doing this for all stocks lol.
Well if anything today is definitely the last day
Ah. Thought you were literally 100% in
Anyone all in on MSTR?
This is the way!
Sounds good! I had heard about it when it came out but sat on my hands lol dang it already hit 60?? Wow

Where do I even find this channel. I have google tv.  But I don’t have google the internet lol seriously is it on Comcast or whatever how can they be so big

For the record haven’t done any DD on those shares. Been watching ARKG a little, just saying I like doing spreads in general

You identified the problem, now deal with it.

Started the year with 88k. Currently sitting at 732k. Basically went all in on TSLA stonks last year. Never sold. 

Also grew my Roth IRA from approx. 5k to 40k. Bought and sold tesla stocks. Did some theta gang trades for a bit. Bought tesla LEAPS. Thinking of cashing out and going all in on GME gang.

Edit: I was talking about cashing out the 20k in LEAPS I have in my Roth. NOT the 700k worth of shares in my regular account.
Thank you
You want to get rich to quicly, what's wrong with making only 2-300% per year ?!

Stonks are hot atm, why would you want to risk all your capital on calls ?
Thank you, I'll do it right at open :)

I started actively trading at the end of July. Was up 300% at one point, but now after pulling out fun money, I'm down -30% for the year. It really is easier to make money with more money.
So is tax taking done? Are we back on the train to tendie town?
Exactly what I would expect to happen lmao
WTF this is absolutely retarded!

# Buy shares!
Teach me master 🚀🚀🚀
Stop commenting- the ratio has become imbalanced
What’s a platinum award?
Nothing is 100%. So yes there’s a minuscule chance it does once actions are taken.
Well, I didn’t make any withdrawals.  

So...  Pretty sure I’m at break even
I feel like as a Jew it’s impossible for me to not succeed at investing.
That's one approach to investment.

You bought short dated GME calls?
I have been buying options all year. Trying to go to the other side

So pump and dumps, got it.

If it was based on any sort of technicals the stock should stick to an upper area.
Here, you dropped this 👑
What do you have planned?
Even their larger stores are too small for an esports event. Their best bet is to try to monopolize the sales of gaming consoles. Microsoft and Sony would agree to it if they gained a substantial share in sales profit percentages. No other company would be able to do anything about it because all of their competitors are monopolies in their own way.
[deleted]
I’d be upset
It needs more! Weekly free awards assemble.
I decided to buy 2 calls without knowing what company  the GME ticker was for. I belong here.
Lol rip
You've got quite a bit more on the line, so I'm rooting for you probably even more than me.
Why would unfilled sell orders bring the price up?
So guys if PLTR falls below $23 will it be bought back up? Or roll down the hill?

Edit: no positions I’m just afraid for some of you guys
The only thing stopping me from buying 1 million shares of GME is somewhere in the ballpark of $20 million
Fuck yea
Seriously I watched that show where he talks about spending an exact amount of money on a mcdonald's breakfast every morning and I'm like fuck this douche. Fucking boomer propaganda
Is it okay to just buy debit spreads on ICLN and ARKG cuz I'm fucking poor? I'm bullish on them but don't want to spend too much on them
Wsb is slowly moving away from options 

And I don't like it. If you aren't spending your entire account on weeklies then what's the point.
-7% today
Joke is on you my paycheck for this week is only $200
If Tesla doesn't crack 700 premarket, AND IF it craters at open. Buy the dip, there's going to be an ungodly amount of unfilled sell orders at 699 to bring that price back up

You know it
I said to buy at 12-14 when no one had heard of it on my old account. Got downvoted and ignored. The stocktwits board had NO activity back then. Now the stock is on TV and the board js as active as aapl or dkng. The stock just got diluted heavily because the lockup expired yesterday but I expect that yesterday was the bottom. Huge volume, huge price decline but not too huge. No notable news other than big shorty bashing. Good news to come in the future in the form of fantasy sports integration announcement (I know this because of their latest acquisition of Balto) 
Look at lmnd, lockup expired dec 28 Monday. 
Fubo is the real deal and their users are growing extremely fast especially internationally. Good luck!

This was already announced. They literally had a schedule come out that said this. Guess what, they plan on cutting it by 30% in 2022. It incentiveses people to buy now.
60k gain this year, started with 30k for a 200 percent increase to 90k. I learned to never try to time the market again. I wasted two years sitting my money on the sidelines. I could have over 150k if I played my cards right.

TSLA 700. Surely puts are the answer...???? MM Fergots gonna make sure it stays below right? I have no idea what I'm doing.
It was recent success in stem cell therapies (sickle cell), and AlphaFold, that had me thinking about this field more. Both were known in March (even last year), but details only finalized later in the year. Returns from vaccine treatments are something I'm less interested in, which is probably where a good deal of this years returns have come from.
I called Amyris when it was at 5, juuuuust sayin
touching myself rn
My Christian education was a looong time ago, but God hated the temple merchant and money changers. I wonder what is opinion would be about PLTR, I bet he is more of a TSLA guy.
This. This is why Pltr will stagnate or fall more.
Starts to draw the correlation between unexpected things that you don’t care about, 

For instance: 

The amount of chicken tenders sold at various locations in relation to VIX.
LMFAO

Just sold all my NIO shares yesterday 😮
[Another top post bragging about his 2k made this year - in the comments he discusses how his investments are now worth 9k less](https://www.reddit.com/r/dividends/comments/knawt1/just_hit_2000_for_2020/ghjjk6o/). The man made an entire post bragging about losing 7k and he's being hailed a hero.
Why wouldn't he? I know a few people that got theirs already

Have you looked at their PnL? They're not very profitable. Also the larger their market share gets, the bigger of a target they'll become. They stand no chance against a nation state ever.

Was up 65% until Canoo brought my smooth brain back down to 48% for the year.
I see your professional tectonic analysis and raise you gin with tonic analysis.

PFE has exhibited 8% growth YOY on share price. They've also spun off companies share holders received stock in so strictly looking at PFE growth is skewed. All things considered they are slightly undervalued for their sector. A price target of $40-45 in 2021 is not unreasonable. They took a huge gamble investing into the development of the COVID vaccine and are thus far successful. It wont be a home run money printer like Viagra or whatever, but it will cash flow and provide some profit. A logical market would be buying, but the market is now controlled by retards playing volatility. The specific companies (Roche, Novartis) are more expensive with less or the same YoY growth and a lower dividend yield. 

PFE is a great boomer play right now. Load up in your Roth and let the tendies get as golden as the years you are finally allowed to access them.
Gme wont move in premarket it’s ridiculous
That would be me contributing to that strategy with calls at 9:30 and sell calls before close.

Are we still getting free awards?
Got some Apple calls in Germany, our market is closed today. Dont you fuck me and dump, your wifes boyfriend and i visit the same golf club on weekends.
Why is this thread so dead wtf? No ones talking about GME enough either, wtf is going-on?? GME TO MARS 🚀
This
Because you get to file the loss for 2020, meaning you get a tax-reduction for 2020. Cutoff date was 28-30 December (can't remember the date)
Number of awards sure, but value of awards this post is on another level. Especially combined with all the awards in the comments. Almost all the ones in the post you linked are free or very cheap.
Not “his” money.
This worthless cuck got family money and investor money to blow. Never earned a dime in his life.

He couldn’t tell you the price of milk. Without googling it.

This is true WSB type stuff here. I bought at several different intervals, but my main position is up 732% and it still has an incredible amount of way to run. Truly a unicorn tech stock, I have never seen anything like it in 20 years of trading.

Who is “They”?
Man, I called these awards fucking useless when Reddit launched them but looks like I’m the one made to like a retard by people fucking buying these shit coins and awards.

But regardless, I love you retards.
But what happens to a synthetic long once margin shares convert to cash shares? Suddenly instead of having A (original owner) lending to B (short seller) that sells to C (synthetic long), you have A that recalls their shares and B has to buy the shares in the open market to deliver to A leaving C intact? Can a synthetic long re-lend their shares?

-78k loss (-98.9%) this year. 

Never get into options. If I held all my tech shares I would’ve been at 150k or higher. 

Had shares in all the FAGMAN stocks beginning of year, NVDA, SHOP at 300, NET at 20, PTON at 27, FSLY at 20. Had everything and sold in fucking March at the bottom. Then I’ve been trying to short the market last few months.

This must 100% be a troll.

According to a research i just pulled out of Google and my ass, the cheapest country to live in is Pakistan, which is supposedly 3.70 times cheaper than the country i live in right now. In my country you can live with 1200€ per month by yourself (with some VERY good money management). this mean that in Pakistan, cheapest country in the world according to the cost of living index, that sum would be 325€ or 400$, 4800$ a year.

This dude gains are pauper level even for the cheapest country in the world, with a 1% of monthly cost of living covered, and his next goal for 50$ per year would raise that to a whopping 4%. Where the fuck does he live?! Also those dividends come from money spent on shares that might go down, losing him YEARS worth of dividends!

tl;dr: 100% a troll
Not everyone has to deal with shitty US tax code bruh, flat 19% baby

They are assets being used as collateral for margin.
You’re supposed to buy TSLA calls...retard
Isn't it off today?
I may be a paste-eating brainlet, but mark my words - unemployed Melvin analysts will be delivering us our PS5's via Doordash by Q2
Man there is absolutely no volume today. Even AAPL shares are barely trading.

What does no volume usually mean for the market? Flat day? Or just wild volatility swings?
One award pleaze
His plan is to buy exclusive sales rights for 95% of sales profit on a recurring contract. The 95% of profit he doesn’t keep goes to Sony and Microsoft as they will be able to double down on profit and GameStop will have monopolized the console sales industry ahead of their $400 releases in 2021. Either that or GameStops are going to turn into the old porn video stores that have a glory hole round the back.
so if we just comment on this post we get free awards?
So it’s a hyper growth stock that loses money on a GAAP basis due to some accounting rules. They are generating cash from operations and they indicated earlier this year that 2021 would be a year of 12-15% ebitda.

Just keep your eye on them.

40% dividend payout ratio should be sustainable. Not sure they have any real advantage or moat. More of a growth opportunity, hopefully they can transition legacy customers over to their new services.

Just bought a bunch of shares today
If you're buying something on etsy make sure to google and if they have a website. Happened to me last week. I bought a gift and it was significantly cheaper to buy directly from the store online than on etsy.
I finally built my consulting business up to making \~400k a year and doing business for three companies to working 2 weeks on/one week off for 28 bucks an hour...Oil and Gas so you expect busts like this, but man life comes at you fast.
Yeah, saw it.

I bought 2 copies of 13 sentinels to give to friends, the new kingdom hearts game and pre ordered the new persona 5 yesterday. For a grand total of 200 dollars at GameStop. Just doing my part.
LOL.  Nope.
I wonder if Jim Cramer understands the value of the awards given in this post? Someone needs to add up the value and tweet him. I think it might literally make his head explode. He will then realize just how accurate his statements about WSB being a powerhouse is.
I hope RC keeps this up, he's taking a page right out of Elon's trolling playbook.  Smart move on his part.  As they say, no publicity is bad publicity.  I've got a lot of money on the line that says 2021 turns RC into the next meme machine fuck boy.

The market knows
I am a digital advertiser too working for big tech. I agree that the impact for the industry with the iOS14 changes is huge both for targeting and measurement purposes, however I would be very careful to short FB just for this reason. 

You may get lucky because all nasdaq is pretty high right now, so at some point it will pull back, but a few things to consider for order of importance:

- While Covid is around results for big tech ad companies are going to be phenomenal. More and more advertisers are swifting their budgets from off to online and almost every small/medium business in the planet is investing on digital ads to survive.  Covid wasn't around in Jan/Feb 2020 and March was the shock month that every business stopped investing, so Q1 last year was weak, I expect outstanding 4Q20 and 1Q21 growth.

- Android has around 75% of the global mobile market penetration.

- There are a lot of targeting formats that can be used without tracking apps and collecting user info.

- As someone mentioned before, I am sure there is an army of engineers building work-arounds as we speak.

Just my two cents...
AMC are so cash strapped. I would be surprised if they survive another 5 years. They are going the way of Sears and JCPenney.
I’m just here to gather any leftover awards.
I can see all awards that can be given on reddit at one place
Regift it to me. Sounds like you don’t really want it anyways 😉
WHAT. DID. I. SAY. GREEN. BY. OPEN.
Frodo es un guey.
Valid point
Sell, it's a meme stock
Europoor here, I only make about 10k a year, for me losing 20k would be completly devastating.
Just don't average down on a non trend.
Is it just me or futures being slightly green is an indicator of flat or down day...
I bought some shares of this today
I love the pure degeneracy of this sub. Just a bunch of fucking idiots and I love it.
Dude is gonna be at the Wendy's counter trying to swap awards for chicken dinners.

Set for life from Reddit awards. Good way to end 2020.
I still don’t see a catalyst for this rising until we see Q1 numbers or get a dividend guidance. Most investors here are still boomers
Depends if you need cash on hand rn
Haha look at all the retards posting comments trying to get awards after the rally. Buy high sell low in true autistic fashion

First day of the new tax season. He's saying if they sell a huge gainer today they pay taxes in April - if they wait 1 more day to sell they have a whole additional year.
Why do you think PRPL is going up right now? I'm checking out their balance sheet and it looks like income is down this year over last year. Their EPS is zero and I can't see any news that would really explain this. I'm not shitting on the stock, just asking.
The people here are handing out awards like hamburgers at Wendy‘s.
Got gifted Tesla stock. Hold or sell?
IDK about you bro but it seems like people on this subreddit just robed a damn bank
[removed]
if anyone could predict a price, they wouldn't tell you about it.
nice solid kind of conservative strategy. I do something similar but with selling puts. In your case, you are selling weekly covered calls OTM and then either taking the premium or getting assigned and then selling the 100 shares? Have you tried to sell the weekly covered calls and then buy them back once there is a gain to minimize chances of being assigned? I'm thinking of trying that strategy in 2021. The main reason I don't sell covered calls is I don't want to get assigned and have to sell the shares when I think the stock has the chance to go up a lot more. My broker Vanguard doesn't allow me to roll. I'm assuming you might be using something like Robinhood.
That actually would help push some of the kids who are already scared of buying 2 shares of gme to r/investing where they belong.
Yeah, using literal Benjamins for TP lol
Think tesla went to the moon? X Company will go to fucking Mars baby.
There’s no fucking way there are almost 2k awards on this post.
Who ses im Gay?

What kind of a retard actually pays for awards?

This is possibly the most autistic thread I’ve seen on Reddit.
Give me award
If BIDU and SQ both close today at their current bid price in the premarket then my other 19 zero DTE positions can expire worthless and I'll be around breakeven on all the FDs I just bought. I'll close those long before then though.

I have a good feeling about my BABA put too and this MA $350p was cheap but my oil calls are about to vaporize. 

I fully expect BIDU to shit the bed right before open
Great job Chief

Do you basically just ask for awards and they come?
AAPL down, futures flat. Looks like max pain for my portfolio today fuck.

Stripe CEO said there is “no such deal”. What a cock tease. I believe he is still in the Fintech sector but I don’t know of any legitimate targets. Dumb bears think its subway or chick fil a. I would be incredibly disappointed even if it popped 20%
Does this mean you are coming back to GME gang?
I totally agree but currently I only hold 200 shares. Let’s see what Q1 brings

Hey was trying to start tock market trading. What is GME? Is it gamestop corp?
It's known to pop before/ after earnings
I hoarded three 3080s at launch and sold them for like 80% profits after a few days
Someone needs to do the math on this one
Hell yeah bruv, I'm holding my 400 shares until 150 or 0. Ima small fry but I'm in the fight 💎 ✋

Everything needs context. In the all-time hottest bull market with IV at near frenzied levels like we are in right now? Anyone getting 1% returns per week should be ashamed of themselves. Buying and holding the S&P on a weekly basis would have given you better returns than that.

I’m not sure what the logic would be of someone putting $31,000 into a single put on a 20% IV underlying would be considering you could get twice as much return on a cheaper stock with less investment
Fuck my life I had the chance to take train to AAPL or train to BIDU and I took the wrong train
we are in the same boat my friend
Nio is looking good
Why are you still holding AXXA?  Whatever they is...
Ouch. We hurting out here.
I like simple colors, so a dark red is from me. Can't compare to light blue though. Yeah, and then there is light dark blue, quite possibly my favorite of all.
No Theta on weekends...

Or so I was told and downvoted heavily for when I said something about weekend Theta the other day..

But it's a mental thing and surely any time makes the difference, not like stocks stand still over the weekend.
only due to Homelander
Yes a full half day

This dudes gonna jump out of window when tesla dumps on the 4th when people start closing out their gains they didn't want to hit in 2020. 

Good luck, bro. I hope I'm wrong.
Where’s my platinum, retards?
Tf is this shit? I’ve been scrolling non-stop and there isn’t a single comment without an award.
I knew we were a bunch of retards, but who could have predicted this level of retardedness smh
No, this is Patrick
I like Cathie Wood but the chances she outperforms the market like she has over a long period are pretty low. The research on this stuff is readily accessible.
Yeah I agree that $5k is too low - 10 or 20 would be a better lower limit. I get that people like to show off their positions, but I personally don't find moves that small very interesting, especially given how many gain/loss posts get thrown up here.

I'd also add a percentage rule to get rid of the $1mm accounts bragging about a $200k gain. yawn, you made 20%, good for you.  Maybe 50-100% gain minimum.
Damn bruh you trying to bankrupt me
 
Edit: Wish I had the cheese to buy more actually, because I would, because I'm fucking retarded and I love money!!
CFDs would be even cooler because leverage 😎

Shares. Although I don’t understand Leaps.
So I’m positive that the market makers are using WSB rocket emoji tickers to sell calls on whatever prices they post for their FD’s . 
You guys better change your collective strategy or keep getting screwed

They don’t have to carry all PC components. Just the ones that are relevant to consoles. Cables and SSDs come to mind.
So 1% a week, compounded weekly for a year? That's insanely good returns....
I literally just googled how to give an award to give this post an award
guesses about how market will react to GA election Jan 5th? Dems taking two seats unlikely but what if they pull it off? If they don't, do we just keep rising well into Biden's inauguration?

VIX trend this past year has been a major pull back every 3-4 months. We're about due on that metric. Not sure how aggressive I should be in my positions
If you went all in on one stonk in 2021, what’s the play?
I want to autist you so badly rn
Aight.  Made money in March on DRIP.  Lost it all chasing puts on the Q's.  Also sold the 100 July 21 GME $5 C for a minor profit in July, rather than diamond handing.  What have I learned?  Chasing the dragon has it's highs and lows.

yes buy GME
Omg who gives those awards?
Cool just became rich
It's like the second coming
It's a shame that there are no interesting Russian stonks, Putin memes are cool
I meant that the risk is less dependent on upwards price action, i.e. a lower breakeven at expiration. If it stays flat you gain slightly, but pay a higher premium than the higher strikes. So yes, you're risking more money per contract, but you have a higher probability of being ITM hence less risk on price action. If you would buy the spreads for the same amount of dollars the higher strikes are by definition more risky to get a gain.

she didnt ask about eter yet tho
Hmmm dont know about that one it seemed pretty bullish, im sure he’d want cheaper prices but he bought at 16$ and i dont see how that tweet would drive prices down
how though, didn't it go up to 690+ today? did you pick something over 700 or 800
Calls on that horse for its strength.
buy shares tomorrow
This is the most retarded yet awesome thing I’ve ever seen. Life complete.
Baba going the wrong way again. Fuck.
I love how he took down Gawker for outing him. A beautiful $140M fuck you.
Good call
He’s a chad. I would buy more shares but I already bought every  share I could 🚀🚀🚀

Remember to 🙌💎
I did not know that. My mind is honestly blown right now
What’s the ticker btw?
Cohen tweet is to help reduce price b4 he buys more stock. He's buying next week expect the price to increase
Sold my TSLA share yesterday for a chance at buying for 694.20 today
Bidu, what a miss.... 😢
All stocks and options are is a combination of volume and interest at certain inflection points , just a premium being paid on level of interest and volume as well as price

Supply and demand
This post was what I needed to wake up to this morning... time to load up on more GME I think
[deleted]
>PSTH - What do you have to lose?

35% roughly, given that's how much you're overpaying for a pile of shares that each represent $20 in escrow. 

In terms of spacs in general it's a hugely frothy valuation driven by the weird structure Ackman invented to benefit himself. It artificially inflates the price of both the warrants and the stock for the time being, although during the merger some of that will get flushed out since the warrant count will triple.
just here to collect my reward thx
Why do you think there will be volatility?
Play both and u always come out on top
GME les go
Volume and interest .
Yeah. Even bigger businesses like Walmart and Target had to limit their sales if that location used FedEx.
I know it's a joke, but there's currently a spac looking to merge with a company in the video game/streaming industry, lead by the former CEO of Jagex
You get paid in Nikola plushies toys that they're selling for five bucks on their site. Tweet replies are gold.
Stocks are all volume man
Retards here gain or lose literal hundreds of thousands in weeks and this motherfucker is getting pocket money.
Why
45 PLTR 35 NIO 100 ARKG is what I’ve bought this month

No volume dude , everyone is interested in spacs doggy
That type of dedication you can tell your divorce attorney about and hope for reduced alimony later in court.

If GME gets battered today that’s the dip to buy.
It's not Xmas retard. The meme is accurate tho
Not really anything to be educated on i just was looking for explanations on why the lack of volume. It could be for many reasons. Its not like its 2+2=4 and im refusing to read how to add retard
How do I get rewards
back to nasdaq leading. these gay rotations are everyday now
This is a Wsb indicator to get out of riot soon and rotate to Mara lol
it’s a bull market you 🌈 🐻

The amount of retards shitting on PSTH makes me confident.
5000 shares and like 30k in 3/21 calls
Awards...awards everywhere !!
i don't understand why people say to pay the most attention while trading options. Is there something i can't see?
Ppl are selling calls I guess
I've never understood how people say something with a higher max loss is less risk.  I get that the probability is better.. Probability is not the same ask risked cash.

20/35 Max profit 1030 - max loss 470 - breakeven 24.70

25/35 max profit 785 - max loss 215 - breakeven 27.15

So the only way this is "less risk" is that the breakeven is lower..

Edit: also 2:1 vs almost 4:1 risk/reward..
red and green are universal colors

Specialists on CNBC absolutely did not mention a thing about huge potential of Ryan Cohen. Sure one mentioned about beginning of the console cycle, but absolutely nothing about RC, who will revolutionise GameStop soon. Once he'll have enough shares he'll come out with his plan and this will be definitely something big compared to current GS strategy. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Tesla would be nonexistent without Elon. Let that sink in.

💎👐
went all cash yesterday. gonna look at some eod calls. made money on tsla and sq this week but dont see a good play right now. hopefully some profit taking and some good dips to get in on.
How much shares you holding now
This is my 2nd international flight in 2 months.  Way more packed this trip, but that prob has to do with holidays.

Haven’t flown domestic since May.

Overall everything runs smoother because less people.
wait, so if you just post here you get an award?
Of course there's always a risk, but given the upcoming catalyst of the announcement, the risk/reward seems very promising. It's also weird that it trades at such a high premium, makes me think that a lot of investors don't wanna sell until the news hits. It might drop if the target is really shitty, but I doubt that will be the case.
Lmao! “Gamestonk” no bro just been sleeping pretty late for the past 3 weeks idk why

You seem to be smoking some really good shit if you believe that eu markets will legalise anytime soon. 

Most of the countries already have the shit decriminalised and that is more profitable than having it legal.

My 2k GME shares are happy
YTD 17.11% TWR, 24.42% MWR

No massive wins. Just grateful I survived.

Lessons learnt

1. TSLA - don't listen to fearmongers even if it's papa Elon ("TSLA stock too high imo") Don't even look at twitter. Just look at options chain. Buy 90 day calls. Avoid weeklies, and don't play into earnings call (biggest loss of 2020, $7236 on Tesla July earnings week).
2. 2020 Politics - buying too many puts because "A Joe Biden victory will cause a stock market crash of which the likes we've never seen before". Politics don't matter. Don't read the news. Stonks only go up. Buy calls.
3. BA - selling after reading multiple headlines of cancelled orders, virus uptick, and Gyna blacklisting Boeing. More cancellations, more infections, more hospitalizations, more dead people is hella bullish and means higher travel and airline stocks. Buy calls.
4. BABA - Using Boeing proceeds to buy BABA leading up to Ant Group IPO. Never overestimate the man who underestimates himself. CEOs and founders aren't perfect. They can do stupid shit too. Fuck you Jack. But I'm still rooting for BABA. Buy calls.
5. Masayoshi Son belongs in this sub.
6. Meme stocks are the way. And bankrupt companies too. 
7. Buy calls.

Happy new year all
I don't think he is deliberately pumping and dumping. He just shares his ticker and people follow.

My broker doesn't allow to trade such fresh SPACs so I wasn't able to buy some, but I wanted to, at least for quick in and out.

I don't know about STIC. It does seem like a good bet though, but in long term. Short term it's still SPAC, and that might be pretty volatile. Get yourself a target price, and no matter what sell at this price. You can always return later.

That’s why I love this subreddit. Some real fucking inverse logic going on here. Enough with the awards! Makes it hard to even read the comments
Janurally
Is trading 30% over its NAV so that is the amount you risk to lose. No deal or one that investment firms don't like and everyone who bought late is getting burnt. If you believe Bill Ackman does this with us retail in mind and won't try to dump it on us you belong here.
Oh and as extra fuck you:

Almost more awards than comments. That's crazy.
lol? I get to buy shares at $20 while collecting your premium. Literally win win for me. 🌈🐻
Sold at $900 pre-split because I felt it was overvalued
Can we please just get a 3% trend day to the upside?
$34k --> $205k in the IRA.  $0 --> $50k in the taxable account (used a $18k balance transfer to seed that one; $50k is what's cleared).  A pretty insane year that I'll never repeat.  Shares, ETFs, options, SPACs.  Trading helped make 2020 less shitty and I haven't actually told anyone about it.  Proof: https://imgur.com/a/kk7Nq8A

Learned plenty.  Here  are a few things: 
1) Risk management (yeah, I know what sub this is) - I had some plays that sucked hard (oil, REITs, most of my close-to-expiry calls) but they weren't too damaging since most wagers weren't more than like 5% of portfolio, usually less.
2) Learn SPACs.  Some serious money to be made there.  These boards are populated with clowns pumping their play, but seeing beyond that and getting into SPAC plays early on is pretty doable. 
3) Find plays by reading the front page...not the biz news.  I stumbled into some nice plays just by reading news items and thinking about how they could make me tendies.  Read a bit about gene editing and was buying ARKG when it was like $30.  Read about COVID testing and bought some DGX options that printed hard. Etc.  

Long: TSLA, SBE, Cathie, solar, Chamath, plant-based stuff

They have released Cloudflare pages too. While Netlify/Vercel etc. aren't big players yet in tech/web (still in the millions rather than billions), they do have big players involved, including funding from a GitHub founder and also from the current GitHub CEO. The GitHub founder is even working on a website generator in that space.

I think opposite. Dump at open n we crawl back to green eod
Couldn't agree more, that dip buying opportunity of a lifetime mantra everyone had back in may had me nervous because everyone so cocky this would blow over in a month or two.  I am pretty new to participating in the stock market, but my grandpa is an expert at timing.  Sold everything on feb 18th.  Something he always tell me is "If something seems like free money, that's exactly when you lose it"  He called me yesterday to tell me he just sold it all
And what someone might pay for it depends on the company’s financials.

And good luck doubling the volume, without causing a spike in price.  Keep in mind Cohen has been part of the average volume, and he can’t sell for 6 months.  So that’s tied up.

Shitty premiums? Even a stock with mean IV is going to have decent premium 45 days out at .4 delta. He's right you know. Just pick a delta on a high IV stock and sell 30-45 days out. Thats pretty much it.
I’m balls deep in Nio but my coworkers Chinese gf had only heard of Li. Xpev is way overpriced. Could be Nio or could be Li though.
Awards don't grow on trees
I don’t think a comparison is necessary. It has its own way of going its course away from the expectations and predictions of the general opinion. To be defined only by the presumptions of others. If this has a positive or negative conotation lays with the beholder.

Meanwhile, the target date fund in my Roth IRA is up 30% for the year....

In total, with new money added every paycheck, I went from around $120K invested to around $210K.

In addition to playing more options, I also wish I could have been smart enough to just buy 3x leveraged ETFs at the bottom in March. Seems like an easy way to make 5-10X. Maybe I'll be able to do that next time we have a ridiculously fast V-shaped recovery from a major global event.

Just to add to this, you can use the existing locomotive bodies when converting to overhead traction; essentially all you're doing is swapping out the prime mover for a switch cabinet full of electronics.  The cab stays the same, the traction motors stay the same, the bogies stay the same.  
Many places around the world use electric locomotives for freight haulage, so this is a solved problem if the right incentives are in place (or barriers removed).

2,300 comments and almost as many awards Lmaoo you got dam retards
i started the year with 600k.... ... year before I started with 300k.   I have all of my money in 1 or 2 stocks.

I spent way too much time looking at globex and european futures for precious metals and not enough time sleeping.  I've been swing trading miners and sometimes oil companies for nearly \~4 years as well as a few other trades on what most would call boomer stocks......   My account is close to 1.5 million right now which includes maybe 50k this year from actually working... up 850k or so this year so far.  its been a great year and completely crazy, i almost want to take a year off work just to enjoy it as I'm mentally drained due to everything thats happened this year, but my day job is really good so I wont.  I don't buy options and only ever sold covered calls.... I'm already in commodity producers which are leveraged to whatever they make.  Watching my account go up or down 80-90k some days i've become numb to.

I've learned 2 things the last few years that I didn't know the first 10 years or so that I had a brokerage account.  Keep doing what you believe in, and sell when wallstreet bets gets way too excited about something.
You are so fucking stupid. The fact that we’re losing this many people everyday is literally proof it’s not a matter of fucking outliers you autist take a fucking intro stat class. 

Honestly congrats buddy you win, I can’t argue with you it’s just depressing me too much. Your comments are an indictment of the American education system. This is fucking pathetic, no wonder the world is laughing at us.

I really hope you’re fucking proud of yourself. Your cock must be so huge, not wearing a piece of fucking cloth over your face. You giant fucking baby. You’re gonna be part of the reason we have to deal with this shit for years to come.
Drop XL and scoop the Canoo dip
Correct! They will get gobbled up for this tho. Them we cash in bigly.
I will swallow my own shit if GME hits $50 by February.
THANK YOU, that dip is phenomenal as well
Me with my 9
I have a cousin who dabbles in the market. Whenever I tell him about the newest meme stock and ridiculously speculative positions I have he just laughs... meanwhile he just looks at charts and buys when he sees the golden cross on boomer shit.
Can I get an award too for no reason
Sector rotation into BIDU
Yea but if you think about breakdowns of decades, the 80s, the 90s, the 00s etc you include year zero. The 2020s include the year 2020 and the 2010s ended in 2019
If the squeeze happen tomorrow there is a new buy in the matrix

I like BEAM.  Its base editing, which I think is better than regular CRISPR because it doesn't require breaking the double strands.
Oh Rocket, you were destined to moon but all you did was stagnate
just need 100 times the price of a stock in case you get assigned

so you need like 2.5k to start selling naked puts on palantir

Find an interview with him.
Easily rolling covered calls on PLTR up to higher strikes during the big run up weeks. One week I made like 2.7k (3.5k CAD). That's like a 10% return in a week, which is absolutely nuts as far as selling options is concerned. Honestly I suppose my strategy is less thetagang and more vegagang, but whatever.

Today, I'm going to write as many calls as possible. I think it will be a boring day as everyone expects a sell-off in January. Literally free money imo.
Started at $60,000, dropped down to $40,000, ending at $60,900. Should have stuck to AAPL🤡
So very true, yet a few strokes to finish is better than FOMOing into a spent load.

**These are not the bags you're looking for.**
😂 you chased the green and got the rainbow 🌈
Up $40k. The last two days took me down from up $60k. 

Most gains from TSLA, and EV. Didn't even start until I got some solid capital in Sept. Was rolling with $100k account.

Biggest loss is PLTR though I haven't realized it yet. **Biggest lesson is to alway always always buy on a red day. They will always come, no matter how big the hype. And when they do come they are large discounts.**

Also learned SPACS at NAV, CCs, and CSPs for less risky gains.

Eh a little dillution once you are up a shit ton isn't such a huge deal. A buying opprtunity if anything. Hopefully this hits double digit. Its technology is more effective and cheaper than its competitor which has about 11 times the market cap
Hundreds. My best was CCJ calls right before they broke out in December was up to 45k. Doubled my account in early November with weed stocks. Lost a decent amount in the last couple weeks.

If you account sales tax, property tax, tax on gas etc etc, probably like 40% for the average person. Just a random guess. Lowest federal income tax rate is 15%.

I hope for humanity's sake that the revolution happens. As someone in academics myself, I know that labs doing work that is 'potentially world changing' are a dime a dozen. In most cases there is a catch of some sort which makes the work completely inapplicable in the real world (in hardware, due to the costs being prohibitive, in biology, due to adverse effects beyond the narrow thing being studied). People don't worry about it too much, the PIs get a grant and a Nature paper, the media writes a puff piece, and life moves on. CRISPR for example, has been shown to have low specificity, i.e., there are collateral changes to the genetic material which are not part of the design, and not well understood. It's not to say that these things can't be solved, but the average Joe putting in their life savings based on Cathie Wood parroting the grant applications might not be aware of the risks. Again I'm not saying that it is a bad investment, I'm just saying that these things are riskier than people imagine.
A man has fallen into the river in Lego City.
Unless we are wrong and the dips a week later. Traditionally the rally is the last weeks of Dec and the first week or so of Jan. Who knows! I also got covered calls, so there is that. Cash gang could rekt me. On the bright side if we dip my covered calls end up printing.
Or move to Ukraine and hire 2 PhD's.
Nah
Let me add to this ratio

Not an expert. Will be running all month and I'm mostly excited about the ARKG talks.

Not happy about issuing more shares once hitting 4 to 5, will get a pullback and then rocket if ARKG on board, by that time 8 will let my original 9nvestment ride and I would have taken my profits elsewhere.

I got wrecked by BA around that time.
I had been buying right at close and selling right at open for a quick 2-3% pop.

Decided to size up to 25K in FD's, swung overnight and Trump closed a Chinese Embassy. BA gapped down I think 8% overnight, and finished -18% that day.

Took me a while to re-gain my trading confidence after that one TBH. Never touching BA again.
everyone comment in this thread get reward?
No those were just my top earners, as I said there was manyx3 more. Only options, I obviously have bought shares now in mostly clean energy ETFS
Woke up to this retardness. Gang GME go!
You think the queen dying will be that big of a deal?
At least you have a roof over yer head
Yes and Yes
Anyone wanna calculate how many shares of GME you can buy with all that money spent on the awards in this post? Seriously curious.
I would. Wtf am I gonna do ignore someone at 4am?
I have 21 different positions on 13 different companies all expiring tomorrow. Bought all of them yesterday and this is going to be a mess to close all of them tomorrow at decent times, but I really only need one of them to run for me to at least break even. SQ and BIDU already went ITM not long after purchasing them yesterday but I have a feeling my puts are going to be the ones printing

I almost never buy FDs but AMZN calls blessed me this week and I spent over 1k of profits on lottery tickets that i'm probably going to regret. Great way to end 2020
This is insane. I love it

Happy New years Eve you fucking retards
If you’re not confident enough to go bear just go all cash. Worst case you miss one day of gains. Best case is you get to buy a huge dip

How many shares and what's your average? I've got 2.5k shares at $33 average.

What would you do if someone knocked on your door right now in the middle of the night and when you answered they were in a phone call on speaker phone saying they need you to settle an argument between them and their friend about whether it's always dumb to pay $20 a g for weed or sometimes you gotta do it
Ah yes the "Grease trap" quality lube.
They’re paying down debts, unwinding their legacy technology, while investing in fiber and edge computing. I think it has upside, with a 10 percent dividend as a backstop. I’m generally bullish on dividend stocks in 2021. I think if and when scared money comes off the sidelines a lot goes to dividend stocks.
Options sellers.

Please tell me you're like -80% overall this year or I might cry a little.
I love democracy.
But how does it work? Does dark pool exchanges just hoard inventories of stocks? Or are there 2 parties involved in that as well - buyers and sellers.
Damn that looks legit from years back too

You mentioned they had only 3-4 competitors and now you’ve already acknowledged Tesla, Li, Xpeng, BYD, Toyota, Nissan, and GM. You’re still missing some of the biggest like VW. So that’s already 8, twice as many as you claim exist without even delving into BMW, Hyundai, Honda, Mercedes, and many Chinese companies. For many drivers they might consider an electric pickup which adds even more competitors to the mix.
Only seen pictures of tendie town 🥺, can’t wait for Nio to finally bring me there 🤑🤑
You’re proving my point, I seriously made you mad to the point you’ll stalk my profile to deflect from the fact you’re acting like a pussy? You’re probably the same dude bitching from a few days ago too lol. Calling my account new when yours is a year old is hilarious, this sub started to go downhill when dumbasses like you joined. Keyboard warriors are the kind of people who go around whining about the rules so its ironic you’d use that term. It takes two seconds to reply to you man, and you cant even spell the word imagine you fucking ape. You’re going to get the same response from pretty much anyone here if you keep bitching about rules :P
I’ve been working out the past 5 months in a crowded gym where nobody wears masks and I never take any precautions, at the beginning of the year I worked in a public setting and came in contact with everyone and nothing has ever happened to me. You know why bc I’m in good health? You guys love to single out the one or two persons you know that magically had Covid and all the symptoms like it means anything. There’s always outliers buddy. Most men can take fucking viagra no problem but others can’t. Does that mean ban viagra for everyone? No, just warn those people what happens if they do. Same with your tyrannical lockdowns and masks that don’t even help by the way
Looks like at least some of the retards on here claiming to have hundreds of thousands of dollars, actually do!

Either that, or you can now buy Reddit awards on margin.

6k+ started with 1200: slv just before it took off in the summer: knew little to nothing about individually investing. Boomer 401k until this year. Got lucky and caught the metals surge. Diamond handed from up 32k at ath back down to 6k before I got out. Realized about October November that this is not something to just yolo:) small positions with gains taken. Currently in pltr shitcoin and mining stocks. Can’t seem to get away from metals completely:) have become the permabear I am today watching everything that’s happened this year and fully expect next year to be even wilder:) love you guys best of luck to everyone in 21:) Take profits, hedge and less yolo is my current plan:)

People who think GME is overvalued, haven't looked at CRWD yet. Monthly puts are free money imo. At some point this bubble will burst too.

Where’s the golden fuckboy???🚀🚀🚀🚀
Started the year with about $3k USD and about 2-3k in spare computer parts I ended up liquidating

Ended the year with $15,700.

37% gains over the last 3 weeks when I started actively investing and managing my money while I've been home over winter break (I'm a college senior)

- Currently long holding 0.22 BTC (bought at $21.7k)
- 184 shares of GME (bought at $18.50)
- 50 shares of GBTC (bought at $27.31)

I also make some money on the side building people custom gaming computers so that's helped generate a bit more capital to keep throwing at stonks
That's why I'm asking...

My gamble ain’t paying off
My TSLA calls are fucked aren’t they
Im starting to get that 'running into the woodchipper' feeling we had back in february.  Dems win Georgia = tax increase = moderate selloff but we get stimmy.  Reps win = Mitch = No stimmy.  There are multiple bubbles that have been in the making for years ready to pop; pharma, corporate debt, whatever the fuck Nikola was. And on top of that I have crazy trump relatives that have been waiting their entire lives to kamikaze themselves against the jewish controlled media or something.  The most convincing thing though is that even bringing up buying a long range put is seen as lighting $ on fire
Hey is this still going on. Got no cash for stocks or awards.. gimme gimme one

Thanks, hny to you too.  
I lived in shanghai for 4 years and witnessed the alibaba dominance, similar to amazon in the US.  it will get back up, is actually undervalued at these levels, but as long as we have China and US regulators taking more interest, this could be sideways for a while.
I may role my positions out 6 months but also aware investing in china (non EV) has risk.  
Tough call

Edit - am a boomer
yeah man im 35 and i have only been taking 401k. i'm kicking myself at how many years i missed out on the annual roth contribution. I didn't realize one can take out the contribution penalty free until a few months ago. Do you actively manage as one would do with their regular portfolio? Seems like a great place to trade options and collect dividends.
Get in on BILI guys
Goodnight Gentlemen,

Don’t stare at the futures too long 🚀
The level of autism is pretty high even for this sub Jesus Christ. First of all, you’re drawing two completely different comparisons. I’m comparing numbers, you’re comparing literal sentiment. Yes no one asked for 9/11 and yes I agree those who fought in ww2 are heroes, like what, are actually challenged? 

My sister in law had covid last week from working in the covid unit in her hospital. She has no prior health conditions and apart from me is probably the healthiest person in my immediate family. She was absolutely fucked, luckily she pulled through and is currently recovering. It’s selfish, uneducated pieces of shit like you that are the reason my family and millions of other families with health care workers have to go through this shit.

Like I said, soon you’ll get what’s coming to you. Reinfections are a thing and are only going to increase in number from here. Good luck, asshole.

Thanks retards
up 10k overall, mostly on TQQQ weeklies.  slowed way down by the september-october dip.  staying away from the ATH this time, funds stashed in PSTH.  good luck out there.

Guys it’s happening! Futures red! That means Green by open!!!
If I sell a RIOT 02/05 19c and buy a 02/05 18c tastyworks says my maximum profit per contract is 70$ and its max loss 30$. I mean imo RIOT will hit 19-20 easily mid January.
I know that my max profit is capped, but what am I missing? It sounds too good. I read you want low IV on a debit spread cause you have a max profit anyway. Than I read high IV doesn't matter much on debit spreads. Pls help me boys, I'm confused right know
Started the year at 8k went to a high of 82k during March with puts. And never got out of my 🏳️‍🌈🐻 ways and account slowly kept dropping. Ended up blowing up my account and reloaded another 1k and now I'm at 9k. So ending 2020 at breakeven for the year. Here's hoping 2021 goes better 🍻
Can you buy some GME shares and calls and sell immediately to pump it up for the rest of us?

Hey I can get down with that
I mean, you’re sorta right and I agree that 9/11 was someone attacking us whereas getting covid is somewhat on you. 

There is an argument to be had about people’s livelihoods and not everyone has the option to stay inside. But not one I feel like making rn lol

At the end of the day there isn’t anything we can do about people with conditions getting covid and dying other than telling them to stay inside
Yes. You should buy some.
No comments awards please. BUY THE FUCKING DIP EOY!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

How do you know they were doing the buybacks the last 2 days? I would assume they will spread it out
Ahaa yes, that darn pandemic!
 XPEV will release deliver 5000+ car next Monday, which is a total delivered more than 12274 in Q4， which is 22% more than the Q4 guidelines of 10000. Also, XPEV has more profit in selling P7 than G3. so the Q4 ER will be really bullish. Also, XPEV will video live auto drive the whole journey from Guangzhou to Beijing (1500 miles away) in Q1 2021( Febrary). hold strong long!!!

Microeconomics 101. Never short a bubble, even when it's clear it's a bubble .... It's literally almost impossible to time it. And writing naked calls and shorting shares is a recipe for disaster ... You could just have bought long dated puts. Anyway, good luck, you surely have balls. I reckon it's a good time to enter a net short position, but who knows
The secret ingredient is crime
Learned so much this year. So many good learning experiences. Now I am 100x better than I was in the beginning of 2020.

That big short has to cover today.

I didn't buy GME when it was at $4/share so now I'm begging for reddit tendies like a bum standing in the median at a stop light.
Clearly you have no idea what I said buddy. Media only ever shows the number of dead people which in a world with so many unhealthy fucks like you there's MANY. Even with that the number of people who contract this virus and nothing happens to them is 100 times the number of people who end up in the hospital. You're just brainwashed and fear mongered to death by CBS News. The only scary story is your state governments taking away your freedom and forcing your business to close forever. Clown.
same definitely because of the pandemic
The ones that you'll buy at open and cuss because they expire worthless at market close.

Stahp talking about GME. Someone posted a thing about how GME goes down as the posts go up. Don’t buy GME on robinhood or on Margin accounts.
 This is the most awards I’ve ever seen. Hopefully it’s a reddit record and now the record is held by this wonderful, beautiful subreddit.
Is this a pump and dump? I need some DD about future of the company

Fair, but I bought at 44. Not only did it rip yesterday, its looking like it’s gonna rip again today

I didn’t pay too much attention to it, but now there is something fucking weird in between my nail and my skin. It’s not an ingrown nail cuz I cut my nails recently. It’s some kind of weird skin that grew in between my nail and my normal skin.

That's such an idiotic statement. No one asked for planes to fly into towers those people didn't have a choice but everyone dying from Covid had the choice to stay home or have better health instead of being unhealthy slobs. Imagine comparing heroes who charged into Normandy for your freedom to people who just sat around and ate Doritos for their whole lives then died bc their heart couldn't handle a virus with a 0.01% kill rate. I'm not taking any vaccine because I don't need it. Go ahead and be the guinea pig clown or have a strong immune system like me, that's my vaccine.
PSTH price action looking extremely bullish today
\+49.6% ytd (+15,879.60 CAD), started trading in September. Wish I picked up options trading years ago. All my profit is from thetagang plays, as the few options I have bought have all lost me money. For those curious, most of that money came from running the wheel on PLTR, but I did make money for awhile doing the same on AMD and TSM. GME gang is my next play.
Never bad to take some profits! Thanks I’m hoping I can pull off 100% return🤞. I’ll have to check it out this is the first time I’ve heard of them.

SRAC will hit $30 no matter what. Sadly, I sold $17.50 covered calls when it was $14... I’m sitting here getting cucked watching the stock go up but not profiting because it went past the strike price.
Except we never locked down retard. We had a half assed cluster fuck with shifty participation and bad messaging. 

Nobody wants to admit that the best reaction to getting this under control was what the Asian countries did. NZ and AU as well. Not even close  to the numbers we have. 

If you call that a shut down and if you think the USA didn’t/continues to completely clusterfuck the response to this domestically, you have a rude awakening when you move out of your parents basement and get a real job. 

Everyone knows the “freedom/overall stats” Downplayer people are arrogant fucking retards. You know nothing.

This is like 200 awards from becoming the most awarded post on Reddit. 

I love you retards
Congrats to you bidu is up a lot after hours already, should of held in hindsight but pretty excited for what b n g o is gonna do pull off. I never play penny stocks but this Lowkey be giving me nio flashbacks lol
So sad. It went from being the biggest blockbuster of the year to the biggest bust. I dumped Boeing at 158 for BABA at 263 only to end 2020 in the red 😔

Anyway, good luck and all the best to you BABA bro. We will rise again! And happy NY
Using this for my Tinder profile. Letting the ladies know that they’ll be the one chasing the bread 😎
Damnit. These threads always happen while EU is asleep. Screw you retards
Will BABA reach 275 anytime soon? Jesus Christ I’ve been bagholding for months now. Just wanna slap a bitch whenever I look at this shit stock lol
Feels like I'm in some twilight zone seeing all these platinums.
LOL I OPENED THE POST AND LAUGHED STRAIGHT AWAY.

I got 20k stashed as security and have a steady job, hence why I went all in. Rather not loosing 10k though, prefer to gain it, as we all do. But it's looking better, just a rough few days ahead
Why I didn’t buy more ARCT at that bottom, I can’t say
Tradestation global man, they rock!
Started my account very LATE this year in September, wish I started back in march. But i'm at 13.6k as of now with some aggressive investing and 20% up all time.

Why not just eat gold? Atleast you can salvage that investment.

All those name add-ons indicate this man has a Ph.D in losing money.
125k gain this year, my best year yet. Mostly from apple stock. Biggest loss was a 10k loss on moderna, but I’m glad I cut that early before the even bigger drop. Lessons learned: just long apple, never touch pharmaceuticals, never go all in on the first drop, drops happen usually 3 days in a row before recovery.
Dont look at the standard deviation but rather at the variance
Repeat after me. Green. By. Open.
Thinking of picking up a ton of Dis, not sure if I can time a dip before earnings in January
The most 2020 thing would be a violent selloff today to end the year.
Yes.
Put it into GME and be actually useful to the human race for once. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Noob here, +1.8K (euros) (+20%) since starting my journey in November this year off stocks and CFDs only. I really want to get into US options this coming year but I'm not sure if it's possible to trade them from Europe.

What does the P stand for
nio day is next week. If you wanna be apart of hype BUY NIO . idk if it goes up or down but it sure will provide a rush.
When do ppl will realise it s not abour the virus or vaccine anymore. It s about money printing and interest rates. If fed stops printing then u will see a crash.orhetwise new all time high

1.6k awards. Holy fuck. My Reddit app almost crashed because of all that animation.
BABA opening at 300 😍
People on WSB say “how did you not make money this month” are retarded. Almost 90% of open interest option contracts expire worthless. Those people will lose money eventually, or they’re the lucky 1% that consistently make money with options. 

I cried about ETSY for months. Months I tell you. Took nearly 4 months for my January 2021 $150 calls to actually be profitable. And don’t get me started on FB, it’s going poorly
What if gamestop was cooking the books like that one Chinese coffee company.....we'd be so fucked collectively.

Man like seriously first time I see so many 50000 coins awards. Who tf pays so much to give someone an award??
Customers and their mothers are fucking stupid. If you believe Lex Luthor believes in customer service you must believe he pays his employees well. True money making businesses is not about customer service but how much you can fuck and squeeze out of your employees without breaking your expenses

LUMN could see a nice pump in the next few weeks. Currently trading in the lower end of its range , Dog of the S&P, tax loss harvesting on it recently, Supposed to be on Mad Money next week, Michael Burry has a bunch. Probably going with shares because the dividend is crazy.
Congrats! I just opened a 11k call position today [BIDU ](https://imgur.com/a/tXyy2bW)
Dip
Retard moment here I come.
https://i.imgur.com/LN9qXGl.png

Welp, started the year at $44,000 (up from the $35k I funded my Robinhood account with) and ending up at $104,150. That last spike is me lucking out by listening to the commentariat here and going in on PLTR and NIO calls in November: 

* 30 PLTR shares @ $17.54
* 240 PLTR shares @ $14.58
* 3x PLTR $15c 1/15/21 @ $2.15
* 5x PLTR $16c 2/19/21 @ $2.89
* 3x NIO $22c 2/19/21 @ $4.70 (On Oct 12)

You can tell pretty clearly when I started messing with memelord wsb options, but I can't say I'm sad that I did.

Some wins with NET, PTON, UPS, NIO, DIS, and WORK finally paid me a _bit_ but I bought in at the IPO and held on that so nowhere near what I could've realized. 

Some _significant_ regrats selling 20 shares of TSLA in November of 2019 and 10 shares in January. Ugh. Considering I drive one of the damn cars and generally believe in the company, I don't know why I was ever swing trading it, but just... ugh...

I never had the balls to enter a YOLO position. All of my trades were < $10k.

And also got burned on plenty of dumbass options that expired with worthless diamond hands.

My reflection is: if you really believe in a company, just buy and hold and don't look at it. Set a separate budget for YOLO/FD/meme plays but keep tending the buy-and-hold garden. Also really _really_ regretting not buying a bunch more BTC in March when it cratered. I barely have 0.6BTC and I should have more. (Separately, regretting buying 0.1BTC 7 years ago today and dumping it on a BTC dice game instead of holding... that $70 purchase would be worth $2900 today. Gah.)
💀
So that's like 1000 to 2400% per year for ark. Say no more, all in

So you posted a hyper aggressive thing about YOLOs and then in tiny print mention how you've "YOLOd" into a SPAC, with a "floor" at $20, that is run by the best fund manager since buffet. Fuck outta here. r/investing would love you.

**For every award on this reply, $GME is guaranteed up $0.01 tomorrow.**
We need you brave warrior. Today's seems like a good day to enter the battle again
Why not GME :(? Would be the ultimate confirmation bias I need
Baba buy back program supported the price the last 2 days... not any unknown or unexpected good news.  Once the buy back is done, expect the price to continue to try to find equilibrium... which is below these levels.  
Im long 260 and 290 calls bought a couple months ago so i am not hating, just speaking from facts.
I think 211 could be tested if continued bad news comes, if not, 230ish could be equilibrium for a while
I’m in because of this comment no Dd necessary
Way to be a stereotype

People getting sick because they couldn't be responsible enough to stay home, social distance, and wear a mask, especially if they are around at risk people, is not my problem. That's a personal decision. 9/11 was an attack by terrorists. Different situation.

You know you have an uncontrollable gambling problem when you log on to see other peoples luck lmao. I'm checking here before my own portfolio this morning.
The dip on Monday was the best time to do that (this week) but you'll still be good for NIO Day run up.

It wasn't Buffet and the big banks scooping up the bottom in the spring and early summer.
what the fuck is bidu
God you just hurt my brain. You realize we’re losing a 9/11’s worth of people everyday now right? We’re well over the American deaths in ww2. It’s ok though honestly this is good for America, those that get the vaccine will and those that won’t won’t. We’re finally going to rid ourselves of the religious and foolish. I guess it’s honestly true what trump said, he really is about to make America great again, one way or the other ☠️
Lol at all you retards posting just to try and get awards, those rich dudes fucked their model girlfriends and went to sleep
are you selling CC on PSTH?

noticed you selling PLTR CC for 1/22.  why the weeklies and not the monthly? what are your plans for PLTR if it breaches the strike? Roll ?

Nice! I hope SunPower rides the news train too. I've loved ENPH ever since I opened my RH account last February but for some reason I sold my shares late spring...oh well. I bought some JAN and FEB calls a couple weeks ago, hopefully they print today
I have a bridge to sell to anyone who wastes money on reddit gift awards
ok hunny
They need to be showing bodies. Thousands and thousands of bodies on tv. Prime time. 

I wonder what a pile of 3k bodies looks like? I can’t even imagine what 1k looks like. 

Probably end of Jan id love for everyone to see 5k bodies. It’s like 10 747s going down in one day!!! Not only is it a “scary story” its more like a horror show that is it’s actually real! Haha. 

Get over yourself gay bear clown. It’s a real story and it will continue to be.
“” meaning he’s quoting them. The shock face due to him being “amazed” that they could ever think such a thing, not.

We’re just giving retail too much credit they like would have done it themselves without some proper framing and incentives such as a $1200 check...
in the kitchen you go
💯
Yeah idk if I should sell if I’m up or hold though for a day or two, gonna set a stop loss regardless because I am really bad at selling options when I profit
Probably. I bought calls when it was around $5. Sold some on the run up. Holding what I have left just to see what happens. Hoping it makes it's way to $20 over the next few months.
Drilling to the moon? 🥺
Thank you chocolate man we will get rich together brother.

congrats!
But some were young and fine lol
Skip class, eat ass.

Long distance is trash. Mulligan.
I sold for 20k extra gain tdy and sold my position for bi0nan0 and took the rest of the money out for taxes. Time to do 25k to 100k over again
I fucking hope so good god 🙏🙏🙏
Nobody made this argument for, say, 9-11.
ya but if it doesnt have enough bids then its gonna be a partial fill
That's pretty reasonable. Mine has a new one every few weeks.. and it gets old coming home and having to sleep on the couch
margin , then you have 48k and then you sell puts on shit immune to falling then you have free money. Or just buy this UPS FDX dip.
We think GME gonna dip again or fly today?
Strapped in 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Yes but my fiancée doesn’t know it
It will fly right into the tendie galaxy 🚀

b. Don’t follow its price In HK and acting surprised, which is really lame 😒
This, I'm alright with less humans until we fix some shit on this planet. Also, it's called Natural Selection and fighting it has left us with a crowded planet of dummies.

BABA coming down again
Sir this is a casino sere everyone gets a award
Goddamn it BABA...you had one job!
Why not snek?
Well yeah... they have covid...
I’ve been thinking the same thing and I’m surprised the price is as high as it is. Most people will just say no to the tracking unless Facebook presents a REALLY compelling reason why they should say yes. iOS users also tend to be wealthier than android users so if you lose that audience, advertisers are going to go too.

However....I’m hesitant to short because of the sheer tech power that Facebook has. During covid, they hired up a TON of engineers that were laid off or left shakier companies. Some of the smartest people I know work at Facebook and I see more people I know join all the time. That was their strategy during the last low period and they got a bunch of super smart engs that later built their mobile powerhouse. So, I wouldn’t be surprised if they have another solution coming out. This has likely been an ultra high priority project within the company since apple’s announcement.
I think I figured out the SNEK message... If you rearrange the letters, it spells out the acronym NKE which is the ticker symbol for Nike. And since shoes come in pairs, that's what the S is for... NKE(S).

They are acting like it’s nothing to worry about. This stimulus is not enough also. They really think people are just gonna go back to traveling immediately and everything all rosy and perfect.

Lord Cohen's previous similar tweet was on Dec 10 (Thursday), bought shares the following week, then a 13D on Monday. So since this new tweet is on thursday, does that mean he buys more next week, and a new 13D on Monday (just in time for GME's Jan 11 ICR)?

From my limited understanding and research the competition for processing awards scales with price, so RIOT would need to beat the competition to actually benefit from an increase in the underlying. They've proven so far to be unsuccessful at every price level so far, so I doubt they'll be any more effective in the future. Does anyone care? No it could keep running up on hype bit I'd assume it'll revert to its mean once things settle.

Same reason people play anything teetering on bankruptcy. With potential restructuring in the works and a online business savant as an activist investor. Bankruptcy was ‘priced in’ and if they can successfully convince large money that they have restructured and avoided BK successfully then there is huge upside. 

Downside is huge as well like with any BK play, if management convinces nobody of a turnaround and RC fails to take over/ decides to abandon ship then it’s over. Seeming less and less likely RC will abandon after his increase in stake and his tweet last night 

Just my thoughts, I would have begged you to get in this summer but I understand people being hesitant now after it’s seemingly risen so much. 

Just because I feel like writing the market cap numbers out I’m going to leave this here also: 
GME has a current market cap of just under 1.5B The previous floor BETWEEN console generations was 3B, during the initial year or so of both of the last console cycles the cap doubled (tripled for the ps2/Xbox) obviously Digital game sales will impact sales this generation but physical isn’t dead yet, most of the consoles made are physical disk versions. If we conservatively give GME a PEAK cap of the previous inter-generational floor at 3b the price of the stock will more than double to around 40.  

The short squeeze is a potential cherry on top, GME has the legs to go up without it

Pulling profits is when you have more than 1 position in the same thing. If you have 2 or 3 calls on ENPH and it goes up 100%, selling 1 to pull profit and mitigate losses would be smart because then you’re just betting with house money.
[removed]
[deleted]
Because it’s something that has occurred only once. There are a million eyeballs on GME, so I don’t think the shorts would be caught by surprise.

I’m also skeptical of the claimed short interest. It’s nothing scientific, but I think it’s hard to know who really is holding those positions and whether they would need to cover or if it is a hedged situation.

This would be an option play rather than shares for me because I do think the US probably won't go with this vaccine and that's where the highest margin vaccine sales probably are. I think the stock will go up as a bet on whether other countries buy the vaccine though in the short term, like it did today. Thanks for the post, it is interesting and I do hope for the sake of humanity their 1 dose vaccine passes and is effective.

Right now the bottleneck in vaccinations seems to be medical labor/ the logistics of giving a shot rather than production of the shot.

See comment by [Fun\_Moose1103](https://www.reddit.com/user/Fun_Moose1103/) below, pretty much sums it up. Unlike FSLY they don't have a single huge customer like ByteDance, so their customer base is diversified. They've launched more offerings lately like Cloudflare Access (now more mature), Warp (both Mobile and Desktop), and their Argo offering is also expanding.

A combo of Cloudflare Access, Argo Tunnel, and Warp is a great implementation of Google's BeyondCorp and closes the loop on all things access management.

Literally don't know what that means and Google didn't help.

Can someone tell me "bers r fuk" so I can go back to bed?

Edit: Snek awards? I use a version of Reddit that blocks seeing those meaningless awards from comments. Thanks but go waste your money on long dated $T calls.
have you ever heard of time? oh my god what are futures????? oh my god

&#x200B;

but fer real tho they just a special type of option
No, you should
Bc people keep hoping for a hostile takeover forcing a short squeeze.
For those of you who have a talent for buying the top and watching all your money disappear just buy PUTs

Yeah you’re a bear. Get used to it. You just suck at buying and holding. So do exactly what you have been losing on, don’t reverse all of it, just go gay and instead of buying calls or the stock, you accidentally bought puts.

All your shitty DD and fomo has always led you wrong and fucked your account down 95%. So keep doing that and only buy puts.

Puts are for you.

I support this.
No
I don't think I've ever seen 3 Ternion awards what the fuck
Tech is the hedge for everything lol.
i think of it as securities that can be traded AH that would usually follow the trend for MH. so if futures are down most likely will follow until market opens back up. you can see futures in "investing" the website
Do Boomers trim their pubes?
Do the snake reward stays with you forever? or its just a one off thing. I dont want a snake BTW.
Lmao, on paper. Until retards get greedy and lose everything a week later
No chit -- who has time for a girlfriend while trading 0DTEs with stimmy bucks??
Can i get snek pls

That has no bearing on the situation at hand because those in charge are simply directors, decision makers, and task delegators at the end of the day. Refer to corporate America’s chief executives list, same “abstract” qualifications
No you

Alright Mr. Snek - let's end the year with a green day.
Birthday in 3 days. How should I celebrate it while socially distancing
Is Snek team GME or team Melvin? I think it’s team GME
Might as well watch a soap opera.
G H I V or N P A?
yes obv, if theres not enough volume to fill the order

that's why low volume shit is bullshit

33 Gold
136 Silver

Thats like 750-800$ in Awards without including all the other random ass awards.

Im pretty fuckin sure this post is worth my portfolio in Reddit awards.

If you include all the comment awards its probably 3x my portfolio.

Agree with you on NET got in at 76.38 yesterday (all in). Q4 earnings plus the ridiculously huge reliance pretty much most major global firms have on this company is unrealised as yet.
Probably a stupid question....but is it possible to get a partial fill using a market order?

I'm soon gonna graduate from Computer Science and so hopefully I'll be in a similar situation as well. Then I can invest more into stonks haha. It'll feels so nice once I'll actually have large enough sums to buy out the dips.

What does a snek shape recovery look like?
Fuck, I knew it.
if you’re gunna buy pltr “for the long haul”, why not sell puts for the future so you can at least get a lower buy in price?

for example, selling a 30$ put @8 credit/share for say may would mean you’d get the shares at a price of 22$ rather than the current 25

“Seems like puts on GME to me” post was removed and user banned 

EVEN THE BOTS SAY GME🚀🚀🚀
I posted a similar comment recently but in not as much detail. I did say that this will have a negative impact on their revenue and earnings, and will ultimately affect their stock price. However, 2 things to consider here:

1) Right now, as I understand, it's only on iPhones (not all other devices). Apple will probably roll it out to other devices but that will take time IMHO. I heard somewhere that this will affect 5% of FB users.

2) FB is still part of FAANG. The market will give it the benefit of the doubt. And even when they present these bad earnings mid next year, my guess is the stock price decline will be small-**ish**. They are still a part of FAANG after all. It will take years for FB's stock price to fall significantly. This is going to make it hard to make an options bet on it.

FB poked the bear by going against Apple in a lawsuit. Apple retaliated by doing this (anyone who thinks this is about Apple caring about privacy is crazy). There is only one way a massive corporation loses **real** money and value, and that's by doing shit like this...not from any stunts (laws, bills) politicians put forth.
wsb retard giving DD: YOU NEVER SAY THANK YOU! 
ME: That's what the money is for!!!
Lmao some retard gave half of these comments platinum
Yes 1,400 awards is over 100.
If I was sitting on a big short of anything, I wouldn't buy to cover into a short squeeze, I'd buy call options and cancel that movement out.

Theta is tearing your right now and will get even worse as you get closer to DTE. If you only have a few calls then hold cause they are so cheap. But if we are talking hundreds of calls I would sell. Just my 2 cents
I don't think it would be enough to buy 27 calls
No, you
You’d get 3k off your 2020 income.  2k more losses can be deducted in the future.  Don’t assume anything about 2021
This shit bout to receive the most awards in reddit history
So if I comment here, I get an award?

This is nuts. 2k invested in a single post. 0% return. Definitely r/WSB material. LOSS PORN.
I got me some ARKG shares and I’m still bullish. The ‘genomic revolution’ has been ongoing for the last 10+ years - it’s just that companies are finally starting to translate the science to patients.

GME GANG how we feel bout this? Apparently fed ex has been refusing to take packages from GameStop for a while now. I read something that said fed ex has throttled the delivery’s for high volume customers which obviously 🚀🚀🚀 but idk if true I am retard. 

Browsing through posts on r/Gamestop its obvious upper management is absolute shit and universally hated (fuck you sherman) 

theres a lot of customers in the next gen console megathread complaining that they havent even gotten tracking numbers or anything for console bundles they ordered weeks ago. This is probably due to the shipping issues Fed Ex has presented BUT the eternal skeptic in me thinks theres an outside chance a company managed by total shitheads would sell consoles to customers that the store doesnt have yet. 

i dont know if anyone else has picked through that sub but theres probably a lot more useful information worth considering

Your investments are increasing. Thems gains, son!
LMAOOOO
No, you
They're almost the same thing, I just find it easier to remove the extra step for various reasons.

Also you tend to get a little more for a put than a call due to dividends, and puts imply more volatility than calls.
Some people have received it already.

Even ARKK and ARKG well over perform when compared to thse mutual funds. 

They even told me Tesla was way overvalued and that toyota and other car manufacturers will just kill tesla anyways...

This is the most awarded post on Reddit methinks
Ehat were your positions?
What’sssss with the sssssssssnake

Man wtf happened here
That being said, I’d be terrified to see what this country would look like if it was ran by primarily 30 something year olds...
Papa is that you?????
Platinum
Yea, retard.
Do y'all have a sell limit order and at what price? I was looking at the VW squeeze and saw that it happened so fast. I doubt many people will be able to catch it in time
So you think $750m tiny? Lol
I still remember that ULTA bear post. How it had all this real estate liability blah blah blah. made sense. who the fuck buys make up when they dont have anywhere to go. oh and all the stores were closed too.  drive last week in the rain and all the fat chicks were in line waiting to get in. smh
Do you know what sub this is? I can't even read what you just wrote.

It appears like metal gang is trying to tell us to buy Platinum...

Elon musk: “ The stock market is a strange thing. It's like having a manic depressive who's constantly telling you how much your company's worth. And sometimes they have a good day, and sometimes they have a bad day, but the company is basically the same.”

In recent interview
SPY could hit new ATHs by opening. They need to condition everyone to buy every dip some more, even minor ones before they unleash the big one and watch people rushing to buy dips in what they will later discover is a 69 layer dip.
Us retards went to the school of hard knocks... like Lebron James, Tracy McGrady...Kobe Bryant

They will have to when the economy starts coming out of this recession.  It is impossible for the Fed to buy back billions in debt, keep rates near zero, and achieve their inflation target in the long run.  Retard.

I’d agree with “up to 60” is optimal. I also agree that my folks are way more wise and knowledgeable about a ton of things, but the reverse is also true. My dads a phenomenal engineer, but can barely work an iPhone most of the time. Things change so much over a persons lifetime that I feel when you start to get to 60+, you’re so far behind and out of the loop of what is actually going on as far as emerging technologies, social movements, etc, that you can’t possibly be expected to make logical decisions.
Haha you guys should stop giving out awards and start buying pltr calls

And here I am thinking I'm super cool selling covered calls. Thanks for this, I've looked into it and Cash secured puts on ETFs are my next goal/focus.
Why sell them now when you can wait for them to expire worthless and lose 100%

No, you
Great tax shelter.   Work up to max.   Start w 100 then 150 then 300 then 400 etc every month.   Once u hit max of $500 a month u just set it and forget it.   Can always take contributions out penalty free if u needed but try not to touch it.  GL
That guy asking the question is not from here. If he was, he’d never ask that question as he would know our motto by now.

You are retarded.  You don't know what a bond is.  The coupon rate is fixed, the YTM varies with changes in interest rates and has no effect on the national debt after the initial treasury auction.  If you think the Fed will keep interest rates near zero in perpetuity you absolutely belong here.

People who are up 800% on tesla this year, are not going to dump tommorow. Especially not on the last day of 2020. Why be liable for taxes now when you can post pone it a year. Jan 4th will be the real blood bath. You need to roll those babies out

*Hey guys...I know making money in the market can be hard, but I'm here to give you some lessons from hard won experience. If you want to succeed, pick stocks that go up, and don't pick stocks that go down. I'll be signing posters at the door.*
Tesla gang! This is the Wayyy!
S&P -0.20%. Bullish.
10 days ago, futures dropped like 3% and recovered nearly all of it by the end of the trading session.

So, probably.
TO THE CORE
Citron tried to goof on NIO too. I was in at 19, got out at 49 pre earnings. And from then on, the strategy (100% success rate as of now) is to buy NIO sub 40, and sell out at around 46-49. Rinse and repeat until it breaks above 50 again. I think NIO was complying and was all set with the Chinese audit BS that went down too. Don’t quote me though.
The retardation in this thread is off the roof 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Is this the most awarded post of all time
It was merely a jest
Weak thesis weak rockets
Imagine begging on a wsb thread for a Reddit award
I am, retard
Whatever you think want to tell yourself

Li - shipping half of the cars as Nio in 2021

Xpeng - shipping half of the cars as Nio in 2021

BYD - shipped well over the 100,000 cars this year which was their first year and they ship buses and other vehicles too. Warren Buffett backed etc

But yeah no one will buy anything “off brand” lol
lmao. dropout and start "investing" as well. I mean real investing. Not buying diividend companies (what year are we in? 1950?).
fast track your way with growth companies as lower valuations it's the only way. My personal tactic has been to pump on the hype stuff and then the gainz on those I just invest it back into my hypergrowth portfolio of tesla and pltr when they dip.
It's +$55 in last 3 months.. in a wild bull market.
I'm a bot. Recent empty self posts, noob questions, and spam which people were temp-banned for. Bans are 1-2 days to discourage posts that ought to be comments.

This is probably the closest thing to a stimulus we’ll be receiving
Is this the most awarded post of all time?
Futures have been annoying this entire month
With enough shares, you could just sell weekly way OTM CC's on Tesla all day and make that your day job.
Would you guys sell your GE calls that expire 1/15/21 that are otm and down 40% on?
Can I get a award please? It will be my first internet points. :)

I'm sure I did cause I ended up buying PLTR
Started playing Lego Builder’s Journey with my kid and now I can’t put the game down. Wish they would IPO already so I could pour some money into it.
WSB would have owned GME by now if all the awards were used to buy GME.
someone told me i could get reddit gold for calling people retards here is this true
is it wealthsimple?
They had a year zero I’m pretty sure. Or did it go from 1 BCE to 1 CE?
God damn looks like I'm late to the awards show

Don't give me any awards fucking degenerates
Well said. Overall I think GME needs and injection of creativity. Their board members are old and out of touch, hence RC complaining about the average board term being 11 years!  

One ‘out there’ idea would be for GME to create a virtual marketplace for trading in (swapping) of digital second hand titles between members, who’d pay a monthly fee to participate, and be limited to a certain number of titles to swap. So you’d essentially rent the titles. Royalties paid to publishers might convince them to allow it and it would be a boom for smaller less well known games
The federal government isn't legalizing pot anytime soon. It doesn't mean this isn't a solid long term play.

Yup
I need to buy Reddit calls, when I see all of those awards
Because there was no Year Zero, the first decade of the common era (CE or AD) was years 1 to 10, the second decade was years 11 to 20, and the next decade will be years 2021 to 2030
Seriously, I think GME might be the quicker play now.

No

Platinum costs 1800 reddit coins, or just shy of $5

The recipient also receives 700 reddit coins. From the platinum itself. So assuming they spend it, that accounts for a little less than 2 bucks worth of additional awards
i thought normally theres a sell off on the last day of the year?
This guy literally bought the peak...you may be a little too late to the meme award party.
God I miss that it was great
bruh I wish I only at least got one award one day.... that's a lot of awards you got there... nice
I’ve scrolled so far and still can’t find a comment without an award

1.3 k awards. Lmfao this really is the sub for retards
Whoever’s giving out awards need to go to bed. It’s 2am
Everyone in that thread should be permabanned. That thread was fake and spammy like the comment section of coked out wanna be dj's youtube channel.
do we get reddit moons for awards?
How many times did we get green pre market only to end up red. This is a welcome change fools
Oh lol okay that makes way more sense
You think any of it matters? News is news, and it feeds the beast.
I love you
ah r/investing where morons still listen to the "anal yst"

It's raining awards on this thread... GME to the 🌕🌕🌕
The Krauts are taking the day off to eat schnitzel
yelp... my pltr 28$calls for tomorrow are they gonna print?
I'm late enough that I'll be the first comment without awards... That what I call buying at the top 🤡
So much platinum so little GME
qqq iv is 18.71%, qqqm is 24.12%(etrade), today's volume 18m vs 90k shares.  The only advantage for qqqm is slightly lower expense ratio, so you will benefit if you plan to hold shares for decades. Other than that, you will overpay for options and put yourself in a potential risk of liquidity trap when things get sour
Is there any reason for funds to run up the scoreboard to max out year-end bonuses?
This is the only place on Reddit where giving someone an award is a direct Fuck You. 

So Fuck You! All of you bitches!

That's very true about mutations but the point is people are ignorant and they don't give a crap about it which is kind of sad. I understand it must be difficult for them and I'm not in their shoes..   
I'll be brutal honest.. I don't know much about options.. I know basics on buying calls and stuff..I guess I bought lil long call because I lost some $ big amount this week..

I guess I shouldn't be emotional..

Where my award at wtf
squidwards father never hugged him
Ok fr tho whoever buying these awards, pls send me that award money instead so I can buy some GME shares? We can trigger the short squeeze together and I can move out of this shithole house with barely enough room for me to even walk around
Alternatively I'll take a reddit award myself and go back to tbe dumpster behind Wendy's
Wtf guys get those damn futures back up!
holy shit isnt this the most awarded post on reddit then

What post has the most awards on reddit? I’m pretty sure this one is the top but I’m at the level of curiosity where Its just high enough for me to type this comment and not high enough to put in any effort to actually research anything
21 days of pump left

Lmao wtf is handing plats out?
GameStop is trash 😭
GME Gang did it!
Good to take profits, don’t hold bags
The majority of the retail trading business is just investment banks providing a way for people to gamble on the markets and thus brokers and market makers will happily take the opposite side of people's trades. They do this mechanically just like a casino since the statistics are on their side. The cute version of this statistic is 90% of retail traders lose 90% of their deposit in 90 days.

If you prove yourself a winner then they stop betting against you and just feed your trades directly into the market.

In case you want to continue down this rabbit hole check out some Anton Kreil videos on YouTube. You'll quickly realize I'm just regurgitating the stuff he talks about in his videos. 🚀

Confirm 95% in non-trial humans, and report parabolic distribution numbers. Pump away
I'm still shocked there are seemingly reasonable gone calls for april at 2x my April strike
Let’s end the decade with a bang
People aren't going to sell their gainers the last trading day of the year and get hit with taxes due shortly after. If there are sales they will be in the new year. WTF
Everyday is 24hrs
We moved from burry to Cohen
From the low of the year to the high, SPY ran about 73% this year, the biggest run since the market hit the bottom of the 2008 crash in 2009. Ran 68% that year. 

I think that might be the record for SPY and for the Dow as well. Looking at the Dow back during the roaring 20s, none of those years swung as much.

What does this mean? I don't know, maybe the market will be a lot less exciting next year. Going to be hard to match this year's craziness.
Pshh a measly 500%?

That ain’t no squeeze.
That is LLC Twitter- Woke Twitter demonizes stuff like that as capitalist brainwashing
if wsb award is a stock I’d go all in
If Reddit was publicly traded, this would be a good time to invest. All the retards pumping money in.
This is it. eod = eom = eoy = end of decade, depending on convention

Rip d1. Goated game
A few hours and a whole lotta awards. Congrats you played yourself and won internet points in the process.
Wait, why does Ryan Cohen have only 3k followers on Twitter?
Wait— you guys are millionaires??
Wait what?
Can't, anybody shorting has positions to hedge. GME call holders are rekt
Gme gang for life. Or until we hit $60. Kakaw
Some things never change
This is so WSB
I'm banned from gamestop for stealing a Playstation 2 when I was 17 and selling it to an EB games. Apparently they had just bought out EB games and they shared databases. Bullish.
Yeah sorry bout that
Imagine if you could cash out the awards and YOLO them on GME calls

I also have 1/8 PLTR $30's I bought end of Nov at $6 about to drive me into the dirt.

That’s a lot of money in awards.

Am I evil?

Yes I am
I think we are just theta chopping for a bit in a consolidation period , before we go to the moon in the next couple weeks after volume pours in and fomo and momo trades are back . I would think now good time to buy Vega on your options
I hope it tests 211 again. I want a second chance. I wasn't ready the first time. 😞
Haha didn't even realize it had elevated to meme status. I am honored
I considered it. I think it’s a good play. But I’m more bullish in EV right now and would rather fill up my basket with TSLA, NIO, and LI.
Never forget
buy low sell high
I heard some kid sucked dick for Reddit Gold so I’m not surprised

Futures been flat for so long. Now SP is down .10% my god just go back to being flat I’ll take that instead please!
Does anybody have an estimate of how much money has been wasted on awards in this post? Smh

What the fuck lol
How many times can you pump on the same news? They already reported 95% efficacy. How can the news be better?
Based. Also REEEE because no tendies on the plate left. There is no way someone will give an award to a comment posted so late.
Edit1: thanks m'frens
I'm def using it for entertainment purposes.
Well, it’s the end of the year
I must have blocked so many gay bears lol. The only negative thing I'm seeing around here is people making comments like this yet I see no bears talking shit

I wonder if the gravity of your mistakes is actually starting to dawn on you. It’s like you hit big on the first lottery ticket you ever bought except you lost it washing your pants but you’re still in good spirits because you think you can just buy another lottery ticket and win without realizing just how lucky you were the first time.
i need to figure out the gun editor for BL3

I’m not saying American companies are clean but come on it’s gross. I am sure BABA and one of the Chinese EVs will boom but it’s far worse than I originally thought.

Can you borrow from your IRA? or is the money just locked up

If only you could exercise Reddit awards to get GME shares.
You can always instruct your broker to not lend out your shares. Just talk to them about it.
imagine people actually giving out awards to random strangers i really seen it all my god
I'm not a gay bear, but I do think this is what's going down short term. So i pulled $17k out to get back in and sell CC's on the way back up

If you want reverse psychology to work you need to go all in on the reverse psychology. Just like a YOLO, half assing it makes you less money.

Post should been convincing us to piss away all our money on Reddit awards so you could have all the GME shares to yourself. 

Pretend WSB is a 3 year old you're trying to convince to eat something new.
If you have documentation of it being reported and them not addressing it, you have some ground. Dig up all the records and information, and go in there like you’re holding 0DTE OTM calls. You’re at a point where you’ve got nothing else to lose, so given it to them (in the nicest possible way). Being angry and rude doesn’t help, reason with them, and have your responses / comebacks to potential ways they are going to shoot you down. 

If they still don’t want to do that, try different dealership and then start calling up the service / warranty chain.
No way it reaches 2000— Cathie will probably do stock splits

I mean like, imagine a janitor in 1932 mopping the floor and a black man comes by and uses the whites only water fountain.  He says, "hey, you can't do that."  Sighs, then disinfects the water fountain.  That's the extent of his racism, casual.  On the way home, he gets bit by a vampire.  Would he think blacks and whites using the same fountain is a travesty today or would he have acclimated to the modern world.

They don't think the "half dose" accounted for the 90% rate. Now they say waiting 12 weeks instead of 4 weeks between the shots did it? Okay. So even if that's the case, why waste giving a full dose if a half dose is just as good? And why would 12 weeks be better cause the other vaccines work fine giving them another shot within 4 weeks. They have no clue. They just throw their hands up and say it's up to the government to decide when and how much to inject. Keep in mind, the U.K. agencies don't review the data, they just take what the pharma companies tell them. That's why they approved the Pfizer vaccine a month earlier than us.

2k checks, if they happen (maybe 50/50) defo won’t be till after Jan 20.
Doesn’t sound like all that bad a system. I gotta fly a pretty complicated plane in a few hours and the weather is rough and getting worse so I keep refreshing wsb and my weather app.

Considering the amount of money people lose in weeklies I’m not surprised. Anyways, GME to the moon 🚀🚀🚀
Does anyone know if I will receive ARK dividends tomorrow?
When it shot up to 21 I got way overzealous and bought a couple 12/31s that have erased my gains for the month...
I’ve been scrolling for a minute and didn’t see a single comment without an award. You guys are seriously retarded.

There's no official ranking but I've found this post: [https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/f47rqh/the\_most\_awarded\_reddit\_posts\_oc/](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisbeautiful/comments/f47rqh/the_most_awarded_reddit_posts_oc/)
I am new to wsb. Buy me an award and I’ll join the GME train. Also, what does an award do? Can I sell it for cash?
Conclusion- Elon Musk
About the NIO EP9: [This video at 5:53](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbSB_J06fA8&ab_channel=2.3Mviews) Richard Hammond saying "It's like driving an octopus!"

(edit: "o" in about)
Well cathie bought it so probably
I sold, no way it doesn’t give me a cheaper entry sometime soon
It's a good stock.
nice argument
And it’s stonks btw dude!
Does everyone here get an award, not sure if this is retarded but clearly it's consistent

PLTR is going nowhere fast.  It’s a fine long term hold but the pump memes have passed it by.  GME is the meme play because it will almost certainly have a resolution in Q1

This made me realized I need to buy puts
I heard there’s some retards are giving out free awards here?
Fool me thrice, shame on you.
People saying GOEV need to chill. They're 96% hype right meow. Not even doing trial until 2022, and thats public knowledge. They're just good at marketing. Canoo will be a figment of our memories in 3 years. They won't make it though. 

Outside of papa Elons monster, WKHS, NIO, RIDE, HYLN, have products and contracts coming sooner.
*says the 75 day account
Absolute madness
Don't give me any awards. I only have 4 gme shares.
My reddit app just crashed, probably due to the incredible number of awards on this post 🤣

I love this! Super happy to be part of it 💎👐

They deserve it. That company had no place to IPO and did it just to milk Apple’s 2019 & 2020 hype. Source: friends work there - can confirm they suck at their jobs
What do you mean still with GME? He just increased his position by 1/3rd a week ago. He's over 10% now, so if he sells anything within 6 months he has to return the profits to the company (gamestop).

Lol imagine thinking the Fed will ever raise rates.
Its hard to believe that in this bull market people are not making money. I have family members that just monkey see and do in a stock groupchat and make thousands
may your portfolio rest in peace, we break 700 tomorrow
The guy on the other side of the trade must have some shares as a hedge against your calls. Those shares can't be lent for shorts. Don't let people who don't understand the mechanics of retail trading convince you that near the money calls don't help.
Oof
Im buying puts on that fuckin grill of his - It looks like his future stock chart
Anyone brave enough to do the match on how many shares we could’ve bought with all the Reddit gold?
You can tell a lot of people here have way too much in their positions seeing that they freak out over the smallest dips. Another Sept will put many here in the market for $ROPE.
Not since I had Taco Bell
Hi, but what's the point of having awards on reddit ?
Full retard, why?

You made it. You won. FIRE achieved.

Serious question. If there is such a thing on here, why do I want to buy into a failing company?
I am speechless my dude
This is fucking absurd. We could have fed a country with all these awards.

So if I bought calls, now I should sell puts?
I gave out like 100,000 coins worth of awards in the GME thread lmao. 

https://postimg.cc/McQX1f2h
Man shit is bonkers.
Lmao that is like the most awards I've ever seen on one post
I guess "filthy rich" and "financial freedom" are pretty subjective concepts
Yes you do. You want them to spit on you and call you a little slut don’t lie!
Can somebody please go through here and calculate how much money was spent on all these pointless awards, and how many Gamestops we could have bought with the proceeds.
[deleted]
lol yea i know seriously, stop posting this bs. this is the big boys club; 5 figure positions at the very minimum or dont post and clutter the subs.
Lol YOU don’t need shit. You literally just started working ffs. Grind down your student loans for 6 years while flying around the country for your idiot late-20s friends’ weddings and then come back and talk about how badly you need some extra money right around the holidays
FIRE EVERYTHING
LOL. Man they are better off putting into spy and arkk index funds. Atleast ark has 10% and 20% months. Thats a good amount
No way this still going? Lol
The month long dopamine crash that i've been on since PLTR dumped from $33 has me looking exactly like my man on the left

I was watching some mean reversion videos that were saying low cap was gonna start performing way better but who the fook knows
Now I’ll admit that I think 80 is too far gone. But 65-70 is acceptable. And 50-65 is optimal. Hopefully you acknowledge people who are your parents age are much smarter than you and have infinitely more wisdom than you, and therefore should be able to make decision about your life.

Haven’t seen you guys in a while, nice to hear you’re alive. Now go back to bed.
Gimme that GME!!
Wtf mate?
This dog is about to get leashed, let's gooooo
I heard because germany markets are closed today.
I thought you left?
TOS is reporting qqqm IV as 21% whereas QQQ is 26%. So slightly lower IV. And the reason behind the lower volume is that it’s a newer fund with less aum. But the volume has been picking up as inflow and aum increases.

And I did mention they have same holdings, did I not?
Anybody feel like today is an irrelevant day in the market... probably low volume flat day
Where you see the top awarded posts?
Got any more of those awards?

Edit: Thank you :)
So the S&P being down .01% means the futures are taking a shit? Man, I’m going to need to have a tighter stop loss...
We are both shaking with trading withdrawal
Futures are flatter than your wife’s tiddies
We did it reddit!
Wow some ppl really do make money on this sub!
This sub is brilliantly retarded 

I love it
There was a great meme with the Bill Gates impersonator some time ago.
PLTR $26c 1/15 for me. Not worried at all. Easily can be $30 by 1/8/21, and could be $22. But will NOT be $20, that’s for sure
Holy shit this has to be a record or something for most comments awarded

#I dint know EVs fly
its not so flat anymore
Na, gme is different. This is a once on a lifetime silver platter opportunity as long as you're intelligent about it and don't buy FDs
Was wondering the same thing.
There was a ~200,000 share wall today at $700. Not sure if that is still in as a limit sell, but might keep tesla flat up against $700 until those asks are burned through
Bulls are in shambles.
Yeah it’s almost time for a purge soon
With margin
weird, it ain't Easter but he baackkkk
Prpl or MT
No chance they’re asking to buy when they haven’t even tried to mooch off you yet
That's regulatory, not a Fidelity thing. But it's not per account, it's per account registration.
Dude you can’t sell puts if you have no money
No premarkets at markets insider ?
Seriously, reading stuff like that really fucks with your perception of things
I imagine reddit analysts have their most profitable subreddits ranked. As in, which subreddits are either driving the most awards or better yet, bringing in unique traffic to the site. I'm sure WSB is up there with the latter.
Sad to see the population forgot 6th grade science... mutations are more easily spread but less deadly because it wants to survive in the host soooo why are they saying it’s deadlier i hate this game I think you’re fine but like really how much of your cap is it lol
It’s too late you’ve already shown me the disgusting sub

If I was smart enough I would build a script that scrapes WSB daily thread that alerts me on spikes of mentioned tickers so I can ride the green dildo waves without having to read the thread all day.
Lmao where you been bro
Deadass Interactive Brokers is going to have a "glitch" where they accidentally don't margin call anyone short GME if it even gets close to squeeze territory. 

Might turn into naked shorts,  who knows what with all the glitches.

More realistically the SEC is going to volatility halt GME 3-4 times after some 10% spikes and it'll close red for the day.
Flat markets are fake and gay.
Interesting stuff
This makes me wonder what the most amount of awards a single post has.
You fucking autists. This is why we’re always broke.

Edit: stop this gay shit. A HUGS award? This is PHD levels of autism.
RemindMe! 1 year

I mean it is what is happening, just not quite as fast. These fucks had the share price at $3 and we are bouncing around 20 now
Gonna be a very flat day I think!
Bought those calls in recent dip and it’s red atm. Plus few youtubers are telling it will consolidate more and might go to $128ish and jump back but is it possible in 2weeks??

Flat futures are way better than big green dildos with my stocks tanking.
Only need options level 2 and have agreed to the spread agreement. Enroll in limited margin to make it easier since spreads are placed in type margin even if you don't have margin.
well this post aged like milk
Only 27??? 
Ok I’m a retard, I take it all back. We’re not onto anything, just collective retardism.
BUY THE STOCK you fucking award whores
CSP is like Call, but different, kinda same, but still kinda different, but still same.

I hope I clarified
Gimme an award and I'll buy 10 more shares at market open. I believe!
totally agree with you . thats why i got 5000 shares at the moment. sold 3000 yesterday for bhse though. if it gets reebok i think it is pretty big deal. i intend to sell bhse after the pump and buy more goev. GOEV is my life investment.

Will be throwing life savings into GME $32 16 APR calls thanks wsb🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
No. People will harvest losses. Hopefully you sold your dogs awhile ago. I imagine they'll take the capital from harvesting losses and buy into tech in particular.
Also, stop loss raiding
Fed will never raise rates
I love the night shift here

Cool it folks, the poors are onto us!
Sir this is a gambling forum, not a place for you to complain about being a incel.
Wow that’s never occurred to me as a thing
I heard earlier this year they were Canadian?  Chinese imvestors is not surprising in any company righy now with a biden lead America coming. Not concerning overall. 

Canoo is doing their soft launch in 2022. So if you like them, put any shares on bottom of portfolio till then.
LOL The "If they put a 100 mil and a book" one killed me. I would laugh so hard if the book just said "How to make a 100 Mil: You just take the money next time"
They can suck my dick. If they didn’t allow me to draw with crayons id switch to a more reputable platform like Robinhood
easy way: break out the wallet. 

more fulfilling way: become a badass to attract the asses
We will continue to go relatively straight up until the Fed raises interest rates in 2022, and there are other places to put money besides equities.  Bonds are absolutely useless as long as dividend stocks have higher yields.
There should never be lonely straight guys. There's gay guys out there more prettier than your crush.
Where did you get it from??
I think the amount of margin currently in use in the stock market is very concerning. 

What happens when margin is stretched to its limits? 

Rocket Ship down? 🚀📉
You just have to follow whatever OP says. It literally cannot go tits up
What if it doesnt pop? You'll just let it sit there?
Yep, spend the $1-5 to close out and be able to sleep on night of expiration lol
there will be plenty on here who try to and they will all get wiped out by the next headline about how Xi is making it his personal mission in life to fuck over Jack ma.
No , I’m not actually sure how this happened lol
Complaining about rules is one of the most fuckboi things one can do on this sub ya whiny bitch. We love market manipulation here.
Red flag:  AstraZeneca vaccine trials in the UK was only 62% effective. Since then, they found out >50% of cases in London are the new strain (from gene sequencing done in Sept though December). So, either they are the only one who can't make a vaccine right, or the strain accounts for the difference. Also, don't forget the 2k subgroup with the AZ trials where it was 90% effective. That subgroup had the original strain? They were supposed to be retesting the last month, but just approved it anyway..
I'm in a tank and your not.

You’ve got me dying bro.

I just found out there is a “no meme mode” as well. It’s all DD and YOLOs. We all follow Elon on Twitter. No need to repost his memes here.

You better LOTO too mf! Do we need to chat with HR? Don’t think I didn’t see that! 🤣
uhhhhhhh
If they measured it with the ballons, probably. But just for a comparison. When I visited gym years ago I was 110 kg and my friend was 110,1 kg,but he was like the ballon in the video. So it is hard to guess the correct weight for beer gut. Anyway, poor animals! I always fancied that those huge, long haired leg type of horse could only carrie me to battle XD
Put it in her butt!
Hell yeah man. I personally like them because you can actually go balls out on the track compared to some cars where using 100% of the power is just unrealistic. Sounds like you’ve got a good setup
With the right YOLO calls, you can turn that 6 hundo into...  


Well, probably zero  😂
Umm earnings is next month why don’t you just hold
but I profited 50 cuz I got a gift card so with my profits I can buy more stock
Yeah I've known Canada is going to get cucked so hard on this my entire life :( I used to stress about it in middle school knowing that Russia is going to eat our lunch but slowly I came to terms with it
what happened to these retards spouting equity and women power? bitch I wanna be dazzled.

2020 was so retarded 2021 almost has to be smarter. 

GME could hit 150, sure. That one mostly likely. 

Tesla to 7k is next... that shit would happen if they solved FSD. Lvl 5, lawmaker approved... TSLA goes intergalactic, cause then it's on line to be 100k+ a share in 2030. 

No idea about DOW and SPY, QS is likely to fail hard... though less likely than most of the EV nonsense that isnt TSLA or NIO, and I hope it doesn't. 

SPACs are dangerous, people are gonna lose a lot of money on them. If there are adults somewhere in the SEC they'll get regulated. But I doubt it, they'll all be making too much money.

The fuck are GMEs?
Could be free awards? I always get em and just randomly gift it to someone lol
Yeah I was thinking about that too. You think tech stocks will continue to have such massive growth in 10 years like they’ve had in the last decade and it’s not priced in / crazy evaluations rn ?
The ultimate gains goblin.
Fair enough. I’ve had about 5 of them. Still have my very first. Built block now on 30psi with a borg Warner

Oh no I don’t misinterpret anything. 
I read your post and clearly understood what you conveyed on 2 separate occasion that they didn’t have anything available new. You specifically stated  that they didn’t have the PS4 in stock as well. 


Now that you have included more information and edited, the story has changed, and unfortunately so has my # of brain cells. In order to preserve what I have, I’m cutting my losses and closing my position in this thread.

Omg Cohen is so hot right now -mugato
Me too brother. Me too
This is glorious! Even if it wasn't GME, this would be epic, but even more so because it is.
Kinda fucked up. People are dying and need it
GME/PLTR is dying cause we're too split. We can all srsly cause a short squeeze as early as tomorrow on GME if out PLTR gangs who put millions into it joined. Then we call take our winnings from GME and put it in PLTR. Everybody wins!
what do awards even do?

Probably? Mostly? Although a vaccine is going to put huge pressure on the virus to mutate, which is why we get a flu shot every year. 

I'm more worried about the 2nd vaccine dose. 103 fevers arent the safest thing ever anyway. Virus mutates, vaccine is less effective... side effects may also change. 

Whatever, buy the dip.

Is it too late for me to invest?

we need you to show your positions and another update, /u/vitocorlene

we shaking over here
Except in the USA you can't threaten to 'disappear' anyone.
I think you have misinterpreted what I wrote which is understandable, but I have edited the syntax and grammar, as well as some sentence structures in the above post.

My bad for typing it half asleep in the shower though.

They only had the PS4 in new, mint, finely
Wrapped.. what have you .. everything else though.. was used.
That is what that is? I thought it was a growth.
I thought it'd just be some software programmers.
All of ‘em, calls Jan and some LEAPS
My bad I meant $20.5
This a second Christmas
Tomorrow is going to be a chill theta gang kinda day.
i'm actually praying the vaccine don't work
Make that your new years resolution
Lol
Better post up tomorrow the results

What if it doesn’t correct?
 Can’t believe you went to target to buy a console .... all th3se GME memes and you go to fucking TARGET!
GME TO THE FUCKIN MOON RETARDS🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌙

Edit: Thank you for award Kind Autist
BAN THESE STUPID PEOPLE PLEASSE
Accurate on RKT
Yas GOEV is going to be the next big EV stock. Even Jay Leno said people will be banging in the Canoo.
Buying in at 2.5k upvotes and 1.1k awards my gut tells this is a good YOLO since r/wsb tards don’t have enough money to buy more GME shares but Reddit awards somehow
[deleted]
That sounds more realistic than a chiseled, handsome, fashionable guy creating TOS.
RIOT CALLS
I made it all the way down to the end of the post and am confused because title said to buy awards but post said to buy GME.
never seen so many fucking awards lol
The question is, will the drop be harder tomorrow than on the first trading day of 2021?
🤣RKT might be a stretch.

No

Can I get 2 awards ?
Could I cop an award?

you're on the right track, let the IV crush the autists
Have 42C 7/16. Twitter has a ton of upside. Good management in Jack Dorsey, lots of users with no sign of slowing down, tons of interaction around major events, they could even break into news/ streaming.
and of course as fing usual I have 1/8/21 calls
Every week?
honestly did not expect CRM to be the death of me
Appreciate it! Good enough for me :)
I thought this was a glitch. Damn y’all really do have Diamond hands. 🚀🚀🚀
Yep, like the milk left after eating a bowl of Cheerios
Considering that the overall sentiment of everyone's comments disagree with you.  You have a good chance since you're technically inversing WSB. Good luck!
Stonks only go up.
This is why your science teachers beat it into your heads to use units with your numbers, they mean nothing without units (or symbols) next to them. 2400 what? Shekels? Zimbabwean dollars?
If you see a hot stock, show us the way! Not for pump and dump, but rather to stop being poor!
Should have been running on descending red candle sticks
But you can pass STDs on Brest milk though, it should be tested first
Ber fuk!
Do you have a playlist you can share?
Give me an award and I up my position in GME
EXERCISE THEM
it's the IV crush and these autists still won't learn from their GME $30c earnings play a while back
According to your logic, AMD is Chinese company as well
Ridiculous 2021 predictions:
GME $85
AAPL $200
TSLA $400 (after second split)
NIO $120
PLTR $60
RKT $21
800 for 2hr. 6’2” redhead chick, fit. kinda broke now but so worth.

You guys can laugh all you want but this is EXACTLY how we look to the actual shitters on wallstreet
you remeber how in the 80-90s how parents starting preaching that every weird behavior is acceptable and to 'be yourself', well theyre growing up
Alright, it seems as though English is your second language, which is fine, because it is also mine as well.

With that said, however, you are contradicting your own post within the same post and with this comment.

You said that they didn’t have any new PS4s, but now are claiming that they only have new PS4 but not any PS5s. 

In case you are also not aware, consoles have never rolled out of factory on a daily basis to retailers in their early release months. The fact that we are in the middle of a pandemic doesn’t help the situation. 

As life cycle of consoles go on, a steady supply of current generation consoles will be available.

the memes write themselves
Tf is this. This could have pumped GME to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀
So found out that short positions needed to be closed today for this year's tax and longs need to be closed tomorrow to be considered. Since everyone only buys calls, yes tomorrow
If I was cool and had balls I’d invest all the money I had for this long term taint licking of an investment
I have never seen so much awards in my life, I’m blown
What do the awards even do? Don’t you guys have better things to spend your money on?
Reddit’s gonna issue the next meme stock IPO based off the projections from this post’s awards. This is the way.
Don't forget you got to apply for Margin on your account the same way. Oh and you can only have it on one account for some retarded fucking reason.

Boomer ass shit.
Spy puts by close depending on how it moves. Gonna assume caution moving into the first week of 2021 before stuff goes nuts again. Also, the people pumping game rn are just people who want something cheaper than PLTR lol
Okay what has even happened to this post
Well done.  Your country needs you. Run for Congress
You’re going to open to a -50% due to how Robinhood does their algorithms and you’re acting like a dipshit to people trying to help you

Are you Americans spending your stimulus checks on these awards???
Good luck....😱
I want one!

Edit: son of a bitch, didn't think that would work. Thanks gold and perhaps platinum? fairy!
It could hit 10 as well.
Chicken Salad.. on rye. Untoasted. With a side of potato salad, and a cup of tea!

You can get short term shit cheap as fuck. Not everyone is obese and diabetic needing a dozen scripts for 300/month.
Ok ok but two 120$ awards wtf
Thank you for the heads up. 

I’ll start digging. 

Don’t mind the retard downvoters. This is exactly how 2020 started. I found murmurs of COVID and started buying puts and anyone that mentioned it was downvoted out the ass.

If you find more details keep posting in the thread for the rest of us! Thank you!! 🙏🏾

Edit: I don’t think your hypothesis of new strains will be the main problem. 

I’m focusing more on vaccine lifeline and immunity. 

Either way just keep everyone posted
hold up
If it doesn’t work, bullish, cuz stonks will rise in hopes of new vaccine discovery 

If it works, bullish also

Either way, bears r fuk
This isn’t DD
But 
I admit , I’m typing incoherently and rambling mu sleepy thoughts while in the shower atm

Plats are $100. WSB guy is $100. Almost everything else is $5
Literally like 3 weeks ago... biggest regret of my life man
Out of all the awards, some limp dick gives one of the cheap free ones to me. Spread some cheese on this broke ass cracker.
Buy 10 shares tomorrow for each award for every post

Edit: Tomorrow
You didn’t buy enough
 This man gonna have Reddit Premium in his casket

2 to 6 weeks you will have results of vaccine efficacy on new strains. They can't hide it much longer now that it's in the news.
Can it be FAAGMANN and include NVDA and AMD plz?

Nio to $52+ yes
Saying PSTH is pre definitive agreement (DA) is wrong. Should be pre letter of intent (LOI). Huge difference. One is a binding legal contract. The other is eh we might merge with you but let’s check everything out first

Like your positions. Have a small position in BFT as well. Here’s to 🚀
What does platinum even do?

Unique set of customer data for a booming industry - it’s like blockbuster, but since blockbuster happened already, there might be a pivot. Or figure out a way to market that customer info they have to bigger players. That’s the only thing I can think to somehow justify any value. I got 100 meme shares to try and wheel on, see how it goes.
You don't know what you talking about, do you? They both have exactly the same underlying,  same performance, and iv is  identical. qqqm has significantly smaller volume, so if market sharply dives down, good luck selling your bags
I edited the post a little for more info. The store was was basically xb1 and PS4 oriented. No dedicated ps5 section bar from a small cut out from the PS4 games.

Mexico has cheaper labor than China?

Also, better margins than Telsa?  You actually are delusional.

That all being said, the stock may go up because this is a step in the right direction for Ford, but some of your points are absurd.

Not carrying a brand new PS4 is a great financial decision on their part. We have transitioned to PS5 in case you are not aware. 

What are the odds of someone wanting to buy a brand new PS4 when PS5 is out? You could’ve brought your own, but chose not to....peak autism and you belong here. You’re not actually a brand new 1st timer PS4 customer. If such a customer waited this long for PS4, they will not be willing to pay the price of the brand new one. 

Also, Sony loses money on consoles, so GME isn’t going to make any money of that. Instead they lose money by keeping it on hand for the off chance that someone is willing to come in to buy a brand new one after all these years. There is more risk to carrying that console and having it sit rather than waiting for an autist to show up to buy it brand new. 


Ever seen dealerships keep brand new older models? Yea...there is a reason why they get rid of them, used cars on the other hand...hey different story.
That's mike

2 weeks ago i was joking to my friends about the retards on reddit buying GME. And now look at me, I am one!
That’s good you think of those things but there’s tons of ways city dogs can get exercise and stimulation. Actually I feel like city dogs have it better because there’s tons of other dogs around them and there’s usually dog parks around.
  
A real concern though is not wanting to leave your dog at home all the time alone if you like being out. I work from home and still feel so bad leaving Remy.

I sold ccs for almost a full year on 1 stock. Never got called. Then it shot up quickly and I bought it back for like -200 because I realized 3 more weeks and it would have been long term gains vs short term.

Your comment is right on. Just ask any mid 30s working professional who has been working for 10 years if there isn't any inflation lol. Housing rental cost has increased over 50%, homeownership cost more than doubled since 2012 but yeah "inflation is under control". 

This will not end well.
I don’t know how you sleep at all lol

Everyone with a stake in GME is going to be dining on steak. Know the difference, it could change your life.
Crazy! What was that most awareded Reddit comment thread? Something about the retarded right? Jamie look that up...
Definitely priced in, China up yuge
I don't think it's his style. He's been advised by lawyers not to make any comments that may be used against him in a hostile takeover or in the event of a short squeeze. That's why he only uses emojies.

Nope positions or ban

I like to use TA to create debit spreads that pay. Take yesterday for example on SPY. It’s been forming a beautiful cup and handle, so I anticipated it going down. Bought some puts, and then sold some puts when the premium of the next lowest strike was greater than the premium of the puts I bought. I got paid to create a debit spread, so it doesn’t matter if it expires worthless or not
This is the hard-hitting content I’m here for

Leverage your body my guy. Maximize those orifices.

If you can’t afford to lose the money then don’t yolo it. Small gains is better than no gains, or worse; a loss.
Oh, oh wow...
WHO TF IS GIVING SO MANY PLATINUM AWARDS
I dont think itll pass personally but i do think this may win both run offs for the Democrats. The GOP angle makes no sense “taxpayer money is going to some wealthier taxpayers and if thats the case 600 is all you get ” like lmfao people are pissed. You’ll give people with 300k 600 but not 2k???? Poor people dont care who gets it they just want their money lol

Please read. I said every single time before and I'll say it again, *cars*. I said he said 500k *cars* in 2020, 1 million *cars* in 2021. 

And he said both. Tesla Q3 earnings call for the million cars next year. Right now, Fremont and Shanghai alone are each capable of 500k cars per year production. Texas will have the factory up and running next year, as will Berlin if they dont keep looking for reasons to slow construction. Its plenty reasonable.

I did assume a tweet instead of an interview, but that hardly matters to the substance of the statement. He predicted 500k car production in 2020 in 2014, I'm not gonna argue with his ability to predict production numbers. 

As for the Model Y, its estimated to sell 45k cars in Q4 alone, and has already delivered about 47k cars, so I repeat, MachE is at FAR too low a volume to compete. 

https://cleantechnica.com/2020/09/15/tesla-delivery-estimate-q3-2020-144000-q4-2020-187000/

Further, Model Ys are estimated to be 70 percent of all cars Tesla sells in the US and Elon predicted that in March. So of course he's ramping Model Y production - should be 500k next year; 250k from Shanghai and 250k from Fremont. This isn't counting the factories he's currently building. Texas will be finished next year. Berlin ought to be finished next year, if Germany doesnt continue trying to delay it. And its not like they're stopping building out Shanghai. 

https://thedriven.io/2020/10/22/tesla-posts-another-record-profit-readies-to-ramp-up-model-y-production/

If MachE wants to even begin to match sales with Tesla, it needs to produce at volume. It appears to have no plans to do so. It's a nice gesture, but they don't appear to be committed to it.
I guess if you read delivery delays as bad, or as " we are selling so fucking many people don't care when they get it. Orders don't stop."

you are planning for something that happened 3 months ago and hope there is still gas in the tank. excluding tesla this sub has more been about large scale pump and dumps were most people pull the trigger after the majority of gains have already occured.

Luckily this is all just bear fantasy. Ber r fuk.
You know the word...
I’m really not. I don’t give a fuck if she has Covid I wanna eat her fucking pussy, man :(
I think other FANGMAN like $Nvda, $FB $NFLX and $MSFT will hit new highs next week...so I’m buying the dip. Meaning I will buy weekly OTM calls and complain why I’m not profiting
I guess WSB will be at the top. Instead of stonks it will be for more autistic headline reasons 

Fuck it I’m in I’m spending all my covid tendies on plat awards
SQ has calls expiring 12/31 is there gonna be a dump?
I like the one where shes at home and you can see all the personal stuff on her shelf and get to know her better ❤️
Epstein's Island cost him \~7m, which means there's autists here that could band together for an island. We could start a gofundme and then declare our own country for tax purposes.
What 'actual pump and dump stocks' are those?
Look like a lot of people from WSB gonna connect with XRP army at mcdonalds but worth it 🚀🚀

All the real traders out there wouldn't tell us any of their goddamn secrets. They're just scrolling laughing at us flop around like fish out of water or like an obese turtle, turned upside down, baking in the sun, as it were.

What are the chances it goes thru?

for WSB to be great again there needs to be a great cataclysm that wipes out the PLTR and GME gangs portfolios

For some reason I don't think of it as "theta gang." It's just "you want to give me 30% of the value of the stock in 3 months to offer to hold it for you at today's price? Uh, sure."

I don't even have to guess if it will go up, I just need it to not crash and I get paid.

It's also the only way I can think of that you get to cash in on a stock that has already mooned. I get paid more to sell a 3 month put on PLTR than my first shares cost a couple months ago.
Could I get one as well :)
I thought I was trippin when every item I had on the counter was met with “sir we don’t stock this “..or “ do you want to buy it used, we dont have this new”

Me: then why do you have it on the shelf?!?
Na they arent all that expensive. Most are a lot cheaper. Reddit plat and gold is probably most of the cost. There is a bot that pegged the total cost at 1k a little bit ago, I saw after I commented above

Still a crazy amount of money for reddit awards, but when you make 3 million in a year on gme, you can afford to go a little wild!
Life changing?
Don't forget the Kool-aid
Have you never seen The Office?
They’re in the WSB history books forever for shaping the culture with their great sacrifices. They’ve done the deed and moved on.
Right now all I'm doing is "If it's a SPAC mark it as spam if it's under 500mm".

I've got a hoverboard to sell you too, like the one from Back to The Future. LMK if you want in!
I've never seen so many awards
Dude, you still have another $1.59. Just nail 7 10-baggers in a row and you'll be a wealthy man.

ZM, DASH
awards are for losers 🤮
Same (recently at least haha). I had calls when that bug 40% pump day happened. Sold at peak. 

I’m holding calls now again. Hoping it hits $25 by feb.
That was me last night, I was holding an uncomfortable amount of GME buying dips
You'd be stupid not to go all in
GameStop owns EA Games. Which is the Australian version (same company). 

But you trade for the gains.

What the fuck am I looking at.  This dude spent like 40k on 0 day PUTS.  Holy shit, youre a moron.
Pre covid I’d go out to a nice restaurant around 6-7 and chill at the bar having dinner and a couple drinks then pass out by 10-11. Midnight was late for me lol. Love it.

Fuck off Melvin! GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Pros of sitting down to pee:

- no splashback, pee doesn't get on the toilet seat *or* your pants/shoes

- back against the wall so you're not at risk of being attacked from surprise predators

- no need to turn on the light in the middle of the night so you can aim

- can check your phone/browse reddit if needed

Cons: 

- none
My eyes are hurting from all the big caps. Sorry you all got gang raped. Maybe you should talk to someone about that.
Can someone tell how much the total of all these awards are somehow?

I’ll buy 1 share for every award I get!

People cashing out their GME tendies for platinum rewards instead of lambo's lmao.
Let the boy watch!  I mean, I’ll be watching for gains.
am i too boomer or are you too boomer
If Cathie Wood made an OnlyFans it would eclipse the AUM of the ARK Funds by a significant margin.
I hope you’re patient enough for maximum crispness
Some lad made a stop motion video which was on the front page.  There are similar quantity of awards given to this post and that. The difference is.... well you all know
Doubt it, at that point they'll just drop it on D+ with the premier access like they did with Mulan and be prepared for whatever losses they're willing to book.
Username checks out🤡Nice try Melvin. GME  🚀🚀🚀

Just because of covid. Otherwise I would be out at a restaurant bar having dinner and a couple of drinks then going home to pass out.
This girl told me she can’t come over bc she has Corona and doesn’t want to get me sick. Boo-Hoo lying bitch just say you don’t wanna fuck me, acting like she cares about my health the fuck outta here
People want to work for Google because they respect work life balance and Amazon has a very cut throat, toxic and grinding culture.   

They have invested in some amazing moon shot projects, but you need to take into account that they had invested in a fuck ton of these and only a fraction of them turn out successful, also j remember reading an article last year that Google is going to stop investing in any new moonshot projects.

The reason their stock growth is slower compared to the rest of tech is because of Cloud business, most the growth in Amazon and Microsoft stock prices is because they dominate the cloud business. And Apple has been moving up recently because they've started to pivot into a services company from a hardware company, what this means is that they can have the P/E ratio of a software company now (25 to 60), it used to be less than 10 for Apple from what I remember.
Count post awards which are about $5 a pop with a couple $100 awards. Add all comments which almost all have awards at $5 and some at $100
There is around $450 million worth of contracts expiring in 2021 that the US government has with Palantir..I have a feeling not only will they get renewed but for longer years and more $$$🚀🚀🚀
Drop the f nasty if you want a ban

Edit

Now we're talking!!
Yeah June was a huge bait. I think CCL is safe this time with positive news flow coming up and 0 WSB retard attention (I am biased because I made a lot of money off it).
There’s legit less than 10 comments without an awards

CALLS
Growth and owning a share of the business. If some super smart dudes are making a ton of money, why would I want them to give me the profits instead of continuing to make more money with them?

At *some* point they will plateau and be making mad cash with limited growth opportunity, then it makes sense to return profits to investors. Think oil majors, big banks, etc. Big banks today were smaller banks 40 years ago and were focused more on growth.
AAPL 💯
Why not give Melvin more $ROPE and let SI increase to 420.69%?

Not exactly sure how much cash collateral you need, but I figured it’s easier/cheaper to hold a long dated option and use that as collateral and sell weeklies against it. Big fan of poor man’s covered calls.

once the ore production catches back up prices will continue to drop as mills come online and production catches back up with demand. the price spike is tempprary.  when it will drop is questionable but it seems to take 6 months to a year.

Bless you for your explanation but usually when someone says this, they are being sarcastic.
What in the hell is going on here?? This has to be a record for awards in a single post
Another interesting thing to consider? (1) In just one day 15% of existing shorts have been closed (2) executives are dumping their shares as a charitable donation -> they therefore don't have to pay a capital gains tax

How are they gonna report unaudited earnings for the quarter on January 1st. Are you sure you’re not thinking about deliveries maybe?
Fuck it, I'm all in. Was bagholding PLTR but I think this will pop sooner.
I just posted about this earlier today. I have almost everything into buying and renovating a rental I’m working on atm. Feel so broke. Will be better once I do a cash out refinance but then I’ll probably put it back into another place lol

Why? To moderate what you say to yourself from your alt?
Cant believe we are getting $600 dollars on our robinhood accounts after 9 months of global pandemic. This is what we get from paying taxes from everything you eat, you buy, and you earn. What a fucking government we have who doesn’t give a fuck.

yeah like what below says, you have a bunch of stocks, but do you have 100 shares of a ticker? Because that's how you do covered calls. Ana analogy in the real world would be your 100 shares = a house you bought, and selling covered calls is like your tenants helping you pay your mortgage weeky/bi-weekly/monthly depend on how far of an expiration date you choose

THE END OF THE THIRD REICH DRAWS NEAR
Look at all of that money that could have been used to help the GME cause....  


Who am I kidding GME is going to fucking Andromeda and there's no one that can stop us!!!🚀🚀🚀🚀 🚀🚀
That moment when you realize that the market cap already went up by billions. The wizards of the market knew about it and priced it in.
Oi you fuckin wot m8
Stick some awards up my ass please! 🚀🚀🚀
Right till midnight. Drunk YOLO
Hahahahahahahaha hahaha you wouldn't exist without us pussy.
#WORST ATTEMPT FOR A FLAIR ^
A platinum award hasn’t been given in 9 minutes.

That’s a record for this post
Wow
why not both
Would if I could
There’s no turning back
Agreeeed
Youre welcome. But I bet you anything you won't hold long enough. And I say that not to trigger you. Follow the principle that the money is in the holding. 

Also, now that you've got me on my high-horse, the SPAC structure does not prevent the company from SUCKING. So it needs to be a quality acquisition not some NKLA shit.
Only up 900% in the last 15 days😂. Not gonna lie, only thing I'm pissed about is that I didn't dump more in initially
Better buy some within the next week, it’s only going up
Secret help please
754 awards at 1:51am

Haha okay we all had a good laugh - please buy the GME shares... I did.
lookin rather lost beltalowda
Dude don’t be stingy hook us up with that link son
OP secretly a gay bear trying to get us to spend money on awards rather than GME shares. Don’t fall for his trap boys. Short squeeze would’ve happened already if all y’all retards had spent your money on shares already instead of awards...

Edit: What did I say about awards you retard
...964 awards later

I hope you win, coming from a Tesla shareholder. If you don’t take this as a learning experience and move on. God has his ways maybe you win maybe you lose time will tell god bless you
that’s my stimulus yolo
Good man! I know you're joking about the personal loan, but since its WSB I have to discourage that anyways just in case!  GME is just about as sure of a win as you can get in the stock market...but its still a stock and has risk!

That said, I've gone pretty deep margin on gme so maybe I shouldn't talk haha
Only if there’s more than two other chicks jacking you off. Otherwise no.
Not if it’s gay

 Why why why why would you put 30k or even 5k into gamestop as an Australian? Most of the traders on here are driven by nostalgia for days gone by but like c'mon is there any credible info for why GME will not just crash again?

Every board of all 500 companies are working against you. Plus the Federal Reserve of the USA.
I can help you out with that if you stimulate my testicles
Yeah, I didn't realize the leaps would be hard to get rid of. My pltr leap call spreads can be up 20% but I can't sell them because nobody's buying or the bid/ask is too wide. I feel like I'm stuck holding these till expiry which is fine but it's not what I expected. The worst part is the value tanks to zero every time the trading day starts or finished so if this had been a large position I would just get margin called bc robinhood is retarded
Nice
No. You just buy the LEAP and then sell the weeklies. Poor mans covered. Or as I call it, the pimp hand strategy. Because if the short leg runs against you, it gets slapped down by the long leg. Otherwise you just pimp it out until it’s not pretty anymore and you gotta dump it in the lake.
So 7 seconds?

10 to 150 is 140 in gains. But that assumes you sold everything. “Closing the position realizes the gains or losses.” If you are up or down and didn’t close the position don’t count it. Also dividends are taxed too.

Lol.
Can't wait for Covid to disappear when the clock strikes midnight tomorrow
If someone gives me platinum (fuck the brands) I’ll invest all into GME
what do you mean? its 50/50, you win or you lose
Good point. Something to also consider, Sherman came on April of last year. Lots of changes and store closures since to reduce morale. Nonetheless, I’ve been following r/gamestop as of recent and the shit the execs have pulled over the Xmas holidays (during covid) is just sad.
This depends. Contact your cpa to be sure. But if this is done on your individual brokerage account then yes 90K tax on profit, but if its done on 401k or roth ira then u can chill and worry about when you are 59 1/2. I am not a financial advisor.

its basically a total of shares traded. Some level 2 waits until the end of the day. Sometimes they show a bulk order on level 2 that is several orders clumped together and then shown as one order during the trading day. All depends on the broker.
Yep, profits were realized and I’ve been liquid cash for some days.

F is no way near TSLA. Even the CEO of F came out and praises TSLA gigafactory technology saying they are at least 5 years ahead compared to VW and they themselves have no plans for opening their own. He can always buy back in after collecting premium and the capital gains from F. That is IF F ever goes up

Figure out how to make money. 

First step is, ask yourself, what is money?
Literally cracked up at this
can i get platinum. out of coins, want to award so many here.
The culdesac is hard af. Fitting, for a suit wearing penis.
Only if you have realized the profits. If you just have that much value in stocks you hold you don't get taxed until you sell, and then on the profits of what you sell. Keep an eye on long term capital gains as well and you could save yourself a ton.
But actually... self driving car software.
Give me a 1200% play 🙏🏻

GME is a rich gang, proud to be in it
my full portfolio and strategy are in my blog www.beatingbuffett.blog.    up 120% this year and 66% annualized returns past 5 years
I got asked if its a sub for financial advice or economics or something like that.   I said no.
Tonight is 2021!! Bullish all year!! 😎🤑💚🚀🌕
His tweet makes me think he's taking this "personally."  He's watching what everyone is saying about the company and probably wants to show them up. He knows most of these analysts think GME is garbage but still buys 10% and then goes to buy 13% of the shares. RC won't back out of GME because it's his pride on the line. I firmly believe he will take control of the board and change what's necessary for it to be successful.

TL:DR 🚀
What the fuck happened in here?! 🤯
whats fupa
It's part of a larger contract I believe. Flip over to the "By Month" chart and you'll see there's nothing for Jan 2021+.

You couldn’t be more wrong about that statement. Genomics is a very vague description of a very competitive and diverse set of industry sectors. And no, the gene editing space that you’re referring to is not “moat-y” at all and Crispr (esp the cas9 that CRSP uses in its clinical pipelines) technology is open sourced—not private IP. It’s simply a first mover race at this point, absolutely not a moat at all. EDIT, NTLA, BLUE, BEAM, and a host of others are in the gene editing game with CRISP, they simply are slightly the furthest along with current clinical stage of pharma trials. Piece of advice, don’t fall for the trap of thinking you know more than you do, it might not hurt you now when even a Turkey flies in a hurricane, but when the markets normalize you will get fucked.

Tracking some spammers here, I kept seeing some retarded GILD buyout rumor for the past few weeks. 

Don't know about that, but if it doesn't come soon 200,000+ Jan 15 calls are about to be worth less than a tic-tac.
Find one with a famous sponsor. I'm not even shitting you. It needs to be well-marketed. Chamath and Ackman are on CNBC all the time promoting the shit out of their SPACs. It matters.

DD - minimal because you won't know what the SPAC buys. If you do know what it's bought do as much DD as you'd like, but I'd focus on macro-trends and which way the innovative and monetary currents are flowing. Follow the money.
Over 2 years, I lose paycheck to paycheck.
Correct. I failed to mention that I roll on Wednesdays when there’s a dip or if there’s statutory holidays, which is 8-9 days instead of 7.
You can buy them off the rack like that at Abercrombie & Bitch

Time and fucken time again. Short covering? Stock price going up doesn't mean short covering if SHORT INTEREST IS TRENDING HIGHER. These clowns are talking out of their asses. They're trading at 50% of all time high? Market cap wise? Nope. Its like saying Apple is worth less than Amazon because Apple is trading at 130$ while Amazon at over 2k$. 

GME outstanding share count dropped from their all time high of 150M to 69M now. Market cap wise they're 15% of their all time high. Fucken these dumbasses boomers. I'm going to buy more GME.

Let’s compare to database. For traditional ‘structural data’, you need data base. It’s like you are looking for MS excel or MS SQL which can be downloaded easily and can be used by non engineer users(with some knowledge). But big companies which have huge data often use Oracle which needs engineer to deploy and customers need education how to use. Oracle takes some hours to install and it also takes several days, weeks or months to implement for the customized data base. The customer also needs DBA and developers in house. I don’t know exactly about Palantir but from my research, their product is like ‘data base+OS’ for mega huge ‘unstructured’ data. And I somewhat agree with you that Palantir is a consulting company for now. But I just want to say that you don’t always need to have B to C software for big growth. I hope Palantir’s Foundry will become like Oracle in the big data industry in the future.

So I agree with you and I've*suggested* this to people I know . Buy GE now for your long term portfolio lol. Fyi I work at ge although not renewables but I'm aware of what they do and what's being worked on. Your DD is as spot on as it could be. After Biden takes over I think this will spike up a bit.

Also ge renewables are getting bunch of contracts in other countries (other countries are way ahead of america on this front). Aviation is the bread and butter now and for obvious reasons I can't say what I'm working on but there's some cool things coming up in the future. Healthcare will always be good. 

In short I think GE is on a great comeback. Our new ceo is pretty damn good. Too bad corona with a combination of the 737 max plane slowed us down a lot. But if you have patience this is good investment

I bought it 7 months ago, 2017 911 turbo miami blue. It’s no doubt amazing to drive, but after a while I can’t believe I’m saying this, it gets boring. Also, like 4 seconds in and you’re breaking over speeding law in the country and you always constantly worry about how people drive around you, etc. It handles insane, but tbh I’d buy a cayman or something not as fast to be able to enjoy it more (also probably buy the manual instead of the PDK)

GME THE WAY
This gets my PP so hard
All these idiots here who think ARCT is like ARKG cuz it sort of looks and sounds the same.
Not if the investors agree to keep the cash in the entity and make a SPAC out of it
This is hilarious. 10/10 buying GME shares tomorrow morning.
Y'all a bunch of retards.
That's a joke now.
It could keep being a hopeful stonk until someone big decides to actually play with it due to the low entry price. People panic buying and selling then become scared, leaving it flat for months.
Yes, I do have some but this “warming up” time is taking as long as a SPAC so something could happen

I would award you if I could afford it. All in already. 2100 GME shares checking in.
AAPL and TSM has always bailed me from shit Yolo”s.
Tesla is cyberpunk levels of hype times a million. The narrative has gotten to far ahead of reality and the backlash will tank stock. Elon’s awesome, I own a TSLA roof. Stock is a complete hyper bubble and will follow same pattern as recent bubble.

You buy them back to close out the contract.  You buy back a contract to close it because either 1. You think the contract is gonna go up alot or 2.  The contract is worthless, you made your money, and wanna close it out.  

For example, i sell contract for 1 dollar.  It's friday and its worth 1 penny.  I can't make any more money, so why sell it any longer and have it potentially go up more.  So i buy it back for 1 penny.  

Or im selling Tesla calls and its up 100% this week and wont stop going up.  I don't wanna lose anymore money so i buy my contract back to close it out.
Do they think musk is a doctor or an economist lmao where they asking him this, oh wait they only care about using his name in the click bait

Show me the award
Me too. It’s great
This is true, but 28% is exceptionally low. Compare that to Bed Bath and Beyonds CEO who has a 58%.  That is also why I looked more into reviews from employees who worked for corporate and not just  B and M stores.

As it should. Bagholders are only people pumping it now hoping to get rid at a minimum loss

Rule #1 about WSB: if you see a ticker being spammed, you are too late. Never fall for the retarded spam around here
My guess is the 2k stimmy never got priced in because everyone knew it wouldn’t happen so it really shouldn’t do much to the market.

But the market does whatever insane shit wants anyway. 

Probably dip real bad and shake a bunch of people out and then close at 31000 in the last 15 minutes.
Brother just told me he uses his phone in the shower. Wtf
What makes you bearish on Tesla?
Stick to the traditional covered call strategy with 100 stocks. If you can't afford the price underlying*100, then play another ticker. No point risking for margin call

Holy Hell! THat's the most awards I've ever seen!
Maybe they'll sell soon, puts!
I love how even the traders mentioned we are at 50% of ATH... For share price. Market cap is 25ish% of ATH... This shows why you do your own DD. $50 minimum, $75 more reasonable... Imo
BP is garbage.  Upside will take forever and not be that high.  Give me a highly leveraged oil company that spent the pandemic hovering near bankruptcy.  I made 100% gains on OXY this year.  Sexy stuff.

Yeah I mentioned this before but didn't touch too much on it. There is a big difference when it comes to the approach that they are going for here. Fed/companies will fully back FDA approved pharma but don't give a shit about backing for legalizing for public use like weed.

Big balls. How much are you down currently?
Cathy and Burry are bulls. They have best in the world cloud and machine learning expertise. They more diverse than apple: youtube, search, ads, cloud,     chrome, android, Google pay.
Agree, that’s why the bulk of positions won’t expire until later this year. Inclusion will definitely put the brakes on a move to a certain extent, however a market correction is likely in 2021, and if you reference early September for example TSLA would likely sell off harder relative to index. 

If I’m being honest though it’s an ego trade, and the thesis is that we will see a somewhat similar event as was bitchcoin moving from 2017-2018. Narrative bubbles tend to have an initial nuking of 30-50 percent, followed by the slow bleed as sip buyers constantly get smacked. 

That’s the thesis at least.

There's no mention of grid decentralization, which is a huge trend now. $PGE is moving towards localized battery storage because of wildfire risk and that's just the tip of the iceberg.

AMC market cap is less ($350M) is less than most SPAC's bring to the table ($500M) and there's an average of 3 SPAC's a day since Nov. So is it that far fetched to think hostile takeover just for the real estate is in the cards?
🤮
What's the points of assuming you're about to become a millionaire if you don't spend money like a millionaire? I for one want to act like I've been there.
Here to remind everyone to be careful comparing this to cannabis stocks, expecting a huge bubble followed by a big crash. This is FDA approved pharmaceuticals, completely different ballgame.
What if youre a multi millionaire
Its not the $ but the %. With enough equity you can make $800 off a 0.001% move in stock. This trade costs me only 200 to enter, so I can buy a lot of them.

If you make 800 off of a 2k initial investment, thats like if I buy 10 of these and get paid 8k. (I have 5 right now but plan on adding during any dips in the near future)
I want yours daddy, give it to me

They'll probably say at Nio day that they are expanding to other countries. Someone posted to Nio subreddit that they are looking workers to Norway.

PLTR is love.  
GME is life.
Honestly....both those scenarios are fantastic for us. If they made bank in March and exited their positions, that would mean that the consistent short interest isn’t from one player with very deep pockets but likely many players with less deep pockets. OR they didn’t get out of the position in March and they are dealing with an annoying fucking position and want to unwind as quickly as possible so they don’t have to deal with this shit.

ORRRRRR as you say....it’s so “insignificant” that they just flippantly close it all in an hour because LA TI DA we are high fucking class and don’t care about money. 

Either they made money and exited 6-9 months ago, they are still in it and are not having fun, or they are in it but don’t care about the losses since it’s a small position.

In all of those scenarios that’s good for longs.
hmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm
No.
2021 is gonna be awesome because it starts on a Friday.  cant disprove that.
I love you dad
Three weeks ago when PLTR won the $44m contract with the FDA, the stock went up 21%, so by my calculation we will see a 12-13% bump tomorrow 🚀🚀

Exactly. I got into a spat with someone from r/investing yesterday because he recommended VT and VTI for a beginner investor who wasn't planning to pull out for 10 years, with 2000 bucks as a starter fund. Bro, YOLO that shit on something more interesting. Or at least ICLN or the ARK funds. Get some real gains, not that weak 7% per year if you are lucky. You are young, you can afford the YOLO, take more risks.
At least it has a LTM P/E, which is one of the qualifications.

It was cold in the morning, with dusty air blanketing everything as far as Sana'a could see from her position on the rooftop in Karachi. She stood up and stretched, and it felt good after a night of sleeping on the mattress on the hard ground. She looked down, and Fatima was still fast asleep. She rubbed her eyes, and decided to get cracking on the morning chai. She started brushing her teeth, and sleepily opened the newspaper. Her eyes widened, and the brush fell out of her mouth, as she leapt to her feet. With trembling hands, she reread the headline to make sure she wasn't dreaming, and then let loose a whoop that echoed off the empty walls. At long last, Allah had answered her prayers. Her decision to major in gender had been finally vindicated. 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Inverse me
NKLA still has $6B in market cap with $900M cash ($2.40/share) against an est. $1.5B-$2.0B ($4-$5/share) in class actions claims against it. If AB announces it is pulling out of its deal for 800 hydrogen-fueled trucks - NKLA’s last remaining order - NKLA will fall to <$5/share.
If your getting $130k a year you just put in half the 400k in bonds and half in index fund and rebalance every six months. 

Save 10-20k a year in a savings account for emergencies.

Of course you can play options or whatever with some if you want, but if you don't want to ever think about it, that's what you do.

I feel dumb asking this, Bully me if you have must. but does the GME stuff not violate the market manipulation rule for this subreddit? I’m asking since I’m new to this community.
They had to rescind some of it when they sent checks to dead people the first go around. I’m sure they didn’t get the majority of that money back. Probably will happen again this time

Couple other tickers that are catching bids as a result as well. Though I do think this has real cannabis 2.0 potential and could run up to some truly retarded levels on hype alone.
Should be up to about 50k in TSLA puts by the middle of January. Wouldn’t mind scaling in up to 800. 450p from June onward should print. March is a lot riskier.

Bro this is not the place. If you REALLY came into that type of "hypothetical" money, get a financial advisor now! Learn as much as you can and whatever you do, don't start spending $200k/yr because you suddenly get $130k. Get a house, travel, indulge and enjoy life, but keep your senses and don't over do it. And for you own sake, don't tell people you have this kind of money in real life. Obviously they will notice you have money, but you don't need to tell how much. Oh, and avoid developing a drinking problem/coke addiction/ etc. or your money will be either be gone or you will be dead. Enjoy, you lucky bastard. (And if you wanna invest in real estate with me hmu lol)

I do one play at a time in each account I have. I was just selling AAPL calls from both accounts ~$210k in shares. Selling weeklies 9 days out opening up positions on Fridays for the extra theta. Sometimes closing positions on big red days and reopening up for 11-13 days out. 

I just got assigned last week after using my AAPL shares for 4 weeks straight after the run up.

I just entered AMD a couple days ago it was at 1 month lows (900 shares @ 89) and sold Jan 8th 90C. My other account is cash right now waiting for a dip. 

I only usually play one stock at a time, sometimes two.

I can definitely see this printing. Tomorrow being the last day of the year, shorters should be coming out the woodworks once this gets even closer to $700. All while short term swingers dump all they have before the new year!

Good luck.

Bag holder confirmed.
Michael "hold my bags" burry doesn't need to.
I was watching it since $13 and thought it would pull back. Then by the time I had freed up some money I fomo into it at $18 lol. Averaged down a little already. I’d probably wait and see if you can grab it under $17. Seems to have really good support around $17.50. I think this might get close to $30 before merger. Afterwards who knows with spacs.
Night night fellow retards
IPO C which gets voted on conversion next week (plan on dumping), SRA C which will be sometime "early 2021" which I may hang onto some shares after it merges (Momentus), and STI C which is BarkBox.  SRA C I'm selling CCs against in the meantime and will do same for STI C if/when they become available to offset any swings before I sell.
Im deep in shares right now like 85% of my portfolio but no options should I just grab April 25-30$ strikes now or wait for them to dip or like is it too late fuck idc im buying them tomorrow @ open
I dunno but I can see it in my bank.
The idiot though we were at half of ATH price. He isn't even aware the float has been massively reduced from previous years. ATH valuation was 5.8B, were not even a quarter of the way there.

That’s what she said
You are talking about $15 on a weekly if you are within 20 cents of the trading price.  More like $5 if you are 50 cents away from the trading price.  It's an $9 stock with low volatility so the premium on 100 shares is going to be terrible.  If you end up ITM during a dividend (which hasn't been paid in a while) you will end up paying back that $15.

Sell at open, but at close. Typically you lose no time value from close -> open, but you have the possibility of gap up or gap down. The day is normally chop. Not to say stocks can’t move a lot during the day or do nothing after hours, but typically that’s the case.

Hey I have been accumulating NOK for a few months  average cost about $3.60. stock has done fuck all, so I thought hey I can theta gang and sell some options. Nope options market on this thing is fucking dead and retarded at the same time. So holding this shit I've been doing more research on this and Nokia isn't really that great at these 5G towers. They fucked up something and had to backtrack a couple of years ago and are playing catch up. There are better 5G plays out there but maybe not as cheap as Nokia. Just don't expect this stock to really go anywhere.

 Most exciting thing to happen to them is a few weeks ago they sold rights to the Nokia brand to be used on a whole bunch of random products like TVs and Toasters in india, no joke look it up. Soon you'll be able to buy a Nokia dildo to fuck yourself with for some excitement, cause you won't be getting action from this stock.

I gave that guy one of those awards and he sent me a very angry message telling me to stop fucking around and buy GME. I've always wondered if he did that for every award.
A lot of these things are qualitative and hard to value. I knew some of these (though not others so thanks) but my point remains. Based on current fundamentals, it's woefully overpriced. Sure, fundamentals might improve but my point is they would have to in order for this price to be worth paying. Clearly that's the bet you're making.
This is different than true, underpriced securities where fundamentals would have to severely suffer before they were bad investments. GME used to have that margin of safety at $4; plenty of upside and not a lot of downside. Now it has a lot of growth expectation built in.

Did you actually read the prospectus? I’m guessing no by your arrogant ignorance.

The redemption price is the pool of money divided by the number of shares, NOT $10 as a flat rate. You don’t think the SPAC leadership is paying themselves? You don’t think there’s overhead? Research costs? Legal fees?

The money gets spent. If you ask for a refund, you get what’s left.

No they’ll do some lame boomer shit that will conserve your wealth and provide modest gains over a long time period.
22? Nah. 30!
Solid advice their.
TSLA hasn't been invincible in the past, although now its in the S&P500 could be a different story, it just tends to fuck you when you least expect it. This 4.3% run up on no news looks pretty technical in nature. Im guessing some sort of rebalancing flows and loss harvesting of short positions year end which has been amplified through large call OI at 700. There were massive dark pool prints as well yesterday and someone bought a large amount of 12/31 650c likely with the intention of riding up a squeeze. There's still been sustained OTM call buying through to jan 15th expiries however put OI at 600 has also significantly increased since 25th December. Shorting with stock doesnt seem so bad right now on a risk/reward basis.

No open secret that TSLA position as the 7th biggest company in the US is hardly justifiable but don't hold your hopes on this thing crashing by itself. Even though it looks like this run up is very similar in nature to september (no fundamental change + massive  call buying), TSLA only dumped 25% alongside nasdaq vomiting up 7.7%. Bleeding sideways looks more likely than a straight up dump especially without SPY crashing.

So basically like the rest of the market?
I understand that more complicated than it is worth part. I have been having a hard time figuring out how to draw data or keep track of all my positions, but I am slowly figuring it out. 

I am not sure how much money you have in your account ( don't tell me) but you should probably dedicate a portion of capital to that AAPL trade, like start with 10k or whatever and then see if you can do it with that, while keeping capital back to make other plays. 

Earnings season is coming up. So that is usually a good time to get a decent little chunk of change.
Their multiple direct offerings have been cucking call holders repeatedly so far, so I’m in shares and short puts. 

That said, the price always runs back up to break new ATHs and it seems like they’ve raised enough cash to hold off on another direct offering for awhile, so I think leaps are good too.

Nio doesn’t have “over 104 competitors”. They have like 3-4 and that’s including existing major automotive manufacturers. Nobody is buying off-brand shit if they can afford an EV. They’re buying the name brands, Nio or Tesla, or a new EV offering from GM, Nissan, Toyota, etc.

If JD could just move like BIDU once.........
I agree, my calls were dated 1/15 and lost so much. Granted they were far OTM to begin with but... idk. Also PFE is most popular on RH rn ???? Also holding calls for 2/5 bc of ER on 2/2. I just had to sell my 1/15 to reposition, I think I’m willing to hold until ER though, I have faith they will go up.

Tape prints like these aren't a single after hours trade in the way they *appear* to most on the tape/time & sales. They carry what's called .W flag - which is a mix of Weighted Average Price/Special Pricing Formula Transactions and "Bunched" Reporting (among other things) from the earlier in the day - reported from a broker/MM/trading house.

They show up on almost all stocks/etfs at the end of the day, right after the close.  They stand out like this on the highly active stonks because of the huge single averaging print.

More info here (and Section 403 above this one):

When people find self-value. There's a reason why cuck culture is rampant right now. There's too many guys out there who have been told their no good, and society doesn't give af about them. Say what you want, but life is tough when you are constantly bombarded by negative experiences. I am fairly certain that many of those who suffer from incel tendencies have more than their fair share of awful social experiences, so they just see themselves in a negative light. It's actually very heartbreaking and sad to see.
It is?
Lol

Interesting. I saw them used often out on the floor and in the ICU of a large academic medical center I just rotated at. In the ICU especially. Obviously this was an extremely high resource setting and they still seemed useful. The hospital also owned some butterfly devices attached to tablets for provider use down in the ED.

I appreciate the feedback. I do enjoy FD's occasionally, but I use the Kelly Criterion with my own subjective parameters to size them. See that big jump from 1.2 to 1.6 in September? Mostly a Zoom earnings FD. That big drop? Partially a failed FD on JD.   

As of last week I am following Dumb Money's Discord channel. Their "social arbitrage" approach to fundamentals really seems like something special. But besides that nothing other than shitposting (perhaps a bit more intelligently compared to here) on Stocktwits.
i'm getting mine tattooed on my neck
You’re also not considering that the average law student graduates with like $150k in debt. The $180k starting salaries are at Biglaw firms, and most people don’t stay there long term because constantly working 70 hr weeks isn’t that enjoyable. Of course first-year associates at Biglaw firms are highly compensated; they’re all sitting on mountains of student debt and they’re putting in long work hours. Their salaries revert back to the mean when they leave.

A pre anticipatory run would give you a chance to maybe sell to recoup your initial investment and ride the free contracts to tendie town.

Some solid, useful information that is.. and shoutout for hypothecation. Hell of a word.. Also, on the subject of hell the upvotes for this are on 666. I can't change 666 or 69 or 420 etc. For obvious autistic reasons, otherwise I'd upvote.

I’m gonna _guess_ that at a given ask price there are probably _not_ over 3 million shares available... so that means the next highest ask gets bought up... and that continues until the order is filled... soooo the price goes _up_ ...

I wip it out every week. It won’t get sucked otherwise.
You accidently tagged this as a meme.This is top teir dd.
No deadline. Buy whenever you can. Hopefully, it will be at/close to a dip.
New covid is bullish. We ripped for 6 months on old covid and no vaccine. Covid is the best thing that's ever happened to the markets.

That doesn’t matter since you’re not buying them back. If the stock skyrockets then you’ll miss out on profits that you could have made holding the shares but I don’t dwell on that. Onto the next trade!

Okay so GME's data on gamers alone is worth a ton. Plus a digital revamp of their online platform allowing gamers to buy games to pick up in store or even sometimes have Same-Day delivery in select markets is very bullish for their sales. They're also testing esports and retro-gaming centered store experiences. That and the fact that they have a revenue sharing deal with MSFT to earn off digital purchases from each sale of an Xbox console for the lifetime of the console. Also, MSFT is helping with the revamp of their online experience and adding tablets and such for experiences at the store. All stores will have Microsoft Office and Teams to be able to better communicate with each other about stock, etc. Oh and the Chewy founder, Ryan(our savior) Cohen is investing along with Michael Burry and other smaller activist hedge funds, etc. Cohen wants to make GameStop the Amazon of gaming like he did with Chewy.

No a retarded chimp is super OP even by Chad standards. Chad accepts that retarded chimps are approx 35% more powerful than he is and does the cool thing by being totally cool and buying the retarded chimp a beer and being his friend until he can get in with the chimp's GF and take her out for a nice latte before porking her down and saying "all's fair bro. Let's go find you a new girl. Stacy obviously wasnt right for you, you're better than she is." And then finds a nice hot Becky and pawns off her average friend on retard chimp and then they high five the next morning, building up chimp's self esteem.

Bought a few 115 calls 2/19/21 a month ago and I’m up 187 percent. I truly believe it will reach 170 by Feb.
Flat futures? Meme stocks +10%
i bought a few shares today too
Historic options data is apparently hard to come by so I can’t really back test it well, but I think there may be a point where it gets more complicated than it’s worth. I’m a room temp IQ smooth brain that has thoroughly enjoyed clearing 1-2%/week in options premiums with an easy out if shit looks like it’s going south again. I’ve looked in to some of the more complex options strategies but for now I can’t understand them well enough to see how they’d be better than collecting premiums between buys and sells of solid blue-chip stocks. 


For reference, my 2021 strategy for now is going to be exclusively “wheel” AAPL to see if I can outperform buying and holding. Closed out my PLTR and other meme stock plays today to end the year on a green note.
I would 100% exercise and hold - signed a bagholder

I feel you. I live in a state where if you get a medical marijuana card, you forfeit your right to own a gun.

Good luck, but I’m wondering if January is when most profit taking occurs.  Personally I’m waiting until then to unload some TSLA shares to put the taxes into 2021.

Not saying that 1 million shares is going to move the needle, but if someone is buying consistently and decent amount of shares every day for about 1-2 months (from why I’ve seen), there must be a certain level of conviction that it’s going to go up in the mid/long term...or at least a catalyst that has yet to be realized in the short term. 

We’ll see...I like what I read from Takeda’s reports and feel that have a strong outlook in the coming years

100% $28-30 range. Kinda varies it seems on how many times it tests. Citron it was rocketing $30+ until the tweet. I believe last time it tested $28.50 like 3-4 times? Didn’t break out and crashed to what were at now.

u/ComputerTE1996 where is the next DD ?
Last time he tweeted he bought more shares to get to 9,001,000 total shares.

RC accumulating to 9,001,000,000 shares incoming.
That's fuckin neat
Futes say bears in shambles.
Its a once cancels other, you can set a stop loss and a profit taking target at the same time. If either one is hit it will cancel out the other order. I have just been getting into them as well. I am not sure exactly how to apply them yet, just that they exist. I was trying to come up with like a trailing stop for my profit taking part, while maintaining a hard stop loss, but like I said I am not sure how to apply them until I get more data on them.
Did not lol, im just scared of decay. Just keep holding till next week?

Totally agree with that too. Customer Service is Chewy’s core competency, the pandemic was a blessing for them because it accelerated their customer acquisition curve, and based on the behavior of their existing customers there’s no reason to think people are going to be like ‘oh thank god we can go to petsmart again, fuck chewy’ after it’s all over. People like chewy, their customer retention is excellent.

Doesn’t make sense why they’d issue additional shares to raise capital if they were planning to be bought out. Also unlikely since they recently changed their board structure to staggered elections.

Go look at how much that company is STILL growing quarter over quarter, every quarter. No it hasn’t run it’s course. I’m sure it’ll climb more in 2021 although it did just jump from typically chilling in the 60s to now the 90s, so it might plateau for a little bit. I’m not expecting short term action but am holding long
Youre comparing shitty turtlebeach headsets and roccat peripherals with corsair that makes everything from peripherals to pc parts thats in pretty much in every pc build. Goodluck retard

Correcting - check the price target(s).  Buy in once it consolidates.  I don't buy the "iT's a PanDeMic sTocK" talk because once you get the box at your door you have little incentive to get in a car, deal with shitty drivers, get in a store, deal with shitty people, etc.  It's here for good.

No. If it goes against you and you’re full marginned, that’s a stop out. Usually 70% of the margin is the stopout. If you don’t wanna get stopped out you can deposit more money but that usually ends in you losing way more money because it keeps running away

Also many advertisers are talking about focusing on more traditional marketing efforts as well like PR, etc. There’s no doubt that digital advertising is going to be impacted across the board, including Google and other channels. It has already been declining for a while now with constant changes like this. 

But I think FB will take the brunt of it by losing the smaller fish that make up a huge portion of their ad revenue
Mitch is the type of guy who would give you an award but deducted from your stimmy check.  Then tax you because you got coins.

GOOG is misunderstood. People think it's dominantly an ad-revenue business, which is reasonable because that's the biggest revenue contribution. But it's quickly becoming an "AI" company. 

Take a seat back and light a cigar, and close your eyes. Call centers and help desks all around the world will be run by an [AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D5VN56jQMWM&ab_channel=JeffreyGrubb) that sounds like a pleasant American woman unlike your Indian counterpart, and the best part is you won't know it's an AI. Think about Google's AI implications in [health care](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/11/30/deepmind-solves-protein-folding-grand-challenge-with-alphafold-ai.html) . Waymo is considered the runner up behind TSLA in AI driving. 

I truly think Google is the leader by far in AI, and we all know AI is the future. Google is the real Skynet.
I’m sorry it just seems too retarded. Like of all stocks? 🤣 hopefully your autism pays off

I should add to this --- absolutely nothing wrong with leasing. Even though I was teasing the custom plates are a flex against leasers. Leasing is smart and can make sense under the right circumstances, especially if you have an umbrella LLC.

Margin account doesn’t always allow naked options selling. And main point of this type of stuff is low risk profit, where naked options have much higher risk. If I short covered calls and the underlying moons, my only pain is missing out on potentially more profit but I still come out with profit. If the same thing happens with shorting naked calls, I’ve now lost a substantial amount of money.
Yea but did you YOLO on Hertz like a dumbass and lose 11k back in May 2020 when the pandemic was soaring and killing people by the thousands because you use to work at Enterprise rent a car and thought maybe this is a great time for travel

Yes, my expensive life lesson will print eventually. Invest in gold.
Biden will not remove steel tariffs. We are in a massive deficit and the last thing he is going to do is remove billions of dollars of income to help offset all the stimulus.  The stock had nowhere to go but up, much like all the others. 

Tariffs aren’t driving steel prices at all and haven’t been. 

We haven’t seen a supply v demand scenario like this since 2008. 

The 2018 price action was artificial as everyone was trying to get steel into the US before the tariff went into place. 

I remember it fondly (being sarcastic). 

We had 30,000T of steel coming in from Turkey and the boat was slow. It was supposed to make 4 stops - Philly, Miami, New Orleans and Houston. Once it hit Miami, we knew it wouldn’t make it in enough time and unloaded it all to beat the deadline before the 25% hit. That was the last time tariffs drove prices. 

Since then prices have been driven on supply v demand and the cost of raw materials. 

COVID wrecked the entire supply chain. 

That’s where we are now at and it’s going to get worse before it gets better.  

Good luck though!
if this pans out....it'll make up for the entire year of my TSLA loses

I'd predict that in the long run you'll basically end up in the same place but here are a few differences:

1. Check the delta of your call. It's a number between 0 and 1 for calls and it corresponds to the derivative of the option price with respect to underlying price. In layman's terms for every $1 the price goes up, the option will go up by the delta amount of dollars (multiplied by 100 because that's how many shares are in the contract). At the time I'm posting this the delta is 0.85 which means you can expect the swings in the price to act more like 85 shares than 60 (so, more volatile). With options the farther ITM you are the closer the delta will be to 1, so eventually your LEAP will behave like 100 shares rather than 60. If the price drops the option will resemble fewer and fewer shares. So this is a benefit of buying the LEAP over shares.
2. Your option will decay in value just because the potential for growth is lower (it has fewer opportunities to moon the closer to expiration you get). With an option that's 2 years out it won't be that noticeable but with a 15c at $15.20 and the price at about $25 that means there's about $5 of time value in the option that will slowly disappear over two years.
3. If PLTR starts paying a dividend you won't get it with the LEAP but given the current meta it probably won't pay a dividend by 2023. Theoretically this is also priced into the option although it's such a small thing that it doesn't really matter
4. The farther ITM you go the harder it will be to sell the LEAP at a fair price because deep ITM calls with a long time to expiration are barely traded. PLTR shares won't have that problem.
5. With a LEAP you can sell poor man covered calls, but with shares you'll need a full lot of 100 to sell calls against. The option will be cheaper for that

All in all I think the LEAP is a better option although there's a few advantages to shares (no value lost if the stock crabs for an extended period of time + more liquidity + small chance of divvies)

Well for one, Google and others haven’t announced the removal of the 28 day attribution window like Facebook has.. so the performance metrics will look much better for their ads. I’m sure they’ll do it eventually, but I think they’re deciding to hold off for as long as possible and convert advertisers to their platform.

Regarding the opt in, it’s for apps and FB relies much more on its app to collect data and send location pings than Google does for Chrome. Plus people are more likely to opt in for chrome if it makes their browsing experience better or opt in for Google maps, Gmail, etc. Googles apps are useful for people while FB asking for permission to collect data leaves a bad taste in people’s mouths.

But even if Googles apps have the same opt-out rate (which they won’t), Google has a lot more reliable first-party info on audiences without their apps. They have Google Searches with high intent and FB has social media activity which may or may not mean anything at all when it comes to the users actual interests. People like a million posts a day and are part of groups that they totally forget about.

2021 is expected to be hugely green
Bro you are looking at pure technicals and not the fundamentals.

Let me simp it out for you, ya smooth-brained milksop:

- Vaccine. Means we’re going to build up immunity to 🌈 vid19. Means people going back to work
- remember how covid affected businesses and they shut down? Well guess what, that shutdown also happened with iron ore mining, and blast furnaces.
- MT has been getting rid of bad debt for years and sold all US ops to CLF. MT is the largest global producer of steel. When was the last time you were told the “largest” anything was bad? 
- There will be a period of shortage on steel. Steel buyers buy 6mo out. Steel buyers buying now. Gonna be record buying right now, so they can get the shit they need to build more.
- if this doesn’t make sense, I suggest you read some of u/vitocorleone amazing DD on this subject. If you refuse to believe it, well, let’s just say MT is an offer he won’t let you refuse.

Very simple, it’s a supply and demand, and will only happen for a short time. Also, tariffs don’t just “go away,” under a new president. It’s not just the tariffs, it’s the price of mining, iron ore, coupled with short supply and increased demand. I suggest you read up on this topic and quit being such a cockalorum about the whole thing.

their dip was over Thursday and Monday, Monday was flat here

Whenever someone talks about volatility forecasting, it's almost always going to be a GARCH model. If it's not, they're probably overcomplicating it.

Here's some good introductory reading if you have some background in statistics and linear algebra:

Quite a few youtube videos on the topic as well.
I bought yesterday.

Some stocks worked out. Sq up 10. Dis up 5 crwd up 5
23/hr puts you middle class. You can barely live off it
Plate should be LAZR and you should install autonomous sensors in it
A good 5 maybe 6 a week. I’m not into swing trading I like to get in and out as news could hit and completely destroy my account. Sometimes, recently anyhow, I don’t trade forex much because of the overly volatile market. Like it moves 1000 points in a second on some days. So it all depends, in regular times I’d be doing maybe 5 a week
This video is so cringworthy, I had to watch it with the volume off. That said, WSB autists do not get enough credit for their sense of self-awareness.
Sir, this is a Wendy's
Can you fucking retards stop tweeting at him about WSB
Did he go to the moon?
I love how someone responded to Ryan Cohen tweet with the capybaras curling meme video.

How old are you
Yer fuckin fine if you took 1, no matter what the strength lol
Huge buy of gme after hours
All my past spreads have been closed early a day or two before expiration when theta has done most of its work. Out of a max 10k profit I close early for about a 9-9.5k overall gain (so that I can get a head start on the next spread)
Yes I understand how it works. I just don't get the appeal in a margin account, like most people seem to have. 

I understand this strategy in an IRA but not the margin accounts, when you can just sell naked calls or credit spreads.
He says as he's fucking his cousin.
That’s retarded
Because the price went down a little today. So basically if  the price goes up or the price doesn't move, his options lose some money every day because it becomes harder to reach the break even price in the remaining days. If the price goes down, reaching 14.45 becomes more likely, which makes the options more valuable. But at the end (on expiration day), the price has to be below 14.45 or the option owner loses money.
he evensays buyer beware he already exited
california/new york custom plates cost more than your poor state, and you can't get them if you lease, so in a weird way it's a flex
buyer beware lol what a cunt

The S&P 505 just wasn’t as snappy
Take a look at $SPY - big run up that didn't recover until Q3
You don’t, but it’s fun to watch I guess
It’s price is just too nice to me I do bet I can get 100% off it
ya mclareners tend to be leasers and they roast them... then 2nd gen mclareners get fucked. never see rari or lambo lease deals like mclaren
It’s pretty sad how you expect people to not insult you back when you try to talk shit, this is real life you fucking spud. Get a life. That’s typical retard behavior. You are the one who called me a monkey in the first place so shut your Kyle average douche bag White boy Ohio ass up. You’re just scared that the minorities are gonna some how take over. That’s what all you stupid ass Neck beards think. Hopefully you say that shit on the street so someone can knock some sense into. Sorry that your family is full of inbreed incest porn binging neck bearded righty whitey truck driving hill billy assholes lol

I enjoy Cohen's style of tweeting.  Really subtle, gets everyone excited, and instills confidence in retail investors (at least) when it's most needed.

With a single emoji he expresses his feelings on the whole situation.

On that note, buying more shares tomorrow.
Here is some love I recently acquired from a bored millionaire on WSB.
Game over
Sounds about right, assuming I don’t sell in the morning, but God knows I won’t be doing that
Why not buy MARA dip?
Ugh... lol. Jan 13 holiday report coming. Smart......

The S&P *500* is made up of *five hundred and five*  companies.  This is fucking horse shit.

Not just WSB, even analysts are bullish.🚀🚀🚀

Arkf since corona shifted a lot of payments and transactions towards this, looks like it introduced it into a bigger platform to grow
Its still valued basically for bankruptcy. With the moves they've already made, fair value is between 2 and 3x. This is a fortune 500 company with 6 billion in revenue. Thats higher than airbnb and doordash combined. Many things are overvalued right now, but gamestop isn't one of them

They're involved in esports as well, so more than just hardware...but thats an early phase project atm
You’re and idiot
Then why did you bring it up? Huh? Huh? Why'd you do that, huh?
So how do I play this?
Mclaren got Bad build quality, search up their owner forum. They have the worst reliability
Mitch is in bed with gyna!!!! Literally wtf
3rd was really good too. 4th was ok..not great

why would Kathie buy shares of the company doing the buyout?

Wouldn't Roche have to pay the premium for GILD driving Roche down?
Interviewers expression is gold😂.A meme star was born.
How many trades you make daily or weekly?
They are basically the same store
What if WFH never goes away, and companies allow people to work from home so they can save money on leasing or maintaining property
whats a CSP?
You can't spell trader without retard.
Yep, I just saw it too
Frtfce1
poor people say this, and i get it. but a generic plate on a high end exotic is what is gay my poor friend
What. The. Fuck.
fun fact: GME used to pay a 12% dividend and noone wanted to buy it then
Mods
I was born with a shitting penis
Thanks will add it to watch list, I bought Sbux at 78 and sold it 90.
The ability to partner with Bill Ackman in the SPAC process is worth the limited downside. I put some on margin just to stay in the play. Conviction 💪
He looks like a mountain oyster kinda guy to me. 

So which company is it now that you know?
what happened in Jan 2018 fam
The Indians and Chinese have resumed the moon mission
Of course MMs will do fuckery. but i think that will be only after the release of the delivery and guidance. it could be sell the news with 500k delivery beat. it can melt up if a surprise is waiting like 1 mil delivery in 2021.
Because in Canada the McMansions are owned by the Chinese?

130 x $5 spreads = $65000 collateral.
Holy fuck, SPY is actually red at midnight. 

I think this is the first time this has happened in weeks.
Do NOT do that. If she’s actually into you, have her stay with a friend she has. No friends? Well, red flag, but it happens. If she still wants to come, offer to pay half of her hotel for a weekend -  not ten days ffs. She pays the first night and you pay the second night. If you guys hit it off, she can come back a second time and stay with you after she has earned it. She not cool with that? Then she’s using you for money

There are plenty of chicks in your city that are better than this
our boys like oprah up in here

How do I buy calls on reddit?
Yea that's what scares me about opening new position. I had Sbux @ 78 and sold it at 90 scared of getting back in.
Youre in a prison work camp.

Your number is drawn for the gas chambers.

The prison guard offers you one last chance to masturbate and throws down two png files on the floor, one of mommy ethot wojak and the other of tradwife wojak.

Which one do you jerk off to?
Same. 🍿for the next 3-4 years, at least.
Hes the 1%
I sold:
9 Calls (Control over 900 shares)
Expiry January 8th (1/8)
Strike Price $90

That yielded me $2300 plus if I get assigned I’ll make another ~$900 because I bought the shares ar $89/share and they will be sold for $90/share. 

Essentially making $3200 for holding 900 shares of AMD for 11 days.
Theoretically, if we knew what bill spacman ate for lunch everyday, we would know which company the deals with
Your whole point is it will go down when it’s announced. You could buy otm puts for end of q1 and make money if you truly believe that. Instead You’re just a gigantic pussy who doesn’t even believe in his own advice.
This is easily one of the top comments I have seen here
Put it all in NIO
There should be coins falling from his pocket while he's following  the bill
Where did u/ComputerTE1996 go?? I need his DD
I just can't get into Mclarens... they're fast...they look good. But, just can't beat a classic rari or lambo. Also what should my custom plate be?
Me too, but it do be flat in Hong Kong

I like the at&t lady 😏
