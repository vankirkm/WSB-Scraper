Well I set up an IB account but I kinda didn't like their platform plus they don't give you that much day trade leverage so I don't trade with them all that much.  Just this account primarily.  I trade big for the account size when it was a 40k account but I have more money than what is in this account.  Now that I have 110k in this account and say I lose 10k it's tempting to just trade huge to try to get it back but often times you prolly aren't on your game in the first place and you are emotionally trading.  Sometimes I have managed to pull it off and get back to break even but often times if you get smoked in the morning it's tough to pull off a comeback given most shit has made its nice move by the afternoon.  Sometimes u get a nice move but a lot of times that just isn't the case.  So it's probably better for me after a hot streak to just wire out the funds now to say 40k and if I'm an idiot and I blow 15k I'm now at margin call status on the account and I will have to wire funds in to keep trading which should maybe get me to somewhat come down from my retarded revenge state of mind.  Vs if you have 110k in your account and u blow 15k whats to stop you from going through another 15 to 20k the money is there.  Some people say well you should have the control or discipline but I know myself and sometimes I just don't have it even though I know I should.   So having the smaller account is just like having a daily loss limit for me. Schwab won't let me set up a daily loss limit anyways.  Just look at the sub Reddit for loss and you have people that are smart or should be smart and they piss through 300k of money chasing losses.  If they maybe didn't have that huge balance in their account they might of stopped and been like wtf is wrong with me and what am I doing. Money in your bank account is real but trading account money is like chips at a casino.

**[Generative design](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative design)**

Generative design is an iterative design process that involves a program that will generate a certain number of outputs that meet certain constraints, and a designer that will fine tune the feasible region by selecting specific output or changing input values, ranges and distribution. The designer doesn't need to be a human, it can be a test program in a testing environment or an artificial intelligence, for example a generative adversarial network. The designer learns to refine the program (usually involving algorithms) with each iteration as their design goals become better defined over time.The output could be images, sounds, architectural models, animation, and much more. It is therefore a fast method of exploring design possibilities that is used in various design fields such as art, architecture, communication design, and product design.The process combined with the power of digital computers that can explore a very large number of possible permutations of a solution enables designers to generate and test brand new options, beyond what a human alone could accomplish, to arrive at a most effective and optimized design.

You're welcome.
I am afraid AI is not to blame for aesthetic and ergonomic decisions. This is something that humans are very much involved in.
I was referring to AI in the context of assisting in designing optimal a layout or shapes of components: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_design
In essence, you manufacturer could pass high-level design options and the AI will run a number of simulations that will optimize any number of factors: aerodynamics, wheelbase dimensions, braking distance, head room, etc.

Everything can be tested within high accuracy using modern CAD software. The key thing here is to have data collected from actual cars driven on roads (in the case of a car company). This additional data can really augment the design to be the most optimum. If a product is not instrumented (cars not having sensors) the manufacturer is losing out on a lot. This is especially true when your competitor is capturing terabytes of data every day.

Of course, add-on features can be developed such as self-driving, etc. For this, again, you need to be receiving data from the products.

"AvePoint expects to generate approximately $148 million in total revenue for the year ending December 31, 2020, which would be an increase of approximately 26% over 2019 revenue."

I'm not familiar with this company, but a brief look tells me it's a software company. Would 26% revenue growth be too low then given the best software companies are growing 50%+ with SNOW and ZM 100%+?

In the USA the tax man likes an itemized list, otherwise they can't easily calculate whether you're lying about how much you made/lost. 

Maybe they ignore it if you don't trade much, but I got sent a letter the first year I had a few hundred thousand in trades because they thought there might have been some unreported income. There wasn't, but they had no way of knowing that. Easier just to let Turbotax create and send them the list automatically from your broker, that way they don't bother you.
ARKG 4/21 $90c x11
If she doesn't stick her tongue up your bumhole, you're wasting money
They misquoted ARK, it was $7,000 pre split, should have stated $1,400 in this article.  
  
Edit:typo

What's the risk? They'd still have to pay him $124 per share. Not actually risking the 12k.

By that analysis, it also means Logitech has already accessed a majority of their possible market. So they either have to make a better product than Corsair or just stay course.

Corsair has only accessed a portion of their market and has shown interest in expanding, seems like a good sign that even if they aren‚Äôt actually financially better off than Logi we should see a similar share price within a year or 2 at most. There‚Äôs just too much growth potential and a better reputation for Corsair to ride.

Merger vote is 1/21.  Only holding a few 1/15s, might role them out next Monday.  Feeling a bit pensive about the obligatory post merger SPAC dip, but think  üõ∂ has the potential meme hard on WSB after ticker change.  

1.) GOEV ticker
2.) Bangbus memes
3.) Shortbus memes

If it catches on with the sub, I can see it running.  

Also, I like the company, and genuinely think they will be successful.  I‚Äôll be going long on them after the merger completes and I see how the dust settles.  I think their tech is solid,  and their approach is novel.  expect more partnership agreements to be forthcoming, if they can get a partnership with Uber or Lyft it‚Äôs gonna moon.

Honestly trading 10 lots of tsla near the money options is probably not the best strategy for people with say a 30k account.  I keep my account small so I can't do dumb revenge trading to myself as easily. I have a lot more money than what I keep in my trading account so I am more comfortable trading this size.  For beginner day traders I wouldn't advise the same risk I am taking on this small of an account.

I run the WSB sentiment site I can also agree with something similar to this. WSB doesn‚Äôt have much predictive power other than the fact they normally jump on trends for quality stocks a lot sooner than most of retail and possibly big funds. For example, buying PLTR around $20 before retail jumped on and pumped it to $30.

Might do an in-depth analysis on WallStreetBets‚Äô  ability to pick stocks that are usually quality long-term holds.

Tesla pauses production of Model S, Model X - report


Tesla is planning to pause production of its Model S and Model X starting from December 24, CNBC reported, citing an email to company employees.

The halt in production will last for 18 days but workers will only get one week of paid leave. For the rest of the pause in production, Tesla encouraged its workers to volunteer to work at other projects in the factory in Fremont.

Bet safely!

If it happens early next year, it'll be about 200%.  If it doesn't happen until Nov of next year, it'll be roughly 180%.  Expiration decay will only be about 20% in 2021.  The other 80% will come off in 2022.

Obama had a unique situation. His inauguration was just one month shy of the Great Recession bottom in 2009. Economic policy of his first term was spent entirely on recovery (aka, pump).

The second term he was much more hands-off on economic policy. The Fed just slowly turned the boat around out of recovery mode. The first interest rate increases since 2007 happened in Obama's second term.

Trump has been the opposite of hands-off. He basically threatened to fire the Chairman of the Fed on a daily basis until he got the interest rate changes he wanted.

I agree with you. I mean, ultimately who knows what will happen.

I did buy 10 $48.5C 1/22 Friday before close. I knew approval would be announced and am anticipating a little bump on Monday morning. Plan is to sell half this week and the rest next week.

Iron condors from my knowledge require you to pull out once you've made around 30 percent profit.
Basically you want options between 4-8 weeks out in case you buy in a weird spot and get fucked and have to hold for a while. Weeklies are good for lotto gambling on catalyst events. LEAPs are great for long term holding stuff you think is gonna just keep going up over time like SPY historically has done or if you‚Äôre super bullish/bearish on a specific company from its current point.

I don't focus too much on politics. Unless watching a few YouTube videos on Trump being a cock and Biden being nice grandpa counts for anything. 

Bernie is definitely all for the people. He was even against homophobia in the 80s or 90s, a rarity. Warren wants to forgive students of up to $50,000 which literally solves nothing long-term. Democrat candidates just in general seemed "all for the people" vibey. 

I had no idea Biden was like that with student loans. But he probably voted for that decades ago. Maybe he's changed

Considering the amount of memes and propaganda relating those two, you'd be remiss to discount it entirely either. 

While you raise some very good points, manual design still takes into account aesthetics and the human factor which an AI might miss entirely.

Having driven the model S myself, it's a nice ride but ergonomically no that great and doesn't *really* compete with other cars in that price range.

Tesla has solve many problems and continues to solve many problems, but glaring weird spots like the glove box oddly tiny continue to arise, and that's something AI will continue to miss until it develops further.

I got back home and 5 other people around the globe did the same reports. All were scrapped immediately except for the one that came from the company's origin country. Training? Torture? Abuse?

You first have to pick which momentum to go with. Usually it's calls with TSLA. Then look at the walls. They were at 610 and 620 on Friday and the price would hit 611 and then eventually 615-619 and then back. Of course you can get caught off guard because it did eventually break 610 and went to 602. It's a risky game but my options are only open for 15-30 minutes max leaving a little tiny window for error.

Options pricing for 0dte or same week expirations moves really fast with the price of the stock. Say TSLA was at 610 and the 620c was at 3.00 a contract. That same contract will be closer to 9.00 of TSLA jumps to 620 within 30 minutes, which is very possible with TSLA. I watched it rise and fall every 15 minutes. There was a point near the end of the day were the price was .40 a contract and quickly became 1.20. that's 300%

get the fuck over it it's really not a big deal
it's a fun gadget if you like cooking. I only really use it for pork, like pulled pork, tenderloins, chops. and corned beef. it's also good for mass cooking. or cooking a cheap steak to make it a bit more tender. I generally only buy rib eye though, so I always cook that stove top/oven , and chicken I always bake/pan cook. same with fish. they go on sale for like $75-$90 , and you can get a good polycarb bin to put it in for like $20. so again, it's worth it if you like cooking and messing around, that's about it.
And I have calls expiring on 12/24. Oh how the tables have turned.

Biden is by no means a different kind of politician. His playbook will be in every way "standard."

Biden will have the Fed do what every administration has done since the 80s--QE out the ass and kick the can until it's someone else's problem.
At no point I suggested that. If you can read, I was pointing out that government officials lied to us
His reflection shows a proven autist that does not look like a üåàüêª whose wife has had boyfriends long before she knew about his closet adventures. 

No shame in holding bags of diamonds.

Yes they compete with VLDR, but VLDR has the most patents on the tech tho doesn‚Äôt stop Waymo from making their own, VLDR is the industry leader, that‚Äôs why Waymo is trying to compete with them, albeit unsuccessfully

Once I ordered a large popcorn at the movie theatre and after the employee filled up the container I changed my mind and asked for a medium. The employee poured my large popcorn into a medium bag and it filled it up with nothing left over. Turns out the large was the same amount as the medium, they just put it in a deceptively shaped container that made it look bigger.

This is not an Iron Condor. An Iron Condor would be something like Buy 160P Sell 165P Sell 170C Buy 175C - If UPS falls in between 165 and 170 you would keep your credit.

You have a put credit spread that cost you $1000 with UPS below 165 and a call credit spread that cost you $1000 with UPS above 175.

basically you are in a box that under all circumstances you will pay $1000.

How much credit did you get when you sold this?

It will cost you about $1000 to buy it back.

I would load the whole thing up in your trade window and buy it back.

Sell to close 165P buy to close 175P buy to close 165C sell to close 175P

Good luck.

Just buy 300 shares of PLTR and start selling covered calls 10% OTM. The volatility makes you big money and if your positions get assigned, who cares, you still made a profit.

2 Buck Chuck. 

In 2002, recession hit, leading to a massive wine surplus. Franzia decided he needed to offload some of his bottles, so he headed to Trader Joe's. When it started being sold on the shelves of Trader Joe's for just $2 a bottle, Charles Shaw wine became Two-Buck Chuck.
My bet is and it's really just my bet on the subject, I don't think the mechanisms to start loaning out those shares are automatic enough to get them loaned out the same day their brought in. Also I believe that most index funds don't loan out their shares.

The short shares may or may not help much, and may cause more problems.

For JS they can catch it by scraping your website and finding their code, followed by a lawsuit.

For a docker image/container exposed over the internet, it's much tougher. In theory I guess the author could sue if they suspect something and, through legal discovery, figure out that you're using the code. If you're a random company it's unlikely to happen though.

"Go back to r/investing" lmao get off my lawn. 

Your copy paste supports my opinion. The write up says 40-50% of the market is passive and it starts to have a big impact on price discovery. Currently it's about 20%, which dilutes price discovery, but the market isn't in some crazy price-inefficient bubble *because of passive index investing*. We have high PE ratios market wide because of interest rate and treasury policy, more people investing than ever before (due to pandemic boredom and time), and a rise speculative investing particularly in low revenue high growth tech. 

When passive investing has made active management obsolete, I'll buy into the idea that Burry is selling. Synthetic CDOs were based on one huge bad assumption (real estate never goes down), with massive fraud by investment banks and an industry of misaligned incentives and predatory lending. Passive index investing is not based on "equity never goes down", it's based on holding through the down periods, diversification across the entire economy and not needing withdrawals until 30 years later. It may dilute price discovery, but as long as active trading exists, so does price discovery. 

As long as pump and dumps, insider trading, and every other bullshit practice goes on, efficient market theory is a fairytale anyway. Everything is always priced in? Give me a break, a stock is worth what someone will pay for it.

1 through 10 years are usually all taken into consideration for any valuation. They have been beating on revenue and earnings expectations. Just go look at any peg ratio and compare to other companies peg ratio. Tsla valuation is cheap right now if they can maintain the growth. It‚Äôs considered higher risk because of the high weighted reliance on the growth. Do some basic valuation modelling yourself if you want to see how long it would take to hit whatever figures you care about or want to compare to.

Lmao i got randomly assigned a film major as a roommate in college after my buddy dropped out 1 day before move in.

Dude was the biggest f a g ever. Always on my ass about cleaning (I have actual ocd about cleaning and somehow it wasn‚Äôt clean enough for him), taking up too much room in the fridge (he‚Äôd bake casseroles that to him took priority over whatever random leftovers I had in the fridge at the time), music too loud when it was at mid volume on computer speakers. 

I made fun of him to his face all the time and he just laughed. Then one day i invited a couple friends over and it kind of turned into a mid day party. I didn‚Äôt think he was home so I lit up a cig inside and this dude comes flying down the stairs and starts screaming about his security deposit. My boy deadpans:

‚ÄúFuck now I feel bad. We should have asked first...He‚Äôs gonna need every penny after graduating with that degree.‚Äù

Dude turned red as a raw meatball and left for the weekend without packing a bag. Felt pretty shitty about it later but holy fuck it was funny when we were drunk.

Got any further info on that?
Yes, you don‚Äôt have to do anything. That‚Äôs how SPACs work. It‚Äôs possible but very unlikely for the stock price to go below 10. On the day we vote if we want the merger, you can also vote no and you‚Äôll get 10 per share. It doesn‚Äôt happen often as they don‚Äôt make money unless the merger happens. Once the merger goes through, the stock ticker will automatically change in 1 to 2 days. Then you have no protection and it can go below 10 like all other stocks.

I agree. I'm managing the IV and theta burn by selling 3 covered calls for 640 against my shares. Because of this I'm actually positive theta, but keeping my upside and also hedging against a fall. This play makes money compared to just holding the shares as long as the price stays under 670. So far, the ATH is 660. If it goes to 800, I lose out on some potential profit, but if it falls again, I get money from my CCs to use to roll down my other calls to a better strike. at which point, I'll probably just hold both the calls and my shares without a cover until friday and hope for the best.

Theta is derived from the price movement in the market and the actual option price not the other way around. It‚Äôs not a consistent factor of an option

So the calculator is going off the basic assumption that when a call flips to being the next expiry date it gets thetafucked immediately

The idea of a poor mans covered call is to finish with max profit. IE have both finish ITM. Example

Buy TSLA 615c dec 24 and sell the 625c. Max profit comes from both being ITM. Cost of spread 4.55 so you would profit $645 from this spread if it finished ITM. Max loss would be the $455 cost of premium. Do some more research on debit spreads.

If you had just done a straddle instead of an IC, you would be able to recover over a few rolls.  Since you have the wings for protection, there's really not much you can do.  Inverting is only useful when you're naked.  Either take the loss or drop the wings and claw your way back (i.e. roll out and un-invert for credit or net even).

Edit: or keep the position and pray it pegs $168 on Dec18.

Buy and hold has been performing better since 2009

https://investps.com/is-selling-options-still-worth-the-risk/

The article that OP linked is outdated and ends at around 2012. Any strategy that gets too popular can get overcrowded and lose its alpha. You can tell wheel is already too popular because theres been multiple posts by wsb autists claiming that its free money and providing diy guides to retards that dont understand what option greeks are.

Its also true that you can leverage to achieve better returns, but then you introduce massive tail risk, ie getting completely crushed by gamma on big down moves since not only are you getting fucked on your long delta, youre also getting fucked by the increase of IV that is usually associated with big down moves.

Unsurprisingly, wheel has massively underperformed buy and hold in 2020. Do it at your own risk

I think a lot of the recent run-up is actually shorts covering their positions together with FOMO. But a lot of new short positions have been opened because of the size of this run-up. Historically, big stocks rise a total of 10-15% the day before and the day after the inclusion, and then fall. It's not clear whether that's enough of a spike to cause a short squeeze, but even if it is, the short position on TSLA is much smaller than it was 6-9 months ago. Only 0.8 days of trading required to cover all the shorts.

Positions: 300 shares TSLA, -3 TSLA 640c, 2 TSLA 12/18 650c.
I was replying to the part where he said people said that in 2009, which I thought was pretty obvious since I only referred to 2009.

college with no worries of money would be the greatest life experience ever

You never get something like college ever again. My friends I met there, ya we are still friends to this day but back then we saw each other daily. Trying to get more than 4 people together is now a chore. Literally impossible at times. I'm talking pre covid times. 

I miss that so fucking much just living with my bros, seeing them daily. Raging every weekend. He could have bought a house by campus, threw some sick parties. Even if he hates partying just having that amount of cash to fuck with at that age. I would have gone abroad to study for a year. So many options. 

As I'm older it hurts more seeing that post. Knowing what he could have but chose literally the worst path possible. And him going nrrrrr my parents don't know heehee; I'm going to live off 500k for the rest of my life, I'm a genius. So dumb.

Assuming a rational individual in a free market abstains from lattes for a year because of the long-term utility of such an action, and assuming that said individual consumes an average of 1 latte priced at $3 every day over the course of the year, that individual could have $1,095 dollars in their portfolio by the end of the year. Assuming said portfolio sees average market growth of 8%, in just two years it could be worth the total of the missed lattes+87.6 dollars! Assuming the loss of the latte causes this individual operating rationally in a free market no decrease in happiness and quality of life, one can assume that a rationally self-governing individual would choose to invest latte money into the market rather than burning it up! 

Therefore, if you see someone buying a latte, make sure to inform them that they are acting irrationally and that they shouldn't expect a handout from you when their spending habits lead to bankruptcy.

So i watched one TSLA call all day friday (620c) and saw that there were at least 3 times I could make 300% within a day from the swings. That's the only stock that swings in huge increments daily. Day trading TSLA might be the way.

650 is reasonable but a 580/630 spread would be more ideal because of the insane IV. People wanting 800 by next Friday are just asking to burn your money.  You might get a quick flip on them if Tesla gaps up on Monday and Tuesday but a 32% move is asking too much for a stock that‚Äôs already up 44% in the past month

They're both right - just different timelines.
All in 246 shares @ 13.3, zeroed my fun money budget this Friday. Despite the hype on WSB, holding GME through earnings really wasn't based on rationale. You hype-masters almost had me though, I almost didn't sell.

Selling before earnings and now buying back at a lower price allowed me to own 52 more shares for basically the same amount of money and I'm glad that's the case. GME now has so much hype behind it that I just don't see myself losing money on holding shares for the next 3-6 months.

I sometimes wish I put all of my savings into this, but that's outside of my personal risk tolerance.
Let me ask
This isn‚Äôt a yolo unless it was expiring this week.

Gtfo out op

Before it ran up huge.  Like the 2nd day after it merged, when it didn‚Äôt run, I locked in profits.  And then it rocketed up lol.  Could have made another $750k or so.  Missed it by a few hours.  Shares went to $90

Yes, I expect that is true. I think a household making 100-150k could make it into the top 10% with good money management, but we wouldn't expect to see anyone like that on this sub.

I definitely acknowledge this as a possibility. Counter point: dollar cost averaging by putting in $59 every trading day, and eventually TSLA *could* make it back up and to $1.5T cap. If only screwing with shares, then that's still an amazing gain. Just wondering how long it might take.

Really been mulling over putting my entire $75k portfolio into TSLA shares. Maybe the occasional LEAPS if it dips a bit, and the occasional covered call. Then contributing $59 a day straight into TSLA shares ($15k contribution a year).

Then everyone gets all bearish on me, and calls me a retard. I'm starting to think that I should because I don't settle for the mediocrity here. Could be filthy rich or lose 50% of it all.. only one way to find out..

Hey, that was stupid. But fortunately, you can still sell this contract for most of what you paid for it because delta is extremely low. Sell on monday and promise yourself you'll never do something like this again.

I first started buying TQQQ in May 2016. It‚Äôs been a joyride but I have sold calls every now and then. It‚Äôs important to be careful because one fine day I was told that XIV (inverse of VIX) will be shut down after a market crash. Lost $80K total in the blink of an eye.

If SPCE is a good investment, why are you so hilariously insecure about it? You think about dicks *a lot* for a "straight" man. When you invested doesn't matter to me. SPCE will be bankrupt by 2024 and if you stay in I'll enjoy the loss porn.

I have zero buying power atm but want to get into this. Will probably get out of AP.XT to do so. It seems a great play my only issue is they‚Äôre merging early jan whilst US mortgages are getting bad press and if further stimulus isn‚Äôt passed the housing market could be fuk.

Agree. Took all my profits from RAD on Thursday and put it into **GLD** $175c for 12/31.

There was some massive option buying on Friday for $175-180 strikes for next couple months. Something like $11m compared to $5m for puts.

WHAT SHOULD I BUY MONDAY?
Gilead (GILD) Has the only approved treatment (Remdesiver) for coronavirus and its stock price has done nothing but go down for the last few months. They got a sweetheart of a deal from the govt for it as well. The Pfizer vaccine will be one of many, and it is the hardest to give. It requires two shots, and to be transported and stored in ultra freezers. Pfizer is also a large market cap company, the vaccine will do very little to affect it's stock prce, expect maybe a small bump or not even that.

I agree. I did a Fib Retrace on ToS and it's been bouncing off those levels like clockwork. I wouldn't be surprised to see this back down to $28 (61.8 level). Under $30 is 100% bag-loading time.

My sister got one a few months, it‚Äôs still brand new in the box. I think it would be hilarious to white elephant it to my mom without her knowledge. She clearly has zero interest in it.
Maybe....I‚Äôd be cautious though.

I think this pandemic has a 9/11 effect where behavior will change permanently. The stigma of mask wearing has been blown away so I expect it to be a new normal for flu season at least.

Additionally the obsession with disinfectant will linger.

I think it‚Äôs a fair bet but I don‚Äôt think the behavioral change translating to fewer sales will happen for a long while.

You need to read every single line of the perspectus.  A lot of these ETFs are pretty scammy.  These products are not there to make you money, they are there to get you to invest your money.  More than one of these funds have a bubble-popper clause that says that if they don't meet a certain performance point the whole fund is dismantled.  I'll use MRRL as an example, $14 to nothing overnight.  No easy money out there but DD will keep you in the game.
I mean looking at the chart for the last few months... It kind of looks like a staircase going up lol idk

Good point. Same in Taiwan.
I mean... you're not wrong
In order to achieve a sufficient leverage ratio, the etfs (such as tqqq) usually use future contracts as a vehicle. These contracts have an expiration date, and unfortunately, must be swapped for the newer contracts once the expiration date is reached. What you will find, is that the different future contracts (on say ES or NQ) are all not priced the same to prevent arbitrage opportunities amongst other things. This difference in pricing is called contango, where further out contracts usually hold a premium (similar to options) as opposed to closer to expiration contracts. The decay on this premium may not have a major effect on leveraged funds in the near term, but in the long term it can be a killer. Other etfs use options as a leverage vehicle, which obviously have theta decay. There is also just multiplicity decay, which really starts to kick in during volatile markets.

hmmm... I am also puts on SPY as well as SPXU....  Plus have 8 calls expiring Friday at 690.....  

Although I will bail out of those on Wed/thursday morning if price is less than 700 by then.  

I think there is only a 10% chance of an infinity squeeze Friday night/ monday morning so will set up some way way out of the money limit sell orders on owned stocks, just in case.
It‚Äôs approved for emergency use, and will still be considered experimental. Hasn‚Äôt even been tested on animals. We have a few weeks/months of clinical data, but sure one would be ***crazy*** to not view it as 100% safe

Slippage is very real, but people usually don't understand slippage. Leveraged ETFs don't all go to zero.  

I don't think a long term position in a leveraged ETF is dumb. But you should fully understand the risk. That includes how the fund accomplishes its objective, slippage, liquidity, liquidation, and high expense ratio. If you understand all that and you're willing to risk it, go for it.

You ever wonder how much money you would have made if you didn't sell all the stock you purchased?  My Robinhood history is a gold mine here are a few of my all time favorites.  I had 1000 AMD Shares at 4$ that I paperhanded at a loss back in 2016.  Owned 10k of NVDA at 40$ and sold for a small profit.  My favorite this year is  SQ I bought during the march dip @ 43$ sold at 90$  Flipped the profits into Square 6/2021 leaps back in July and of course paper handed those as well and sold at a small loss.   Disney Leaps?  Yup had those too right after Covid.  OF course fucked them off as well and couldn't stick to the course.  So yea I'm a paper handed bitch and down 40% this year in the best bull market in history.

They greedy. The know they can get more since nobody knows pricing. However, it timing is off, they can be screwed. Just think if WeWork and Theranos were able to IPO fast enough. They would have won, just ask Trevor Milton.
Fun fact: when long term capital management failed and Greenspan and the NY Fed orchestrated a bailout by rounding up large financial institutions to help unwind the portfolio in an orderly manner, there were two notable exceptions:

Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers

Bear declined to participate, Lehman kicked in the least amount of funding.

A decade later, the 2 most notable collapses of the GFC? Lehman was allowed to fail and Bear was acquired for pennies on the dollar by JP Morgan.

Well if I lose it all I promise to post that too haha. Hopefully not.  But with trading you never know.  I feel like I'm obviously doing some right because when I traded back in 2009 and I couldn't afford to lose the money I never made any kind of serious money.  I'm actually getting Green Day's that offset my red days.  I made money every single day last week up until This Monday I got annoyed that my plan got fucked up and then I let that transfer into my trading. I was trying to buy tsla on the break of 607 and when it went my stupid order didn't go through cuz I was trying to buy 500 shares that I didn't have the buying power for lol.

Did you know that some option contracts don't follow the usual 100 shares-per-contract standard?

Your trading application probably has some way to hide these. You should turn that on if they're not hidden by default. In e-trade it's here: [https://imgur.com/a/cgJrVN9](https://imgur.com/a/cgJrVN9)

I'm reposting this because it got downvoted by people who think I'm wrong. I'm not. Here's an article about this specific issue: [https://www.thebluecollarinvestor.com/non-standard-options-what-they-are-and-why-we-should-avoid-them/](https://www.thebluecollarinvestor.com/non-standard-options-what-they-are-and-why-we-should-avoid-them/#:~:text=These%20are%20options%20that%20don,extraordinary%20dividend%20or%20stock%20split).

Management openly stated months ago that there would be no guidance this year and that Q3 would be bad. Everyone expected it to be priced in.

Algos got a hold of the numbers and the stock started to rise. It was only a few minutes later that the shelf offering was noticed and that is what tanked the price. Without the shelf offering there would not have been a selloff. Nobody could have predicted that considering recent buybacks and still being authorized to do more buybacks.

I've been doing this since fall of 2018. Started with 300k but took that money out of that account.  Broke even 2018 and a small profit in 2019.  I trade big on a small account because I can afford the risk. I'm planning to wire out majority of these funds to get me back to 35 or 40k.  Back in may I went from 100k to 145k and then had a bad day of negative 15k shorting ZS on earnings day thinking it should go back down and it was a terrible idea.  That led me to do some dumb revenge trading which lost me another quick 45k.   I was up almost 125k YTD profit in may and then gave back almost half that amount in about 2 weeks.  That was a big kick in nuts and tested my confidence so much so that I was worried I would continue to revenge trade so I drastically reduced my account size to 35k by wiring out funds.   I then took that 35k back to 95k by August and wired out the funds once again back to 35k.  And now I'm back up again so I'm nervous my confidence will get me into trouble again oversizing shit.  If I have my account at 35k and try to revenge trade I will get it shut down by Schwab if it goes below 25k.  Which then causes you to rethink and get out of a revenge trader mindset.  Compare that to if you have a 100k account and you have a 10k down day it's very easy to get stupid and lose another 20k because u have huge buying power and your pissed off and trading emotionally.  I guess I have started to get to know myself better.

Dont need Cohen even, company is being 70% shorted and not going bankrupt. Combine that with an embarrassingly low market cap for their revenue. Looking at it from a chart perspective there is support around $13 continuing on a bullish trend, $17+ certainly wasnt sustainable right now. I'm buying shares to hold. The rate of growth of their ecommerce, strategic closing of stores and cash on hand has me very optimistic looking 1yr+ out. I'm also very young and retarded, and have money to throw around so fuck it.

The inexperience of not knowing which options to avoid due to risk is a big reason people hit it so big their first time they buy retard shit that has like a 1% chance of actually occuring and then somehow they catch a bull run immediately after buying and its suddenly +1000% - happens every fuckin time forever spoils the joy in steady returns and gains because you just keep thinking everything should be a ten bagger when most never see that in their lifetime.

So AirBnb, good company and all that but really worth that much? I cannot find data on the amount of current renters, I can see upto 2019 but not for 2020. Looking at London vacancies right now and there is only about 50 in the city and there used to be hundreds. I know covid and all that but in a post covid world many people will stop letting random people in their house. Then there is the people who one apartments and use Airbnb to pay the mortgage, they will be getting hit with a wave of foreclosures from the travel restrictions and lockdowns. I have not looked at other cities to check numbers as I am lazy and baked but thinking about it, I think there is a storm brewing and will be buying puts/shorting, starting small.

LMAO! I forgot about maplestory.
It's true. I saw some options that were way too cheap for the price of the stock and I called my broker and they were confused at first then they looked into it and saw that the contract was for 60 shares and fixed amount of cash instead of the usual 100 shares. otherwise I was gonna buy a shit ton of them, exercise them, and make a bunch of money arbitraging the difference.

Here's an article about it: [https://www.thebluecollarinvestor.com/non-standard-options-what-they-are-and-why-we-should-avoid-them/](https://www.thebluecollarinvestor.com/non-standard-options-what-they-are-and-why-we-should-avoid-them/#:~:text=These%20are%20options%20that%20don,extraordinary%20dividend%20or%20stock%20split)

It did.  I made mistakes of course.  No perfect entries or exits.  My highest percentage return was actually Virgin Galactic.  It should have been Tattooed Chef.  My proudest move was after buying Nikola, VTIQ at the time, and losing a big chunk in mid-March, I bought back in at a higher price, with renewed conviction, realizing I had gotten cold feet but was right the first time.  That is very hard to do.  But I made mistakes too.

You pay tax on what you earned. It's really not super complicated. After you made that 90k in taxable income you can literally set that cash on fire and you're still on the hook. You can deduct 3k in losses for the year and maybe roll the rest of your losing to further years, though.

The more I learn about options the more I realize they really arent a good investment idea. They really only work in small numbers as a hedging strategy and using them anyother way is just 500$ scratch offs.
This is is a harsh truth for me

I‚Äôd say the black swan event chance is some non-zero  number. Is it a 1 in 8 chance? I don‚Äôt think so. I think the same with the golden goose. It‚Äôs a triple witching week so lots of money going to be flowing in the market in general. Tesla could rocket and the market would not have to make a 10% corresponding drop. Shorting the SPY is a good insight I hadn‚Äôt considered but that‚Äôs mostly disaster insurance and less so picking up backend money after the Tesla pullback after spike. My debate is 12/18 vs 12/24 expy dates. I‚Äôm torn.

I am a TMT consultant who tracks telecom companies for a living. My opinion is that LUMN may be a decent buy and hold for the dividends but it is not going to moon like some of you are saying (unless this sub pumps it, idk, then honestly the sky is the limit but bewared the dump blah blah blah). LUMN is pretty much a pure ILEC, not a tech company. Their main line of business is enterprise connectivity and networking (literally laying and hooking up fiber for companies, and setting up WANs), which isn't terribly exciting in this day and age, and they are honestly being outperformed in this segment by VZ, T, the cable cos, etc. Their consumer business is laughable and probably will be scrapped/divested soon - this brings no value to the company. 5G isn't going be much of a catalyst for them - they aren't a wireless company, and all the big wireless players (except maybe TMUS in the short term and possibly DISH) are likely to do their own backhaul (even if they don't there are a LOT of fiber players, big and small who will compete here). They do have a solid government contracting business, but as I recall this is not a significant portion of revenues. If you look at their financials, yeah they had a pretty good last quarter but they have really been struggling for years prior, and have a pretty heavy debt load from the L3 acquisiton and later investments. While I don't think the company is going anywhere soon (telecoms is a boomer business, companies are poorly managed except for like TMUS and VZ but they all seem to stick around), the stock price isn't either. Though I think it would be hilarious if LUMM becomes a meme stock so yeah go ahead and buy calls
Why the interest in RYCEY lately? I seen it mentioned a few times here. It's a boomer car company.
I thought that's what everyone here did

I‚Äôm generally looking for entries early in a move where I‚Äôve done my homework and have conviction. Try to stay away from having weak hands.  Know the companies you invest in, and if you can learn technicals that helps.  Then you‚Äôll cut and run when it makes sense, but won‚Äôt churn yourself, buying high and selling low.
Samsonite, I was way off.
That‚Äôs my strategy because theta work better last week. I did spreads a few weeks ago and it barely moved or of it did I was in 20% profit then held til the last of expiration and I lost it all so it was like a waste of time. Like this week I‚Äôm doing AMZN credit put spreads at 3000/3005 12/18
why is that dumb tho. i‚Äôm sure it is i just can‚Äôt see why. i have june calls for 40,35, and 30.

For naked calls and puts, .yeah,.try to sell asap...50% max profit.unless I feel it really has moved.in my favor. For spreads, will let them ride longer.

Out of the money and in the money. 

If you buy a call out of the money, it means that the strike price (the price your contract says you can buy shares at) is above the stock price. In this way, it‚Äôs ‚Äúout of the money‚Äù because it does not make sense to exercise your contract (why buy something at a higher price?). 

If you buy a call in the money, it means that the strike price is below the stock price. So you can exercise the contract any time.

To some it up I trade against the trend unfortunately. Like if the market went down too much I don‚Äôt wanna do call credit spreads and vice versa. But I was bullish for several months and market just never went in my favor. I know the trend is your friend to the very end but I‚Äôm hardheaded.

Options are a side play and don't directly affect the share price in the same way as taking a long position.

Stocks with that kind of volatility are heavily traded by retail investors buying *and selling* intraday, with less net movement. 

That's far from an exhaustive reason, but it's one reason for high volatility stocks to be heavily retail and not move massively until there's a spike that interests institutions and triggers algos. More relevant to penny stocks, but certainly has a bearing here.

Rkt went all the way to 40$ before investors realised it was overpriced for its IPO price of 18$. Now it's 21$. UWM is a much better company so technically minimum should be 18-21$. Which is still 100% upside potential.

You don't think CVS is priced in? They've already had a good run up this year but I kind of want to get back into them. Not sure though.
Anyone know if losses on 1/15 options would count towards Tax writeoffs this year?
The calls side is harder to predict. Call walls do not always behave like put walls. 

Either pin, sell off or nothing.
Hmm, they‚Äôve broken way above their upper Bollinger band. Money flow looks nice but are approaching overbought. I think it could go either way. Best of luck. I‚Äôm loaded up with NVAX calls for 1/15

TNA has been so good to me. Missed the explosive bit right after the election, but it slowly keeps growing. Any positive VAX news adds lift. Great long dated play fer shure.

I assume you mean big red or big green days since it doesn't just alternate red and green like that. Measure your results and keep tweaking your strategy until you have something that has at a least 55% win rate. 

With the right money and risk management plan, you could win with even less than 50% but higher is better.

This near term shutdown of Tesla factory for the S/X line indicates a retooling of the factory to accommodate the S/X refresh.

I like Zynga, I really do. They've been beating expectations, raising guidance, and beating that shit again for the last 4-5 quarters. However, investors are concerned on their lack of core organic growth, given most of their current growth is driven by acquisitions (Peak and Rollic this year, contributing \~20 pts of their Y/Y topline growth).

They need to prove they can execute beyond just doing acquisitions. If so, they'll be massively underpriced.

During this shutdown period (which every large manufacturing plant ever has) essential line maintenance will be carried out to prevent breakdowns which would cause downtime which means less cars which means less tendies.

To be perfectly clear, I have no idea what I'm talking about with this stock.  I'm just an underemployed sociologist that wants to overcome a series of poor life decisions who lives at home with their mother who stands in front of the house and shouts obscenities at passerby and their neighbors.  My humble goal is to be able to highlight my new found wealth to my shithead brother through shrewd investing in stonks.

If I were to speculate on value to this company it'd be these things:

1. it's their under the sea cables or something from LVL 3-whatever about these
2. naming rights for the Seattle Seahawks stadium--whatever
3. The whole zoom deal may actually be really big, considering zoom will need bandwith or something due to it's exponential growth--maybe
4. some people say that this is a 5g play because they have existing infrastructure that they rent out---could be
5. If this company becomes fairly valued at 22, then a bunch of WSB retards become wealthy on par with the boomer retardees who have thousands of shares for this stocks dividend--indicative of large scale retarded behavior
6. I believe that boomers may get fomo and take this stock more seriously as the dividend yield decreases and the stock price goes up.  It becomes more rational as the price increases.
7. I guess there's like 10 percent short interest
8. Door Dash is emblematic of how overvalued this market is.  In perspective, this company has refinanced their debt and appears relatively stable-whatever.
9. If I knew how to do iron condors, I would, because I've been obsessed with this company and their stock has stayed between 10 and 11 the last month.
10. If this company passes 11, or something, something about resistance or something.

Down 30% 2 weeks out, hoping tsla can turn around Monday for a profit
So one of my friend got into stock this march and she just told me that she has noticed the stock goes down when the weather is gloomy or rainy and it goes up when the weather is sunny and bright. 
I would love what would be your response to this comment.
I bough Pfizer the day before they first got approval in any country. Be conservative with the call value you pick, their stock doesn‚Äôt move much.
TBH good thought but no it wont.

This is because all the money retail traders have put into the market is so minuscule in the grand scheme. Like one good day and SPY will gain more than all of the money WFH traders have in total.

Plus its not like all of the retail traders are going to take it out the same week.

Careful with your wording there. You've got some words in the same sentence that should never be when talking about stocks in a public forum. Also, calls are not relatively cheap. They're still at over 100% IV, which means a big move is already priced in. Understandable since the stock doubled in a month, and then lost about a third of its value in about 2.5 weeks.

The biggest fuckups I've had so far have been buying anything (options or shares) in the first hour or so after market open. Not *selling*, but buying specifically. Usually it's FOMO after reading these daily threads, ironically

They can't raise rates because of the debt. In the 1970s they raised rates to 20% to stop the inflation. Not possible now because the debt payments would consume the entire federal budget.
Only problem i‚Äôve had is cars rendering in late. But latest patch apparently fixed a lot of things

No, that should print like fuck. Those have a better chance to print than mine, but mine are just longer out so I have more time. But I need them to keep moving a lot. I really believe in Cathie and the ARK funds, especially ARKK. So I went risky and long term.

With shares, if it‚Äôs a decent company, most investment mistakes are made by selling. Key words being if it‚Äôs a decent company. So not a random spac, etc. which is high risk. Think like perhaps Chewy. It‚Äôs definitely growing a strong, not boring like a lot of safe companies, but still safe. That‚Äôs a good stock to hold long term.
The thing is those overvalued stocks never returned to those insane valuations whereas other ones did.

Friday is going to have some crazy forced volume in the market as a whole, and TSLA especially. A lot will be purchased in towards the end of the day to match the opening price on Monday as closely as possible. Big guys are going to want a ‚Äúgood‚Äù price. Wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if one way or the other the closing price is right at/below $600 EOW. The question is how it will get there.

Just by not buying FDs, you've increased your odds of winning by a lot. And by mostly trading shares, even higher. 

Whether or not you'll still lose money depends on how you decide on when to enter and exit.

Good sir have you seen the date on that article ?
cathie gilf mama
I've heard it's fine, but just had sooooo much hype.
Where to start?  All the class action lawsuits and those brought by States Attorneys General. Or the god-awful reputation. Or integrating a streamlined Broomfield, CO company with a legacy Louisiana swamp phone company.  Or that they operate a bunch of legacy telco services that would take more money than its worth to upgrade, some of which the Feds won't even let them do.  Or that they've tried to generate new revenue stream through things like Prism TV, which failed miserably. Or data centers, which they had to spin back out.  Or network services - and which masochist would outsource network operations to the goddamn phone company.  

I don't know what the right move is.  And maybe Jeff Storey does.  But I sure as shit haven't seen it yet.

I only trade TSLA. Literally my only ticker.

This shut down comes starting the 24th, which means it comes after the 4Q delivery rush, and only impacts two lines that accounted for 15k deliveries this year. Those lines haven‚Äôt been refreshed in nearly 2 years while both the 3 and the Y have. It has been speculated on for about a year now. The amount of ridiculously moronic misinformation I read on TSLA is... well... expected around here I guess.

In short, enjoy continuing to be wrong and losing money.
Sorry to hear that may you find happiness in the great memories you had together.

>Keep portfolio 10% options or less, the rest shares

>Don't buy FDs. Buy 20-30 days to expiry, minimum

>Cut my losses at ~40-50% instead of letting everything expire worthless

>Stop trading options for the month if I've lost a certain percent in a certain timeframe

>it‚Äôs replaced hotels

I wouldn‚Äôt take it that far. I think they‚Äôre better if you‚Äôre traveling with a larger group, or if you just wish to stay some where more scenic. If you want to take a regular vacation to a nice tourist area, or just need a place to bring back your hooker, hotels are still, and will be the way to go for a very long time. 

However ABNB deciding to buy their own properties is a step in the right direction. But let‚Äôs not underestimate the extremely large market share that major hotel chains still have, and the benefits they offer guests. Even smaller brands or individual hotels, in the right location do fairly well. 

I think AirBNB for the foreseeable future has obtained and been the best at occupying a certain niche in the travel and hospitality industry but that‚Äôs all it is a niche, which isn‚Äôt a bad thing. It‚Äôs just not competitive to the other standard options imo. 

AirBNB has not replaced hotels, it‚Äôs made certain kinds of rental properties more accessible to the public.

I am in on 60 12 dollar Jan, and 50 Jan 13 Calls and I hope that they print, but in this market, where everything is overvalued (like SBUX), this rising tide should lift this shitty ship.

Well in all fairness the sub has probably turned over its user base 2 or 3 times since then.  Like the March crash probably blew up half the sub, the recovery brought in a whole new set that got blew up during the sharp recovery with their puts.  Then that group got blew up the first two weeks of June.  

Then we had the culling from PRPL and more recently the culling from PLTR.

I‚Äôve just recently had an argument with a boomer at work about this as well. He thinks shares like Tesla are gonna crash any day now and thinks that I should talk to his financial broker so that I can earn like 10 to 12 percent a year while they get a small cut.

Oh yes ... I'm sure THIS will be the week PLTR recovers ... the desperation is starting to smell
Well, you add $11.50 to exercise a warrant so if you add $11.50 to say a $3 warrant, that's $14.50. So if a SPAC is trading at $12, it means the warrant is a bit high. I could be totally wrong in that, but that's what I've learned thus far. Doesn't mean it's a terrible entry point. But if you plan on buying say 200+ and it drops $1 or $1.50, you can start to lose a bit. If you believe in the SPAC, go for it.
You could afford PLTR calls but not a 6200 surgery?
Why do people have kids out of wedlock or when they can‚Äôt afford them??
You think? Sounds smart, I could see that totally happening. I‚Äôve lost money betting against tesla, always makes me nervous. But I do believe it has a ways to fall.

READ THIS

I‚Äôve been waiting to see something like this again. I was hacked a while back. Woke up from a nap to the notifications that all my holdings were being sold and then withdrawn through the debit card that I never signed up for. Yes, they put you in line automatically, that‚Äôs what they did to me. OH AND DID I MENTION THAT 2FA DOESNT SAVE YOU? I posted what had happened to this sub and Robinhood sub and got laughed at. I wish someone would have comment this kind of message instead. Think about how popular Robinhood is, now think about all the money totaled from Robinhood users. Now if I were a hacker, I‚Äôd look where money is most stupid and vulnerable.

I got raw dogged by some cut in NY and another in France. Once I saw the withdrawn statements or whatever they‚Äôre called on your images, I got PTSD of that pain. 

Robinhood will replace your amounts and holdings BUT NOT WHEN YOU GOT IN. As in your cost basis will be when THEY replace you, NOT WHEN YOU ACTUALLY GOT IN. Can they do something about that? Yes. Will they? Probably not, they didn‚Äôt for me.

I learned my lesson hard and fought back and forth with them but I already had them transfer papers ready to go. I did so. 

And yes, I wish I would‚Äôve seen just how red that flag was that RH only does email customer support

If you have any other questions, I‚Äôd be happy to answer

Don‚Äôt the bigger institutional owners typically side with incumbent management, however if the slightly smaller shareholders call in their shares the larger institutional owners may have a lot less of the outstanding shares.

If there are 140k long and 70k short, the first 39k that call in their shares for the consent make up the majority needed, i.e. 39k of a maximum 76k outstanding (i.e. 69k current outstanding plus say another 7m additional shares the company could sell under the shelf). The borrow rate for lent out shares is already around 70% suggesting something behind the scenes is happening.

No they are fucked from a production standpoint. This email was leaked today.

‚ÄúTo ensure that we have the best possible outcome and earn the trust of the customers and investors who have placed their faith and hard-earned money with us, we need to increase production for the remainder of this quarter as much as possible.‚Äù

Yes üôè
Yeah the valuation right now is all because of Elon and his many many fans. If Elon decided to focus on SpaceX and the Boring Company and let somebody else take charge of Tesla it would absolutely plummet. 

Not because the company is worse off without him, they're already barely profitable. It's just because the power of his influence is so strong.

Without the tax incentives to buy EVs, and the Carbon credits the government allows them to sell, they'd still be losing money even now.
Don't let the media and socialist get to you with that white guilt shit

God Forbid that people start dying from this vaccine, how bad will the crash be ?
When the company / business model is structurally flawed it's called a value trap. 

GME is 100% a trading phenomena. The result of a boom in options trading, zero commission trades and deep OTM calls bought by people who have no idea what they're doing.

That said, it could go higher still but the clock is ticking down.
Tech startups are rushing to IPO right now. Like you said, they are only investments for the people that sell right before the bubble pops.  Either way, should be good content for this sub!
Tesla would only crash like that if it was revealed that there is nothing special about its technology or engineering. But I think we all believe its got some special sauce. And we've seen Musk do miracles with SpaceX, so the halo effect from that carries over to Tesla.

how do you fuck up credit spreads that badly and consistently mate...

TBH I'm just another idiot here but lately it's been okay by selling either credit spreads or iron condors AFTER a stock moves by a lot (2-5%) in a day and begins to flatten out. Usually there's overreaction to news that isn't that bad or that good, IV goes down, people get used to the new price, 90% of the time it moves in the opposite direction of the earlier move by a little bit and consolidates unless its a /r/wsb meme stock or some biotech thing or the news is actually bankruptcy level burn it all down etc etc.

Also lately, getting premium ideally like 40-50% of the size of the spread/condor and only bet like only 10-15% of your account at a time... it'll work. And no long term credit options lmao just weeklies or 2 weeks out to capitalize on the most theta decay. who would pass up a play that very likely gets you 40-50% return that week with low chances of a -50% rock bottom max loss

Pay your rent put more money in credit spreads & don't fuck it up this time

Tesla 900 eoy
a buying opportunity
As long as people are willing to accept stock as payment and shareholders keep cumming in their undies every time they decide to dilute the shares.

If Tesla crashed tomorrow back to its pre-split levels it would be pretty fucked. People would be much less likely to accept stock as payment.

No. The recession and consequently reaganomics was a result of full employment policy and unions being too strong , running up inflation by running up the cost of labor. Then the oil crisis made things worse. So then reaganomics stepped in to control inflation and start supply side economics.

Completely random, but does anyone else remember when Venezuela was supposedly on the verge of catastrophe?

Thanks. Buying calls.
Sitting in cash.  This is strictly day trading.
what happened?
I'm poor so I need growth to fund dividend stocks for any consequential or livable income. I chose gold instead of bonds. That includes growth stocks as well as a gold pen and a tiny coin. If I get growth from my small caps then I can get more small caps and put a portion into those blue chips. Value and volatility for a while. I found a Turkish bond that paid 14%. Somewhere along the line I decided to invest more in Canada. We have water, gold, resources, everything. We have our tech giant, BlackBerry. Point me to the worth while bonds, for I have not seen any.
Branson unmasks and it's actually Trevor Milton the whole time. Just planned to drop the space craft down in the first place.

I feel like most of the initial retard energy is already spent. You're going to have at least a couple of months to buy the dips at your leisure.

I bought at $15 and am planning for a ten-bagger over the next half-decade or so.
Jfc, I‚Äôm saying are you shorting the stock or buying puts, because your obviously bearish on it
I mean that‚Äôs literally the effect of cheap and assessable credit doing its thing. I know a lot of people use it as a way to pay their credit card debts or just debts in general. Capital one has already banned ‚Äúbuy now and pay later‚Äù as the way to repay debt and I think soon many banks will follow as well.
I would like to see the puts at 350 instead of 335 but I like the idea!

This guy fucks.
The funny part of this is that, we're comparing GME revenue at the end of a console cycle. When new game consoles get released everyone who planned to purchase PS or Xbox will hold off their purchases and even more so the closer we get to release date, so revenue is expected to suck. You just compared gamestop's worst revenue to DoorDash's best of time. 

Everytime someone tells me GME is going to 0 due to their declining revenues, I just :shy: emoji about how retarded they are like how Ryan Cohen did on his twitter. Ok Boomer.

**Here a quick DD: Selling credit spread is the #1 strategy you could deploy right about now...Most stocks are already priced in for the next several earnings  (3-5 quarters). So there is a higher probability of stocks moving either sideways or even pulling back this year. Hence, no better time to sell those call credit spreads to reap in some juicy premiums !!!**

You lost me at volatility and proved you‚Äôre a con man at higher returns. You‚Äôre boldfaced lying. Anyone with basic insight into investing knows the SP500 outperforms a bond allocation. Whatever ‚Äòchart‚Äô you just threw out there is 100% bullshit and can be disproven in moments:  https://www.marketwatch.com/lazyportfolio. 

Not to mention people are paying fees which takes a staggering toll on their total returns. Plus volatility has absolutely no bearing on returns‚Äîactually, no, they‚Äôre a positive, because you can buy at discount. 

People like you are disgusting. You‚Äôre either too dumb to know what you‚Äôre doing is horseshit or the snake you probably are.

Short selling creates synthetic longs. If someone owns a share, and they lend it to be shorted, and someone buys the short, there are two long positions on one share.

Where you personally buy things is less relevant than consumer surveys that show Gamestop holding up remarkably in mindshare and purchasing intention. Gamestop was the fourth most likely place for customers to holiday shop, after Walmart, Target, Amazon, dollar stores, and *ahead of* Best Buy.

this kind of thinking is what loses you money.  You need to realize that the market is now moved by autists....just look at tsla.  Autists buy irrationally and on late news.

If an idiot is telling you to buy - and they are planning on buying - then you should buy - just get out before other people do.

this is what i was referring to btw
Suppose you want to play on : 

Ladbrokes 

Will hill 

Bet 365 

All at the same time.

You notice 

The money line for Chelsea v Manchester let‚Äôs say: 

Team 1 is +150 on Bet365 
But line for team 1 is +175  on WillHill 

Which sportsbook would you rather wager on? Now of course in a perfect market every site will have exact same lines; but a bookmaker needs to hedge the bets such that they make money either way and doesn‚Äôt see a net loss. (Hence why some bets are limited). 

Of course the obvious is to bet on WillHill. 

Now what paysafe- Skrill does is allow you to move money quickly between bookies 1,2,3. 

Sometimes if you‚Äôre lucky an arbitrage opportunity could exist such that you essentially win $$ regardless. (Google sports betting arbitrage). 

Now with a bank it‚Äôs quite slow I‚Äôm not sure how long it takes for you, but for me lines move quick and transfers take 3-5business days if I‚Äôm lucky. 

PayPal is ~ $5,500 max and 1 working day on WillHill, Ladbrokes and 365. 

Depending on how you gamble that can be only 10 units. 

I used to transact probably neighboring on $250k /month worth of volume between sites in 2012-2014 and Skrill always offered the quickest and maximum amounts. Again, I go where games are and if lines are good. Bet365 was notorious for their juice but only place that offered live-betting. Generally I stayed with 5dimes / pinnacle as their juice was 105 

Not sure if PayPal has any limitations being in Canada PayPal would not process for me; and bank-wires take infinite amount of time. 

PayPal was also a pain for me to hold multiple currencies without getting destroyed. 

This gets slightly more complex as PayPal works with just Ireland & UK.  Now what if you‚Äôre in Germany instead? 

I‚Äôm not too familiar as I‚Äôm retired now so haven‚Äôt been in this for few years perhaps you could update me on if PayPal still have their similarly small limits and country restrictions & currency issues ?

Make the move now you could get a multi year lease for cheap + some free months. I have some friends there and rent is low from what they tell me.
Look at the 5 years chart.

Stay  away from this stock.   It's a dividend trap.   What good is dividend  when the price keep dropping and you lose more in principal

If  you hold call, it's even worse.    Your options are going down from the  price decay from unsustainable dividend payout, but you DON'T even get the dividend.   LOL.

There is a reason why LEAP call are so cheap.

I just raised this point a moment ago and got some fairly rational answers about the bagholders from pre-earnings still trying to raise the price. Also subsequently found this;

"Sales have declined from $9.5 billion in fiscal year 2011 (before the last console cycle) to $6.4 billion in fiscal year 2019; EBITDA has dropped from $839 million in 2011 to only $111 million in 2019; net income has fallen from $339 million in 2011 to a loss of $470 million in 2019; and in the two most recent quarters alone, the company lost another $277 million. All of this happened while the size of the global gaming market has grown by more than 2.5x since the last console cycle."

...TO THE MOON ????
unless the problem was something incredibly simple like they forgot to plug the fucking engine in (not a real suggestion btw), i don't think they're going to fly for at least a month.

In any other state, I'd agree, but California has unique features that make it always-in-demand.  Just look at the weather, the natural beauty, and all the recreational activities these bring.  New people are constantly coming here from all over the world, and major catastrophes like the Northridge Earthquake only slow the phenomenon.

So, I agree that CA is on a downward trend at the moment, but it won't last forever.  The fundamentals are too strong

I mean its funny until the effects play out.

Rich people looking around and moving to another state seems funny at first, until you realize they took jobs, payroll, income, and all sorts of other taxes along with them.

I know plenty of restaurant/other SMB owners in my state who are looking around and saying "meh, will take a few years to get up and running again. Might as well retire early" and are calling it donezo about 7-10 years earlier than expected.

Just a few SMB's I can name account for probably 100 jobs + associated taxes + expenses, not even considering indirect jobs.


Good luck fixing a homeless problem when there are no rich people to tax.

And to be clear, [California knows this was already happening BEFORE their strict COVID measures](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwood/2019/12/03/leave-california-keep-paying-california-taxesreally/?sh=3bec369b4042).

Reddit is normieville at this point.

Every sell has a corresponding buy. That's how the stock market works. Someone is closing a short or opening a long on 100% of every single transaction.

Gamestop offers 0 compelling case to go long for anything other than a quick trade right now. Literally nothing. It's a dinosaur business trying to compete in the e-commerce space against giants like walmart and Amazon...offering only gaming supplies.

I already shop on Amazon. I have Amazon prime. Why in the fuck would gamestop ever pop into my mind when making a gaming purchase?

There's not many eager buyers. You have literally 0 clarity on how long those short positions have been open. It's pretty damn easy to short it on strength and close it on weakeness. 

It's maybe undervalued compared to revenue compared to other stocks, but who the fuck in their right mind wants to be long gamestop after that shitty earnings? What the fuck does gamestop offer that actually warrants a higher multiple?

If I'm building a portfolio, why the fuck would I want a company that is: losing money, closing stores, on a downtrend if you zoom out, losing market share, filed to dilute their own stock a week ago?

Of course GME doesn't deserve a valuation of 100 billion.  It is a company that was in the gutter a year ago, and is steadily turning the ship around.  They've shown solid improvements over that time and will continue to do so.  That includes expanding into new product offerings, massive increases in online sales and a huge reduction in debt - during a pandemic mind you.  When most non tech companies have been loading the fuck up on debt

And the stock price itself is held down by the massive short interest. Were they gone, it would probably be trading in the 20s just from that.  70 million sells with no corresponding buys

Market dynamics. GME is not going bankrupt, yet 70 million shares were sold short assuming that would happen. The shorts are paying high fees to maintain a position that has broken their thesis. 70m buyers that you get to front-run.

I subscribe to the fact that GME is undervalued and this is an added benefit.

Leverage and the inability to sell covered calls on fractional shares. As a retail investor/trader, with 25k, would i rather have 8 shares on Amazon with no ability to sell options against my shares or 117 shares of Microsoft and sell weekly/monthlies for extra income?

The call is obvious. 

Now after a 15-1 split, would i want 120 shares of Amazon or 117 shares of Microsoft, both giving me close to the same leverage, on a blue chip stock, and the ability to sell calls against my shares? 
The accessibility to retail makes buying Amazon more enticing where as now its a no brainier going with Microsoft, or Alibaba, or another comparable stock.

None.  Everyone went full retard for it a few weeks ago, logically thinking that Black Friday / Cyber Monday sales would make it pump.  Instead, GME issued a report indicating they had slow sales, they are closing more stores, and their company is on borrowed time.

Yeah those were perhaps a bit risky, what strike? If 270 strike you might do ok, if higher I would be worried.

I had planned on holding through January but might exit some of my calls if we hit 280 before then to reduce my exposure somewhat.

They still offer quite a bit of leverage, while also partially protecting you from any market downturns (because you will have time for the underlying to recover before expiry). 

I frequently buy options in the 3-6 month range, but I have been holding on to a LEAP in RTX for a while. Probably going to hit about 200% return on that (so 200% return over about a year on that investment).
Honestly you should probably sell everything you own first to boost that capital.

Lol so if anything happens, people who are holding calls through the weekend will benefit. But In WSB fashion, basically going to buy FDs as soon as it gaps up 15% and get the big red dildo.
I took 1/2023 30c on PLTR. Strike was basically ATM when I bought it but it was an expensive premium. Break even is $44. Downside is that that capital is tied up until it prints and I sell.
What's the general consensus? Is this a Buy for next week? I usually like to buy for LONG-TERM Hold
Taking a time out myself. Nearly 50% in cash. Made 8% YTD w a conservative portfolio. Two market corrections of 20% or more in past 2 years, there will be a better time to buy. Also Fed does not control long end of curve. Tech stocks with low or no earnings will be crushed when the 10 year yield goes up another 10 to 25 bp.
NVAX is the better play. It‚Äôs going to be a printer in a couple of weeks when they announce Phase 3 results. Prelim results showed the highest antibody titers of any vaccine. Also unlike Pfe, you can store their vaccine in the fridge with your beer, Pfe/BNTX need to be stored  at a temp colder than Antarctica

Just a heads up, GME will not short squeeze unless they do some kind of tender offer. Maybe they get an outsized jump on a profitable quarter but you will absolutely not see it go from 13 to 50 overnight.

Too many traders, nobody actually wants a long GME position.

There's a lot more to financial planning than investments, and there's a lot more to investing than buying and holding SPY. For example, you'll have less volatility and more returns if you have proper asset allocation. [Chart](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/soLY5kWqBI9OyRZ4FBLu4XW68gP9PD2W2NrBB9I1p_p5no21NhIOnzIJhvEOKr3oDlh6oM20DpnotODW0czyR3CVzS-r2j0RpGuBrntrhZbURnLaXQBxqLB31k-TgDi9KjkhgFNILmaJaqth2tT_85BgnhQIU6F7FC8nvHyskgAKiHsg)

I think some of the best work I do has nothing to do with stocks, namely educating people about budgeting, cash flow, and other basic financial literacy topics.

But there's also estate planning, insurance planning (I don't sell insurance, but I can recommend what to get), tax planning, retirement planning, education planning, etc.

Not everybody needs or wants a financial planner. That's fine. Some people are comfortable doing it themselves, or are uncomfortable letting others do it. But yes I'm absolutely in it to help people. I could make way way more money selling insurance.

Also, I didn't say philanthropy. Philanthropy is the volunteer work I do with VITA and other pro-bono financial counseling services. I absolutely expect to be paid for my work, but I expect it to be fair, I expect the client to fully understand and agree with what they are paying for, and how much it costs, and I expect to be a fiduciary for the client.

Smart. What price
I am but I only have one share lol I had no faith
Yup. I'm sure the amount will decrease next year but hell it helps when you get double fica in the butt.

Also for doordash do people tip in app or hand you cash?
Been holding 6 12/18's for a month. Fingers crossed.
It's kinda like buying the stock at a cheaper price, but you have to sell at a certain date. A lot of people hedge it by selling weeklies or monthlies off of their LEAP. That play comes with its own risk of course.
Can people stop spamming the board with these posts
VIX looks primed for a little spike. VXX weeklies??
They need to try again, or else Kele will literally be tomorrow.

ok give me all your current positions plz. thanks dad
Honestly if it's just priced like logitech (CRSR should be more expensive than LOGI imo) then it should be trading at around 73 a share (if we apply a similar price to sales ratio to CRSR)
Not only that, but a lot of FAs provide guidance that doesn‚Äôt even pertain to securities. Many people are starved for financial planning- especially when it comes to retirement, tax efficiencies, charitable donations, estate planning, and just general guidance.
FNMA is a stock that Ackman is long on. It trades $2.90 on OTC now. If gov releases it and it goes back to NYSE, Ackman and others believe it automatically jumps to $10. Others say $40. Traded in $60 range before gov takeover. One of the most imp companies in real estate - the entire housing system's liquidity is provided by FNMA and FMCC.
Do you have anything better to do with the money held in margin by your broker and are you okay getting assigned? Because time is on your side right now so me personally I‚Äôd let it ride
SPCE needs to pump to 40 before new flight date is announced ,50 till the actual flight....retrace to 48 if they fail again....before rinse,repeat and hit 100.

200$ when they finally go to space

500$ when Branson gets ready to go to space

1000$ if he comes back alive...900$ if he dies but his body makes it back(okay joking).....space is hard but rewarding
fuck my first phone was with nextel when i was like 14, but i can't even remember what i had for breakfast two days ago

Probably that musk is too much of an egotist to let any of it go. he's been pulling a lot of cash out of tesla as of late too. IDK if he has to use it only for tesla but with the recent spaceship crash he could use PSTH for more upfront cash if he can't use Tesla's. Unfortunately, I think if SpaceX is its own public company it could sap away a lot of the tesla investors who think they're buying a piece of SpaceX via Tesla.

Because you have more time for the option to be ITM. Helps weather volatility so your position has more time to print. For example, I've got PLTR leaps because that shit is going to be hella volatile for a while but I believe it's going to go up long term.

My 365P printin'
Last year I got up to 666k and I felt on top of the moon. I was stuck in the 400s for the longest time. I‚Äôve put all my money into my brokerage account since high school (11 years ago) and I was used to slow gains. At 600k I was comfortable throwing around a few calls here and there. My 4K call on Shopify turned into 140k in a month and I‚Äôm now addicted to calls. I try to make sure my calls stick to under 5% of my net worth. 
It doesn‚Äôt hurt that my wife just become a doctor and I‚Äôm totally fine with being a stay at home dad if it goes tits up.

SpaceX, baybe.

You don't think TSLA is at 3k a share because of cars, do you?
IV pricing in an 8.5% move. so if it moves any less than that you lose money. earnings plays are generally not worth playing.
I got you, so far he is the goose who lays golden diarrhea
Yes
The beckys never stop.
?
Why? I just closed mine at a 70% loss on Friday
It makes all the fucking sense in the world. 

1) autards latch onto a stock with low options volume 

2) pump and hype stock to the moon with a group of 1 million plus other tism minded good folks

3) stock skyrocketed as algos try to balance against the tide

4) go to step 1

Repeat this cycle enough and several things happen: the ‚Äúsmall stock‚Äù becomes a large stock becomes an index becomes the market, the artists grow in number and expand their power, non-extrachromosomal traders join them because they can‚Äôt beat them.
That's serious too, it can lead to YOLOing SPY puts if left untreated.

Dude was always trading cigs on the side....hes feeling this down about 7k? What kind of peasantry is this.
Ya know, back in my early twenties I got divorced and my ex took everything. She put $1500 on a credit card and I was stuck with the debt while the only thing I had gotten using it was a pair of jeans. I wore those $1500 Levis for years. All said and done I was in debt for around $50,000 with literally absolutely nothing to show for it. Over the next few years I was collected on over and over. Taken to court where they added charges and fees and tripled what they were legally owed. Shit like an $11 bounced check for a pizza because that was the only way I could figure to get something to eat turned into $80.

I went fully frugal and religiously lived cash only. Never got a car loan or any credit cards. I'm 50 now. I have a few emergency cards that never get used and mortgage - but it's a frugal 15 year that is well within my means and will be paid off after a total of 10 years anyhow.

Point being learn from this. Change your ways. This too shall pass and you can come back better.

I'm too lazy to watch the video but it's called a doji candle because of the dojima rice exchange where the first futures were traded.

The chad trader in that exchange basically invented candlestick charts and TA. He used things like head and shoulders patterns back when literally nobody knew they existed to become one of the richest people.

You can read his book, it's called something ridiculous like the "three golden monkeys strategy" or something, but it's basically primordial TA, and it worked very well for him despite nobody else knowing it existed. So much for the self fulfilling prophecy argument.

The big one and the only one I‚Äôm gonna mention right now, which I can‚Äôt specifically call out without getting my post auto deleted in the sub. Digital (smart)contracts, currencies, and stores of wealth. (Wealth does not= currency) I have been bullish on these for a few years, but really ramped up this year. The US response this year has done nothing but accelerate the decline of the USD as the reserve currency of the world (where the dollar is the currency and the physical or virtual dollar bill is wealth).   
  
I‚Äôm looking forward to the disruption with smart contracts in the way of actual law, but also just simply business(consumer) contracts. One easy example, as a telecom customer, if my payment to my provider was dependent upon uptime, and the contract network detected that they could only ping my provider 98% of the time, they would get hit with a 10% deduction per percent of time, so something like 80% payment to incentivize them to fix their network.  
It would obviously be more complicated than that, but that would be one implementation.

Yes I read their explanation

But it doesn‚Äôt add up. If an IPO doesn‚Äôt pop the first day then the company gets a bit more money but everyone permanently calls their IPO a failure because it went down the first day.

Companies like Airbnb aren‚Äôt stupid and know they could have gotten more than $68 but they‚Äôre only selling a small percentage of their shares anyway and now they had a hugely successful IPO due to the pop. Even if it goes down a bit then it‚Äôs still a good IPO story.

If you IPO at twice the price then you need to be able to deliver. Airbnb can do that but it‚Äôs not clear Affirm is going to take over finance and support a doubled valuation  just cause they have a sweet deal with Peloton which is hot
That‚Äôs a weird interpretation of ‚Äúup‚Äù and down

Avg cost?? 

Lol it was a $10 SPAC that ran to $47 but okay.

Im strictly using metrics to value this company. It has a 2.5b addressable MARKET OPPORTUNITY in 2025, and that is if it claims the whole LIDAR sector which it won‚Äôt. Its market cap rn is approx 12-13b. A bunch of fucking retards see 1.6b market cap on robinhood and think that is their entire market cap. That is only the 13% of public shares available so you‚Äôre not including institutional holdings, warrants, other private investors. For a 13b company that has a market opportunity of 2.5b.. yeah right. Also they only did 15M in revenue last quarter. Look at VLDR, 4b total market cap with way more revenue (100M) and the clear leaders in Lidar sector. Overvalued af. Fair value is 12-15.
I know nothing of this company except they are century link and that they have Burry behind.

Once I saw calls were dirt cheap I bought some calls just in case

If you look at full content that they own for streaming, $T is probably better off than Disney right now simply due to how the adult content is shunted off to Hulu in the US.  If you don‚Äôt have kids, Disney + itself is pretty weak especially compared to the catalog that $T carries with HBO alone.  There is more than enough room for both to thrive, especially in a cord cutting environment.  

Netflix is absolutely the one in the most danger simply due to Amazon Prime streaming being more of an afterthought because of the free shipping.

The major tv networks have managed to coexist for a very long time and I expect the same will be true of streaming as well.  Instead of ABC, CBS, NBC.  It will be Disney+ and Hulu / HBO Max / Netflix.  Peacock and CBS discovery are the two that I expect to be the first casualties of the streaming wars with one of the above mentioned cannabilizing their content.

I was in the military so I don‚Äôt know about the local job market personally. But most of the people I know working non government jobs seem to like it. Although it‚Äôs not as easy to move up as it is in the states. College students love studying there because it‚Äôs a nonstop party.

The older people are generally the only ones who won‚Äôt speak good English but I‚Äôve never had anyone be rude. I‚Äôd definitely give it a try especially if you can move to Seoul or Busan. It‚Äôs a fun place to live, but very expensive for housing. My in laws just closed on an apartment near Gangnam in Seoul at it was insane how much it cost for just an apartment.

Yup so true. People don't realize how big the global housing market is. Even with the IPO pop, Airbnb could easily be a 5-10x still as it grows into its market cap.
But did u really say it tho? U said biiiiiiiitch?

Bb pls
It's a great stock to short! I'm a little late but I'm gong to start a small position on Monday.
hey thank you for the kind words redditor. yeah options gambling is dangerous and causes depression through greed and chasing. 

Indeed - i have issues with almost every company's valuation, basically the entire market. All PS, PE ratios are so overvalued. Like SNOW's market cap being larger than the entire industries. I like what PLTR, MRNA, NVAX are doing, but all of their valuations are ridiculous.

I kept feeling morally wrong to be buying calls, but it's what's needed - so I was just buying puts all of this year and watching them vaporize to nothing.

The only thing that's "right" in this game is making money
Guess who has the most money? Rug pull will be a sight to see

Monday: ____ down PM, just shaking out weak hands, it‚Äôll shoot up. Not sweating. 

Tuesday: up a few grand but ‚Äúit‚Äôll keep going, if I sell now I‚Äôll loose out on a lot of coinage‚Äù as my wife is asking why I‚Äôm not cashing out. 

Wednesday: hmm, should‚Äôve sold yesterday but I can just feel that it‚Äôll go back up. *Constantly  checks WSB and Stocktwits for confirmation bias* 

Thursday: someone posted some shitty DD last night but it aligns with my thoughts, I‚Äôll be up bigly tomorrow if not this afternoon. 

Friday: I‚Äôve still got a few hours even though it‚Äôs down. I sell now and it‚Äôll shoot up so I‚Äôll keep holding. *Expires worthless*

I mean go for it. It's basically buying a lottery ticket. If you happen to pick the next TSLA, you'll be rich. Otherwise you'll lose whatever you put in. It's pretty much an all or nothing type play. I might try a couple of them just because why the fuck not. You're very very likely to lose your initial investment though.

I don‚Äôt live there at the moment. We are in school here in Irvine. But I lived there a year no problem. In Seoul everyone speaks English and there English translations on literally every sign. It‚Äôs too easy. Unlike Japan where you‚Äôre kinda fucked.

And even in the city I lived, Daegu, it was the same way. You don‚Äôt have any problems with people not liking you and I‚Äôve never had problems with a language barrier. Worst case I just point at the menu.
Is there any catalyst that we‚Äôre looking at for 12/18? Why not further expirations is my question
Why no GNUS?
You‚Äôre on wsb retard.
There is actually solid science behind selling random otm options (short term), the more diversification the better as long as the option chains are atleast somewhat liquid. Basically random ticker, random call/put if you want to stay neutral. If you write (sell to open) these, you have a positive gain expectancy. If you buy random short term otm options and you would simulate it with this tool (hold to expiry), the result would always be the same: your account goes to zero. The only difference will be the time to get there from simulation to simulation. Basically this seems to sum up the WSB experience buying FD scratchers.

It follows that in order to be a successful trader long otm options, you need to be better than throwing darts. Very few option traders are better than that over a time horizon, of say, 10 years.

I intend to unload them before March.  I would be Ok ?
Yeah they took an overreaction hit, exasperated probably cause 5G area sank cause of qc0m getting attacked, because of their caution to investors theyre taking a 117M hit. But they're renewing a deal worth at least twice that with Apple. They learned that they have to beat earnings no matter what, even if over caution hits their stock price. What happened to nokia post their last ER substantiates that.

Should be a nice 10-15% step up. Also I think we get news on last Tuesdays c band auction on Monday, so im hoping both companies will get a nice boost. And possibly save my -85% jan $13 calls. Not averaging down if they're more than .15 but I will be buying July 11C for er!c.

Edit: if you're talking about nokia calls being dirt cheap remember to give yourself extra time and buy calls under 5 strike and be prepared to average down. Nokia is too uncertain for me to bother paying for deep ITM. Rather just lose all on 4C 2022 for higher upside.

Anyone whose calls for SPCE are dead because of the cancellation are idiots. After it first went up earlier this year, the obvious move is leaps or shares.  So evident after SpaceX made it go down and if you are buying weeklies still with that shit, you deserve to lose money.

Stocks traded in fractions and had larger spreads between bid and ask, we would get conservative and error on the side of caution but it was easy to get into an exchange call situation during fast markets. Then you would call the customer and say you either bring me a check before market close or we start selling LIFO to cover the call. It was chaos but fun.
I am somewhat weary of this data collection. How do we know it's not nefarious?

A few things. First of all you're "seeing" the one out of one hundred people that actually get lucky and scale up that much or are just lying. Secondly most people on here are like 18-30. Thats not the demo that has collected 1 mil+ in capital. Lastly, it is much much easier to buy 5k or even 100k worth of options on one single stock/expiry. If you have 5 million dollars you wouldn't be able to purchase enough contracts to get even half your order filled. And out of the finite number of people with 5 mil+ only a handful would be insane enough to essentially put it all on red and spin the wheel.

I actually have no idea what you are asking.  
I sold (to open) a Cash-Secured Put, which is different from a covered call. You get the shares from a CSP when the option expires ITM. You can exercise an option if you BOUGHT it, not if you sold it.  
Shorting does not involve options.

I think this is a great play. These people don‚Äôt know what their talking about. With the first vaccine being distributed in the u.s. travel stocks will get the rotation on Monday imo.

I wouldn‚Äôt touch this with a 10 foot pole - a lot of people I know are certain this is going to change the landscape of travel in the future and have put a lot of faith and money into this... at this rate, I believe someone else will swoop in and take over.

This comment was a super interesting read! And yes I agree; in theory it‚Äôs a cyclical loan process where the FED is ‚Äòinvesting‚Äô in market health, and an ROI is occurring with the lending facilities. 

In practice, however, witb the market so disconnected from economy due to a serious jobs problem, the FED is in all likely just stimulating stocks and the market but not the economy itself. The lending tools are protecting 401k‚Äôs and investment vehicles, but not actually helping the economy unless you believe in a very, very loose theory of trickle down economics

RKT needs to get back into the 30's where it belongs
I've been playing the past 6 setups, with 4 wins and 2 losses. One of those losses was my own mistake for not doing research about early lockup period. The other loss was a -3% loss. The wins have been 33, 28, 14, 14, 7, 169, and 34%, which should be higher but I cashed out early on a lot of short positions since I didn't think I could time the bottom.

I see nothing wrong with a basically 80% win strategy - I'm poor but made 1.3K so far in less than 2 weeks

I agree, 29 is just the *start* and I think it could at least test ATHs. If it broke out of both areas, I would add 2x, but 1/2 at each. Very speculative for my time frame so I would rather scale in this one.
Fuck. I thought I had it bad. I got almost 800, but only 25k worth expire this month. Well, 25k before today, anyway. I think I'll be mostly ok when it does eventually fly in the next week or two. Even if it does hurt today. And his are way up there, too. Holy Fuckballs.
I‚Äôm sitting on a fuck ton of VALE calls. Basically a yolod amount. Put $4k into VALE 2022 $20 calls.

for some reason every single person keeps saying this. if you are buying shares only, sure, by all means do robinhood. if you are doing options, the lowest price graduation of an option contract comes out to $1 ($0.01/share), so basically, if you can get a fill at 1 penny less on someone else, RH comes out to be shit.

AMZN can go on massive tear downs and destroy your strike prices, so you should be careful. I tried selling Credit Put Spreads once, and after that bad experience, like the many that you have had, I switched to straight scalping calls.
No your shares get assigned when the covered call expires or if the call owner exercised it early after reaching the strike price. At any time you can buy to close your covered call and sell a new one and that is basically rolling out.

Institutions seem to love this thing, and they aren't going to be pushed to sell since many of them got in at a super low price (120 for Buffett...).

My argument is not for calls, but rather for puts not printing.  I don't think there will be a big drop post 25% lockup ending.

Why would you play theta gang on something  that can likely swing 50% in either direction on a given week? Obviously it's dropping huge on Monday but from there it could be a continued spiral for weeks or could bounce hard off a super low price and double up from bottom easily. If anything buy monthly calls and puts and try to triple up on one then try to make something on the other in the same window. This thing aint gonna sit still.

Well, I‚Äôm guessing Giant -190,000 red dildo up his ass on Monday.
This is a true story.

In August I was down 70% all time, I quit the stock market cause I felt I was about to lose it all and I have no income do to corona. My cat ate some shit and needed an expensive ass surgery to get it out of his intestines or he would slowly starve to death, so I said fuck it and put the rest of my money into tesla weeklies before the split. Fuck yeah was all the way back up to 100%+ and kitty was saved.

Fast forward to November. After some terribly timed Sony calls (right before the sept tech sell off, with short exp dates) and some other bad moves, I ended up being down 90fucking%. I was absolutely devastated didn't know what to do. So what happens? My little fucking retard starts puking up all his food again with the same exact symptoms as last time. Another surgery! While I'm at my absolute lowest with only a little savings and no job. Fuck it, time to get back in I'm too far invested in the cat to lose him now. Go in one at a time on , KOS, PFE, APHA, PLTR, F, BABA, RKT calls and sell the moment I hit decent profit. Up 600% in one month and back to 100% all time.

I don't know if I saved my cat or if my cat saved me, but WSB was with me every step of the way. Cat's doing fine and I'm back in the game.

what‚Äôs wrong with having collateral
the problem is its not being counted as seasonal, so the number will continue to go up indefinitely. It will reach one million at one point because they never stop counting.

The way I look at covered calls is you have the risk of holding the shares, if it tanks to 0 your risk is higher than the person holding the call.
Yes it will I have the same 650C
[deleted]
Maybe maybe not
Seriously though when we mining on the moon tho üåö üåù
Please no
That‚Äôs the risk, you‚Äôre capping your potential gains. The potential gains can be substantial.

But covered calls are a generally safe strategy because in the scenario where you are called away, you‚Äôre still making money. Less risky than selling naked options.

That‚Äôd be all the publicly available float which represents the price of all the shares...(the price of the unavailable shares is equal to the price of the publicly available ones).

Every data set they are contracted to work with is different and will likely be requiring custom software to ingest it into their systems. It‚Äôs more similar to high powered consulting work from Mckinsey. i.e. not capable of rapid growth without significant head count which requires large salary costs.
Yea. You die and then youll be invulnerable to all deseases.

Calls 12/18 and 12/24
Anybody buying SNOW calls this week or for future months, can you tell me why? I have puts, trying to think outside my own bias.
Oh yes. You will be able to projectile vomit at superhuman velocities.
I‚Äôm actually blown away by how fucking dumb that was. He definitely belongs here.

or theyre just buying time for the vaccines to get delivered next week so they can cancel the stimulus on hopes of economic recovery
Yes and no. If you have a lot of money you can sell put or calls. they are profitable. if you have 1 or 200 dollars and your puts got exercised. you have to caugh up money to buy the stock.
Not for McDonald‚Äôs or fast food. I don‚Äôt think I ever had plates when I ordered food. During COVID they just dump it at your doorstep.
i think it might have something to do with smaller geographic area and more densely populated cities

CNK might actually be looking at scooping up AMC locations if they close any. 6 months and no buyer including DIS, AMZN has swooped in. All AMC has is investment firms who are offering liquidity, but their only hope is to declare bankruptcy and negotiate their debts similar to JC Penney.

If your not already in puts, we are likely through most vaccine pumps outside of JNJ and stimmy talks aren't going well. Even with all of this news there's a good chance AMC is going to be penny stock in three months without major developments.

The amount I make on the shares (despite them being worth similar $ values) is miniscule compared with the calls, I'm ok with the shares getting called away.  I'll either buy back in on the shares or just wait for the next correction.

I look for a nice price pop, then I sell the CCs at about a dollar above the current price.  The stock tends to trade in a range during consolidation periods - if I'm active, I'll wait for it to hit the bottom and buy them back sometimes so I can resell at the next run.
Close eyes. Pick red or green. Then pick the date that‚Äôs close to today. Hit the max button. Then wait.

Nope. I used to be worried about these too. Until I found out this is the standard procedure. All spac have to go through this before the merger. They check if all the sec process was followed.

**HAHAHAHA, FUNNY.** The green figure shows, yes, cumulative return. Not single-day return. You need to derive the fact not from the same larping OP, but from actually USING THE BROKERAGE, you retard. All I literally had to do to prove myself right is open up my Webull and check the account value based on the free stock they gave my ass. And, whattaya know?

**The free stock is worth 3 dollars. Net account value, 3 dollars.** Next to it? +50%, and +1.50 on all-time. So, you're gonna fucking say to my face that this stock went up 50% in one day? Well, let's see. Oh, wait. It barely fucking moved. Do you want to know why? **BECAUSE IT'S A FUCKING NET ACCOUNT VALUE.**

**AND BECAUSE IT SHOWS ALL-TIME, NOT SINGLE DAY. SO THIS MEANS OP WAS LYING. HE STARTED. WITH SIX. FUCKING. FIGURES. ON HIS ALL-TIME. NOT 12K.**

**All your fluffy bullshit on options expiration and the position he held, yet you're still getting one, fundamental thing wrong every single time.** And you're probably OP, just trying to defend himself and his larping. I'm telling you right now, your retardation knows no bounds. And you seriously can't admit you're wrong, you just keep digging a deeper hole with no understanding of brokerage interfaces, and you probably don't even trade. You seriously don't even know the degree to which people go to LARP on here. 

**Remember WSBGod?** How he spent fucking years making fake gains and photoshopping and even wrote a book and tried to profit from the sub turning it into a MLM scheme? You'd probably defend his ass to the death for every gains post his fake ass made. Fuck you, ultimate retard. And also, logically, how the fuck do you even operate? Are you this dense? When you're trying to prove a point, why do you cite the OP for evidence in his post history about having 12k? 

**Do you seriously not know how many people go to extents to justify their larping with years of prep, like WSBGod?** That's like if I asked for evidence on why religion is objective, and you cited a fucking Bible. You're so fucking retarded that you just made the spectrum larger. Retard. Go back into the retard hole you crawled out of. Before you reply, think about how retarded you are. And if you're still considering replying, think again. **Because you're fucking retarded.**

Before I'm downvoted let me start by saying I mostly agree with you on this.  However, a safe & successful abort is a positive in the safety column from my perspective. It would have been much better if they had set up a flight with the sole intention of going through an abort sequence, as this would have been seen as a success instead of a failure, but it does prove a safe abort regardless. Sadly I don't think the share price will reflect it as such.

He got paid a massive premium for them. This guy actually exploited a glitch with robinhood. You're not supposed to be able to make a trade where the credit is more than the collateral but he legged into the trade to avoid this. Also he made this trade where he's basically trading a box spread with one leg shifted over a strike to avoid it from being considered a box spread (since box spreads are banned on robinhood). This allowed him to make this ridiculous trade where his max loss is astronomically more than the money he started with. I'd have to do the math but I heard someone say the max loss due to assignment risk is over $500k. Looks like op finessed robinhood by exploiting this glitch, was able to exit for a profit before ever getting assigned, and made off with $16k profit. Beast move for sure. Worth the risk, probably not. Should he have ever been even allowed to open up such a trade in the first place? Fuck no. Robinhood is fucking retarded. They've been through this at least twice already, and lost a bunch of money off wsb users exploiting glitches. It's hilarious how retarded they can be.

Look up some vids on box spreads if you're curious about how these trades work.

This company is all hype. It has no revenue. The speculative play is that they'll one day be able to launch multiple flights a day. Theyve been at it for 16 years and still cant even match what the prototype did (2 successful suborbital flights in a week).

The price was running due to hype around testing. Even just a delay crashed shares by 10% this year. This is much worse. It means their engine is still crap after a decade plus of development. This test was make or break for the company and it failed. Im obviously guessing on the final opening price monday, but I expect a bloodbath. 40% sounds bad, but have to remember this stock was trading at $8 earlier this year. All the run up since then is hype that jyst got crushed. Instead of being weeks from faa approval its likely a year out at best now (and that assumes they actually get a successful test finally).
Imagine not using margin just bc you‚Äôre scared of a margin call

I think you should research and figure out these answers before you buy or make any big purchases. The details of every reverse merger is slightly different but you should check for binding agreements. Also Canoo isn't paying for the SPAC shares, I'm not in this play but in general it's the other way around (SPAC gets a small % of ownership in shares of the acquisition target in exchange for the public listing/cash to pay off maybe debts or make the deal more attractive). In general SPACs are just shells that allow a private company to become public without the official, usually lengthier IPO process. Market price has no impact on the acquisition deal pricing....

Calls on quality of life when you start tackling those tasks that you have been avoiding for ages. I got stuck holding the bags on my families trash pile. Parents/siblings are sorta hoarders, mom passed and the rest of the family moved across the country, leaving me with the kingdom of filth. Everything needs to be gone through, piece by piece. I wish I could throw it all out but its interlaced with personal information and sentimental things. Just one bin had bills from 1992, 1 ream of unused paper, old skateboard deck, tons of paperwork showing the entire families SSN, moldy stuffed animals, "lost" pictures. In total 80-100 boxes of various sizes reduced down to 6 bins. It took the wife and I 3 weeks but it's finally done, so many trips to the dump I lost count. Gained a basement and a spare bedroom, the latter of which will be rented as of 1/1/21. /end diary

Aw thanks! Yeah, internet discussions lack the nuance of talking face to face, so I feel like it's important to be extra polite and friendly, otherwise the whole thing quickly falls apart. Especially on a sub like this, hah.

Oh, and if you came here searching for info on $MFGP, personally I'm more than happy with the 65% return in 4 months and I'm (mostly) out of the stock now. Just my opinion, not professional advice etc. Were you able to make some money off of it?

A lot of conversations on AMC are about its financial situation. Which is fucking dire and bankruptcy is practically inevitable in 30 days. 

While I do think Cinemark isn't at nearly as much risk financially, they may be overlooked as a short opportunity because of its recent run up.

Keep an eye on CNK, the next year is going to be catastrophic still for theaters. They may never be the same with media consumption habits forever impacted and studios moving further away from theatrical releases.
I was about to tell him, then saw this.

Reddit itself has gone to shit and censorship. There's already multiple clones popping up. There's like 5 general reddit clones, another specifically for trump, another 3 specifically for gender criticals and women, 2 more just for memes, 1 for the incel/ugly community, etc. I'm actually surprised there's no clone for just WSB of all things, we could do pump and dump schemes or actually get DD done without living in a swath of retards.

If all tutes sold float would still only be 17 million. Most of them bought in the 40s and wont be dumping for a loss. Not to mention there have no institutions disposals since ipo. They have only been increasing their positions

I found some amazon on amazon for a reasonable price so I put some in my cart, but didn't buy because I didn't feel like it was the best deal. I hesitated and forgot about it for a week or two. Then I got on amazon again two days ago and the price had gone down 30%. I think the key is to put some amazon in the cart and leave it alone for a bit.

Couple things about this

Yes, small volumes of cash can move the ticker.  A couple weeks ago I placed a limit order for $1 above the current price for 20,000 shares.  They didn't fill for 3 minutes.  I got 15k then canceled the order.  I actually caused a mini spike in the price beyond my limit price after that

Another thing to think about is the lockup period ending soon

Did you not read the 60% tax thing he just wrote? It's not free, it's american bronze tier healthcare for double the price and huge waiting times. In america you pay like 200 a month for platinum tier healthcare covering like 100k a year. OR you go to the UK where everyone makes 40k a year which is less than alabama, you get taxed 50% of your paycheck and then they use 20% of the tax to give you 50 dollar a month american healthcare. They're literally robbing you blind retard, everyone knows free market healthcare is amazing. You idiots literally fly here for surgeries because your own countries LITERALLY LET YOU DIE INSTEAD OF TREATING YOU.

Positive mental attitude is that philosophy which asserts that having an optimistic disposition in every situation in one's life attracts positive changes and increases achievement. Adherents employ a state of mind that continues to seek, find and execute ways to win, or find a desirable outcome, regardless of the circumstances. This concept is the opposite of negativity, defeatism and hopelessness. Optimism and hope are vital to the development of PMA.

Thanks for this. Long time (5+ years) AMZN shareholde here, and I‚Äôve seen people crapping on AMZN since it was in 300s, up to 3000s.

That might not be a bad thing, though, because there are parts that have huge growth and major profit margins (e.g. AWS) and there are parts that are more of ‚Äúvalue‚Äù plays.

Yeah. I understand ya. I mean. IPO buyers will be selling if they were short term traders, but I think that only makes up small %. Many who got in at IPO got in cuz they want the next Google, Tesla, Amazon, etc. So yes, small % of traders who got in st IPO will sell and create that selling pressure. But I think most traders who have ABNB now got in at $140+ and I don‚Äôt think they‚Äôll sell at loss unless they are forced to
U get to deduCT the loss so if you've paid any tax like through collecting unemployment you should get a refund
Yeah I just think HD is a better play technical wise but both are good and move together really
Been thinking about ways to mitigate realized short term gains...

If you‚Äôre at all paranoid about more correction in the next couple weeks but still bullish overall, just hedge your shit with really short term OTM spy/qqq puts and/or vxx calls. Worst case you lose the premium and can deduct from your short term gains on the year and best case the hedge works and you limit losses or even make more gains.

We‚Äôll see what happens. I think that the ipo buyers are selling and it will create panic with the people who fomo‚Äôd in at $140+. In probably wrong, but I ain‚Äôt touching it at this price.

500k easy, they will likely exceed that number.

So the 18th they have to buy. [Disclaimer]What I'm about to say is all conjecture from what i understand. So from my research and understanding said research, they would be beyond idiotic to start buying in premarket hours. I think they will start dumping/adjusting their holdings of all other stocks then at 9:30 whej regular volume gets mov8ng theyll start to use algorithms to buy. Im 97% sure that the buying pressure on that day is going to far out strip selling pressure. Im hoping it peaks around noon or 1 pm. Also if yhe bidding price is too low they will logically have to bid it up, which means TSLA price goes up and that will happen on a loop (most likely) starting at 9:30. ..you know what im just going to make a post about this.lol

Pfizer and AstraZeneca won't move because of COVID vaccines in short term. They already got BDE.
Yes oh fuck yes you don‚Äôt see many great opportunities like these
> neither of us know whether the decision was to keep sales or grow them

Yeah we do, because if they had a waitlist a mile long as some people claim there would be no reason to cut prices until they could actually produce the market share they wanted to grab. Cutting prices by a massive amount when you already have more orders than you can produce and are barely profitable as a company would be incredibly stupid.

Unless you want to attribute some malicious intent like trying to stunt a competitor's orders even though you don't have the ability to produce those orders yourself.

>You initially claimed that cutting 25c per unit is a bad sign for Tesla‚Äôs future.

My initial ***statement*** was that I was weirded out by Musk talking about trying to find 25 cent savings while simultaneously cutting car prices by an absolutely massive amount - what you chose to read into situation is on you.
Buying Pfizer puts then. Medical emergency approvals never lead to anything but problems.

It won‚Äôt moon but it will increase to 50. The trend I‚Äôm seeing that affects our market the most is when the news has to do with us not other countries, yeah it‚Äôll increase with any positive news. But I feel it goes up or down the most when it comes to how it affects Americans.

I‚Äôve stayed in probably ten Airbnbs since I stayed in a Hilton, Hyatt, or Marriott. Those brands don‚Äôt even have that many hotels outside of the US except in a few major cities and islands, so their brands aren‚Äôt global in the same way. So of course Airbnb is worth more.

Yes they own the company once they exercise the shares in February or something. They want to make money off of it by raking in money from distributing the funds at probably a higher fee than ARK would otherwise pay on the open market. That‚Äôs their whole business as a fund distributor and since they own a majority share they want to make a lot of money here

Cathie runs the ETFs well and they probably thought she‚Äôd shut up and stay. But she did make a terrible business decision to give them control of most the company and at this point she would have to work for her enemy if she stays.

No I don‚Äôt think they believe they can run it better per se but they see opportunities to make more money off of it.

Depends. Alimony is typically only awarded if the spouse has no other income- i.e they weren‚Äôt working while you were married. It‚Äôs based on how long you were married as well as some other factors but if your wife is still working there‚Äôs a good chance that she won‚Äôt qualify for alimony. In that case marital assets would be split and you‚Äôd go your separate ways.
Ehh actually by looking at the chart if it can hold 220, I think calls here are good. Ill probably end up buying common instead of calls but Ill see. Im watching 220 closely

hypothetically if one starts this strategy today on SPY and SPY has another big meltdown like in march, then this could be a losing strategy because you are writing puts as the underlying decreases steadily. 

Could one use IV as an indicator to decide if you want to keep running the wheel? I am guessing you would add another function in PortfolioManager to check the IV and make sure it was below a certain threshold? any downsides to this other than potentially reducing gains?

Just went and did some reading about that.  It seems that‚Äôs true for 2 weeks.  

After two weeks the vaccine has had a chance to take hold and any Rona that may have been In your system prior to the vaccine will have had time to work its way out of your system, then you are good.
 \-10% is probably happening, unless they come out and say they will do another launch tomorrow and it goes well.

No I didn't.  


Some people invested through the NYSE, others invested through the London stock exchange, while others invested in Pfizer through the French stock exchange.  


So your argument here is pretty weak, and you're sounding kinda pathetic.  
The vaccine is American, because Pfizer is listed on the US stock exchange (among others)?  


Buddy, not everything has to be American.  
Not every Accomplishment has to be American.

Short term losses only cancel out short term gains before they will count against long term gains. Also $3000 in losses is deductible against income tax unless you're married filing separately, which is probably better than cancelling out long term cap gains taxes. Also idk what the deal is with carryover lossed and when it's a good time to carry over losses to count against next years $3000 and whatnot.

I never said it was a done deal but the facts make it pretty clear

What *is* a done deal is they have the right to own the company. So explain how Cathie is going to ‚Äúget rid‚Äù of the majority shareholder as you claimed lol. It‚Äôs impossible

Would you work for someone that took over your company by force after you told every reporter this was bad for ARK shareholders?
Elon said there would be a re-stock
you could get that same money through margin depending on how much house you plan on buying, margin interest rate is much lower with the risk of margin calls, so again it depends how expensive of a house you are buying. if say you have $2M and want a $500,000 house, then why not just buy the house outright and use margin and pay 1.59% interest rate on the $500,000? the risk of margin call is low if you are well diversified. and that 1.59% is completely tax deductible without itemization.
The SPCE move makes sense. She‚Äôs taking risk off the tables by taking profits after SPCE had a big rally. And it‚Äôs not guaranteed that the SPCE launch will go as planned. JPM is a low volatility long term investment. These moves make perfect sense. I think you are just browsing through WSB too much hahaha. ARK is a great longterm investment, although tesla is going to crash next month, so you should wait till then to buy ARKK because it‚Äôll be at a nice discount

NASA knows perfectly that a delayed experiment is better than a blown up experiment.

The flight windows goes till 24 December. So plenty of time for a second or third attempt.
It wouldn't surprise me if they made a second attempt on Sunday or Monday, thus demonstrating that they are totally capable of a rapid turnaround on flights.

I perfectly know that in the long run (4-10 years) they'll be old and definitely obsolete.  But I'm definitely in for some quick cash around 2021

You already chased it and bought the top yesterday. Don't make the same mistake. Lol. If it's way up at 4am Monday, it'll prob fade and dump at open and then up again. This was the pattern pretty much all last week. But then again it could just pump until later in the week.

Either way, it seems like anything under $20 is still a great entry. It'll likely see at least $40 on merger day.

Cutting 33% profit per unit is different than cutting 33% of their profit. Cutting profit per unit can increase total profit, through selling more units. This is the point I am trying to drive home. 

The conclusion of yours that I was referring to was when you said the decision was only ‚Äúto keep sales‚Äù because of a new competitor. Sure, the competitor probably had influence over the decision to drop the price, but neither of us know whether the decision was to keep sales or grow them. Frankly, that‚Äôs an entirely different argument than the one this started off with. 

You initially claimed that cutting 25c per unit is a bad sign for Tesla‚Äôs future. I will conclude with the fact that every automaker drives for these small gains.

The monetary base was increased by roughly 66% in a matter of months and they are talking about further stimulus, I don‚Äôt think we know all of the knock on effects that will come of it. We are used to measuring assets with the dollar measuring stick that we got used to over the past 10 years since GFC, but what happens when our measuring stick changes so much?

Yeah for sure I love swinging BIGC waiting for it to break out
I think the best bet is investing in the companies building these ecosystems that can compete at providing for a nation-state off data alone. That's going to be Tesla, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Google. Maybe Microsoft. Netflix is some tertiary bullshit that will be pumped in every biosphere but can't compete at the level. Same with Disney. It's the big data companies and the companies that will make the tools that gather that data that will be constructing the new future of monetization.
How does it feel to waste thousands of dollars every year doing one of the most disgusting habits out there?

I‚Äôm deep in PLTR and have to agree. I think the only major catalyst that will cause a huge run up is if they announce a large public sector contract.
Yeah just sell out! And then fomo back in when its near to the price target to see it reverse... THEN YOU COMPLAIN THE MARKETS HATE ME OOO THE MARKETS HATE ME. sell puts at 25 thank me later
I agree. Considering some of the euro poor countries and Canada have been getting 2000 a month, 4000 is nothing.

If anybody is actually interested in buying low and selling high and not buying high and selling higher

Take a look at the following and buy calls 4-5 months out on whichever stock you like the best.  Make sure to look at the chart and determine your stop losses and when you will abandon the play. 

Home Depot (HD) 

Best Buy (BBY)

McDonalds (MCD)

Salesforce (CRM) Think this actually goes a little lower in the future 

BigLots (BIG)

Tandem Diabetes (TNDM) My highest conviction play 

Inovalon (INOV) 

EXELIS (EXEL)

BigCommerce (BIGC)

Simulations Plus (SLP)

NO WEEKLIES, buy calls 4-5 months out on some of these names and track them daily. You will hit on 30-40% of the names and as long as you cut the losers when the lower end of support on the chart, your $$$$$ will increase as long as the market doesnt get blasted. If the market does get blasted but the stock is still consolidating, hold on to the calls.
If it expires next friday, its a weekly.

It's a bit of a shit situation: Mom runs a daycare from home. Dad has gotten Parkinson's and spinal cord injury on top of that. If shit goes worse with dad they have to move but that means the end of their income... on top of that selling the house would mean they have a huge chunk of money on the bank which means no government assistance and since my mom has her own company they get no pension. The tax on gifting or inheritance in this country is 10% which also sucks. Buying something is really difficult right now and renting is impossible since they both have no pension due to being selfemployed and nobody in this country will rent to you when your monthly income on paper is zero since it becomes almost impossible to remove them once money runs out due to housing laws. My brother and sister still live at home which adds to their income with the minor rent they pay. My brother is likely to live with them for long term, very high functioning autism but doesn't really give a shit about ever moving out because he kind of likes living at home. In theory they could roll like this forever as long as dad keeps doing a bit alright.

I filed for BK 2 years ago, I got two credit cards immediately after, a car a month after (not a great rate but not as bad a bad credit rate 6%) financed by a non-local lender. Now two years later my score is over 700 and I am in escrow to buy a house. 

If your life is in financial ruins it‚Äôs much easier to come back from a BK than it is to claw back from bad credit by paying things off.

It‚Äôs had its drawbacks but it‚Äôs been a net benefit and it‚Äôs not even close.

Edit: specific to this op tho if he is only 8k in debt he won‚Äôt even qualify for a BK, gotta pump those numbers up.

Bubble means something is overpriced. It means things are going up way too high, more than it's reasonably worth.

Riding the bubble up is great. But when it pops, everything's valuation goes down basically overnight and without warning. Depending on if you're bullish or bearish the pop is either terrible or wonderful. All about what position you take.
been thinking the same thing, I still feel like BFT has a LOT of room to run

Because their 401k gets fucked
Yes we do. Can confirm.
I'm starting to think TSLA will pump a little after inclusion (kinda like post-split) to bring in some new bagholders before seeing a more drastic correction like we did in September.
First off, SI is not the reason we are at the price today. Without shorts it would be much higher.

The longer this sits at anything above $0 is bad for shorts and more likely to cause them to capitulate on their bankruptcy thesis. As soon as a large short covers it could easily lead to forcing all of them cover.

She‚Äôs trying to replace them as the distributor to punish them for taking **majority control of the company** which means they can do anything they want once they take over in a couple months. So she‚Äôs probably trying to lock in some long term contracts with competitors to poison Resolute‚Äôs revenue stream before they take ARK over.

She‚Äôs doing it to say ‚Äúfuck you‚Äù before the own the place. That‚Äôs called burning bridges and it‚Äôs what you do right before you leave.

How did our economic system enable it?

It was funded 100% by the ''socialist euro paradise''. 100%.
Not a cent of funding from the US. All the labs, researchers, and technicians were European.

There was literally nothing American about this Vaccine, except that once upon a time the company existed in America.

It's good to be proud of your country, but claiming the accomplishments of others is pretty fucking sad.
üöÄ.
>Your conclusion would only be definite if the EV market was stagnant.

My conclusion was that if the industry was growing so fast and their sales numbers were as saturated as they claim they wouldn't have to cut 33% of their profit just because a competitor entered the field.
No taxes for 8.67 years: he can write off $3000 per year in stock market losses, whatever is over that amount goes to next year.

Where are you getting these statistics. The UN doesn't even have COVID numbers out. No one knows how many people it's going to kill, obviously, before the year is out and so none of the statistics I know of that are viable have any COVID in them. 

I don't even see how that would be logically possible unless you're saying that all the people who would have died of something else simply died of COVID instead.
Sex sells and we are living longer
Eh... probably not right now. Been dropping steadily for the past couple of weeks.
I took a few too many geltabs this week and had a vision of the future.

Instead of deciding to move from CA to Texas, people will decide whether to live with Google or Apple or Tesla. Corporations will compete to provide better and better lives for their customer-citizens. Even people who do nothing all day will be monetized. Facebook will be able to offer housing and make more off the data they get from people then those people could ever make working. They will reach tech and capital levels that allow them to monetize people better than people ever could themselves. Look at costs for space travel under NASA vs under SpaceX and you can see that gov'ts are just impeding our growth.

The government is a protection racket slowing the transition to corporatocracy, but one day we will reach such exponential levels of growth that it won't matter. Companies will compete for citizens like countries do. I can't see how this isn't inevitable, given enough time. It will start with free housing being monetized for data and then turn into some sort of cyberpunk matrix type future, where we are merely consumer batteries to help power the machines of capital. Investors will have so much capital that they will fall over themselves to give more and more away to retain consumers. The free market provides a fabulous future and we slowly extract the power from the sun with a Dyson sphere and then move on to the next star, likely without being impeded by our biology any longer.

tldr; QQQ 350c 6/11/21
You sir are a very dumb fuck. But we will pull you along to make your shares extremely profitable anyways. Qnx margins may be a few bucks a car now, But neither you nor I know yet how they are going to monetize Ivy, but the possibilities are intriguing. IVY will likely have a recurring rev component which current qnx does not. Potential is there to use an App Store model as ivy is going to be a universal auto ecosystem. Ivy May take a cut on all apps developed to operate in Ivy which last I checked is an extremely profitable setup for Apple. 

Re cybersecurity they only bought CYLANCE 2years ago so to say their cyber security is disappointing is judging on a very limited info.  They now have machine learning built into their cyber security which is a good, explainable market differentiator. Give it a minute. Last I checked it was FEYE not BB who got hacked by last week with all of their tools stolen to reek havoc on the world. 

Anyways 12 months from now you‚Äôre going to be bragging about how you have 1000 blackberry shares and rode it all the way up to 50 so enjoy.

amazon is opening a pharmacy and buying out or doing investments into different technologies or industries so they're prime for growth imo however they definitely do seem to have reached a peak of sorts
They‚Äôre sales are increasing every year and just had a record breaking 3rd quarter. Through the 3rd quarter of 2020, they sold 36% more cars than they did in the first 3 quarters of 2019, which is higher than 33%.

The EV market is growing rapidly, so trying to undercut Lucid could also be an attempt to grab up more of this growing market. Your conclusion would only be definite if the EV market was stagnant.

It finally hit me that comcast might be a good long term hold. Premier League is exploding in popularity now and NBC owns the rights to the premier league which is on their peacock app. I just bought the 5$ membership and might stop watching soccer on illegal streams for good
If it passes without issue it's either priced in or only nudge a little higher. I don't think it'll do much at this point. Don't use that as a catalyst for anything.
That's kind of the problem though.  
If your only goal is just to be content, you'll never be content.  


  
People need new goals, even if it's simple ones like painting the garage, or remodeling the kitchen, otherwise ennui and depression kick the shit out of them.  


Having new goals, new experiences and making progress in life is the only real way to be happy. Otherwise you're just stagnating.

"Three days before the filing from Resolute on Oct. 29, Ark released a statement that it would explore the potential replacement of Resolute Investment Distributors Inc. -- an affiliate of Resolute Investment Managers -- to distribute its products."

Whats the play for next week
This is obscene and unreal how speculative the market has become on some stocks - GME should be worth at least a few billion...though I can't agree with giving it the same multiple these IPOs have
Everyone on WSB thinks it‚Äôs crashing Monday. Therefore it may hold or actually be slightly green.
Yeah man, sounds like issues waiting to happen. Tinder?
Let's hope your right. I got some 12/18 calls I've been holding too
Already bought. About 50k worth of shares
Dropped with the Slack acquisition news. Definitely will go up in the future. I bought shares.

I will direct you to many comments in this sub of people dumb enough to do that.
That‚Äôs a cute name for your left hand
That is definitely **not** the only thing GME has going for it. You do realise that they just did 1 BILLION in revenue in the worst quarter they've had for years? And that their market cap is JUST over a billion right now? And that they're expected to do WELL OVER 2 BILLION in revenue this **quarter**? Even if we don't reach ATH market cap, this thing's still going to at least double by Q4 earnings. Mark my words.

Also, why is there a lower chance of it squeezing simply by the SP sitting at $14? Please explain cuz it sounds like you just pulled that out of you ass. If anything, shorts are gonna continue piling in - thinking it's not gonna go up - and only add to the magnitude of the squeeze when they are finally forced to cover.

Stop fear mongering. If you don't like GME, stop taking the time to click on posts and comment bs when you clearly have no idea what you're talking about. If you have a LOGICAL argument, I'm all ears. Otherwise, just stop.

Ah yes just focus on the 1-2 and 3rd wave target. For the first wave, swing low was 21.18, and swing high I used was 31.26, then there is retracement at .618 (24.99) for the second wave, then for third wave I use fibb extension on 1-2 and brought down to .618 level to get the 41 price target. Ignore 4-5 because I did the count for purposely for 1,2,3 (I didn‚Äôt put attention into 4,5 because I am only fixated on the third wave price target)

Because when vw squeezed in 2008 there was only 12% short float, but available shares to cover were less than 1%. GME is shorted beyond 120%, and if it starts to squeeze you can bet your ass everyone is going to hold. Especially wsb and ryan cohen, who together have like 16% of the stock. So yeah, people are expecting triple digits on a squeeze.
Would love to stuff her face with my meat
except that short interest KEEPS GOING UP. Melvin literally knows they can't get out of the stock position, hence why THEY DE-RISKED THEIR PUT POSITION on Friday.

I never said they would fire her although some think it could happen. Most people don‚Äôt pay that much attention and they could coast on existing funds and past performance for a while 

But the much more likely situation is she leaves and starts a new fund company. She‚Äôs a superstar now and it would be easy for her. She would own much more of the company and wouldn‚Äôt work for a company that fucked her over at the height of her career and took her business over.

I mean it‚Äôs obviously a terrible business move by her to have signed the contract at the time but perhaps she really needed the money back then

Regardless leap calls on a fund based around a superstar manager is risky when said manager is losing control and extremely pissed about it publicly
[deleted]
Delivered?
Yep
I was considering that possibility so I considered the alternative. 

Right now there‚Äôs no reason to be bearish... so let‚Äôs assume it‚Äôs bullish... what scenario would keep the stock bullish and yet screw you?

Slow bullish screws you.


And there‚Äôs a couple of reasons to believe there‚Äôs no big push in the next couple of weeks

1) this time of year is bullish but slow moving with limited liquidity and limited volatility in the market as a whole

2) previous bull flags on this stock took a while to fill in the pennant of the bullish triangle before going higher.

What‚Äôs the catalyst for a big bullish move?  News? Earnings? What? Lack of sellers? 

I‚Äôm likely to be in a butterfly or condor position this week

That is a good point, they do have a very small market cap. Acquisition would definitely add a decent premium to the current price. If they are offering a cost competitive solution, hopefully their profit margins are big enough to be sustainable.
[deleted]
>They dropped the price to SELL MORE CARS and INCREASE REVENUE, albeit at a lower profit margin.

**If** they actually met their profit margin goal of 25% they'd have to produce 33% more cars ***just to break even*** on the 8% discount.

They cut prices to **keep existing sales**, not to increase them, pretty obvious from them cutting prices twice the exact week the Lucid Air launched, conveniently undercutting the launch price of their competition.

It isn't about the $44m contract. It's the fact that Palantir serves big data and the pandemic made that even more necessary now. On top of that, Palantir is also opening their services to consumers and small business where it used to be solely for government approved use. 

Now I know you have no idea what Palantir offers as an actual business but let me tell you, they are the absolute best for data insights into your company that are completely customizable and easily extrapolated from. 

Palantir is an amazing tech company and that was true almost a decade or so ago when I was applying. They have finally got the mainstream attention necessary to elevate their business to new heights. 

I'm proud of them for developing a truly remarkable product on the government's dollar before taking on civilian companies. 

The $44m deal is an indicator that Palantir has some serious room to grow with his government expansion even and on top of it the civilian sector.

Tl:dr; Palantir analyzes big data and the pandemic made the need for that even more present.

(Little tidbit: most jobs at Palantir used to require a decently high level security clearance. That shows that the large majority of all their clients were people like the FBI, CIA, etc)

Cathie Wood, head of Ark Investment Management and manager of the wildly popular Ark Innovation ETF (ARKK) -- which almost doubled this year -- is combating a move from Resolute Investment Managers to purchase a controlling stake in her company, according to a regulatory filing. Resolute, which helps distribute mutual funds and ETFs including Ark‚Äôs products, acquired a minority investment in Ark in July 2016 and the option to purchase a controlling voting and equity interest, which is exercisable in early 2021.

Wood is ‚Äúdisappointed‚Äù that Resolute and its private equity owner, Kelso & Company, have issued this ‚Äúunwelcome notice that they intend to seize control of our business,‚Äù she said in a statement. ‚ÄúWe do not believe that equity ownership by a party tangential to our business is in the best interest of ARK‚Äôs stakeholders.‚Äù

There are other companies doing very similar things but those are smaller companies, like Quantum Health. And companies like Bright Health are building out capabilities like what ACCD has as part of their own solutions. But what they're doing is actually the cutting edge of lowering healthcare costs using technology. So yes there are lots of people trying to copy, but its a massive market and they are the leader. Also if a really big HC co wants to do this themselves, they might be better off just acquiring them since tbh they're still a tiny company.

Also a lil blast from the past (yahoos inclusion) [https://money.cnn.com/1999/12/07/markets/techwrap/](https://money.cnn.com/1999/12/07/markets/techwrap/)
"Pfizer Inc. is an American **multinational** pharmaceutical corporation.''

It's a multinational, whose European branches, labs, research and funding made the vaccine.

America had almost nothing to do with the creation of the vaccine, but because they were originally founded in the US, you think this vaccine is American?

Ok buddy. Whatever you say.....
Buy the rumor, sell the news. This is the news. The rumor was a month ago, though actually more like 3 months ago when these companies announced their development. If you diversified into them at that point, you'd be sitting very pretty. Even if one failed, you'd have the others to support you.
Good thinking. Let me guess, it came to you at 3am while you were answering a margin call?
look at GLSI.

Yes, but only on the surface. The pilot made those errors due to inadequate training and missing safeguards. The plane just shouldn't allow the pilot to unlock the feathering mechanism when it isn't safe to do so. This was mentioned in the report as well.

SS2 is quite complicated to control and you might argue that the SS2 design isn't really fit for human pilots as-is. SS2 is old-school manually controlled, just like experimental spaceplanes of the 50/60s. Back then, using computers to fly a plane was still science fiction, but of course that hasn't been true for a long time. Modern spacecraft shouldn't really need pilots.

I see well I don't have any evidence against that haha. Just to play devil's advocate - can other big competitors easily adopt a similar healthcare platform/business plan? I also noticed their major revenue is concentrated among a few companies which might not be doing too well during the pandemic. How's their financials and potential to capture more customers over other big players? I personally don't know too much about the healthcare insurance industry but I know it is a very congested/competitive space for sure

You missed the entire point. Sure, your 13 model S discounts example would hold true if they sold the same amount after the discount. But that‚Äôs not how supply and demand works. They dropped the price to SELL MORE CARS and INCREASE REVENUE, albeit at a lower profit margin.

That‚Äôs fine, I was off a little bit, but an additional $2.5 million dollars in profit is still huge. The major point is that they are simultaneously chasing dozens of these little 25c gains, and they all add up big time.

While I‚Äôm not in the automotive industry, I‚Äôve worked on projects for automakers and I‚Äôve heard firsthand that they do value <$1 improvements, because it‚Äôs simple math.

Your initial claim that these have to be at the expense of quality is also false. There are ALWAYS ways to improve the design and manufacturing process at no cost to quality, it just takes a talented team of engineers looking for the ‚Äúfreebies‚Äù. And like I said earlier, those freebies add up big time.

Because Toyota makes 10 million vehicles a year while Tesla makes 300,000 - not 100 million as you hyperbolically said in your first reply.

It takes only 13 Model S discounts to eat the entire savings from 0.25 on every car Tesla produces. Only 9787 more to offset so they don't have to eat a $54 million loss of ***profit***. Not even revenue, profit, they still have to make the cars they just don't get as much for doing it.

Yes 12/29 expiration. With your LEAP strategy I doubt you'll take any real losses tbh. Usually it is a small 5-10% drop but can't say for sure - it all depends on what insiders and early investors choose to do. In addition, it usually recovers 2-3 days after the lockup ends since institutions have been waiting for a bottom or dip to start a position and might have guidelines that a stock has to release certain % of outstanding before they are allowed to build a position. Since you are July 2021, I wouldn't even worry about it if you believe in the long term prospects of the company

in both Nio and Xpev. This is the only EV stocks worth owning right now (tsla too overvalued, limited upside). The main clue is how many institutions and hedge funds are in this one, providing it with a solid price floor.
I‚Äôve got a chunk in calls and unfortunately in my mind a successful flight in the next week only somewhat mitigates this failure. The problem is that they were coming off a couple successful flights and this and two others in short succession were going to be the last ones before flying customers. 

Now what? They don‚Äôt have a long streak of successful flights over time, this test flight was hyped and the engine didn‚Äôt fire. What people want to spend 250k to fly on this anytime soon? How many extra test flights need to be done to establish a reasonable streak of safety before sending paying customers?

This isn‚Äôt a matter of fly successfully in a week and forget about this.

That's included in their partnership with msft right?
IMO can we reasonably assume that the index funds have not bought in yet (for the most part) because why would they risk possibly paying a higher price on the stock going towards inclusion?

Yes, they don‚Äôt want to cannibalize their cash cows. Most importantly, the infrastructure just isn‚Äôt there to support EV charging at that scale. Even Tesla owners are going to face the days of reckoning when they drive out during peak holidays next year and want to charge their car on the way and realize they #420 on the line to chargers. 

Right now, EVs are best positioned as a second car. Something thats a daily driver from home to work. But if you want to take a road trip, you either need to be prepared to take less favorable stops along the way or plan for delays on charging stations at the popular ones. How many people can afford 2 cars? I‚Äôm not even using my one car anymore and don‚Äôt think will go back to commuting 5 days a week ever. 

Low cost EVs would be awesome for the gig delivery folks. That‚Äôs where buying a $20k car would work but buying a $40k model 3 doesn‚Äôt work.

I really need to stop buying weeklies.... I literally never win with weeklies unless it is a massive move in 8 hours

Anything longer and my calls go right back down to 0% profit
So a bunch of boomer shit that might gain 20% annually and a biotech that can easily drop 50%, ok.

You're missing the point,  anything that can grow 500% in 5 years might realistically grow 50-100% in 6-12 months. Might have a few 10%+ days in the mix. Buy some calls on high growth shit like SQ and you'll get paid.

That‚Äôs silly. Even if they pass a Bill to increase taxes, it‚Äôll have a future date for it to take effect. New administration doesn‚Äôt even take office until January 21st. Lol
The pay is relatively the same unless you work for a tech giant.  It isn‚Äôt going up now, cause as people lose jobs , people are just going to keep the same job and be ok with the pay as they assign more work.  Or the ones searching for jobs aren‚Äôt going to be picky nor negotiate as they need a roof and food.  

I hope people realize they can live with less, and avoid those recurring payments or subscriptions

In my perfect world, we'd have healthcare for all already. I'm totally on board with what you're saying. In the case of the covid vaccine, I'm pretty sure everyone will be able to get it for free regardless (either through existing insurance or gov funds for the uninsured). But as long as they're not price-gouging, I'll never begrudge a company making a profit.

Yeah if you're working full commission for an insurance company, you're going to be selling insurance. There exists other forms of financial advisors who deal in actual advice and not sales. You want to look at fee only RIAs who employ CFP's.
Micro me harder daddy.
Here‚Äôs a crazy idea. 

$SEARS had delayed IPO due to pricing. Basically institutions are paying a hefty $40 for IPOs in dark pool and flipping it to retail for $160 

The problem is that they don‚Äôt get to keep the $160. Which means banks are actually pocketing the $160 diff while the $40 goes to IPO company. 

SPACs levels the playing field and forces everyone to pay the same price. 

This allows the full amount pre merge to go to the company. 

$PSTH and $SEARS

Dude ok here‚Äôs what you do, this is the pro move.

Throw some TP in the bowl - this muffles the plop sound while gently easing your turd into its watery home. It wrap the fece like a little paper robe, thereby not allowing unsightly skid marks to appear as the poo bounces off the walls on its way down with the flush. And to muffle the farting sound, when you feel one coming, use the seat to spread your buns, and simultaneously wad up some toilet paper over your butthole as a muffler. Don‚Äôt shit on your hand.

I haven't actually... but why would you leave ARK when its so well run and have an established track record of making money. In the end you make money based on changes in the price of the underlying portoflio not on supply and demand for shares in ARK funds... so I don't see the point of switching to other innovation ETFs.

I‚Äôve been following the gaming sector for many years now and the explosion of streaming on both YouTube and Twitch in the last two years has been insane. Some of the bigger names in sports are realizing just how much money is in Esports. Everyone uses Corsair and Razor for keyboards and headsets and I would think they‚Äôre also getting into audio too. But on YouTube alone I (believe) there was a stat that gaming hours watched doubled from 40B to 100B in the year alone. CRSR is a big name in the industry and this is just proof enough that it‚Äôs just getting started.

You have absolutely zero vision if your only concerned about 3 months out.

Find the highest quality,  highest growth stocks with relatively reasonable P/S ratios,  and jump in. AMZN is always a safe bet,  same for SQ. Some EV companies and SPACs are still reasonably priced. 

Tell me what companies will 3-5x over the next 5 years,  just invest in those.

You do you man. Just keep interaction outside fucking to a minimum and be upfront about your expectations
Hell yeah Bruno Mars.
There's a growing field of fee only financial advisors who are intelligent and not in it for money. Also getting a CFP is not easy. 

They wouldn't suggest buying individual stocks based on worldwide news though lol.
The market expects a certain outcome and prices it in.  If the outcome is uncertain it is harder to price it in.  That is why for stimulus talks, any positive development sends us up but negative news doesn't as much.  Market expects a stimulus.  If one is outright denied we go waaaaay down.  The market expected a vaccine and news it was 95% effeftive shot the market up 3%.  We knew it would get approved and that is why we weren't green on the news last week.

I have no idea, I personally think that boosting unemployment insurance created some poor incentives for finding work. I think there should be some difficulty experienced, but at the same time recognize that this wasn't going to be over soon. I don't think the length this virus was going to impact demand was recognized from the beginning, and tools to meter stimulus were given.

For all who say its priced in. There were good chances that allergies in the UK could have pushed the decision back by a week or two,  also a vaccine this fast is a big red flag in general.  I still strongly think PFE is undervalued compared to trash like apple

I don‚Äôt understand any of this. How much higher can the stock price actually get? $10k/share is ridiculous
hmm looks like it is 12/29 expiry and the float will increase by up to 1/3... I'm sure some will sell and lock in gains. Idk, my calls are far OTM and for July 2021 expiry. I just started building my position this week so its only a few grand so far, and no real gains yet. Do stocks usutally drop a lot after lock up?

Brother, I am saddened to hear this, but I think you are better off never trading again. Put your money in a manger fund (for example Cathy's gaff) after paying off urgent debts.

Invest in your well-being, pay for things that make you stable, happy and proud in that order.

Do not let this define your sense of well-being. Managing to warn enough money to punt it out on options means you are way ahead on employability and probably intelligence. Going full degenerative and yoloing it onto options is not for everyone.

You are very strong for facing reality and taking responsibility for your actions. With this attitude you will make it out of this mountain and be better than you could have ever dreamt.

Godspeed brother. I believe in you!

I don‚Äôt like the word bubble. The stock market grows by an average of 10% per year since it all started.

That doesn‚Äôt mean you should expect 10% in a year. A good year, 20-30% up. Bad year. Well, look back to 2008. This year, crazy. 

Correction soon? No idea, but it‚Äôll come. The average is still 10%, this year hasn‚Äôt changed that.

Personally, I think the vaccine has already been priced into the stock.

Let's not forget there are so many competitors that will be in the market sooner or later.

Bingo my man. Nah I actually was one of those boot kids that was training to go special ops before a motorcycle accident so I‚Äôm sidelined for another 2 years and relearning everything I was doing. It‚Äôs one of those things where the concept of following it will eventually build and compound itself enough with consistency and become a better habit instead of the commercialized ‚Äúbest‚Äù habit, you want to go for the long run approach, save yourself a ton of time down the road because you‚Äôre building concepts to last, and not just on trends. And I totally get the emotional eating part, it‚Äôs like shopping hungry, realize when the odds are against you so don‚Äôt play that game, play a game of very basic structure, I‚Äôm not gonna screw up now, you got momentum, turn that opportunity down and wait until the odds are in your favor, when you realize the ‚Äúgame‚Äù is working and you‚Äôre eating healthier. Really just anything to help you in the future be more receptive to motivation, cuz that comes and goes. Very good concepts in trading too hahaha.

Just to throw it out there, as a healthy adult you are not necessarily safe.

A man I know who is in his late 30s and is an avid body builder is currently in the hospital on a vent.  I‚Äôm taking the vaccine because he‚Äôs stronger than me and it knocked him out.
The day after TSLA inclusion into the SP500. Huge run up leading to its inclusion‚Äî we‚Äôve seen the stock rally from 405 to 605 in less than a month‚Äî roughly a 50%, with the catalyst stemming from intense buying purchase from funds. 

I suspect many people will cash out on the 21/22‚Äì after TSLA has been added. Since the SP500... is what trades the top 500 American companies... I suspect the intense selling from TSLA (currently poised to be the 6th largest holding of SP) will cause panic selling.

SPY at 375 Monday. Bears lose their minds. Consolidate to 372ish Tues/Wed before melting up all the way to 390/400 by end of year with another chance of pull back around 390 before 400/410 (which may be January).

He is correct. It took one day to design the vaccine once the bioNtech team had the DNA sequence from China back in jan/feb. The scientists know almost all the rules for designing a functional mRNA vaccine once the virus has been identified. An mRNA vaccine can be designed and trial batches produced by a team of under 5. 

Shepherding production for a 30k person clinical trial, running that clinical trial, working with regulatory bodies for almost 200 countries and then working out logistics for 8 billion people, worldwide, of a product that must be kept at -80C, takes a massive, massive team of people the likes of only a global pharma company can muster. This normally takes years and years. 

That first part cost maybe 100,000$, the second costs over $1B.

I don't have a problem with that, in theory, but Pfizer is a publicly-owned, for-profit company. Making money for their employees and shareholders is their job. Unless the government wants to do all the r&d and production and distribution themselves,  somebody's got to make a profit.

I was going to try it on my wife's phone but she is too busy talking to guys on tinder.
Its a great company., really well run, and solving a major problem in the market with a leading technology solution. It is growing quickly. Its also a smaller marketcap company, so it can jump up a lot very fast. Also it trades at like 13x P/S but the high range of comparable comanies (Teladoc) trades at 40x, and the lower range, Health Catalyst, trades around 8x. Its grwoing faster and serves a much bigger market than HCAT. IMO it could get acquired by TDOC as that would add a lot of strategic value to the company.
This bumps

Terrible analysis. I‚Äôd be absolutely shocked if Tesla ever got back to $400
Well that depends.

Are you will to sell them at a price lower than 24?
I simply chose a line where price rejected off it a bunch of times. It shows there's some significance.

With Nasdaq, it went up so much that it just breaks every straight line there is which makes sense since it's parabolic. Since April, it has nearly gone vertical on the monthly. 

Yes, dot com crash in 1999/2000 but try drawing a trendline from there, Nasdaq breaks every line. Even the one I have from just a few years ago has already broken and became support.

Vaccine approval not priced in
Vaccine marks the top of this bubble now just wait for that rotation back into bonds
I agree is some aspects. But in others this is NOTHING like the dot com bust. 90% of internet companies in 2000 had very little adoption and honestly slim to no revenue. 

AirBnB? They have CRAZY adoption across most of the globe. Lift? Uber? Same shit. Adoption and revenue are high. Sure they lose money. But they aren‚Äôt going anywhere. Worst comes to worse someone aquires them for sure adoptions sake. 

So I‚Äôd say yes things are over valued. But it‚Äôs a very different situation.

Is there not interest rates on the margin?
So lets say you use all of it to buy and long hold some shares. The entire time you're  racking up interest. Lets say that stock doesn't  grow. Or your stuck bag holding some shit options. The odds of you making enough to pay the margin AND any interest is decreasing the longer you sit on it. Let alone make profit above that.

You take that fking W then feel bad after cause billys been sitting alone for the next 3 years of highschool and you realize you didnt want that for billly you just wanted to have a normal life and have fun but its to late everyone hates billy and your in your stride, fk billy man hell get over it. 

but deep down in side after day 40 years later you relize you actually just wanted to be friends with billy.

Us overall death rates are up just over 1% yoy just like they have been every year since 2014. That means that COVID deaths has had net zero impact on death rates. Why would anyone who looks at big picture economic impact of death rates on stock valuation care when literally nothing has changed statistically from COVID deaths? Take a look at unemployment figures as well. Nov 2020 unemployment rate is equal to 2014 unemployment. 2009-2013 unemployment is worse than it is this quarter. Yes COVID has been horrible and will have a lasting impact on many things at a micro level but the US is doing extremely well at the macro level.

The point is to say we have the opportunity to enter the top 10% and live a better life than if you were top 10% in Canada. The US spends more per capita on social welfare programs than Canada by every metric. Lets say you live in DC (cause thats where I live) and lose your job. You qualify for unemployment, housing subsidies, SNAP, WIC, Medicare, and there is a district wide eviction/rent increase freeze. If that is less than you get in Canada then I am willing to accept the difference since the other 95% of my life when I'm not on those programs I will be making more on average, have a higher standard of living, and can reasonably attain a position within a higher strata than in Canada.

Old people dying isn't good for business.

I don‚Äôt think they are talking about apple Amazon Microsoft Facebook or google. I think they companies are pretty fairly valued. I think zoom is ridiculously overvalued when you consider only 10% of the company is available to buy in the market and that 10% is 90 billion $ so snowflake is worth as much as Facebook. That makes sense right??? Snowflake vs Facebook. Zoom is glorified Skype. Most Ev companies are trash and will die off. Tesla is worth more than Berkshire fucking Hathaway.

Dude its going to go up astronomically. Just look at the rig counts and there is no exploration happening. No exploration = less supply when your demand increases.

The 100 billion valuations are financially engineered. If you have enough money, you can set the price for any stock. 

If you have data on previous IPOs, an army of bots for social media, a PR-team, etc., you can engineer FOMO (i.e., exploiting a human weakness called greed), which brings us to DASH and ABNB. 

None of these companies are an investment (although, more than 50% will believe they are "investing"). The real players understand it's just about figuring out when the future bag holders will figure it out and sell the day before.

Also when the mechanic has to pay more for the parts to replace, more for his groceries, his electric, his insurance, his rent, his employess he's going to increase the prices a lot too and this goes for any other service, plumbers etc.

When I hear 2-3% inflation I have to f laugh at the audacity.  I live pretty simple and bare minimums and the inflation is way above that.  

I can't imagine what people with kids that have to pay for daycare, or ones that have to help out with college tuitions, while having to pay for newer cars, phones are now pushing 1500, and while renting.  There are people living like this and their expenses must be rising astronomically.
Those pilots are some brave souls going up in those aircrafts...
Received mine but will open it after S&P5 00 inclusion.

Ahh, that strata part isn‚Äôt a positive, it‚Äôs actually pretty indicative of the wealth and income inequality problems when compared to the amount of people not in the upper strata. Not saying we‚Äôre dirt poor here, but saying our upper strata live better than anywhere else is sorta unrelated. Also, when adjusting for healthcare and cost of living average, Canada and the US are pretty close, with Canada actually outperforming us in key stats

I think it is much much harder to post huge gains with larger sums of money. With 30k you can diversify while still consolidating enough to see a huge reward on just a couple good trades. You can't do that with 30 billion. Also their intent and mission is to beat the market while still preserving the capital. By nature their intent is not to be high beta taking on huge risk with a delta skew.

Such a stupid saying. It assumes the whole efficient market system is true. I really doubt Pfizer goes up a ton on this news, but if it‚Äôs up 10 percent in the next month everyone on here will be saying it‚Äôs because of the vaccine.

Like saying that covid was priced in during February. Everyone knew it was here as prices were going to all time highs.  Sometimes the market is irrational. Try to be on the right side of it. That said - buying calls on Pfizer solely because of this news is fucking stupid.

People are talking like it will be months till the next test flight. The ship and motor are meant to be swapped quickly to have each ship flying quickly. Hell, SS2 flew again within 1 week (to get the x prize), and that was in 2004.

You don‚Äôt have the same risk management a hedge fund has. You don‚Äôt have investors like a hedge fund has.

I'm going long an AZN since that is the vaccine that the majority of the world will use since it's much easier to store. Just imagine how many regions in the world don't have a facility large enough to keep millions of vaccine doses on ice. Especially if they don't have reliable power.
I am also all in on UNFI. It‚Äôs being manipulated and short interest is insane. Wait till the entity has to cover. Holding 25K shares long cost average under 10 bucks.

My money is on PLTR. But haven‚Äôt looked at spce. You‚Äôll have to dig deeper there to gauge valuation and momentum on news flow. My feeling is that PLTR should have a steady stream of increasingly Positove news flow with each additional new contract it keeps gaining. It‚Äôs practically a monopoly of sorts with a strong moat and TAM app onto itself. People talk about it‚Äôs high valuation but i feel like it warrants it given it‚Äôs strong dominate position in AI. It‚Äôs playing a role in vaccine logistics and is partner of choice for government and commercial contracts now. spce feels like a further down the   Road story.
If six independent organisations can do that, apparently it's not *that* difficult.

Depends on where you live. The US has massive disparity based on geographic location in the country. We have a huge homelessness problem, particularly child homelessness, that is underreported. It‚Äôs partly because of economics, but also because of child custody retention laws and shitty public foster/adoption systems. 
Yeah, the media hypes it a bit, but it exists, especially in our poorest states and counties. However, mile long food bank lines isn‚Äôt something I‚Äôve really seen, because most food banks are dispersed between the gov, the charities, and the churches. It‚Äôs only during crisis times that you might see a large line to a government food bank (plus EBT and all that.)
Difference being they actually make $$ where as SPCE makes 0 revenue and operates in consumer space where people won‚Äôt fly if there is a crash.
This past week I would buy Tesla call slightly OTM when oversold. If it continued to deep I would buy another. If it continued to dip I would buy a third. Then it would bounce and I would take 1 or 2 off for a couple hundo profit and let the one ride with tight stop loss. 

Rinse and repeat. Hope I can continue this next week even tho it does give me a heart attack. Was in 3 50.00 contracts at one point

Fun fact, I've never seen 'the big short', disagree if you disagree but no need to be so patronising and assume the other person is completely stupid and gets all there information from a film simply because he disagrees with you. Maybe I should have explained why I think this will happen. Here in the UK we've had superb government support in the form of the furlough scheme and increased quantative easing, in the US they've had the stimulus checks and also quantitive easing. Once government support goes out the window (which it will, especially in the UK under our austerity loving tory government), my bet is the markets are going to flop. I don't think it will be a re run of 2008, however I do think the tech market will be hit hard, especially so called trendy stocks which can't justify their valuations (think tesla), this is why the title is dot Com bubble 2.0 and not 2008. 2. Anyway, I hope this answers your questions and you're more than welcome to disagree.

Virgin Galactic is no Nikola, but they just don't have a good product. SpaceShipTwo is a dated design with many issues, and it shows. They merely scaled up the SpaceShipOne design from the Ansari X-Prize. A vehicle purposely built to win that prize, incapable of anything else. They've been working on it for around 16 years and it's still not close to operational.

Mind-boggling, if you compare it to SpaceX, a company only about a year older than Virgin Galactic.

I have absolutely no idea why so many people are believing this trainwreck will ever make any money and pump this stock.
Seriously?

I have quite a bit in industries that cratered and I bought up. Things like AAL that could be 300% if it just returns to normal, RYCEY that‚Äôs almost 6x, UAL, JETS, CNK, WDC, BA etc.

Anyway, did you get out before yours recovered to pre-pandemic, or was everything already exceeding those numbers?

I‚Äôve ditched a few things that exceeded pre-pandemic price, and all but one were the best decision.

That was a decision made to sell *more* cars and drive *up* revenue, making small bottom line improvements even more important. They are trying to drive sales to the Toyota / Volkswagen level, where 25 cent gains are coveted.

All that are not big factors to stock price. It‚Äôs all about market expectations and belief, they could be in debt and stock price could still rise.

SEE YOU IN VALHALLA
Tech is going to get massacred on monday
The biggest problem with buy/sell sentiment is everyone trades on different timelines. when the market was tanking during corona, it was a great time to buy 500DTE calls, terrible time to buy 0DTE calls.
People actually believe they will make money launching rich people and celebs. Hilarious
March they are looking at a crash if Defferments arent extended.
I put the stonks meme in my final.
Geez what a coincidence I was watching diamonds are forever and I paused to turn on my phone and this is is what I see. No kidding
When did these go on sale?
So should it just not be approved and wait if the next one is better? Are you holding MRNA and salty or something? I don‚Äôt get it
time to load up on more cheap calls/stonks. But first hope it drops to 10$ range. haha
Guys what‚Äôs your view on fucking colleagues? Recently broke up with my gf and there is that very needy 6/10 at work who just wants to get banged
I like to see what everyone is getting hyped up on over the weekend so I can plan my puts accordingly
They just cut $5,570 off the price of every Model S a couple months ago to avoid losing customers to the Lucid Air, I really don't think a quarter is going to matter in comparison, it's a rounding error.

But that‚Äôs the best time to get it. They should open up on sundays
I‚Äòm from Germany,bratwurst is not that bad sometimes!
But I think most of the global player are based in the U.S and China, so would be dumb not to let it work for us?!

Haven‚Äôt done puts yet but I‚Äôm put-curious.

What would you recommend as a safe long put, and by safe I only mean I don‚Äôt wanna owe a fuck ton of money after this play
I know we're not suppose to talk about digital currency, but this is good news for dogecoin right?
Totally a power play
CloudFLARE with an L, do it again bitch.  Take 2.
That‚Äôs gores holding, not the merge company
It's paneful
Our media has learned that the way to get views is to constantly show/hype up every possible negative aspect of society or incident that takes place. If it bleeds, it leads
And none of these companies want to be seen as gouging people in a pandemic so they will not make a lot of money on these deals. At least the vaccine will keep older people alive so they can keep buying meds.
how come RH won‚Äôt let me buy puts on doordash gdi
It‚Äôs had the broadest impact over the longest term...
100 percent agree. Is 900 billion not enough for that?
On expiration, it‚Äôll be an instant bleed, so there‚Äôs an upside
No that isnt true. The US has a higher standard of living, higher median income, and much higher upper strata than Canada. Even if there is a food bank with miles of lines that would be a few thousand people out of 340 million.
It was funny NBC news was running a new piece on long thanksgiving food lines and people were pulling up in brand new Audi A5.

Gonna be big green Monday
people drive their mercedes to get to the food bank and collect their welfare and food stamps. Are we fucked? you tell me.
I know some people personally who are struggling and could use a stimulus due to covid reducing hours/income. Is it blown out of proportion? Sure it could be. Is it real and are there people out there actually struggling? Yes

Yeah some people just don‚Äôt get it, I‚Äôve been following SPCE for a while now and that‚Äôs what it does it‚Äôll boost up with news or launch hype then post launch there‚Äôs nothing to be excited for and the price drops 20% over the course of a week. And I almost couldn‚Äôt believe how cheap the puts were that I got on Wednesday the 27$ 12/18p were only like .30¬¢ easy money. Got some 22$ 12/18p for only a dime lol, EOD Friday everyone else finally got the same idea and those 22$p were trading at .36¬¢ at close and the stock didn‚Äôt even drop.

Right? I read that the U.K. Supreme Court ruled they couldn‚Äôt advertise their bread as bread due to its high sugar content and had to be classified as a confectionary. 

No way it‚Äôs subway. That company sucks ass. In N Out would be sick. That has limitless scale ability and die hard fans. It is a bit small tho, so it wouldn‚Äôt make sense for it to be them based on their current size and what Ackman has said he‚Äôs buying in terms of market cap.

Personally I'm invested in FIII because I've been churning through EV spac's buying them near the bottom then selling them right between DA and IPO, but I honestly believe that 90% of these EV companies are gonna fail. I couldn't imagine holding ANY of them past the IPO.

Branson is a twat but you can‚Äôt compare him to Trevor Milton. SPCE hasn‚Äôt started taking preorders on personal spacecraft with a power system that doesn‚Äôt exist yet claiming licensed tech as IP and offering equity to spaceX in exchange for the right to pay above cost for the chance to manufacture them.
Definitely still in a box in my moms basement. I should probably put them in a safe, lol.
If you observed index futures, last week was basically a series of warning shots. I saw futures be blood red before cash open, and then flip to green in an instant. Signs of high volatility ahead

Nah overblown lot of it is propaganda to try to get more gov $$ for the states and small businesses ( but goes to mostly millionaires )
Yeah but for now it could go down for the next 4-6 weeks before we ever get above 370 again. It took from June 8th to July 17th to go back above 320. It took from Sept 2nd to Nov 12th to stay back above 354. And then from Nov 12th we've already gone up above 370. 

At the same time on Aug 12th I would've thought the market was ripe for a drawdown. Instead it went up another 20+ points then immediately dumped hard.

I dont think pump and dump means what you think it means.....the pump and dump is done by speculators and people with paid buy sell lists they sell they buy, then get you to buy and 5000 other people stock rises, they sell then 5 minuteslater inform everyone to sell ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è thats my understanding anyway.

How much did this cost?
Are they coming out with more items?
I hope for a brutal dip. I own 70 shares now. My goal is 200 so I can just start selling covered calls on this, but the stock rose too quickly in the past few weeks. Hoping it crashes back to <$24 so I can finish loading up.
Go to their website?
Indexing actually doesn't effect price discovery because there will always be active managers who sell their management skills to "beat" the market. Some will succeed, others will fail, but their active management will keep price discovery where it is. 

There will also always be retail investors who don't index, further bolstering discovery. 

You'd need passive indexing to make up a much much greater percentage of invested capital to negatively impact price discovery. But on the plus side, passive capital that doesn't panic might make sell-offs less dramatic.

Edit - to further elaborate, once passive investing has a large impact on discovery, active management will become more rewarding because there will be pricing inefficiency to exploit, and more active managers WILL beat the market returns. Then capital migrates back to active management, and we return to something closer to an equilibrium.

The problem is that lockdowns are half assed. If we committed to a true hard lockdown for the majority of the population and shut down our border for 2 1/2 weeks, the virus would be gone. Other developed countries would follow based on success and we'd slowly re-open international travel.

The economic effects from letting almost 1% of your population die from a virus are a lot worse than a 2 1/2 week full lockdown.

My favorite schtick from virtue signalers that are willing to jump head first into the vaccine because they "support science" is the whole, "What if no one ever got the polio vaccine? Where would we be?"

It's like talk about a false equivalency. If there was a chance COVID paralyzed me and shortened my lifespan as a healthy adult I'd take fucking three of the vaccine.

I am personally not concerned about the car part of Tesla. There are plenty of EVs and it‚Äôs really nothing new. From that perspective, the comparisons with other car makers changes, but it‚Äôs still in play. 

My point of interest is how the cars are manufactured and how they are viewed and will be in the future. With the conversion with newer tech suck as IoT, BigData and AI a new approach is adopted to make products. With data extracted from products during and even after deployment, it is possible to run extensive simulation. AI is used to come with optimized designs and enhancements. Anyone handling design manually will always be at a disadvantage. 

When we start viewing cars as smart moving nodes that generate and use data, a whole new world of possibilities (lookup VW CEO‚Äôs definition of what his company should be). 

When you put the whole thing together, you can see that designing cars requires retooling and rethinking everything. You can‚Äôt just fit sensors and an electric motor any car to have a Tesla which was built from the ground up in the new way. 

It‚Äôs been said Tesla was not car company. I think it is embodiment of the new way to manufacture products. Anyone can lookup: Fourth Industrial Revolution. Maybe Tesla will share its platform and become the AWS of manufacturing. Somebody making a smart fridge could use it. Why build from scratch?

Your distrust of the market (because you watched the big short one time), doesn't mean that actual big players have no trust in the market. Don't you think that the stock drop in march would have been the "snowball of doom"? 

I actually think that the relatively fast recovery from the 2008 crisis actually inspired hedgefunds etc to just keep going with the upward trend, because in the worst case the government will bail them out anyway.

I hate everything about this, but I do think that this is the sad reality.

I‚Äôve been looking at these calls since I got the email from ark and saw tak on there. It‚Äôs not a big mover at all so I wanted something further out than January. Did you buy immediately once you saw ark bought? I saw Thursday and then got the email late Friday but the markets were closed by then.
Well last investor day it popped 10% too. So I‚Äôd say this play was a coin toss
Problem is there are so many millionaires today. Heck a friend in college made some shitty program that a company bought for 2mill just in case it comes to sthing one day, they dont want it as competition. So many people are getting stupid rich from random startups that big companies buy for millions. When so many people have lots of cash, things go up in price. Brother bought a peugeot 208 for 15k 4 years ago. The new one is over 20k. Thats 33% increase in 4 years.

Twenty years ago we didn't have a Fed printing money like it was going out of style.  But maybe it is going out of style.. 

Yet my point is that, even if the market does dump like the .com bubble burst, the Fed will be inclined to continue printing lest they allow the market to suffer even deeper lows.   We've become codependent on Gov money.   And perhaps ultra low interest rates too.

Because you're a fan boy, there's no point arguing.

As an example, the Renault Zoe costs ¬£27k compared to the Model 3 at ¬£37k so I'm not sure how you think Tesla is cheaper to manufacture?

Tesla seems to have a massive issue with actually delivering cars as they take several months to actually get them to customers. Hence why the Zoe overtook them in Europe.

NIO day on Jan 9th will definitely shoot the stock up as we get closer to the date and it seems like all the negative catalysts are behind us.

Not sure if the stock will continue to fall next week from the share dilution, and idk if the vaccine approval will have any kind of impact on the stock either, so next week is up in the air but after that it should be smooth sailing to above $50 again and maybe even ATH.

They have no significant revenue until they start flying people up. This test was originally scheduled for autumn, and on the basis of a success would be followed by Branson going up early next year, and then the start of commercial operations.

That's what was priced in, now it's looking less likely. We're in December and no successful test yet. If the company continues to burn cash who knows what impact that could have.

That's why the price will tank.

Our stock market crashed in march and did a V-shape recovery back to ATH in only a few months.

Yes but have some stupid shit that actually requires you to rebuild in the same property (definition of smooth brain).  Sad as fuck seeing folks begging government to buy them out as they are tired of their house being flooded 3 or 4 times in a row.  That shit is going to have to get fixed in the next 5 years as even JP won't be able to print enough money soon.

Nation of Islam teaches that black people are the true Israelis/children of god and that an evil black scientist created white people (including and especially Jews) which then infiltrated society and tricked/kicked black people out. Or something along those lines. But they were the "original" kings and queens. Also references back to Egyptian days, ignoring that the Egyptian pharoahs/rulers for 100s of years before the time of Christ were the Ptolemys who were Greek and vassals of the Romans.
Just think for a second about how retarded you sound.  If you think you‚Äôre smart then please try this plan and report back when you‚Äôre bankrupt.

Why does it feel like the fallacy that bull runs (as in monthly cycles) never end always repeats itself over and over? Just look at a candlestick chart of SPY the last year. Literally every large run up of green candles is followed by a red candle streak. We traded between 300-320 for *months* then jumped to 360 just based on the election being over. I'd be shocked if there isn't a testing of support levels below 360 for the rest of our lives.

I'm not saying increased supply doesn't lower the price in the long run but as you yourself said the supply is not increasing, new homes are not being built, they're essentially scalping the housing market.

The only way you could really get your money back from repairing home (in a timely manner that doesnt take 10 years)  that is literally uninhabitable is to rent it for a high price and make the tennant's pay for the mortgage.

A great post from the coronavirus subreddit:

How is it possible to create a safe and effective vaccine in such a short period of time?

Hello all!

In light of the vaccine approvals that have already come and will likely continue to develop over the coming days and weeks, we wanted to take a moment to discuss some of the background for how we've been able to safely and effectively develop a vaccine so rapidly.

From our new [FAQ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/wiki/faq):

Several factors enabled rapid development and testing of vaccines without compromising safety or efficacy.

First, previous research has enabled us to reduce the time necessary to begin developing and testing a vaccine candidate. Advances in vaccine technology have allowed researchers to develop vaccines based only on the genomic sequence of the virus in question ([released on Jan 10th](https://virological.org/t/novel-2019-coronavirus-genome/319)). As such, vaccine scientists were able to begin development of vaccine candidates in mid-January, even though the virus was still difficult to obtain at that time.That said, due to global spread of the virus in the following months, laboratories around the world have independently isolated and generated stocks of virus that then could be used to test vaccine efficacy.

In addition, we have considerable existing research on other human coronaviruses, including SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, that we were able to use to gain rapid insight into SARS-CoV-2. Ordinarily, pharmaceutical companies would wait for more basic research into the novel virus to develop a vaccine with best chances at high efficacy, in no small part due to the high cost of running clinical trials and bringing a vaccine to market. In this case, however, governments around the world were willing to underwrite significant portions of the costs of clinical trials, reducing the financial risk  for pharmaceutical companies to develop and produce a vaccine without preliminary data,but heavily leveraging existing research into coronaviruses. These two factors likely reduced the timeline required for vaccine development by months to years. 

Second, administrative delays in the vaccine-development timeline were mitigated or outright eliminated during the development of the COVID-19 vaccine candidates. One of the most important such delay is the processing of data and applications between phases of trials or after a trial is complete. For example, just for the formal new drug application stage alone, the [United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA)](https://www.gao.gov/mobile/products/GAO-20-301) has a target of 8 months to process and review priority applications, with a target of 12 months for regular applications; delays beyond this timeframe are not uncommon, and the new drug application is only one of several intermediate applications that are needed to progress through different phases of clinical trials. By contrast, the applications to progress through clinical trials for the COVID-19 vaccine candidates are being processed and analyzed in a more timely manner by regulatory agencies -- again, shaving unnecessary months to years off the approval timeline.

Third, the nature of the pandemic makes the clinical trials easier to conduct. One of the most difficult and time-consuming tasks for a vaccine or drug candidate is to show superiority over existing drugs or vaccines that are on the market already; however, there were no existing vaccines against COVID-19, so the vaccines simply needed to be tested for superiority over a placebo. In addition, clinical trials often have difficulty enrolling subjects; it normally takes months to years to fully enroll a clinical trial. However, with the number of individuals that wanted to join each of the vaccine trials, enrollment was completed with unprecedented speed. Finally, trials for vaccine candidates often take a long time to complete even after enrollment because many of the pathogens they seek to prevent are relatively rare or regional; as a result, it takes considerably longer for enough infection events to occur, and accordingly longer to be able to determine whether the vaccine is effective. However, in the midst of a global pandemic, infection events are in no short supply, and by sheer numbers, people are infected rapidly in the trials and statistical significance can be reached much more quickly. Again, collectively, these factors reduce the needed timeline by months to years without sacrificing rigor. 

Despite this speed, we are still able to effectively judge whether these vaccine candidates will be safe. We have considerable knowledge of the fundamental biology underlying many of these vaccine candidates that allow us to better judge their safety, and after confirmation of their safety, human studies using RNA as therapeutic, both for [vaccines](https://www.nature.com/articles/nrd.2017.243), and in other ways to treat diseases are underway since years. Although  mRNA vaccine are yet to be approved by the FDA for use in humans (in large part due to low cost-benefit to companies), the molecular biology of mRNA has been studied extensively for decades, and knowledge of the biological pathways involved with mRNA processing and degradation allows us to state with a high degree of confidence that the active component of the vaccine will be degraded quickly and poses no increased risk of causing genetic aberration. (Of note: an infection with the real virus or withany other common cold RNA virus, will generate vastly more viral mRNA in the body's cells than the vaccine carries.) This was borne out in the [animal studies](https://apnews.com/article/fact-checking-afs:Content:9792931264) of the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, which found their vaccines did not cause toxicity in animals and conferred immunity against the virus. In addition, the most prominent vaccine candidates (mRNA and adenovirus vectors) do not contain the whole genomic sequence of the SARS-CoV-2 virus or even an attenuated/inactivated version of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, meaning that they present no risk of actually causing COVID-19.

The trials are also sufficiently long (even with all this streamlining) to be able to catch adverse events that would occur with any significant frequency. Indeed, the vast, overwhelming majority of adverse events after vaccination present within days to weeks of vaccination. For example, the very rare, but one of the most severe possible side-effects, Guillane-Barre syndrome (GBS) almost always arises within [6 weeks](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC6985921/) of receiving the influenza vaccine; [other adverse reactions](https://www.aafp.org/afp/2017/0615/p786.html) due to vaccines present similarly quickly or even sooner. This timeframe for adverse events to appear is markedly shorter than the time for evaluation of the vaccine candidates. The FDA, for example, mandated that the subjects in the trial had to be monitored for a median of [at least two months](https://www.fda.gov/media/142749/download) before an emergency use authorization application would be considered. This enables regulatory agencies to adequately assess the safety profile of the vaccines. In clear contrast, the viral infection carries significant side-/chronic effects for a large number of people, and without vaccine immunity, at least 50-70% of individuals would be infected without indefinite public health measures. 

To summarize, the development of these vaccines has not been this rapid because we have cut corners or sacrificed rigor. Moreso, these trials have progressed at a rapid pace because of pre-existing research and technology that could be leveraged to develop a vaccine candidate quickly, policy decisions to mitigate usual administrative delays, and the impact that rapid spread of a novel pathogen has on the logistics of a clinical trial. Collectively, these factors have comfortably reduced the development timeline by years while still allowing for sufficient assessment of efficacy and safety.

The only other 2 mrtp approvals in history didn't do much to those stocks but, in this case, the approval would then effectively begin the sales process for their product as the entire marketing platform is built around claiming "95% less nicotine".

Most losses happen for traders including myself when they see some big green or red spike and they expect that to continue to only find that it doesn't and then you wait anxiously to see if it will come back to your crappy FOMO price .  Depends on the scenario though. In the AM on a stock with earnings or at a key break out or breakdown level I would possibly trust that momentum. Look at snow on Thursday.  I bought that stock as soon as it traded above the open price at 9:31 at $295 and the spike continued to 315 and then went to 340 by end of day.  Had multiple big pullbacks throughout the move up that you could get long into though.  If a stock is trending down and then you get the counter trend bounce back up that then fails and then goes back to the low if a stock is weak it will break the low and sometimes it can break it hard and fast giving you a quick chance to take profits.
Truly the living avatar of move fast and break shit, that one is.

This is on my watchlist but just because ark is accumulating doesn‚Äôt mean it‚Äôs going to break out this week. 

Watch this market make me eat my words.

Also that call is so cheap because the $20 resistance for tak has been strong as fuk
Nah if it was available we‚Äôd buy it
The technology isn't proprietary to them, though.

I think the smart money would say ipo now while the going is good but you might be right

The market is only to get more over saturated (there are hundreds of acquisition companies stacked with cash looking for targets etc)

I think it‚Äôs a lot less beautiful than you imagine. Let‚Äôs look at Peru, for example. I have family members living near Miraflores whose friends are one by one being priced out of the housing market because wealthy real estate investors continue to bid up the price of housing. Many of these properties are being gobbled up by wealthy Americans/others to be used as Airbnb‚Äôs. The local community gets fucked, while some dude in Dallas collects rent money.

Me too. I have $15 puts x 35. But I'm still bullish on SPCE, with 500 shares. What do you think. Sell puts on Monday, buy calls?
In March most of it was overnight gap downs yes. But if it‚Äôs news driven or a Donnie tweet crashing the market that can happen mid day as well

Look at it this way. The losses are locked and there is nothing you can do about it BESIDES making those losses back. In order to make those losses back you need to be sharp, and fresh, and ready for Monday morning. Being up 40 hours straight on stims plus the sleep deprivation is not going to help you succeed in getting your losses back. Get mad, get angry at yourself for fucking up and use that anger as motivation to get on your broker Monday morning and take money from boomers who blatantly hate us all. I have faith in you, my friend. Come down and go to sleep. Sleep until Monday ready to take your damn money back. Best of luck to you.

Regardless of stimulus and covid, Gold has been on a 2 year bull run, which it broke from in November on news of a vaccine. The 2 year bull run has nothing to do with stimulus or Covid and everything to do with the Fed trying to normalize rates and unload the balance sheet, which they failed at in 2019, and which has become an even bigger problem. Gold was extremely oversold in Nov and needs to hit 2k this month to rejoin the 2 year trend. 

Once the market prices in the fact that the Fed can NEVER raise rates and NEVER unload the balance sheet gold will go to the moon, it's pretty amazing that people aren't pricing it in already and that everyone is ignoring this obvious fact. 

You could buy the DOW for 1 ounce of gold twice in history, during the Great Depression, and during the crisis of the late 1970s. It will happen a 3rd time.

Pivot to what? Where? They can't just pivot to anything.

What value? What growth?

There are other industries besides tech you know. Some are far from recovered and won't until the vaccine is widely available.

The revenue sharing thing was a life line bc they sell Xbox shit. GME has no leverage here. The MSFT deal was a nothing burger and could end up costing them if they're data is vulnerable. That's their best asset.

The only thing GME has going for it is a retail outlet that funnels all things gaming into it. Nothing else, it's all is ever had. It's still brick and mortar located all over the country with expensive leases in areas where foot traffic is declining or today is non existent.

And while competing with steam, Sony, Microsoft, Google, apple ECT....

The PlayStation being available without a disk drive is a huge indicator.

I can now buy my kids games without leaving the house or putting in any effort. Parents are busy which partly why they're losing market share. Internet is just getting faster and more available.

>The call they had for Q3, they said this upcoming quarter will be the best they‚Äôve had in years. Not sure why I would sell on that level of strength. Until demand for the consoles slow or Ryan Cohen throws in the towel on a take over. The opportunity risk is too great.

That's exactly why you would sell. Why do you think it dumped on earnings? Stock is literally a vehicle for forward thinking growth potential. It's for what an investor believes a company will be worth not what it is worth. That's all priced in.

I made some money on them too but my advice is take out your investment and let the rest ride. This is a dead company in the evolving sector of retail.

All it'll take is for a couple of the big names to jump ship or board members cashing out and it's done. Microsoft to say they're not printing hard copies anymore or a dozen other things. They could go into the distressed credit for bailouts. You could easily see a -50% week on GME.

This is 100% about the squeeze. You've more then doubled your money I suggest betting with house money and not lose your investment too.

Sportsman‚Äôs Warehouse is on track for 2020 gross profit to equal about 70-80% of its market cap.

The only explanation I can see is the the fucking mincing ESG crowd has scared everyone from buying it.

Or Wall St is so fucking dumb that they think nothing changed at all about people‚Äôs habits during Covid, despite this being disproven with each passing quarter. I mean Wall St is pretty fucking dumb (Feb 2020 ATHs lmao) but still. You could say lockdowns and stimulus account for May-July numbers but after the most recent quarter it‚Äôs pretty fucking clear there‚Äôs more to it than that.

It‚Äôs also possible that it‚Äôs being manipulated by options sellers, the chart is pretty weird and a ton of options have been written on it as a small cap company.

You're absolutely right and he's being hyperbolic. Should still be able to put away good cash every year and live alone, just not in downtown. 

My friend was making that, lived with roommates in a sweet location (better than where he is in NYC), but he still doesn't regret his move back here. 

Seems like you live more frugally (like my friend) than most. And it all depends on perks you get from the company. He gets a fully reimbursed metrocard every month and bikes everywhere in the city here. So no lyft or car needed.

Weather still better tho lol. Winter is a hellscape. Especially now.

Yeah the truth is if you work in SF in tech for a while you‚Äôll make a good chunk on some stock options sooner or later (even if you don‚Äôt hit it really big) and the yearly promotions are typically at least 5 figures which really adds up over ten or twenty years

But yeah it‚Äôs more expensive to get started for sure and the limited housing is a bummer.

If you remove juvenile sarcasm from your statement, does it boil down to "we have 2% not 40% inflation?"

Because you'd be correct. We have 2% inflation. But equities, real estate, collectables, and other finite resources are skyrocketing in price much higher than inflation due to 40% more money supply than there was a year ago.

If I sell a stock I regularly trade but I'm down on and don't buy it back before December 31st can I realize the loss if I then buy options on the stock. I'm currently showing a decent profit on my account which is more money than I have so I'd like to take the 15k loss without losing the position.
Since mods keep banning my posts see below:

&#x200B;

Listen up retards:

MMEDF (Mind Medicine) is currently trading on O T C (its like a shittier version of the NYSE, and had to add spaces so autmod doesnt auto ban this post). If the stock price can stay above 2 dollars for 5 straight trading sessions (Monday would be the 6th day, currently trading at 3.60), then it will be listed on NASDAQ. Once listed on NASDAQ, it will get in the hands of the Robinhooders, and we all know what they are capable of. This is very similar to how many of the cannabis stocks blew up.

This baby is an early stage meme stock. Don't underestimate how far the meme factor can push this thing. As far as meme stocks go though, MMED has a tier 1 management team and advisory board, including Mr. Wonderful aka Kevin Oleary (that bald asshole on sharktank) and Canopy Growth (weed stock) founder is on the board, Bruce Linton. They are also smartly conducting trials on an array of molecules (LSD, MDMA, DMT, Psilocybe) rather than putting all their eggs in one basket. This reduces the ticker's risk profile IMO.

Also, listen to this: the CEO recently said that Mind Medicine will be "the tesla of mental health", i know you guys like the sound of that!

[https://money.yahoo.com/mindmed-creating-tesla-mental-health-143849890.html](https://money.yahoo.com/mindmed-creating-tesla-mental-health-143849890.html)

This treatment is d i s r u p t i v e AF to the mental health treatment industry. Psychedelics has been shown to be incredibly helpful in treating many complex mental health issues (PTSD, depression, etc.) much more effectively than traditional pharma treatment.

TL:DR - Mind med is about to be added to NYSE aka robinhood-ville, and it will meme and moon, get in before that happens for max gains. In addition, it's a good investment long term

Going to show my ignorance here but aren't options essentially a zero sum game with free trades?  Casinos don't run zero sum games except as very short term specials.  Still doesn't mean you can't lose your shirt very quickly with both.  At least you can get free booze at Vegas casinos.

So many high hopes here. I remember when they told everyone about how awesome the share price would be after the CTL merger. So glad I dumped my CTL stock and put it elsewhere. Some decent people but overall not a place you ever stay for more than a year or two. All the smart people leave and there have been a lot of culture issues after CTL polluted lvl3. The main positive point is the size of their infrastructure and weight in the industry. Not sure if buffet still owns anything here but I think he was one of the founders for lvl3. The amount of potential within process refinement within finance could lead to profitability but no one cares enough to make that happen before being swamped in the next merger.

4. The primary driver of revenue long-term will not be the spaceplane, but hyper fast intercontinental aircraft.

5. There's no safer airline then one that has had a recent accident. And people still fly.

6. They're "losing" money by increasing cap ex -- for a intercontinental space plane. Which is where the revenue will be.

7. Nobody gives a shit. The question is "are they meeting milestones."

8. You're really fixated on superficialities.

"It is not impossible to see GME hit $100/share and maybe even $1,000/share (dream with me) since there is no precedent for a company that has this much short interest. If this occurs, then anyone who put 3K down on this trade would cash out with $2.5 Million.

Risk Mitigation

If we get a squeeze: If GME goes over $30, I will make mad money. Many retail investors will become millionaires off of GME"
Yep made 200 per contract in around 2 hours
Ah, 25k, the magic number required for you to be allowed to make money on stocks. 

It's actually criminal that they don't teach this in school
Well yeah. With the exception of like poker and blackjack they‚Äôre all just blind luck and chance. Most of us try and use our brains in options

But trial 3 data drop data was obvious also....

Also multiple vaccines coming to market and being used at the same time is not priced fully imo
Pretty regular occurrence, just like the US and SK running war games near the NK dmz
Why we pumping monday?
Yeah but I‚Äôm fine with a $700 return on every $1100 I put in and this way if it goes wrong I don‚Äôt lose money until it dips under $8 I‚Äôm trying to climb my way out of -60% so I have to play it safe
Bro. I have spent more on fucking roblox for my daughter than all my gaming systems combined. This shit is a goldmine.

Just let me sell the weed eater and I'll fix everything
ahhh i see. I didn‚Äôt even know they delayed it that long. Could it be possible they are afraid of a pump and dump? 

I‚Äôve actually played this game a lot when i was younger and i truly do believe it has a very good business model around in game currency , jobs, creativity etc

The concept of home sharing as an alternative to hotels is, generally speaking, a big deal. AirBnB essentially created (or rather significantly expanded) an entirely new marketplace.

I‚Äôd love to be a part of that.

And, you know, this idea of people making money from sharing their homes is a huge new economic opportunity for a lot of individuals that simply didn‚Äôt exist before.
Because it‚Äôs not their choice, it‚Äôs the government‚Äôs choice if they want to let them be audited to the US‚Äôs liking.

Are you serious? I‚Äôve made like 200% on mine.  But most of my leaps were July/August.  I sold most today my shares March 23rd ü§¶üèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

Selling covered calls on the leaps is the way to go. Not sexy, but gets a nice 0.25% a week.

ABNB will go down eventually. Lock up period and shorts. Maybe not dipping that much now but many people believes it is way too overpriced. Your $3500 will temporarily hold the stock price.

I need some confirmation bias on my NIO calls. So much negative catalysts lately and my account is bleeding. Still up 700% ytd but it still hurts. Do we see a recovery? I'm holding 50c 1/15/21.

Thank you autist gods for the SPAC bubble went from down 60% to down 28% and it keeps shrinking
Yes
Ah, I gotcha. Yea I bought my X5 used.. I saw an 18 model at a local dealer with 30k miles for 32k. It was super nice,  but itll maybe only be worth 20k in 2 years if you don't stack a shitload of miles on it.

CarGurus is a great site to use.. as well as just checking out local dealerships to see what they've gotten for trade ins

Also, my experience with BMW service and support has been top notch. They gave me a brand new one to drive around when my last car had a recall. They picked up my car at work and left a new one sitting in the parking lot

I know I'm really shilling for BMW, but after owning one, Ill always have one. Drives unlike any other car I've driven, and I've driven a lot of sports cars

is the NAV is 10. do i need to sign anything or will my shares just be bought back if it dips below 10?
I don‚Äôt proclaim to be an expert on it but the fact they delayed the IPO until next year after ABNB DASH & AI all went up like 100% is a really bad sign...

Probably couldn‚Äôt get enough money at the right price?
This was the quietest IPO ever

Nice
I have a connect with a company that sales shares PRE-IPO, you just gotta have a least 25k to put down.  Kicking myself for missing the opportunity to get ABNB@$68/share.  I put in orders at $80/share like a peasant in robinhood on ipo day, lol.

Looking to capitalize on the next hype meme and buy 25k worth of shares pre-ipo.  What IPO's do you foresee having a lot of hype around them?

>Good morning everyone. Last night I did some analysis on $ABNB. I think this company is a potential tenbagger. AirBnB currently has 20% of the market share but I think it could have 200%. I calculated this by multiplying by 10. This gives me a price target of $1,450. See below:
No news. But tits will go up on Monday. Trust me
I‚Äôm gonna get ones that expire 6 month out. Hoping dash goes up some more before puts are available.

ABNB definitely ain‚Äôt dipping that much. Just spent another $3500 on there last night. The holidays are the their biggest quarter and 2020 set a low bar so 2021 will be mega growth year over year

You may have to reevaluate your timeline once we know how long the vaccine is effective for. Its unclear how long it will or will not provide protection. So the idea of herd immunitty is likely to be more elusive. March seems really unlikely.
How much
No clue but following as I am curious who you guys think is out.

Sell covered calls ya dummy. It‚Äôll lower your cost basis so you can make some/all of that money back. The 12/18 30c are priced at like 84 a piece (assuming Robinhood‚Äôs pricing isn‚Äôt shit, which it is). If you sell 2 covered calls at that strike, you‚Äôve made back a third of your current losses. Do that 3 times and boom, your loss is gone. You accept no additional downside risk than you already have. Your only ‚Äúrisk‚Äù is missed profits if it shoots up above your strike, but even if that happened, you would still be up 200 plus your premium.

Digital revenue sharing agreements is a start. I‚Äôd personally rather pay for this free cash flow at dirt cheap prices than 200x sales for the snowflakes and Tesla‚Äôs of the world. It‚Äôs ok to be bearish on a struggling company but this isn‚Äôt the same GameStop that we saw paying a $0.38 a quarter dividend while declining revenue and crippling debt. The billionaires got involved because they saw value. With the low debt now and strong cash flow and all the cash on hand. They could pivot to be anything honestly, or rebrand entirely. Couple that with the influx of revenue that they are getting this quarter they will be well positioned to make a move. I‚Äôm not trying to convince you to buy it. Just expressing why I like it so much and so far it‚Äôs been the right move almost tripling my money on a few months while the short sellers keep piling in. The call they had for Q3, they said this upcoming quarter will be the best they‚Äôve had in years. Not sure why I would sell on that level of strength. Until demand for the consoles slow or Ryan Cohen throws in the towel on a take over. The opportunity risk is too great.
Actually most of the time flippers buy houses with very few problems, fix them up marginally, and then jack up the prices.

Thank you for taking the time to respond to me. How does demand/supply influence the price of options? I thought the valuation of options happens based on the Black Scholes equation where supply/demand is expressed by Sigma.

Also, to calculate the price of options in the future I've used https://www.optionsprofitcalculator.com/ thus far. However it has its limitations, such as where premiums can only be calculated for time = now. I have looked online for more profound calculators but could not find any, really. What is everyone else using?
Yeah because markets made total sense before robinhood.

The real bubble is indexing, because it destroys price discovery of individual companies and is ultimately dependent on unsustainable perpetual population growth to achieve returns

Edit:

>‚ÄúThe simple theses and the models that get people into sectors, factors, indexes, or ETFs and mutual funds mimicking those strategies ‚Äì these do not require the security-level analysis that is required for true price discovery,‚Äù Burry said in a recent interview with Bloomberg.

>‚ÄúThis is very much like the bubble in synthetic asset-backed CDOs before the great financial crisis in that price-setting in that market was not done by fundamental security-level analysis, but by massive capital flows,‚Äù Burry continued.

>This first point seems to be the one that subject matter experts, generally speaking, find more troubling.

>‚ÄúI think that Dr. Burry is 100% correct, which is very unusual for someone in the ETF industry to say,‚Äù says Phil Bak, the founder and CEO of Exponential ETFs.

>‚ÄúRunning a DCF or securities valuation analysis has not been rewarded in recent years while the market‚Äôs moved away from the value factor,‚Äù Bak says. ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs hurt price discovery. There‚Äôs no question that it‚Äôs hurt price discovery.‚Äù


>Shyam Sunder, an economics professor at Yale University, has been studying issues like price discovery, efficient markets and high-frequency trading for over three decades. He thinks the trillions flooding into passively managed funds may be distorting prices.

>‚ÄúIf 5% or 10% of the market is invested in indexes, I don‚Äôt think it makes much of a difference. But once that percentage becomes high ‚Äì 40%, 50% or higher, then obviously it begins to have an effect,‚Äù Sunder says.

It's already at 20%, and this is enough to distort prices and affect price discovery, especially if it's a growing source of inflows.

>‚ÄúPrice discovery is what we call a public good, like a broadcast signal from a radio station. The question is, who should pay for it?‚Äù Sunder says. ‚ÄúEverybody benefits from an informed market, but the cost of informing the market is paid by people who do the hard work.

>‚ÄúPrice discovery cannot take place if Shyam doesn‚Äôt do any homework ‚Äì doesn‚Äôt do any digging, has no expertise, doesn‚Äôt learn about the products and competition and price and technology of the firm, and just says, ‚ÄòOh! The price of this firm should not be $50, it should be $75,‚Äô‚Äù he says.

Inflows into passive funds are massive and are already big enough for the tail to wag the dog. It's compounded by "closet indexing":

>Index funds not only follow indexes, but encourage active managers to stay close [compositionally] to the index, a phenomenon called ‚Äúcloset indexing,‚Äù where investors pay for active management but get index-like results because the fund company fears shareholder reaction if returns deviates sharply from the benchmark.

With respect to price discovery, Nikkei may not have appreciated much over the past three decades but if you picked the right stocks (price discovery), you'd have done very well. 


And for people who think indexes aren't distorting markets- 

(1) you fucking boomers don't actually trade so you have no idea the difference in trading e.g. LOW vs HD 

(2) Tesla over the past month and into next week

Finally, why should the entire market go up over time? Demand growth, and inflation. In stable countries, both of these result from population tending to increase over time. This is ultimately not sustainable, and given patterns in developed nations, population growth is unlikely to continue without massive replacement immigration (usually from poorer countries that may not share the host country's values or culture), and it's a question of how crowded and degraded an environment, society and lifestyle we allow ourselves before we say enough is enough. 

This is why we to colonize offworld I suppose- corporate profits require it.

if you want go long, load up on as many shares as you can and try to use multiples of 9 to max out the free warrants you'll get. don't buy warrants now like a fucking moron and get your ass blown out when the tontine warrants are distributed and the supply of them goes up by 200%

you can also sell puts if you don't like the current price and think it might come back down. selling a $25 strike put and getting assigned on it in the event of a dip gives you a cost basis that's far more attractive than the current share price

Only thing I dislike is the chart and how it didn't find a base at 34-35.  Seems there are still plenty of people worried that it was just a stay-at-home Covid play, though I completely disagree.  It may take February's earnings report to wake people up, so I plan to buy it again before then if it's still low.

The amount of people that think of this company as only keyboards/mice really proves the undervaluation, their power supplies and rgbs are some of the most popular on the market, ask any PC gamer easily 9/10 will recommend Corsair parts for a new build.

Is it too late to get in on Disney calls?
This is a joke company they had so many years and still fail.
And people believe they will send many of them up and actually make money?
Maybe they launch some celebrities up in four years, killing Leonardo Di Caprio.
Ahhh gotcha. They are certainly putting a lot of effort into that. People speculated they were trying to stall losses until after year end, but it seems like they may try to keep this going indefinitely. Little baffled as to what their exit strategy is, as they have to eventually, and they're paying horrible interest in the meantime
Elaborate young autist, maybe the force is strong with this one üëÄ
Their trails included people who were infected before. Creating a stratified sample that excludes previously infected is not the good statistics there. You need 328x70%, and 95% effective rate would bring the number to about 242 million vaccinated. This is assuming a lot. Like freezers hold up, ppl come back for 2nd dose 21 days later. Annnnd you have to exclude children, pregnant women and ppl with allergies (it‚Äôs not clear yet which specifically). 

TLDR. Very unlikely by March.
Small, consistent wins over a long period using a tested strategy with positive expectancy and...what the fuck am I saying YOLO that shit on TSLA

The same could be said for Kmart, Sears, JC Penney, GNC, Blockbuster, Montgomery Wards etc. 

The thing you need to look at in a company is scale, growth and profit margin. GME is closing hundreds of stores a year, they‚Äôre scaling backward instead of up and they‚Äôre not making money. Their margin is -2% and they are hemorrhaging money by the millions. 

I just think you should realize that gme is a better way to lose money than make it. AND there are soo many other companies out there that can make you money right now that are actually GROWING.

Edit: Pha$$gots out here downvoting you when puts was the smarter play. A successful launch was mostly priced in anyway which is why I took profits and bailed on my calls.

No, used unsettled funds too many times
Wasn't a catastrophic failure or anything and their contingency plan for the scenario (rocket issue after releasing the vehicle at altitude) seemed to go smoothly. I imagine there will be a dip but I think everyone expects launch failures especially early on, and in this case they didn't lose anything other than time. So I imagine the stock will not get hit too hard over next week.

Also I do not have any position in SPCE

Last time tsla was at 380 was October 30 before the presidential election when the entire market had taken a big dive for a while and before the sp500 announcement.

Pfizer and Moderna are both 2 shot vaccines.  We can estimate 22.5 million will be vaccinated per month from Pfizer and Moderna supplies.  They will both deliver 45 million doses per month (assuming no ramp up in production and no manufacturing issues).  So roughly 67.5 million by the end of February.  22.5 million vaccinated by end of December, 22.5 million vaccinated by end of January and 22.5 million vaccinated by end of February:  22.5 + 22.5 + 22.5 = 67.5.  I'm retarded though so my math be be off.

The losses outweighs the profits when people no longer want to buy your options at the same price or higher than you because there simply isn't enough theta value left, buying ITM calls 1 day before earnings is quite common in this sub with weeklies/monthlies.

https://www.latimes.com/politics/la-pol-ca-california-property-taxes-elites-201808-htmlstory.html

This is a quick intro.
I feel pretty confident for the Monday bounce at least. The market is now sitting overall flat since December 1st, at some point it will likely eke out  some gains for the month unless we have some new unexpected event. Could see some selling next week though before a low volume EOY finish.
But if I recall, "natural born" isn't very well defined which is why John McCain (born in Panama) and Ted Cruz (born in Canada) have been able to run for president.

I'm sure there are plenty on here that have experienced much worse, but I just started trading equities about 4 months ago and up until this week had been making about 3 grand a week, which was plenty to turn my focus from job hunting after a covid layoff. This week I lost all of my gains plus some (about $18k in total). Started killing it with options in November and just got in over my head this week with calls on $MGNI, $LAZR, $BBY, $MU, $NKE, $PBR, $GLUU...(feel like an idiot just typing them now.) Kept convincing myself they'd turn up tomorrow...they did not.

So now my account is below 25k so I don't know wtf to do this week other than get out of those positions -several of which expire 12/18 and pray that the 1/15s and a few of my share holdings turn around. 

So now I'm about to go Christmas shopping with the wife and she has no idea I fucked up so bad and lost a bunch of the cash we had been saving to buy a house. Ill try to slyly be using credit cards instead of debit cards to pay for shit for the kids. FML man...

Look at the all time chart and then the 1 year. It‚Äôs clearly been heading downward the past 10 years, but could the last 3 months may be the start of a new long term upward trend?

Commenting for later reading.
while this is somewhat true, Pfizer isn't the only company with these resources, so there is absolutely no guarantee that they will be the mRNA player of the future. BioNtech might license their other pipeline assets with completely different big pharma companies. 

If you want to bet on mRNA vaccines, you need to look at the biotech level of the value chain, rather than the pharma level, and evaluate their discovery tech platform to make a prediction on who will be the future winners.

But it also means that democrats have the majority in House and Senate as well as holding the executive office, which would mean they could pass much more liberal policy. Which will probably mean more taxes and more regulations. So I would expect that Wall Street would be bearish on that news in the short term.

There is hardly any downside risk. As soon as the Fed's stop loss hits, they will inject even more liquidity into the market. Just keep buying long dated OTM calls.

Nah. Top concerns are price, longevity, range, and being nickle-and-dimed for software (the new expensive maintenance).      
       
Range is third, and charging is only a concern because range is relatively low compared to ICE vehicles. No one actually cares about charging because it takes too damn long and everyone knows that. People either want to charge at home over night or not have to deal with it at all. Even if everyone could charge at every single parking spot in the country, people would still just charge at home over night 99.9999% of the time. No one wants to wait 15-30 minutes at a charging station -- regardless of their location.

Looks like they aborted just after releasing the rocket vehicle from the ascent vehicle (not sure what the accepted lingo for the vehicles/launch process is). But the rocket vehicle safely landed. Don't think there is any more information yet

Why don't you sell? Am retarded as well. Pls don't mind the name.

Yes. I have children I enjoy spending time with
Yep. There will be a bounce back from the panic selling, then likely a descent again as the reality is that the start of commercial operations is likely to be getting impacted now. Bear in mind that this test was supposed to be end of autumn, so we're already behind on the business timeline.

Wait until all the data comes out. We have all day today and tomorrow to let the market digest exactly what happened. Ask that question again around bedtime tomorrow. Any answer you get now is pure speculation, no matter the source.
Sounds like something Robinhood would send in notifications not realizing it‚Äôs a weekend
Lmaoooo good thing I scooped SPCE puts, shit was overpriced but with this failure hopefully goes back down to 15$ and I buy back in
It‚Äôs priced in. Pfizer was a buy maybe 8-10 months ago
Your taxes aren‚Äôt going to increase buddy- stop playing into the fear. Nobody is raising taxes in a freaking recession heading towards a depression.. unless of course you are a bizzillionaire you got nothing to worry about.

Rip my $35 calls.....

Edit: Fat chance they launch again today or tomorrow, but if it happens we might get lucky. From Twitter they didn‚Äôt say they wouldn‚Äôt try again. They said they had extra engines, so pray. Lol just pray. If I lose the money on the calls I just double down and buy in the dip that‚Äôs going to happen.

You turned roughly $16k to $18k in a year. 

There are 252 business days in a year, so you made about $7.93 per day.

Slow, steady ascent then back down very quickly. How appropriate.
Abortion it‚Äôs not like it killed our calls but it‚Äôs kinda like are calls are dead. Man I need some new Louis CK material to make me feel better
Well Pfizer's vaccine represents a much smaller fraction of the company's current and future revenue stream...while a covid vaccine would be the first approved product of MRNA and NVAX (i.e. 100% of current revenue stream and more than 50% of revenue stream through the next few years).

They announced the vaccine approval way too early Monday won‚Äôt be a gap up because of it üòû
Yes. They said they wanted to grow more. 

It can be argued both ways. Going public would give them the capital they need to build out right away. And clearly they wouldn‚Äôt confirm if they were going public prior to an official announcement anyway. But, who knows, maybe they want to sit it out until the market cools down and we‚Äôre in the next recession in 3 years. Possibilities are endless.
I stand corrected only the philly locations permanently closed
Can you use that Free stock for a berkshire Hathaway stock?
Just a bunch of fucking retards
This shit has been priced in for a while. Literally every human has known this would be approved.
Property taxes here in Texas is how they fuck you.
I don‚Äôt see too much being done on taxes while we‚Äôre in a pandemic recession
no idea, but anyone who would commit a significant portion of their assets to single biotech stock, arguably the most volatile and most prone to binary events of any sector, without understanding the following things probably needs to get burned and learn a lesson

a) the entire business model of small cap biotech is to dangle the prospect of a cure in front of the lemmings' faces to keep them hopeful while the corporate vultures loot the coffers. they don't care about curing a disease, they care about getting bought out by Roche

b) the way they do this is by taking drugs that have no history of working, giving them new names, pumping up their stock price on early data and exiting before the drug fails its next trial, and then moving on to the carcass of a new company
They'll have to troubleshoot, and then install a new rocket motor. The ship is designed to do that within a week, but I don't know if they're prepared right now for that operation. Doubtful, especially with reduced manpower because of covid.
Only after you've left the job. Still at the job.

The market will have a bull run as long as interest rates are zero and no one expects Biden to pursue corporate tax increases in the middle of a pandemic
WAAAAAAAGH
Sell limit order on mine as soon as it‚Äôs green; and then puts spce is going to take a shit... it was a dumb idea in the first place.
I bought 49c leaps
Definitely depends. The move are usually pretty decent, my keyboard luck was abysmal by comparison.
Yeah the best combo for stonks rn would be republican led senate and democratic house with Biden as president

It would start making sense if the Robinhood app used üëçüëéinstead of "Buy" and "Sell" buttons.

People don't look at fundamentals because they are not available in the Robinhood app.  Too much work to find them elsewhere.  Much easier to just smash that like button because you like the way a company's logo looks.

I dont even want to know what you did to earn yours sir
What about buying ITM calls 1 day before earnings and closing after market open? eg. buying JBL 40c 18/12 on 16/12 when they publish 17 BMO and close immediately at market open on the 17th?  I get that Theta will dig into any potential profits, a company can post good earnings and still not move, or move in the opposite direction etc. But I still dont see how the losses should outweigh the profits
Lol you calls just got aborted
It's kind of lame there can't just be a universal framework

They‚Äôre especially tight around this time. Too many dumb asses ruin it for the people who know what they‚Äôre doing. They‚Äôre just trying to protect their money.
The more I think about it I actually think this is a good thing, maybe it was a test for an emergency situation ... I‚Äôd feel good as a customer watching this thing land safely after it obviously has an issue , IDK! Maybe just trying to make me feel better about my calls
Just stop bro
Only 1/3 of my portfolio. Nbd.
All calls have a chance of going down in flames. 

But SPCE calls have a chance of going down in flames, literally.

Just sell a covered call at 20% OTM. That'll make the stock run up immediately.
so now the only thing that can move the overall market in the short term is 1. stimulus (bullish) and 2. dems winning both GA (bearish)

Edit: it has come to my uninformed attention that there may be some problems with these graphs.
Because when the trial 3 data got announced anyone taking the bet that it would get approved got in. It‚Äôs been a forgone conclusion for literally weeks.  Also the retail bubble mania is starting to become exhausted. Also you picked the large conglomerate and not the meme friendly moderna.
I‚Äôm good. I sold all my spce after that rocket crashed a few days ago
I guess distributing and creating a vaccine in under a year to an entire country just isn‚Äôt good enough for the stock market these days
Yeah since this is not in EV sector. I don't expect Twitter and WSB to take up until this hits 15$ already. Just like BFT$, people are waking up now to it.
It should have been the Doctors/the frontline workers. Sadly, we failed AGAIN at identifying the true saviors!

Why do banks hate house flippers I have great credit good income & 25% down but the bank says flipping is risky so they would charge me 15% interest I flipped 2 houses made 45k & 35k so I guess I have to keep using my money I buy undervalued places so why are banks such tight controlling jerks

Exactly. Rkt was pump and dump by WSB. Don't buy a spac past 10-13 dollars. Too much gamble imo. Just wait before merger and sell it.

>then the fed raises rates in 2023 and market is -20%.

It fell 20% in 2018 and we weren't in a bubble back then lol

Also keep in mind the market was still bleeding out hard at the time and -20% was where it stopped ONLY because JPow bent over to the market and said he was reverting all the rate hikes and stopping QT.

This shit can easily tank 50%+ on rate hikes + an end of QE, which is the exact reason why those will never happen. The fed couldn't even stomach 20% down, how will they be able to stomach at least 50%?
You called it. Failed launch and the retard deleted his post. Some users on this sub are pathetic as fuck u/joey_tv_show enjoy that fat dip Monday.

$SPCE shareholders, you understand that this means Virgin Galactic has had an almost fully successful flight. The abort will be looked into and researched, then it will be fixed for next launch. Plus there was a fully successful landing even with abort. Panic sell will happen Monday. Buy the dip.
Honestly they‚Äôre mostly just sales

Maybe I didn't get your question right, you're asking if its profitable to buy a contract that's OTM with 1-2 day expiry to profit off of earnings right?

In a sense you're basically asking if buying FDs are a profitable long term strategy?

When you buy an option, you're paying for premiums + rights for to buy 100 shares at a certain price point and date. When your contract expires, your options are either exercised or closed worthless. For it to be exercised you must have enough cash in your account and for the price to be at break even. 

So let's say you load up on 5 $40 calls on a $39 stock the day before earning. You have paid about $1500 in premiums 

Congratulations. The stock has now reached $42. But your original purchase has a premium. So to break even, each share must reach:
$1500/500 +$40 =$43

For you to break even.

Okay let's say it's at $44 then. Your price has now broken even. Now two things will happen:

A: someone will buy from you an option with only 0-1 day expiry at the price of $40

B: the contract expires in the money and you will be automatically assigned 500 shares at $40 each.


Here's the turned off part, 90%  of options expire worthless. And by the 0-1 day the theta decay would had been so bad that no one would buying. So you better make sure that you have $20000 in your account to buy the shares else the contract would had expired without assignment. This varies different from brokers so be sure to ask them.

If you're playing around earnings. The common strategy I seen this sub would be to buy monthlies. But remember. Theta is a bitch, those post that you see on this sub turning 4000 to 1mill are playing around ITM leaps (atleast most that I know)

Hey man, just some advice if you want to follow it. I‚Äôve been there and done that, not to that extent but you still have a chance. Start small and work your way up I.e. scalability. Go to your local 7/11 and start sucking some dicks and eating some asses. The more you do it, the better you get at it and eventually you can expand your business and client base. 

Good luck and I wish you the best!

Real talk if FDs become an addiction and you keep on losing money - you shouldn't be F'ing with FDs. If you can control yourself, take that money and buy a bunch of ETFs or literally buy random stocks with it. Your wealth will grow. If you can't control yourself set up and IRA or something along those lines which automatically deducts a set about amount every month. With your salary you should be able put in at least a few hundred a month. Again your wealth will grow. Not everyone can be autie-go-lucky and pick 3 letters and a date then suddenly get 5000% return.

Thats complicated, I have bought and sold hundreds of calls and shares on this stock. Right now I have 100x April calls from 15c to 30c and 1500 shares.

I've been doing this since July but didn't get deeply invested until it hit 10. For now I'm sitting on the April calls and selling weekly CCs on the shares.

Exit strategy won't really be feasible to determine until we see what triggers the next leg up. Squeezes can be long and slow like tesla, or short and explosive like volkswaggen
Hope so might continue to buy the dip

The gaming market is exploding in growth. There will be new revenue streams that we can‚Äôt even imagine of today. The businesses that are nimble enough with low amounts of debt and strong cash flows to invest in the new trends will be able to capitalize on it. GameStop is checking those boxes. I would like to see Cohen take the reigns with his success in online retail but ultimately there are more ways to generate new revenue outside of just retail sales here and I think they will figure it out. I‚Äôm long GME, I bought 2,613 shares at $5.58 so my money has been made already at this point it‚Äôs icing on the cake. I like the tend I‚Äôm seeing on this turn around. Honestly, I like that there is still so much pessimism on the name because it keeps everything in check. The biggest worry was will they go bankrupt. They‚Äôve proved they won‚Äôt by generating enough cash to keep creditors away and the debt they do have left is trading nicely. The next step is to get back to a profit which they will in Q4 then use the profits to invest in growth. Even with no squeeze I think this will be an interesting company to be apart of.

Netflix has somewhere near 200 million subscribers and is at about $500/share.  Disney in about a year already has 80 million - not to mention their sports teams, theme parks, marvel, films, etc.  Obviously, with theaters going belly up, we don't know what the future holds for film revenues, but I'd say that their company is going to massively boost over the next few years.

Gravity never ends, no matter how high you go, even to the space station. In the space station, they're still falling towards the earth, but they're also moving horizontally so fast across the surface of the earth that by the time they fall far enough, they're on the side of the planet and there's no ground to hit. They're in constant freefall AROUND the earth. Orbit is a matter of speed, not height.

What SpaceShipTwo does is a little different. It just goes up and gravity brings it down. The thing, however, is that it doesn't have the horizontal speed to get into an orbit.

The reason there's no gravity on the space station, however, is the same reason there's no gravity in SpaceShipTwo. People inside the craft are freely/independently rising/falling at the exact same speed as the spacecraft itself. This is unlike an airplane, where the plane keeps you at the same altitude, even though gravity is trying to pull you down through the floor.

FEELING gravity is just a matter of the sum of the forces acting upon your body.

This x1000. I found it hilarious that people praise EV as some sort of engineering miracle. The modern ICE car is complicated as fuck compared to EV.

The only reason why Toyota hasn't gone full EV is simply because demand for ICE car is still there, infrastructure for charging the EVs aren't here (just look at all the cars parked outside. Imagine having a fucken charging plug for all the cars out in public wires running everywhere, its just simply not  happening.), and as soon as you get 50/50 ICE/EV the demand for batteries will outstrip what suppliers can handle and price for batteries will 20x.

Tesla is lucky that other manufacturers haven't pushed their EV line up yet as they'll cannibalize the batteries currently available. Otherwise Tesla's model 3 will be selling at 150k with the battery itself costing 120k per pack.
Probably cashed out, they set $20 PT and hit it

It means that the recent price increase already included the hype for approval, in this case. A small bump may happen but it won't surge to anything exciting. So new news on the vaccine that it got approved won't increase it because the news previously was so note worthy that it was obvious to those investors then it would get approved sooner or later so that was "priced in".

In other words, initial surge from "X" news being released includes the surge for hype for later news because it's a given then that the later news would come sooner or later. Big investors got it in early and left behind the small  retail investors.

Oh wait, my mistake. They added 1.7M shares this week, they currently have 4.55m shares. So at 2.8m shares the 1.7m to bring them to 4.55m would be roughly a 60% increase in their position.
So why the fuck are my X 20c 1/15 negative?? Did I buy at the peak? They just made an acquisition but people sold off. Will my calls be worth anything???

I think you're missing it - they closed out their July 2021 puts that they bought in October, I believe it was shortly after the MSFT partnership spike, and rolled them forward to January expiry. We know that GME will announce holiday sales and they present at the ICR conference jan11-14, so it's a bold move by Melvin to try and keep the stock down for that expiry.

Buy stock, sell covered calls at 40 for June. Cost is ~2200. 

Scenario 1: spacman fails, you get 20 bucks back, downside of 10%. (unlikely) 

Scenario 2: spacman kinda wins and merger lands in the 30s, you keep stock and any gains and some sucker on wsb is out 350. (most likely) 

Scenario 3: it's a unicorn and spacman got a great deal and stock doubles to 40+. You get to double your money in 6 months time and I know the retards here will screech and say it could've been more but realistically how much more because it'd have to rise above 44 to lose out on gains. You could also just roll the option further out if you'd rather not have your stock called away. (unlikely) 

Ultimately it's about risk tolerance and I'd say this is about as safe as it gets for psth. 

You can do a similar play selling March 30calls if you're an impatient fker.

I filed for it like oct 15 this year asking for approval for this year but I have a feeling they gonna tell
Me to fuck off.  Figured it was worth a try we'll see if they allow it as what I read said they are strict about it needing to be filed with your extension on april 15.  I didn't file an extension and filed my taxes in oct.  But even with all my clean wash sales my realized pnl is pretty close to the amount I realized.

My oldest son who just turned 4 was listening to Christmas music and that dumb "I want a hippopotamus for Christmas" song came on.

Mostert has a tough matchup cuz Wash d line is the real deal...Snell looked like ass against them in the Pitt game but then again Snell is just ass...Duke also has a tough matchup against Chicago (Akiem Hicks is back) but might get the benefit of game script if Hou stomps all over the poor Bears.

Tough one, I‚Äôd say Mostert has more potential ceiling if you trust Shanahan to scheme him some big runs. It‚Äôs a real tossup, so I‚Äôd say go with the better team overall (9ers)

But better to not expect great guns from either

Also, it's old news anyway. Anybody with a brain already knew PFE would be the company to produce a vaccine for the US quite some time ago... just a matter of when. Even if some smaller company was ahead of them in research, Pfizer would just buy up anything that looked promising approaching trials and any sort of approval.

Logically sure, but I won't bet against the Mouse.

Yeah, I mean come on, folks. You have to ask yourself if its possible that if a company ended up merging, is it possible that the CEO trolled on twitter in the middle of negotiations. The tech saver young CEO made a tweet for fun. Like this is just negotiating. And the losses IPOs like SNOW and ABNB have suffered, that isn't going anywhere in 2 years when they go public. A 20% stake to Ackman here would be the smartest thing they've ever done. Access to capital via investors like Klarman, Guggenheim and ONT who just don't leave positions easily.

But it might not be stripe, you're right.

Just like GILD didn't move when their anti-viral was given approval to treat COVID.

People in America are already a bunch of anti vax retards so I think uptake on the vaccine will be poor, until it becomes mandatory for certain activities or jobs.

I didn‚Äôt say charging at home was a fringe case. You‚Äôre right that the majority of EV owners currently charge at home, but the EV market is only 3% of sales. If this market is going to grow to projections, they need to solve customer concerns that are currently preventing wider adoption. Charging and range are 2 of the top 3 concerns preventing new buyers (3rd being cost). If everyone could charge at home and took infrequent longer trips, these wouldn‚Äôt be concerns because EVs solve this really well already. If you think that I‚Äôm arguing that my current experience is the ‚Äúright‚Äù experience, you‚Äôve missed my point(s) - which are that charging infrastructure needs to accommodate a variety of experiences, long range cars won‚Äôt fully solve the issue, and 80% of the US population lives in urban areas.

Although it may go up to hype, CRSR and its major competitor LOGI both have the same price to fcf ratio of about 23 - reasonable in a rationale market, but greatly below market averages right now (TSLA at 316 lol).

So I believe if CRSR rises LOGI will rise, but who has the bigger total addressable market? CRSR is best in class for computer components, and has increased their yoy revenue on their peripherals (keyboards, mouse etc) substantially over the past couple of years. I still believe CRSR is a good buy at the price right now, but I don't think its quite as scalable as tech stocks for example. Also who besides top gamers buy new peripherals/computer components every year? Shits dumb expensive and a lot of people wait to buy 1 generation old components to save on money.

I still believe LOGI remains king here because as businesses go back to going to offices or business offer current and new employees funds to purchase office equipment to wfh, a majority of gen pop buyers will be going with Logitech.

Just my 2 cents.

I work in Agriculture for a firm that develops and manages grower access to seeds based on genetic resistance to disease pressure in different regions. Main focus is Sugar Beets and Barley.

When I was lab assistant for a pathology lab at a land grant university, it was constantly discussed amongst the PHD's.

Honestly it usually takes me about 2-3 months to fall asleep naturally when I quit/ take a break from smoking. If you can find the will or motivation to do even a little light exercising with any frequency it is a huge help. But I know I struggle staying on the "fitness will fix it" train. If sleep is hard to snag and you >need< it, go to a pharmacy and grab a sleep aid - I can't recommend them enough. I think it is called Walsom at Walgreens; any night where I know I can fit a solid 8 hours in I'll take two of them. If you want a more natural solution, I found that CBD gummies work really well (SunsetCBD sells a giant can of gummie bears on Groupon for like, $50 bucks); you can take 2 or 3 of these. Also I find that getting into at least 1 relaxing habit before bed like taking a hot shower with candles instead of the overhead, reading a book instead of watching tv, or making a cup of tea to have while you watch your last Netflix show of the night. I really hate routines, but they save me from myself.

It‚Äôs fine to have noob questions. Options have implied leverage, and the best way to explain this is an example:

You buy a 15Jan21 220 call on Visa, priced at 1.98 and delta of .21

.21 x 100(206.24) = $4331.04 notional, or an implied leverage of ~22 on your initial purchase. If Visa spikes, gamma and Vega drive the delta higher which amplifies the implied leverage as it moves up.

Suddenly a few percentage point movement can double or quadruple an options position, if not more. That‚Äôs how implied leverage works for options.
Would you like an apple pie with that?

You ever start to take a piss then you feel a turd poking through and then think about all the time you lost when you could have just sat down and got them both out?
when we inevitably have the story about how poorly the distribution of the vaccine goes, not because it's really going to go that badly, but because it's a really big and complicated system, and it's the government doing it, I believe palantir is going to be the Fall Guy for it.

The other reason that the distribution is going to go poorly is because demand is going to be through the roof and supply is going to be hampered, and if people need two doses I think that it is going to very quickly be a situation where there's a lot of people that feel they should have it when it's not available to them. And it'll be coming easy story for news outlets to say oh the government screwed another thing up. It's easy for them because they can show "victims" all day long. Any sort of a human interest piece that will easily give them people for the screen is going to be a story.

You can‚Äôt price in a ton of shares being bought. Those shares still need to be bought. Creating upward pressure. I‚Äôve made a ton shorting stocks that have lockup expirations happening, and every time I try to tell WSB about them someone will comment how it‚Äôs ‚Äúpriced in‚Äù. As though you can price in a ton of shares all hitting the market at once wanting to sell.

Airbnb is not just the name of the company, but also the name of the action.  When someone thinks of renting out their place, they don't say let's vrbo it.  When someone thinks let's search for alternatives to hotels, they say let's airbnb it.

Hopefully airbnb can fix it's scam feeling.  As a buyer, seeing advertised prices double by checkout is terribly off putting.  

Hopefully airbnb can follow Amazon's lead with customer first focus.  The customer being the renter.  Since airbnb is already the market leader for short term renters, they can clamper down on landlord abuse like excessive cleaning fees, etc.  

Airbnb is already past the point of needing to onboard more landlords.  At this point they should just focus on the buyers experience.  Similar to amazon treating it's sellers like crap, the sellers still sell on amazon because that is where the buyers are.

Airbnb just needs to focus on making the tenant experience the best it can possibly be.  Squeeze the landlords, they'll have nowhere else to go.

To be fair, this bubble really started in 2016, and has only been sustained by extreme liquidity intervention and near-zero interest rates/elevated default risk. It took slashing interest rates and a $2T stimulus commitment to stall the last panic sell, and the rally of core Nasdaq and S&P stocks was heavily influenced by irregular options activity and lower-than-expected bottom line impacts of coronavirus as reflected by beats of relatively bearish earning guidance in a lot of cases. There has also been massive retail volume uptick over the summer that I expect to dry up relatively soon as people start to question if the top is in. The house of cards is piled high already. I question how long this can be sustained even with the present level of liquidity support, and I'm pretty worried about market sensitivity to a major catalyst like a China-Taiwan conflict. But I'm a üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüêª, so maybe I'm wrong and am gonna miss out on SPY $500 Jan 2022. We'll see.

I'm no huge fan of the FDA even before all this but the argument is...

Telling them to do their job and make the decision as fast as they safely and confidently can is one thing, telling them to approve a vaccine immediately or lose their job is entirely different.

The public already has a shitty outlook on this vaccine and vaccines in general, no use in making it obvious that a non medically trained white house appointee is pulling the strings on the decisions to put it in you and not the actual people hired to do it that are capable of making that call and FULLY aware of how important it is to do it ASAP.

Either way, I'm first on line for it, fuck this covid shit.

It could be coincidental or maybe yolo got to me but Jackie Reece being at square and resigning now serving on the PSTH maybe a coincidence but a highly striking one nonetheless. Micheal ovitz with his extensive background not least his Horowitz founding experience coincides rather nicely with backers in a certain fintech firm who may find exiting on these terms rather tempting. Ie andreesen Horowitz are backers of stripe. I know JC said no such deal but that maybe then and maybe just deny deny deny until deal is done and announced to world.

Production, trials, and qualification is 95% or more of the work and costs. The formula for the vaccine was done in February. It's fairly easy for a small lab to do that and make very small batches.

The "Dad, How do I?" Channel on YouTube is pretty helpful for a lot of DIY standard household stuff.  My dad worked home construction for 30 years, and that cocksucker never taught me a damn thing in between being physically and mentally abusive.

Sorry, went on a tangent.  Home Depot sometimes has free classes on home DIY, and they're good classes.  Pretty sure they're still doing them, or maybe doing online ones? I'd get a voltmeter and learn how to use it for electrical projects.  Check out that YouTube channel, and good luck my dude.

It‚Äôs lower because it will only be like 5-10% stake in the company.

If you look up quantumscape there was an article warning investors about this. The shares outstanding multiplied like fivefold or something
SPAC shareholders often receive a minority of the company.  So yeah, more shares upon merge.  They are often locked for a duration but not always; depends on the terms.

That merger isn't happening for another month, right?
So you think a company with a market cap of $230,000,000,000, will end up with a market cap of over $400,000,000,000 from a $50 vaccine, with massive logistical issues and massive competition, in less than three months?

holy fuck how the hell did you bounce back from 250k in student loans w/out having graduated med school and becoming a doctor?

since student loans can't even be discharged in bankruptcy, you must have paid them off which means you were able to somehow transition into a six-figure-paying career after dropping out of Caribbean med school.

I wasn't part of any of those conversations but both can be true. IPO is definitely a way for early investors to take profits but it's also possible to be undervalued at the same time. I have no interest in PLTR specifically, but it isn't hard to imagine a hypothetical where a fund like Sequoia dumps at IPO with a valuation of $30 million when they initially invested like $500k for a 20% stake, even if the "true" value of the company is $40 mill. Venture capital is all about finding a bigger buyer, that's it.

Weeklies.
Yeah, I agree there will be a tech pullback as people start spending money on other stuff as well, but I  don't think it will be large. Tech was overvalued before COVID as well, and I think some of that COVID tech spending will be sticky. People who never used Instacart or DoorDash might use it more than they did before COVID. People who bought an Adobe subscription as a way to pass the time in quarantine probably aren't going to massively start canceling, same with the streaming services. For the most part, personal tech spending is done in smaller increments. You probably haven't spent as much on tech services and products this year as you would on a vacation, so when people have things to spend on again, those little $10 subscriptions aren't going to put a big dent in your travel budget, for example. I could see an overall market pullback as people start investing less and spending more (which would sort of offset the pullback).

There's a geographic problem, unfortunately, that's why we have rules about how much water you can take out of rivers. Otherwise the states/companies/people up-stream use up all the water, especially in drought situations.

Globally the bigger concern is the south asia region *(and South Africa, but they're just fucked because their government can't figure out how to build and ration reservoirs properly)*.  In the India/Pakistan region a lot of their rivers are fed by glaciers, which are slowly melting.  These glaciers act as a natural reservoir - saving up water in the form of ice during the cold season and feeding it slowly during the summer as rivers of run-off water.

When the glaciers are exhausted their summers will become a drought with dry rivers and dead crops, mass starvation.  They need to start building man-made reservoirs to collect/conserve/ration their own water before it's too late.

I think a lot of people are missing the actual fact pattern here: Corporate jobs are kinda paying you to stop paying attention to anything that isn't your job. 


People over-paid to perform one kind of research/transaction/sale/task end up with tunnel vision on the metrics of that task and end up not understanding how it interacts with the real world. For instance, proposing a trade without considering that time does kind of exist, lol.
Nobody was killed by taking the vaccine, the 4 reported cases of allergic reaction already recovered and there were only 2 Bell's Palsy cases, and Bell's Palsy is temporary and can be caused by other vaccines and varying factors. Thats 6 cases of adverse side effects out of the 43,661 who participated.

The vast majority of job loss is not salaried people that invest in the market. We are at a point where white collar job loss is about to really kick in, but it‚Äôs still not there yet. The market has always been fueled by investor confidence.  People are still making money and 401ks have to put money somewhere. Along with people continuing to make money, there are tons of people who are sitting higher savings from not having day to day expenses or being able to go on trips. People are chomping at the bit to get on a plane and go on vacation. Yes, a huge percentage of people are out of work, but most of those are from jobs where the consumers returning will pretty immediately cause rapid rehiring. The simple truth is that stocks are not the economy, the people that stocks reflect are still okay and the fed injected a shot of adrenaline into the market that has yet to wear off.

Anecdote: I just met a 29 year old recently who has mortgages on 25 different Airbnb properties. He said that he doesn‚Äôt have much reserve capital in case things go south. What‚Äôs amazing to me is that ABNB holds none of that risk, but reaps much of the reward‚Äîgenius, lol

I‚Äôm a little rusty on my Python, and have been meaning to find a project to de-rusty myself. Yours interests me a bit. Just did a quick look over the code and saved your project. I might be interested in porting it to tda-api (unofficial TDA api Python package). I didn‚Äôt dig deep, but how isolated is the IBKR api code from the algorithm? I‚Äôd prefer to not touch your algorithm if I did work on porting it to tda-api, cause I can handle that I think, but I‚Äôm too trading-retarded to actually write the algorithm of when/what to buy and sell. In your opinion, is this something that is able to be done with the project?

Been doing some DD on a company called Tesla, ticker TSLA. Looks promising, has anyone on here taken a look or seen them mentioned at all?
Muuuuuh shares need this
Fingers crossed my dude
Lol only a person with self esteem issues would think that you need be an aggressive alpha personality to not care about such meaningless things. You know reddits not just english primary speaking users. Do you just assume they are all uneducated because they made a grammatical error that most americans do not get right. Get your head out of your ass, it's reddit, not a thesis.
index managers have front run the inclusion after it was announced.. hence the 50% pop.

Once the inclusion is complete, TSLA will go back down to $200/share in 2021 as VW and Rivian eat up market share, and big autos don't pay carbon credits because they are using them from their own products to reinvest in EV.

I‚Äôm gonna assume you meant ‚Äúwould‚Äôve‚Äù and nah, you‚Äôd pay more on premiums like you would if it was a personal car. The Vin# of the car generally carries the purchase history, and demonstrates the ‚Äúfair‚Äù value.

Yeah and his comments about "optimizations" to save $0.25 weirded me out a little bit. They're cutting prices drastically to avoid competition undercutting them, but worried about a quarter gain per car?  Made me wonder what quality tolerances they're squeezing for inconsequential savings.

Other company valuations have no bearing on GME.

If you're saying bc a lot of the market is overvalued, which I agree, therefore most likely GME would overvalued be too. It's only undervalued relative to it's holdings not to it's growth potential.

The Tesla squeezes are different, there's growth and a catalyst. VW completely different scenario. What is GME going to pivot to to make up that difference? Where do they go from here?

GME needs a catalyst to break out otherwise it's simply going to slide with volatility based on news. There needs to be an upside, forward looking growth past "we sell games and consoles and are used selection of basically free for us besides the cost of shelf space". In fact a lot of the youngest generation isn't even into video games like millennials and Gen X are and are competing with YouTube, twitch and apps for their attention. That's GME's growth market which may not really be there for them come 2030.

There's plays that are likely to double in 2021 but brick and mortar is going to continue to slide. That's my opinion and if you've got cash you want parked in GME, your call and I honestly do wish you luck but I'm going after growth for 2021.

This play is all about the squeeze which may not happen.
Nothing about CRE or EM credit Crisis.

>IATA estimates that the equivalent of 8,000 loads in a 110-ton capacity Boeing 747 freighter will be needed for the airlift

>There are around 2,000 dedicated freighters in use, carrying about half of all goods moved by air. The remainder typically goes in the bellies of the world‚Äôs 22,000 regular jetliners.

>While the freighters are full, air-cargo volume has tumbled this year because so much belly capacity is sitting idle.

Also, this isn‚Äôt necessarily good advice because ‚Äúbuy the rumor sell the news‚Äù it‚Äôs very likely already priced in a since everyone expected it to get approved already.
I‚Äôm gonna load up on puts, nothing makes sense anymore so theyll probably print.
My experience with financial advisors is that most of them are idiots. They basically are just mouthpieces for the chief investment strategy officer for their firm who builds model portfolio allocations and then they charge you 1% to put you in that model. They aren‚Äôt allowed to actually make recommendations outside of that approved model so essentially you can accomplish the same results just by diversifying in ETFs. They are good for people who have no interest in doing their own DD but if you enjoy this stuff and are even average intelligence, do it yourself and just have a good tax guy. I‚Äôve got a bunch of buddies who are advisors and I am smarter than all of them, and I am a retard.
We're all real life financial advisors.

It does. Just in hindsight. 2020 has been fronting profits from years in the future but the actual state of the world can't be avoided forever. Deaths and unemployment equates liquidity problems and a drop in participants.

I took a break from trading really actively and I didn‚Äôt really do much better or worse than when I was buying and selling a lot every day (just a lot less volatile) Pretty easy to have diamond hands when you‚Äôre not checking your account for weeks at a time.

The only thing that happens is that people BET that it is flowing into the market. Driving up prices. But who knows, it could just be sitting in a bank doing nothing.

No, it wouldn't be smart, what strike price would you even go with? There is no way to tell where it's going in this market. You could buy a put as a lotto ticket, but as a way to reliably make money, no. I want to have puts on DASH so bad, but every time I think about what strike and expiry, I have no fucking clue, not even an educated guess because the market is so full of optimism right now, betting on when it will tank is like throwing darts at a board blindfolded.

Last week was a wild fucking ride boys. Got all my trades logged in my journal and looking back at what went right and what went wrong. Here's what happened. 

My biggest winning trades this week: 

* Z put credit spreads (11 Dec 106/105) (18 Dec 111/110): 345 profit
* PLTR lotto play (18 Dec 25 call): 223 profit
* DE iron condor (260/265/252.5/247.5): 105 profit
* TSLA put credit spreads (595/500): 136 profit
* Total: $809 profit

My losing trades that I rolled into this upcoming week:
* AMZN put credit spread (3180/3170): -185
* NVDA put credit spread (535/532.5) - 38
* Total loss: -$147

What I'm holding into next week:
* TSLA put credit spreads (18 Dec 590/585) (24 Dec 595/592.5)
* DE put credit spread: (18 Dec 255/252.2)
* KSU put credit spread (18 Dec 197.5/195)

It ain't much, but I'd rather be consistently making money than the ups and downs that go on here

our larger tech company needed additional capacity for a project so we contracted work out to a couple IBM "dev teams".. They briefly embedded with our existing dev teams to get indoctrinated into our processes and I got a first hand glimpse of how incompetent IBM is if they are allowing those shitbags to be considered devs. Some didn't know git for fuck sake, I was training them the most basic shit and they were to be billing our clients at $200 an hr. Disgraceful, we dropped the contract a month later. How did they even get in the door? Well it turns out they were contractors within IBM, all originating from India.

Bonds and Real Estate have shit returns, where does all the money people make in their 401ks go? It‚Äôs flowing into the market. Yeah, there could be a pull back, but for now, more and more money is going into the market. The more money the fed pours into buying bonds, the more money is available in the economy, this also helps divert big funds into stocks too.
PFE calls are too exp. Even if it goes up the margins aren't there. I'll buy some other cheap shit

I wouldn‚Äôt be surprise if market dumps on this news tbh


I appreciate the reply.

For tax accounting, only some acquisitions are recognized / amortized at all. And likely not the type of acquisition that buys out public company stock, and hence the OP was in fact retarded for using tax offset explanation to say "buy biotech calls."

Morever, under GAAP amortization is rested for impairment. Only private companies can amortize goodwill, and in that case it's an election and ten year amort.

Long term Pfizer will go up because of this. They have demonstrated, for the first time, that an MRNA vaccine is very effective. They did it on the first try, and very quickly. There are other diseases that will benefit from this technology. 

That said, this isn't any good for WSB because it's a long term boomer play.
Dont sleep on the Steelcase (SCS) earnings call being a catalyst for a bump.  

Office furnature company, so obviously slammed by COVID.  Pivoted model to start serving the "work from home" population.  Lots of businesses subsidized employees fixing up their home offices and had existing contracts with them.

https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/09/22/915255953/office-chair-makers-swivel-to-home-market

Last quarter posted a pretty substantial earnings beat and pushed it up over 20%.  Recently flatlined and dropped last week, so I think expeditions are low, any good news will provide something.

April $15c selling for $90 even with earnings call coming up with volume hovering right around the average.  No noise on this one at all, might be a dud, but at the low entry cost and potential upside I'm buying in Monday at open.
Fuck yeah man its the best
I've guessed wrong every time. It's NVAX +7% one day then it's MRNA +9% and then randomly PFE and BNTX hit -1.5%???

Don't worry her with this - she can't change what happened and she may be even more upset than you are. Not necessarily just about the money but with worry about the "problem child" she raised.

However - after you are done being hard on yourself, remember it's just the end of the chapter and not the end of your book.  You clearly have brains and skills and you can recover from this.  Do you have close friends who can be your support group?   Do you have old co-workers who can help refer you to other job openings?

One step at a time.  Learn from your mistakes but forgive yourself.  

You can still show your mom you love her and help her out. It doesn't require money to help with chores,  household repairs, or go on walks in the park. If you don't live nearby, I bet she appreciates phone calls too.
Wait for the acquisition news. No one pumps 2M shares after hours just for the shills.
Yo relax SPCE is a sell the news type thing. Y‚Äôall really think it will run up to $40 because of a test flight?
Yeah I kinda trade the noise.  I try to follow momentum in the 1 min candles.  A lot of what I like to do is find a stock thats trending and wait for the counter trend bounce candle to start going back with the trend.  So like when a stock is going down you find the bounce candle and when the candle starts to turn back down you enter the short and ideally the trend continues.  If your wrong and the market reverses above the top of the candle I would bail.  But on tsla on Wednesday these candles turned into bigger sell offs.  I tend to get fucked on days where stocks don't do shit though and I fail to recognize that.  But that's why I try to stick to stocks with earnings or some sort of news. Or tsla as it tends to have a bit more momentum.

They all have time to plan... and can partner. All those guys get pre negotiation done in the background and then if data confirms what they expect they start burning the money and commit to a launch partner. I‚Äôm not saying don‚Äôt buy PFE I‚Äôm saying your best bet if you‚Äôre looking at the vaccine field is identifying an early stage candidate producing a strong response and place your bet there. mABs will have a place in the picture as well, I haven‚Äôt refreshed myself beyond reading that the cocktails were going to have issues scaling up for worldwide doses.

New investment idea. Something like a REIT but allows you to buy a piece of a big ass pile of guns.

What about it. Looks flat.
Retard
Modified to satisfy the autonazi

I'm gonna do a little retard TA on the [redacted]

If you look at the dotcom it looks like the market was going along nice, normal until about 1000. Then the whole thing shifted to a new growth trajectory. That new trajectory lasted until about 2000 when it changed again. At about 2800 it just went vertical topping out at, let's call it 5000 or 5 times where it was when it started.

But why did I pick 1000 as the starting point. Because that is the trendline it reverted to after the crash. Zoom out to a long term chart, you'll see it. You might quibble about my trendlines, fine. I'm not trying to be precise.

After the dot com crash the trendline is up nice and steady until about 2007. We all know what happened in 2009.

We get back on the trend line in about 2013 when [redacted] gets back to about 3,500.

New trend line goes through about 2015 when the [modsbgay] sees 5000 again for the first time since 1999, about 16 years later.

Market shits itself for about a year.

New Trendline takes us to 8000 in 2018.

MArket shits itself for about a year.

New trendline in 2019, fucking vertical. Then covid.

New Trendline in 2020, vertical again.

If I do some additional retard calculations I can see that the trendline reversion for the [redacted] is about 6,500. So overvalued by about 100%. That sounds scary except that the dotcom vaulted above trendline by 500%. For us to get that high over the trendline we'd have to get to [modgazi] 30,000.

These are obviously round numbers just based on me literally putting a wooden ruler on my screen. But I think we have to double from here to get equally crazy as dotcom.

Alternately, calling [urmom] 30K.

There aren't a whole lot of tsla shorters. But there will be alot of profit taking. 

Just a week ago, we were at 380-420. Trend is still upward but  you want a more gradual raise than a rocketship.
That says a lot about you as a person and I don't trust you're judgement!
They do, but its a collectable and holds no value.
I‚Äôm up 1000% for the year. Puts on Ackman
Chipotle was in much worse shape and was turned around for a 100% profit in like 2 years. They had a food safety scandal with a way less well known brand.

The nay sayers can nay say. Its understandable that the expectation is a fintech and while I still think it goes that way, something like subway at a wild valuation is attractive. There is just no doubt about it. Especially considering PSCM expertise in the industry.

For many reasons I don't think it will end of being subway. But not because its a dying brand that can't be revitalized.

The thing is a lot of money has been printed and the market is betting on a economy recovery with a lot of money supply being printed in the upcoming years. Which means companies will have higher revenues just because there is more money.

Also with AirBNB, (not saying its not overvalued) but markets are starting to bet on brand-awereness more as revenue. Capitalism is not the same as it was no more. Nowadays the biggest brand wins by eventually taking over the entire market, look at netflix, amazon, apple, spotify, uber. Its the brand that matters, not the revenue today.

Absolutely. It‚Äôs promising for other diseases and covid as well. But the lasting response would be a shock when you look at the titers other candidates are producing.

The problem here is that AirBnB is solving a problem by creating another one.

There's already talks about regulating AirBnB in Portland Maine, and wouldn't be surprised if it's happening in other places.

That would be a question for Ryan Cohen and the board. If I had the answers I‚Äôd be running the company. All I know is with a clean balance sheet and the level of free cash flow they have they are worth far more than $13. There are companies doing far less trading at much higher valuations. Would I buy options on GME, probably not but the stock itself has upside as they right the ship.

It‚Äôll be months if not longer before we get to a point where the majority of people are vaccinated.

Agreed but interest rates (looking at 1, 5, 10, 30 year bond notes) have been slowly but steadily rising every week now since...April, May? They are still relatively quite low but once a threshold is hit a lot of big money will move to it since it will safely give an ok return

People keep saying that Airbnb causes unaffordable housing, yet Labdlords were responsible before Airbnb. Unaffordable housing in desirable neighborhoods has Always been a problem. Take a look at a prime example, Seattle. Pinpoint where [on this graph](https://i.imgur.com/OMHDk48.jpg) Airbnb was founded. The housing problem existed WELL before they did. There have even been extensive studies on Airbnb‚Äôs effect on the rental market, comparing both before and after Airbnb and cities that allow Airbnb vs ones that don‚Äôt. This study below showed that a 1% increase in Airbnb rentals in a region increased rent by 0.018%. Multiply that up a bit and say that there‚Äôs a 50% increase in Airbnb from where we are, and that‚Äôs still only a 1% increase in rent.
There‚Äôs a larger increase in rent when a new restaurant opens in a neighborhood. Why aren‚Äôt we trying to ban those?

Wondering why large institutions like JPM are long on physical silver but short the futures?  
Are they playing an arbitrage to profit of the difference between spot and futures since silver is always in backwardation? Seems odd that they would take physical delivery which is so expensive if they could in fact just roll the front month as you suggested.

Thanks for the clarification, one last question, so the bid and ask price in the screenahot are 12.95x44 and 13.30x77. Should these both be x100 and not 44 or 77 since the amount of shares per contract is 100? Thanks for making me less retarded

All we have to do is call it a tech stock and we can get that Tesla like premium on it.
It's funny, they are all also moving to Austin, which is basically Silicon Valley now. 

Also, Elon clearly just cares about money. The only reason Texas can afford to have zero state income tax is due to the massive property taxes it levies on oil companies. Philosophically, one would expect the solar energy and electric car guy to be diametrically opposed to extractive industry. 

But, hey, if you can stick it to the state that helped you grow the company from nothing just to save a few bucks on taxes, go for it.

Sorry I was never at a negative, it‚Äôs negative because I took out everything but like 5k. The number to look at is the lower one, so at my highest in Robinhood I was up 16k, I cashed out at 10k. I would upload my tda account but that‚Äôs even more confusing because it‚Äôs completely drawn out now. 
I think just the act of pulling your money out is important. I have around 5k in there rn. If I was able to double and triple my money then I can do it again, but not easily. I‚Äôm gonna rewrite my scripts and see what I did right and wrong using thinkorswim, once I can be right with high enough accuracy I‚Äôll get back in. I got emotional at the 16k high point and ignored fundamentals like valuation, momentum etc.

There are way too many success stories on wsb and stories like this are needed to remind folks of the risks.

Thanks for sharing!
WSB is a symptom of the times like Joe Kennedy‚Äôs shoeshine boy. The story goes, Joe (the president‚Äôs dad) pulled all his money out of the markets just before the Great Depression hit, and said when he started getting stock tips from his shoeshine boy, he knew it was time to exit

Take care of yourself first. Life is about the journey, not the destination. Don't be in such a rush going forward with *anything* (let's be honest, a lot of us are here because we're in a rush to have more money). Just take it as a lesson learned, and if you look at it that way, you can only move up from there. 

38 is young. I'm assuming you have your physical health. Use it. Run, or walk. Go somewhere to get your mind off of things, even if it's just a "mental vacation" in the woods, on the beach, or something for an hour or two. Don't think about anything except what is directly around you.

It's just money. It's not worth the stress that you're giving it. There's always more of it and there's a million ways to make it. If you were working in SV, you got marketable skills. Don't sweat it, just keep it moving. 

Best of luck

I remember a retarded kid tried out for the football team in high school.  Sometime during hellweek, he decided to try to squeeze out between two fence posts instead of going through the gate.  Well, his helmet was bigger than the gap between the posts and he was stuck.  Now you'd think that most people would just squeeze back between the fence posts and go through the gate or just take off the helmet so that he could fit through, but this plucky little tard just kept trying to pull his head through the fence posts with his helmet on.  I haven't seen the like of that sort of retarded determination till I found WSB.  Your zeal is an inspiration to us all.

Copied.....

I created a simple Python trading bot for IBKR that uses "The Wheel" strategy

[https://github.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang](https://github.com/brndnmtthws/thetagang)

Hey WSB,

Not sure if this is WSB appropriate because it isn't YOLO material, but I thought I'd share anyways because people in the other trading subs liked it. Maybe some of you will eventually realize it's better to have money than not have money. I also like to share the good word and collect GitHub stars which I'm sure will be worth something some day.

S'anyway, I wanted to automate one strategy for my main buy and hold account, and after a lot of messing about with various brokers/APIs I settled on IBKR for a variety of reasons. I decided to release the work I did as an open source project (you can maybe tell from my GitHub profile that I've been building software for a while, and I make things open source when I can).

I wanted to solve these problems:

* automate trading as much as possible to remove emotional mistakes/issues
* work with broad market index funds, like SPY/QQQ/VTI/TLT/BND/whatever rather than individual stocks (I prefer not to mess with stocks unless I am o.k. with losing money)
* provide more consistent returns while clipping some of the short term gains (we do this through covered calls)
* taking advantage of the historical profitability of writing puts instead of buying the underlying (check out [this paper](https://cdn.cboe.com/resources/indices/documents/pap-assetconsultinggroup-cboe-feb2012.pdf))

This strategy is based on something called "The Wheel", which is useful when you a) want to own the underlying stock or ETF and 2) want to harvest from the volatility along the way. It's a somewhat passive strategy (compared to trying to guess uppies vs downies), which is my preferred way of investing.

I won't go into a ton of detail here on why this works (or rather: IF it works), but you can check out content on YouTube or wherever to learn about 30 delta covered calls, 30 delta BuyWrite indices, theta decay, so on. From that you draw your own conclusions, and decide whether it's the right risk/reward profile.

# Example Usage

You really need to read the project README to get a better sense of how to use it, but if you REALLY want to start quick you can run it with docker (you'll still need to create `thetagang.toml`, the config for the bot, and `config.ini` for IBC, samples of which can both be found in the project):

    $ docker run --rm -it \
         -v ~/ibc:/ibc \
         brndnmtthws/thetagang:latest \
         --config /ibc/thetagang.toml

I'll be around for a little while to take questions but if you don't make me feel cute I might delete later.

Covid stocks are gonna continue to get pounded; ZM, PTON, DOCU, W, RH, LULU, CVNA, even AMZN.  i think people are gonna try to chase those highs in Aug and Oct but they‚Äôre gonna constantly fade out, traders/buyers are gonna get frustrated and give up. charts of W, PTON and ZM definitely look like a big time downtrend with Aug being the top.   

I think they also have a potential to drag down a lot of tech especially if Telsa busts.  In 2000, When bubble popped, everything went down, even good companies.  INTC and CSCO are still below what they were in 2000.

Also! If for what ever reason you want to transfer those physical shares into a digital account they‚Äôll make you turn them in. However there is a process by which you can say you ‚Äúlost‚Äù them, you‚Äôll be able to keep the physical stock.

You're wrong about this. Interest rates are so cheap right now that everyone is just going to borrow shit tons of money and invest, and as long as that is happening it'll be tough for the market to collapse.  


The market doesn't reflect how well poor people are doing, it only reflects the behavior of people who have access to capital, and I know I'm 200k in on margin on long positions because these interest rates are LOL.

Hey. Rona trader here. Made some nice profits this year and never paid taxes on capital gains yet. Should I get an accountant or is it pretty easy to do
Would not want to cuck my gains with debit spreads if you really do believe this post. Anything involving Stripe would send the price skyrocketing.

Unless you are using the reduced premium paid to buy even more spreads. In which case sure, but why not just do calls, or hell even PSTH "stock" which is actually like units, and for every 9 shares you get a warrant, which is leveraged anyways.
I‚Äôm about to put calls in. Waiting to see if they drop below $40 though. Nio day coming up and they gonna announce their sedan. Strong moves in the future. Just down cause of share sell announcement.

40 more minutes until 2 days until market opens, can't wait
As most of you know, GHIV is merging with United Wholesale Mortgage (UWM) and the merge will complete at the start of January. GHIV will share 6% of UWM, and as the market cap of UWM is 16 billion, GHIV will receive 6% of 16 billion of that. This comes to 966 million. This means that the market cap of GHIV will rise to 966 million by the end of the merge, which is over 60% higher than its current market cap of 590 million.

TL:DR GHIV market cap will raise from 590 million ‚Äî> 966 million. No more shares are being released, which means in order to support the market cap, the share price will increase by 63% (966 mil/590 mil). This means it will go from 11.22 ‚Äî> 18.2. This merge will be complete by the beginning of January, and if you have not already, I highly i advise you to do some DD and dump all in. Can‚Äôt wait to have champagne with all of you. (MADE THIS POST AND COPIED IT)

I have often thought of what I‚Äôd do if facing a long prison stretch and I‚Äôve come up with two options. 1- on the first day find the biggest baddest motherfucker in there and kill him to establish some cred. 2 - day before incarceration kill myself. I don‚Äôt think there is any middle ground.
You‚Äôll get through, I once had it like you, felt worthless and sorry for my self. If I can do a change, never doubt that you also can, Start with small steps, build a dream out in the future, maybe 5 years. 
My dream was a house, a wife, some kids and a life that give me happy thoughts and then start build up your step, 100 small step gives 1 giant leap.
Basically clever/shifty accounting. Going any deeper then that seems kinda pointless tbh; like the information isn‚Äôt super usable unless you in a similar fortunate position and even then those markets are lie or die

That's what I said though. Starting a business just to pay yourself bonuses is straight-up fraud and you'll go to prison or something. You have to actually have the seed of a legitimate business that produces something, and run it like that. You can run it like the most corrupt business possible, but that's the thing - it's the most corrupt *business* possible, not the most businessy *scam* possible.

Basically, yes. 

Good stonks are going to move around too. Say you are retarded and thought AAL had hit bottom at the end of 2019 so you bought in. Say you also had a stint of autism and bought AAPL at the bottom this past spring. AAPL is trading pretty sideways right now so you may want to sell both, wait 30 days to avoid wash sale rule, and reenter AAPL. This would let you use the loss on AAL to raise your effective cost basis for future AAPL gains.

You managed to lose money in the stock market between March 2020 and December 2020. That's pretty impressive. During the most intense rally ever, you could have literally bought any stock and just held it and made money. And yet you still just kept losing. And then, just to highlight the absurdity of it all, you suddenly make it all back during one or two otherwise mediocre trading days. Love it.

25/30 or 30/35 March debit spreads plz
If you did your TA early you would see the HnS pattern indicating the downtrend, that could Save you much money
this is the way
Genuinely curious, did you stop trading forever and have you been lurking since? FOMO would kill me to lurk but not participate

Edit: also, congratulations on hanging in there and managing life. I know a lot of us take for granted what we have

Imagine being loaded on April calls lol
Definitely 295% loss on those broker fees.
It's raised from 9 to 13 in a few short months!! 

If it's any consolation, I think it will be 20 in March.  

Take it for its worth.  I'm not that sophisticated
This guy gets it
He sure did do that, shady as f. That‚Äôs almost why it‚Äôs worth investing in his SPAC, this mf will do anything he has to

Tell that to everyone who bought calls in September or before. Everyone was shilling January as the guaranteed bet. Now I'm watching those calls bleed hoping my life-size Ryan Cohen body pillow will bring me comfort.

All I'm saying is ... goalposts have a convenient habit of moving.

Edit: ... and that I've re-upped for July 2021 calls
100% agree, though 1x sales is probably out of reach. Best buy has been killing it and they don't get 1x sales. Gme has a rough image with most investors and wall street they also need to reverse. Gonna take awhile imo, unless cohen steps in of course. Then all bets are off

95% efficacy means 95% of people will NEVER get the virus, so the remaining 5% of people who might get it will STILL have a 95% to 99% chance of living through it, meaning roughly  under 0.1% of people will die from the virus after people get the vaccine and achieve herd immunity.
Who the fuck buys a $24 GME call lmfaooo. Get baited retard
May the stock price be as high as he is.
Zoom boom
Nvda thoughts?
Ah yes the old competition is coming arguement. 

A few issues with this theory:

The major flaw with this theory is that Tesla is not going to be sitting on their ass, as competition does release better cars, you'll see Tesla improving their offerings as well. You think Tesla won't release better vehicles in the next 12 months, 24 months? You think a model 3 you buy today is going to be the exact same model 3 they will be trying to sell a year from now? Looking at their record, what gives you the impression Tesla is just going to sit silently?

Battery production is a huge problem. Right now the world just doesn't have the infrastructure to mass produce batteries at the scale needed. So even if a competitor makes a killer car let's say, how many can they ACTUALLY produce and sell? If Tesla is able to deliver on what they said at battery day, how much further ahead does this put them vs competition?

Tesla is not just a car company and you will see them diversifying their revenue streams, that really is the basis for valuation. You're going to see a lot of software based monetization but also don't sleep on the energy side of things. I firmly believe their energy business is going to be worth a lot more than their car business. 

The pie gets bigger. Its about adoption, your arguement is like saying apple stock should have stopped going up because you had increasing competition from good android devices. So yeah I don't think they maintain the same market share % of EV's but the whole market is going to expand. The world will continue to move towards EV's there's no stopping that.

I completely understand that a lot of their valuation is based on these other factors, but I don't think competition is coming is going to be the downfall, its going to be if they are unable to scale their software revenue, autonomous driving never becomes a thing, they aren't able to scale on the energy side, and aren't able to scale their insurance business.
It‚Äòs just money, fuck it. Try to get a solid job and get back on your damn feet!

I've been running an aggressive theta strategy to offset losses on long calls in NIO and GME. Certain calls are likely to lose a higher % than others with close strikes. I sell those, and if I'm not close to PDT I can do this multiple times in a day with longer expiry calls by choosing the correct order of strikes, buy them back, and finish the day selling a weekly that I can just let expire worthless or buy back the next day and sell a different weekly that has more room to fall.

This     ^

Investors now see holding treasuries as the same as holding cash, and they are facing a few questions. Do we want to extend ourselves out farther in the curve for more yield? To the point where we don‚Äôt see much liquidity? Since that likely isn‚Äôt enough, how far down are we willing to go in quality too? Single B.... maybe a CCC?

It gets to the point where your looking at a portfolio of long term debt in a dogshit company, so suddenly ur looking at Netflix with its P/E ratio about 80...... then magically 2 tech stocks ipo P/R clocking in about 30. Yeah, why the fuck not seems fair.

Exactly! This wasn‚Äôt this quarters story,  knew it would hit hard.  Not only did this quarter lose because of Covid in brick and Mortar, there is ALWAYS a slowdown the months prior to a new console cycle.

Bought more shares yesterday.

So far it is working quite well actually. However, they are still hit quote hard by covid lockdowns such as those in Europe recently. Their e-commerce is doing great but brick and mortar is still the majority of sales

More like income for companies who buy residential homes enmasse, with residential tax and regulations, then manage it using agencies and rent it out for business purposes. Or wealthy individuals who do the same with 4 to 5 units each. 

The income they make through short term rental of residential property is 300% more than typical long term rentals, so they don't mind paying additional tax for multiple properties. 

There will always be the argument of free markets and capitalism, so that's what capitalism does, the big companies and rich get richer, the working class and poor stagnate or regress.

Selling covered calls in a bear market is as close to ‚Äúfree money‚Äù as you can get.  On the flip side, you can lose a lot of potential profit if there‚Äôs a big run up on the stock. That‚Äôs why they are less than ideal in a bull market.  If you‚Äôre comfortable owning and holding a particular stock, consider selling cash secured puts when you‚Äôre bullish. Another great way to collect premiums. Worst case you wind up owning the stock at a discount   (a discount vs the price when you sold the put - you still may end up paying more than the market value if the stock drops considerably)

most of the profits on oil doesn't come from gasoline...oil companies only make a few cents on the gallon. its mostly from jet fuel/diesel/petrochemicals. Engines are not going away anytime soon. Look around the room you're in: how much plastic do you see? its everywhere and its derived from petrochemicals. Plastic is cheap, durable, and so practical and its just not going away. It sucks for the environment but nobody really cares we keep buying the stuff. You're typical EV has over 700 pounds of plastic.

You have a lot of sway on the market when you're a billionaire and all the clueless CNBC fucks actually believe the shit you say.
Honestly imo something people underestimate thinking about markets is the amount of money controlled by middle class boomers *who don‚Äôt really understand stocks*. 

I know people with several hundred K accounts who don‚Äôt understand the difference between growth and value. Who don‚Äôt understand why investing in a non profitable company is risky.
Okay OP is trying to shift the blame, its actually him
Around IPO this sub was very anti-PLTR. I bought in at $9.50/share regardless and was on the fence about dumping it because of all the WSB FUD merchants. Now everyone thinks Thiel is the next Elon Jesus.

I have been watching PLTR very closely since I bought in at 15. I think people are sleeping on how many shares Asia and Europe have bought up. 

Shows very similar patterns to NIO during it's surge. 1 or 2 green days, then a small dump. The next week, every day starts with a PM pump but ends the day red.

Fridays it shows temporary life but still ends red. And then Monday morning it blows up. Yesterday morning I thought we would hit 35 again this Monday but fall back and maintain 30 by the end of this week.

But now, with CNBC talking about PLTR distributing the vaccine, I think the boomers will rotate in Monday, we may see 40 but we won't fall below 35 at that point.
Lol I've been trying to talk myself out of learning how to redo the eaves on my house.  Since getting laid off, I've completely redone three of the rooms, with a living room and a bathroom to go. Didn't even know how to change a light switch before Feb.

I am definitely biased since I own it but it‚Äôs a growth stock and P/E is incredibly low compared to other stocks. Just look at SNOW, they have less revenue and are valued double or more than PLTR.. its about hype and potential, end of 2021 will be 50-75$ imho
So... Calls on nigiri?
I mean Tesla has been in this boat forever only a few billion in revenue barely profitable with a market cap of almost 600B

I've always enjoyed Star Wars lore, but never loved the movies. The Jedi series of video games and even moreso, KOTOR 1 and 2 really showed the potential of the Star Wars Universe.

And the Mandalorian scratches all the right itches for me. Initially I was taken aback from how episodic it felt, but by the 3rd episode it found it's footing and truly harkens back to 90s era Hercules and Xena Warrior Princess tv shows. 

Truly great story telling in fantastical settings that benefit from the genre.

Nice when do you think it will rocket?
The whole point of going public is so the company could gather funds from investors to raise capital and pay off debt and gradually grow from the support of the investors. Northman is a pessimist , he always highlights the negatives.
While you can easily argue its a good problem to have, it's a problem. 

Tesla is hyping up EVs to a level greater than they can support. This means inevitably they're hyping up the competition. If they were priced like a very promising up and commer, this would be great. Good growth, potential acquisition target, segment leader with fantastic potential. 

They're being priced as the largest car company in the history of the world. Remember that if you're paying for potential it's assumed you're paying a discount so if Tesla the same as companies that have a combined market share of 40% the bet would be that they ultimately have 50 to 60% of the market. 

This does not happen if next year there's demand for 5 or 10 million EVs and they can't even deliver 1 million. If ANY of the big carmakers has a breakout hit, even if Tesla has more demand, it doesn't do them much good to be the first choice if the second choice is actually a product you can buy today instead of a year from today.

They're doing marketing for the competition until they can meet demand and if they lose the crown even for a little bit, the magic is gone. They're just a fox valued like a tiger.

Mind you, I put my money in Tesla because while I in no way believe in the company (in its ability to actually ever grow in to its current evaluation) I do believe in the hype. But I'm in the privileged position of being able to be wrong, lose everything I own in Tesla and be nothing more than upset that I followed my gut instead of my brain. 

I believe people believe that the stock is worth more and so far, I've been correct. I can afford to push my luck. If you can too, all aboard. But I cannot stress this enough, Tesla is currently more Vegas strip than Wallstreet. Everyone invested in Tesla is trying to figure out if everyone else is bluffing or if a majority genuinely wants to go all in pre flop.

TLDR
For the love of Christ do not go into debt to buy Tesla. Buy if you can afford to lose what you invest.
One sec, let me flip these burgers
Fun fact: Taiwan has only had 7 deaths total this whole pandemic. Vietnam had 35 total. Proportionally for the US population, that would be about 100 deaths. Instead we‚Äôve got 300,000

It‚Äôs because they actually did what needed to be done in March rather than dragging their feet and whining like little bitches and now they get to live in country with essentially no virus.
That‚Äôs a very uneducated assumption you fucking weirdo

If a company is down, and investors don‚Äôt expect it to ever recover significantly, they might sell shares at a loss to offset their gains from stocks they sold at a profit and minimize their tax liability. Meaning that, if this theory is correct, stonks that are in the gutter will slide down the storm drain, basically.

Your losses offset your gains for tax purposes. So if AAA netted you $10K in realized short term gains and stock BBB has you at $5K in unrealized losses you can sell stock BBB, realize those losses, and only pay taxes on $5K in gains on AAA.
Home improvement projects are more expensive, addicting, and have lower returns than FDs.

You could be right. What I know is my experience hiring on their platform: 

I've hired 6 people now and every time it's been such a good experience that it makes me wonder what kind of lunatic would ever hire salaried, full-time staff. I believe we are approaching a tipping point within firms where the default plan is to use freelancers. Only the most special/high-leverage roles will involve postwar/boomer style full-time/salaried employment.

It will go down because the 6pm news reported on the story about people with severe allergies getting killed, sent into shock, face paralyzed by the vaccine.

I'm not making a claim on how true it is because I'm not an anti-vaxxing retard but every station ran the same story last night. It's gonna cause fear and uncertainty. People in America will simply refuse Pfizer's vaccine on news like this.

**[Keynesian beauty contest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Keynesian beauty contest)**

A Keynesian beauty contest is a concept developed by John Maynard Keynes and introduced in Chapter 12 of his work, The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money (1936), to explain price fluctuations in equity markets. It describes a beauty contest where judges are rewarded for selecting the most popular faces among all judges, rather than those they may personally find the most attractive.

Almost everywhere in the US, your butthole is safe in prison - prisoners don't just rape people for the fuck of it. And if someone did try to intimidate you into giving up your commissary or something, your people will automatically get your back as long as you stick up for yourself first. 

The worst thing you may face is having to put in work for your people (stab this dude or we stab you later). You'll have to choose between risking more prison time or living with child molesters and rapists and snitches in protective custody. Obviously, you're comfortable with a high degree of risk, so this shouldn't bother you too much.

Pfister and BNTX dropped after the final approval pump Thursday evening.

It will probably pump back up Monday morning momentarily and then drop back down to $120-$125 range later on as it tapers off.

Ok retards. The FDA approval is not a sensational news. FDAs requirement for vaccine is a 60% effectiveness. When Pfizer, Biontech or moderna introduced their vaccines with a effectiveness of above 90% the approval was mostly priced in with the news.

I was thinking 100$ every now and then on some possibly growing penny stocks, depending on where the future will seem to be headed on (some time ago it would have been EV's, for example). I mean, at worse those100$ will turn to what? 20? 10? Who cares!

You get to claim 3k for losses per year. That‚Äôs like saying: instead of just pulling out $2 now and having $2 now that you wouldn‚Äôt be taxed on anyways and claiming it 14 years later.

So what if the vaccine stuff is buy rumor sell the news.  By that I mean the announcement and roll out is the rumor but the high level vaccination is the news. 

I was in PR Hurricane Maria and its aftermath.  The storm lasted like 16-18 hours of tropical force/Hurricane force winds.  It hit us at like 2 or 3 in the morning and it wasn't safe to go outside until like 7 or 8  in the night.  Super stoked it was over (rumor).  Went walking around the next day and it is was like a warzone and you could instantly tell it was going to be a long road back (the news).  

Likewise,  there is great optimism right now but when we get out  from shelter and start shifting through the rubble,  its going to be very bearish.
What the fuck is an intrinsic
I think investors are expecting that the stock market is going to soar after we all get a vaccine and the economy gets back to normal. The problem is that ALL the investors think that so as a result the stock market is soaring now as people shovel money in expecting it will go up once we get out of COVID. I think the reality is that there will be no jump because everyone who would get in are already in and when folks realize that the market isn't going to suddenly go up they'll get out like a tidal wave.

So yeah had I timed in perfectly, I wouldn‚Äôt have needed the cash sitting there for months. But even without timing in, it‚Äôs still exploded more than anything else I‚Äôd held. It‚Äôs a good way to get in on the ground floor basically, in my view.

Might be 15 years. That's how long it took for MSFT to reach the same levels from the bubble. 

It all depends on how stretched the valuation is. TSLA is an amazing company and it's clear as day they'll dominate the EV market in the foreseeable future. But the earnings of 2780 are priced in right now so buying now to hold for the future might be a 10+ years play.
Probably roll forward until price drops and you can get out.  But I wonder if it's worth it at that point since you missed selling at the top.  I stopped selling calls for now but may sell ATM if it gets to 100+ and just let them get called away.  Can always sell puts to get back in.

Even without a short squeeze, if they can just maintain revenues of $6B+ and continue to pay down debt, which now they have less than $400m worth of debt, the company should be worth $78/share at the current share count. That‚Äôs to trade at 1x revenues. Giving them a $6B market cap. If they can find a way to get that back growing again there‚Äôs no telling where it can go.

Reminder for all the Robinhood traders.

The reason stocks are doing good right now is that there is literally nothing else worth investing in at the moment. Nothing at all.

Stocks are in a stupid big bubble and are going to come crashing down when less... Insane... Minds get to work on rectifying our shit.

Diversify into index funds. Don't go trying to ride these massively overinflated stocks. You'll lose everything. Tesla is not worth even a 10th of what it is selling for right now. If Musk died tomorrow or suffered a stroke, that entire company is going bankrupt in a month.

So please, don't invest anything you aren't able to safely lose entirely.

Bro germans are the superior car makers and tesla wont ever come remotely close to that. They may have a small advantage atm in the EV field, but the germans (and cheap car makers)are knocking at the door with cheaper EV‚Äôs better designed cars and all that. Their market share is going to be determined if people are willing to buy a tesla, even though other cars will be electrically as good. I dont see a competitive advantage there, because their advantage atm is their electric ability. But this ability gap is getting lower lower between the other car producers which leads to the market share going to the cheapest and best designed cars, which aint tesla.

Edit: i can‚Äôt take you serious if you really think that tesla‚Äôs are better designed and look cooler than: porsche/bmw/mercedes/volkswagen/audi

That's me right now. Threw almost everything I had at the market April-October but I haven't added a dollar since then and I don't expect to until February at the earliest. I'm building up cash and waiting, currently 20% cash but once I hit 40% or so I'll hold steady at that. Even if it's a few years before a crash, I'm still better off investing after a 30%+ drawdown.
It's only a bubble if cash is ever more appealing than equity. And at the rate the governments of the world are willing cash into existence, cash is basically TP

People really said that every year since tho. When did you get in the market? When I bought AMZN, SHOP, SQ, TSLA, NVDA, AAPL, in 2017 to 2018, people literally said the same thing on every single one of these. Now that I'm up 200% to 1000% on these, you are telling that a 50% market crash is going to wipe me out? Iunno man. 

It's one thing to say TSLA *might* drop to $200. It's another to say TSLA is gon drop to $50, which is the price I got it at and just 2 years ago, when everyone and their mom said its waaaay too overvalued. How are you so sure this won't happen for another 2 years on some other meme stocks, and how can you know how big the crash of the bubble is? 

I see very few worlds where people are sitting out since 2018 can somehow get back at me when shit goes down. And if you are going to say "well 2018 wasn't that bad, I'm talking about 2020 only", then all I'm saying is I've literally heard the exact same thing in 2018 compared to 2016, and 2016 compared to 2014. Every year has been the peak of the bubble since early 2010s. I never know where y'all people have so much confidence in your takes.

At $5 a share GameStop has a market cap of $326m. In Q3 they had $604m in cash alone. You honestly think they will drop that low? The cash alone makes them worth $10. Which they used used $125m of it to pay down debt early on Friday making the bankrupt argument even weaker. 

(Before the early debt payoff) They had about 263m in short term debt and 216m in long term debt. Meaning they could any any point just be debt free and run off cash. You can‚Äôt be bankrupt without debt. Ontop of that they said multiple times on their call they will be Profitable in Q4. This will be the best quarter they ever had in years, nothing about this company screams $5 to me. It‚Äôs severely undervalued mostly from all of the pressure from short sellers and a management team that‚Äôs bad at hyping up what a significant turn around it‚Äôs actually had.

Edit* for future readers. I was corrected on another comment. They actually had $725m in cash, the $600 Is what was left after they allocated the money for the debt payoff.

Well said. I work in software development and some of these tech stock price evaluations make me laugh as the underlying tech is mostly just a bunch of frameworks bandaged together.

The business concepts can be somewhat brilliant, but the underlying tech is usually ridiciuously simple by modern standards and the techincal solutions are not worth much.

Linux is a real masterpiece of a software, but it is worth precisely zero dollars. Most open source projects in general have much more valuable software than these overpriced IPOs.

Is it time to short the market?
What‚Äôs crazy to me about this chart is we have HALF the amount of shares as they did in 2013, higher demand for the xboxes/ps5s then the last console cycle, GameStop has $600m in cash (now about $475 from paying down a ton of debt on Friday), and short interest is hovering at an all time high. That console spike should be so much higher than anything they have ever seen. GameStop has a market cap of $900m currently. They will bring in multiples of that in Q4 alone. Long GME and likely will add to my position (2,614 shares @ $5.58 currently)

Edit* don‚Äôt forget every Xbox they sell they get LIFETIME revenue from digital sales on the Xbox as well.

Because it makes you realise the importance (to banks) of compound interest?
Please consider borrowing money, buying Upwork shares, and immediately selling them on the open market - I may be a buyer.

Consider these 0 innovation boomercompanies competing with Upwork:

* Robert Half (RHI) - $7.2B market cap

* Infosys (INFY) - $67B market cap

A conservative projection for this company is they surpass Infosys which is **14x from today**.

Revenue accrues to innovators sort of like a law of physics. It's like gravity. Upwork is an innovator and has one innovative competitor, Fiverr. I believe they have been out-innovating Fiverr in the last 6 months.

To add another consideration to the "Bull" argument: Global freelance labor may have a winner-take-all (for ex: AWS in IaaS) or duopoly (for ex: UBER and LYFT in transportation) network effect. The more Upwork is adopted, the more economic pressure is placed on their systems, the more they innovate, driving more adoption, etc. etc.
I guess he didn't charge you any fee for the advice. You're lucky!
You think it will fall that low? They ended Q3 with over $600m in cash. $12 would be about $800m market cap. We are getting close to GameStop trading back at cash levels. That would be a no brainer buy. They did however use $125m on Friday to pay down debt early. But still makes the company more valuable. Not sure why it‚Äôs still trading as if it‚Äôs bankrupt.
This is way better than my joke. Great retort!

They got rocked 2 months ago on the news of a vaccine and are way down since. It's possible they keep going down, but I wouldn't play that because the response to just the vaccine's possibility was already too optimistic. The reality of vaccinating the population seems like it can't possibly live up to the expectations.
For real though:  
- continuous immigration  
- disappearance of the middle class  
- food prices leading to war

I agree... Shopify has a smaller Global TAM and tons of cutthroat competitors.

Upwork has a handful of competitors and in recent months they've reclaimed the mantle of software innovation - the examples top of mind are their cloning of Fiverr's structured marketplace, and their partnerships with Zoom and Citrix.

I recently onboarded to Upwork for yet another company. This flow had multiple critical improvements compared to the experience I had 6 and 18 months prior. 

Their web application is really getting better. I can see the innovation. Hayden Brown (their new CEO, spent a decade at Microsoft) is clearly focused on software excellence and this will be the global SaaS labor company.

His/her sextape
I lost $660,000 (starting with 10,000). Over 99% over a period of two months this year. Clawing it back now from $10,000 to over six figures - trading mentality is sound and I now possess galvanized balls. No high blood pressure or loss of hairline. 

To put it quite frankly and empathetically, stop being a little bitch about it. It‚Äôs all about how you respond. You are the only one in the world that controls how you react to crisis, pain, emotional stress, loss, regret and everything else you interact with him life that you consider an event. No one else even knows it‚Äôs happening in real-time. Remember that you‚Äôre in charge of your own reality. Very sorry to hear you‚Äôre suffering deep regret and remorse over this. I‚Äôd take a step back, focus on your personal growth and your career. After clearing your head and at least a six month break, I‚Äôd bet you try again. So stop feeling so sorry for yourself *now* and the sooner you‚Äôll begin recovery. 

Last but not least. The real pain and regret will not go away until you stop hiding it from your family if that‚Äôs what‚Äôs most important to you and top of mind. I know this as fact because you mentioned not sharing this with your mother because she‚Äôd freak out. Accepting loss, or suffering consequences is a huge reason why people can‚Äôt seem to close out losing trades and ride them to zero. It comes from childhood, your family, and the emotional pain incurred that is so deeply engrained in many of us. We don‚Äôt want to disappoint or do harm, admit it and deal with it. My guess is you never liked disappointing your parents growing up. Accept responsibility for your fucking losses and regroup. Seek your mother‚Äôs guidance and wisdom. You will heal quicker and feel better. 

Or... talk to her boyfriend about it.

Imagine losing $660,000 and telling your GF your ‚Äúoops. 660,000 is all gone. Done.‚Äù Oh that was fun... but it‚Äôs all about growth, forgiving yourself, clearing the air and those around you with unconditional love will stand by you always. It will help you rebuild your confidence in yourself. Don‚Äôt fault yourself for taking risks in life to do something profound and life changing, just manage it better on the next go and with better mental framework and mechanical, objective trading. 

Take care of yourself bud, mentally and physically. It‚Äôs not called a problem if money can fix it. We all bounce back if mentally capable. 

There‚Äôs my therapy session. To everyone else: Fuck you all and see you Monday at the circus.

> there is zero reason we need to be in this strong of a market/bubble when GDP has contracted sharply and unemployment at 10-year highs.

It's high because the whole economy gets consolidated into gigantic transnational companies. The poors who lost their waiter job and the closure of mom and pop shops is irrelevant.
Fight for isn't exactly right. They've chosen it as an avenue to differentiate and also bake it into the price.

No one has to buy puts for the price to fall. Why anyone would choose TSLA over BRK.B at the same price is baffling. You must truly hate companies who make money as oppose to ones promising people a one way trip to Mars.

Here's the thing retard, if the green return figure isn't single-day it's likely the cumulative return of his **current holdings.** If you look at the graph that would explain the small dip on the 8th or 9th where **he sold off his last set of options** and **bought a new set with a later expiry.** $EDIT stock surged some 55% from the 8th to the 10th. His green figures show the cumulative return of his 1, maybe 2-day old options, which shot from around $100k to $322k. His account had been at 12k the prior week, just as the graph shows. This is in-line with what I've been saying from the start.

Edit: I just checked the OP's posts and he states he had 12k on Dec 3rd (as I pointed out on the graph early on) and that 218k is indeed his single-day return. Either the green figure shows cumulative holding return and he has 1-day old options, or the return figure is set to show single-day return; possibly because it's customizable by user). Either way you're wrong and I'm right.

Fuckhead.

Be careful assuming everyone‚Äôs experience is the same as your own. Right now I can‚Äôt charge at home. I just moved into a new place and don‚Äôt have a charger installed yet, so I‚Äôm currently living like the millions of people who can‚Äôt charge at home due to living in a city / apartment / condo. My car has ‚Äú300‚Äù miles of range. Except that 300 miles is really 265, because it‚Äôs not healthy or convenient to charge the battery to 100% every day (while charging publicly, the final 20% of battery takes twice as long to charge because charge speed dramatically slows as the battery gets closer to full). Except that 265 is really 210 right now because there‚Äôs a ~20% efficiency loss in cold weather. And I lose ~ 20-30 miles of range every night to vampire drain while the car just sits there, because it‚Äôs always on and running Sentry mode cameras, managing battery temperature and being ‚Äúawakened‚Äù anytime I open the app or prompt a widget on my phone. So now after just a few dormant days the car is down to ~100 miles. Under 60 miles the car goes into a power saving mode, shutting off convenience settings like Sentry and cabin preheat settings. That means I need to find a charger publicly on my very next errand run when I haven‚Äôt even driven the car. If that‚Äôs happening every few days I need public chargers to be available, abundant, convenient, and fast.

So yes, EV ownership makes a lot of sense for suburban home ownership. But that‚Äôs only so many people. Public infrastructure remains a critical piece of the puzzle, even for longer range cars.

Question: while I agree market caps compared to fundamentals have become completely detached, one needs to look at current conditions compared to previous crashes. Yes, unemployment is high, GDP low etc. this is due to the demand shock of COVID. How will things pick up once the vaccine is distributed? 
Monetary policy is also different now. During the previous crashes, there was no QE. With very low interest, where else do you want to invest (TINA). This causes asset price inflation (the newest mandate of central banks). What I just wonder is with so many companies being number to these conditions, how can we ever get out of this? If interest (cost of money) were to rise, there would be a massive purge of zombie companies, which in itself is good, but I‚Äôm not sure MP allows this anymore. This is ignoring fiscal policy for now. 
What do you guys think, i.a. current monetary policy conditions compared to previous crashes? EDIT: I don‚Äôt know how to make spaces between paragraphs on my phone

Add in SNOW for fun too. 

Also, revenues don't even equal profits, so investors are paying like $300B for 3 companies that basically just lose money.  The focus on revenues is stupid. It doesn't mean shit if expenses go up as well.  

Imagine an entrepreneur who goes on stage on Shark Tank and makes a pitch where they have to reveal their margins are shit and the only thing they do is lose money. They'd get laughed off stage. Yet that's what these companies these days during the .com bubble 2.0. are. Money losing companies that are valued at billions.  

There are other value plays out there in companies that actually grow revenue, are growing their *positive earnings*, and who have low valuation ratios. I refuse to pay extraordinary premiums on companies that lose money just because they're in tech.  For every amazon there were 100x more failures.  This is absolutely without question a huge bubble.


And with respect to regulatory push back, it is happening. My bro lives in Jersey City, which is a prime target for Airbnb due to access to NYC. Airbnb pursued a very bitter campaign against anti-short term rental efforts and hired all sorts of consultants to try to undermine the debate. Airbnb astroturfed the debate and created a shell organization to look like it was made via a legit grassroots efforts (basically the fake organization argued that grandpa needed help with mortgage so we need short term rentals).  Rent and home prices are already fucked in Jersey City, so it was good they rejected airbnb.  But make no mistake, airbnb basically pulls the big tobacco playbook out on locals to try to undermine regulatory pushback.
OP -$54k or total -$144k is not a big deal. It feels like it but it isn't. It's imaginary. We all are just playing monopoly with our lives but it doesn't matter in any way. Just take care of your mental health.. Your losses prove that you're truly an autist. You're safe with us bro.
Not if you keep putting in money. You lose money in Nasdaq ETF only when you stop investing after the crash, long term investors don‚Äôt do that. If you keep investing, you‚Äôll buy stocks dirt cheap after crash and they‚Äôll grow to make you good return. On average, profit + loss gives you descent return over a period of 30 something year.

2001 bubble was really severe because there was too much confusion and misconceptions about tech market and it‚Äôs unlikely we will ever see that kind of crash.

You can do it living in Manhattan, probably save a lot more than that, or in the middle of nowhere where your housing will be like $200 a month.

Top is in.
Our credit system is way more robust than it used to be. Im not sure what the limit is now but Im positive that the valuations in the early 80s were similarly out of whack with the previous reality. With hindsight that fear mongering seemed silly until 2002. The banking system had changed and new levels of debt ratios became possible. 1987 showed us the new limits of debt ratios. We didn‚Äôt heed until 2002 after it was too late. Same limits applied in 08. We‚Äôve blown past those limits for 5 years now. Its time to realize the banking system solved the previous limits of debt ratios again.
Even if money is free to borrow how does that translate to stocks at all time high p/e valuations under horrible economic conditions?

If you're a hedge fund manager, and you know the market is about to be cornered, you would already have positioned yourself to take advantage of it. They would have already driven the price up in a scramble to get exposure. There is no way it's easy profits, and hedge funds decided they won't participate in those easy profits.

me and tsla in A nutshell
One time I accidentally got dosed with a 4x blotter of 25I-NBOMe. Swear I literally left my body and watch myself die. 

I also vividly remember thinking I could turn the light switch on and off without turning the light on. I did that for a solid 2 hours at my parents house at 4 am in their hall way.

My dad was super cool about it. I told him I was tripping way to fucking hard and he just let me wig the fuck out and waited till I crashed and made sure I was good. Next day took me out to breakfast. I literally didn‚Äôt eat anything and all I could taste was iron for about a week. Really fucked my up. 

On the other hand I‚Äôve had some super clean acid and enjoyed myself.

Oversimplification imo. There were multiple factors that caused the crash over many months. It‚Äôs not as if higher rates being bearish was a new idea in the year 2000 or that the market just went straight down the day they hiked rates. There were also a string of bankruptcies in recently ipo‚Äôd companies and bad news compounded over many months. If it were as easy as ‚Äúduh, Fed raised rates‚Äù Then why did most people get wiped out despite having several months to sell before the market finally bottomed? Assuming everyone from bygone eras were just stupid is a mistake.

Yeah but what does it mean? Stocks are bought/sold when the market is open, if they want to add all the stocks before opening on the 21st, it means they have to buy them before close on the 18th.

So will they put in a large 100 million order sometime on the 18th? What if the bidding price is too low and they can't fill their 100 million order? Will they increase the bidding price? Or will they be allowed to cheat the system and buy from who knows where that has 100 million stocks they want to sell for x money between friday close and monday open?

Those are the questions i want answers to :/

I keep reading this same line of thinking where we‚Äôre in a bubble just like the late 90‚Äôs but it‚Äôs early because that one lasted five years so there‚Äôs plenty more upside. This is just what the bulls like to tell themselves to delude themselves into believing they aren‚Äôt part of the hysteria. But I think the entire argument is nonsense.

First, we‚Äôre not in a bubble at all, which is a term thrown around way too often. A bubble occurs in a single asset class that is new and poorly understood, but the masses believe there is unlimited potential (internet stocks, weed stocks, internet coin, etc.). That‚Äôs not what‚Äôs happening broadly right now in the stock market. The stock market is just super frothy and basically a craps table where most everyone knows it‚Äôs retarded but are happy to keep buying because everything keeps going up.

Second, why do people expect the market to follow the same schedule as a completely different era and why do people assume this is year one? Again, delusion among the ‚Äúsmart‚Äù bulls who will just sell when the Fed starts tightening, because, after all that‚Äôs the only thing that matters, right?

Which brings me to my last point: if everyone is fixated on the Fed and believes the time to sell will be when the Fed starts tightening again (which, by their own constant weekly reminders, won‚Äôt happen for at least several months), what are the odds nobody else will realize this amazing idea and plenty of people will be happy to buy your shares near the top? Speculators who make big money in bull markets very rarely keep it. Why do you think that is? Because very few are smart enough to know when it‚Äôs time to sell until it‚Äôs too late.
door dash had 53% gross margins last quarter

That means after paying delivery drivers.

Becoming profitable with scale is simple, increase your top line by 30%-100% per year, and increase your operating costs at 20% per year.  Eventually you are profitable

I don't think there's any changes they need to make, and they have a fairly long runway to get to bottom line profitability considering they can now finance their negative operating income with a share issue.

Word. From your lips...I would prefer if wsb really jumped on the BB wagon from 16 to 30 but the writing is on the wall right here. Seems like there is building interest here and apparently on discord. Earnings are earnings tho so we need something forward looking, positive and tangible. They have been planning this move for six years and it‚Äôs taking a long time to get all the pieces in position but they are finally just about there. Could be a quarter or two early but I‚Äôm willing to take that risk. Hope they have a good plan for firing folks up before during and after earnings. All of Chen‚Äôs big payouts are tied to stock price in the next three years so his eyes are on the prize.

> Hope he didn‚Äôt buy **naked** calls in $ROPE

Some noob asked him how it was possible to make so much in a week to which he replied "naked calls". Dude really has nearly 0 idea what he's doing and just bought shit cause it was related to his major and got incomprehensibly lucky.

For any other noobs that see this: you cannot buy a naked call; it would just be a long call. A call (or put) is only naked when *sold* with no collateral support (i.e. no shares for a call, no cash to secure a put). Without the coverage you're naked and vulnerable to whatever the market wants to shove in you. The maximum upside from a naked option is the credit - it won't swing to the moon like his post.

Late to the party but just wanted to send words of encouragement. Like what everyone else is telling you, don't give up dude. I'm sure where you're standing at right now blows but the good thing is that you can still move forward. You know what you F'd up on and use that knowledge to not make the same mistakes again or help someone else not to do the same. You also still have your mom and friends who still cares. Also, look at everyone in this community and their comments. I know we are a bunch of strangers online and are after the same goal, but I think we all want what's best for the next person. So set a new small goal (like getting into shape or new job) and go after it. After you hit that mark, setup another goal (maybe something bigger) and go after that. 5-10yrs from now, you'll look back and will still call yourself a dumbass still but at least you're better off now than the day you hit rock bottom. Goodluck and I hope to see a happy post from you soon.

Not really citron, but the discussion around Chinese stock delisting and also as general Sell-off in EV.
No, the strike price is $160. The breakeven price is $161.32, OPs theoretical breakeven (not gain or lose money) to exercise the options. That is, $160 + $1.32 (the premium OP paid). They would need the stock to be $161.32 to breakeven if they exercise by buying 100 shares for $160. In this case, shares are like $173, which is why the premium in the screenshot is like $13.13, because the contact for 100 shares at $160 is now worth that amount ($13.13) which is close to the intrinsic value of the contact. If the option wasn't expiring today then the premium would likely be higher as time adds value to the option as well.

If it expires in the money the clearinghouse will autoexercise it and if you don't have the cash in your account to purchase shares, the broker must loan it to you. You'd immediately be margin called and RH's money is at risk until you settle it

**LOL I CAUGHT YOUR ASS RED HANDED AND YOU STILL WON'T ADMIT YOU'RE WRONG!** You spent an entire day defending a larping stranger on the internet and you can't even admit you're in the wrong. You did all that to defend a brokerage you didn't even use, and you changed your argument several times.

**Again, it's Webull. It shows fucking all-time account gains next to the account value.** You probably read that and now you're like, oh shit, I'm wrong, now I can't win the argument, so I'm just gonna call him hopeless. HAAHHAHAHAAHA. You REALLY can't even admit you're wrong. You literally defended a lying OP THE ENTIRE DAY without even knowing how the brokerage worked. 

**OP had six figures and was lying for karma. And you got into an argument with a stranger because you wanted to live vicariously through one of the many lying larpers here on wallstreetbets.** Well, I got news. It's fucking retards like you who are making the fake upvoted shit go to the top. Because you're absolutely retarded.

**Think long and hard about what you've done today and how you spent the entire day for an argument you lost in the end.** Webull shows all-time account gains next to the account value. Not single-day gains. So OP lied, he started with six figures. And the chart you defended is all bullshit. And you just defended him because you're some retard who can never admit he's wrong, only double, triple, quadruple, quintiple down on every incorrect argument. And now, you're just calling me hopeless in ad hominem because you realized you were wrong and have no more cards up your sleeve.

**Go back to your 9th grade language arts classes, you fucking retard.** HAHAHHAHAAH I WIN BITCH NOW FUCK YOU, STOP UPVOTING LYING LARPERS LIKE THIS ON WALLSTREETBETS

It's okay, the IRS allows for T&A.
Back in the day more specialized stuff was less common so it could charge a higher premium, and that lead to higher production values. Talent that normally wouldn't do freaky stuff could say "step-brother" and make more, so the genre started becoming more popular by producing objectively higher quality content than generic stuff. Now the specialization of the genre is a relic of a different economy but the interest remains due to its universal omnipresence

That's... That's whats happening man. People noticed that over the course of a week if a stock got mentioned on TV it would go up, so they buy as soon as they hear it, then online trading comes and that's cut down to it going up in an hour and they can do it real time and trades take the amount of time it takes to pull out your phone. Now the only way to beat that is algo trading which is what we are looking at. 

Stocks value has so little to do with the real numbers and so much to do with the way people feel about those numbers, the way people are told to feel about those numbers by trusted sources, and the way some computer programmers tell their programs to interpret these numbers. And every one of these sources is biased.

How retarded do you have to be to talk about P/E for a company that just broke profitability. A P/E of 1.23e45 is still better than a P/E of -10, in fact a P/E of -1.23e45 is miles better than than a P/E of -10. 

Just say that TSLA's P/S is 21.68, that's enough.

Nvidia has the second highest P/S in the entire SP500 and they're at 22.01, and you know Nvidia has 62% gross margin and 27% operational margin. Meanwhile Tesla sits at 9.2% operational margin. 

Average P/S in the SP500 is 2.6, yeah no shit Tesla is overvalued at 21.68

Sexy redditors of sex reddit, what's the sexiest sex you've ever sexed?
I started trading in 2018. I blew about 5k pretty quickly. I took a break for a few months.
Ended up turning $50 into $500 in a month trading options early 2019. Ended up blowing it after adding a $1000 to it and making it into $3k in 2 days later after the deposit. But once I blew it shortly after I took another break for almost the entire year of 2019. 

I thought to my self I would be done with trading because I recognized my business as a investment strategy and that i didn‚Äôt need stocks as long as my business was up. 

But then I went through divorce and came back to the market because the motivations are different these days with my business.

When you have someone criticizing you for being gone all the time to make money from a family business and use that against you as why your not fit for having kids in joint custody. I‚Äôm like fuck that. 

Now I have my kids 50/50 and when I‚Äôm home with my kids those weeks its all I think about is the market and how I know I‚Äôm going to get it right. 

Prove people wrong that told me I should just stick to ac repair. This market is my way out. I enjoy what I do but I‚Äôve done it my entire adult life. Which is still 12 years but that‚Äôs a long time and I can‚Äôt see my self 50-70 trying to fix ac. 

My strategic goal is make it trading options/forex using my business profits. 

I have a trade group on Facebook traderoom1134 you can go if you want to follow my trading. I took a break for last 2 months cause I got a little out of hand. 

I won‚Äôt be doing so much gambling on weeklies this next year. I don‚Äôt care what wsb says lol

In Munich where I live the city is building up a network of charging stations with universal connectors.  
Going forward I think this and private "gas station" like businesses will dominate the electric charging market.  

A fun fact about this, I recently talked to a friend who works in the power grid department of the city, he said that most european cities would crash their power grid if electric vehicles and charging stations were to become mainstream too quickly. The power grids in most cities are quite outdated and don't have the capacity to add thousands of EVs with 150kw stations.

I stayed in that house for 14 months rent was 4500. A few years later I try and understand how I even afforded it. Hindsight is if I stayed in the duplex we lived in 2 bedroom for 1450 for 2-3 years when we first moved here I could have bankrolled my business. But there is no get backs and I just chalk it up that I had never made any real money before so when I started to do I guess I acted accordingly. Plus I had 4 kids and my wife would always push me to ‚Äúdo better.‚Äù

Funny thing is I pay $2300 for a 2 bedroom apartment and my x pays $2400 for her 2 bedroom.
I was struggling to pay $4500 but now I‚Äôm paying out $5000 monthly lol between rent and child support

Not if it's ITM and short

If it's ITM and long they could not exercise it, but OPRA regs require all options be automatically exercised on behalf of the client unless the client explicitly instructs otherwise. It makes no sense to do this economically though, you'd potentially lose a ton of money

The difference is we are fucking printing money since 2008-2012 then again in 2016, 2018 and 2020 

When you just print money and inject it into the market the price of anything you can buy goes up. The reason we don‚Äôt have ‚Äúinflation‚Äù is the ECB is printing just like us and China is manipulating their currency 

You are just throwing money into the economy to fight off deflation. It will stabilize prices in some areas and raise prices in others

because the total value at risk of holding an option is a lot less than the total value at risk of holding the shares representing said option. it gets even more complicated considering options exercise after close and you thus take overnight or even over-weekend risks.

RH knows this and they are managing their risk accordingly. plenty of brokers have gone bankrupt (MF Global to name one) due to retarded and stupid clients who have no idea about risk management

Tesla has some huge shortcomings which actually directly impact their cars. 

QC is a huge one. The stuff that Tesla delivers to costumers would never ever pass QC at some other manufacturer. That is my personal reason why I won't buy a Tesla in the near future. The build quality and materials just aren't okay for that price. 

Their design choices are questionable with the Model 3 for example having that huge ass screen and nothing else. 

And a big one is parts availability. I can walk into any BMW dealer here, most parts will be in stock and if not delivery takes at most 24 hours. Good luck if you have a Tesla.

Measuring a car company by how many software engineers it employs is a useless metric.

Car companies are catching up as well. Kia with their e niro is extremely successful. Volvo released the Polestar 2 which is a direct Model 3 competitor (range & price) but from a well established manufacturer with proper QC and a proper supply chain for parts. VW launched their first EV from their dedicated EV platform, which now means they have the basis for a whole lot of different EVs.

You don't need to be able to afford to buy them straight up, because you are immediately selling them and your broker will cover you. You just need to be able to cover the difference. So at 29 you break even. You buy 1500 at $29 and sell 1500 at $29. For every dollar it goes above $29, you will owe $1500. If it goes up to $30, you have to buy 1500 shares at $30 and sell 1500 shares at $29, so you lose $1500

Perceived value. Everyone's fucking loving it because Elon Musk was in an Iron Man movie once.

Two paintings if relatively equal skill have a price entirely dependent upon the fame and career of the artist, and sometimes, but not always, scarcity.

For the stocks to do badly, it only has to grow slower or stop growing. If people expect the company to grow you will see higher EPS ratios like 30, 40, or higher.  If people expect a company to tread water you will see 20ish EPS.  If people expect a company to contract or do nothing, you will see 10 EPS or even lower like 5.  The market will justify cutting the value of oil stocks in half if they just change from 5% yoy growth to 0.  You might think you have bought a dip, but you really just caught a falling knife.

Yeah, odds are stacked way against you with weeklies. Great potential returns, sure, but unless you have a system with a good win rate, they should be avoided. Small trades relative to account size is fine now and then but I see too many put in way too much into weeklies and blow their accounts.

Ofc Tesla won‚Äôt have the most horsepower and shit lol. But they are the best at safety and everything because of tech. They aren‚Äôt apple of cars, they have crazy thin margins and their model 3s are cheap af.  Apple of cars is a bmw or Ferrari or lambo lol. Tesla is only valued so highly because of their tech not cars... Tesla is extremely overvalued still but saying they‚Äôre only a car company is completely misguided. Go look at how many software engineers they have compared to Honda lmao.

This isn't necessarily true.  Stagflation happened in the 70's.  I think a lot of people are confused on this point.  Inflation tends to happen because of economic growth so most often when these are linked inflation is more of an effect and not a cause.  However, you can have high inflation and a weak economy like many banana republics did in the 60's, 70's, 80's.  You are right in some regards like when the dollar weakens people want to move their money out of cash and into stocks or metals or real estate.  However, like the case of stagflation, inflation being linked to an improving economy and stock market is not always the case.  Economics is more complex than that.

There is absolutely no comparison between watching film in cinema and watching it on 4k TV. It's like comparing driving Porsche to Fiat 500. 100k movies, among which maybe few are really worth watching (talking about new releases, and not classic hits) and rest are nothing anyone would watch in cinema.

That leaves Cinemark and Regal as the two major US chains.  CNK is traded on US markets, Regal owned by CineWorld is traded on the London exchange only. 

These two will have an opportunity to expand their market and pick clean the carcass of AMC which WAS the largest theater chain in the US.  Taking their choice of the best theaters and leaving the trash. Not many buyers for movie theaters...

The moment ARM/Apple announce that they're going to make datacenter server chips, Intel and AMD are just done. 

The whole bottleneck in datacenters isn't how fast a single chip is, it's the performance per Watt. Because not only are you paying for the energy used by the CPU to do work, you're then also paying for the energy it takes to cool the place down again. So you get a double whammy of savings if you have better performance per Watt.
Now I am curious what kind of business you own?

True.  The mix of big boomer money still on the sidelines, fomo, and new gen X and millennial investors looking to jump on the train will be the fuel to keep this party going for quite some time.  As long as there is a steady stream of new money trickling in, the good times will keep rolling.  I have no idea when it ends.

Everyone keeps saying that, but is it really true? Or is this just a case of correllation and not causation.

The money might be cheap, but when most people decide that company stock should be even cheaper, then the stock price goes down.

Why would stock be even cheaper? Because look at how high the companies are flying that basically have no hope in hell to become profitable. It doesn't matter how cheap the money is, when you are not ever going to make money, the stock is worth 0.
So does that mean TSLA calls? Ok all in

Yeah, go check Volkswagen. They already committed $90 billion to developing electric vehicles. And they're not the only car company pumping massive amounts into R&D.
Tesla spends just over $1 billion a year on R&D.

Yes they have a headstart. No they won't be ahead forever. Will they completely disappear ? No. Will they be the dominant force the stock price suggest? Also no.

Honestly, I do come here to check up on the general pulse of the meme community. In some cases there is def some legitimate upside long term, not enough for me to build a large position in my main book, but possibly a flier or two. Airbnb can be a category changer, but 100b is rich and will need to catch up with its valuation. I see nonstop talk about pltr and gme, personally I think pltr can be a long term hold but not a top 10 position given it‚Äôs risk profile and lofty valuation. Gme can literally be a 10 bagger or a zero, sort of nothing in between as it can get short squeezed or acquired, but if left to its own devices will simply bleed into irrelevance. I don‚Äôt touch spacs or weed/ev, but there will be one or two winners long term (good luck finding them tho, it looks like nio may be the front runner for most relevant ev name not called tsla) the ancellary battery etc companies are all garbage

I typically just get out ASAP when it doesn't go in my favor.  Typically have a mental stop. Although sometimes I probably should have a hard stop in case market throws big shit at you unexpected.  I can always get back in.  Sometimes that screws you though if a stock isn't moving or your wrong on the trend. I don't set a percent.  Usually try to be under $1000.

Well, you have to see stocks like real estate. You can‚Äôt just value a property based on the materials that make up the structure, and you can‚Äôt value a stock based just on a company‚Äôs revenue. You‚Äôre betting on its future. Stocks are like Pok√©mon cards, basically. Gotta find your Tapu Fini GX gold and hope it‚Äôs worth more later on.
Closer than ever before
End of q1, once effects of vaccine are started to be felt, and money starts getting directed away from tech into old school ‚Äúconventional‚Äù stocks- not sure this will cause a crash but definitely a correction of some sorts- we are seeing it all ready. Could be worth having a couple of unpopular ‚Äúconventional‚Äù stonks in there just in case, and jump on the back of their potential rise - should help protect against drop in ‚Äúoverpriced‚Äù tech. Goldman are quite opening backing the ftse100 for 7% surge next year (which is tech light but ‚Äúconventional‚Äù heavy)- ok, not massive but gives indication that some companies within the 100 will be well above 7% next year.

Tech is a big driver now. No way around that. Tesla‚Äôs inclusion into the new club is changing a lot of things. The bubble is inflating and you get basically 0% on your money wherever you park it.

Pton is sort of against my typical position, but this one was chosen by a research guy I consult. Not mad at the gains ytd, but typically I look for category changers (think digital payments ma, sq) ecomm (amzn, shop) etc. Pton is a lower conviction but their upside lies more in their potential to become a platform and pivot into different on demand content (think nflx of fitness)

I don't get it, you lost like $8k, can't you just turn a few tricks on the side to make up the loss?

Nothing cements a loss harder than cum drying on your face.
You don't fully know it will bounce to the moon though.   Work on your entries.  It's hard to find perfect entries on longer term swing trades in my opinion unless u get a nice break out trade like tsla at 460.  The reason cutting your losses soon helps is because if you don't and your in a large position you can get really smoked.  Especially when your trading large size.  I equally smoke myself with multiple shitty trades especially if I'm trading a stock that isn't really moving anywhere. $500 to $1000 loss multiple times adds up very fast.
What does that entail?
My advice is re enter and do ONLY 2022 and 2023 calls. Automatically, stuff will sort itself out. The weeklies seem to be like drugs to you so don't do it unless you can stay off the drugs completely.
Gamestop needs to launch an AI electric car research division asap. They'll be trading at $50 in no time.

Fundamentally over valued but not terribly considering other companies. Its pe is twice as much as logi. Crsr has more debt too and less profit and revenue but numbers have been getting better. Technically it looks like its bottoming here might be good to scale in before earnings in feb , also careful there's lock up in Feb. It ran hot as fuk 14 to 50 in little time these ipo gainers aren't healthy. I could see market cap grow next 5 years, gaming more main stream but is still niche market. I'm watching waiting for unusual option activity also cus it's been dead lately. Whole market is frothy so generally cautious on committed longs

I would say they are pretty much there. Have you seen the Audi e-tron? Looks better than a Tesla, and here in Norway, EV capital of the world, hordes of them are hitting the road recently.

Porsche has a great one, jaguar is fairly popular, VW ID3 is crushing Tesla.

The following brands have a EV to ICE ratio of above 90% on new car sales in Norway: Audi, Hyundai, jaguar, nissan, renault, seat 

Ranges are getting more and more similar to Tesla. Up until 2020, I wanted a Tesla, now there are better looking and similar performance options on the marked.

Nice. I keep hearing cut your losses short. How important is that? I have hard time reconciling with buy and hold and seems like in this market buy and hold wins. I understand buy and hold is more for investing and not trading but even in investing people seem to actively encourage cutting your loss. I have been swing trading and everytime i cut my loss i see the stock fly to moon again. Everytime i diamond hand i win. It might just be small sample space issue and nature of current market but how can I force myself to cut loss after loss fully knowing that this thing will bounce back again.

You‚Äôre right now that I recall, wasn‚Äôt actively trading due to capital issues. I got wiped on 2/7 Tesla calls lmao. Bought the 1k hype train.
I didn‚Äôt have any expirations this week, which is why I didn‚Äôt want to panic sell. The addiction of seeing it every minute started affecting my work, why is why I decided to to with a little longer dated options.

The 46K loss was a combination of bad plays. The slow burn over weeks of bad plays.

In hindsight, if I had not let go of PLTR during it‚Äôs meme week status, I would‚Äôve cashed out 74K (had 75 20c, got it when it was 16ish, but panic sold because of the meme status it received here).

Then BILI. Had 12/18 70c, which are so deep in the money now. But I panic sold them.

Not logging in is a double edged sword, I guess. Sometimes it helps to not worry about things, sometimes shit never recovers.

I go to the office, do some accounting while watching trending ticker's all day. Buy the ones that have been flatlining or starting to trend up around and hour before market close (usually 15-20 stocks). 

Then sell at market close an hour later. Usually 30% of my picks are down a few percentage but most are big gains. My next strategy will be buying up stocks that gapped up that day then flatlined or very slowly trended up around 3PM. Then hold overnight for the next gap up. There are so many trending tickers that always gap up 10-20% the next day. I did this one and made 3k. Set to sell at open because I like to lock in gains/losses instead of stressing over the rediculus sell-off then explosion that happens with many stocks within the first 30 minutes of trading. 

I don't know what kind of trading this is called but damn if it hasn't netted me $1k each day for an hour's work.

Airflow is, if anything, a prime example of reinventing a wheel because you have too much engineering headcount. Workflow tooling isn‚Äôt exactly a new concept. And it‚Äôs certainly not the kind of novel, difficult to replicate and maintain type of software that makes for a profitable SaaS. 


Also, the idea that just throwing money at CS grads in Silicon Valley in a start up will somehow churn out multi billion dollar revenue innovation is why people are screaming tech bubble. https://killedbygoogle.com is a good case study in how cool tools don‚Äôt mean long term profitable markets.

The only reason the price has risen so much is because all of these hedge funds know they can pump up the price ahead of the inclusion date and then dump it to every ETF and Mutual fund company that has a mandate to perfectly track the SPX Index.  

Here‚Äôs the play guys:
- short sell tsla next Friday at the closing price.
- buy ford, Toyota, Nissan, and every other major car company in the world in equal proportions using the money received from the tsla short.
- hold position until tsla falls 50%.

From my perspective you have the potential to reprioritize your life and recoup things more valuable than money; such as physical/mental health and relationship with your mom/family. Many of my peers have already lost their parents and there isn't a dollar amount that can bring them back. Nothing of true value was lost.  Just make more money later smartguy üòâ. 

I've been through some shit in life, what helped me most during the low times is taking it day by day. If the days seem too daunting, take it hour by hour.
My thinking exactly. Also it's def priced into everything else, so maybe that stuff is all sell the news and rotate back into more defensive tech stocks?

I wish I stopped in October when I broke even. I wish I could go back in time, but I know I can‚Äôt. Life goes on, I guess. The burden of hiding this huge loss is eating me up from inside. But, at least I have you guys to share it with.

I think for every two corporate travel ticket sales lost you'll gain one digital nomad traveller ticket now free to move about in his/her newly remote job. If this means they won't be selling as many first class tickets you'll just see the airlines strip out spacious first class rows and add more tiny economy rows then nickel and dime everyone on bag fees, and in-flight food/drinks. 

TLDR- The airlines may have to shift their revenue streams but they will be fine.

Taxes are 40% for capital gains, so I already have a plan set in motion and then yes, State taxes always seem to be far more punishing than Federal (I live in Virginia, a commonwealth...we get taxes literally for everything, lol). 

Always said I would retire by 35yrs, I turn 34 in 2 months...the count down clock for me is getting close and I'm extra competitive...even against myself. 

I actually sold off most of PLTR stocks when it hit $30 and have had them since they were $14/$15. Used that money to purchase all the 2023 call leaps. 


Oh and I have like 1500 of Genius Brand shares, again massive research and they bought out like 3 companies and 2 television agencies...but have only moved by $0.50. I was expecting them to be $5.00pr share by this month (December), luckily my calls on them are for May 2021 and Jan 2022 $1.40c (which it's now share price at $1.60)...again, right move, just gotta wait. 

So with everything else waiting to see them pop, I'm actually down to like only $300 buying power. I refuse to sell any of my oil shares, my genius, my GUSH, gold shares, silver shares or anything else.
This message doesn't seem to have any effect here. The opposite situation applies for puts, but fuck it.

Well, we agreed on something in a different part of this post, but I couldn‚Äôt disagree more with you on this one.  

The US government absolutely is going to pay its debts. It always has and always will. It might have to print a ton of money and inflate its way out, thus devaluing the currency, but there is no circumstance in which it would just refuse to pay. That would be the absolute end of things. Game over. And totally avoidable by printing money, so it won‚Äôt happen.

The FS chat was a bad idea.  Wrong guys.  The IVY opportunity may actually bring cash in sooner than you'd expect with some early development deals.  There's an off chance that there's 2021 IVY rev and a good chance of 2022 IVY rev.  If they go there and can talk about some other meaningful wins or development deals, were gonna get a 20%+ move.  Options are pricing a 14% move a little earlier in the week, probably less now.

I‚Äôll try to explain. There is still a lot of time left in that option so it‚Äôs intrinsic value is higher now than when he bought it. Basically the likelihood that it will print is higher than when he bought it, so even though it‚Äôs still not in the money, it‚Äôs more likely that it could be, thus the right to that option it‚Äôs worth more than when he bought it. 


Think of a football team that‚Äôs down by 4 points. Their odds of winning is so much better if they‚Äôre only 4 yards away from scoring than if they‚Äôre 80 yards away from scoring, even though the score is technically the same, the odds of winning are very different. That‚Äôs how time on options kind of works. An OTM weekly is basically worthless but and OTM LEAP can be worth a fortune.

I hate to say it but I too am balls on balls on balls deep in BB.  1200 calls mostly march june and leaps but also a healthy gamble on next friday.  The word of the day for you fucking retards is GUIDANCE.  Chen needs to tell us what the revenue opportunity is with the Amazon partnership (aka IVY) HINT: IT IS HUUUUGE but also WHEN.  When will they make their first IVY dollar. If its in 2021, or even early 2022 watch your fucking butts boys rocket fuel for the quickest double this side of NIO.  

Meanwhile on top of IVY, BB also has 1. a very decent cybersecurity platform  that contracts with major banks and government entities 2. a licensing portfolio that bring in hundreds of mill a year and 3. pending infringement lawsuits against FB and SNAP that if successful will result in a multi billion dollar award.  Everyone also likes their new president of sales from Citrix who is apparently starting to pull in real wins.   

OP is correct, this stock should already be 30bill but boomers feel burnt and most people are still so fucking stupid they don't realize that BB exited the phone biz a few years ago (they license the phone to third parties).  Amazon is taking this partnership very seriously and it will soon be grabbing everyone's attention in a big way.  Open question is why Amazon or another company doesn't see the writing on the wall and buy BB for relatively cheap right now.  30B would get the job done.  Less than that and I don't think BB would do it.  I could go on but whatever, GLTA make money.

I also have like 10x DKNG calls which are ALL red but one, I have $70c and 1x $90c (which is the only one up...)

Everything else is just SLV & Gold...and super 2023 leaps of PLTR. 

So hopefully the Casino-Stonk gawds will find favor in me. 

I'm still gonna work, but probably drop down to part time. I told myself I'm not gonna quit working unless I reach 2mil. I can see 200k in 6-8mnths if things play out correctly. 

But my medical benefits as well as my 401k + plus employer contributions, nope...I'll keep it, drop down to part time and still fund towards that 2mil mark.

Schwab on mobile or desktop? Do you ever do any premarket or aftermarket trading? Were you confused with the buy to open, buy to close, sell to open, and sell to close? I think schwab is one of the better platforms. It may not be so basic but it forces you to learn the basics and I also like their insurance policy on money held by them and their bank.

There have literally been studies showing money DOES equate to happiness (to a point).

In 2010 the Princeton study stated it at 75k. Most young people are making less than that.
Casinos are pretty cool
They do, but stocks don't. Say a stock has 60% margin requirement and you buy $1000 of stock X, that means you can leverage up to 40% of that stock position, effectively buying the stock with $600 of your own money and $400 of RH money. You still have $400 of your own money available to buy options because you used margin to buy the stock. But if the stock falls in value so much, you'll get a margin call and if your option became worthless, you can end up with a negative balance if stock value tank below $400 and now you owe RH the margin you borrowed because even selling the stock doesn't give them enough money.

If you want something reliable for your money to at least make better interest while not moving, check the internet for Dividend Aristocrats.  Utilities (Exelon below 40 puts a 4% yield, AT&T does 6.5% at 30), Large Banks like Goldman, that sort.

Real Estate Trusts (REIT) have been hammered dogshit since covid because most of it is commercial. The outlier is STAG because they do warehouses and light industrial.  Amazon is expanding and needs warehouses.

There are basically two types of EV's: there are modified ICE cars like a Kia Niro EV or a slew of other budget cars modified to have electric drivetrains - and ground up EV's that don't have to follow the typical formulas of car design since it's so much of the design is functional and developed around having a gasoline drivetrain. Most of the cars in Group A are ones you wouldn't really notice are electric except for slabbed over grilles in the front and smoothed out bumpers that don't have exhausts. The ones in Group B are given a lot more freedom to design and I think departing from the formula we're so used to looks really weird to us (i.e. Cybertruck). The Mustang Mach-E is a pretty handsome car, so is the Jaguar iPace, so I think they're kind of figuring out which direction to go in still.

I would guess not market shaking, not fully priced in. Already approved in a few other places. You need to remember that the PFE jab cannot be used by everyone, it does not travel well and it needs to be chilled at -75dC. This means that small town America will not be using this jab. Also most of the rest of the world won't get it either. The MRNA jab does not require -75dC storage and is more stable. This one can be used in most of the world. The astra jab is also cheap and easy to store and transport but they are having data issues from their stufyt, so likely won't be approved anytime soon.

The PFE jab gets credit for being first mover but it is inferior to the other in the pipe.

You lost a ton because you are a fucking idiot. Instead of calling it gambling mention how many safe plays there are, or just safer (selling high IV options instead of buying em)

The simple fact that not one of these companies IPO'd for under 90+% single day price over valuation is all the evidence I need that the whole process needs to be changed.   Too many people shaking hands and jerking each other off at the signing table while retail waits for them to decide how bad they want to fuck us this time.  Scummy and shameful as fuck.  Can't wait to watch these things drop 30% when they come in a penny short of earnings due to their absurdly unrealistic valuation

Meh.
You are spot on. The old attitude was more that if you lost money or went out of business that‚Äôs just tough shit. But now corporations and the rich run the United States, and they aren‚Äôt going to take an L if they can just get government handouts and bailouts.  

Think about how much stocks went down in the Great Depression or Dotcom, or even 2009. The game has changed, and now the government will print money to support the stock market if it falls that much. It‚Äôs basically corporate welfare under the guise of being too big to fail.

If your just starting out start small or what your comfortable with.  I basically broke even for all of 2019.  Not sure if 2020 the volatility has picked up compared to 2019 or if I am just better at identifying trades and actually having the confidence to go for them.  I try to focus on stocks that have some sort of catalyst to move. News/earnings/announcement/significant price level/ degenerate stock.  Tsla is always on my screen.  But earnings plays are typically the best things to have up.  This is after they report I am trading them during the day session.  The reason earnings plays are good is because they tend to trend more than say a random day in any stock.  So then you can believe that a move likely will have some follow through that can make profit taking on your trade worthwhile.  What do you try to trade currently?
What if the government just gives out money? If we can get several more rounds of stimulus, it would help the real economy.

Weekend Dow?
Not including TLDR and PS 1,2,3 that was 13 paragraphs. Thirteen.
November of last year (2019) I was horribly sick and I RARELY get sick, last time I had a cold/flu was 2014. It was so bad that I was sweating horribly, pale as hell (and I'm mixed, caramel complexion) and a headache I could not shake and for the first time in my life breathing was difficult. 

Went to the hospital, they tested me think I had the flu...NOPE, was in the hospital 4hrs they couldn't figure out what I had. They ran every test they could think of (No: diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, HIV, sickle cell...nothing, no underlying health issues), they finally dismissed me and contacted my physician immediately. 
Drove to my physician, he ran his test, told me he had no clue to what I had...BUT told me to take 1.5-2 weeks off from work and to not be around anyone and wrote it off as sinusitis. 

I recovered quickly, only issue that I had after recovery...on the bottom of my right foot there's this dark brownish-red/purplish scar like thing that wasn't ever there and no matter how many times I get a pedicure...its still there. It literally appeared out of nowhere. 

I asked my doctor about it and he said "sometimes a virus can actually leave a physical scar on your body especially if it was something unknown and new/foreign...OR your body can scar you once its created an immunity for a brand new virus/" 

I truly believe that back then I had already had coronavirus and also my white blood cells increased rapidly and he even stated my body was attempting to create a possible immunity for whatever was affecting me.

He was one of the senators that sold all their stock after the private senate meeting. Also has done over 2,500 trades over his 6 year term. Not corrupt at all
at least we have each other

Why anyone would buy puts is beyond me. The market on average goes up and puts cost relatively more. It's like literally donating to MM. At least give that money to a homeless person or something.
It‚Äôs basically leveraged stock. Yes there is an exp. but not it‚Äôs only betting on stock up or down.. you can sell options too and create price neutral strategies like iron condors
Well you see a tesla motor vehicle can cost around 40k fully decked.
I believe that each one of my shares should entitle me to at least one Tesla vehicle. 
Given that exchange is guaranteed by Elon Musks himself, we still have over 39k upside in the next 6 months.
Q1 was rough,  but explainable with the reorganization to using 3rd party and not using warehouses. Q2, FWIW, is gonna absolutely smash. I think 50 before February imho

Right, but those 20 million people buy things and pay rent to people who do take vacations.  They buy shit from factories that employ a ton of middle income accountants, and managers.
eh got burned by them in 07. havent looked at them since .

I know they partnered with amzn right?
This is what I‚Äôm worried about, abnb has tons of good financial news flying around, but if you look at their mentions in normal news it‚Äôs always about how they‚Äôre fucking up housing

You think it‚Äôs too much to ask for? Why?
If you short the vix isn‚Äôt that like saying you want there to be less volatility so you want stocks to go up and down less on average?

WHAT IS THE NEXT MEME STOCK??
I have soooo many SLV (mainly SLV $29c $ $30c) & GLD & Barrick options it's crazy, expiring 1/15. If it passes...I'm omega loaded...if it doesn't....guess I'll be living in my car for a few months. Fingers crossed.

They're one trick ponies. Sure they have brand recognition but it's so easy to duplicate them because it really doesn't take that much to form a similar company that fulfills the same purpose. You can't say that about microsoft, you can't say that about apple.

They're basically the cryptocurrencies of modern business. You can fork their business overnight (not literally but pretty close).

No it's not. 
1.Open schwab broker account
2. Go to schwab branch
3. Ask to sell paper shares. 
4. Sign docs
5. Wait like 2 weeks
6. Get cash. 

Not hard at all.
To add I went in August. Wait until you know the clubs are own if that's your interest. Right now most of the tourist spots are open and even then you could get into the cenotes because the Mayans ran them, but clubs were closed. Also, if you go to the beaches don't let anyone try to sell you anything before you get to a hotel all the hotels want for you to use the beach is for you to buy a couple of drinks you can walk right in, but plenty of people will try to scam you if you stay off the beach strip. Otherwise stores and restaurants should be fine by spring I'm just not sure if they'll be at full capacity yet.
Bro in all seriousness, don't think you're going to learn anything here, you're just going to lose money. People that don't know you will tell you they jerked off to your losses (that's actually really fucking weird) and will tell you shit like go ask your wife's bf for allowance so your retarded ass can buy some FD's. It's actually pretty fucking toxic, at face value. 

But don't judge a book by its cover. Underneath all the bullshit, there's actually something of a community here. There's some funny shit to read and watch, you get to see just how fucking stupid the phrase "there are no dumb questions" really is at least once an hour, and occasionally someone retards their way into a halfway decent idea that pays off. You'll have a good time here, just don't ever make the mistake of thinking this is a place of learnin'.

You buy and sell a call or put at two different strikes/dates, to offset the costs.

So you could sell 12/18 26p PLTR for, say, $1.07, and buy a 12/18 24p PLTR for $0.44. You get credited $107-$44, or $63. If it all expires worthless, you keep all $63. If PLTR plummets below $24, you lose $200 (($26-$24)*100). In between, you'll buy and sell the shares at whatever the rate is.

Realistically, you should try to close the position before expiry, especially if you don't want to actually hold the shares and the long put is OTM, since assignments can apparently get wonky.

I‚Äôm new to options and still figuring this shit out so I got a question. You have an AAPL call for $135. You have +$2787 even though close was at $122 today. How are you up? Are you selling those calls instead of buying?
And that's how it happens. I hope it works for you. I really do.
Indifferent either way but shit is definitely statistically incredible, and big tech is way overstepping their boundaries

I thought from 41 to 37 was a dip today. 12.27 was as low as it got, with a high of 15.15, so 13.50 not too bad. I'm up $100. eod

From WSJ:

1st priority: healthcare workers and extended care facilities

2nd priority: non-healthcare essential workers

3rd priority: people age 65+ and/or with relevant health conditions

So the extended care facilities (where a lot of deaths are happening) are deemed first priority, but the general age 65+ and risk factor population are lower priority than non-essential workers, I suppose to catalyze economic recovery. Great for our stocks, but kinda fucked up ethically

Man things can look and feel so dire.

I never thought I‚Äôd be out from under that. I worked my *ass* off, going my own way (not even what I went to school for), and 6-7 years later completely paid it off and was investing. Seriously amazed about it to this day. It‚Äôs amazing how things can change when you devote your whole being, put your head down, and work that dream into reality. Make it happen brother.

You cannot time the market. 

If you fear a tech bubble, you could mitigate potential losses by dollar cost averaging into a Russell value fund. 

However, the Fed will be keeping rates low for years. The bull market may continue until they increase rates.  

Imagine this dramatic scenario: market goes up 15% in 2021, another 15% in 2022, then the fed raises rates in 2023 and market is -20%. You will have made more having never liquidated your positions than if you fled to cash and missed a 2 more years of the bull run.

Dude walked away with 120k. Sure we were there for like 7 hours and I saw him rebuy in by signing for 40k in chips twice. Coolest part was when he cashed out, they give you a fucking leather satchel with a gold bellagio emblem. 

Best part of the trip was flying back to SFO with that thing in his luggage and seeing the TSA lady's face when she saw what was inside.

Yeah you can request the removal of PDT classification. If your account has been flagged as PDT you literally cannot use it without 25k..just closing and no opening orders.

I don‚Äôt remember how many times a year you can request the removal or if there is like a 3 month delay between each request or something.

No offense that's a gambling addiction. Please go see a therapist. I wish you the best of luck.
I follow this sub for quite a while but never bought anything. Post like yours are a good reminder that there are some yolo successes but also a lot of people on the losing end. Gambling there life away and slowly see it crumble. But you can get out of it. Just don't think there's a quick and easy way.
Airbnb also started buying their own properties. My guess is they will take a hit in a month or two, but once everyone has their vaccine they'd come back up. I do think some people are just jumping on IPO's right now hoping they'll be the next Tesla stock.
I did this all of last couple of weeks. Made some good tendies. But lost quite a bit on NVDA too. So yeah ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I mean, always better than rope. But 8k isn't rope debt. Its a lot, but its not life ruining. I cant remember the cost exactly to file bk, but I want to say the customers I had that filed would pay about 2k for fees and their bottom of the barrel lawyers. Most bks still make you pay back a lot of the debt, just at a slower speed and with a reduced interest rate. That may be state dependent though. Then there are the future losses from increased interest rates and other things I mentioned. It starts looking a lot less enticing. 

And it isn't the only option for dealing with debt. Creditors will almost always work with you if you make an effort and don't avoid them. They don't want to take you to court or spend huge amounts of time and money on collection fees. No one wins there.
the idea isn't exactly unrelated in all honesty, i did think about putting a thing in about PLTR and how governments around the world are piling on to use their software because they're too retarded to make it themselves

Haha yeah when I saw China lockdown I was like ‚Äúoh this is about to be bad.‚Äù They don‚Äôt give a shit about their citizens.

People like you and me took/take this seriously and we‚Äôre skeptical about the vaccine. Imagine people who still think it‚Äôs a hoax or not a big deal. My grandparents live in Florida and said last night that no one even talks about the vaccine there. Imo it‚Äôs not going to do shit and we‚Äôll all just eventually be exposed to the virus..
Personally, I know my grandparents are raring to get on a plane for a vacation after they know they won't die from the pandemic. I'd be floored if there were not millions of Americans with the same sentiment. Long haul commercial flights may make most of their money on first class seats per square foot, but having that entire back of the plane packed like a can of sardines is pretty fucking important too.

Hey man, I dont make much money but I had some vices in my past. Was addicted to gambling at 15 and had consistent cashflow from that, carried that with me until I was 21. It destroyed my relationships, financial, and mental health. I have lost more money than I can even tally up, I tried and wanted to end myself... felt physically sick for a bit. 

This isn‚Äôt the end of the road for you. I know you‚Äôre 38 and going through regret. 
You have so much potential, harness it man. You sound like an intelligent and driven person, you‚Äôre just hard on yourself. Even making this post brought people together. 

I dropped my vices and replaced them with things that really make life worthwhile. Don‚Äôt close this window of opportunity because you have a chance everyday of finding something that makes life worthwhile. Hope this helps.

Biggest thing that has helped me as a day trader is learning to figure out which stocks have the ability to trend.  I originally started trading when I was 19 trading spy futures and lost my first 10k account.  Then in 2008 I tried my luck again and lost another 10k account trading futures again.  Then tried my luck with a prop trading firm where I actually had a mentor that consistently made money in the market.  I still managed to lose that 10k account as well then too.  Worst part was I probably kind of needed that money to and then I witnessed the day the market bottomed in March 2009 and knew it was the bottom but I was broke and couldn't risk trying to buy anything.  But god who would of thought things would go up till basically now. Since then I have made money in another business and I made a lot of money in that and now that business I have slightly lost interest in and have been attempting to day trade for 2 years full time.  Biggest thing that helped me I think is being able to risk money and not worry that I won't pay the bills if I lose the money. I have had several bad days and revenge trading pitfalls.  Biggest drawdown to date was 60k in 2 weeks after one of my best months of making 45k in May.  Even in this stretch I have lost 20k a couple of times but managed to find something the next day and get back on my feet.  I just use a 1 minute chart and moving averages.  Try to find stocks that have some sort of reason to trend and then look for entries and keep very tight stops. If shit doesn't move close to immediately in my favor I try to get out.
Hopefully not

So Ive got a spread, for \~half my share I'm selling short dated calls, and yeah if t drops I'll have to run, but I also sold a 14$ 7/16 for 5$. I bought into GME at 11.50, so anything above 6.50 & I'm green. Theres a chance GME will tank below; but honestly if it goes below 6$ I'm just gonna buy more shares. I do think GME might tank, but I dont think they are headed for a bankruptcy.

Home Depot is up 25% this year but down 5% in the last 3 months and at the low end of its range. 

If you look into details of their technicals you‚Äôll see that Home Depot has dipped to $264 and bounced to the $290 levels less than a month later. Then they went all the way down to $262 bounced back to $289 less than a week later. Now recently we hit the $259 levels and I thought it might be breaking out to the downside but it then proceeded to break out downwards but did not and bounced to the $264 level. Since that support level ended up holding it is now obvious that Home Depot is heading back up to $280-$285 by the end of the month. 

Positions: 12/24 $270 call

**[Dot-com bubble](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot-com bubble)**

The dot-com bubble (also known as the dot-com boom, the tech bubble, and the Internet bubble) was a stock market bubble caused by excessive speculation of Internet-related companies from 1995 to 2004, a period of massive growth in the use and adoption of the Internet.Between 1995 and its peak in March 2000, the Nasdaq Composite stock market index rose 400%, only to fall 78% from its peak by October 2002, giving up all its gains during the bubble. During the crash, many online shopping companies, such as Pets.com, Webvan, and Boo.com, as well as several communication companies, such as Worldcom, NorthPoint Communications, and Global Crossing, failed and shut down. Some companies, such as Cisco, whose stock declined by 86%, Amazon.com, and Qualcomm, lost a large portion of their market capitalization but survived.

I like apple before next earnings, and MSFT which is just sideways for 3-6 months, both have cheap long term calls. 

I bought calls on at&t when it was at 29$ also, if you want long term options target price $35-37 and buy it though it's not as cheap anymore.

Buy GM long calls. They are going all in on the retard EV train, and that's all Tesla types want to hear to throw money in.

Interesting. There could be alternate circumstances at play. Local relationship based lenders are much more likely to lend. Car loans and mortgages still happen because collateral, though I've seen people buy cars with 30% rates because of that.

The type of bk matters, along with previous credit history, though that is typically bad. But alright, not everyone is ruined over bks. And they do exist for a very good reason. However, they can screw you up royally and shouldn't be a solution taken without a ton of consideration.

Your friend is probably an outlier, unless things have changed massive in the last 6 years

Tbh idk that vaccine news does anything, it was expected. If we get new lockdowns and some other bad news, I think we will actually see tech rise Monday and other indices fade, similar day to yesterday with some wonky action. Notice vaccine pumps got smaller and smaller?

Well, the reasons for a breakup are all there, and they‚Äôre solid.  This isn‚Äôt a knee-jerk move, it‚Äôs been anticipated for at least 2 years.  As you say, time will tell.  Zuc has been using his money like a bulldozer, but that‚Äôs an unsustainable business strategy.
Priced in and bullish. The stock market is said to reflect how rich people feel. Rich people ain't getting evicted and the market doesn't care about poor people. SPY June $400 calls is probably free money, or not.
The wealthy and powerful are pretty good at keeping the middle/lower class satisfied with their lives and also dangling the fruit of ‚Äúthe American dream‚Äù in front of them to keep it this way.

Our whole society is based around inequality as a motivation to innovate. I always wonder what the future textbooks will say about our society today.

I think you're correct that there is going to be insane amounts of pent up demand.  However, don't forget about the extra 20 million people who don't have jobs and if there's no stimulus they will be dragging down everything.

It‚Äôs kinda crazy that whoever the biggest loser is in this retarded market was likely playing theta gang. 

We joke about theta gang being all **galaxy-brain**, but those are the fuckers who WROTE the calls to the guy who turned $500 into a milly. 

Bears and bulls can only lose what they put in (and often do). Theta gang gets the **infinite** loss, though.

The jail time thing is separate. There are ways to sort out ones financial situation without bankruptcy, especially if its 8k. That isn't a small amount of money, but its something you survive. My little sister had an ex that essentially conned her and left her with 2x that in debt. She worked and still works at a pretty low pay job. She had a little help from family, but she worked out plans/settlements with the debt holders and is doing well. No bankruptcy or defaults

But yes, if he is going to rope over 8k, its better to declare bk if that is what you're asking. Im saying there are other options and it should not be WSB's go to suggested solution. Very few people really understand the ramifications of bk. It can cost you vastly more than it saves and can cause issues much further down the line than just 8 years

Watched The Matrix again tonight. What a fking FILM.
The science has been worked on for a while, MRNA-based. But I‚Äôm still wary of taking the vaccine. And I was the first person in Chicago to start wearing an n95 end of February (no joke, people thought I was a nut job). This is why I don‚Äôt think the vaccine matters. We need 70% for herd immunity and we can‚Äôt get 50% of the pop to wear a piece of cloth on their face. For all intents and purposes, the vaccine is a placebo, a feel good move. It could legitimately kill pregnant woman or those prone to allergic reactions since none were tested in trials...

There was this time when economists thought that there could not be stagflation.  Then they had to make up the word because it happened.

In July the stock price was at what, 5ish? Any puts they bought then for now would be worthless unless they were super deep itm, but that would have cost them an absurd amount because they would have still lost insane amounts of intrinsic value + theta.

The stock is back in its consolidation range, probably not going to make a ton buying puts on it now. And tbh, its pretty safe to assume that inverting Melvin is an even better bet than inverting WSB at this point. Im not even sure how they are solvent after shorting Nintendo, and tesla. 

Their shorts on gme are probably still profitable, though just barely if you account for interest paid. But if you look at their gme position YTD they are getting fucked sideways harder than a tranny in an NFL locker room

> 1) Cash flow is everything in a company. No money, no growth. 

depends

GME is a good example of having cash, but no growth. a lot of their cash has come from selling off inventory, their corporate jet, and the main headquarters in grapevine (which they've leased back). they've also cut executive salaries and cleaned up their accounts payable

they're sitting on a shit-ton of cash because of streamlining the company processes, yet their revenues throughout the year have been down significantly. their gross margins also suffered in 2017 and most of 2018, until they sold off the spring mobile business at the end of 2018, which they had acquired in 2014:

https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-acquires-wireless-company-spring-mobile/1100-6416309/

in 2019, the current management came in. gross margins improved significantly, and were looking up until the pandemic hit:

https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/GME/gamestop/gross-margin

in the last earnings report, it was mentioned that month november comparable sales are up 16% Y/Y, likely due to the new console cycle, which might be a good sign

i think it would be better to compare to the previous console years. nevertheless, the CEO mentioned that this will be a strong quarter

looking forward, it is highly unlikely the company goes bankrupt as they are well-positioned financially, and, again, the new console cycle will give them a boost

the company and the stock mechanics are separate though. as an example, most of big tech posted great earnings last quarter, but all of their stocks were dropped after and have remained mostly flat

GME stock movements are highly unpredictable. it does strange shit, and this is why placing bets on it is foolhardy. what's more is that everyone and their grandma knows GME shoots up during console cycles, and that's why the financial media, cramer, etc. will shit on the company more to shake people out, and introduce doubt

logically, yes, the company should do well the next quarter, along with most of retail, and GME in particular because of the new console cycle

unless you're on the inside though, it's impossible to know what will happen with the stock
Interestingly enough, gold and silver seem to be responding to gravity after reaching highs.  It's impossible for a retard to understand.

Just put in another 4 hours on Cyberpunk. Theres so much more junk to loot than skyrim, witcher, and fallout put together. They need to drop less stuff and make it worth more. I did side missions for like 3 hours and did like some upgrades and crafting and I had to empty my inventory like 7 times. In 3 hours. Really frustrating. Your apartment is such a run I don't want to run and go to the stash so I can dump it all there and sort it later. I've just been selling as I go. I didn't realize the inventory management would be such a pita. I hate to just pick up green stuff because I need the parts badly. I dont even have full synth upgrades in every slot yet, even shitty ones. Trying to get all those before proceeding with the storyline.

Hold GME at our own risk. And so you know I have no interest in this play. Don‚Äôt own the stock, ain‚Äôt short the stock and don‚Äôt give a fuck about it. But I don‚Äôt wanna keep seeing you fucking retards keep losing money on it when there are soo many other plays that are safer.

Yeah. Pfizer wasn't in the warp speed program, so the current administration had nothing to do with it. 


What he did do was only order 50 million doses and refused to accept any more at Pfizer's recommendation, which means we can't get enough until 2022. It's going to other countries.

So the only thing he really contributed was fucking it up.

Its an old picture he found somewhere i believe (pretty sure I've seen that a few times). He may be slightly off, but the story is very similar. The difference this time though, is that the squeezes happened before the console launch and profitability returned. Now its looking like it may not happen until q4 reporting March. A strong quarter will add to the squeeze and the vast short interest could make this a hedge fund killer. But we shall see!
I hope you turn it around in other aspects of your life man. Good luck, stay healthy.
It's simple: they suffer zero political repercussions for doing so. Trump  already lost and is on the way out, and McConnel is already extremely likely to control the senate next year. The worse this gets, the more people will blame Biden the very second he takes office. Which means McConnell will once again have all the political leverage.

More like thetacurious...
You guys are insane. Pfizer is a massive company with hundreds of revenue streams. Their vaccine branch is like 0.001% of their total revenue. Even if their vaccine profits increase 100x this year, that isn't going to send their stock up 20%. More like 2%, or 5% in a euphoria overbuy.

Their stock only went up like 3% when their vaccine was announced as safe and wildly effective, the very first effective vaccine in the world. And that is way bigger news than an FDA rubber stamp.

Lmfao don‚Äôt be a fucking offended ass snowflake because I laughed at your ignorance on the subject.

Also Intel hasn‚Äôt been the leader of semiconductor manufacturing for years. They are a leader in SALES. TSM is a Semi-Conductor FOUNDRY which Intel also deals in, but they haven‚Äôt even gotten the hang of the 10nm process yet for over a decade and will most likely be exiting that part and just having TSMC manufacture their chip designs. 

Also no, running away to the TSMC factory wouldn‚Äôt do shit since Trump threw a tantrum this year and TSM no longer makes chips for China. However their demand was so high that that still maintained full production and companies still fight for production lines. Notice how new generation NVDA and AMD graphics cards, AMD, Xbox and Ps5‚Äôs are all almost impossible to get a hand on these days?

What a shitty company and management! Management and shareholders probably gave up at this point. Management probably just there for the paychecks.

You guys are crazy to think Intel and IBM are good tech plays.  I know  people who have contracted through Intel, IBM, said it's basically the worst tech companies to work for, little to no innovation.  

Top grads aren't going to these places to work, or even good workers.  You only choose these places to work until you can find a better job.

Their CEOs don't even have a major plan to turn this ship around, or the tech background to right the ship.  And as other people are saying IBM and Intel are fudging the numbers.
It's only a bubble only when you don't have positions.

What is false Dropbox acquiring then?
The puts are certainly important, but its the actual short shares that'll ultimately trigger everything. While mms have to hedge those puts, the further they go otm the less they hedge, which I suppose is like its own little mini short squeeze providing extra fuel to the fire for whatever direction we are going. This would hold true for any stock, but the massive number of options held on gme and the illiquidity of the stock means it is more influential than normal.

Kinda thinking outloud there, but all that to say, they dont have to close those puts for the puts effect to be reduced, unlike the shares sold short

You mean PLTR?
Hmm.. I should do this.. Kind of noob question..   
I know that higher price long calls are cheap.. But does it fetch same profit as lower calls?  
For ex: If I choose 1/15 125C for AAPL and it moons to $145 -- $x profit  
If I choose 1/15 140C (for lower price) and it moons to $145 -- $y profit..  


Does it fetch me same profit? (is x == y?)
Let me check my crystal ball
yeah so what

I think Kayla is sexy af
So you got lucky once is what I‚Äôm hearing
I did my DD for this company back in 2017 lmao it‚Äôs a pump and dump, I wish I was keeping tabs on it to catch it before the rise but at this point i don‚Äôt see it running up much more, maybe if you buy now you could potentially see 20-30% in the short term. But if you hold too long it‚Äôll eventually dump 30-40% in a day and have you feeling real dumb.

If you bought before this big run up congrats OP but this ship has sailed

Best way to learn is by doing, bud. Wait for a mini PSTH dip in the next 2 weeks and buy a long dated 15C. It's the safest way to make money with options (ITM leaps) (ignoring selling CCs)
Doesn‚Äôt the 224% increase suggest this is fake? The graph is set to Monthly view and there is no dip down to  $12k, so $12k is the lowest value in the account for the month. $12k to $322k is an increase 2,584%?

I mostly I agree with you but when people don't have jobs or have taken significant pay cuts some amount of that market share just goes *poof* as people can't spend as much or need to recover savings they dug into. Also there's still no plan for all the rent that's been put off for 8 months as eviction has been held.
I keep my covered calls premium. We are both right.

You guys are all making great points and I essentially agree with all of them. But it's not a zero sum game. There is room for multiple entities. gme doesn't need to be best or better than most to survive and do reasonably well. I think you are confusing my personal point of view here with others perhaps. I don't think gme will hit a home run but I do think they will hit the ball and get on first base. Again I can't reiterate this enough, you don't need to have the best product to survive as a business.

Some are yes, but they need brick and mortar retailers to deliver still. And gamestop has extremely strong attach rates. Meaning if someone buys a console or anything else from gme. Its very likely they pick up a few more things alongside it.

Disk less consoles make up 20% of the console market, which is multiple times larger than last gen. Games are massive, and the disk less only hold a few at a time. Many issues have data caps now, it would cost me an extra 30 to download cod this month....and another 30 if I removed it for something else and wanted to play again in the future. External drives won't play ps5 games.

Eventually it will be all digital, but we aren't there yet for consoles, and gme is preparing for that by expanding into other areas of focus.

People out there actually think scentists make vaccines. Scientists come up with the recipe/makeup of the vaccine/medication (or alter a previously proven one). Vaccines are manufactured by mostly complete autists ranging from 21-30 years old getting paid 18-29 dollars an hour. Corners are cut on the reg to get home to play COD. A vaccine hurried this quickly (fast track program is usually 5-7 YEARS) will fuck some people up guaranteed. Not taking shit for a vaccine to save some super boomers from kabooming.

I think you should get greedy. 

The US has unofficially been adhering to whats known as modern monetary theory for some time now. Basically, we are like the only country on earth that can pay it's debts in the same currency it prints. China wants to be that, aint gonna happen. But pretty much the theory goes that we can pretty much print an infinite amount of money without worrying about inflation. Rather than view our GDP and national debt as lines on a budget, we really dont need to give a fuck about a budget. We run the financial world, we run the world militarily, we essentially run amok low key and unchecked and it's glorious. All we really need to worry about is our resource budget-aka- human laborers,  and whether or not countries buy our debt. As long as we can sell our debt, we can continue this orgy. And who wouldnt want this to keep going? Look at Europe, China. They all worship the QE gods now. This shit aint stopping, cuz if it does, the stock market will literally be the last of your concerns. It's an experiment that is almost certainly doomed, but it will drag the whole world down with it. There are many vested interests in keeping this paradigm going. Don't be a gay bear, just live good while you can and buy calls
Fuck off . Hope you lose a lot and hop off your high horse.

Everyone talking about buying VIX calls means we‚Äôre gonna have a green December just to really fuck the bears

has any of you tried listing print on demand shit and living accumulating the cash flow? Some people are making thousands a year benefitting from the increasing traffic on shit like Redbubble and Amazon Merch, and I figure that this market is just getting started. Imagine when brick and mortar stores just die, people are just gonna shop online where they can have more choices on designs and shit. I think I'm gonna start doing this on my free time. Just a plain t-shirt with some meme quote or some shit sells if its on a subject where there's not yet much competition

Shoulda got warrants, man. 690 warrants got me around 200 shares value, IIRC. Much like stonks only go up, SPACs never fail to reach a deal so warrants never expire worthless.

I will probably regret this in a few years but I can take out a 1.5k subsidized student loan. Since it's subsidized I only have to pay interest when I graduate and even then loan rates are super low. These are the only few years I'm able to just pack my shit and go. So since I can't take a long vacation very easily once I start working, wouldn't it be a good idea to take a long road trip all the way to the grand canyon relatively soon? My body won't even be able to pretty soon. Money is less valuable when you get older and have a full time job compared to being a college kid. 

Though the alternative is to make money from stonks and option to pay for it. Half my portfolio is in tsla shares I don't want to empty out. If arkk keeps going up I'll be able to pay for it.

Sorry to hear this friend. I personally think WSB gains posts should not be included in Reddit's front page. People get drawn to all the gains and easy money without realizing that a lot of it requires tons of luck or years of studying, and usually both. 

I've been in your shoes before. You're probably going to go through the whole 5 stages of grief. Just know that this is probably the lowest you'll be in your life, and there's only room to go up. Take care of yourself mentally and physically. Start small and work on financial stability. Don't worry about FOMO. The market will always be here, if you ever do return.
Avoiding large losses is the single most important factor for winning big as a speculator. You can‚Äôt control how much a stock rises, but in most cases, whether you take a small loss or a big loss is entirely your choice.
"crying like a little bitch" good! That's okay! 
I had a brief stint with a gambling addiction where I lost about $1,000 that I didn't have to lose. This was when I was in my early twenties. I was also chasing my losses, sure but what I REALLY was doing was avoiding confronting my emotions over losing money. I couldn't accept the emotion, therefore I couldn't accept the reality. 

When shit sucks, it sucks, and you got to accept it. And if you can cry, then that means you've finally broken out of the denial and you are actually in a healthy place.
Actually didn‚Äôt get shit from their deaths honestly got fucked over by insurance ü§∑üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è takin care of my younger bros through trading tho; it all works out in the end

CRSR has done nothing but enter new product categories in a competent way.

Those killer GPUs and CPUs that keep coming out gotta go inside something. Most of the computers I see on reddit getting upvotes have a ton of Corsair RGB.

Interest rates have been zero for most of the last decade . So it cannot be used as an argument for such insane valuations. March rebound gave a taste of massive returns in short period to many new investors.  It's just people sitting at home bored and addicted to highs .

I have replied to this exact question below..people like to think of tesla as some tech or power company but none of those make up a significant portion of their revnue or profits. The market cap of the largest solar company in the world- first solar is ~9 billion dollars..lets say teslas power/energy dept is worth 20 billion for good measure..you are still left with a company with ~558 billion market cap that doesn‚Äôt make any profit(without tax incentives)...tesla as of today isn‚Äôt making any money through tech..the tech is included with the car for free and updates are free..the money they make through selling full self driving package goes towards research,no profits..the revenue they make through selling acceleration boost is neglibile..tesla doesn‚Äôt make any profits through charging stations..they have already said they don‚Äôt intend on making superchargers a profit center (https://electrek.co/2018/03/11/tesla-increases-cost-supercharger/) .. as far as batteries are concerned,many companies are getting closer to teslas battery performance...google how far gm and toyota has come with their solid state batteries..toyota is releasing their ev sometime later this year or early next year with 500kms range and 10 minutes full charge time.

Yeah. This is just a dip. When adobe flys it can move $20+ in a day. Buy shares and hold. Good long term prices at these lows.
I'm retarded but not that retarded to hold that long. Looking for premium gains and then to dump it on some other sucker.

You have to realize, that the margins in gaming are tight. Almost all the money is made  on accessories like controllers and charge stations. The systems are sold at cost or a loss and the games are sold just as tight. 

So how does gme exist without a margin whore to float them?

Who doesn't.
They are THE leader in semiconductors. Comparing every other semiconductor company to TSMC is like comparing ants to fucking lions. The only ones that that can even be said to be competitors aren‚Äôt even competitive to what they do. Intel is failing and has resorted to getting tsmc to start fabricating some of their chips this year. Samsung is putting up a noble effort and initially got a deal with NVDA but NVDA dropped them and are back with TSMC because Samsung could t even handle what they required. 

Who do you think actually handles the physical production of chips for Apple, AMD, NVDA and countless other companies? Their production capability and quality is huge and unmatched, yet all their production lines run at 100% or near 100% capacity year round, year after year because they are the only ones that can do what they do. 

TSM aren‚Äôt building a fucking factory in the US because they wanted to. It‚Äôs because the Pentagon identified the fact that a huge part of its economy relies on TSM and to the point that it‚Äôs a national security risk. The US BEGGED them to build a factory in the US.

i agree with you on how china isn‚Äôt a superior country but i don‚Äôt see how people keep spewing stereotypes about how most of china lives in poverty etc. It‚Äôs as if they straight up refuse to believe how technologically  advanced china currently is. Anybody with actual experience with chinese people will know most of the stereotypes aren‚Äôt true lol. Sure there are some chinese companies that were involved in fraud/ lied about their earnings etc but it‚Äôs appalling to see how because of afew bad apples, all chinese companies are immediately trash, imagine applying the same logic to nikola for example them lol
She cool af
I'm not sure why this sub is so bearish on oil. Do you think developing countries give a shit about emissions? Or that any serious electric airplanes are getting approved for 30 years?

Dude, why?

You might want to look up "real rates" and how they correlate to precious metals. 

Also, next time just buy silver futures and set your stop loss to correspond with your yolo dollar amount. It's also a leveraged bet and theres a much better chance you walk away without losing it all.

You can only choose the $ amount you plan to invest and it places a market order. You will get fractional shares as a result.

2) everyone gives out payouts for service based on contracts previously signed.

But before that I get to tell Kanye (msft) which buffalos to preach to

Maybe "airlines" but what about ONE airline? 


Because certain airlines are going to get canibalized in the aftermath and sell off their fleet, and others will get the spoils. Some airlines will get massive bailouts and tax incentives while others will be left struggling. 


Nobody is going to go out of business yet for a while because there's still free money to get from the government.

In fairness, the wife said it was going on for two years.

Do the math. He drove right into the crash. Then he got out of position and bet against the recovery because all he saw were headlines saying to party like it's 1929 and buy $ROPE.
"If they fail to grow their revenue and hold on to unprofitable assets and revenue continues to decline like it is now, it won't matter how much cash they currently have. They will face inevitable bankruptcy."

That's what I was talking about.
