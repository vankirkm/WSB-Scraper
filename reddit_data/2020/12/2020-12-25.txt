 Re-reading your post - yes agree it makes sense to be at an all time high more often in normal circumstances. I suppose my point is it shouldn’t have reached an all time during the COVID pandemic, but it has due to monetary policy

Buy leveraged shares then, you can even buy more with the profit while it goes up (and hopefully during the squeeze, as it is low enough volume) if you use leverage.

The engine themselves in the 747's are RR engines? I could be wrong there. But if that is the case then engine makers would probably take a hit more than BA. They do these test flights for a reason and could just be faulty engines from the manufacturers.  
Edit: Could also be old and outdated planes/engines.
Hmm wonder if T is gonna take a hit Monday.

Yes, the person who you sold the call option to will exercise the option to buy 100 of your shares at the strike price if the stock goes higher, or you can just buy back the call option at any time before the expiration date if you don't want to deal with the hassle.
Good looks homie I’m all over that
how many shares of SPY do u have to make that much weekly on covered calls
I'm just taking it at face value -- which is basically all we can do as ordinary citizens -- The dems (Pelosi, Schumer) turned down a bill which would've been very beneficial to us months ago in fears of Trump getting re-elected. Even AOC has called those two out.

It is impossible to short with the float so low. At IBKR the short fee was over 800% on an annualized basis. You need it to drop more than 2% per day just to break even

I think I was down 30% at one point, but Baba is a volatile stock so I expected that. I knew a break either direction was about to hit, and based on the recent news about Baba and risk in a China, I bet that the big move would be to the downside. I trusted my DD and held it out.

I don't have a price target. I have a shorts cover target. when the short position is less than 100% of float, I'll consider selling.
There’s no free money out there. Just think of it as a somewhat less risky and less levered way of holding a company compared to outright shares. If that’s something that fits your individual portfolio goals and strategies is your call.

This is making me a trillionaire Tuesday
$qs put premiums are crazy high. Iv was over 300 even on feb options a few weeks ago.
If you retards and autists think stock market is overvalued now, cryptocurrency is over Pluto
Your dad is gay
You buy 100 shares and you sell 1 call option. If the price of the stock reaches or goes over the call strike price, you're forced to sell your 100 shares at the call strike price, or buy back your sold call. If it doesn't reach the strike price, you keep your shares and premium from selling the option.

It's called covered because you own 100 shares so there's no risk of losing money if the options get exercised. You collect a premium (option price) for your troubles, but limit the amount of gains on your shares.
And who hold the goods after their mined?
I think most of the GME's longs around here are actually millenials. Gen Z is into weeklies/FDs, confirmed by so many "I threw my  student loan into the meme call option of the day, YOLO tendies" posts. Their patience runs out after a day and their forward thinking is limited to 7 days in the future.

Exceptions exist ofc, I'm talking in general...

Bonds are a lot more stable than stocks are - you are guaranteed a fixed income and rarely have to worry about capital losses unless you want to sell your bond and interest rates have gone up. 

However since the fed has been pumping tons of liquidity into the market, interest rates are near bottom and can only go up from here. So there’s literally no point in buying a bond right now.

This is how I feel, and what’s actually happened, 4-5 times now. Made $10k+ in savings 5 times between ages 16-19 and every single time it disappeared even though I didn’t splurge it or spend it on me.

You have 100 shares and get paid to agree to sell it at strike price by expiration. If it's below you keep your shares, if it's above you sell em

What is better to buy? Common or un?
I mean... the best advice I've gotten was from One Up on Wall Street with "invest in what you know." My best gains so far have been in health care stocks. DXCM (wearable blood glucose monitor) (albeit down hard recently, but still up quite a bit over the past 2 years), INSP (implant for sleep apnea) (over 100% gain), SEM (long term care hospital chain and urgent care chain) (30-40% from the start of the pandemic), and GDRX (pharmacy benefit company) (up 30% in the past month because of it being oversold when Amazon announced their pharmacy program). 

Being in medicine, it's easier to see plays then, say, buying GME (Which I own because I'm more autistic than The Good Doctor).

They say that blatant scams such as Nikola target stupid and weak minded individuals simply because those are the only people dumb enough to fall for them.

Same thing with Nikola investors.

Was a couple months into quarantine and had nothing to do, so I decided to install this trading simulator on my phone because... uh. Anyway, I told my friend about the app, and we had a competition to see who could end up with the largest account value. I was actually doing well and was up 2k, and then I found this sub.

At first, I didn't take any advice from here, but after seeing some juicy gains I decided "what could go wrong I'll just put a stop on my order," and YOLOed my entire account into one stock. The next couple days after that I lost everything. Reset account, and repeated. Eventually decided to learn what the fuck I was doing wrong, and opened up a real account and started learning how to trade. 

Started off with 1k and then make it to 2k. Got super cocky, and in typical wsb fashion, YOLOed all of my money. Lost almost everything (at 400). Fast forward one month, and I was back at 2k (stopped YOLOing). Didn't put in stops on a couple trades and went down to 1k. I was so discouraged, but then I thought "hey this stock looks like it's going to go up imma buy," then YOLOed my entire account on AAP like a boss. Back to 2k in one day.

Fast forward another month and I'm at 5k. Fucked up my order and switched to a market order instead of a limit order. Biggest mistake I made in a while, lost 400 instantly. Decided to revenge trade (don't know what the fuck I was thinking) made 300, and then.... well, I was fucked. At 3.7k. Thinking to myself again "hey this stock looks like it's going to go up imma buy," At 4.4k. Had to hold because of shitty PDT rule and was back at 3.7k. No problem just diamond hand. Back at 4k next day. Sell immediately.  

Now back at 5k. Good luck everyone. Hope your calls don't expire worthless.

If you are asking this then you probably shouldn’t make this move.
My bets are game stop will have a much better run in the next month or two compared to vale, vale does show promise but if you’re talking straight shares I’d be more on GME than vale (I have multiple options on vale throughout feb, April, June, but bang for your buck GME might rocket in the next 3 months vs vale in 6) this is just my understanding of the market. I can’t say that if you put the money of 300 shares of vale into long term MT options (June through august in my opinion) they WILL print and be significant profit, just more long term.

Trust me, as someone who's been investing in the market for a long time, 2020 was not a normal year. Even with the 30% crash in the beginning of the year, we're still going to outperform a lot "good" years. We had probably the most bullish 6 months in history while the real economy was stagnant. 

When life returns to normal, I don't think the market will be so forgiving. Until then, try to squeeze as much as possible and keep locking in profits on the way.

Thanks! It’s not large in these specific positions, I only have 300 GME and 300 VALE. I guess I’m also questioning whether or not VALE would do as well as MT/CLF and whether or not the steel trend is sustainable, or short-term as well due to steel prices spiling in near term. Appreciate any insight there.

how much you want to bet that career traders are using foreign bot accounts on wsb in a multi-national market manipulation scheme. And that such a scheme, even if it were to be unraveled by a previously unknown youtuber, would technically be 100% legal because more than half of congress is too old to use a computer effectively, let alone introduce legislation to adequately address the most serious threats of an increasingly digital age.

Excellent job! But in a year or 2 you're going to realize "your thesis" was completely wrong, unbelievably wrong, however you timed a dead cat bounce really nice....Had patience that nobody has, enormous balls, etc.

But anyways, Gamestop will not be around in a few years so hopefully you don't get married to the stock and incorrectly believe there is "huge upside" and minimum downside. A few earnings reports down the road, declining financials, dead ghost town stores, the company is doomed and can't keep up with their rent. This will be a penny stock, go down to zero, delisted, and file for Chapter 11 screwing all investors. Only a matter of time.

Boeing went down the shitter almost 25 years ago when they merged with McDonnell Douglas and took on McD’s shitty management team for some stupid reason and started taking profits above safety. There are probably still gremlins left in that airplane; I’ve read stories from Boeing engineers, it is still a total shit-show in that company.

As an A&P mechanic, I can tell you the 737NG (the previous model) had most likely a similar engine failure issue as it was coming back into service earlier this year. Airplanes that sit a long time develop expensive, dangerous problems. Airplane mechanics are for the most part paid terribly compared to the sheer responsibility your license gives you; Airlines kept planes parked in the desert and the guys they contract through shitholes like Aersale to take care of them are overworked, underpaid, and shit WILL slip through the cracks. The shit I’ve seen just skipped over by underpaid overworked mechanics is honestly pretty terrifying.

i kind of figured it was because once you HAD to stay at home you realize you never gave two fu$ks about your house inside.. then “oh god i live in a sh$thole” realization hits.. and wife’s got you ringing credit cards $$ on crap at homie-depot.  “work from home”.. but that’s while you still got your 401k cash in the market.  when it runs out.  .  hmm but, you have thinking about fires and riots.  and that goes to WY.  i have Egyptian Blue Walls now.

Started as an r/investing virgin back in 2017 when I got my first job.

After a year later I realized there were people making 100% gains in less than a week.

And thus the gambling started. I started small, if I remember 500 or so. Made my first 200 in a single trade from a yolo in BU.to back in January, thought I was the shit because of that and within 6 months I was down 15% with a net deposit of 3000. This year I'm gonna have a net gain of 0% unless GME is gonna moon before new years.
I didn't know it was on the ATT building. That shit looks straight up like Barad-dûr
I feel ya man, it sucks to think you’re pulling off a smart move only to see the market make a fool of you. But it’s okay, a long term hold and averaging down should allow us to be in the green long term. Proud of you for not panic selling. It’s a risk worth the gamble if you ask me. Let’s hope for good news next week 🙏

Whatever anybody here tells you, including me - take it with a grain of salt. We're all guessing.

Comparisons to VW shortsqueeze are pointless. This is not the same situation. There were only a few long holders with VW and they held a fuckton of float. GME is held by tens of thousands of longs.

GME setup is somewhat similar to TSLA setup maybe. But, now you're comparing an unprofitable gaming retail brand with shrinking revenue to an EV brand that has 40% yearly revenue growth or sumshit... I think we might see slow burn growth in 2021, where GME grows 20-50% every month, but I can easily be wrong as fuck - we could see a whole lotta sideways days with an occasional "retard rally" day like this week's Tuesday, where the stock jumped 25% and then continued moving sideways after that.

I will tell you, as much as I'm consumed by all this myself, I am aware I don't know enough about most of the stuff that pertains to this GME play. I own shares too (231 shares bought at $15.4). Been researching this company since September 2020, I'm convinced this is a 2x for me, I consider 3x realistic and hoping for a 5x. If GME doesn't get squoze, I'm most likely selling everything at 5x.

Having absolutely no exit strategy is about the worst situation to be in. So my advice to you is to consider whatever you know and think, evaluate all of that and then come up with an exit strategy.

For me personally, if the short squeeze DOES get squoze, I'm selling everything at 10x ($155). I don't believe that will happen. But if it does, I'm 100% doing it.

So, make up your mind, come up with a plan, and stick to it.

The good news about the nashville attack is that it was Not a random act of terror. This was a strategic attack to take out ATT communications building for some reason.

If you want my honest opinion, if you’re on Steel/materials,  Mt or CLF are the way to go (X still risky in my mind) but GME is much more likely to spike short term. Idk how much you’re talking but everyone buying shares not only increases the odds of a huge short squeeze which appears imminent. I don’t know how large your portfolio is but if you’re looking for short gains it’s GME, but long I would look in MT👀

All depends on the stocks you’re working with and the type of options you’re selling. I believe credit spreads and selling calls against leaps (poor mans covered calls) works pretty well for smaller accounts.

Check out r/thetagang for some of this stuff too, idk all the ins and outs on those. 

I’m very fortunate to have a somewhat larger account so I mostly do covered calls and puts but I know people who do theta with smaller accounts too and are successful.

This is exactly the short squeeze situation in the reverse. So if either side had the opportunity it feels net neutral. But I will say this, a backroom deal feels way harder to pull off when one side has all the leverage.

Weekend Quickie DD:

Steven Cohen’s Point72 Asset Management’s 4^th largest holding is $PLTR. Worth about $285MM

ARKW has only bought ~$36MM and is the fund’s 50^th largest holding. (Since their last 13F)

If each WSB autist gets stimulated with a lump sum payment of $2000 from our weird Uncle Sam and buy PLTR we can purchase roughly $2bn of $PLTR.  About x6.5 the amount purchased by the above funds, combined...

Best of continued luck.  I'm shorting shares + Jan21 210p and I unfortunately let myself go far beyond what my normal risk tolerance is this time.  I was late to the trade and I'm only a little ahead still after the small rally intraday Wednesday.  I'm trying to steel myself emotionally should there be a Monday pop.  I was imagining a 20-30% drop near term from the close on Tuesday based on my own retardation.  See you at the bottom.
Dang that’s amazing! Those are some insane gains. I definitely would Diversify if it were me. I’m skeptical of long term bullish outlooks and I feel like putting all your eggs in one basket long term is very risky. I like to swing trade more than invest tbh. 

I’d also play SPACs if it were me since you have a floor so you know your maximum losses when going into a play. But to each their own. Nice job man.

yes i know that meme isnt it a bit old for u to be talking about it?

what about something which is a new trend like megan thee stallion memes?
Wrong. ITM Calls cause Market Makers to buy shares to hedge.
Don’t you need to have like at least 50k to do this strategy
Interesting to choose your calls based primarily on their price tag but I’d probably go with ITM 1/2022 calls. Maybe 17-20s. Tons of vol already priced in so any higher and you’re gonna need some running
Wow what a retard, didn't even invest in Planter's Peanuts like the rest of us.
No.
Yeah I learned that now lol

It’s cool tho. The amount I’ve learned in this past year from going balls deep in options instead of just lurking is wild.

Very excited about next few years esp after starting to do theta gang shit combined with autistic gambling

correct on all but CLA .  anything related to lidar , is memeable now. you are just missing out on free gains if u refuse to roll with the memes .  and again, there hasnt been a single ev spac where if u got in early around 10$ then u lost.
nope. just an awful movie.

Comrades! We might have a problem. 

Found this article about the price of iron ore dropping as a move by China to combat the ever high prices of iron ore. The price has only continued to rise to new highs in the past couple months, as I'm sure steel gang members know. We need the omnipotent insight of steel daddy, u/vitocorlene. Let us unite and go to the moon. 

https://www.scmp.com/economy/china-economy/article/3115256/china-australia-relations-iron-ore-prices-drop-after-dalian

I am no stock enthusiast by any means... I worship the teachings of the steel daddy. This article just made me second guess the potential market takeoff of steel.
Why isn’t Christmas on a Sunday? I’m ready to fucking trade again
you and OP have a special place in hell reserved for yourselves
i am currently taking a bath on my jan canoo calls as well. but , dont fear . the price is being manipulated down right now. i believe by closing under 18 yesterday, it broke the streak it needed of closing over that much for 10 days straight which wold trigger a stock lock up sell off possibility. people have noticed massive buy/sell walls as well around 18 and 24 levels to make sure they dont get past them. institutional buying has been going up while little guys like us are getting shaken out.  if u noticed also that in the past few days canoo has opened at premarket up around 10-20% and then instantly gets sold off to erase all that. someone is pushing hard to keep this price down. lets hope that they are done wit the games sooner then later because this stock definately has the ability to go to the 25-30$ range. i think by jan we will see it around 25.
Ouch!!!!!

I’m by no means an expert. But generally NAV is about $10.00 per share. Sometimes they are a little lower or a little higher but most sit around 10.00. 

PSTH for example is a HUGE spac and has an NAV of 20. That is an extreme exception 

I’ve noticed that sometimes they can fall slightly below NAV. Not sure why this happens, but it’s always good to do some research before you invest in any spac. Research helps get rid of paper hands or prevent unwarranted diamond hands.

After work from home started in March I began tinkering with 17k and made 7k.

This year my job announced that there would be no raises company-wide (this was a lie as I knew several people who got raises). This angered me. I started working less and investing more during my work day. I saw it as my own form of protest, not necessarily against my company in particular, but also against American big-corpo at large. 

So far I'm up 100% from a start of about 40k. 2021 here we come.

I guess Trevor comes out as a real billionaire. He probably already dumped some of his shares. It's a crazy world.

When a great company like Tesla IPOed, the entire Wall Street went short. 

When a scam company like Nikola came to market, they went long and pushed it up 900%. Many people pointed out Nikola doesn't have real value. I tried to warn them. Anyone who lost money long NKLA deserve it.

Bro there's a legit reason why 2000 and 2008 were seen as fucking golden ages before they happened and as fucking cataclysms to normies like us after the fact. 99% of everyone here is going to have a great time up until the last moment. So, it might not be popping soon but you're still going to get fucking gaped by big money in the end retard.
The only thing I can tell you is that, if you are in this to gamble on a 2x-5x in a week, this ain't it boi. I can totally see GME's price being stuck between this $19-$22 wedge for weeks.

Then again, I think this is a 2x-5x (if you buy shares) if you buy now and wait at least until June 2021, possibly even until the end of 2021.

If you don't have patience, go find something else.

Not so much. As an an analyst, your associate or your VP should be checking your work. Face to face <alone> would never ever ever happen in your first year.

First year, my VP had me work on a presentation where I got about 3 hours of sleep across two nights. We drove to the client the second morning, and I was unconscious in his Saab convertible (sunburn manifested a day later).

We arrived, went to the meetings, shook hands. My slides went up and he talked to them. Lights out for contrast. I was unconscious agin, instantly.

Time passed. He pointed at me, passed out, and proclaimed to the client, "that's how hard we're working for you." Everyone laughed. I woke up. Success.

More float needs to be locked away by billionaire funds/entities. The float probably needs to be closer to 20 million, rather than 40-50 million that it is now. Even then, too many paperhands are gonna sell too soon.

Personally, I probably wouldn't be able to diamond hands past 10x ($155, bought in at $15.4). That's 2 years worth of income for the 10 seconds it takes my slow fingers to tap tap tap the smartphone screen.
Is that for all the dicks you'll be taking every which way?
Depends if OP is a high school gymnast
Being over 100% short literally means there aren't enough to sell in the squeeze situation.  Even if retail paperhands.

This IPO would be the biggest in history for WSB. The memes would be off the charts.
This is why Zillow should invest in a $PLTR contract to increase their accuracy. in short, buy $PLTR
....it doesn't work like that.
PLTR is developing a tool that health authorities plan to use to monitor the manufacture of coronavirus vaccines and determine where they should go. 

CRM is more of a hospital administration level. Wouldn’t be surprised if PLTR tools integrates with salesforce to some degree.

You want to be profitable? You’re in the wrong sub.
That’s me. Except I was smart enough to not go to the gathering to begin with
Me neither. In fact, I'm more interested in that scenario. It's more realistic. 30-50% growth every month, instead of retarded 500%+ spike up in 2-3 days which you can't possibly time correctly - you're either gonna sell at $120 and then it somehow shoots to $200 because no reason, or logic in the irrational market - or you're gonna wait to $200 only to see it fall down to $120, then panic sell on the downtrend.
Wife received an inheritance, and she has no interest in the stock market or investing, so it was up to me. Didn’t wanna be the guy that the extended family points at…”that’s the guy that lost his wife’s inheritance because of his stupid investments”, so I started out very conservatively (started out by putting it into a money-market bank account at 1% interest, and then withdrawing from that a little at a time to invest in the market). This was in mid-May of this year. I was so averse to losing money that I actually bought bonds as part of our investments, plus some value and dividend stocks. No options, only shares, and started seeing some success in mid to late June with days when the little portfolio was up on various days, 6%, 7%, almost 8%…so I was encouraged. I kept buying and adding to the portfolio adding a lot when the market took a downturn—by mid August I was seeing regular days where the portfolio was up 10% or more. September was bad, and there was one day when our portfolio dipped to well under 1% total gain…I reacted by spending a small fortune on stocks, but damn, it made me nervous. Sold the bonds and bought more stocks. October was up and down, with our highest days at about 18% and our lowest around 6%…I continued to buy the dip. Things started looking up in November, the first month with over 20% total gains, and the month ended with consistent days of gains around 30%, and the good news continued through December, with our most recent trading day over 41% in total gains, and our high for the year thus far being last Tuesday, with total gains of almost 45%. We have over 100 different stocks in our current portfolio, with heavy bets on EV, solar and U.S. weed stocks. Biggest winners by percentage have been QS, BLNK, JMIA, SPWR, & ENPH. Biggest winners by dollar amount have been JMIA, TSLA, SPWR, & ENPH. Biggest losers are HYLN, BABA, BIGC. Things are going very well and I’m optimistic…and none of the extended family are gonna be pointing at me as “the loser”.

Thanks! I do a lot of research on r/spac and here as well. I look for trends and do some dd on the companies that Sound interesting to me. I Also try to ride the hype train a bit.

I’m sure there is a good bit of luck but I try to make safe plays somewhat near NAV. 

If it’s higher than 13, I better have some strong conviction that it is a company with something special to offer. 

I dump them once I feel like they’ve had most of their run. Don’t get too attached to any of the companies. For example, I exited sbe at 32. I could have kept riding but it was becoming more dangerous and I’d rather put my money in something safer and do it all again. Did the same with ciig

yes sell all those shares and buy option call expiring 1/15 for $30 strike price. sell when you are up around 300% or so. oh and let us take your lambo for a test spin ;)
It’s called hot wheels retard
Yeah, unless it’s a covered call or cash secured put, you can get fucked pretty hard due to assignment. There was some guy a few months ago that ended up paying 10 grand in borrow fees when he was assigned a short NKLA position over the weekend lol

That's the problem with your generation, you think you're owed something. That's just now how it works. Get a job in the parking lot behind your local wendy's and then go yolo that money into any random meme stock with weekly FD's and lose your money like the rest of us bitch.
Holy shit. Calm down Chad Dickens.

In April 2018 I started lurking on WSB. I saw what you guys were doing, and truly admired your courage, but I knew you guys were just fucking around. All in Apple weekly puts? GME calls? Again, you're there mentally but you're just not taking this seriously. I have nothing against that, but personally I go hard.

The story begins in July 2018. I ran quite a bit of math and formed a plan. I would use all my money to buy 5% ITM SPY calls expiring in 2 weeks. When those calls were at expiry, I'd sell them and purchase new calls at the same strike (or slightly higher to cover the option premium). The idea is over time as long as Spy kept going up I would eventually lower my risk and start paying less option premium, and eventually probably start buying monthlys.

For awhile this worked great, but one day stocks went down. I lost everything because Trump said fuck China (fuck China btw), and decided to take a break while still trading a little. I was sad, but I knew one day I would try again.

October 2019: After saving up for a year just in stocks, the second trial begins... this time with a new strategy: put spreads and leaps and oh my god were the returns fat, especially on the put spreads. Put spreads provided some steady income while while the leaps were just plain good. This is the strategy, and at one point I was pretty confident I was set

And then covid hit. All my put spreads went ITM but I kept selling more into the drop thinking that the premiums were just too fat, but little did I understand what a pandemic was (even though my gay bear friend called me about the virus BEFORE the crash and told me to close positions. Fucking legend, but blew all his profits on Macys puts lol). My greed got the best of me, and even my leaps started going (quite deep) OTM. At my lowest point I was down 40k from the peak.

I didn't close my positions, and the day trump announced stimulus really turned things around. Even then, I did have to pay out a little bit on some of those final puts, but I still had like a few grand and my leaps. I used the few grand to sell really ridiculous put spreads because like fuck it good premiums and my account is fucked anyways. However, to my suprise stocks didn't go down after that... ever.

I made a profit of about 55k since the bottom of covid, and am now much less leveraged than I used to be (only about 3-4x now). Over time I have moved out of selling options and I mostly trade futures now., but I still hold those leaps (Dec 2021 300s and Dec 2022 330s). I also have a LOT of shares to insure my futures, which I know is gay but comon guys ever think about taxes? You'll wish you did if you ever end up in my position.

The full story in image form is available in my last post.

You can only exercise the long leg. You sell the short leg so it’s not your choice whether to exercise or not - the guy on the other side has to decide and if he does, that’s when you get assigned.

Max profit is realized at expiry so to get that, you have to hold and let your broker clear it for you (exercise the long and be assigned on the short). 

You can sell early but you’ll never get max profit. In fact you usually can’t get anywhere near max profit trying to sell an ITM debit spread the day of expiry

Don't buy during the first trading hour after market opens on Monday. GME price tends to spike up sharply during that time window. Wait for it to drop $0.5-$1, cool down mid-day, then all-in.

Been watching GME's price action for weeks, glued to a chart like a fucking drone. It's been like that on most days, other than that retard 25% bull run on Tuesday.

Maybe there will be less of them but they will still have their place. It will have 0 effect on current ones with a DA, may make it more difficult for ones without an agreement to find a target or a good target though. 

My guess however is most of the companies that would go the SPAC route still will, maybe a few of the unicorns that would have considered it won’t now but for the most part I don’t think you see much of a change

Third, I’m glad you were able to pick up on one of the 7000 posts here and jump onboard and regurgitate this post with nothing new to it. The only real substance here was the experiences you shared with us about your wife. She sounds like a nice lady.

It is just a little too much GME in here. There is no need to raise the level of awareness. Everyone that wants in is in. Go make a post like this about MT. I have calls.

Miatas awesome. Rear wheel drive, 50/50 weight and no driver assist. No one I know of has ever driven one and not loved it, super easy to learn stick on too. 

I’ll be honest - it may be a challenge to find a decent one for that cost depending in your area but don’t give up. 


Cars in general not really besides YouTube. But for Mazda specifically: Miata.net is an incredible collection of info for miatas specifically and people are always willing to help. CarPassionChannel is great too on YouTube. He can basically reach you to strip a Miata down to the subframe and put it together again.

I usually close early at 50% of profits. I don’t let them run until expiration. You get the credit up front once you open the trade, but then you have to buy it back

I think there’s a lot of hopeful people that could see these gains and be okay putting them all on the line since their way above their initial investment.  to the moon or down with the ship.  even if he loses everything he had the ride of his life.
It really is regurgitated crap — these fucking retards that think and say blatantly wrong information that there’s a difference between HK and NYSE BABA.

You don’t make money until you close your position.  

When everyone does the buy and hold thing - it makes it seem like everyone is a winner. The problem comes when everyone wants to make a claim on their “gains”.  When everyone wants out - everyone loses. 

This book teaches you about fundamentals because you need to be able to recognize when to exit.

Google dude. People in here will give you the most wrong answer just to see your loss porn. But seriously dude. How are you gonna make money on stocks and options when you don't even care enough to research your own questions. You're gonna lose your ass bro. Really think about this. You are asking complete strangers important questions about your money. And you can't even be bothered to look up the answers yourself. Anyway. Rerolling cost 3 times what you first paid. You will also forfeit 20% of your premium. Think that was a wrong answer? You should research and see if I'm right dude.

Can confirm, all my extra money is in GME already (231 shares $15.4) and I'm only angry at the choices I made over the last 10 years of my life, choices that led me to a position where I don't have more than $3500 to throw into this guaranteed win.
It has to be GUH. Feels like it was about 2 years ago though. Last year it was so obviously “box spread can’t go tits up”.
Lol. I was looking forward to the market opening tomorrow. I am an idiot, it is Saturday. When I used to smoke cigarettes it used to be torture having to get on a plane or anywhere that would not let me smoke for a few hours. Now that I am into trading markets being closed on the weekends has given me a similar feeling. Can’t wait till Monday...to lose more money!

Cool - thanks man. I’ve gone in pretty big on PSTH, which is also worth a look. Our man Ackman sounds like he’s on a mission.

Well these weren't tenants but literal bums I'm mostly talking about. If it was working tenants who had fell on hard times I would do everything I could until my hands were tied completely. My ex wife was less understanding than I was but oddly more understanding of the bums. I hated being a fucking landlord and would never do it again.

I appreciate the positivity... I do not feel financially stable. I feel like at any moment I could get insanely sick or a family member could... or I accidentally hit someone with my car and get sued, or my investments tank, the market turns... properties get destroyed somehow.

I don’t feel financially secure. I have a paranoia something or someone is coming and everything will go away and I’ll start from day 1 all over again,

Funny you mention those ideas. I was honestly thinking about opening an electric powered hotdog cart after I get my cybertruck. I was thinking to get a neon sign that says “electric lunch” with a lighting bolt.

Charge like $3 for a hotdog, chips, and a can of soda.

Lmfao. It’s the opposite problem really.
I wouldn't say unlimited upside but it should not hit much resistance until 35-40 range so anything before that is free money.   


I was telling people about CARR when it was in the teens based on fundamentals it should be 32-35 with comparable companies within the industry and no one listened. If you look at the multiple DKNG and PENN are getting, this could hit 60 by next summer.
I was there several times in December. They were packed. Can’t go tits up.

Edit: also the marketcap is under 100 billion which I find ridiculous. It gotta be worth 300 billion at least.
I feel like this is such an obvious pump and dump on Monday. Positions? I’m not looking for long term plays, but I might load up on some calls 2 months out. Revenue growth is expected to grow again this year, and I see ads for wish everywhere for it
I started years ago probably before WSB existed. My boss at the time took me under his wing and kinda opened the door to stocks and options. Back then a trade commission was upwards of 15 bucks and I had a spreadsheet to do the math on break evens. 

I played with it with small pennies not doing options. Only recently when finally using the knowledge he gave me to get into options did I finally realize this MF’er didn’t retire early because he hit the lottery, he made it big with options. One day in his mid 40’s just up and walked out like a baller. Bought a new truck and hasn’t worked since. My dream

I read the book years ago. Whatever you read, take it with a grain of salt.

Many people think buying stock with low P/E is the way to go. They are wrong.

For example, Costco stock gained 410 fold in 38 years since IPO, plus dividend.

It's P/E ratio was always above 30. Right now is 37. But Costco stock was always undervalued.

Some people will say Tesla P/E 1200 is too expensive, but it's actually undervalued.

Anyone who uses P/E to value a stock basically doesn't know how to value a stock.

The key is predicting risk adjusted future cashflow. This book doesn't talk about this.

We've had a bunch of rain here lately. I woke up to my (unfinished) basement flooded about knee-deep. It's not uncommon for it to flood, (it's really just a concrete floor and concrete walls, we don't keep anything down there), but the pump died and we didn't realize it. It got high enough to cover the bottom of the water heater and short out the lower heating control unit. So, yeah.. got to play plumber today. Somehow I don't think my adventure is a sign that the market will be up Monday.
The virus will, question is will these lockdowns go on that long

I literally remember going to buy more puts on it and then looking at the price ($5 I think at the time) and realizing I couldn’t get far enough OTM for it to even be worth it lmao

They are merging with Paysafe. They are a company sort of like SQ. Recently I jumped on board because they came out that Microsoft is now accepting payments via Paysafe. Do some dd on Paysafe and make your own decision. One potential downside is if merger doesn't go through then share price is back to $10 and that's what you get but that's quite unlikely.

What a wild year, I went from quitting my job with no plan b back in January to making more money than I’ve ever made in my entire life. The world is really what you make of it.
I sold a couple 22 4/16/21 MT calls on Friday for a nice profit and converted that into GME shares. I’m still holding my contracts for MT @ 24 C 3/19/21 because I believe those will still yield a nice profit.

Just saw the commercial too. Looked pretty dope. lol'ed at the 69k price tag tho
>If you normally sell a product at $600/ton and your margin is 20% - you are making $150/ton.  
>  
>With increases you sell the same product for $1000/ton and your margin is 20% (maybe more for an integrated manufacturer like $MT) your margin is $250 per ton.

&#x200B;

If there is a global supply shortage, will companies like MT be selling less volume overall? If the margins increase but the sales volume drops, they could end up with roughly the same profit level, no?
If you’re worried about fees it’s not for you son

When i was born my grandfather set up a dividend reinvesting account with disney and harley davidson stocks. Today i still hood 65 shares of disney in that account (at 19 years old) and sold my harley shares early december of 2019 to purchase company stock at my work place (Publix). At the same time i also moved 2,000 from my savings to a td ameritrade account now sitting at 2,937. At one point it was as high as 3,500 but it came back down a bit through typical newbie trades. The past two years i’ve been mentored by my grandfather on fundamental trading and creating passive income through multiple investment vehicles. It wasn’t until about 3 months ago that i became interested in technical swing trading and options. This was the result of my 3,500 account balance down to 2.9k. I don’t blame the style of trading nor the market and completely understand my lack of knowledge is to blame. This is why my christmas list this year was filled with books relating to technical trading and more short term investing wile learning to manage risk. I’m excited to learn and see what i can do over my second year of trading with my own cash. I plan to keep my company stock as well as my disney shares as a safety net to make sure i still have a huge safety net. My goal is to find a happy medium between investing long term benefiting of dividends as a small income and swing trading along with some other investments outside of stocks. I’ve had many good trades and many bad trades but my knowledge of risk management as really helped not blow up my account. (small side note. My grandfather would give checks in birthday and christmas cards through the years written to the brokerage to my account. At the time i didn’t understand and was frustrated with the lack of money but now see it as the best gift he could’ve given. My main goal in life is to be in the position to do the same to my kids and grandkids to set them up for success while passing down my knowledge to them.)

Serious answer : not relevant anymore , money is free with how FED acts, everything looks like a decent risk /reward with 10Y below 1%,  none of that fundamental things like price  to book are working anymore because they can’t capture IP value( amazon , salesforce ) , brand value ( apple )  , hype ( Tesla ), etc , you can’t put $ number on those things , either takes shots at individual stocks or buy VTI and don’t bother reading

Father passed away due to COVID in April and left me 150k in life insurance. I’m 21 now. He was a first generation immigrant workaholic and always did his best for me being single father. He even started working as a dispatcher at a university and got me free tuition and a student job at the department. In 2018 he won the lottery with 100k after taxes and he blew more than half of it in under a year. He helped his family with some of the money and got a much needed car but he blew so much in so little time and kept sinking money into the lottery. With nothing but an abstract thought of stonks I suggested investing it but he waved it off. Well, because of this I decided to not do that and put some money away and grow it. Was gonna do a Roth IRA but that’s for pussies. Did some DD on Tesla and around mid November and I was able to go balls deep into it by convincing my mom. I’m usually hovering between 50%-60% all time on my portfolio. I know he’s proud of me and what I’ve been able to do given this opportunity. Thank you guys for making investing seem less daunting. And the laughs this place is fucking hilarious. If ark is correct with their outdated projections, I’ll be a millionaire before 30. Thank you papi <3
I mean personally, making $15k overnight on 1 TSLA call was cool. But PISS DRINKER. I'm still not fully sure I really saw that. I hope he had a good Christmas!

Watch one episode of mandalorian and it should be pretty obvious to buy AMC puts and DIS calls. If you’re a conservative investor, buy DIS calls and AMC far OTM calls as a hedge. This is the easiest trade you’ll ever make, second to only INDA

They’ll roll out a new supercharger port with every new EV release. It won’t be backwards compatible so your 2024 Apple car won’t be chargeable by any super chargers that Apple installs in 2025.  

To force you to upgrade every few years they’ll push OS updates to it that reduce your max speed, acceleration, or make the car take 3x longer to respond to any inputs.

> I suspect that most--if not all--of the downward price action lately is amplified by end-of-year tax loss harvesting. In other words, there's no fundamental reason for there to be a sell-off other than for non-specific reasons. We should see a bump in mid-January '21, as new funds rotate back into NKLA.

Invested a little bit in college, mainly holding index funds and individual stocks like MSFT and AMD in my Roth IRA. But recently, I have been trading SPACs with tons of leverage. I put in 50k of my own money, borrowed 50k on a personal loan, and then doubled my buying power through margin. I made about 60k on T H C B (Microvast merger) and 90k this week on G H I V (United Mortgage) alone. I paid back the personal loan and withdrew some money for taxes. I now I have about 200k in PSTH (100k margin). Reply with what sort of motorcycle I should buy lol

Right, but they *could* pivot and claim more realistic technologies and products and become a more traditional company, especially with new management. If you make reasonably priced EV semi's and score some decent contracts they could be re-ignited. 

Don't get me wrong I think it's a pile of dog shit in it's current form and wouldn't throw money at it, maybe not even until they start making decent sales. 

I just think with how the market is right now, you don't even need a viable product to attain a multi-billion dollar market cap, which is nuts.

This line of reasoning would hold a whole lot more weight if we didn't see first hand in February how the market can keep mooning in the face of bad news. It knew about covid and China supply lines for almost two months and finally decided to crash in February.

What I took from that is the market can climb a wall of worry but can fall right over it as soon as it reaches the top of the wall.

Wtf? Vix puts retrd
I'm currently using an europoor money transfer/management app (Revolut), which also offers 'buy/sell shares' functionality as an afterthought. I have microdick budget ($4.6k) and I didn't lie my way into Interactive Brokers or some other more reputable platform that want smalldick $20k+ budget investors.

I'm all in on GME, so I'm good for now.

Bad thing is, this app only has a few hundred different stocks you can buy/sell. Good thing is, I can wait to withdraw this money in 2021, maybe even 2022, and pay my taxes for that year instead of this year. This is legal where I live, the tax man only cares about my bank account income statements for now. It could change in the future.

In your retard opinion, am I shooting myself in the foot too much for trying to postpone taxes eating away some of my current gains? In other words, is the downside of not having access to thousands of different stocks outweighing the upside of tax reporting flexibility?

For example, I couldn't do your STIC play, because there's no STIC in Revolut.

Thank you and [DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/user/DeepFuckingValue/) for confirming my GME conviction btw. I was into this stock since August/September, before I was even active on this sub.

This is a fascinating thing I've noticed among Nikola believers: the idea that the problem is a damaged image or reputation. The reason for that damage is totally overlooked.

Here's why they won't get past the damaged reputation:

The reputation was damaged because they don't have the technology they claimed and are incapable of producing the stuff they claimed they could make. 

They literally can't do the things they said. They can't achieve the things they would need to achieve in order to make and sell things.

This is like trying to explain to someone why we can't just get past the bad press of hitting an iceberg by selling tickets to go on the next voyage of the Titanic.

Yeah, I get that from a lot of folks. I realize that it hasn’t really been a very customer-centric company and it left a shit-ton of long term angry customers like yourself. I totally get that - it’s not natural to invest in a company we have bad feelings about.

Yeah, I don’t think I’ll ditch VALE completely, but maybe convert to leaps and sell poor man CCs - I don’t see it mooning and it’s tying up too much capital at this point. I’m also not betting the house on GME, I’m not that kind of a trader. I think it’s highly unlikely, but GME going tits up is one of possible scenarios.

If you sold the 34c 1/8 exp you make $1872 from about 36 contracts. Worst case scenario you have to sell you shares at 34$, which is more than what you paid for them.

Do that for a year that is roughly 50k in gains

[ArcelorMittal receives $505M cash, 78M common shares of Cleveland-Cliffs and non-voting preferred stock redeemable for ~58M common shares or an equivalent amount in cash from the deal.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/seekingalpha.com/amp/news/3642967-cleveland-cliffs-closes-deal-for-arcelormittal-usa)


This essentially means $505M and 136M common shares of CLF. This makes MT quite a big shareholder as those 136M would account for appr. 25% of all outstanding CLF shares after the redemption of the 58M redeemable stocks. As the market stands right now, that deal is worth $2.423.960.000, or just under $2.5B, but that probably becomes even more if everything goes to plan. 

In other words; if you believe in both of these two companies, buy MT as that will expose you to them both while buying low.

But yes, it is of course possible that CLF is the better choice but that would affect MT, while it does not work the way the other way around with MT affecting CLF. This makes MT quite a safe bet and CLF to more of a gamble. Yet, it could be argued that the stock market in generel is very much gambling, if you are short-term.

Side note: I could be wrong.
That one trade in after hours was a $2.3 million buy. When I saw that come through, I instantly got hard. This upcoming week should be incredible.

I was thinking Jan 2022 - calls are still cheap. 

Why bail before earnings though? Genuinely asking.

It’s pretty much impossible for them to be IV crushed and there’s plenty of theta on those calls being 30 DTE at the time. Also, they should do well in earnings, unless the go up too quickly before them.
Those 290$/share prices were of a different era, when there was a shortage of monosilcon raw materials and FSLR’s CdTe process did not have the same materials constraints.
Have a large position I’ve sold short calls against over the last few months. Last lot are currently in the money & I will be happy when the shares are called away on 1/15.
I will look to re enter through short puts if this plunges after Q1 earnings.

With all the GME and PLTR it might be a great way to really see how we as a community can do!
Shares is safer and the way to go if you’re new to this.  It also helps everyone and will still likely make you a solid return on your money.  Regular investing types aim for like 10% total return on their money in a whole year- you can (probably) easily make a 50% return just buying the shares and holding until April.

Been reading since 99.  First big loss was shorting phone.com and on 8/12/19, portfolio was down 80% overnight.  Then by thanksgiving that year, turned it around and was up 500% riding AOL call options all the way to time Warner merger.  Was trading w parents money and after I made the money back, they told me to go back to college and quit trading.

Many bubbles and crashes happened in between.  Was stubbornly shorting the market from 2011-2015.  Then eventually last year, started to trade more market neutral.

Had some big runs this year.  One in late March taking 120k to 900k. And more recently 30k to 280k last 5 weeks.

2019 and 2020 have been pretty good years for me, but it’s been a long road trying to fight the fed.  So now I just take it day by day.
This makes me so happy. Thank you

You can change every aspect of your lives with this one play. If you've gotten burned before following some retarded DD, you just have to shut off that doubt.

It was a planned attack. Thats obvious imo. My speculation is that he wanted to go after At&t. Maybe he or she (the voice was female) was fired from a post there, and she decided to black out their entire communications by blowing it up.

Because they know a squeeze is inevitable so now the strategy is to spread rumors that the top couldn’t possibly go past $120 so people set their limit orders to that price instead of $1000.

Get yourself a nice set of tools and buy an older gently used vehicle. Even if you don't know how to fix shit, there's gonna be a video on YouTube explaining how to fix it. This will save you major $$ which you can use to invest and make even more. When you eventually get rich you won't have to ask questions like this. Instead you'll be asking what color Bentley you should buy.
Stop doing options. Just buy and hold. Pls. It’s so easy not to lose money in the market right now.

You're just making shit up in your head. Sorry, it's not going to happen.

You guys should have learned from Covid that reality doesn't give a rats fuck about what you want to believe.  So far this year, Exxon has cut $10 billion, or about 30 percent, of its capital spending and slowed projects around the globe. It may consider selling some assets, and it’s been borrowing to avoid cutting its dividend to shareholders, which has long been seen inside and outside the company as sacrosanct. After insisting for months that it would avoid the layoffs that have battered other oil producers—more than 40,000 jobs, or 14 percent of the oil and gas workforce, have been lost in Texas alone this year—Exxon chopped 1,900 jobs at its Houston-area offices. The cuts came after the company said it will stop matching contributions to employees’ 401(k) retirement plans in October. Oh, and its lost 60% of its market cap.

Real bright outlook there. I'm pretty sure that aging boomers are suffering mass hysteria due to brain damage/brain deterioration.
What do you think about XOM? 8% dividend and 60% upside.
First TSLA dip.

First of all, every fucking call you buy should be OTM. Second of all, if it’s a leap, it should be obnoxiously OTM. So OTM, in fact, that if you were to tell someone about your position, you would have to repeat yourself two or three times. Finally, buy AMD leaps and not intc leaps you rat bastard.

Just for clarification Tesla’s model 3 gets a range of 263 miles while the Chevy bolt gets 259 miles if we are comparing similar priced cars. Now for the Porsche taycan that’s not competing with the Tesla. Just because they are evs doesn’t mean they compete with each other.  Right now Tesla is able to sell the cars cheaper because of the huge government subsidies they receive(this is what many people believe led Tesla to become profitable) and unless they upgrade to solid state batteries they will be at a competitive disadvantage with regard to charging times. Now let’s talk about charging stations. If the government mandates evs do you really think they will allow companies to have their own charging stations or will the government deem it a utility(like electricity already is)? I think Tesla has serious potential to grow in the ride sharing space if they can get a fully autonomy’s fleet but other than that I don’t see how their sales can justify their share price. Their autonomous driving software isn’t a market leader with Waymo holding the number one spot. Waymo is a subsidy of alphabet and gm has their own autonomy’s driving software which a lot of analyst rate better than Tesla’s. Again it’s hard to see how Tesla will ramp up their revenue while increasing their margins. At the current stock price compared to any of their financials Tesla is overvalued and it will need crazy growth that is sustained over the next decade for it to grow into its valuation today.
Would love to be in the loop for that

Any profits made before years end will be taxed. Better to sell your positions JAN4th and pay taxes 2022 on anything that you’re holding this late into the year. Also, many Jan earnings calls after a shit year. This is when I’m expecting a sell off so 1-2 weeks from now. But I’m scared to bet against the economy so I’ll wait until after the sell off to buy up so like mid Jan to beginning Feb

Am I conveying properly that there's a very hard line you can't cross? Fresh DD or reading the existing DD is the only reason to buy.

Honestly the stock price will likely move up significantly eventually just based on the algo trading and how disconnected fundamentals are, but with that said I think it goes below $10 for sure in the near term. If they somehow repair the whole reputation of the company and actually start making and selling shit it could be a good long term play.

Youll learn not to chase the ones who arent interested. I can tell if a chick is interested in the first minute of talking to her.  You are too busy chasing one you wont get and probably ignoring chicks that are clearly interested. 

And the true tens, like actual super models and shit, if they were interested they would have made some kind of move. Chicks like that dont need to play stupid games.

AMZN has been a option killer lately.
Omg have I been here that long....
I bought Prevail Therapeutics December 8th shares and calls when the stock price was $10-$11/share and a few days later Lilly announced they were buying them out for $22.50/share and that is how I became addicted to call options. I turned a couple hundred dollars worth of calls into a few grand and I’ve been chasing that high ever since. I just wish I was a little more retarded when I bought the calls and had bought more

Edit: I know this isn’t a CRAZY return like a lot of people but it was within my first week or so of getting into options trading so I was hyped. But I guess like they say, the first ones free.

There were several big threads about nashville that were suddenly locked and censored.
I'm in the process of rolling over all my M1 assets to Fidelity. You should check it out, so you don't have to liquidate holdings prematurely (see ACAT Transfers). M1 is for long-term buy and hold with a pathetic 1 trade per day at market open with 0 owner/price control, or with M1+, a 2nd trading window at 12:30pm for accounts over $25K. Disgusting. The only thing I liked about it was M1Borrow, but not worth it for all that trash.

In this retard bull market, as long as you have more winners than losers, you profit. It's only a question of how much.

I have a microdick budget, but I've been going all in on 1 or 2 stocks hard since November 17. Lost money on a few swing trades, but most other trades were green, and the recent GME megarally puts me at 50% gains after less than 40 days.

I doubt I can keep this up, I still don't fully understand a lot of factors you have to consider when doing things this way, but as long as my winners outweigh the losers, I'm good

Exxon reported a third-quarter loss of $680 million. That’s a big number, but it’s actually an improvement from the record $1.1 billion loss it saw in the second quarter. So far this year, Exxon has lost a staggering $2.4 billion.

So Cleetus, watch that Fox and enjoy the ride down you dumb bastard. Fuck boomers are stupid.
Here’s my wild theory on the Nashville explosion:

It was some kind of oceans 11 shit. I’m serious. Think about it: it’s christmas day. All businesses are closed, including banks and museums and other places which could potentially hold a lot of expensive shit. That’s why the explosion happened outside of the AT&T building and took out a lot of AT&T service in the state: it was intentional, in order to make it easier to bypass some security system somewhere that was on the AT&T network. On monday, someone is gonna go into their bank or museum and realize they got ripped off.
No apology needed. You are right where you belong.

Mad World starts playing.

Guy wakes up, again in bear costume, it's all a dream, his flat is a total shit tip, cigarette ends, beer cans and fast food everywhere, used and scrunched up toilet roll on the bed. Pinned up on the wall is a Belle poster and a fucking PROFIT/LOSS TRADINGS CHART. Guy flips out, attacks posters, falls back to sleep, fades to black again. Attacked.

I mean, I get the GME skeptics, I really do, but it’s one of the most beautiful stories of transformation, underdog, David vs. Goliath of these years and I just can’t help but hope for it to win. 

I think its “meme” status actually isn’t really motivated by pure greed, but people whose feelings resonate with what I described above. I think people genuinely believe that GameStop can be the ugly duckling that transforms into a “swan” of gaming e-commerce and stick it to all the big monay nay-sayers that thought it was dead and buried and easy money by shorting it to death.

I think I’ll make this a post.

EDIT: oh yeah, steel probably is a safer play, steel ain’t going anywhere, although it’s unlikely that steel prices stay this high long term and steel stocks will fluctuate with it.

Well, the topic of this thread is the linked study, so there is no reason to bring up efficacy studies. Apples and oranges. No reason to compare to those.

Naturally efficacy studies are done differently. 

The objective of a phase 1 study is to determine safety, immunogenicity and sometimes dosage range. Why are you not satisfied with the methods, although the study clearly presented results for those points. Efficacy is not for phase 1 studies.

Efficacy will follow later.

As you resort to ad hominem attacks and generally rude language, it is clear that you are losing the debate or can't face the facts. Trying to direct the topic to unrelated directions is also a mistake.

BFT is one that you want in before a merger date is announced. Also one of the few SPACs you're going to want to hold past merger unless you just want fast tendies. Just be prepared could be a couple months before the huge upswing. But once that starts its not going to stop. Personally I put half what I was planning to invest in it the other day. If it drops below 14 I'll throw the other half in and be patient. That's what I'm doing at least.

Imo you are are so wrong about printing. I’m bullish on INDUSTRIAL applications for 3D printing. I think you’re conflating people using it to make coasters or DIY projects at home with aerospace, automotive and other serious manufacturers doing rapid prototyping. High strength polycarbonate is perfectly functional for prototyping and even some mechanical applications. It is faster than molding plastics because you don’t need to fab the mold first. Traditional CNC is great (mostly for metallics fabrication), isn’t going anywhere, and is much better for high volume production lines true but that doesn’t mean there’s not value add for a print shop at a plant. Everything my experience in manufacturing tells me shows this to just be a fact as far as I’m concerned.

Consider also the flexibility of a 3D printer and related material. This is an extreme case, but just as an example: if were planning a mission to Mars would you send one of every tool you think the crew might need? Or would you send something that can make any tool or structure they want (and that they can design on site) outside of extremely high strength metals or specialized materials. Every kilogram you send costs thousands. The more that kilogram can apply to multiple mission needs and applications, the better. 

And yeah sure fair on PYPL. I am bullish on the digital payments sector broadly. That’s a semantics thing

There are about 253 trading days a year. 
7.5 hours during regular trading hours. 
At the rate of return that you had this year, ~1.713 M, your hourly rate comes to about $900. Thats the equivalent of $2700 to write this up. Or 3 hours you could have spent on DD for your next stock play. You are definitely underpaid over here ;)

The vw squeeze was like a 10,000% squeeze. It was on the rise for a long time before that happened. So you might be right, I'm sure it'll take a while before any big squeeze happens. But I believe in the general sentiment that there can be a 20% rise over the next week or two as some of the short positions cover.
Thank you for a well constructed answer.

Hello sir Jack a Lot,

Do you usually scan for unusually high volume and then research and do DD on the best pick out the bunch to invest in?

How do you usually find your stocks to invest in?
Gonna disagree with you here and just flat-out say snow is a drag always.
Well, you could start from checking my comment from this post https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kka1qm/if_you_had_roughly_10000_to_yolo_on_what_would
no, it's DCA. not timing anything
For every person that turns $10k to $1.5m there are 10,000 (or more) on here that turn $10k to $0.
I just threw my last $8k into RH, bought calls in a steel company that some guy on here wrote some dd about. Didn’t read it but it got a lot of awards, so I figured it was a good play.
Just hit for 38k wtf

To everyone shitting on nuclear, o&g and coal. Where do you think 99% of the energy is coming from right now? I've been hearing about renewables since the Paris Accords and this entire city still gets 100% of its electricity from a nuclear power reactor and all the cars run on gasoline. Yeah, I'm willing to invest in green energy, but for now the cash flow comes from conventional sources and that's the bulk of my energy play. Renewable energy is a pipe dream.

This made me open my fidelity app and actually look at the gme chart. That’s as far as I’ll go for now.

ok serious question. So I just learned  you can avoid PDT ban and lock in gains by selling the call one strike above the call you bought. but what if I want to lock in a loss if the stock goes against me? Would I still sell the call above or would I sell the call below the call I bought?

In West Philadelphia, born and raised, playin' seasonal labor and low income worker is how I spent most of my working days. Touched a fucking power line and went hungry because worksafebc is anti-social. I said no to drugs and smoked a lot of weed. It was two years of pain from 2016 to 2018, and then I happened to see Becoming Warren Buffett on Netflix. Spent two years since then reading, switched to cannabis oil, still trying to walk off the brain damage. I spent a weekend in the psych ward eleven months ago between calling for a market crash. They let me go. The market crashed (NOW WHO's CRAZY). I started buying in April and am doing well. Not messing with margin, not playing options. I'm expecting a post-financial stress test gold rush and am preparing for that. I'm buying shit you can't even post on WSB. I was up 500% two weeks ago. Had I not hesitated until November to buy what I was watching since April then I'd be up over 1000%. Everyone is a genius in a ventilator economy. Except everybody is insane. What do you do when everybody is incompetent? You go where incompetence is measurable. I come for the lemmings. I stay for the spectrum. Wallstreetbets. Some of us are actually on disability, but fuck that. I'm starting a business on value principles to produce cash flow and invest for our workers so they don't have to suffer when they touch a power line. Merry Christmas. Mushrooms are coming.

Buy some cute outfits and start your only fans site.
1) Why didn’t anyone take Twitch or YouTube public?

2) Why does a company need to go public? 

3) Is there a large enough TAM to benefit from answer to (2) 

4) How will this be publicly received? 

5) Why wouldn’t they go public without being “taken public” instead? 

The answers to those are a handful of potential reasons why. 

Now because this is r/wsb the simpler answer is: 

Not : EV / $SEARS / High Tech == no rockets.
Buy stuff and then sell it at a higher price.  It’s pretty simple.

Me and you both brother. But I learned a lesson, never experienced a crash before so I didn't know what to do with the cash I had. I should've had a plan always ready but I didn't and just watched the market do its thing. Thankfully I held most of my positions through the crash and didn't lose a whole lot there. But at this point I don't feel comfortable deploying my bazooka of cash in this market, or in other words, I have a hard time finding a company that is reasonably valued with lots of growth. (not trying to time the market)

You take a company public if you need cash to fuel further growth. You don’t take a company public so other people can make money off your idea.

The owners of OnlyFans are collecting cash. Every quarter, after expenses, they get the money.

Imagine being an early investor in State Farm. You would be worth billions in cold hard cash distributions.

Owners of private companies can expense things as well to their business with significantly less scrutiny.

Gotcha! You can sell your warrants when ever you want right?
Buy way otm with 6 months out or more. The premium has a leveraged gain and then just sell it to someone else 30 days later. If you're trading premium it really doesn't matter where the stock price is relative to strike. Theta will be next to zero and iv is lower with really long options.

Wow that's actually what I do as well. Roughly 50% in index fund ETFs. Well, of the remaining 50% I still have some 30-35% sitting around in cash waiting for an opportunity. I also have a small amount in RH which is truly yolo fund. I don't like to trade generally, so I'm looking for a better long term picks (also to save on taxes).

I watched some of the videos. Pretty insightful. It actually makes me feel better that these gains are based off of a lot of thought and planning versus just dumb luck and gambling.
I know many states including mine (Oregon) passed a law to that prevents us from opening another nuclear plan without a state wide ballot measure, also no nuclear permits will be issued until the federal government sets up a depository for spent nuclear waste (something that they said they have been doing since the 80's yet haven't) Washington and California also have a similar laws on the books. Nuclear isn't coming to the west coast for a while. First you have to convince uncle Sam to give a shit then you have to win the hearts and minds of the voters. In Oregon we run on wind, solar, but most hydro. Coal and gas are dead. Nuclear is scary. If you want an energy play buy fuelcell, SolarWinds or sunrun.

I have zero positions rn tbh haven’t had much time to trade and mainly just scalp day trade. Waiting to new year to see market shift direction and ride the next wave. Not playing in limbo I don’t have the cushion to do so sadly just watching SPACs and the market for opportunity.
That’s a tough call, as the warrants become more expensive, their returns relative to commons decrease. THCB also doesn’t have a DA yet which makes warrants more risky.

264%?  What in the world makes you think that'll happen?
If I were to start 3D printing these, would anyone here buy them?


I need to fund the yolo calls somehow....
Well, you invest on it because it will become a meme stock and meme stocks only go up. 

Also, the company's assets and market caps indicate that it could be undervalued. Company can meet its debt obligation. You don't even need to create a model. The company's current value should be between $20.00 to $37. However, that's not taking into account future income of the company so it could go way higher than that. 

Furthermore, it's a meme stock.
All these trades used to be managed by Merrill lynch.  Today I transferred all the positions to my Merrill edge account so I can make the trades myself.  I have 500 shares of GME in my Charles Schwab account.

Apple is taking a big step in one direction which is more privacy by default. That direction can make facebook useless quickly. Even if Facebook doesn’t use this data well today* that will hurt them long term. Also, your article says that technically their system doesn’t work, but their customer base apparently doesn’t really know that. However everybody will know that Facebook will be less accurate because of the iPhones settings, and that will hurt their revenues.
He could buy a $1M beach house in an OK town, put the rest of the $4.3M into dividend stocks and retire now and live a decent life. alternatively he could buy a nice house in a suburb and a tesla somewhere for like $600K and the not have super huge property taxes. also, why assume he would buy outright anyway? he could easily get a mortgage and pay for a lot of it with his dividend profits

I agree with this statement. I also have a lot of other direct exposure in EV/tech which takes ARKK out of the running for me. The stuff in ARKG is all over my head to research. I trust Cathy to do me good. ~7% of my overall portfolio for exposure to the sector.

Good question.  I’m new to Merrill lynch.  All my experience is Charles Schwab
Jason Zweig's commentary is the only part of the book that's understandable. Interesting, he's had a few recent entertaining articles in the WSJ about yoloing using Robinhood. Sounds like he felt that hoodies rush.
Dude that was lame as fuck
Honestly, if it was me, I would play it smart. Wait a bit after market open on Monday and get a feel for what's going on. We are still being manipulated by MC and BOA so they might dump again. We don't know but I would initially set a limit order at a price you are comfortable with and just keep an eye on whatever GME is doing. Give it at least an hour though because its pretty volatile in the morning.
All in thcb now

ARKG annual growth in 2021: 264%. Robinhood margin annual interest rate: 2.5%. If you’re not balls deep in ARKG on margin, what the fuck are you even doing here? This is not financial advice.

Anyway, he got himself a pretty neat lawyer, so there's a few grand of insurance money coming our way.

I've recently switched to a cheaper broker and been trading with 20 dollar size, consistently losing 50 bux a week, waiting for the account buff.

So many of the popular tiktok/of thots are so extremely average. Madison Beer is about the only one I get
Any thoughts on the possibility of crispr or similar science being used to treat aging? I am interested in this space but it is still really young. I actually just saw a documentary which had some good points:

- The life expectancy of a 70 y/o today is only 7 years better now than it was 180 years ago.
- Aging is the primary cause of the most deadly and expensive diseases (chronic diseases)
- 86% of healthcare spending goes towards treating chronic diseases.  
- Curing all cancers would likely only increase average life expectancy by 4 years because people will just die of something else. 
- FDA doesn’t recognize aging as treatable 

The open question is can old age be treated/prevented/cured? 

Some of the science around metformin and IGF-1 seems promising but I don’t see anything serious materializing any time soon.

You convinced me, just bought F $15c 12/31 after reading this.
While there’s certainly lots of merit to the post and what OP have done, I personally think trading strategies are different dependent on what you feel comfortable doing. This might be a good way for the OP, doesn’t mean everyone can find success doing it. I do respect OP sharing it for others to reference and think on if this might work for them, but this shouldn’t be followed simply because it worked for him. Diversification is definitely necessary to avoid that potential rug pull. He can be doing 3-4 stocks consistently right this year, but that one mess up/ unlucky play might get him back to the beginning. (Not to mention other factors people mentioned like this year’s market being hyper bullish and above normal inflations due to stimmys etc.)

Though definitely shares are way safer than options, so agree he can just diamond hand it through if rug pull happens on his shares. Yoloing on single ticker options on the other hand, especially FDs... well if you enjoy it then have fun lol

I want it all.  In April, I got the urge to start doing things with my money.  Lots of anxiety. I was in a good place because I was teaching at the college, but they didn't like me because I was a white guy.  Over the summer, I made good money teaching summer sessions, and in the later part of summer, had a great gig with the census where I pulled in about 17k in two months.  

I had about 50k in assets but was getting hungry.  I wish I knew how accessible options were.  Up to about 100k in assets, and am tits deep in BFT and GME with some longer option calls here and there.  

Found WSB when I looked up on the internet what the hell was that stock that the motley fool was recommending.  It was some shit.  Found r/stocks, then found /WSB.  

Now I have a sense of options, but also a sense of lament that I didn't buy  50 shares of apple with my 1k in college in 2004 and instead bought a shit stock called ONSE.  Apple was too speculative for me <Sigh>.
Easy fucking money bro good looks now I have some fun money for a call on Monday have a merry Christmas

My bank account never goes above 30k I invest everything after that number, and I never let my bank account go below 10k. I spend 10-20k every few months and increase my positions. 

I can currently make about 2100-2700 a week doing covered calls. I still work, because It’s more money why not and I’m only 28.

I spend about 5k a year on options, and take 6k out after I hit 12k. If I go below 2100$ on my 5k “option” investment I take it out and don’t touch for another  year. 
Never had money growing up, did not even graduate high school.

My goal is to make 500k-1 million a year doing covered calls/dividends/ options.

The Chewy guy is pressing GME to change business model to include more online presence. This includes buying what? 12% of the entire co.? (Currently).

Also, you say "everyone" knows it's a scam company, and yet they're still making money. They're THE brick n mortar video game store. I was against it and if Cohen can't get them to change their online shit, they're doomed, but I'm betting on the guy who made Chewy.com to do it again.

I think the key takeaway for the autists here is you can make a shitload of money with common shares, with a fuckton less risk. With options you have to be right on both direction *and* timing. Miss one of the two and you can kiss your capital goodbye. With shares, so long as you stay away from low volume, low float bullshit you can either wait it out indefinitely or control your loses linearly (there’s no exponential delta/gamma to worry about). I’ve [made over 100% ROI](https://i.imgur.com/WbeZZ5F.jpg) (which is Jack Squat compared to OP) in my retirement account since March, in essence using the same strategy as OP, except I’m more cautious and never have less than 20% cash available.

Awesome bro. I have shares of PLTR about 600 of them. I love confirmation bias haha. I hope your calls materialize. My cost is $26 so I would be happy with a $2400 gain. I am too chicken to buy options.

The tax policy would cause the market to sell off this month since it’s expected to be retroactive to jan 2021. If its implemented under biden anyone who sells then will be effected by it, only way to avoid is sell now. 

Also, i feel like red or blue ga result will be helpful. Dem victory -> more engagement with healthcare and progressive initiatives. Rep victory -> gridlock presumably leaves things mostly as is, positive for innovation still.

"But worries surround the Chinese lab, too. The SARS virus has escaped from high-level containment facilities in Beijing multiple times, notes Richard Ebright, a molecular biologist at Rutgers University in Piscataway, New Jersey. Tim Trevan, founder of CHROME Biosafety and Biosecurity Consulting in Damascus, Maryland, says that an open culture is important to keeping B*L-4 labs safe, and he questions how easy this will be in China, where society emphasizes hierarchy. “Diversity of viewpoint, flat structures where everyone feels free to speak up and openness of information are important,” he says."

ARKK had a great run aided by TSLA, but look at their other holdings more. If you took TSLA out, they’re still way ahead of competing ETF’s. They’ve also got some of the big growth ARKG funds like NVTA. 

ARKK is the best because it’s taking advantage of all their better plays. Safe? Maybe, but it’s also just better rounded so you will always gain during booms in certain sectors. ARKG was having a hard month when ARKF was doing great, for instance. ARKK still stayed course. 

That’s not to say all the biotech stocks aren’t great, but they’re pricing in that future growth right now. There’s no way to really know if they will continue to expand once vaccine news isn’t the biggest headline. You’re more likely to survive contraction investing in an ETF that touches the hot topic sectors but isn’t bound by them when they calm down. G and the others are more for investors wanting to diversify further in an ARK fund.

How much did you start with?
Been struggling to understand options when reading about it.  


So, price is $20. I'd keep $15 per share premium on the 35c assuming I execute before expiring? (taking a small loss if it never hits strike)  
Also keeping $5 per share on the 30c if I execute (regardless of strike zone)  


if the price exceeds $35, I'm printing both of those when I execute.  
(hoping I grasp above, but I'm thinking not)

>But, if it never hits $30, you still pocket the profits from selling the $35c. So, it limits your risk (and reward). 

How do you sell the $35 if it never goes to strike, after premium it's still a loss? Though premium covers the long (long being time) $30c?

>Basically, the ideal scenario is price hitting $34.99, so you pocket the $35c profit and get good returns from your $30c.

Don't I want the price to moon past both calls for profit?   
Are these calls different from each other?  
How is staying below $35 good for me?  
What time length is a typical long or short?  


Sorry for being slow, super appreciative of any advice.

I used to work for AAPL. They had an EPP which set me up on Etrade. I went to jail and lost my job. I scored a gig with TSLA in the Vegas solar division, but that operation did not last. I got some TSLA EPP in my Etrade as well. This started my habit. I rotate 20-25 positions and my take this year is YTD 50% all time 30% I had a bad rookie year.
Depends on deal sometimes there is an exchange not necessarily even or straight cash buy out which would give you money for your amc shares and ticker is delisted. All depends on terms but I know nothing at all. Pure speculation.

> Tesla has a competitive advantage in many things but a competitive advantage doesn’t warrant the valuations it has 

it's 2020, valuations are soo 2010s... that's why you have companies like QS who has to sell a battery at 40B MC...

But still crash won't happen until 2 years later. 2000 bubble was way worse. RN there's nothing else to invest in for the hedge funds and plus the boomers haven't gotten in yet. We'll likely see a huge blow off top before the final crash. Markets can and will stay irrational for a long period of time. RN, tesla is still beating expectations every time. if you think things are high rn, remember that it's not nearly close to the end yet. I wouldn't be surprised if TSLA's pe ratio gets to 10k by 2022 tbh.

Hahaha, the market is variable man, I apologize for coming at you, when someone replies to a month old post with something like that I assumed sarcasm. 

In regards to what you said; a nuke could hit NYC tomorrow. News, the market, it’s all unpredictable. However, when I posted this we had earnings, and the anti-monopoly news release that was to be decided a month from the post. The chance of more negative news was slim, and a 25% fall is INSANE. I bought calls 255 and sold at 275. It was based around the original anti-monopoly news, and even now this sell off is an overreaction. But then more news, and more problems come along. That’s why with options you take your profit and move on to something else. This is what I’m saying you don’t understand, because I closed that position a long time ago. I got a HUGE amount of responses from my saleforce post, and it’s the exact same scenario. I also explain in the post I don’t provide sell points because there will always be greedy people who hope for new highs. 

The question is always this: Will the stock price rise enough, and rapidly enough (represented by IV, the definition of derivatives) to overcome the negative coefficient theta, (speculative option value) within the given time period (purchase date to expiration time interval). That’s it, it’s that simple. Whether your want to hold and pray is up to you. But like I said, and as Alibaba shows, bad idea. 

Those that sold a week after my post made 200-300%, those that got greedy betting on new highs, and sitting on calls through something like the new anti-monopoly rules don’t know what they are doing, and don’t know how to trade options. Every trading day involves new risk, you should be treating contracts like playing hot potato with a piece of burning coal.
luckily you were in BABA, cuz that would be a true "fuck you trifecta"
Don’t do it. You’ll be disappointed. Feels like you’re wasting time. I built a machine then sold it a week later for more than I paid lol

I'm enjoying the book Lifecycle Investing. It sticks with Graham's "Buy index funds retard" philosophy, but then recommends using leverage to boost returns. Their backtesting shows using modest amounts of leverage greatly improves returns, even in the worst case scenarios. They have a whole chapter on buying calls as a way to get leverage at a reasonable cost. A 2 year SPY LEAP with strike at half the current spot price is like borrowing money at around a 4% interest rate. So you buy two LEAPs and are exposed to twice as many shares of SPY.

They called WSB dangerous and retarded, but it turns out buying options is the safe, reliable, prudent way to invest for retirement. In fact if you are not buying options or buying stock on margin, you are being financially irresponsible.

What drives me crazy is how the government never mentions the age group of the new cases. 

For example here in the UK they'll just say "600 more deaths today and 40k new cases". But what they don't tell you (by design) is that of the 600 that died, 598 of them were probably over the age of 75, and of the 40k new cases, 99% of those infected will survive. 

It's all fearmongering.
I think everyone is following the news wrong, the challenges posed by China is immaterial to how the company runs and be a dominant player. But the DIP.

Crash in March made me realize I need to finally get into options to climb out of that fucking hole. Also made 12k playing the wheel strategy on JNUG, super underrated strategy. Been able to make $500 a week consistently.

Started in 2012 with 25k I saved up, was a pretty good year, ended with about 45k. Been able to average about 12-15% returns per year, pretty fucking slow and I was playing value and dividend stocks mostly. This year finally broke 250k. Crash in March made me realize dividend and value stocks are fucking retarded.

I don't have one predicated on Cohen involvement, and I would have a tough time even guessing.  I'm a value investor primarily.  It would almost certainly be north of $30 though.  Maybe $50.  I'd have to reevaluate.  And I wouldn't be any good at estimates for something like that.

Certainly there will be a wholesale change in thinking about the company by Wall St.  So, probably upgrades and initiations galore.

Be upset that I lost 10k somehow
Yeah, I getcha. I’m not impatient, really, at least I learned not to be. I’m fine sitting on motionless or temprarily losing stock that I believe in or at least know about. I sat on Tesla and Apple and a whole slew of other bleeders through the September and November dumps, I sat through FCEL and NIO and GME selloffs, I have no problem with that. 

I am actually patient, but I came into posession of VALE almost by accident and now I wonder what to do with it. Still, solid advice sir, I really appreciate it.
Made me money thanks man!
Worse.. railroad companies and shit like that
Hell yeah merry Christmas bro
ARKK is great but most of their run was from TSLA. 

ARKG has several potential "TSLAs" ready to run.

> Self driving has competition 

bruh, name me the competitions... For Now, tesla is still quite ahead of everyone... Like even ahead of google.

Also, you don't really need to have 99% of the market to dominate lulz. Just having like 30% way more than enough.

I mean google also has "competition" in search, but still means nothing....

Amazon also has "competition"....

Microsoft has "competition"...

at this point you're just spitting out words without much meaning. 

Tesla is years ahead of its competition in terms of autonomous driving. Name me one competition who has a better AI in autonomous driving. No one even has close to enough data to compare... Data means everything in machine learning, especially in neural networks. imo it's too late for anyone else already.

[removed]
Are you talking about extrinsic vs. intrinsic value? 

The actual “intrinsic” value of the contract is simply the price difference between strike and the underlying’s current x 100. Example: you bought at $25c and price was $30 at expiry. If you exercised it, you would buy 100 shares at 25 and sell for 30 so profit is (30-25) x 100 = $500. Basically price differential times 100.

The rest is “extrinsic” based on IV and theta (I.e. that value comes from speculation). This is why ITM options don’t loss value like OTM contracts when price moves against you, and why they don’t gain like OTM contracts when price moves for you. If a contract is OTM ALL the value is speculative. That’s why your positions can literally go -99% 

I highly recommend making sure you know the difference

If you’re set on doing options, learn the Greeks. Really really learn them. Tastyworks has good introduction videos on options. Take everything you see on here with a grain of salt. Every once in a while you’ll get good DD.
-3k is perfect for the end of the year, since you can write that off (up to 3.5k).

So don't sell any gains this week, keep those unrealized gains into next year. If you keep those gains next year, great. If you happen to lose 25k next year, then youre still at net zero for next year and would owe nothing in 2022.
Feb 20 call is only a tad bit more expensive. Think that closer ITM strike is more valuable than 2 more months till exp?

People are thinking about investment angles constantly through the lens of current events. 

Just like when all the BLM unrest was going on across the country when the George Floyd news was fresh, there was a big run-up on glass and silica-related stocks.
Which indicator tells you what the actual value of a contract minus the premium you pay for IV and time?
GME is a once in a lifetime trade that can make you more tendies than you've ever imagined if you play it right. After GME you can pump whatever else retarded shit you want since you'll be rich anyways.

Shares (Lowest Risk)

April 2021 calls (Still low risk even deep OTM)

Jan 15 calls (High risk but huge potential since it's almost an FD at this point)
I wouldn’t say they should be at all time highs often- unless you mean in our current situation. Share prices should be based on expected gains (capital and income). COVID has basically decimated a year of profits so should have lowered share prices.

Ultra loose monetary policy forced people to reallocate their savings to the stock market. Some countries in Europe were charging savers interest. If it wasn’t for this, stocks wouldn’t be as popular- sure average long term return of 10%, but greater volatility compared to bonds.

great idea. would be great to hold through Lock up expiration and watch your tendies crumble into nothing

I think it’s a solid choice. Don’t let the IV scare you because earnings is gonna bump it again. Last ER I saw OTM calls with 430%

no, you cannot. but if you could.. you should just give your VISA card to a homeless person for the same result, just faster
Could have doubled in one day with the right call
Calling it lackluster was a mistake on my end. Design is great, engine choice is solid, etc but I don’t think it’s enough to propel Nissan into becoming a competitive brand again. Which was my main point. I was explaining that the brand itself is meh, and buying in just because of one potential release is not worth it for future growth.
I love that we got kids into this sub. It's going to ruin the sub and also their minds. It's a beautiful play. Then we run away to another place... Enjoy it
Also to add: the people who say trading is EXACTLY like gambling are the same retards on this subreddit who are “yoloing” their entire portfolios on retarded fucking stocks. You don’t do research or gather opinions when gambling at Vegas.

Fair point. Let’s see!
r/investing top comment in one of the post is suggesting the person buy a stock because it could be worth double in 5 years. If you got in on GME you coulda doubled it in 2 months. A lot of them over there are 20-24 and in the prime position to be yoloing. Its a lot harder to do when you have a family to think about.

Hmmm, you know i've noticed some AI scripts being tested on reddit ( GPT3) , and you would be hard pressed to spot the difference especially in short to medium sized comments. What's stopping someone from buying up thousands of real accounts ( possible on some websites) turning them into scripted  accounts and letting them loose on WSB , r/investing, Twitter, Facebook etc to manipulate stock indirectly by influencing sentiment 🤔.

I'm 90% sure this is already going on with all the #rypto's  in a very crude and obvious way. Thoughts?

Sir, if you train me to become your right hand man I will single-handedly blow Cohen so hard that he increases his stake to 120% + I will take a third mortgage on my house and kick my kids out of the house (and uni) to invest all my money in GME (and maybe a bit in PLTR) I’m waiting!!

I second ARKG, IMO any of the ARKs or at least an actively managed ETF would be good since you won’t be able to take advantage of sudden changes in the market yourself

Limited assets so no big numbers for me sadly. That being said, I've made 4x what I've lost, started in July. Best day I've had was 72% (GME $20c 4/15), worst outcome was expired worthless (helped out for taxes so no complaints tbh). Pretty happy so far.
I haven't gamed in 8-10 years. Part of me wants to get back into it by buying a gaming desktop and actually hit up steam and download some of the newest and popular releases. 

But another part of me knows that modern games are garbage and the true good shit is from 2004-2011.

It’s only been a year since I made my first trade. I fully understand your sentiment but I personally don’t trade options, I don’t think I know enough to get into that yet. Over the past month I’ve been on the SPAC game and it’s been doing me pretty damn well. My strategy has been to find the bubbles before they form and make a profit and exit as soon as I can.

I was only talking about IRAs, not 401ks
I was in a similar position last year. I took $100K out of a savings account in January 2019 and started investing in the market for the first time. I turned that $100K into $300K last year and this year I’ve turned that into $1.4 million. The good news is $150K is a very nice chunk of change to start with. If I would give you any advice it would be do your research, invest in good companies and don’t try to get rich overnight. Patience and compounding returns are your greatest gifts. Good luck.
Nice
My play is to see the movement on Monday. We’re gonna see big things after the merger is approved and the ticker changes. Company has good fundamentals too so wouldn’t be surprised if it hits 35-40 before the end of Jan.

Highly underrated comment here. I’ve been fascinated by Cohen ever since I started reading a ton about the guy (his media campaign worked on me...). Him losing his father a year ago at the young age of 69 (basically half a life from where Ryan was) has to impact how he’s approaching this. 

Speaking as someone who also lost someone close unexpectedly like this, I can tell you that those wounds do not go away and they can often drive you to be very impatient and driven (in a mostly good way, I’d say). I think Cohen is probably still dealing with this huge loss and maybe channeling some of this energy and pain and drive and maybe even anger (if he’s anything like me...) into this thing. And while my heart breaks for the man, I do think this makes it even less likely that he’s going to sit back and let George goddamn Sherman—a guy his Dad would have probably hated—run this show. This isn’t some dickhead rich kid with a wealthy family indulging his kids whims. They sound like some serious salt of the earth, hard ass working people that genuinely care about way more than the bottom line. The stuff he did to make Chewy what it is is actually pretty amazing. Because he prioritized a personal connection with customers that so many other companies consider afterthoughts or not even worth the time or money. Look at how GameStop is run, how they treat their employees (especially during his pandemic), and how they have historically treated their customers too—totally the opposite of the ethos espoused by Cohen and his Dad. 

So I think his relationship with his Dad, and the values they clearly shared, are playing a huge part here and likely will for the rest of this man’s life. A loss like that never truly goes away, and within a year of it now, it’s probably still raw as hell for him. But my man sure seems to have some CONVICTION here and I’ll tell you what: I now do too.
That’s the beauty about options , share price can rise but all it takes is a dip to destroy premium

Been trading for 6 years. Working day job the whole time so it's been difficult to trade. My lowest was down -$160K (learned options and earning IV crush the hard way). This year changed everything. Work from home, I got to yolo harder on calls and able to monitor them better. I was net negative from 2014 to Oct of this year. Now I'm doing pretty good and up 150% for the year. But greed and FOMO still hits hard. Might just dump everything before year close and take a break doing CSP's.

I fractured my ankle and fibula when I fell on my ankle wrong. The main issue is that my fibula fracture happened mostly horizontally along the bone so it covered 40 percent of my fibula. It needed a LOT of hardware to put back together. There was a bone that split from my fibula into the joint that connects my fibula and tibia. My body thought it was fractured bone and tried to heal it, developing pseudarthrosis. That bone fragment connected my tibia and fibula locking all free motion in my ankle. Fast forward 2 years, have surgery to remove bone, and clean my ankle joint. Ankle goes good. Unfortunately the bad bone grew back and is fucking up nearby muscle connections. Thankfully all I know is that its not cancer. Feels like a screw drive is stuck in my leg tho. I have another surgery soon that should help me out more.

I'll see what I can do.
They are the global charging network, first to market advantage full EV in USA Europe and China, high technology (other carmakers, except maybe Xpeng aren’t even close), in house autonomous driving, solar energy, long range and relatively cheap EVs, extremely bright future, and cuz Elon Musk + a little bit of irrational exuberance. And... they are the only EV company in the world that is profitable off pure EVs

The green future is inevitable and they are the dominant company leading it. Otherwise Earth will die. China and Europe are passing laws to force the switch to EVs over the next decade. I’m sure the US will follow suit eventually. Once autonomous driving is perfected, this market will be ridiculously huge - everyone needs transportation and ppl pay for comfort/ to save time or effort, reduce accidents. Also think about all the companies that will emerge as a result of it, wifi in your car, safety and comfort stuff, apps, literally imagination is the limit. This is what happened with the smartphone in 2007 where Nokia/Motorola weren’t scared at all of apples fancy new phone and here we are 13 years later. Sooner or later Tesla will start making deals w companies and partnering w them... etc

______

I’ll also add why China’s EVs will be successful. It follows history.

Ex1) Japan - Switched from agrarian to manufacturing and then after 1964 Tokyo Summer olympics to technology (Sony, Panasonic become dominant) and then came the success of Car giants Honda and Toyota

Ex2) South Korea - Switched from agrarian to manufacturing and then after 1988 Seoul Summer Olympics to technology (Samsung, LG become dominant) and then came the success of Car giants Hyundai and Kia

And here we are now w/ China

Ex3) China - Switched from agrarian to manufacturing (behemoths) and then after 2008 Beijing Summer Olympics to technology (Alibaba, Tencent, Baidu become dominant) and now we have NIO, Xpeng, Li, BYD 

This is just my theory tho lol kinda convoluted but yeah

What I remember :                                                      
 - there are super bullish markets where everyone is making money with meme stocks and it feels like nothing can do down, and there are bearish markets where everyone is super depressed. Both eventually end and sometimes people get wiped because of that                                      
 - pick good stocks that basically you can buy and never check their value again for 10 years and still sleep like a baby (ideally, stocks that go for less than the value of the assets)                                            
 - dont get cocky and try to time the market, but you should buy stocks that are cheap at the moment                               
 - any move that is not 100% thought through is speculation. You should only speculate a tiny portion of your portfolio and separate that from your investments                                                       
 - do between 25% stocks / 75% bonds and 25% bonds / 75% stocks

You can watch NFL on twitch now wtf. Amazon calls ?
Yeah - I think I like the idea of buying leaps, which that other guy suggested. I can even sell some poor man CC’s to offset the cost basis.
Yep. I think if you've paid all of what you paid last year in taxes for estimated taxes you won't get fined even if you earned more this year. Or if you've paid within 1k of what you owe for the year they won't fine you. It all depends on your specific situation and your income after deductions, but there's a good chance that if you've had significant gains the IRS is expecting those estimated payments.

I’m lucky that my dad is a stock broker. When I was 18 in 2011 he opened a taxable brokerage account for me. Started small- few hundred here and there from my lifeguard summer wages, but grew it to 50k by February of this year right before Covid hit, which it subsequently crashed to about 30k.  That’s about when I started taking a personal interest in stocks so I took it over. Dumped about 40k in it over this entire year with 65% YTD returns and now I’m sitting at about 125k

In now with money I need to cover 6 months of GST, need this money, and I sleep like a baby, limit sell order set at $100 (which I might stagger higher), giving zero fucks because buying in at $15.50 after the Cohen SEC filing was seriously good value.

There's just no way people are going to hold GME if it moons to $40 or even $50.
Why shouldn't I take 50% return on shares ??? So I can be left bag holding ???
good theory

he's right though, if the social media companies want immunity against whatever content is posted, they need to stop censoring it... only illegal stuff should be removed and they shoudn't editorialize either
Add SRAC
Damn GME sounding like it has more room to run than PLTR?

Wtf did u buy
What a g
Not really, it's tied up in long shot calls.
so i made an option call  1/08  strike price 28 on e*trade and i’m wondering that means before my expiration date i can buy or sell 100 shares at 28 bucks if it’s under 28 then i’m out of the money meaning my contract is worthless losing the 250 bucks for the contract is this all correct ? also  there is an option that says reroll  does that mean i would have to sell my current contract which means i would be down 250 and starting a new contract? . let me know if this is all correct because i fully believe in this company i have 30 shares plus this option call and i’m debating weather or not i should sell my shares and put them in option calls? i have done my DDs with option trading it’s just actually making trades i feel like i should hold on to my shares and let this option ride. ( i am also pretty new to the market about 6 months and i have been up 50% straight up trading with no options) this is my first one so wish me luck bois
🚀🚀🚀
What a fucking god...
$spce fml and I didn’t learn from $pton
Brutal.  Gg.  Dalvin was awesome this year tho
Heck, even TSLA in November. I bought a TSLA call and sold for 100% gain. Now that option is sitting at 650% gain...
Keep upvoting guys stay strong against the 🌈🩸🐻 carti fanboys
You're better off expecting nothing out of Ford and being pleasantly surprised, which means options wouldn't be worth it.

They've been in something like a seven year downtrend after their recovery post-Great Recession and only rode the market pump up a little bit this year.

Sounds like a plan. What that other dude said about VALE leaps might not be a bad idea. Jan 22 calls go for a low as $75, low IV, plenty of theta and if the stock gets to $20 by June, you’ll probably triple your money.

No one said it’s not going to eventually go all digital but all digital is not going to happen anytime soon. There is way too much value in physical games. 

Esports is bigger than every other sport in America besides football rn. That’s an untapped market that can be expanded exponentially by GameStop. GameStop has always catered to console gamers which is who I am and who I’m talking about . Esports is arguably the biggest cult outside of the nfl and religion. Imagine GameStop introducing late night lounges with beer food etc.. I could be over reaching but GameStop has never been that much of a social environment. In fact the only social part was hopping on the consoles in the store and playing another random kid on a demo while I waited for mom to finish up at Nordstrom. That’s what made GameStop such a fun place to be around. Now imagine them bringing that back and making it more sociable, hosting tournaments etc...

Skyrocket. They think the founders will sell all of their shares in the company that is used for corona and found osama all of a sudden... and Peter thiel will drop his whole investment after he just bought even more /s
So the way to jack the balls is going gme Short and than wanking pltr with the profit of gme longwise.

My trading app has no Option for options on gme. So going Stocks will be stonks in awhile. Sorry all the blood is in my shivering balls. 

Im awhile in etfs but wsb is probably my way for 2021

I would borrow shares and sell them.

Also, buy puts.
volkswagon short squeeze took like almost a year to happen once the shorts started piling in to heavy and then didn't really kick off til porsche announce they had a massive stake in them. Buying weeklies calls on GME at all time highs and all time high implied volatility is not the way to build this short squeeze higher, buy april or longer calls or shares, then a big news announcement will hit and it's straight to tendie town, who knows when.
Agreed. I have made lot of money with PLTR but also missed quiete a few other opportunities as well. At the end of the day I'm extremely bullish on PLTR and know this will pay off BIG.

PLTR is about to take the fuck off in the next few months and I'm already buckled up for the ride. I first bought in at $9.80 and have been increasing my position this whole time.
I hope you autist took the Christmas tendies I have you on the Saints game.
This is a good perspective. Thank you oracle.
FWIW I think you’ll still end up being profitable.

Done this shit since 2014. Simple rules don’t buy anything that makes it to popular on WSB. Buy things investing tells you not that buy. If you are going to play options only do long dated ones. I don’t trade every day, have some fucking patience. A lot of you act and probably are limp wristed children. Grow the fuck up. Also call your grandparents and your parents. They will pass sooner than you think. Don’t be simps but also don’t be an asshole. Give to the less fortunate but have a spine.

Yeah, I agree. I don’t subscribe to the “squeeze makes GME go $420.69” fairytale, but I think it could definitely go to $50.
$7.8m?
F
Yeah.. I also learned the hard way (fortunately it wasn't expensive) that if you don't pay estimated taxes before you file your return that you get fined a certain percentage of what you owe.
They take that shit seriously in my state. May get away with 1 year/6 months suspended but some legit time is pretty much guaranteed
GME is more likely to go insane short term and make you a massive profit. PLTR is more likely to be worth 5x in 5 years. Pick your poison. For me it’s GME
Calls definitely don’t hurt it.... MMs buy a certain number of shares to hedge when you buy a call option. I believe it’s proportional to delta

I’ve got Kamara and his 5 TD’s on my fantasy team, with no game to play because I’m already out of the playoffs.  With this performance I’m probably going to finish the season with the highest points total in my league, but I’ll finish in 6th place overall.  It’s been that kinda year.
I remember that outage.

I had just sold a put spread on SPY and the market tanked. I was traveling, and had already accepted that I was gonna hit max loss and wasn't even motivated to try to close the spread for less than that. Felt whatever about it and it was like $400 so no big deal.

Now that I know they're giving refunds I kinda wanna email them and pretend that their outage made me lose all my money and I was gonna use that to go back to school and now my future is hopeless.

Yes I watched the whole video.

PC games? You still trade those with your friends?
You are right it’s not apples to apples - but every other fruit has eventually gone digital. 

PC games - 100%
Music - 100%
Movies - 75%?
Console Games - 50%

But GameStop is more than just video games. Keyboards, accessories, mice, controllers etc...
It’s possible to do it. We’d have to compare to other specialty retailers.
 
Like I said, this is the long term perspective. Not gonna hold this for 10 years but the reason this is hot now is because short sellers jumped the gun. I rode this from 16$ through 13$ back to 20$ and I sold to invest in SPACs. I am still interested though .

I can’t think of any other successful billion dollar valuation lounge style
commercial community / cultural centres. 

Maybe:
-Boardgame Bars/Cafes?
-Shooting Ranges?
-Paintball 
-nespresso stores
-hobby shops?

However any of these that succeed have crazy margins (thinking of nespresso). Gaming doesn’t have that room. Best Buy fought off Amazon, GameStop could too

Dude, you left out a very important point. If you ever watched Jim during premarket, whenever banks are brought up he will tell you his favorite bank among all of them. Wells Fucken Fargo. If you ask him his favorite tech company, Apple. 

What do these have in common? Ryan Cohen bought these two out of all the companies in the entire stock market. You need to let Jim know man in that post of yours. They literally have so much in common.

Basically I’m fucking retarded Ahahaha
Wtf just break up with her if u want out
What if GME is always watching you, waiting for a good entry point
I agree the stocks miss out on some of the extreme gains he could have had along the way.  A lot of people come here and see these crazy gains but I’d bet most lose more or all of their money with options. 
  
Why do you not trade options?
Yep, not an easy process. Months of hell followed by months  of recovery but you eventually do get over it. Just have to put your blinders on and put in work for yourself
Arkg
I started with $5k in March but honestly don’t know how much I’ve put in since then. I reckon probably $40k of my own money in total. I’m now up $44k YTD of realized profits. It would literally be double that if I knew what the hell I was doing. Nonetheless, What a journey it’s been and I’m thankful.
It’s a mirror image, not sure if that was obvious or not....
Happy holidays mates. Remember to give the wifey or the hubby a good stiffy tonight.

Bears are just retarded honestly. Less than 10% of them come and eat at the right times and the bears who are actually good at this never talk they move in silence and violence lol. The annoying ones you hear all day in here are the 90% who lose money like the ones who are going to get assraped for the next few months as the new bull run starts up through Q1
95%

Quick counterargument here cuz I’m
With family but:

Yes, 3D printing is primarily good for rapid prototyping. That is why I am bullish on it lol. There is tremendous value add for 3D printing applications that can fabricate complex prototypes at a fraction of the speed and cost of a human fabricator. Idk what you’re saying about metals, but that’s not what I was banking on anyways. Even products that go into final production using metal can be prototyped with high strength polycarbonate. I can tell you for a fact that major aerospace OEMs are using this technology more and more right now. And I have heard adoption is increasing in the medical field (think prosthetics, or any one-off or personalized medical device) 

AI: “True” AI as you say it, (like a digital consciousness that can’t be distinguished from a human mind) is the holy grail of machine learning lol. Of course no one has it yet. Advanced algorithms as they current exist still outperform humans in many areas and will only get better. Machine learning will benefit from the trends of Big Data and cloud computing and move towards what I think you are picturing when you say “real AI.”
I have bought GME, thinking of adding 700 more shares to make it a nice round 1000.
Why do you think LAZR mooned?
More shares you have more money you make from the squeeze - and even if there’s no squeeze gme runs up to 30 or 40 easy
Ah yes, just in time for the holidays
Damn man good for you.
Very nice! no individual stocks vs. ETFs?? Love ARK tho

I dont have a position, but i see cohen as a culture guy. The main reason Chewy beat out amazon imo is because he knew how to market to dog lovers, and created an experience with chewy that is way better than amazon. 

On top of that Video games are really at peak popularity right now, there are streamers getting millions of views, many people are buying gaming pcs, ect. The industry is really not going anywhere. 

These two factors lead me to believe that cohen can turn gamestop into something that would foster an experience that would bring more people into the community. Gamestop is also a highly recognized brand for gamers. If they can capitalize on their branding and mix it with the level of community that chewy has they can easily claw their way back to being the a dominant player in the industry.

I have $19,000 loaded in PLTR $30 Jan 2022 calls (20 calls total) I bought yesterday, down $190

Also have $34,000 loaded into NIO $47 Jan 2022 calls (20 calls today) I bought yesterday, currently down $820. 

Hate bag holding, hoping that both of these have a big day in next couple weeks I can sell for a couple thousand profit. Thoughts?
Thanks!

At one time I was so addicted to looking at my portfolio that I couldn’t stop. Then suddenly it was also time to masturbate. So while it may have looked like I was masturbating to my portfolio, I was actually thinking about porn at the same time, to aid with the beat. I could easily have pulled up porn right next to the portfolio, but I didn’t want it breaking my concentration. That moment was the most focused I’ve ever been in my life.

Thanks for the information regarding pin losses, options are new for me too.

So let’s say I have a call option open for April and the stock is above the 25 price I bought the call for. 
Let’s say the stock keeps going up, would you wait until the day prior to the call expiring to exercise the options?
Good shit brother
My theory on Trump right now is that the only thing is he actually concerned with besides the election is repealing section 230.  Until he gets some assurance it will be taken care of, he will play 100% hardball as in not signing jack shit.  Especially after the senate turning their back on election fraud (in his eyes).  

Losing the election is one thing but losing access to his social media platforms with no recourse (i.e. suing) can't happen.  He will go full scorched earth until he gets this.  He knows if section 230 is still there he will get banned from everywhere and not have a single route to change it.
$ROPE is still going ? That's been a meme for like 8 months.

anything left in this CHYNA shit? got a co workers about to dump 50k into this shit because of this sub.. wtf people.
I agree with that amount.
My GF of 5 years broke up with me in March so she could “explore herself” aka fuck some loser 20 year old junkie kid on a whim. Was emasculating af at the time and extremely depressing but it motivated me to work on myself and learn more about trading. Figured out options and since then I’ve just about quadrupled my money to over $100k. I also just learned she’s now facing a felony schedule 1 narcotics charge that carries a sentence of 1-10 years in prison. 

Not that anyone gives a fuck but I see a lot of people say in here they got dumped and shit and hopefully it gives you a little perspective that you can come out of that shittiness better than ever before. And if you’re like me, it’s a blessing in disguise cutting the dead weight from holding you back.

Yeah, their earnings seem to be around Feb 18, and their growth this quarter has been fenomenal. If the stock actually starts slowing down, it may have a better chance of popping after earnings. Given the low IV, it can only go up, really.

Tip for you tards who are marked PDT. Buy your options right before market close so you can sell the next day on the early morning pump. EZ money.
Just put in an order for Robinhood for 4/2021 $55c on CSIQ because I won’t remember to do it Monday morning.
I bought it at 19 when it was basically assumed that the R senate was set in stone.....2 months later its at 27.  For an ETF you ain't getting better returns than that.  Its the real deal.

No money in those items.
I think the recovery plays are kinda weak just because you can make 20-40% or more on the right innovation plays (ev, battery, a.i, SaaS, cyber security) or even an ark fund but if your money was locked up in delta or a cruise line your portfolio would pretty much be trading sideways for a couple months before u see the same returns. Its not that recovery plays are bad its just that there are better plays to make rn imo that would net you more.
Stimulus talks going well........
Fuck I’m nervous bought 1/29 235

Yeah I fucked with you that time, but then you started  yeeting my inbox with replies. So I legit had you blocked for like a month. This is reddit btw, If someone is fucking with you all ya gotta do is block them. If you think this is the person who doxxed you, that’s not me and has no affiliation with this account. To further straighten things out this is not IAC and it is not Bitt. This is the dude you tried threatening with the SEC nonsense. I’m done my man. Just don’t fuck with the guys in the discord. I’m done with this nonsense, I respect you for bringing that discord together, there I’ve met some really great mother fuckers, if leaving that discord means you’ll stop fucking with the vibe then so be it my man.

you joshin me bro
Not sure if right now is the time to buy man... Check out L y n as... compare the supply chain fundamentals and contracts, then tell me if the valuation on MP makes sense or is going to get snapped back to reality. Check out molycorp and the refinement problems they had, then check out u u uu white mesa mill... then consider the texas startup that's coming soon and the quality of the ores. Then check out the ownership of mp and ask if they will continue to get govt favor...

Or just throw 100k at it, whatever.

Let's go

I understand the cost for the actual fund, but you’re missing the additional hidden fees. Your 401K plans goes from you, to your employer, to the fund (Vanguard), to the funds that pay the insurance companies, the insurance company endorses the fund through revenue sharing to your employer, and then back to you to pay for everything. Not to mention bookkeeping fees, etc. Look at the fine print in your contract, you’re not just paying for that Vanguard (great company) fund.
I'll risk a lifetime ban on that one. If PLTR hits $300 by then I'll buy someone a brand new car roughly $25k. Not sure how to make it a contest or how the logistics of that would work. But I'm 100% game on that one.

It’s boomer porn. Good for value investing, but the formula Graham lays out is outdated and should be modified if you’re going to use it. Doesn’t really apply to growth stocks.

Note: I recently wrote a script that runs 8,312 tickers through a modified Graham formula to identify undervalued stocks. It found some I hadn’t considered and identified even more I wouldn’t touch. It basically teaches you how to turn $10k into $11k in 5 years.

Did you even watch the video and how long do you plan on holding GameStop dumbass. Did you not watch the part about restructuring GameStop from just a store but into a esports entertainment/ game lounge and GameStop getting exclusive partnerships from sponsors. Turn into the espn of gaming. Also cd/ DVDs are a much different, it’s not apples to apples, any retard with a little bit of common sense knows that. 

Firstly CDs went out of business because of an unlimited number of reasons I’ll list just a few. 

-one it’s so easy to pirate that shit to any computer
-it’s so much more convenient than carrying a CD player everywhere.
-it’s way cheaper to just buy songs you like from iTunes, then buy the entire album.

As for DVDS/ blockbuster dying, streams make sense. Most people watch a movie or a show no more than once. And also it’s so easy to pirate that shit/ stream online.

Video games on the other hand are not as easy to pirate on the computer without get caught and pretty much impossible on consoles. Video games are getting more and more expensive, so it would be worth money in a pre owned market unlike cds and dvds. Lastly, many people like myself, still like sharing or trading games with friends through trading disk, so that you don’t have share ownership of your account every time you want to share a game. 

Video games are way more collaborative then those other mediums and obviously GameStop recognizes that and is doing something about which I believe will be successful.

NKLA is beyond ridiculous.... it is nothing more than window dressing for a fraud on investors. Trying to keep the stock up. What product would they even build in that factory, I am not even sure what they are saying. Look at how fast TSLA puts up Gigafactories...NKLA will end at zero, eventually, when who knows... they have no value. If someone is going to make a crazy bet on a company, they would be much better to pick any other stock popular on WSB. It is crazy how NKLA hasn't gone down to like 1 dollar.... maybe equal to their cash on hand, whatever that is. Maybe 2 dollars a share, but they are burning their cash on stuff that will not work out.

It's a SPAC just a little over $11 with no hype at all because the merger isn't confirmed yet. But, they are in talks with transfix, a tech tool for planning freight routes and such, and when a company talks to the press about being in talks with a merger, it usually means the announcement is soon. Once confirmed, I expect it to go way up.

Im 18 and afraid I might get a bit lost in all that wording.  To put it simply you owe taxes on any realized gains for that year. If you’re down you won’t pay anything (I don’t know if you need to report anything). If you realize gains in 2021 great. You owe taxes on those gains and any losses in 2022 won’t offset what you owe. However if you realize January 1st 2021 and lose it all then you’re not on the hook at all. So just wait, you’re not in a sketchy position at all though so do some more research but don’t sweat it.

Last disclosed position was 12,9% of the outstading shares. If he aquired more, I think he he has 10 day's to disclose them in a 13D.  So if he was responsible for the big move on tuesday (for an instant) he would have until next year to disclose it. .

I can be anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and that’s just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your miserable ass off the face of the continent, you little shit. If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little “clever” comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would have held your fucking tongue. But you couldn’t, you didn’t, and now you’re paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will shit fury all over you and you will drown in it. You’re fucking dead, kiddo.

It really should only be the amount you paid for a call option if you bought it (if you aren’t already on margin).

But... if you hold it too long or can’t exit before expiration but are in the money expiration day you can be auto exercised and then you can lose borrowing cost plus changes in the stock after buying 100 shares per option. As an option seller if you open a position to sell puts you can be assigned early before expiration date.

You can avoid this by calling broker and putting “do not exercise” order.

I only had to do that once for Google because I traded like an option with 3 days to expiry and it didn’t move and then last second all of a sudden it spiked $10 to be like 0.10 in the money so I’m like “uhh do not exercise” . Although I did get exercised on some Bank of America calls for a huge amount once rather than sell

Can you educate here? Why not borrow the shares at 20%? Is that daily? It seems better than the current short option. Also what was the total? I saw about 40 lines at 150 for 6m?

anyone not recommending PLTR for 2021 hates people and is simply just trying to hog all the shares for themselves.
no whoever that person is is a moron. Arkk has by far been my biggest holding since it was in the 80’s and i’ve never had more conviction in a position.
Same... 98%. To the KUIPER BELT WE GOOOO🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Noice!
I swing traded (aka paper handed) WSB stocks for the last few months and it was super interesting and rewarding, but also consumed way too much attention.
So after the GME spike this week I liquidated my shares and put 70% into ARKK LEAPS Jan2022 and intend to hold throughout 2021 to skip taxes for the year and focus on different things than stocks.

Other positions PLTR march calls and GME april calls
I never use any of those apps.

Come on!!!
/u/DeepFuckingValue first off I’d like to comment and say it’s been a pleasure following your posts the past few months and writing erotic comments on them here and there.  Reading back through your posts last year was truly incredible, especially after watching this trade play out in your favor and seeing your thesis proven correct.  I hope that you’ll continue to share your updates, and roll some of those expiring contracts into new contracts and grow that wealth even more! Who knows, could be lookin at 8-figures soon enough.

I get more and more hyped about GME every day.  I don’t know what the price target really is now, other than somewhere up.  It looks like it has good things coming in the future, that’s for sure.  

Being able to put a face to the name is awesome, and I had never heard of your YouTube channel before.  I just checked out a couple of the videos, and will watch a lot more of them in the coming days.  You’ve hit the jackpot, and your appreciation in the most recent video is very telling.  Enjoy the newfound success friend.

I’d just like to add that you’ve got the ultimate 💎🤚, one’s most of us couldn’t even fathom possessing, and quite possibly the biggest dick this subreddit has ever seen.

I’ve told my friends/family about this trade.  Shown them your updates.  You’re a living legend right now.  Hope you have a happy holiday and enjoy some much deserved time off.

You literally end up paying 100% more just to have it delivered. They bake in price increases to the menu and have all sorts of random fees, then they guilt you into putting a “tip” on top.

Where are you getting 0.1% in fees? It’s usually 2% which ends up costing you half your portfolio in 30 years.

Hey so why DOESNT this happen? Crazy year for Melvin. Take that number down. Cover hard and get as much out. Then hold the rest at penalty. $30/share won’t kill you. Double your loss. $60/share will kill you at quad your loss.
Then go get it yourself and enjoy the time out of the house. Chinese food on Christmas and delivery existed long before that garbage company DoorDash.

401k fees are like 0.1%, it's pretty negligible. I max mine out, max my IRA, then some for savings and some in taxable brokerages. Tax benefits make it worthwhile, and it's pretty idiot-proof (never blew up my 401k on 0dtes).
Many people have been asking my positions/what I am currently invested in. There’s a few others but the following screenshots are the bulk of them. Goodluck everyone!

Correct, also as others have noted those values are only form IBKR. So take them with a grain of salt, as they do not represent the whole picture.
Hahah that’s the perks of shares! Selling to us gamblers hahaha

But yeah you timed out leaps perfectly you son of a bitch! Especially on Tesla, damn!!
Started trading with $2K on Jan 2019. 

Started with swing trading stocks. 

Consistently deposited $2K monthly whilst slowly learning. 

April 2019, bought my first options (puts on NFLX and LYFT expired worthless, but I was learning).

Still mainly trading stocks, with small sizes on options on the side.

July 2019, bought my first TSLA call in anticipation of earnings. Got wrecked. 

Jan 2020, started mainly trading options instead of stocks. Big wins on tech earnings plays.

Feb 2020, hit the jackpot with TSLA calls. Account nearly doubled compared to deposits. No more deposits being made. 

March 2020, got obliterated. Account -70% compared to deposits. 

Took a break from trading for 6 months. 

Came back and started rebuilding. 

Made some huge 150% to 800% wins on FIZZ, UBER, UPWK calls. 

Currently, I'm almost back to break even compared to deposits.
Problem is you can’t get fractional options and they get pricey real quick with higher share prices. Can always do spreads but long calls get prohibitively expensive

All I remember is buy index funds because you’ll never beat the market
It's the easiest place you can look at, with out paying money. (And I'm not even sure were you would go for that)

Also I would be very surprised if the shorts cover their positions, w/o affecting the amount available at one of the biggest brokers in the world. So you are right it is an incompled picture, but the best we can easily access. (Also there were a couple of prize movements the last two weeks that corelated pretty well into what we could see on IBorrowDesks, so... idk)
That’s pretty good, this year I did 75k into about 1.1 million and counting. NIO day will make it 2 million

Fair point, and good on you for thinking big picture and not looking to find your last career first. I don’t see myself practising forever either—unless partnership becomes a real possibility.

I should clarify my original post though. I’ve seen the Phil/bus background giving a slight head start at the LSAT/law school level, but after that the playing field is even and nobody cares what your undergrad was in (except for certain niche areas like intellectual property). A JD and corporate/transactional experience will give you far more than just the ability to interpret contracts. Think connections, access to capital, insight into different industries, etc... it’s a great launchpad.

So you think that nobody would buy out the equity on a company that made 100 billion a month for a market cap of lets say 100 billion? They would make their money back in a month and could also take it private so that they wouldn't have to share the profits with any retards.

So, I've been looking at CLF, but I worry that the upside will be limited compared to VALE or MT because, basically, right now the demand is coming from China.

If USA reopens with a bang of infra building very soon, then CLF is well positioned to profit off that because of the tariff wall. If China chills out first though, then CLF is going to be competing with volume from VALE / MT / etc for the american market.

I don't think steel will cool off before summer though.

Something I've been looking into is scrap steel, right now I feel like a lot of the pricing is going into iron producers, but not yet fully priced into scrap, which also is very high.

Another thing I've been paying attention to is the shipping prices and investing in boats (check baltic index and related), which are totally not pricing in this yet.
Buying BABA at a 15% discount is the best Christmas gift ever 🎁🎄

Read OP's name. He's self-promoting his book
You'll feel happier if you have a 20% down. PMI is an issue - would you have to pay that? It's completely preventable real money with a very real time value. A bigger issue is that every realtor will manipulate you to try to buy the biggest house you can for your budg. Don't fall for it.

Yup, saw SBE was moving and BLNK had fallen well behind. Honestly that’s been one my best best strategies the last 3 months. Follow a handful of growth sector stocks, if one gets well ahead of the others and hold those gains, make 2 weeks calls on its competition............... if only I’d held that BLNK call thou. Dang. But my strategy has been to sell 20% of winners as they move. Lock in my initial investment, then stagger the rest

If you go to his GME posts he was shaming people who sold their calls on the 18th and him being a hypocrite sold his own shares. I can't believe people still buying into his pump and dumps.
You don't know all the internal politics and brinkmanship of the Chinese Government... what if they decide they don't like most of the shareholders of BABA and want to prop up something new for their core loyalists instead?  Why else would they be doing anti-trust?

There are several scenarios where BABA doesn't do well in 2021 and your display of smugness comes before a fall, imo.
Baba could be a long play but never play to much on China 
I really like AMD see it breaking $100 🔜 probably my favorite stock don’t know why just have a gut feeling and 120 shares of it
long $PLTR play - why?? - insulate from a crash... since $PLTR derives a considerable portion of revenue from never ending government contracts. would need to not just crash the government, but stop it from printing money.

we gonna have way bigger problems when that happens, so get them tendies.

oof
I know I’m gunna get a lot of hate for this but if you any of you guys don’t understand why baba will go back up this year then you should seriously consider ending your trading careers. This game requires you to be able to truly think, and understanding why baba cannot fail long term is one of the easiest analyses one can make for the market. If you can’t understand it then either get out or go all in on an index fund. Sorry but just being real with y’all

Your plan is literally pure gambling not trading or investing. The stakes are too high and if it goes wrong you are literally going to fuck up your life. It of course can work but you might as well be playing russian roulette because how stupid your idea is.
What does everyone think will happen with SPACS now that companies can direct list through the NYSE?

Merry Christmas retards.

so GME or PLTR optionsscheins??
I agree and if they played things smart and rationality they would start covering soon. Yet time and time again the shorts have doubled and tripled down, that's how they got into this mess in the first place. They aint acting rationally!

Damn, sorry dude.
M/V/I/S has the best tech in their space and are looking for a company to buy them out. They have a demo of their tech coming in April and there is a very high chance they announce who will be buying them in the spring. If you are looking for a longer term hold the stock could easily be in the 20s by then.
I’m getting back in now and my goal is to do some covered calls and possibly put credit spreads. There is more way than one to make money in the market. Good luck brother, merry Christmas!

When your world is falling apart you can treat your money like you have nothing to lose and become a king. Don't forget that. That immense amount of money you make because your wreckless will get you the nicest fucking cane around or if you invest in ARKG, a new leg may grow in it's place.
you are lucky you even have 1 leg
I just subscribed to your YouTube channel. You seem like a pretty knowledgeable person. Congratulations on the GME gains, it’s great to see you’re still holding. I sold my calls earlier, looking to see if I can get back in with more. If not, oh well, I’ve still got some shares.

If I pay part of my tuition with profit from GameStop, you’re definitely one of the reasons why.

I’m chuckling at all the platinum and gold awards you’ve given. Merry Christmas, and best wishes to you.

Premiums are a rip though.
Kinda too lazy.... but it’s true. Also, lately if you follow JD Founders weibo he talks about how Alibaba is cheating right now and it’s going to catch up to them cause they’ve been threatening local municipalities to waive their tax obligations.

I’m in the same boat.  There’s been a pretty consistent bump when market opens, I’m looking to sell on the rise up and roll out when it drops.  I started playing the volatility on weeklies   last week, sell on the upswings, and buy further out on the downswings.  I’d recommend doing the same Monday morning.

"Did you ever hear the tragedy of Bemjamin Graham the intelligent? I thought not. its not a story the WSB would tell you. It's an investing legend. Benjamin Graham was an Investor, so powerful and so wise he could use the Margin to influence the market to create money... He had such a knowledge of the fundamentals that he could even keep the ones he cared about from losing all their money. Actually doing research is a pathway to many abilities some consider to be unnatural. He became so rich, the only thing he was afraid of was losing his money, which eventually, of course, he did. Unfortunately, he taught his apprentice everything he knew, then his apprentice killed him in his sleep. It's ironic he could save others from bankruptcy, but not himself."

Because that is what Musk and Tesla do. They are just trying to mimic Tesla, partly in the hydrogen space, and always have been. What they rely on is investors who can't tell the difference between NKLA and TSLA. It is so beyond an obvious scam. Trevor Milton compared himself to Musk and constantly told people how smart he (Milton) was. Obviously there is new management now - but to give them any benefit of the doubt is crazy. Maybe they have skills Milton didn't have, but they teamed up with Milton because they wanted to ride the hype to stock gains. Now what is left is a company with a history of lies and a history of spending money on things to prop up their stock. It is beyond outrageous.... nothing will every come of this company... or at least no one should ever bet on this company.... they have no IP!

I think if the shorts were smart, they could bite the bullet and take the losses now for tax reasons before the start of 2021. However time and time again they just keep kicking it down the road and rumours are that Melvin Capital have a massive put call for sometime in January. I wouldn't hold your breath but it legitimately has a possibility of happening on Monday or Tuesday. Anyone thinking weeklies should be weary though.

TL;DR GME mooning sometime between now and March. Why not now?  🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
As of his last reporting, yes. But he's under 5% now so we'll only get updates quarterly. IIRC his thesis was simply to exhaust the buybacks, pay a special dividend, squeeze the stock and close up shop. Very different from the capital intensive "burn and grow" strategy of Ryan Cohen.

It's a total shit-heap. It exists to suck up government money and produce the bare minimum in exchange while leveraging its political contacts and geographically widespread factories/offices to make the government give them even more money as a sort of privately run jobs program.

They said the same with DEAC / DKNG and this is a much lower float. I am confident enough to hold through as my largest position is deep ITM and shares bought at 20.

True lol I just bought leaps during march’s crash in APHA, TSLA and OKE. Basically 1,000% my account rather than 200-300%.

Now I sell weeklies to plebs and use the premium to buy PLTR 😂

GME still on REG SHO list, Thursday was the 13th consecutive day.  Monday could be interesting.
Sad thing is, he's right. This has been the easiest and most profitable year to trade. Every dip was bought, and meme stocks that were pumped here pumped in the market too. I don't want to be a downer, but the end is probably nearer than everyone thinks. There's no reason to go short, but take profits early and often should be preached here more than diamond hands now.

If you touch the snowflakes on robinhood, you get a dollar back for one you touch.
i know. I just turned 18 so i’m broke but managed to get around 100 shares. i originally bought at 17 but when it dropped after earnings i bought 300 more at around 12.50. best decision of my life. GME to the moon!!
I would buy them if I had extra money, just down mid 5 figures this year so I won't be buying them.  I mean I would buy like 2% out of the money in this case, the ITM strike was just an example of how shitty weekly premium is.
I know some bitches with 20+ pairs

12% of GameStop’s revenues are from their resale business. According to Blockbusters 2011 annual filing, only 5.8% of their revenue was from sales of items. And this was usually from them selling the old DVDs no one wanted anymore. As far as I knew, they never took actual trade-ins either. Another difference is that many blockbusters were franchises. Final difference? Only half of GameStop’s revenue comes from new game sales. Yes this is a slightly outdated business model. But this is radically different than saying their whole business is outdated like blockbuster where 90% of their revenue was from an outdated model...

Be careful making this comparison. As it simply ignores the fact that GameStop is not analogous to blockbuster. If anything the best analogue for a business that was outdated and failed which is similar to GameStop, look at is circuit city not blockbuster.

Awesome man. It really is so fulfilling and will definitely consume a lot of free time. 

In general before choosing a project you want to have goals in mind. Do you want to focus on repairing and restoring a vehicle? Do you want track days? Do you want to turbo charge a car? Or maybe you just want a fun car to drive and tinker on. There is obviously a lot of overlap between these but it’s worthwhile to have a rough plan first. 

I’ll be honest a budget of $1000 isn’t much especially in today’s used car markets unless you want an absolute bottom of the barrel civic or something. However if you diligently search CL / FB marketplace and set price alerts, and be first to the buyer with cash in hand you can make miracles happen. 

My best project car recommendation would be this, in no particular order: 

Honda Civic hatch or coupe, preferably a 1990’s VTEC model because of the known fantastic motors and fun handling not to mention aftermarket support. Fun to drive and reliable, relatively easy to work on. Price on these depending on year and condition starts at below 1000 for utter beater trash and will go up from there. 

1990-2004 Mazda Miata. This encompasses the first two generations of miata. Unbeatable handling and fun for the price, without debate. Best manual trans ever made in a consumer vehicle. Also unbeatable reliability and aftermarket support. Be warned though the resale value of these is going up, but right now these are still my best recommendation for a starting project car. Beater examples from the $1000-$2750 range. I can go on and on about these because they’re my passion, if you want more, info let me know. 

An old mustang (fox body) are cool, reliable, relatively cheap and good platforms. 

5th generation corvettes (the current cheapest type of corvette) are much pricier than any of the other options I put here but they have a LEGENDARY motor and are awesome to drive. Again easy to work on and relatively cheap and reliable. 


*all in all* being a car hobbyist is a money pit and a time sink. But I think it is absolutely worth it. If you buy a 1k car you could easily put 3x more into it than it’s worth in a year if you wanted to, or just keep it alive with minimum maintenance and rip it around town for fun. All up to you.
decided to do my own dd and signed up for the trial. im not really impressed yet...

Thank you for taking the time to write about your journey this year. I appreciate you keeping things real and for pointing out what was considered good decision making, good risk assessment and management, and what was just considered a boost of luck. 

You had no obligation to explain any of this to anyone but yet you did. It is up to people in the audience to either get motivated, learn a thing or two, perhaps try a similar approach like yours, or just be entertained as it is indeed fun to read. Those who are trying to find faults and mishaps in your story are just, wasting their times and emotions. Thank you for the motivation and tips. Congratulations on your success and I hope you reach your goals and enjoy the path getting there.

Is there a reason they’ve decided to build a facility from the ground up vs someone like ELMS who retrofitted one of many existing empty auto plants? Seems like a giant waste of money right off the rip.
**That's an interesting question to pose** -- so, what if someone were to realize gains in the following fiscal year instead of december? Would that essentially avoid this entire fiasco, given the person's account value is essentially flat / lower on the year, but has a net unrealized profit?

**This applies to me, since I have a total of 20k invested.** I've been up and down ranging from 13k to 58k, but my last positions have gotten me to an account value of 17k. However, I have a total additional 25k of unrealized profits -- so, for the fiscal year, my net realized p/L is -3k. But, if I realized these gains in 2021, then would it avoid me having to pay taxes on my theoretically higher account calue?

My only regret on GameStop is not liquidating all my portfolio and going 100% on GME, as it dropped after last earnings I kept buying but at some point I was left on margin and wondering if I should liquidate the other positions.

I decided not to, that’s my regret
ur gettin a wedgie
high risk high reward. pick a business that is speculated to go out of business but in fact will probably survive.  I would buy leaps on AMC... if they can survive till the summer the stock will explode. diversification is key tho, so may wanna split between 2-3 bankruptcy speculated businesses with a strong upside.  also speculation about bidens relief package... what could be in it?

I didn't specify this but my 50% yolo is balanced by a 50% "safe" fund ETF where I rebalance to 50% once I make enough in my yolo fund, or at least that is the plan. If I hit the next 100k milestone I rebalance 50/50 and continue yoloing. That way I can lose it all and still be fine. I watch the market basically all day and would set a stop loss if I didn't feel totally comfortable. I make good money and only 30 with almost 200k in my 401k so it's a risk worth taking for me.
That’s what I was thinking. Getting old I guess
that’s the pussy way into options. join like me. o joined the options gang by losing $1000 in 1 day on $40 PLTR calls expiring the next week. got addicted and made it all back in a few weeks. this is the true wsb way

The real question is, Is that butt model a man or a woman?
Yeah I definitely feel what you’re saying. My opinion is that this is the year where people are finally realizing how urgent climate change is. Millennials and Zoomers are hardcore environmentalists and want to invest in companies that represent those goals; now with robinhood and commission-free trading we’ve seen a lot more access to investing. 

I’d say we had some brief periods before that where there was excitement which caused a few run-ups, but now you see worldwide that countries are committing to being carbon neutral and the US needs to invest heavily in these areas or get left behind. I also think Biden has hired a pretty environmentally progressive group so far and basically anything positive he says will cause clean energy to skyrocket. We’ll see though lol my guess is just as good as anybody else’s
Better be salted caramel for that cock
Started trading tesla in April of 2019. Went all in on stocks and marginned entire account. When tesla went down to 180 I got margin called and had to sell 3 stocks, I was uber driving 80 hour weeks to not get a large chunk of my account taken. Finally got a job in robotics, my career choice but the pay was shit and ubered on the on the weekend just to get a bed in a room with eight other people (bay area prices). I eventually got fired from the robotics job because of incompetence and just ubered 80 hours a week and decided to just sleep in my car instead of paying to share a room with 8 other people, mostly ghetto fuckers as well. I was pulling 3k a week as an Uber driver (80 hour weeks) and pocketing most of it as I was living in my car. I was working so hard because I wanted to save for a big surf trip. Anyway, by the time I left the us for my surf trip I had about 25k in tesla stock and cash and decided to risk it all on tesla options right before the 2020 q1 earnings review. I really didn't know how options worked and no one in my life had expierience playing the stock market but I had discovered this sub and decided to yolo my money. I did and tesla took off during earnings and I got an understanding of how options worked. Then corona hit but I was in el salvador surfing and I didn't really see the devastation and chaos that was going on in the usa and decided to roll my options into year long leaps during March of 2020 because I learned about capital gains tax if you held your options for at least a year. I decided to hold year long leaps because I had conviction that the market would realize that tesla would be the first to market with fsd and wanted to hit that period with as much leverage as possible, I had been dabbling with machine learning and ai in my robotics career and tesla was the clear answer to being first to market. Those year long leaps that I have been holding have gone from 20k to being worth 1.9 million usd today.

Prenuptial agreements can protect each party from being responsible for any debts that existed prior to the marriage. Not from debts taken on during...

And they cover money before during and after, as long as you came in with it. In some states I think they can cover money earned while together, but that is definitely not the intent of a prenup
Totally worth it
Incorrect, Toyota has the best chance against the big 3 (NIO, Xpeng, Tesla) but Toyota will not be able to make the shift until the end of the decade. People don’t realize how long it takes to convert to building EVs and their interests are still tied in with those who profit from ICE. Sorry but any company outside of the big 3 stand zero chance till the 2030s

I don't know either, but yeah, if you look at the 12/18 1d chart for ARKK and TSLA - focusing on the 3:30 dip and recovery- you see a crazy 1:1 recreation, but on Monday and Tuesday and Wednesday and Tesla dumped, nothing reflected on the other. 
This is all purely speculation, but it made me feel better enough to not sell my shares.
Small fish here. Started Aug 31 with 500 and added two subsequent deposits for a total of a grand. Current balance is 1925. Was at 2050 (my all time high) two days ago. I really don't do much DD honestly, your guys' rocket ships have given me 92.5% ROI in 3.5 months.

Oh they all will, Tesla started out to make EV the other companies hold patents on all the real EV technologies they’re just squeezing everything possible out of going green every step of the way, why go fully electric all at once when you can release “new” technology every year and sell more cars year in and year out

He's got Jan 15th 10c...  so obviously by that Option He got the right to buy shares for 10 Dollars each when exercising.

Shit happens man
Exactly. No matter what his current account value is he owes taxes on the 80k he realized the year before. If he just held his position and then it tanked in 2021 that’s fine because when he pulls out he will either have a loss or much smaller gain. So don’t realize gains at the end of the year only to yolo needed tax money in the new year.
I don't know why people are shitting on him for this.  Dude lost all of his money the same way a bunch of kids are about to, and is trying to give them a heads up.  Easy to get cocky and think you know shit in a bubble market, and even easier to lose it all.  For the record, I didn't know who he is, and don't follow him or anything, so I don't have any skin in the game.

every single car company will be a competitor against telsa in the near future. they only produce like 400k a year... the second other large manufacturers start to chip away at the market they are in trouble. they may produce more cars each year going forward as EV market grows but i bet they lose EV market share within 5-10 years. if not sooner

I'm not going to buy them, but honestly they are probably a good move.  I bought FB after it's over reaction 10% drop in July and it recovered all of that and more in 1.5 weeks.  That was also during all the soft bank stuff though.  If I was to buy I would buy a little out of the money though as I like risk.

Should be but if it's not fidelity I'd veify with your HR or a co worker who uses it. In my case I did a rebalance and moved everything into brokerage link which acted like a fund itself. Then after a day or so the funds were in my cash reserve fund, which is just like your base money market. From there you buy and sell. Once you buy into something you have to hold it for 2 whole business for the trade to settle then can sell whenever. No gains tax to worry about and you can buy immediately into the next play

Been trading for like 10 years now. My story this year has been exciting with one of my yolo accounts. Started with $385 in July, got it up to $15k by September. Took a major hit on September 2, and proceeded to chase my tail for the rest of the month. Pulled like $5k out. Started again on Monday with $150, up to $800 as of close yesterday.

Article gives brief overlay. I personally  have been looking into getting a steel building and roof done. 3 companies said they wont gaurentee price till we sign a deal and they place the order. I asked why with the first one thinking this is some sort of shame . Like how do you run a business and not know the price of materials. I was informed the mills and distributors are changing prices almost bi weekly as very few mills are producing due to restrictions or import tariffs. How much of that is true....seems legit as i have read and seen a few articles, and i am not the first on WSB to drop this.
I would downgrade this but fuck it you got some tendies off it. Now move your position to PLTR.
What do you guys like to spend tendies on? Gonna get some expensive anime figures with some of mine.

I don’t know man..I’ve worked for GameStop from 2010-2015 moved up to Store Manager. Kinda knew the company wasn’t sustainable so I left. We would work our employees to the ground with so many impossible tasks and goals which in the end would make our best employees quit. We would just hire some fresh meat, train them for a day, and release them to the hounds of Karen. When GME hit around $2.00 I thought they were done for. Let’s see if the CEO can do something.

It’s in their interest to retain alums and deepen their “cultural hold” on those people.

Interesting. So, what you're telling me is, that gains and losses intra year can be used to offset each other in the same year -- but when none is set aside to pay taxes for the following year, then they're taxed on their realized gross for..the end of that year, even though they might no longer have those gains? This is confusing.

Out of confusion, I just posted on r/tax, a lot of my thoughts. Because this is something that's been harping on me for a while, I'm confused on how people could possibly be taxed on gains they no longer have.

Allow me to make an example, and let me know if this is right. So, if someone were to turn 20k into 100k from January to December and realize those gains, then he would owe tax based on the 80k gross. But, after that, say he yolos everything one month later in the following January. Come tax season, can he no longer net his losses against his gains, even though his account is now in a net decrease, since he has to pay taxes on the previous year (which doesn't take into account his current year's losses)?

As long as you liquidate prior to expiration - only what your purchase price if you are buying. If you are selling the loss can be unlimited.

In rare cases if you carry a call into expiration you can lose thousands of dollars.

Example - you purchase a Dec 31 TSLA call with a $1000 strike price for .05 ($5).

Magically TSLA gets up to $1200 on Dec 30, but you don't sell.  On Dec 31 TSLA is down to $900 so you decide to let the option expire worthless.  The market closes and TSLA hits $1001 right at the close.  Your option automatically executes and Monday morning you have 100 shares of TSLA in your account that you were charged $1000/share for...but in pre-market trading TSLA drops back to $700.  Your broker closes out your TSLA position at $700 within 1 hour of the market opening because you don't have $100000 in your account. You just lost $30,000.

This is called PIN loss.

TLDR: always close out your options prior to expiration.

Yolo’d $10k in GME 12/31 $22c. Tax write off or bust. Holding to expiry because I think the shorts want the losses logged more than me

what is you guys opinion on the fact that BABA is in no way owning a ali baba stock? but just a cayman island shell version?

Daddy can I get that pair of red shorts?
My fucking dad's parents were doctors yet his aunt is a covid denier and anti mask smh
So to the bears in here who are still lying about NIO and Xpeng faking their numbers did you buy puts? Garuntee most of you didn’t because I believe very few people would be that stupid and you’re just basement dwelling white nationalists who do and believe whatever trump says and just want to vent your resentment towards China. And to the people who actually believe that instead of doing 5 minutes of actual research and did in fact by puts then may god have mercy on your soul ya sad sons of bitches because you’re in for a really bad time unless you exercise them immediately to mitigate loss.
Cool story bro!

I agree but I also see high volatility and a one year peak within the last few weeks. It’s recent volume has been about 5% of its average, and I think it’s due for more major correction before surging past 50.

Started with about ~4K in July. Was buying mostly shares, and made around $1000 just off of 5 zoom shares after they smashed earnings in August. Got cucked by the September correction (literally the day after I first started playing options.) got into nio at $18 but sold when it dipped to $16 and switched to puts 🤡at my lowest point I was down over 50%. Now I’m only down 25% , mostly holding leaps and selling vertical spreads.

Started loosing money on cryptocurrency train in the end of 2017. Lost like 2-3k €.

Since 2018-2019 i was casually investing 100-200 eur with minor loses or gains. Just recently, like 2 weeks ago, I discovered and took WSB seriously.

In the last 2 months I am at 500€+, but if I take a look at what I lost in 2017-2018 era, I would say I am still below zero.

I am slowly jumping into the stocks trading, carefully. I've learned my mistakes the hard way. :) So far so good.

Yes, I think the trade will play out.

We have someone in office who is trying his best to shut down the government, while the markets are in a huge bubble.  I'm amazed there hasn't been a huge dip yet.

I've basically been doing 80% calls / warrants and 20% various shorts (VXX calls are still a short) and then I just prune whatever goes up 20%-30% every day or two.

I've gone from $200k to $300k in around a month, it's nice.

The one time there was a bit of a dip, my hedges went way up but my warrants barely dropped, so I just sold the hedges and took profit there... then within a couple days warrants were up again, and I rebought hedges for cheaper..

Agreed.  Show me you beating the market by a wide margin for a decade plus then I might buy what you’re selling.

Actually my best friend did beat the market by a decent margin from 2010 to 2019 and even nearly doubled his account value from January to March 2020 and then **he is now at a multi year low** because he “fought the Fed” and kept trying to short the market.  I love the guy like a brother, have and will still take investing advice but I won’t follow him blindly either but it further reinforces to me if anyone is “sure they have it figured out” it helps to be skeptical.

They told  me there would be lambos.. the fuck I'm doing here with no IPO date
I'm not predicting anything, and it is still possible to make money off a volatile stock. Economics and business work very differently in China, as I'll point out they're still Communist and just 50 years ago they were just as secluded as North Korea.

The only "blue chip" companies are state owned ventures.

Most stocks are penny stocks.

Even their big institutional investors are as autistic as we are, which is why their stock markets are often called "just another casino."

Returns on an aggregate level are mediocre. Although it might be hard to notice as companies moon and crash all the time. Most of the market cap growth has been from small new IPOs rather than growth of stocks.

The markets themselves are so volatile that in the past few decades they crashed worse than the Covid crash, then went up again in a few years, while the economy at large hardly noticed.

Many government rules are only enforced if you're the competition. So while a state owned may create a near monopoly and get away with it, a private businessman like Jack Ma gets in trouble with regulators for doing the same thing.

And I don't think the name Alibaba is a coincidence. It comes from part of the Arabia Nights called Alibaba and the 40 Thieves (Alibaba being the mafia lord). As you might expect, the platform admin busts users for scams all the time as people sell broken or non-existent items.

So while Jack Ma and his team seem to be excellent businessmen, I knew this whole time that at some point the venture would go POOF. I don't care whether they recover or not.

I dont think there is any fundamental disagreement. It’s more a timing issue. Do physical games disappear in 5 years or 10 years? Who knows for sure but its gonna happen. Let me know the last time you bought a Music CD. Besides at 4$ this was a no brainer based on acknowledgement by the board that a turn around was needed and the strong balance sheet. I still think this can run due to short squeeze and fundamentals. 

Just remember the last time you bought a computer game or Music CD.

It's so much fucking easier to manage a $250k account versus a $25k account.

Like, right now I have $25k in puts on IWM.  So that's a nice hedge I think, around 10%.  It feels like a TON of money to have in puts even though it's only 10%.

But if I only had $25k total in my account there's no way I'd bother to hedge.  I'd feel like I need to double that amount ASAP and would play way riskier, which is a shitty idea and as soon as the market takes a turn you're fucked.

TL;DR - even if you have a smaller portfolio, $2k even, make sure to hedge 10% or 15%.  Don't let your biases rule you like I did.
Merry Christmas! Markets are closed
Most of my gains from Wed got clobbered in nearly all of my positions (a lot of SPACs), but I noticed many found support and stayed there despite the selloff. If you look at GME, it held above Tueday's jump both on Wed and Thur despite a lot of selling activity. In fact, Thur's low was 19.95 but touched 21.48 intraday. This suggests buyers in two earlier sessions did not sell much and the bears couldn't take it below Tue's close which is new short term support. I could see nice volume next week and then a possible dump right after the New Year (people holding gains now to then sell into the new tax year). I'm looking for the swing to 25 by next Thur and will probably sell into the new year then reassess.

Hard to be worse than NKLA.
They hedged somehow- look at the 1day chart on Tesla inclusion day- you can see literally almost a 1:1 re-creation of that dramatic dip & recovery - no lie almost 1:1.

Now look at the 1d chart for the following Monday and Tuesday, where Tesla was bleeding out pretty bad .  


I was debating cutting my shares in half until I saw that Monday/Tuesday charts, I'm not sure what they did but it seems like they readied themselves for Tesla to settle lower.

Hahaha, the personal shot at my economic literacy is cute (also, ironically, you spelled it wrong).

Anyway, as I’ve said in other posts, none of what I’m espousing would ever occur in our lifetimes or the lifetimes of our children, but it is an interesting thought experiment.

I have been a hyper-capitalist in my life and had the same kinds of reactions as you when it was challenged but I ultimately found it intellectually unsatisfying. 

It’s rewarding to challenge your personal beliefs and argue against yourself. I highly recommend it. Just marinate on contrary views as a serious things for a while, and not just internet fodder.

How does that work? That's my question; why do people have to pay taxes on gains they no longer have, even if they're only slightly up on the year (ex: being up 22k, like OP was, instead of 292k, like he was at his peak)? Isn't it just tax on the 22k instead of the 292k? Why did he have so much debt if those gains disappeared?
So what’s the story behind that dip right there at the end?
Maybe if my RH account was green:/ sorry man

yes it literally can’t go tits up. just here’s some advice 

a) don’t buy calls on it cus the IV is really fucking high right now.. just stick with shares and 

b) set a trailing stop loss so you can forget about it.

just my 2 cents hope we make tendies in 2021 brotha!

According to research done by people much more knowledagable than me or you it’s going to take the boomer car companies most of the decade to transform into being able to produce EVs the way Tesla and NiO do today. Their interests are still tied up in those who are profiting from ICE vehicles. It’s not a fast process, NIO and Xpeng will be giants already by the time they enter in. Chinese people also want Chinese products because they are just as nationalistic as the US is. To think they won’t become huge is just being closed minded just because “China is bad”

[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology\_(Aristotle)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meteorology_(Aristotle))

&#x200B;

Here is a link to exemplify what I mean about Aritotle's works.

&#x200B;

>"An Arabic compendium of *Meteorology*, called *al-'Athar al-\`Ulwiyyah* ([Arabic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arabic_language): الآثار العلوية‎) and produced c. 800 [CE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Era) by the Antiochene scholar [Yahya ibn al-Bitriq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahya_of_Antioch), was widely circulated among Muslim scholars over the following centuries."

We believe Aristotle wrote treatise called "Meteorology" around 300BCE. We believe we know what it says, only because 2000CE we are aware of a Latin version. We believe that Latin version was based on an Arabic version from 800 CE, that we don't have any extant copies. And the Arabic version was just supposed to be a short summary of the original, which was written 1100 years earlier.

&#x200B;

Like Jesus, the best we have is a copy of a copy of a copy that was written 1100 years after the fact and is internally inconsistent and scholars can't agree upon. History is fun.

Success has diminishing returns. What is $10 billion vs. $200 billion? There’s literally no difference. If you’re worth $10 billion you’ve achieved success. Period. You can go spend you billions or keep going for the love of the game, but it’s not like it’s inherently unfair to keep someone from $50 billion when they have $10
Billion.

There is something inherently unfair about someone being worth $200 billion when people can’t eat.
You son of a bitch, I’m in! I hear they also have a 2k mile range.
I suggest getting it because as I wrote in another comment, it looks good on a resume.  The classes are a waste of time because you’ll learn more on the job than you ever will in classes.

Certain themes are important, particularly the soft skills (like systems thinking) and supply chain management.

Whatever job you take will teach you far more than any class you take.  People who do it for a living versus people who’ve been in academia for 30 years

Currently a senior in high school. Started when I was 16 buying SPY etfs and bank CDs. Now I trade SPACs and I’ve turned my life savings of $8500 into $31000. Hasn’t been a smooth ride though, blew up my account holding HYLNW.
I love my wife, and I've got some close friends from way back. But, without a doubt, money has always been my best friend. It's no joke. My parents were idiots, my extended family is weird, and old friends have moved into into their own weirdness.

But my money. It's been supportive, entertaining; and frankly shaped me into I am who I am (pretty rad, not very mean, "independent") because of it.

Merry Xmas money. I hope to have a lot more fun times together 🎀

For posterity, here's OP's post:  

Wrote a algo bot based on OP’s concept in this post where he made 20k+ before getting banned by Robinhood.

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/j0giqu/robinhood_banned_me_for_making_too_much_money

Basically OP just used a click bot/ keystroke script on a android emulator with the Robinhood app to submit a buy order 1 cent above the bid, canceling 100ms later if not filled and repeat till filled, once filled immediately do the same on the ask to exit. Makes you best bid and ask always without updating the NBBO.

Made a bot to do exactly the same as OP in the other post, except instead of a click bot I used Robinhood’s internal API + python script. Making it faster and easier than OP’s to use. Also has code to limit it to 390 or less orders per day to keep it from triggering professional status with Robinhood.

https://imgur.com/a/uv6yNoL

Example: VXX call option, lets say the bid/ask is .16 X .21

The bot would flash a buy order at .17 every 100ms, once filled it flashes a sell order every 100ms at .20. You are providing a better price/ liquidity without the NBBO updating and paying zero commission for it.

I normally trade with Schwab, but opened an account with Robinhood just to run this bot. Used the profit from their free stock to test it out on VXX options.

Only thing you really have to lookout for is volume traded on the option. Wana go for options like VXX, GOOG, AMZN and others where the spread is wider and have volume, OP does the same with his bot.

Why this works:

A couple reasons why, first off because of zero commission, you keep all the money you make off the spread.

Second, this type of algorithmic trading is called market making or more generally providing liquidity. In principle, the apparently free money is compensation for helping the markets to be liquid. The more people do this, the tighter the spread will be and the greater liquidity will be available on each side.

https://imgur.com/a/S6O8h6d

tldr: Robbin the Hood, making money at Robinhood's expense with a bot and not getting banned.

Currently using it, will post future updates.

Lurked for a year. Started with RH in June. Options about a month later. Was down $2k (~$6k at the bottom). Up $9.6k since Oct 30th (when I changed my strategy). I can’t win with weeklies. Wait for a red day in the market. If there’s a stock I’m bullish on but it’s down >4% that day then I buy the longest dated calls I can afford. I have multiple contracts that are already ITM and they go until March/June.

I started trading after a windfall and went the boomer blue chip route. Maxed out IRA and put the rest into a bot-managed index fund portfolio with some cash on the side. This was early 2020.

After a while I wanted to buy the massive COVID dip and got back on Robinhood to buy the big names I liked. MSFR, TSLA, WMT, NTDOY, LUV, UAL, RCL, and the like. Once I discovered WSB though I started actually trading and trying to make some money. Bought my first option yesterday right before close. $MT 6/21 30c.
There shouldn't be a cap on success. Yes we can tax them higher. But completely restricting someone from earning more money is absolutely absurd.

The last drop was due to some tax issues with Mongolia, but it’s just 200m. 

The main issue was a possible rights offering being pushed by RIO, but this was successfully put down by trq management that proposed a metal stream as financing

The mine has 2 parts, an open pit (easy extraction) and block cave mining (hard but cheap to extract and very high volume) that’s not online yet.

2/3 of my position is at 8.5 and the rest 12.4.

I really believe in this project, I’m 15k shares in.

Don't really post here but you do realize a communist dictatorship which like every successful country are also capitalists has launched a pretty unsubtle campaign against multiple companies of Jack Ma because they think he's getting too big? It's completely within their power to send him to labor camp and dissolve all the businesses tomorrow which is kind of the problem with dictatorships.

Who knows how it will be resolved, maybe it's a slap on the cheek and business as usual tomorrow, or maybe these companies don't exist tomorrow or are run by someone else but that's kind of what the uncertainty is about.

There's plenty of upside investing in a continent money is under invested in and that will have the most rich people within 5 years. In China's case, there's also some potential pitfalls, especially if you're stuck in an merican type of thinking about things.

Not many CEOs are worth $10 billion. Even Tim Cook isn’t worth $10 billion.

Most people worth over $10 billion either received it via inheritance or are hedge fund guys, and hedge funds contribute nothing to the general welfare or economy.

And if Jeff Bezos had his net worth capped at $10 billion he could choose to retire but someone else would just be appointed CEO of Amazon. It’s not like Amazon or Tesla would cease to exist if the founders stepped away. Bill Gates stepped away from Microsoft and it has thrived.

We’d still get all the benefits but more people would get turns at the CEO plate and we could close the wealth gap, which would be a boon for the economy and stocks.

Puts on Abbott? Their corona quicktest was found to have a reliability of only 60% (instead of advertised 90%).
“The powers delegated by the proposed Constitution to the federal government are few and defined. Those which are to remain in the State governments are numerous and indefinite. The former will be exercised principally on external objects, as war, peace, negotiation, and foreign commerce; with which last the power of taxation will, for the most part, be connected.” Federalist 45

Taxes from the federal government were to only be used for the limited purposes of the federal government (war, peace, negotiations, and foreign commerce). Yes, Congress can levy taxes, but we’re well beyond a gross misinterpretation of what was meant to be.  Not a single founder would accept the state of our current government

Can also recommend learning basic metrics- SeekingAlpha has great summaries of the relevant stats and even tidies it up into grades. I mostly avoided growth/tech stocks on my first go-round over the summer, so learning to identify what makes them tick was key (i.e. what is good revenue growth, price to sales, IP/brand moat, etc.).

Go on twitter and follow PoundingDaTable, MrZachMorris, Ripster, Luosheng Peng, Cathie's Ark, Keubiko, Brolin Walters, TicTocTick, Puru Saxena, Masa Son Cap, Post_Market and start following the follows of the last three. Not necessarily for stock picks but to better understand the mindset of market participants (and sometimes for stock picks). Even watching Cramer is good, for occasional insights on what drives buying when (e.g. the segment he did on how late in the year he would tell his hedge fund analysts to find the "up stocks". This lead me to start to think what successful hedgies would consider "up stocks" or what they would want to load up on for 2021. It's been pretty fruitful). Listen to Pounding The Table podcast. Consider buying order flow apps yourself like FlowAlgo and BlackBoxStocks. CHeck out Barchart.com for historical and current option activity. Check out fintel for institutional ownership. Etc. Over time you get a routine and a feel for what info to look at when.

Also there's a lot of good strategies people are listing here, like the guy that all-ins his account on equity in high-conviction plays, all the work he does for that. A lot to learn still, there's more I could be doing to be a better trader. Same applies to all of us

Whatever you paid for the option — assuming stock price stayed the same the value of your option will decline due to theta (time decay) — theoretically your option will approach zero if you’re OTM by expiration. So for eg. You bought a OTM call for $1.00 for expiration next week. The stock declines/stays the same; your option will start to decline in value and will approach zero due to the time decay, by expiration. Your overall loss is what you paid for the call ($1.00 or $100)

If you can charge your vehicle for cheaper, get greater range on a “tank/charge”, and make your cars cheaper and sell them cheaper, and there’s the inclusion of tech (essentially your car becomes a smart car similar to a flip phone becoming a smartphone), how can the legacy automakers win?

Legacy automakers have been competitionless for a long time other than with each other but now superior companies w their technology are coming in ready to take over.

One great example is Porche’s Taycan which costs 150k and gets a whopping 205 miles on a charge. Who tf will buy that when you can buy a Tesla or NIO for 35-50k and get 320-550 miles per charge? Even Volkswagen’s best effort into the EV space, their ID.4 gets a whopping 250 miles max for 40-45k. 

At the moment, they’re outclassed. And while
They play catch up, the new EV companies are refining and improving.
Don't forget companies who treat their employees like crap and pay low wages without bonuses can run higher revenues.
Definitely--the GRE is a joke in comparison. People actually try to get schools to accept their GRE scores instead as a result

The same is true for Aristotle's works actually. The more you read, while keeping an eye to the actual evidence, the more you'll see that Aristotle's works are only guesses at what aristotle was supposed to have said once, at a meeting or at a college lecture.
That is superstitious nonsense. I've been forced to take bigger risks for absolutely no reward in the past. There is no magical risk/reward parity in the world.

I did what Adam Smith calls rent-seeking: Extracting money from transactions that must happen, while providing no value of my own.

I'm ethically okay with rent-seeking from bigger cunts, but lets not pretend its anything but a grifting competition. Our net contribution is nothing but to provide drag on otherwise more simple allocative arithmetic. 

An ideological capitalist is the biggest dupe there is: Not only do they believe in easily disproved superstitions (including those that would countermand the seminal thinkers of capitalism), but they also believe themselves to be hard-nosed and pragmatic while doing so.

Here's the article on the historicity of Jesus. On first reading, you'll notice it spends a lot of time referencing researchers who believe in some form of Jesus being a historical figure. Not ignoring the experts, but ignoring the argument from authority, I look further to what evidence is presented. I see nothing.

On any specific event from the bible or elsewhere, there is no consensus. But people agree he existed, despite not being able to point at even one real, true event in his life. 

If you consider the Bigfoot, you'll see a lot of similarities. Bigfoot experts all agree on the existence of bigfoot, but not on any facts about bigfoot.

I definitely don’t think it should apply to corporations. I don’t even think corporations should pay taxes. They are engines of growth and job creators and I don’t understand why we inhibit them at all. 

As to personals wealth, I don’t think it raises constitutional issues. The IRS knows how much we make and has a general sense of our net worth already. And states (and the federal government) have constitutional power to tax at their whim and ultimately the taking of money over a certain amount is just a tax so I think the authority is there.

Puts are a ripoff. Especially with the IV being so high there’s no way the stock is going to pull back enough to walk away with a profit before they expire. And then there’s the issue that it might just keep going up. Think of the Tesla short sellers that were saying it has to drop.  It did have ups and downs Tesla but short sellers gave back 20 BILLION this year.  Never bet against a meme stock.  But you said you’re only buying a single put so it might not blow up your account if you bought only one

I love seeing the boomer car companies trying to play catch up with the EV revolution. Can’t wait to see them and Apple brag about finally producing a single vehicle in like 2025 after spending years building the machines that build the machines, meanwhile Tesla NIO and Xpeng have already taken over the majority of the world market producing tens of millions of cars per year and NIO owning most of the worlds robotaxi industry.

Buying shares isn’t a bet. This place has been flooded with pussies
Hey Im feeling generous since its christmas. When the squeeze rips your face off I'll let you buy a couple of my shares at 69$ so you can cover your shorts.

I usually donate some money to the mentally challenged this time of year anyways so it's pretty much the same thing.
I’m so sorry for your loss.
Release the hounds on this heretic.
Yeah LEAPS are great for leveraging. They can fuck you bigly too tho. Almost bought BABA LEAPS in October. Obviously glad I didn’t lol
what is a "prop" trader lol
Holy shit.
What days are the market closed next week? I can’t take much more of these half weeks:( my tendies
TSLA leaps before and after the split
I’m not fading cousin sal tho.
You sell a put and have enough cash to buy the contract. So if you sold apple 130 put you would need $13,000 cash! Then you hope apple stays over 130 so you don’t get assigned. If apple goes to 125 you still have to buy it back at 130
Uh oh class! Retard alert!
I went and got my MBA 5 years ago and the only thing of value I learned was how options work, but I didn’t start trading options until this year because, get this, I thought I was too broke to take risks with my money.

Only now do I understand I couldn’t afford not to trade options.  5 years down the drain.
Show us your puts then
holy FUCK BAN this PRE-TEEN!!!!! Go use daddy’s card on a happy meal, and not shitty stock bets
I see where you're going with. It's a tough sell, you basically have to get everyone to agree on what "too rich" means. Interesting thought experiment.

Does this extend to corporations since they're as if a person entity? How would richness be tracked? Does tracking violate privacy? Is it even constitutional? Open a whole can of worms.

That’s why you keep practicing with your own logic and analysis and change thesis when you get negative results. Also change time slots(length of contracts).
I don’t know anything about stocks yet I somehow make money. Like I have no idea what a cash secured put is
Great question!


A share is a single unit of ownership in a company or financial asset.

It is essentially an exchangeable piece of value of a company which can fluctuate up or down, depending on several different market factors.

Hope this helps, looking forward to the paper trading competition, should do numbers, hopefully lots participate!
Im here bc life has no meaning when the market is closed
Congratulations you absolute legend. Inspiration for us all
It actually is a flip book showing the graph going down from 50mil to 1mil.
That’s true, but the biggest takeaway most should read here is how important it is to learn the basics. 

Learn charting & price action & how ER seasons work BEFORE you start gambling with options. Stocks are so much more forgiving of bad trades. You never need to blow up your account. 

Try adding leverage after you’ve already proven yourself successful.
Because you take a massive loss if you're wrong.
Same joke with farming.
You are mod after 7 trades.
Not with that attitude comparing ball sizes. You wouldn’t hire yourself.

Because dumping 10-15% in is smarter.  Really like it as a turnaround play.  I sold out of it at 300...thinking about buying back in

Nope, 10% tax bracket goes from 0-9875, 12% from 9876 to 40125.

Edit: obviously goes on from there, but just the more applicable part of the tax brackets

Edit 2: to be clear, return on investments would effectively be your income
Because you can only afford a fraction of a share. ;)

Technically, he briefly invested in the idea of investing in a company with an idea that could make some money, and when the idea became more attractive to more people, he sold it on, before people figured out that the idea was no good. Some day, I wish to be like him - using my own 2 hands to touch myself and trade hyped junk!"

Arkk. 

Tqqq is great for selling puts on for premium tho
There’s the big names: Amazon, Apple, Microsoft. 

Then there’s the middle of the road companies: Square, Visa, AMD, Nvidia

Then there’s the ETFs that have been doing very well, which you’d be most assured to get 5-8%, perhaps even more: ARKG, ARKK, ARKF, QQQ, SPY

Unfortunately, in this sub people want more than 5-8%, so this is where gamblers come. Basically, you’re asking a casino how you can make a steady paycheck. It’s probably not thru the casino.

This started in spring 2018 when I had 50 shares of IBM. I decided to sell all of them and reinvest because they seemed to be going nowhere. I invested in Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft. I let them sit for a bit and in the last two months I have decided to make some new risky investments and I am pretty happy with the outcome! More apple shares and some penny stocks here and there. I have a goal of reaching 60k in 2021!
I was just looking back at text and realized he asked me that in early Nov, then I didn’t reply and got the “yo” 🤷🏽

: This is not a psychotic episode. This is a cleansing moment of clarity. I'm imbued, Max. I'm imbued with some special spirit. It's not a religious feeling at all. It's a shocking eruption of great electrical energy. I feel vivid and flashing, as if suddenly I'd been plugged into some great electromagnetic field. I feel connected to all living things. To flowers, birds, all the animals of the world. And even to some great, unseen, living force. What I think the Hindus call prana. But it's not a breakdown. I've never felt more orderly in my life. It is a shattering and beautiful sensation. It is the exalted flow of the space-time continuum, save that it is spaceless and timeless and...of such loveliness. I feel on the verge of some great, ultimate truth. And you will not take me off the air for now or for any other spaceless time!

Start asking her to jump in the shower with you and get things started in there.  Not sure how old you are but a lot of young guys don’t understand the value of foreplay enough.  This would be a win-win.

Make it a habit, and tell her it’s because you feel self conscious about having sex while you stink.  Tell her it’s a turn on for you to feel fresh.  Make it a habit for both of you.

You’re welcome.
If you can make it 8 trades before a margin call, then you're already better than this sub.
I held for 11 months and was down over 50%. I honestly thought it was a shit China company. I also liquidated a lot of my mutual funds and risky penny stocks around that time and put a lot of that money into $SQ which has grown into my largest position.
That is my experience
Just a tip from a noob but on Monday it will probably spike up and then fall. It seems that hype builds up over weekends and at market open there is a frenzy to get in on the action. I learned this with GME 2 weeks ago. Bought in as many shares as I could afford and within an hour it dropped like 10% (maybe more I forget the numbers exactly now). I learned not to buy immediately at the open on Mondays. I can't confidently advise anyone though so do whatever you want with that information.

Can you explain like I'm 5 your conviction? I'm listening to podcasts, reading posts, studying charts for this ticker. Thx in advance.
T bought DirecTV which was a declining business model and skull fucked its goodwill into the ground. Then they pissed off their own customers having their customer reps literally try everything to convince people to install fucking satellite dishes on their homes. An obsolete technology now.

Then they acquired Time Warner so their "master" plan of pivoting and starting a streaming app would succeed. DIRECTV Now and then AT&T TV were both shit. Then they have their client reps selling fucking streaming to the customers who they all convinced to get a fucking satellite dish on their home. 

So NOW we have HBO Max which managed to piss off creatives industry-wide by doing dual releases even though...lets be honest its not a bad move, but they mishandled PR badly doing the whole year all at once.

With that all said. It's probably bullish next week for anyone who caught the dip.
congrats on your future inheritance

I never said we are going back to ATH. This is why I keep saying to look at market cap and not share price. ATH market cap is around $8B, which in present day share price would equate to around $125-140 due to the reduced number of shares outstanding. 

I like that you look at things skeptically, makes it harder to lose money. I am also taking a conservative approach, hence my base price target is at less than 1/2 the market cap from the previous cycle. Until Cohen actually takes over (if he does) and the new direction for the company is made clear, I am making my assumptions based on current management staying in charge and the current plan is left in place.

Even with that, $50 is the minimum price I expect us to reach by the end of 2021.

Elon, Thiel, Mama Su, JPow must have run a train on Ballsaccas wife a few times this year. Guy seems very salty.
Not every brokerage allows for a limit higher than 50% of current share price. But then again, I think Burry will sell out before retail investors, UNLESS Cohen has specifically talked with him about his support in the chance that a shareholder vote would be needed.

If not, as for Burry, $22/share would be a *fair* valuation (old unchanged GameStop) which is what his main goal was when he started investing in GME. If he stays in much longer with share around that price, I'm guessing either Cohen talked with him, or he believes their valuation has somehow gone up.

Great stuff. You've done better % wise than a ton of traders that I've worked with on the sells-side. This sub likes to shit on TA since it's the "in" thing to do, but it is a powerful tool and is always utilized in some capacity by everyone who is actually a decent trader (professional or retail).

**[Huang Guangyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huang Guangyu)**

Huang Guangyu, (simplified Chinese: 黄光裕; traditional Chinese: 黃光裕; pinyin: Huáng Guāngyù; Jyutping: Wong4 Kwong1 Yu6) (born 24 June 1969) was the Chairman of GOME Group, which is the largest consumer electronics retailer in China. He had a net worth of US$1.7 billion as of 2005, according to Forbes magazine's world's richest people ranking. In 2005, he was the richest man in China according to Time magazine. He was born and raised as a Christian.In 2006, he was forced by regulations to sell off 25% of GOME Group, as listed in Hong Kong, making his net worth US$2.5 billion, according to some sources.

Well all the ultra-rich are in bed with politicians regardless of the country, otherwise they won't be rich. But it doesn't matter much if the tide is turned on them.

There have been 2 precedents where the richest man of China going down after a government crackdown. [Huang Guangyu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Huang_Guangyu) ended up in jail. [Wang Jianlin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wang_Jianlin) recovered but lost a big chunk of his fortune. Jack Ma is an easier target because he is so obnoxious. Jack Ma is Benzos with Trump's personality. No common folk has sympathy for him.
Accurate!
It would have cost you nothing to not say that
Current analysis is that it will take a few days for shorts to cover. I predict that paperhands would mass sell on the first day and then it slightly dips before going to the moon.

You are a jack cunt
1. Kind of confused by your wording with "timeline for paying taxes", generally you get a lower tax burden for holding the positions for a year +1 day (capital gains tax rate) as opposed to less than a year (where you would just pay income tax). You can use up to $3k a year in losses to offset gains, anything over $3k can be carried forward until amount is exhausted.

2. Dont listen to WSB and you'll be fine. Understand basics of pricing and theta decay.

3. Apple will always be around and will always do well. If you want to try and use those gains for a more aggressive strategy then I'd say liquidate it (or at least partially) and play around with those giants. I'd say fuck around with the amount and see how much you can liquidate without killing yourself in taxes (since this has been held for long enough, will be either 15% or 20% depending on your tax bracket)
Lmfao EV/clean energy boom is literally just getting started wtf? They are all under 50 bucks now and they will be the 500% stocks this year just like tech last year
Dude can you clarify your comments so they are understandable?
Big pharma never moves up a lot. See JNJ and PFE. Even when it does, it pulls back. Only way it moves a lot is if they do something completely new like streaming, EVs, or exercise bikes with a screen to watch YouTube 😂

Lots of words aren't necessarily bad. What I find though is when people don't know what they're talking about they write up three paragraphs that are meaningless or could be reduced to a line or two.

Then even in a professional setting less is often better than more. Interning for a small ($125M AUM) VC firm I wrote DD reports and were entirely used two pagers.

Why isn’t Merck mooning as much as it should be? They’re coming out with a covid treatment which the government just ordered $350M worth. This is the kind of stuff needed going forward knowing that Covid isn’t going away for some time (at least according to some scientists), especially if the reopening is to happen soon.
My cynical side is thinking this is a cheap way ATT can justify shitty service during peak load
Started in April. Before then I just had 1 share of SPY in Robinhood that I was up $20 after 2 years.

Found this sub, first options trade was PRPL. Made $2k. Went back in and promptly lost it because I bought back in at the top.

So far I've lost $4k this year which is 90% of my portfolio. I've got $300 left.

I attribute most of my losses to having paper hands, doing earnings plays, and buying weekly calls at the top. Some meme stocks have gotten me back to $2k a few times but then I always do something stupid that brings me right back to a few hundred dollars.
🤣
OPEN THE MARKET!

I like Kirk for learning the mechanics of how to leg into trades or how trades work. I agree his premium that he sells is really low. I end up trading more aggressively than him by waiting for a pullback to the 8 or 21 EMA and then selling ATM put credit spreads. You can normally get a 1:1 risk:reward. I also like to do lotto butterflies by looking at max pain that can pay nicely sometimes. It can be boring at the start but once you start playing with broken wing butterflies and stuff it picks up

In addition to the other reply, the bomb cut out AT&T service including 911, also flights are currently stopped out of the Nashville airport due to the interruption.
Next year will still be covid and the tightening cycle starts Q3. But it will be so gradual so you could just fuck about for the entire year. We stay flat.
My uncle on Facebook says it could be BLM. Apparently awhile ago ATT didn’t do the black picture thing on Instagram so it’s retribution

Respect this guy for making solid gains this year. But there are thousands of people this year  that have crushed it on a few random stocks to use as confirmation bias. Pls be careful. This year literally everything has run up, most especially the speculative names. I’ve been trading/investing since 2004, and I can say that this year has been unlike any other, I’ve never even seen anything remotely close. Basically you could have closed your eyes and thrown darts, and it would be up 10,20,100% in the last 6 months. Even broken businesses like cruises, casinos, pet retailers, psychedelics, literally everything. If I went all in on garbage like Dave and busters or overstock I’d be a billionaire. TLDR, props to this dude for making money and doing his thing, but don’t fool yourself into thinking any of these strategies and results is replicable long term (or in any other year besides 2020)
Pops made a ~700k bet on Apple January of this year. Up ~350k so far
Started in July with a hundred. First call needed to be cheap and long so I could figure out how it worked. I bought vale. It was up 900% sold and bought longer better position. Bought funeral stocks and debt collection with some masks sprinkled in. I’m up 67% on the year.

Do you mostly buy leaps? Do you have positions other than Tesla?
Started trading in April was living paycheck to paycheck. I had absolutely nothing saved to the point I was having trouble feeding myself. Then rona stuck thankfully I was lucky and ended up with more hours than before and a $1200 stimulus check. Ended up dumping $1000 of it into the market and basically lost it immediately not wanting to give up I continued on the grind ended up putting a total of 5k into the market this year losing 60-70% before PLTR came and along. Went all in with options on it and sold day before thanksgiving for about 20k. Then my coworker kept talking up fubo and I said fuck it and threw almost 10k on $45C 2/19/21 sold Monday and now my account is sitting at just under 40k. In total it took about 7 months to become profitable but the roller coaster ride was insane and depressing until recently.

Why I have a feeling arkg is gonna do amazing things
That I know my good sir, that's why I got shares multiple to 9. My question is how? I get an email from my broker or something? Should I apply somewhere myself with the price and date? That is unclear to me tbh.
Two types of people in the marketplace. (Buyers)

1# is a  californian/new yorker that's figured out they have a "work from home job". Make good money($150K) & wants to escape covid city centres, wants a bigger house compared to a flat. Save on taxes and have more disposable income by moving out of the city. 


2# high-school dropout who never left his small hick town. Works in retail and has a wife and a house. Can't make the repayments on his house because all these shops are closed or never going to reopen (amazon)

Doesn't have a job, eaten into saving(playing weekly call options) and need to sell his house quick so he can move into a trailer-home or back in with his mom. He needs to sell the home quick because it has been increasing in value and doesn't want the bank to take it on the cheap. (Forebareance 12months with ballon repayment on month 12  for all missed payment) (ass bleeding)

I see motivation for person number 2 to sell to person number 1. (And these two people will be using Google to solve their problem's)

I disagree with you there. I don’t see Tesla’s valuation growing due to car sales.

He said Q1, and there's a good chance it's sell the news or a muted reaction since it's unlikely to be a hype stock. He's looking for a mature company. 

I already made 20%+ buying units at $21 and selling to overpaying noobs like you, I'm happy to wait to see what he gets and if it sells off to a reasonable valuation I may buy back in. It's sucj a big spac it won't gain a huge multiple because the valuation will be closer to correct than a small target.

This episode of 2020 is live action ManHunt  🤔👀
That cycle was 7 years ago when the following three factors were non-existent:

1. Pandemic
2. Decline in physical retail due to ecommerce (GME does not have a monopoly on console distribution)
3. Transition to gamers purchasing games DLC (GameStop isn't just about consoles)

Moreover, GameStop had revenue of $9 billion in 2013, making a $3 billion market cap reasonable. Whereas their revenue this year will be $6 billion, at best. 30% decline... yet you think a return to ATH is reasonable? Now if GameStop demonstrated some traction, shift and development of moat in e-commerce, I would agree with you, but that's just not there. There website looks like a flea market flyer designed in 1998. :/

looks like you sold out of GME earlier than you implied. your overall gain of $218k is lower than the gain you had when you posted last Friday (+$257k w/ GME @ $15.96). 

just thought this was interesting since the post said “continuing the road to multi-millionaire, who’s with me,” as if you were still fully invested in GME and were up until Wednesday with STIC.

i guess you did continue, but only until Monday morning when you sold around $15.50 per share. this isn’t bad and obviously respect the gains, but weird that you sold literally right at open on Monday after saying you were on the road to multi-millionaire via GME AH on Friday, and the fact that GME wasn’t even down that much (3% or so) means you likely had already planned to sell first thing Monday anyway? unless you saw that it was decently flat and within an hour or two decided to impulsively sell 88k shares of your “long term 10x”.

Options 1 and 2 (especially 1) are highly dependent of the share price. Basically the high the share price is, the more desperate the shorts are, and the PE/IBs are able to take more advantages from the deal.

So for option 1, Melvin would be forced to sell their other stocks at a higher discount and for option 2, the negotiated price would be higher. 

So just keep buying calls and roll them out until the squeeze happens to fuck Melvin over.

Look at the market cap from previous console cycles. $50 per share brings us to a market cap of about $3B, less than half of the market cap from the XB1/PS4 cycle (hit 6.5B during that time). There are many less shares outstanding than during previous cycles due to the 2019 buybacks, which means the share price spikes much more quickly as the market cap rises.

Started around march. I was already reading about stocks and understanding the market/following everything for years though, but I wasn’t old enough to buy stocks. This march when everything went to shit I saw the opportunity of a lifetime and I went all in with the money I had saved. Being a beginner, I lost some money and gained some, made a lot of mistakes. After all my account has gone up about 50% this year, but only the last month or two I have had real profit on my account. I feel like I have a shit ton of money for my age and all in all, this year has been great for me

I wil "end up" like you, from a trading strategy POV, except my tranistion will be faster.

Started with options about 2 month ago, went from 3k to 10k, then fucked up and bought PLTR Jan 15 35/40c when it was at 28.50, currently watching them burn to a crisp and down to 7k.

Luckily i also bought shares (of PLTR) so i'm selling CCs, all the while i have 5k on eToro from about 6 months ago that are all into GME and up a nice 25%.

Options are nice for the occasional massive omega gainz, i still plan to have 20% of my account dedicated to them, but stonks just give so much consistency with a virtually infinte timeframe at your disposal. Also selling CC is very nice, especially when your stonks are doing not so good!
Kanye killed that
this is kind of a silly point though. obviously you aren’t going to lose it all, but you’re also capping your gains. it’s a bit strange to say, shares are better because if the stock goes down 10%, you only lose 10%, whereas with options, you’d have lost 100%. that’s true, but you also would *never* be playing options for your entire account of $1.7m, because you don’t need to in order to capture the gains you’re targeting (i.e. the gains you get from pure shares). tbh, if anything OP is a perfect example of why options are so powerful. obviously the past is not indicative of the future, there was tremendous luck involved, etc. but if he had gone with options on these rather than shares, he could’ve invested half the money and literally made 2x, 3x+ the money he made. of course he’d have taken on a lot more risk, but let’s not act like options just have way more risk without noting the much larger return % over shares.

i actually also only do shares - no options. but just wanted to point this out because although it’s clear & everyone on here knows it, it seems easy to ignore because options are so easy to shit on given the % that expire worthless, gambly nature, etc.

But you won't.  And you'll have a narrative for that too.  Maybe you got smart or you got unlucky or you decided to settle down, or you realized that life isn't all about gains, whatever.  Some story.

$50  would be GME's valuation being near an ATH. What makes that reasonable at this time, considering the pandemic, erosion of physical retail, and the threat of  the shift of gamer behavior to purchasing games as DLC?
Okay. I guess that has to be true.

But they exercised not just because it happened to go ITM AH, but apparently they were expecting a big fall the next open.

As an aside: I didn't even know going ITM AH was still fair game to exercise. Now I definitely know to always close my positions myself on the final day.

well cathy bought some baba so hoping it goes up soon...
Only?places i been on reddit is girlsgonewild, hot wives, wsb and vegasbets. But both tgose tickers were hit with bad bad press dude. So bad press equals massive sell offs cuz shareholders dont mean shit to the chinese companies. You should go back to that sub you speak of the.

i.e. you as shareholders dont own shit except some shell company. And have no pull to help right a sinking ship, so why not sell.

You gotta learn those lessons to not make those mistakes that make you lose your bank.
Not enough volume to be the squeeze. Additionally, GME should be at $50 minimum to have a reasonable valuation (don't get blinded by share price, market cap is the key thing to look at). There is updated data on Ortex (short interest went up slightly) but I do not have an account and therefore can't easily share a screenshot.

It’s kind of also to officially get the names down on paper to who is against it as well. I think the dems will then kind of take that to the media and say “see these are the people keeping the money from you”
So the massive RV bomb was well made and broadcasted a message for people to evacuate, it caused police to shut off the gas to the ATT building to shut off services.  Sounds like they didn’t want to hurt anyone but the intention was to take out ATT.

Knew nothing about stocks, always hear about it never bothered. Saw motley fool and decided to try it, best decision ever. Idk why people shit on this boomer website from what I read. I just got into stocks in February of this year buying CRWD avg $109 a share and now it's $225 per share. It makes most of my portfolio. Invest literally almost all of my savings (like 85%) and I'm up nearly 30% YTD ($7k invested $2k return)

I learned so much from Motley, youtube videos, discord channels, and WSB. I'm so glad I got into stocks and realize it's potential I'm hoping one day I'll hit big at least $5-$10k on a stock and take a trip back to Japan

So I just found out one of my brothers opened margin and went all in on NKLA on (roughly) November 24th..

Talk about FOMO..

Apparently when I sent him a video explaining how Nikola is fake and the truck was pushed down the hill, he didn’t actually watch it and thought I was sending it as a recommendation for NKLA

Edit: added roughly because I’m not 100% sure but it was on or a few days before the peak

Explain
Started in May 2019 with stocks. Started options during the crash ~Feb. went up 50% from 10k to 15k. Once QE started I was a permabear and slowly went down to 2k from the original 10. Stopped trading in May. Started re-investing the boomer way in the fall. Sticking to a low-risk, low-reward portfolio because options were hurting my mental health and marriage. Buying to hold everything, mutual funds, value stocks, dividends, you name it. Will take a couple years to recoup my losses but I’m out of the gambling game forever. I only participate in the weekend thread here because frankly I don’t really belong here anymore.

To the moon you say?
Started in January and went all in on tesla stock with 6-7k. Paper handed and sold at a loss to buy a spy put at the bottom during march, lost 50%. Went cash for a while then broke even with elons tesla stock price too high imo and buying nikola warrants. Took a break and went back into tesla shares right before the snp inclusion announcement. Got into arkk, arkg, qqqj, and icln leaps which all have been printing. Ytd up ~62%. It's been a wild year.
I havent run the numbers but I think a decent percent of ARK return comes from the 0.2-1% allocations. Some of those are extremely high growth with 5-10x over a few months then they sell. I'd like to see you beat the ETF returns with just the stocks you mentioned (definitely possible but just saying)

I'm looking on Cathies ark her xlnx position and she's been dumping bigly for months on end. I'm up 40% on xlnx so far and I'm thinking this is a sell signal?

Ark https://cathiesark.com/ark-combined-holdings-of-xlnx

I suspect it's because xlnx is being bought by amd and Cathies conviction on amd isn't as strong as it is on xlnx? Not sure what to do to be honest. I personally think amd could be a trillion dollar company in 10 years.

any update on stimmy or something?
I'm spreading my time between here and Parkour fail videos.  Got the rona shits.
OP is a cunt
All I'm saying is curb your expectations. I've been waiting for this squeeze for months. I'm only holding shares now, sold my calls on Tues and Wed. There's 2 ways to play GME. Recognize that's it's a beaten down stock, and with Cohen, has a bright future, and if it so happens to squeeze, all the better. 

I'm fully expecting this to consolidate and probably retest the  $18 zone again, which is where I plan to start buying calls again. If it approaches $15 - $16, I'll probably back the truck up and go HAM.
Lol. You fired yet?
not OP but personally i sell calls at 22 and sell puts at 12. which means i'm willing to buy shares at 12 and short it at 22.
I really enjoyed the last one.. and there should be something to win like a ps5! Time to motivate all the new folks!
Imagine getting an invite to u/vegasbets because you suck off a retard that trades SPCE. And for anyone reading this that’s in Vegas, ask your boy for proof of some of his winning trades🤡
Doing calls on this is just too risky, imo. Im holding on 100 shares of feye. We could see the stock pop to 30 after biden takes office and either hits back and/or announces that theyre shopping around for a better company

Started trading in December 2019, had around 1,000 dollars in, grew it about 60%, decided to toss another 9K in, bought 6000 worth of Tesla before joining the Air Force, got out of basic training and somehow still had money after buying 3 shares at 2,000 dollars. 2 months later I'm up 70% on 10K - pretty much a held stocks, not many options. Crisper, Virgin Galactic, Cloudflare, AMD, Tesla and a 1500 dollar gain on quantumscape that I got lucky on. Sold all of my Tesla and QS and put it in Apple and ARKK.

Dude. Buy SPCE. I went up 50% in the last 2 months, it just took a nose dive because the test flight didn’t go quite as planned. They are rearing to go back up realllyyyyyy soon. Probably in January. Reached $35 on hype of the flight wouldn’t had a 40-50 PT in success. Even if you just wanna sell the news I’d keep eyes on man. I expect 100+ EOY 2021
As another poster that made a considerable amount of money in coins prior to the 2017 runup and also got lucky buying some stocks around that time, OP is a lucky idiot that will likely never ever repeat what he has done here. 

He will likely keep chasing the dragon and lose it all. Do like me and spend some of that money bro. Go buy a sexy RV paid off with cash then travel the world since you don't need to worry about a job. 

Outfit your RV with the gangsterist solar and internet setups and then go trade your penny stocks on top of a mountain. 

Go live your life. Sucks that corona is happening right now so that's why I really recommend the RV life. 

Either way you got lucky as fuck. Spend some of that money so you can't lose it and just let the rest ride. Get a financial planner to help you plan for retirement because with your current holdings you may be able to spend like $200k+ per year in retirement.

Absolutely. Remember the end of October selloff? People were losing hope and he swung down like 1MM in less than a week. A few people were piling in to stick it to him.

[u/DeepFuckingValue](https://www.reddit.com/u/DeepFuckingValue/), you are an example to traders of the power of a well-reasoned long thesis and strong conviction. I hope they learn from this and, combined with good luck, prosper in their own plays. Merry Christmas to you and yours!

Small account, worth just over 1k. I can’t complain about those gains in that time :)

Ya. Money withdrew for taxes and down payment on home. I’ve posted video on largest gain position which was four TSLA $680c 01/2021 bought pre-split in summer 2019 for $420. I just sold that position for $1,038,000. I also made $800K on thirty TSLA $690c 06/2020 that I bought for $23 per contract. I sold some in February and then bought sixteen $1000 presplit contracts expiring in 2021 and 2022 in March during crash. That is about 80-90% of profits.

Nothing happens.  Unless their borrow gets called in and the broker can't backfill their borrow with other shares.
Could be a disgruntled employee. Very specifically targeted but also trying to avoid loss of life. As always, we'll learn more as time passes. Strange.

Bull pullback in a bear trend :)
Did he even beat inflation/other costs?
Do you even know what RC is trying to do? Obviously it’s speculative but the bull thesis completely disregards the squeeze. Cyclical console stock and pivoting to online business is it. If they refuse to change and RC doesn’t take aggressive action they could die off but bulls don’t think that will happen. You do you but I’m so tired of seeing the same rehashed bear bullshit pretending everything is riding on a mythical squeeze

The current pace of QE is basically in line with QE2, maybe a little bit higher.

You’re thinking of JMIA
What I’m not necessarily confident in (longer term) is the sustainability of originators like UWM given current and future market conditions for their moat. UWM is not the only player in the game (far from it). SoFI, Rocket (Quicken Loans), Better Mortgage (best of them all thus far as admitted by friends of mine who work for Rocket) are also players in the field and are far more tech-reliant than UWM. UWM maintains the customer->sales person->Underwriting cycle in their process while Better Mortgage for instance eliminated (in essence) the salesperson from the equation (which for the most part was my personal reason of going with them when refinancing a couple months ago). So take that part of it into consideration as well since it is becoming the new norm (see Carvana in another space which is doing really well by eliminating that “overhead” to lessen the burden on the customer/end user). Furthermore, I (personally) think we’ll see higher rates coming sooner than later which will make the appeal factor of these companies dwindle since they simply won’t generate as much revenue due to lesser demand (refi is their bread and butter at the moment - somewhere above 60% of business for all the aforementioned companies). This also depends on your position - if you got in at or near NAV ($10-ish) take some profits when you see fit (50% seems like a good starting point for sure) then let the rest ride as you see fit. You should also keep in mind the reason for companies like this going public: either they need their initial investors to cash out (not the case with UWM as it was mostly funded by their revenues), OR they foresee a reduction in business coming up which will result in a need for other means of funding  (shareholders) to supplement their cash flow. Just FYI: I am overly cautious when it comes to long term investment and maintain a healthy dose of skepticism so as to not get burned. Hope this helps, take it with a grain of salt and may you be blessed with many tendies. Cheers!

Haha. Fair enough. I just wasn't sure if there was normally a post Christmas to EOY trend.

Buckle up
There are only two companies who have proven they can build more than a trial run of charging stations, Telsa and Chargepoint. Tesla stations don't even work with other brands of cars, and I wouldn't hold my breath waiting for Elon to decide to make it his personal mission to juice up Mercedes and Fords when he's just trying to keep pace with his own brand.

Cities are low bid, but if I show up with a plastic beach shovel and bucket and say I can do it for $20, they're not even going to let me in the room.

Incorrect. Millennials are capable of progression, IE we are all progressive retards. 

As millennials we don’t need to burn it all down and start over, we are comfortable with change, in fact we encourage and embrace it.

This isn’t anyone clinging, this is a company that has the potential to go from 0 to hero in a relatively short time span. 

We recognize potential. We buy our tickets and hang on for the ride. We are millennials.

Buying straight puts is only valuable if you think the market is going down in the very near future. I.e. March 

Otherwise, when it’s more ambiguous like it is currently, you can still be long but hedge the downside with some puts along the way. If we do start trending down, you mitigate losses and can then transition to a more bearish position if you choose.

Playing pure bear positions into a retardedly strong bull market is fighting gravity though
I don't even know what those are so...

Wall Street and shorts have no clue about TSLA. At least another 5 fold coming. Another 15 fold is likely. Tesla should not be viewed as a carmaker. Tesla's revenue will reach 2T+ per year by 2030. I don't do spreadsheet extrapolation like those MBA idiots. I can think. The real kicker is they will have high margin on that 2T revenue. The most likely price target is $10k by 2032, supported by stable revenue and earnings.
That doesn't mean it will go there in a straight line. Pullbacks can happen and will happen occasionally.

Buying the baba dip is a really smart move if you buy shares and just hold it for a few years. Baba will break 1000 by 2021 or 2022 no if’s ans or buts. The company has more potential than Amazon and Shopify. Those who are holding through this temporary buying opportunity kudos to you for thinking ahead more than a week unlike most people on here
Maybe run by the Instagram page?
Will probably go to interactive brokers. They have margin at 0.86%. Don’t use margin currently but need to exercise all these options to avoid taxes on the big positions. I have 85 options I would like to e exercise next year but need $1.6M for that.

Bought leaps at the bottom. No guarantees but I think it’s still a very solid bet. The risks aren’t really operational, and ultimately the macro regulation (i.e forcing exclusive supplier contracts) shouldn’t cripple their value to this extent.

Merry Christmas fellow autists. May Santa deliver you tendies and you can cut down the blowing behind Wendy's to every other day!
Do 'the wheel. Sellers of options create contracts which can be traded until date of expiry. You can easily make $200 a week with that money selling weekly puts on Palantir or Gamestop and build slowly. If you are assigned, sell covered calls above or at the strike price. You can do spreads too. Sometimes just holding is better.

Merry Christmas everyone! Let’s pray for another 50% gain next year
I'm not sure how you think the government in California works differently than any other. No one who gets elected to be the chief dog catcher knows how to inflate their own car tires, they don't know how to handle high voltage, high power, weatherproof, not burning the city block down construction projects. Everything is contracted, why would this be different? They look around, ask "who knows how to do this?!?," see a brand name on the chargers down the block, and hand those people a *lot* of money.

BTW, "is there more to it than being an oversized wall outlet?"

My Christmas present to you is: don't be that guy who thinks "anything I don't understand is easy." That guy is an asshole at parties and never achieves anything with his own work. Assume things you don't understand are hard, because of course they are.
Voted - Gained a lot of money, because I gained a lot of money jumping in immediately at the time of posts instead of waiting until ATH moments driven by FOMO. Thanks for the tendies Señor-Yack-A-Lot! Merry Xmas!

Facts. This is actually great logic to apply to all facets of life. Regrets are only valuable if they inform future decisions. It’s easy to look back and identify mistakes in the past but surprisingly hard to identify the same mistakes in the present while you still have the opportunity to change them. Not necessarily a comfortable process but I think one of the best ways to grow is to force yourself to use those past mistakes to actively shape your future. 

Not to get all gay and philosophical but since this lightbulb went off for me, it has really improved my risk management and trading in general.
Yes sir!! I joined last time and I learned so much!! I recommended it to all our news users! Especially the younger, inexperienced ones!
> ah ty i see, but why would i want to balance my delta if i am bullish?

You might not want to. I just suggested it as a possibility. A situation in which you would do this is if you want to be long but not as long as your current position entails. 

> and if i wanted to balance it, can’t i just buy a put contract with the appropriate delta?

Yes exactly, or sell calls.

I have both shares and calls in VSAT and SATS, competing satellite broadband companies.  They're both still down 50% from yearly highs.  Their biggest business is providing satellite broadband internet to airlines.  While airlines have come back a lot, these two have been so far overlooked.  

With vaccine being distributed, it's time for these two to recover.  Looks like a realistic chance to double up within the next year.

Please God, I want to impregnate Elon Musk so bad. I want him to bear my children with those beautiful child-bearing hips. That beautiful, radiant angel. Like a goddess, having come down to Earth to cleanse us of our sins.

Elon Musk is beyond divine. I can't help but drop to my knees in worship whenever I see his beautiful figure even though it's behind that unnecessary gym clothes. I yearn for him in a way both Primal and spiritual. I would commit more war crimes than every president in United States history just to lick the sweet, glistening sweat from his smooth, creamy skin. I want to listen to his moans as my manhood throbs within him, I want to hear his heart race as our bodies become one and our souls irreversibly intertwine in the holy sin of carnal union.

I want to suckle at his fatherly bosom, slurping that rich juche milk from his teat as he gently strokes my raging erection. I would stir his velvety cream into my coffee and let my balls boil in it. His cries of pleasure and the rocking of our bed would be louder than the cacophony of ten thousand drone strikes. I would make love to him until my body gave out, and then some. I would let him break my rib cage with any part of his body. I would let him hit me with his TSLA just to be near him for a brief moment.

He's so perfect it hurts. Every moment without him I suffer a pain worse than breaking every bone in my body simultaneously while drowning and also having shards of glass coated in hot sauce forced through every orifice of my body. I want him, I need him. I want to desecrate his crisp general suit. I want to start a family with him and retire after our twenty seven children have grown up and moved out.

I would encase myself in cement and become his doorstep, so that he may wipe his heels upon my face. I would tear my own limbs off. I don't know what l'd do after that, or why he might want my limbs. But I would do it.

My queen, my goddess, the light of my life. Please God, let me have him. I want him to be mine and only mine. I would lick the Doritos dust from his fingers and fill his belly button with honey mustard to dip my tendies in. I would give him a sponge-bath with my tongue every morning and serve him breakfast in bed. I would let him eat his eggs and pancakes off my body if it pleased him, no matter how painful the third-degree burns would be.

Can someone who has done the research explain to me why charge stations will be profitable at all? If I was california I would just build my own charge stations using carbon tax dollars right into my road infrastructure design. Is there more to it than it just being an oversized wall out let? These cities and states already have government owned electrical companies, might as well just build this new infrastructure through them and have a gov. department oversee it?
Don't do it, man. Not worth it. Put in what you can afford to lose. 

Sure, you might be right and feel awful afterwards for not having bought with both hands. 

But if you're wrong? And there's a not insignificant chance you \*are\* wrong. 

Just buy what you can with what you can afford to lose; don't do it on margin or borrow. Big Daddy Buffett himself famously said that the only three ways smart people can go broke is liquor, ladies, and \*leverage.\* Don't accidentally lever yourself off a cliff thinking you're going to get to Heaven. 

If you feel like you need to take a big shot at GME, go for some OTM calls at strikes you can afford to lose if it goes to zero.
FEYE is a best though the volume is insane this stock is gonna move I’m just not sure which way and I got into this way uneducated compared to my other bets so I’ve just lost money on every call/put on SWI MSFT and FEYE
Started at the literal bottom on March 16th. I threw in 8k and hit 58k early June, cashed out 25k, lost like 5k until November and now I’m up to 70k. 

So overall 8k ->95k since March. No trading experience prior, basically just learned from the daily thread and some astoundingly retarded moves.

UK ban and now Japan ban of petrol cars in 2030, yup its rise and shine time, EVs are going to Disneyland!
call charles schwab, fidelity or any real broker. tell them you have $5m that you want to transfer to their brokerage.create account with them  give them info. done. you dont have to do shit. you can even go to a charles S retail location. 

best one to get is charles. get a brokerage and a checking with them.  they give you a checking atm card that you can withdrawal money from any atm in the world. zero fees. they reimburse. if you are at a strip club in Vegas and the machine charges you $20 to withdrawal $100? no problem. charles will reimburse

with $5M you could just buy boomer stocks with divvies. and auto transfer divvies from charles brokerage to charles checking every month. thats like $30k a month if it was all in T.

grats and fuck you
Please God, I want to impregnate Cathie Wood so bad. I want her to bear my children with those beautiful child-bearing hips. That beautiful, radiant angel. Like a goddess, having come down to Earth to cleanse us of our sins.

Cathie Wood is beyond divine. I can't help but drop to my knees in worship whenever I see her beautiful figure even though it's behind that unnecessary gym clothes. I yearn for her in a way both Primal and spiritual. I would commit more war crimes than every president in United States history just to lick the sweet, glistening sweat from her smooth, creamy skin. I want to listen to her moans as my manhood throbs within her, I want to hear her heart race as our bodies become one and our souls irreversibly intertwine in the holy sin of carnal union.

I want to suckle at her motherly bosom, slurping that rich juche milk from her teat as she gently strokes my raging erection. I would stir her velvety cream into my coffee and let my balls boil in it. Her cries of pleasure and the rocking of our bed would be louder than the cacophony of ten thousand drone strikes. I would make love to her until my body gave out, and then some. I would let her break my rib cage with any part of her body. I would let her hit me with her car just to be near her for a brief moment.

She's so perfect it hurts. Every moment without her I suffer a pain worse than breaking every bone in my body simultaneously while drowning and also having shards of glass coated in hot sauce forced through every orifice of my body. I want her, I need her. I want to desecrate her crisp general suit. I want to start a family with her and retire after our twenty seven children have grown up and moved out. I want to see those luscious lips speak such filthy, perverse words into my ear while she slides ice cubes down my gaping pisshole.

I want to fuck her like she owes me money. I would let her step on me, just to feel the soft, firm warmth of her feet upon my face and groin area. I would sleep under her just to catch her drool in my mouth. I would fish the strands of hair from her shower drain just to smell her alluring scent, and braid them into necklaces to keep her with me always. Or cock rings. Whichever would please her more.

God please, I would do anything for her. I would relinquish my life, all my hopes and dreams, just to become the socks on her feet so that I may warm her mouthwatering toes with my very being, so that she may feel the heat of my love always. I would encase myself in cement and become her doorstep, so that she may wipe her heels upon my face. I would tear my own limbs off. I don't know what l'd do after that, or why she might want my limbs. But I would do it.

My queen, my goddess, the light of my life. Please God, let me have her. I want her to be mine and only mine. I would lick the Doritos dust from her fingers and fill her belly button with honey mustard to dip my tendies in. I would give her a sponge-bath with my tongue every morning and serve her breakfast in bed. I would let her eat her eggs and pancakes off my body if it pleased her, no matter how painful the third-degree burns would be.

I would bear the torment of eternal damnation until the end of time to taste the seat of her car but once. There is nothing I wouldn't do for her, nothing wouldn't say. I would beat my own friend to death with my engorged penis if it would bring a smile to Cathie Wood’s shining face. I wouldn't even let myself Cum until she gave me permission.

I love you, Cathie Wood. Please. Be mine. Be my wife, my Lover, my mommy, my everything. Say yes. Answer my calls, respond to my letters. Something. Give me a sign, Cathie. I'm waiting for you.

I’ll always be waiting for you.

[deleted]
It's completely driven by the options market and OTM calls. Seems like goldman and softbank just led the charge upward and forced delta hedging by MMs. You can do this with literally any asset as long as the OTM calls keep flowing like water.
With the amount of stonks I buy and sell, one man couldn't possibly research all the non-sense every pos compnay does.

So what’s the plan? Please change your tax residence to a state without income tax. It will instantly save you $500k+ in state income tax when you eventually realize those gains.

Chargepoint has been way less exciting (read: full of bullshit) than almost all of these EV stocks.

They're a real company who actually make charging stations that are actually all over the place already and people are actually using them right now.

Someone has to replace all the gas stations in California/the world, and these guys are the biggest player already. When the gubermint is trying to find something to throw money at for green infrastructure stimulus, who do you think they'll find?
But god told norm!
TIL options trading is a wall street secret
I mean, sure, but managing billions of dollars is different than managing $10k and turning it into $75k.
I have a problem. I keep maneuving my mind to hunt for potential good news in Tesla/EV industry resulting in an increased level of confirmation bias. It's like a heroine addict finding ways to achieve their next high. In view of this, thank you Pete Buttigieg. Far OTM calls on the table Monday.

Opened a Roth IRA the second I turned 18, bought big on NFLX (this was 4 years ago). Sorta played around with that for a little (really just watching NFLX grow), opened a RH account probably 2 years ago, was doing more of the same. Discovered options this year during quarantine and strictly played them on my Robinhood, took my account from 18 grand to 30, then back down to 19. Scrapped playing weeklies and dailies, focused on mostly shares and I'm up to about 60k across all accounts rn.
Or, literally do nothing - the easiest thing of all, and provided your option was not some retarded 0dte you were probably somewhat okay.

Every company has catalyst though, but at this point it's all just a narrative. I don't disagree that there are probably plenty upcoming positive "TSLA" catalyst, but we've all been hearing about all the different ways TSLA is going to take over the world and dominate countless industries. The difference between TSLA and any other company with just as many easy to spin narratives is that TSLA translates their narrative/sentiment into price increases like non other, and those price increases go into hyper drive (or did) with insane OTM call options.  


This is why I agree with you that price could still keep going up despite how counter intuitive it "should" be, but also why I still stand by my stance that TSLA investors at this point in time are simply investing in a greater fool model (I like elon and TSLA, and expect a massive stock correction followed by a healthy long term growth over the decade).

The FDA has never ever approved anything that later on was deemed harmful. Cuz the FDA isn’t made up of humans who are susceptible to error. It’s an all knowing alien being that is never ever wrong. So, is a shit company like MRNA that has never created anything, has no track record and the CEO is a buddy of the president. 

I’m not an anti-vaxxer my kids are vaccinated. But, just as we don’t know enough about the disease we don’t know about it vaccine either.
If your employer 401k is through fidelity and if they allow you, there is an option on your net benefits page to open a brokerage link account through fidelity. Then you can transfer all your 401k funds to this account and buy anything you want. You can youtube fidelity 401k brokerage link. It's all the same page for anyone who's employer uses Fidelity. Obviously other employers allow this like OP who uses vanguard but I know how mine works.

This mine has tried to do this before under Molycorp and it wasn’t successful. This time the EV sector is prime to have this mine be a success one would think. They have all the resources there and are in production mode. The question is can they compete with China’s prices? Molycorp went bankrupt because they couldn’t sell their rare earth products due to China lowering their price. MP has to show it can compete in this industry and that it can withstand this situation again. $200 is very unlikely for any miner Rio Tinto’s stock ath was around $104. MP stock still has potential but profitability and future contracts must be proved in their earnings...it could be a winner

I know this sub doesn't want to hear nor care for TA, but GME is at a historical resistance level and $20 is a good even number where people would most likely place a sell order and take their profits. A squeeze is probably the only thing that can break us out.

Bruh ccl leaps have to be the move right somebody tell me I’m right.

Plz stop downvoting this was meant for my diary not wsb. ☹️☹️

Please God, I want to impregnate Belle Delphine so bad. I want her to bear my children with those beautiful child-bearing hips. That beautiful, radiant angel. Like a goddess, having come down to Earth to cleanse us of our sins.

Belle Delphine is beyond divine. I can't help but drop to my knees in worship whenever I see her beautiful figure even though it's behind that unnecessary gym clothes. I yearn for her in a way both Primal and spiritual. I would commit more war crimes than every president in United States history just to lick the sweet, glistening sweat from her smooth, creamy skin. I want to listen to her moans as my manhood throbs within her, I want to hear her heart race as our bodies become one and our souls irreversibly intertwine in the holy sin of carnal union.

I want to suckle at her motherly bosom, slurping that rich juche milk from her teat as she gently strokes my raging erection. I would stir her velvety cream into my coffee and let my balls boil in it. Her cries of pleasure and the rocking of our bed would be louder than the cacophony of ten thousand drone strikes. I would make love to her until my body gave out, and then some. I would let her break my rib cage with any part of her body. I would let her hit me with her car just to be near her for a brief moment.

She's so perfect it hurts. Every moment without her I suffer a pain worse than breaking every bone in my body simultaneously while drowning and also having shards of glass coated in hot sauce forced through every orifice of my body. I want her, I need her. I want to desecrate her crisp general suit. I want to start a family with her and retire after our twenty seven children have grown up and moved out. I want to see those luscious lips speak such filthy, perverse words into my ear while she slides ice cubes down my gaping pisshole.

I want to fuck her like she owes me money. I would let her step on me, just to feel the soft, firm warmth of her feet upon my face and groin area. I would sleep under her just to catch her drool in my mouth. I would fish the strands of hair from her shower drain just to smell her alluring scent, and braid them into necklaces to keep her with me always. Or cock rings. Whichever would please her more.

God please, I would do anything for her. I would relinquish my life, all my hopes and dreams, just to become the socks on her feet so that I may warm her mouthwatering toes with my very being, so that she may feel the heat of my love always. I would encase myself in cement and become her doorstep, so that she may wipe her heels upon my face. I would tear my own limbs off. I don't know what l'd do after that, or why she might want my limbs. But I would do it.

My queen, my goddess, the light of my life. Please God, let me have her. I want her to be mine and only mine. I would lick the Doritos dust from her fingers and fill her belly button with honey mustard to dip my tendies in. I would give her a sponge-bath with my tongue every morning and serve her breakfast in bed. I would let her eat her eggs and pancakes off my body if it pleased her, no matter how painful the third-degree burns would be.

I would bear the torment of eternal damnation until the end of time to taste the seat of her car but once. There is nothing I wouldn't do for her, nothing wouldn't say. I would beat my own friend to death with my engorged penis if it would bring a smile to Belle Delphine’s shining face. I wouldn't even let myself Cum until she gave me permission.

I love you, Belle Delphine. Please. Be mine. Be my wife, my Lover, my mommy, my everything. Say yes. Answer my calls, respond to my letters. Something. Give me a sign, Belle. I'm waiting for you.

I’ll always be waiting for you.
NKLA is such a shitshow

This is big brain until the EV bubble inevitably pops
.0 delta means you are neutral (in terms of which way you think the price will go). 

Anything above .0 means you are long delta (you think the price will go up)

Anything below .0 means you are short delta (you think the price will go down). 

100 shares of a stock equals 1.00 delta. People would refer to this as 100 delta. The .29 you referred to would be called a 29 delta position. 

I suggested selling a long delta position or buying a short delta position to bring your overall position closer to 0. This would limit your potential gains if you were to hold all positions to expiration. Don't forget you don't have to have all your moves at the same DTE. Give your positions time to materialize too. Just because you weren't right on day 1 or 2 doesn't mean your plan won't materialize.
Hahaha yeah who would ever do that 🙄🙄🙄

It was undervalued.

When their management problems came to light, analysts correctly lowered their fair value. BUT the market price went way below that, and dropped further in Covid. Now the new plane is fixed, and hopefully there's been some reorganization on the inside. Either way, I bought at near rock bottom and sold when it went north of 200.

Wtf is this gay shit
Merry Christmas kids. Here is my present to you: my boring boomer trade that will get you 55% in a year almost guaranteed.

"But Al, taking a whole year to get a return that some guy in Connecticut would get paid more money than I've heard of to do is so stupid and boring! It's not enough to crush 90% of funds out there, I need to retire later this week."

Yeah you're right, sorry this isn't for you. Anyone who is left, check this out:

Jan 2022 SBE 45 puts are selling around $25.

You sell them, cash secured. You put up $4500, and some lunatic gives you $2500, right now. You just hold onto that. SBE is merging with Chargepoint, and if you can't figure out the value in building actual EV charging stations instead of rolling hollow trucks downhill, I don't know what to tell you.

Best case scenario, you end up with a 55% return when these expire OTM.

Worse case scenario, you end up with shares of a kickass EV stock that outperformed PLTR this year at a cost basis less than half the current price, and end up making way more when those moon. California is banning gas motor sales in less than 15 years, and that's a lot of charging stations that need to be built. The rest of the world is following fast.
this is my second biggest holding behind only arkk

One issue is that BABA is a shell company that takes profits from Alibaba. So in owning BABA you own no stake in Alibaba or associated businesses.

So that company could basically shut up shop, shares fall to $0 and Alibaba continue to trade as normal.

Thanks for sharing your heart warming tale. Sort of inspiring. I can definitely relate to having sheer luck (both good and bad) at entry and exit points, and I too am staying away from options, having been burnt too often.

To your second point about sharing your next trade, for those that follow your account, they should get a notification when you post something new. It showed up as the first thing on reddit when I opened the app. Congrats on your good fortune. If you get another good lead, I'd definitely be interested in at least knowing about it.

Lol check my comment history so many fights with people claiming reinfections can’t occur, all evidence is only anecdotal even though dozens post on             r/COVID19positive , when a mainstream article does come out because they’re favorite athlete or celebrity is sick again they still claim well it’s just 1 in a million, well duh! they brushed off hundreds off stories until it happens to their own family Calls on stay at home products as r/COVID19positive sub members rise, it’s been averaging up 500-1k members a day. 
BTI 3/19/21 C $55 
BTI 3/19/21 C $50
 The next vaccine will be BTI not because I believe it’s a pump and dump which it may well be but I strongly believe that tobacco is the cure to corona because it inhibits ACE-2 receptors. China put out early research suggesting high caseload among smokers but quickly realized daily tobacco smokers were hospitalized 50% less on average compared to population. France has also put out promising Nicotine research. This is the enviable next step towards tobacco vaccine and hopefully it works because 
A.) Britain is fucked and they’re British-American tobacco they will have domestic buyers and government support, 
B.) their vaccine will be shelf stable meaning high demand and heavy shipment to Third world countries who don’t have deep freezers if approved

If approved I’ll take this vaccine, I can’t believe everyone here is pure conspiracist, says it doesn’t exist and lives in Florida or Texas you guys are morons and sorry I’m not sure how to add page breaks

I too am NEVER going to hold through another earnings. What a bunch of bs they are. I'd rather miss a small spike than to take a 20% haircut in a day. And if the earnings are good, buy the DIP.
Ok, but do you disagree with most of what I said? Just because the stock price has gone up and might go up more, you’re just buying with the greater fool theory as your main catalyst at this point, and that’s just not my cup of tea.

plenty of retards here buy EV companies with no product and just hype. NKLA is no product no hype. heavily shorted. working prototype in a few years and it moons

whats the plan with the buying power? please do not leave it sitting in there
Man the CCP isn’t some crazy boys that love self destruction, yes they have the power to destroy BABA if the want unlike in western countries but they won’t do it because doing that would mean that they will lose any credibility in the stock market for at least a decade. The only geopolitical argument they have when challenging the US leading role is saying that they are growing, they got money to invest in 3rd world countries, they can’t lose credibility on that.

Started in February of this year actively trading (Yikes)

I have maxed my 401k out for years in fairly aggressive funds but wanted to do something with my extra capital. 

Got blown out in March because, who the fuck didn't. Had to learn during one of the craziest bull markets in history. 

Was down about 30k at one point but I just passed break even last week and am now up 5% for the year. 

Now I am theta gang and shares with the occasional yolo and have been making steady gains every month. 

Looking forward to 2021 now that I popped my trading cherry. 

Positions. 

Spy 400c x5 1/2023

Crsr - 3 call sells and 2 put sells plus 300 shares

Fubo - 2 put sells plus 200 shares

Icln - 30c 7/2021 x20

Aapl - 200 shares

VUG - 50 shares

30% cash

Merry Christmas, and keep grinding.
expiry?
Thanks!
I don’t think it would be scalable once you reach a certain point. Nor would I really want to take that much risk in a single stock with that much money. I am trying out this strategy to build up capital

https://www.nytimes.com/2020/01/09/business/boeing-737-messages.html

>Last year, Boeing disclosed internal messages from 2016, in which a top pilot working on the plane told a colleague that he was experiencing trouble controlling the Max in a flight simulator and believed that he had misled the F.A.A. "I basically lied to the regulators (unknowingly)," the pilot, Mark Forkner, said to his colleague, Patrik Gustavsson. Boeing did not inform the F.A.A. about the messages when the company first discovered them, waiting until about two weeks before Mr. Muilenburg was set to testify in front of Congress to send them to lawmakers.

>In another set of messages, employees questioned the design of the Max and even denigrated their own colleagues. “This airplane is designed by clowns, who are in turn supervised by monkeys,” an employee wrote in an exchange from 2017.

Did the monkeys go away? I doubt it.

You'd think Boeing wouldn't want to make these mistakes twice, but if you actually go and read about the lead-up to the 737 MAX disaster, you'll find out that they knew this was going to be a problem and they tried to hide it anyway. Why would a multibillion dollar company try to hide the unhideable? I don't know, ask them...all I know is they did it, and there's no reason to think they wouldn't do it again. Even if it makes no sense whatsoever. It made no sense the first time, but it still happened.

I've been long GME since September. I'll let the chart speak for itself.

Don’t believe this guy, get your calls ready. Remember buy when everyone is fearful and sell when everyone is greedy.

Yes unfortunately
Yeah I see a bunch of people saying they put their whole life savings into one stock in hopes it goes up, which to me sounds really risky. I have some money saved up I’m just playing around with tryna learn everything. I’ve actually been learning a lot in the past few days just reading everywhere and listening to other people talk about their stocks, I bought some books and started watching YouTube videos and listening to podcasts because I don’t want to lose anything though I’m sure eventually I will lose something. I just want to know everything there is so when I get on my broker app I can actually read everything that’s going on and know what to look for in a company before investing
I've been trying to think of the same thing as I slowly build a larger and larger position. I've found nothing compelling.
Not boeings problem?  Engine isn't made by boeing.. calls
I never consistently made money until selling covered calls on meme stocks, AMD PLTR NIO have made me so much in premiums and only a few times have even been exercised

Boeing is too important to US defense, so they can never actually fail. Everyone knows this. They get worse and worse as a company every year, and they've stuffed the FAA with their employees so they get away with it, but their stock will only go up over time because everyone knows we're stuck with them. You just have to wait for yet another inevitable incident with their shitty crackerjack plane, buy the dip, and roll in money when prices go up again.
Haha holy crap, i started watching your shit like a week ago cause i was looking for more gme info. Was super excited about the closing over 20 stream lol Merry Christmas and may we all get gains!
that plane has already gone through an insane number of ground checks before they ever took off. for them to take off means a lot has gone right.

Majored in finance at a state school in California. Started day trading again in March after losing 50k in 2016 playing options.

Actually did ok up until September 1st. Got a huge distribution payout from my startup company and threw it all into rh. On September 1st - 11th I blew 70% of my account on aapl and tsla calls. Value of my port went from 63k to <20k. From there I started yoloing in random things such as spce, amd, aal, docu, cvna, before taking a big drop down to 4K. I sat at 4K from October to November when I finally got a hot tip about solar. I dumped everything into CSIQ calls for December and January when it was around $38 per share. Earlier this week, CSIQ pumped around 20% thus rocketing my port back to a respectable 42k. Still need about 20k to get even but dude 63k>4k>42k is seriously the best Christmas present ever. 

Also I’m a degenerate gambler in general so this community is like family for me😛
We can act like the 737 Max didn’t have problems before that were supposed to be fixed 🙄
Aaaaaaaand it’s gone. The post is gone.
Eh, the biggest difference would be the net income. EV is and will always be bigger because you have to buy the car, maintenance costs, and the battery charger...need a new car? Rinse and repeat. With cybersecurity, you just have a recurring subscription with different tiers of security. Not everyone will buy into cybersecurity because if you're someone that prefers to live mostly off the grid, why would you waste money on that. Most of the money is gonna come from government contracts. If the cybersecurity can show corporations that they can do the same job for cheaper, then corporations will stop their own in-house security....that one is gonna be a hard sell
If you get into GME you're not playing for long term. This is a short play thats capitalizing on a potential short squeeze. That squeeze (most likely) will, or won't happen this April. PLTR is long term, GME were playing for a few months and then dumping it.
I applaud your patience. I hope they are truly interested and not another blind bear.

Call customer service for a refund
just desperate bulls chasing a stock after it ran up 700 percent who think it'll go up without a new catalyst and who don't realize the only reason it made it this point is via call option flows artificially juicing the stock which will now be massively hindered by the inclusion into the SP500 and the massive counter acting arbitrage forces as people sell TSLA volatility (the only thing allowing those call options to pump the stock) and long SP500 vol to close the spread.

Ya know, all that obvious stuff, not to mention the complete lack of regard for all the competition via china/apple/toyota/Volkswagen.

Yea but if you own the stock and say you sell to open a call and let’s say the stock rises to the strike price you get the premium and you get to collect the profits from the strike price. It’s a win win.  You don’t lose money. If it doesn’t hit the strike price you just pocket the money and you still have the stock to hold long.

Omg.  This stock is a bargain at these values.  China will be the largest consumer economy in 10 years. And baba is the largest consumer cyclical stock in the world.

Dont buy more than you can risk but consider owning some shares.  Forward pe on baba is 20.  Would you rather own a forward pe of 80 with Amazon?

The best DD's put the main reasons to buy into bullet points and use as few words as possible. I find that my best trades take all of 30 seconds to see the value in.

Thanks for the DD mate!

/u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT dude I’m SO honored I got a special shout-out in your WSB story.  This was better than any Christmas gift I got - the undying love and appreciation from an Internet stranger who just happens to have an absolute hammer, and I may or may not have a crush on (not in a gay way, in a I’m jealous of your tendies way).  

I’ll have to think of a special story to wrap up your hell of a year 😘
Papa elon needs no news
I'm to retarded to answer that.
Something something that sounds like we have a cybersecurity problem not a nuclear problem. So cybersecuity companies should be booming as they are. Also UwUwUwU is debt free. And both administrations support nuclear (said both for the conspiracy theorists).

I saw all the TSLA, MSFT, and SPCE gains in January - February 

Bought my first options (all in 4 diff stocks) on February 18th. FEB FUCKING 18TH. The literal day before the beginning of the worst crash in decades. 

I could have had lotto timing with puts. 

I got margin called and couldn’t trade for like 3 weeks. Everything expired worthless and I finally fixed my account in like the end of March, missing easy money with puts on anything.

I started 3-4 weeks ago when a friend told me about NIO, PLTR & GME🚀🚀🚀. Since then I've been lurking on WSB everyday. Bought shares into GME between 15-17 with x5 leverage got destroyed when Q3 financial report dropped fuck Sherman lost about 30%. RC buys more shares so I decide to go all in between 17-18 and the next 2 days it blows up. I've recouped my losses and now up 2k profit thank you WSB retards I love you all. GME 885 shares 18.68.

What do you reckon will rocket on Monday?
Mine moved from an expiration of June to 1/15.
I started in October dipping my toes in with a bit of cash.  Then I rode the "YOLO $PLTR" train to my first +50% of initial investment.

Now I'm just watching obsessively for the next 🚀🚀🚀 so I can get over that $25k minimum PDT then I'll lose it all.

I think he should just quit with his balance and reevaluate his knowledge before getting back in. Something is fundamentally stupid with OP.
In some dark corner of the far-right internet, they’re probably saying this but unironically
Lol exact same. Get spread too thin on spreads on 15 different tickers, can’t accurately track or keep up with all of them because there are too many, lose quite a few but it doesn’t seem like a big deal because it wasn’t a big initial investment, etc. But realizing the losses add up and it’s just a bad strategy, I have to tone down the ADD and focus on the few plays I believe in and can closely follow. And as OP shows, I really don’t need to fuck with options in most situations. 

I just started actively trading in the summer, made money but would have been better off just holding SPY the whole time. I’m fine with it though, I justify it as “education”. Trying to hone in my strategy and have discipline for the new year. This has given me plenty to think about.
I keep a small portfolio in Robinhood, I could never consider keeping anything larger and certainly not 25k. Unless I wanted to  throw money away.  Barely any after hour or pre-market trading who does that
I still haven’t fucking figured it out and no one tells you. Idk how these retards develop such deep solidarity and secrecy over their secret tickers

**[Stuxnet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stuxnet)**

Stuxnet is a malicious computer worm, first uncovered in 2010, thought to have been in development since at least 2005. Stuxnet targets supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems and is believed to be responsible for causing substantial damage to the nuclear program of Iran. Although neither country has openly admitted responsibility, the worm is widely understood to be a cyberweapon built jointly by the United States and Israel in a collaborative effort known as the "Olympic Games".Stuxnet specifically targets programmable logic controllers (PLCs), which allow the automation of electromechanical processes such as those used to control machinery and industrial processes including gas centrifuges for separating nuclear material. Exploiting four zero-day flaws, Stuxnet functions by targeting machines using the Microsoft Windows operating system and networks, then seeking out Siemens Step7 software.

If you dont know you are definitely a boomer.
Now people in public can know you're retarded.
Maybe I’d look at it differently once it happened but if I were to 10x+ my entire account value I’m taking out 75% of it never to get invested back into options again. Maybe I’d miss out on multiplying those profits as well but I’d rather realize most of my gains and know that I come out ahead as opposed to risking an amount of money I never would’ve been okay with depositing to begin with
I wonder how hard he had to work for all that money he lost. I love how people post their losses here for people to call them idiots. I see losses here everyday so not only are people pathetic but they also refuse to learn from others mistakes.
Is there a way to filter everything except wsb?
The US isn’t going to move into nuclear, they know just how easy it is for others to fuck them up with just a hack, especially considering the solar winds hack.

There’s just too much risk in one place for them to be used wide scale, the ones in operation were built in part for testing not just for the energy. That’s why the uranium boom that’s been talked about for decades never happens

Started in July when my bro started jerking off to TSLA everyday, decided to put in some money and like a fucking dumbass I tried to time the market without any knowledge of the stock market or how it worked. Missed a gain of 50% and told myself I would never do it again. Then I worked the entire summer(I'm 17) and have been putting literally everything I have since August into TSLA, and ended up with 50% gain and sold it all. Now I'm trying to time the market again and I'm waiting for TSLA to dip below 600. Also I think I'll just copy the lord u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT and put everything in CRSR. What do you think?

The benefit of GameStop over steam is...when I get bored of a steam game I stop playing it.

When I get bored of a physical game I trade it in to gamestop for $20 store credit which probably only costs them $15 because of their margins and then they resell the game for $35 and net a huge profit.

For avid gamers who buy 10+ games a year...that’s a $200 differential. That’s not insignificant.

I think by end of 2021 nuclear is going back on a boom. More electric cars = need more energy. Technically Nuclear is clean energy. Also mines been closing due to covid so the price will eventually go up. Us legislation is out there to help USA nuclear. Also they started a partnership for REE. Also something something Vanadium.
I doubt that very much - but you already handled it in a poor manner and demonstrated you have no wish for anyone else to help you by estranging us all without even talking to anyone first. So cool, good luck with the leftovers, I am done arguing about it.

6/18 VSAT $35c.
Back in March, my mom overdosed due to all the stress going on. She had stolen medicine from a hospital, lost her job and license, got her vehicle repossessed and was a month away from the bank foreclosing the house me and her were living in. Her brain essentially turned off and I found her dead one morning due to all the antidepressants she had taken at the same time. 

A month later we discovered all that, and I finally decided that I should stop blowing through money like there were no tomorrow, and start being smarter. 

I moved in with my dad and started researching savings accounts(both parents were terrified of the stock market, and school never taught me the importance of investing). After discovering that savings account would earn me penny’s every year I found graham Stephen who was talking about robinhood. So I downloaded the app, and just kept hurling money at it(50% etf’s/50%”risky”) 

Now, by all accounts, I’m still poor, but that big kick in the pants that happened earlier has allowed to save and invest like I’m living to a thousand years old. Now, if something bad were to happen, I would have a decent amount to fall back on. I have also gotten my dad and 2 friends into it(I told them to stay away from options[sry]), and they’re also changing some of their spending habits and investing more.
Merry Christmas you brilliant animal.

Especially if I can't sell for three fucking days (cant daytrade yet). Otherwise it would sound much better. I've only been doing options for about a month and learned lessons that werent SUPER expensive thankfully. Just wiped out my profits by being greedy. It's difficult to lose ALL your money on option plays if you're not a smooth brained retard though. Fuck weeklies and plays far OTM.

Need one of you autists help in figuring out what this HDS merger entails for my options.....

I got notified by Robinhood yesterday that my options expiring in march got bumped up to Jan 15th exp due to "corporate action". It looks like merger is coming to a close:

https://www.nasdaqtrader.com/TraderNews.aspx?id=ECA2020-243

I'm sitting on straddles but mostly concerned what this means for my $55 puts. They are offering $56 per share, I'm guessing this will make the 55 puts worthless?

Also, unsure what this last trading date vs. suspension date is.

TL;DR - Are my options fucked
Well Texas is the only state that could easily secede as well, this is actually possible

The only way this makes sense is if large shorts have been demanding good terms and their helpful counterparts are feeling inclined to tell them to fuck off if there isn't something very favorable in it for them.

Beggers can't be choosers situation, but of course anyone dumb enough to make a huge short on anything in 2020 based only on "tHe VaLUaTioN" is dumb enough to demand a good deal trying to get out of it, too.

I hope not i got calls 😂
Not true. 

RH doesn't allow the sale of naked options. The percentage loss that is displayed is based off the premium.

For example, if one were to receive $500 credit for selling the put and the price of the put increases to $1500 it would show a 200% loss. The loss is then taken from the collateral you put up.

I like the idea of not selling covered calls often, but it might not be the worst idea to sell them after HUGE up days. Like the last two days when it cumulatively ran up 30%, you could gauge that the momentum kinda faded on christmas eve and sold some then. Thats what I did to squeeze out just that little bit of extra money

Sorry, but that's a myth. A common myth, but a myth nonetheless.

>Josephus wrote all of his surviving works after his establishment in Rome (c. 71 AD) under the patronage of the Flavian Emperor [Vespasian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vespasian). As is common with ancient texts, however, there are no surviving extant manuscripts of Josephus' works that can be dated before the 11th century, and the oldest of these are all Greek minuscules, copied by Christian monks.[\[3\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavonic_Josephus#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFeldmanHata1989431-3) (Jews did not preserve the writings of Josephus because they considered him to be a traitor.[\[4\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavonic_Josephus#cite_note-FOOTNOTEFlavius_JosephusLeemingOsinkinaLeeming200326-4)) Of the about 120 extant Greek manuscripts of Josephus, 33 predate the 14th century.[\[5\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slavonic_Josephus#cite_note-FOOTNOTEBaras1987369-5)

I started buying stocks in 1998. In 2016, I bought 21k shares of cgc. I thank Mr. Bruce Linton, the ceo of canopy, for making me a millionaire in 2018. Those were funtimes in r/weedstocks where there were a number of guys holding 20k to 50k shares of cgc posting in the chatroom about weedstocks and  yachts. It was a crazy exciting time back in those days knowing we were to become millionaires.

Lately, just been in tech stocks. I'm looking forward to getting into usa weedstocks when the time is right. I think it will get crazy and exciting when that happens.

Why not? It makes sense. Find someone who owns a large amount of GME shares and make a deal:

Why wouldn't you be interested in a deal like that ? Instant 50% profit with no risk.

I thought I was going to be fine simply watching this from the sidelines. I’ve been loving following the wsb news on GME. But shit I might have to get in on the hype on Monday.
Merry Christmas you beautiful people
Terrorist attack plan and simple. Torture would be an insufficient remedy.

Thanks for this. It's posts like these that add the most value in my opinion. I can clearly see what you've done, what worked, what didn't and how I can apply the learnings to my trading. Really appreciate the post.
Yup, the difference in the quality of posts before and after he left speaks volumes to the importance of having mods that care about their community and not just becoming the most popular sub reddit.
I was able to get volume discount from TD, I’m pretty new to IB so not sure what their policies are

What happened?
Started trading in June with 3K, SPACs only. Over the course of the next 6 months, I put in a few thousand from my check( most of my check) each month for a total of 20k year to date. Port is now at 46k with a bunch of strong positions built low. Next year is gonna be huge for me now I that I have some money to actually play with

Haha thanks I’m not sure if that’s sarcasm or not, I have actual boomer style investment acct with responsible moves but my rObInHoOd acct is for turning 870 bucks into a $17,000 two seater airplane within 1 year. Either I pull it off or not but so far I’m way ahead of schedule.

sir you have to leave
Yo if you ever need someone to just talk with, don't hesitate. I know people say that all the time on here, but seriously don't hesitate. I know what it's like to be down and beaten in life, still do, so I get it man. Like I said tho, one day at a time. We got this.
Y’all are actually fucked. Hope you lose all your money trading and become homeless and people ONLY offer you water bottles
When will trump tweet something about jack “alien head” ma

It would make sense, since in the last YT livestream, Roaring Kitty kept mentioning GME being a "5-bagger" now at $20. Well well well, check out that $4 price point in photo ($4x5=$20). Well goddamned played indeed.

“You’ll get a fill then price will run away from you if there’s no immediate volume in the option that you traded.“

Which is why you want to only trade ones with volume and moving in the direction of your trade
Personally, I would close half and leave 2 open to capture near term upside of *potential* 500K delivery achievement. But need to confirm date of annoucment or ballpark the date.  

Elon has been giddy lately on Twitter, I think he achieved 500K, which bodes well for 2021 guidance. Everybody's risk tolerance is different, so weigh them "options." Remember you still win when you close with *any* profit
Up obviously, STONKS go
Robinhood line chart posts with at best a text paragraph of "positions" in the comments

After a minute I felt something warm and realized that you pissed yourself. I pushed you away and that’s when you ran but I wish you had stayed. You peed on me but it’s OK!

I’m not saying anything against him. I’m saying he wasn’t a trailblazer in the GME movement like DeepValue. One was a leader the other a follower waaayyyy later. When it’s all said and done and tales are told of MOASS he will not be remembered as an OG if at all.

he has cash for it. Also, his account doesn't allow options or margin.
Amazing, congratulations
Because of boomers on FB? Lol
They would float the idea that they can close their positions without having someone go on the open market in order to shake the confidence of people waiting for a squeeze. The price falls, they can get out. Classic example of “short, then distort”. They need to create fear, uncertainty and doubt.
I’ll be the judge of that
The people on this sub right now truly find this place as their source of comfort. I haven't seen this place this quiet in a verrryyyyyyyyyyy long time.

Mango lost. That is all.
He lost way more than this when GME dropped after earnings. $90k ain't shit.

Edit: him selling because of $90k would be like you selling your 10 shares of GME after they lose 90 cents.
You should show her your technique then.

its this sub in a nutsheel. will go all in on GME calls ased on "dd". but will ask someone what color is a blue sky.
Couple questions for you Lord Jack a Lot:

1. I see you started out on RH playing options and fd's before transferring to TD, do you recommend someone with a smaller account (>$10k) use options to get to a respectable amount or would you still just go all in on shares if you had to start from day 1 with $10g's. 
2. How do you manage FOMO from others making huge gains with options? It seems like you go into these trades with pretty high conviction so I'm curious why you don't leverage your returns considering how well your picks have worked out so far.
3. Love your DD's and updates, merry Christmas!
Since it’s Christmas we can shill trash right?!?!

I probably don't need to know the answer as I will find a way to fuck up my account doing this. I'm still curious anyway.
Im going in on BABA come next week. Most likely a play for earnings in February. I highly doubt ARK would start buying this if it was going to dip any further. They know its a great entry. It might take till the new year to rebound but it will rebound.

I see posts like yours every month.

This adds nothing to the sub's quality. In fact it's an oxymoron for you to complain about an influx of "low quality posts", because this post blows harder than your mom on a Sunday night.

> My strategy is going all-in on a single stock all-shares.

Sir, this is an options trading forum.

What is one standard deviation beyond your average holding period? If you buy slightly OTM calls with an expiration date that far out, you'd be up way more (even after accounting for taking a smaller position to balance out the additional risk).

> Haha you're going to owe so much in taxes - Nope, this is all in my 401k which in the US means I don't owe taxes until I withdraw. Fucking compounding gains for years bitch

I seriously hope this is all in a Roth account. There's no benefit to contributing tax deferred if the marginal tax rate at your retirement income is at or above your marginal tax rate at your working income.

Just pay all the taxes you can on your initial capital as soon as you can and get them out of the way.

Roll it all out into an IRA and climb up that Roth conversion ladder.

> having $200k+ gains without the ability to share was just not the same

Never trust anyone sharing gains. There's a reason why loss porn is so popular here.
I mean it sounds like why they invented the wash rule, but its on a different security because its not the same strike.

It absolutely seems like a cheat code, which is why it either is illegal or absolutely the dumbest loophole which is why I'm curious

Fuck gyna and their companies. Not investing in enemy anything anymore.
Options is not way to make money. Even if price stays the same, it depends on what bidders want to pay. They will sell it to you when premium is high and soon as you buy mfkas are bidding lower. Those who figured out this shit are selling premiums at high and buying lower. Much easier for timing to buy low and sell higher
I know this is off topic, but with all these hints papa Elon is telling us where to get rich next. Digital money. The crap about converting the Tesla balance sheet, money on Mars, the dog in the Tesla shirts. He can’t say it, but he is guiding us the way again.

they watch the book then blitz up and down and pop the stop loss guys.. set it way back if you're scared and put an alert for yourself for timing otherwise you'll get sniped...  -watch the l2 and trade with the Ax (google it) once Ax starts doing weird shit cut yourself loose and go buy other shit.
I think they took all that kind of stuff down.  My missed connection never messaged me.  I kept posting:

You’re literally answering your own questions. If sellers are winning, then sell covered calls or spreads.. If you can predict volatility then you should absolutely be crushing it with VIX plays, and if you think options are a waste of time, go talk to thetagang..
So, you're retiring right?

Yep.  Basically, the winning leg would give me a huge amount of short term gains in 2021, and the losing leg would give me much less to offset.  Basically just pushes my taxes off a year
Analysis and knowing a terminology are 2 different things. I don't know FX to talk about it. Buy options for hedging. Buying options to be rich. Hell NO. Buying options is straight gambling on my life.

That is craftmanship at its finest!
anyone else also in HS? learning trading for an economics class.
Started with 50k 2.5 years ago. I was technically profitable from the beginning, as I was very conservative (just buy and hold stocks).

Once the March crash hit I started day trading and was the least profitable times for my accoun - sometimes resulting in big losses e.g. 20k in a day.

I eventually stopped day trading and WSB style YOLO'ing and switched to the old buy and hold stocks and selling options premium and became much more profitable than before. I'm up 35% YTD - not much by WSB standards, but accounting for the March crash when I lost 50% of the account I'm pretty thankful for it.

Thats the plan all along, to turn us all Chinese.
Started In 2012 by opening a Roth IRA and putting $500 into vanguard each month. By 2013 realized vanguard was kinda gay and started trading stocks at scottrade.

2017: made enough money to buy a house. After I withdrew the money for the house I blew up the rest of my account on xiv.

2018: inherited a little money (10k nothing crazy) and went all In on tech in the Christmas crash.

2020: all the stuff I bought in 2018 (sq roku shop) went to fucking Pluto. My parents saw how much I made and asked me to do their money. Learned how to do options so I could do covered calls for their retirement. Trade debit spreads on Tesla and other high iv stocks for myself. Lifetime stock gains almost 500k

Lessons learned: 1. Avoid earnings except on long term holds 2. Only take trades that have good risk reward 3. Get conservative after big runs (the past month for example.) 4. Buy and holding tech stocks has the best returns but is also way harder than it looks (sq going from 100-35 then to 240 this year.)
Look I love the thrill of options and and am a sucker for how addicting it can get even though they can crush you, but this guys right about only buying shares... I wasted a year trading options to win some lose some and overall make negative progress. I turned to only buying shares splitting my portfolio between 1-2 of our beautiful meme stocks and started making much more substantial gains. Anyway nice job sir jack a lot, thanks for the tendie pic and your story. Merry Christmas retard

Market: “yes, we are looking beyond this to see the recovery”
Oof, well still can't really do anything until Monday, regardless you're aiming to minimize your losses at this point because there was really no chance for profit going into the trade at the strike and expiration you bought.

Its better to miss out than buying way out of the money options cause they will blow up your account real fast.

I make more money selling options than buying. I had four positions open. I bought ITM calls on BTG and FSM. I closed FSM for a profit already. I’m down in BTG but I have till April. I also sold two OTM covered calls on NGT and AG. NGT call is expiring in April but I’m already ITM in it. AG is almost ITM and expiring on Jan 15th. Time decay will help me render that option worthless, AG one. I love selling covered calls. I get paid for holding stocks. I don’t buy option blindly. I buy ITM options with high delta and relatively low implied volatility. I sell OTM options with low delta and high volatility. This is how I trade options.

I started trading (actively and with options this time last year). I positioned perfectly for the drop and my account went from 25k to 128k in a month and a half. I bet against the Fed and went from 128k down to 30k by mid-May. I’ve since bounced between 20k and 65k 3x and am current sitting at 38k. 2 weeks ago I worked up to 71k and had a panic attack and went from 70k to 17k in 5 days. I’ve had many sleepless nights.

I’m hoping to buy a house in the spring.
Yes been working for me. It looks like there is a lot of buying in pre marke/opening session and then it tanks.
Merry Christmas tards
No.  but becuase of the underlyings price, contracts like 5% OTM are like $30.  So if the price moves up a few percent, and i sold like 100 spreads, i could realize like 200k+ in losses on one leg this year and push the gains off until next year

I am currently selling Apple covered calls.  See you on the options chain.
All my friends were trading and one said about wallstreetbets, “it’s legal insider trading”. Then he started explaining options to me and I said, “you’d have to be retarded to get puts”. This was a couple weeks before the covid crash. Well guess what, I went all in puts at 218 and diamond handed them to 99% loss. Then I started again in September and now my account is essentially flat. Make some then lose it the next day. It’s exciting though and I think I have a gambling problem but oh well. I have nothing else to look for and this the only sub that makes me laugh and feel good.

I yoloed 59k into PSTH yesterday. Read an article 2 min later stating waste of money bc has 11 months left to make deal and may take a long time. Sold 1 min later for 1 cent loss. Didn’t feel like keeping 50k in a high yield savings account that is PSTH for 11 months

Typical FUD. IBs aren’t interested in performing the purchase themselves in exchange for other securities. This makes no sense. To close out a short position a share needs to be bought from the market, you can’t just “provide a value of a share” to an IB, etc. That isn’t how short positions are closed. The IB wants no part in ownership of a short position in GME. People are going to keep spreading rumors like this trying to soften the impact when shorts have to buy

You are a legend sir. 

Reading thru this has convinced me something I already kind of knew to be true...trying to “diversify” when your goal is to generate crazy returns fast is the stupidest shit you can do. Diversification is a tool for wealth maintenance not lambo farming. If you’re comfortable with the risk, just make the fucking plays you have done your legit DD on and don’t let yourself be held back by market average. This is why I’m up 600% on my Roth in the last 5-6 months with only 50-60% actually invested while I’m only up 200% on my cash brokerage in the last year fully invested with between 50-100% in margin at any given time. The Roth has less money in it so I’m not as much of a trepidatious bitch with my plays and I only go in on the shit I’m really confident about.

Appreciate you writing this out and providing the detailed receipts. Inspiring as fuck bro.

Okay so you’re front running the market makers. Great. You do realize the market makers update their bid/ask without seeing a fill, right? Unless you’re adding automated delta hedging in the underlying stock into your script, then this is useless. 

Market makers algos are set to change the NBBO of the option contract based on movement in the underlying stock, not price action of the option contract. They don’t need to see a fill in the option contract to update the NBBO. Their algos take care of that for them. You’ll get a fill then price will run away from you if there’s no immediate volume in the option that you traded. 

The primary way a market maker functions is by delta hedging, which you have not included in your script. If you do decide to include it, then you need to have massive amounts of capital dedicated to the hedge, not to mention a much more complicated algo. Judging by the fact that you’re trying to sell this for $40, I’m guessing you don’t have that. Additionally, you’re limited to 390 fills per day otherwise robinhood shuts you down. Don’t waste your time...
I started trading last holiday season, stocks mostly. I am at a 49.4 % ROI so far this year. I held weed stocks over the summer and sold right after the election when people were still pumped. I also caught the first pump of QS and rode that up I was in with shares at like 37. I got out mid 40's, ah well. After a trade is over it's over and I either took profit or loss. I just shove it out of my mind. One could go nuts over if this if that. I am a working dude, not rich at all. I have been hitting the books and have learned a TON over the last year regarding the market and because I am a layman I had to really start at the beginning. Interestingly I think I am starting to develop a feel for things, some would say your gut but I think all gut is, is the whole of your knowledge as a gestalt pushing in one direction or another. I have had it in other areas like music or computers or cars. If you really start to know something you can feel when it's off. I think in a few years I could be much better. I am aware that these are crazy times so I will have to learn all over again when things are more stabilized 15% is not bad for an ROI, anything after that is gravy. I made more this year on stocks than in the last five with my RRSP. (Canadian retirement savings plan)

Idk man, I still think GME is vastly underestimated.
There's probably a hybrid way to do this then. You could go in with a good chunk of shares on whatever he buys, then also do a few options that aren't too far OTM. That way you're not risking as much by going just options, but you're also getting more than you would if you just did shares. Because most of us just aren't gonna put everything into a single share.
Wait is that true
Just want to say you and /u/deepfuckingvalue are saving Christmas for a lot of people, not just with money.

I don't know how exactly this one will unfold. Every squeeze is different. I got into this stock as a long term investment, not because of short squeeze potential. 

You can study TSLA and OSTK. Both had some level of short squeeze in the past. In Tesla's case, the main theme is long term growth. Squeeze is just sideshow. 

I went long TSLA in 2012, at that time it was one of the most shorted stocks. I knew shorts were wrong. After 10X in 2013\~2014, many people thought it's a squeeze, urging others to sell at $280. It did pullback to $140 later. I didn't sell because I knew it was very undervalued. Now it's at $3300 (pre-split). A rare 100X, still a lot more to come in the next decade. 

If Ryan stays with GME, I think long term growth potential is very high. It's not a 100% sure thing, but I'm willing to stay as long as he is committed. Ryan is a very capable person, I trust him.

If the stock triples someone wants to sell 1/3 to get his money back, I'm not against that approach. Let the profit stay in the stock for another few years. I will keep all my shares because I didn't get enough in the first place.
Great point about defined amount of loss. I’ll margin some safe etfs and only yolo options with my own money. Feel like options give you more upside as well than normal stocks with margin.
So essentially the guy who tweeted this wants to generate more interest/momentum in short squeeze and made up some fiction. I don’t blame him but it hurts more than it helps as retail becomes jumpy

“Low risk” is questionable, but no they won’t. There are several reasons. Banks are highly regulated by the Feds, so they can’t just do whatever the fuck they want. Advisory is also a money printing business. M&A, LevFin, ECM, etc are literally risk free or the banks. They don’t put money to work but charge a % of proceeds. For example if you raise $900MM for a refi, the lead arranger can make 1-3% of underwriting/arrangement fee fee dependent on the execution. Think IBs as real estate brokers where they literally make money by selling your house (company in this case) without putting their own money to work.

Ok I don't want to sound like a jerkoff here, but this  isn't a good plan, it's a plan which is better than most but it's setting yourself up for failure.  So you've got 4K in buying power, rule one playing without margins with a 4K balance is a way to have your margin called in the middle of a trade.  Good or bad.  I would also stay away from any tool that is highly leveraged options and futures will wipe out 4K quickly.   The other issue is, to try to make $100 day, that's 2.5% your total account.  You didn't mention if your goal was to use that $100 as income or build your account.  Trying to set a goal at 2.5% a day is going to lead you into trades that may not be ideal but chasing a number.  You may get lucky some days but to consistently hit 2.5% a day, everyday, for 250 days isn't going to happen.  You can be a great trader but that's not going to happen.  A more realistic goal would be .5% which is $20/day, which will still be hard to do consistently.  The second issue will be is with such a small balance you will be tempted to throw 4K in and out of a trade.   The issue there is that with one bad trade you can lose 20% of your entire account.  Which means to make $100/day now you need to be hitting 3 and an 8th a day.   I mentioned trading on Margin with a low balance but the reason it's dangerous is because you can buy in on margin, and with minimal equity they can call you and sell your position when ever they want, which may be on a negative side.  

I think your goals are unrealistic, I would suggest  using your capital on more secure long positions. BABA is a good long buy (in my opinion) right now.  Trying to build up your capital is going to be key, you need to be able to afford to lose, and you can't.   To put thing into perspective, I try to average $500/day.  But that's not daily, just avg.  I usually only trade 2/3 days a week and some positions I will hold for a few days.  For me to hit that my goal is .52%.  Depending on the play my stops will be adjusted.  The thing is if I take a 2k loss ( and it happens) that's 2% of my trading capitol not 50%.  I'm not flexing here. There are guys here who will go all in on a position, and some of their stuff plays out.  But if you're looking for consistent day trading you'll need to 1.have a plan and stick to it 2.you need to get some more capitol to work with.  It's not exciting, it's not a YOLO, but it's where you need to be if those are your goals.  And in the spirit of WSB. $4,000?!? YOLO PLTR you fucking retard!
You're potentially right in the short term. But i see something unusual in QS. PFE will supply the world with vacinnes, but MNRA is making all the stock gains. 

I see the behavior of QS to be analogous to MRNA. Battery suppliers that produce will lag like Pfizer. Its the technology that trades.

Your mindset is two dimensional and safe. Look for a lower entry point for QS or just buy more PLTR. This is more of a why it's happenning discussion.

You can sell before it's ITM. Sell a couple contracts on the way up.

What a fucking legend.
No one has ever been in something like this. Just set a personal price target and exit at that point.

Another good option is exiting in intervals, sell a couple shares when you hit the pt, sell more if it goes up 1$, the more if it goes up 1$ again, and so on and so on.

Set limit losses and stuff like that too

Do you mean the hate on the comment you replied to or the hate on OP for selling GME? cause:

Hate on OP for selling GME is banter.

Hate on the dude you replied to is cause he is responding seriously to my meme comment.

\+ OP stated himself he sold GME at 15 meaning he missed out on another 33% gains.
I sold a few of those
52 week low was ~$2.5

Approximately 9x or 8x if you'd have bought the dip back in March. 5x if bought most of the first half of this year.
Saturn and Jupiter are intersecting at the 12th moon so it should be around January.

My magic 8 ball says around Jun 

My dog shit on the 12 day of August on the newspaper cut out I laid out for him.


Taking all that into account and averaging it out it should be around Sept.
You must be more sophisticated than me.  As far as I know, you can either sell the option if it's ITM or exercise it.  I don't know how to trim profits from an "option."  I would be interested to know.  Please explain, if you don't mind.

Very true, but I always feel the need to point to people that more will lose then win when you’re trying to replicate this madness.

The high schooler that bought weekly puts on SPY multiple times and each time 5x or more his account balance?  That’s how I found this place.  How many people have blown up their money trying to time a weekly SPY jump/dive?

Then you had FB puts guy.

Or TSLA call guy.

Most of the big “this is how I found WSB” was someone seeing a top gains post on “all”.

Granted most of those turn out to be people posting fake/shopped gains, but it doesn’t stop people from coming out of the woodwork.

Though Ir0nyman and GUH did a decent job too...

I’m not making a point, anyone who uses this sub for more than a jumping off point to do research needs a reality check and I wish them all well.
How do I invest through my 401k? I’m paying some bonkers taxes.
First time edging in WSB? It’s a good read

WOW. Thanks for the link.

Stop sending money to the Communists who are running concentration camps with 10 million people in then *right this very minute*. Communist China is just as bad as Nazi Germany; concentration camps filled with religious minority, forced organ harvesting of millions of Falun Gong practitioners, violent annexation and murder of foreign people (Tibet). 

Send money to Communist China and wake up with a Gay Bear on your bed while you experience sleep-paralysis.

Yo retards. I've done some DD as how to recover from my idiotic moves and here is what I came up with. Rate it from 0 to autist approved:

1. Gonna keep my 2 dividend stocks long time (20% of my portfolio)

PFE (I know its a boomer stock, but Q2 from all that vax sales should be awesome)

MSFT (good entry and basically a safe bay)

2. ETF (30%)

ARKK and ARKW

3. SPAC (20%)

BTF 
PSTH

4. Meme Stonk (20%)

GME (x5 laverage for the incoming squeeze)

5. Leave  10% for a laveraged long for Nasdaq and SPY dips. Buy on red days. Sell on green ones. Only longs cause I can hold it till recovery if it keeps dipping. 

Any suggestions? Want to complete this asap on Monday and just ride the wave.

I see your issue here. You think you're investing in 1968. It's not 1968, boomer.

Look at the five year performance of Altria -- people find it, and its employees, atrocious and want nothing to do with it. 

Shit man, when even investment funds have more caring for others than you do then you are doing life wrong. But at least you can wrap your sociopathic mind around the fact that if investment funds care about people, and they are divesting because they DO give a shit, then that hurts you financially.

A list of pre-split SPAC’s? Not sure, I just keep an eye out for SPAC announcements from pages like [SPAC Track](https://twitter.com/spactrack?s=21).

A list of real brokers? Any of the 5/5’s on [NerdWallet’s List](https://www.nerdwallet.com/best/investing/online-brokers-for-stock-trading) are pretty good.
Real answer it depends on your goals for real estate. If you want to own a place to live and stay in it for a while, interest rates are extraordinarily low and you can purchase property with a very reasonable monthly payment and 30 year cost.

If you are planning to flip the property in the next couple years, you could easily be sailing into troubled waters, and should treat it as a risky venture. Absolute prices could drop quite a bit.

Yo is this serious. FWIW HIV ain’t all that bad nowadays.
I'm not saying to buy here, but $100 looks like the new floor. I'm in at $30, so the bag won't be mine for sure. I'm just brainstorming the rationale for the valuation.

Tesla shares should not trade at these levels based on book value style logic. I don't even think you are doing that, just guessing the top and doing TA retracements.  If you don't even do this, you are a lazy critic.

Bag holders (few at the moment) vs No holders = 100% nothing holders. Risky asf I know, but why is the market doing this? There's more, the technology is real.
Just working. U?

Lmao please post gameplay of the Tendie PC
I mean it would be pretty risky but id sell cash secured puts on moderately high IV companies - you can get a 10%+ premium which would make your goal amount. If you get assigned switch to covered calls. Picking the right stock would be important, but yeah doable. As your balance increases you can decrease your risk accordingly.

If you’re going into Pharma, I’d go for LLY, ABBV, BMS, JNJ for long term growth and dividends (ABBV). If you’re investing in Big Pharma, invest in the companies, the pipelines, the biologics, the acquisitions, their strategies— don’t blindly go into them because covid vaccines won’t play a large role in the stock price.

Is it too late to go all in to GME on shares?
it takes a little more time but you can make serious gains with stocks, you should focus on % weekly/monthly gain. it’ll compound much better than linear growth and much less stressful looking at it as “100/day”
Sorry I didn’t see this until now, man. I honestly hate working for them and plan on quitting in the next couple of months. Some people love it, but I did 5 years in the Marine Corps and got out because I didn’t like the environment, now the place where I work is implementing more and more policies and starting to feel like the military more and more. But I work on one of the programs tied to the military, so if you work in a different area of the company, then your experience will probably be very different.

Quick edit: The amount of time we get off is the tits, and the paycheck is also pretty tits, but whenever we’re at work, it’s not the tits at all.
So the thing no one seems to be discussing is.... like, what happens when "the squeeze is on". Do I just ride the wave as far as im willing to risk and get sell? I'm fairly new to investing and never have done ANYTHING like this before, I bought 200 shares at 6.85 just hoping they could rebound a bit and I could take a 20% profit after capital gains lol. I feel like I'm in over my head at this point

>But Ryan Cohen, the former CEO of Chewy, thinks the maligned video-fame retailer can turn itself around by shifting its focus away from physical stores in favor of a building robust e-commerce platform. Cohen thinks GameStop can use its brand and large customer base to make that transition. He has taken a large stake in the company to try and push it in that direction.

Using physical stores to buy back used gaming merchandise is proven and works. If they can then sell this used shit online, they can get a higher price for them and sell them faster, because there will be more demand online than whoever strolls over from Starbucks.

This would increase their margins and make each store more profitable and eventually, they could buy games back for even more money and shake their shit reputation. Hopefully the money is GameStop credit instead of cash.

I can see where this works for the current business, but I think they need to do more than that. Otherwise, they're just a [http://poshmark.com/](http://poshmark.com/) which has a valuation of around $600million.

My story is I started trading back in late 2015 after I found robinhood. Few grand lost here and there. Took a break at 2017 after not much success. Basically trying to hit home runs, holding longer than I should have and mad fomoing. Dabbled in 2018 and 2019 didn’t learn anything. Wasn’t until the crash where I had a influx of cash March 2020, played a few options but mainly just bought stocks at the lows. Back in late March I was finally +% all time. Fast forward today I don’t have any stocks in robinhood but just playing the long game on AAPL and small leaps on cruise lines about 25k total. up 120% this year and about 90% all time. My 5 year goal is just Apple. Suppose I can retire in 5 years if all goes well, sell my house and move to Thailand for 10 years and continue while my portfolio grows, while reducing COL by like 40-50%. Come back to America and maybe setup shop in Vegas (I love playing craps) Options is just play money for me, I don’t spend much. I probably throw 30% of my income into retirement accounts.
I’m Kohler.

People buying shares a) aren’t turning $30k into $1 million in a year b) the type of people that will see this type of post and think “hot damn this could be me” and not really my target audience.

Besides I promise there are people that have bought a stock at the absolute ATH, using margin, and then got margin called within a week.  Sure not total lose but I would be willing to bet more than a few people here have lost more than half their account balance in a year and shares alone.
My Christmas gift to you guys that I bet no many know: 

Its possible for a stock's share price to fall below $0. The reason most people don't know this is because every brokerage will automatically sell your shares at $0 by default. You have to manually turn request they don't by editing your account they basically make you sign a contract saying asking if you're retarded.  After the share price drops below $0, Mr. Diamond hands is now responsible for a percentage of the companies debt which is calculated by the amount of shares being held. You do not want to take on any company’s debt by holding their shares below $0/share. I’ve seen countless bankruptcies and ruined credit scores after brave diamond hands held their shares to the depths of hell as they relentlessly tried take on the collection agencies. So if you like you a true diamond hands go ahead and turn that feature off at your brokerage. 💪🏻

There are so many finance market sites. Im not about reading a Bible worth of Info and financial statements unless I have a good lead.
Yeah man NYC changed so much after 9/11.. I’ve made a few visits but never moved because of everything you just said.

I’m in Albuquerque, New Mexico right now and love it. If you make 6 figures here you can live like a billionaire. Crime is bad but nothing you can’t stay away from with some brains. 

Head west my friend, anywhere around Colorado seems to be great. Maybe look around Utah? Thinking that’s my next move
Did he leave your sister develop a new interest in twinks and buttplugs?
If we are too lazy to do DD, we are too lazy to read your post. TSLA calls??

He is def one of my favorite producers. Also has a ton of really good educational content and sound packs out there if you like to produce as a hobby
So you want to make $36,500 a year trading stock and you think there is a simple roadmap to that? And if we don’t agree offer alternatives? You’re in the wrong place for constructive feedback. Fucking idiot.
I dream of one day posting something like this.  You gave me the best Christmas present a retard could ask for: motivation.
SOAC
Inflation isn't hitting
Volkswagen's CEO said that VW would strive to be #2.

Not even kidding.
Going all in on a couple of stocks I love (honestly, PayPal, Apple, Microsoft because I’m a boomer cunt) sounds brilliant. Also genuinely well done man, great story! Make sure you write some memoirs so your great-great-grandchildren know they have chad dna.
Options prices don’t care about margin rates. They are Rho sensitive to the risk free rate. Options have the benefit of implied leverage while being risk defined. Never assume undefined risk if you tap into margin.
i can only hope my ass can be such level of retard

Lmao those pussies only beating by 12% WITH all the insider info. I’m out here yoloing like a retard and beat market by 300%
DM me I’ll take your action
Seriously amazing story. People underestimate what you can do with just stocks alone in this environment. Don't want to harp back to those dark times, but how'd you end up owing 120k in taxes? Did you sell when you were up 300k? And then buy back in afterwards?

Asking because I'd be interested in trying out your approach by going all in on just a few stocks that I've got strong conviction for, but won't be doing this in an after tax account.
Ouch feeling that with BABA right now atleast my call is out to 2023....

Hey dont hate the player hate the game i love big cocks btw
sir this WSB... 100/day is for pussies. +1k OR -1k per day if you real. get yo ass over to boggleheads or whatever they’re called!!

but in all seriousness, you’re better off buying/holding good companies in 10-50bil market cap, they’re large enough to grow fast but not small enough to be a “pump n dump.” if you wanna trade options, stick to 2-3months out. keep in mind after weekends and holidays, you don’t really have THAT much time on short dated contracts. don’t trade weeklies, that’s the true autist way
Nice math dude you belong here.
Thanks for the hilarious read. Luckily I don’t have 50k to yolo in anything. Sitting on a 30k portfolio spread so thin with highest being 10%
they didn’t even post how much money is in the account like?????

Behrs r fuk.
Started with $18k at 20 years old working as a line cook and going to community college as a philosophy major. Lost everything trading options. Invested my student loans and convinced my family to give me a small loan. I'm at $30k. I drop out of college. I wind up bagholding garbage weed penny stocks until I sell for a 50% loss. I go back to college. I trade to pay rent but never make a profit. Sell my car for $5500. Take out more student loans. Covid hits. I lose everything. I'm down to my last $1.9k. I don't leave my apartment for days. Shutdowns happen. I sit outside every evening to have a few beers and watch the sunset. I'm not depressed but I'm angry at myself. I don't remember what exactly set me off, but one evening I just got up, grabbed myself by the kohonas, and decided that I would start all over again for the umpteenth time. I swing trade travel and oil stocks for $25-$100 every day for months. My account starts getting bigger, so I'm making $100-$250 days now. I wake up at 3am and go to bed at 11pm everyday researching, planning, and watching my trades. I discover FUBO at $21. My account moons. I'm now making $300-$600 every day. I swing trade PLTR every day and my account moons again. 

I'm 24 years old now and my account is sitting at $85k. I've made back everything I've ever lost and then some and average around $2.6k a day. I'm also going to into my last year of college as a Finance major. 

As much as it hurts to watch dozens of WSBgods be born in this market, I realized that I don't have to make $1m overnight to be satisfied. The trick for me from the beginning was to avoid trying to hit those home runs and just take profit. Even if you're still confident in the trade. Also, play the trend. Don't try to be a top ticker. Lastly, have yourself with a couple of beers every now and then. For me, it helps my mind reset and evaluate my trading philosophy. 

We're all going to make it.
100 x 250 = 25,000. 
Also I have an automatic deposit of $150 a month.
That’s what happens when you do retarded weeklies
Wow man.. the KFConsole is real?! I made enough gains this year to justify it. I'm fucking in.

Normally I’d agree, but I’m pretty diversified in SPAC’s, and I bought them at a pretty low cost basis. I’ve sold a lot of them for cash, so if they all went tits up is at worst be at maybe 14k (I don’t have any options lol)
I always raw dog it. Married or not
If you short stocks you deal with the consequences. Seeing the shorts get burnt with tesla this year was great, now the same must happen with gamestop.

Someone needs to make this Christmas card
Take a look into the future:

Musk creates "X" in 2023 that becomes a parent company to SpaceX, Tesla, Neuralink, Boring, Starlink, etc. FSD taxi services is separated from Tesla to become its own subunit and, with their 20 cent a mile rate which is cheaper than car ownership, is conservatively valued at $100 billion in 2025.. Tesla shareholders vote overwhelmingly to amalgamate into this holding company.

The Apple Car is introduced in 2024 which causes a pullback in Tesla (X) stock, however uptake of the Apple Car is more limited than expected due to suspension issues and soft steering due to the spherical maglev tires. At $1000 a tire and a price point of over $100,000 a car many people opt not to buy an Apple Car. Tesla stock (X) not only rebounds, but with the establishment of Starlink connections to the upcoming Mars base, and the bandwidth expansions, adoption even in cities increases. X becomes what Alphabet never could: the world's first $10 trillion dollar company.
Yooo I felt the same way when I bought mine with Fastly tendies back in august

Shares are the long term way lol

Options although can provide those fast gains off less money.. also provide fast instant losses lol

i'm not trying to be fucking r investing but there's a reason why diversification is a thing.  everybody's a fucking genius in a bull run, and he could have just easily came in here and been 50% down on those picks.  50x in a year is straight lotto ticket and the mean will eventually get to you.  blahblahlah i like chicken nuggets.

So sad Robinhood is keeping me from joining the fun :/
so with your 7k account you want to make 250 (approximately the number of trading days in a year) x 100 = 25,000???? without adding any money, if your account somehow made it to 10,000 by this time next year that would be reasonable.

I think 100$ dollars a day isent doable. You’re going to force your self to bet more on losing days. I would shoot for 300$ a week. It won’t effect you as much emotionally. Or at least it doesn’t for me. More time to work with and less pressure.

Edit: maybe even a monthly goal of 1k

Started March of this year, at first with around 1k, and slowly adding more as months went on. Around October I was getting laid off so I pulled my 401k out with the COVID relief clause to avoid penalties, and added another 25k to my trading account. I've been profitable from the start, but took a very slow and steady approach early on. Very Buffet style, but realized I wasn't going to make any large amount of money starting with such a small portfolio size. Been doing swings and dabbled in options since then, and im up ~60% for the year.

I actually have a couple of UUP call options but expiring in Jan, was supposed to be a short term trade based on TA and price did what I expected it to do but it happened in the middle of the night and dumped by market open. First time trading UUP so wanted to see how it acts, had less than $20 in it.

You're in a great spot even if you just do something boring, like put it all in VTI. If you can put $1K in a week, you'd be at $1mil in around 10 years if you get the average 7-8% market return. 

I know the WSB philosophy is to yolo and try for $1mil next month, but it's nice to have some money doing boring stuff while you also make some risky options bets.

Where did he say his dad was bragging about his investing prowess? His dad is bragging that he gained money in the markets. CFO uncle should be proud himself or ashamed because he got outperformed by some dweeb gambler.

"You are up 60% this year?? You should be ashamed of yourself, you should've had losses or moderate gains at best because you didn't go to school and training like me. Then I'd be so proud" 

Fucking losers I swear

This'll do
What would happen if a couple million people did this? Would the spreads in play all move to 1 cent? I’ll be honest this is way over my head, NBBO?
I’m literally in the exact same boat. 30 shares @ $275 cost basis. Started averaging down from $290 because I thought the ANT IPO drama would blow over. All I know now is that I’m not panic selling in the middle of this BS. 💎🙌
So basically join thinkorswim
There should be a cash prize to the winner so that more people will join! Retarded plays, retarded gains!

I'd say it's actually kind of hard to do that in a bull market with only shares unless you just fomo into every stock at ath's. Options will burn you really quick though.
Yeah rec me some

I joined wallstreetbets in December of last year. I was trying to learn as much as I could about the stock market before I received an inheritance of 21 pre split AAPL shares that were worth about 7k at the time. I opened up my E*TRADE account in January, deposited $1,000 and started trading in February. I was able to double my money by trading TMUS calls before their merger with sprint. I was so excited about my first big gain. After I had 2k in my account I received the inheritance, which brought my account value up to 9k. Late February volatility brought my account value down to 7k and then I started buying puts and straddles. My account went from 7k to 15k in March and I withdrew 8k. This accounted for my initial investment plus my inheritance plus 1k in profits. 

I didn’t touch the my account again until about July. Since I bought LEAPS close to the bottom of the crash, my account was up to 10k. After dropping from 7k- 5k. I traded through august and until September 2nd and was able to make my account value 25k from tech calls. I of course didn’t sell and got dropped back down to 15k in September. This fall was very volatile and I bounced around from 23k to 14k. This month I hit 20k again and withdrew 2k into my bank account and put 1k into an IRA. I’m up 1,053% YTD. 

That’s my story.
Salty as a bag of chips
Lol bro I’m 36k in the hole and another 5k lose in unrealize gains
Winning answer.
CCP Isn’t above launching an investigation to force share price down and buy it themselves or allow friends to buy it.  I’d say it’s a buy status next Monday.
Nicest thing about being married is fucking raw whenever I want lol
I only see 60k in. Also why would you post this after making 25% gain and not when you went in.
Cheap thrills

Robinhood doesn’t list units (IPOF/U for example), so there is a period before the share-warrant split that Robinhood traders can’t buy IPOF. In all fairness to Robinhood I don’t think WeBull lists units either. Neither platform is built to handle warrants.

I personally use TOS, but any of the real brokers would work.
Depends on where you live I guess. My sons are dead and washed out. Thanks to people not on this sub. So, shit goes both ways!
Ironically my Robinhood DOB is May 15th as well but alas, I'm only down 19%.

This is it. Mama Woods is gonna cause this shit to rocket back up if she buys more.
So, u just posted a whole mainstream video without changing anything and get 12 awards. The retardness is strong in this sub.
No.  The U.S. is the only country in the world that practices extra-territorial taxation of citizens.  The only way out is to give up citizenship.  Oh, but U.S. citizenship is so valuable that you owe taxes for 10 years after being a citizen for any amount of time.

IRS always gets theirs.

Cool story.
I don’t that’s how it works. You have to pay tax on gains even if you lose them

Not easy to do - if he exercises he needs the cash to buy the underlying shares for the 2,000 options expiring in January (so 200k shares). At an average cost of $20 a share, he would need $4 million in cash in his account to exercise these.

Good discussion here. Thanks for weighing in - please continue doing so on this. You too U/DavidNexus7 - thank you for sharing your expertise here.
Wow way to get defensive man lol. I was just being nice. Fuck you too. Also, you were spot on wrong about your entire thesis, so you clearly suck at this whole investing thing, so maybe you should stop giving advise to people and stfu

Dabbled in day trading. Did decent, but wanted to trade more. So opened a cash margin less account and fired off 30 trades. Cleared my account..

Made sure to learn from that lol my trades are night and day. Starting to get the hang of finding big plays. Now I'm learning how to improve my entry so I don't miss out on so many. Been in a couple but exited way too soon.

A wise man told me, as long as you learn, that money is an investment in your knowledge even if you are in the red.
You're completely ignoring the context of his message. His dad is bragging about his "investment prowess" to his uncle who is a CFO. Based on the OP mentioning his uncle is a CFO, we can infer some things like his uncle would be disappointed he's gambling in the stock market instead of making informed investment decisions. To his uncle, investing probably isn't gambling or a game. You fucking retard.
Jesus never had monetary gains on this level, although he does know how to gain followers!
Someone stop me from a YOLO at this price.  Give me an out that the shorts could take to save their skin and burn a few more retail investors.
If you gamble on stocks your wife likes she won’t get mad. Example Starbucks.
My favorite thing is to buy units before Robinhood can list them, then sell them back out for a 10-20% gain because retail crowd bids the SPAC shares higher. If the acquisition is a good deal you can always come in with warrants.
Such a psychopath lmao
Because nobody is seeing a white Christmas irl so the oil industry is trying to show you a simulated one to keep you from noticing how the world is collapsing

Always wanted to, finally had the time to learn thanks to being unemployed for awhile due to the pandemic.

First trade was 80c August expy CHGG at the peak in June, diamond hands for a month for 60% loss, sold right before the run in august. The first one was not free lol

Yolo’d everything on Apple calls on the split announcement and turned 5k into 25k. Now it’s like 35k primarily trading CCL/JPM/DIS/ICLN
Didn't think about that. It probably was a mobile meth lab

All I see is GME 🚀🚀
Most of the shares I have I bought with other calls I sold, so I do owe taxes. I'll sell a bit soon to close out 30k margin (bought a tesla), pay taxes and for another house.

This makes sense, but then the amount of SI here is massively bigger than other cases so who knows right?
I lost 68k in March and was up +10k in August. Then lost 50k in September. You can be in the negative this year easily if you bought calls in March and hold it till September.
They've historically issued more stock than they repurchased. Last year they issued 13B$ in shares at 180$/share. Ever wonder why they hoard cash and make outside investments rather than aggressively buy back their own stock? Now you know :)

I started in October last year with $PCG being my first stock. In hindsight that was a retarded place to start investing cause it was off the back of their bankruptcy filings and my only reasoning was CA wasn't gonna let them fall. Needless to say I bought the dip all the way down to $5 and cashed out at around $17. Didn't discover options (and by extension this sub) until MSFT 200C 3/20 became a meme

Mean reversion is a thing. 

Lots of loss porn in the future.
You don't have to actively manage covered calls. It takes me like 10 mins every morning to set my positions. But less active would be leaps I guess. You probably want to just buy stock man tbh, but if you want to gamble i guess just buy leaps.

I have the advantage of being on the west coast so o do it at 6 30 every day. Im not sure what I'd do if I was east. Probably just buy stock and occasional puts to hedge.

I have never had high income, but have managed to max my Roth since my early 20s (mid 30s now). I just bought a boring target date fund in it, but it's returned 10%+ on avg. A couple years ago, I also started getting a 3% IRA match at work. So, with those alone, we're on track for a modest retirement. 

This year, with daycare shut down, I suddenly had a bunch of extra money and decided to open a taxable account. It's mostly VTI, SPY, and UPRO, but I have been doing some meme stock trades for fun. Overall, up about 20% this year, and starting to play options a bit more. 

This year has encouraged me to save more and be more aggressive about investing. But, I have to limit the really wild bets - got a family to take care of.

When you have current unrealized gains with any kind of realized offsetting position or hedge it becomes more complicated: https://www.optionstaxguy.com/straddles

During the last few months I have been actively taking on more offsetting positions specifically to reduce my short term liability for the year but I’m only now just realizing the irs is really picky about which of those they allow you to actually claim as a loss and which ones they force you to carry with the unrealized gain position

Shut up and let the man work you autistic imbecile. Also, merry xmas!
Started in March during quarantine because I was stuck at home and knew everything in the market was on sale. I always knew I would do this but this put the fire under my ass to get started. I’m AD military so never really had much time to focus on investments. Started 100k in march now around half a mil. Making big moves next year
It’s a bad move for high stakes options trading but dude can make bank with thetagang
It's you! Merry Christmas!
Not even in the right season 😭😭😭
Past data would suggest this going up at the end of year and beginning of the year.

It’s been discussed as nauseum but the answer is they’re closing the unprofitable location to stop the bleeding, keeping the locations that print. Online sales are small but growing, and of course the née console cycle will boost revenues. 

EPS is negative still but growing and they smashed estimates last quarter. Soon as it turns positive the stock is worth a lot more

Every ticker requires different maintenance and maintenance requirements on individual tickers can fluctuate as your broker evaluates risk. As you trade that won’t stay constant.

But assuming it does and you have 100k today with a 30% maintenance and you put 30k on margin if your 100k goes to 0 you no longer have the 30% to cover your margin and you are facing a $30k margin call.

Now it’s unlikely that 100k will go to 0 unless you yolo on otm nkla options. But that is the max risk scenario.

Now if you want to keep posting here you need to max out your margin on otm PLTR weeklies. Otherwise stick to the comment section or r/stocks.
We’re headed to 🔥HELL🔥 here! Bear party!!!

You belong here friend!
Your dick is short.
You can justify inflated valuations on a company not making money when it has 30% CAGR. GME has had negative CAGR for years. It’s literally dying by the day.
Sick until u turn 2k into 150k
Ok Wokemere, the projection is breathtaking.  Maybe we can agree whomever did this, right, left, or foreign, they find them fast.
Ouch, yeah that completely went over my head. My thought was to primarily trade spacs so my comment still stands but damn yeah I’m a dumbass lol. My bad.

Edit: and to be fair, I wrote this while I was laying in bed this morning hardly awake hah
i think the major hole in the short squeeze thesis is that we assume that long stock holders are not going to sell on the way up to the apex of the spike.  There are a lot of individual, paper-hands, retail-types who are going to sell at 30 and 40 etc, which means that shorts are going to be bailed out at every leg up.

I'm long 5k shares, and I would love for this squeeze to get squoze, but the epic short squeezes of the past had massive single-equity-holder interest that I'm not seeing in GME (RC's stake ain't gonna cut it)
Just regular e-commerce. Tripled revenue tho

80% of this sub are new to the market and this sub. The people making real money on GME have been long for a year and have a lot of experience. We will see a massive amount of loss this year, followed by a mass exodus “blaming wsb”.

I also lie for a living so disregard this entire message.
I’d say it depends on what that money represents for you.

If you’re making $30k/yr at your job, and have $10k saved, then maybe the right thing to do is to leave it all in your trading account until you hit some milestone.

If you’re making $500/wk from trading and that could have a big impact on your life, take some of it out and pay your bills and loans.

My advice is more “don’t leave everything in your active trading account”. Take some gains off the table for fun, taxes, and longer term ETF investing that you’ll buy and hold forever for diversification.

MT has went flat but looking at the chart that looks normal. I'm just happy to not have been in baba. If you think MT being flat with all signs looking good is bad, imagine being in baba. It's just gme and pltr this week making anything but 100% gains look bad.

Not a bad person necessarily (though I’m leaning “yes” on you) but that’s a pretty tone deaf thing to say when people are losing loved ones and jobs and everything in between if they find themselves on the unlucky side of this thing. Glad you’re on the lucky side but remember: all of our luck can change in an instant and you’re not immune to disaster or hurt or pain even if you feel great right now. A little humility is in order.

Lmaooooooo, imagine a gift card where you can only buy weekly options.

😂

Kinda would be like a lotto ticket
How so? They’d have to boom so hard to make the amount of time necessary for growth worth it. I bought in at 21 and sold at 33, but I’m also fuckin poor so that was only 10 shares. I can’t see them hitting 40 within a year- which in that time frame the money I could invest in them could grow so much more elsewhere.

I’m genuinely curious cause I had my dad buy in on PLTR and told him to sell when I did but he didn’t. Wondering how long it’ll take for his investment to pay off and why PLTR would have a spike like that if their biggest involvement so far (the vaccine) is now in the end phases

It wont matter when you go to do your taxes all they will ask you for is profit minus loss from all your brokerage accounts. So you if you had more losses overall you wont pay anything and you gained more that you lost you’ll pay that difference.

$STIC was a SPAC trade dumbass
Taxes are never a reason to incur a loss. They can be a reason to realize a loss, but not to incur one.

But the flesh lights are inverted
True, but now I’m hearing a host of sports stars, chefs, movie actors are all on the verge of starting SPACs.  I’m not sure how a celebrity chef can raise a billion $$$s that fast, but who knows?

Maybe there is some nano sized SPACs you can get listed on an exchange.

I’m really stunned that the major brokerage houses let you trade some pretty shady stocks.  Not like the old days. They would not even list them. 

Today’s it’s just the Wild West.  I’m ok with that. I got the Google.  :-)

Merry Christmas, you autists! Thanks for introducing me a way to both be less productive at work and to lose money. I hope I don't lose my job, I especially need it now.
*The SEC wants to know your location*
There's always a buyer for ITM contracts. There may not be much value attached to them in terms of time but they still hold real value in terms of contracts. Not like someone is going to sell a contract worth $500 profit per share for $400. It just won't happen (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MARKET ORDER MORONS), otherwise I'd put low bids on literally every contract out there.

Personally if I had unlimited funds and some way to make it happen I'd put out 5 cent bids on every contract out there in existence that are worth at least like... 50 cents ITM and just see if any fill. Literally instant and free money.

It's the same kind of concept of buying every single lottery ticket combination because one of them will win the jackpot, PLUS you win the other sub jackpot prizes too.

Not traditional PE. Don’t think GME is a take-private candidate. More of a special situation/distressed shop kinda play, but I agree it’ll likely not be equities but some sort of debt. I don’t work with public equities so not sure how plausible the options laid out are but they don’t make sense to me either.
What's shameful about winning? I should be ashamed of my losses maybe but like you said it's just gambling, it's a game
2.5k upvotes for someone reposting a bad joke and complaining about how many upvotes they got. What has this sub come to?
I mean when you have a guy that turned $20k into $12m who owes you $4m, you probably give him a "small loan" of another $1m in hopes of getting the rest of the money back.  It isn't like he crawled out of a $4m hole with the money he made working the cash register at Wendy's, he got someone to bankroll him.

Except for the fact that the department of homeland security and the FBI have ranked white supremacist terrorism as the highest threat level to our country, while Islam is below even black separatists who barely exist? How about the fact that almost every terror attack on the US within the last 4 years has been perpetrated by radical alt right white supremacists?

Started out trading in early Feb this year. Fucked around with options and lost on pretty much every single trade, but was having fun. 'rona happened, and went balls deep on puts, which I kept rolling forward, on about every ticker you could imagine. Bought LULU and Spy puts at the bottom (was up 10000$ on the lulu puts in an hour but dIaMoNd HaNdS bRo), bagheld these till expiry and had officially blown up my RH account (went from 16k to 100k to 0$). Switched to etrade, started learning more about options, using them less, not following wsb dd posts and coming up with my own ideas. Ground my way back up from -16k ytd, now sitting on 64k realized gains in etrade, and only -4200 on RH, hit my years goal of having over 100k Net worth (which at the age of 18 is pretty good).

There’s been a ton of companies that go bankrupt within a few years of zero debt and some cash. Most clothing retailers are run with little debt, but they still go bankrupt once they fall out of fashion and start losing money. I guess GME bulls don’t understand companies need to make money.
Damn, You do 1.5 or 2 minutes???

I didn’t buy PLTR shares because of rocket memes. I invested as a long term play because I believe they have significant growth potential. Also, institutions are adding shares weekly. if you’re trying to suggest that they’re all dumping, that’s just not true.
Why ashamed

How do you not understand margin but you are well off financially?

You would never want RH to be the bank on this trade. They will randomly margin call your ass and your portfolio will be locked up on an expiry day.

You are correct, if a PE firm was buying GME it would be in anticipation of a takeover or major Refi and it would likely be Debt not Equity. HF’s are def never doing Option 1, I work in finance and have literally never heard of anyone ever consider doing this. This is like liquidation crisis level scenerio and the fund would likely go under. Option 2 is unlikely also, there is no private auction, the PM would just call sales reps at all major banks and see what they could negotiate. (IE: is there any Larger stakeholders they work with willing to sell a large block and maybe PM pays a little premium to buy off them in a negotiated sale), they would then cover the short position by delivering those shares to their CP’s.

Exactly. If someone is willing to give you money, take it, Regardless of the situation. Figure out the rest later. In this case, dont take margin and yolo it all on one option that expires in 2 days, but using margin for a LEAP is smart. Barring the world ending it can't go tits up.

Pls help
When the market crashed in March, I played it wrong.  It wasn't until the beginning of this month that I finally got my account balance back to it's pre-crash level.
I started March 23,literally the bottom.

Unfortunately I wanted to get my feet wet, so it took until August until I got all my money in, 115k. I'm an odd situation, in that I have six figures by fortunate circumstance but otherwise I'm making 40k with 3 kids and a not working wife finishing school.

Regatdless, despite taking so long to dump my money in, I'm up 86%total, Friday slipped me back down to 99k for the year in profits. Which is insane.
Excellent rundown sir! You mention doing all of this research, could you explain to an aspiring young degenerate how you conduct said research? What tools/sites do you use? 

Like how do you find customer sentiment so quickly? How did you learn how to interpret charts? How tf do you feel confident about identifying a support level for a stock?

FUCKING LEAVE ROBINHOOD.  Everybody AND THEIR MOTHERS DO IT NOW!!!

Fuck their service is horrid. I used to use them but as soon as I doubled up to a comfy 50k. Got the fuck out.

They’re great for beginners and actually quite good at not scaring you off from learning basic things in the stock market like options basics. But Jesus Christ, if you don’t today, eventually you’ll get fucked, and they won’t take any responsibility.


There’s a reason why they have mad extras security at their building in Cali. Numerous people get burned, and robinhood cucks them. Then they’re left with only one option, going to the office in person to get to the bottom of their bullshit.

Based on an study from Alphacution. They found RH gets 18k per avg dollar in a RH account from investment banks that pay to have your data to front run you compared to 500 or so for an Ameritrade, ETRADE situation.


Do yourselves a favor and find a better more reliable broker.

TD you can chat with someone almost any time of the day. Had a very pleasant conversation with a rep at 1AM est. He actually got things done for me and we were laughing together about things like we were buddies. That’s customer service.


In short, FUCK ROBINHOOD if you’re not just starting out or a beginner looking for a solid base and understanding with an account 30k or less.

Please, all these repetitive warnings on here are not just there because people are bored. When everyone says the same thing, there’s gotta be some merit behind it.

And yes, I very much believe those power outtage days are their huge money making days when everything conveniently does not work.

IPO coming up, something tells me it’s not gonna go through. Good luck being transparent to your customers how much money exactly you make on their backs.


Also, no broker is perfect. And at the end of the day you have to take responsibility foe yourself. So don’t just blindly blame RH if your dumbass lost money on bad plays.

Been trading since Oct 2018 and have been losing paycheck after paycheck. Sometimes my account will go as high as 15k to 20k but then I get complacent and lose it all. Most of the times I got wiped out, it was because I went all in on a bet I believed in and got fucked. Total loss must be at 80k, have 2k in my account now.  
Now, I'm trying not to bet more than 25% of my account on any single stock, so hopefully that fixes things.
Just open an account with another brokerage and you’re golden.
People have not "been masking" for months in the states.  One of your top two presidential candidates was holding rallies where most attendees didn't wear masks.  Armed men had a plan to kidnap the Michigan governor over her social distancing policies.  You guys could be doing much much better.

I'd say now you can afford a legitimate online account, but since most brokers offer free online accounts, I'll say you now have enough to lose that you may want a brokerage whose site doesn't crash every time volume is high.
That's how I felt about last month
The vaccine is effective against it. The hope is that the public will worry about it and stay cautious to continue preventing the spread. More airports are closing and banning flights from UK. Seems like a reaction
My first real trade was in 2007 when I was 21. I put about $4000 in apple after the iPhone was announced. I held for a few months and realized a $400 loss. I sold and decided to just spend the money on something else. 
In 2015 I switched jobs and had about 10k in an ira. Put it mostly in amzn, and appl. Each year I made about 20% but kept withdrawing my gains. 
In January of this year I got laid off. Still had about 12k from my previous IRA so I did a 60 day rollover in February and bought puts on the market. Realized about 25k in profit and put the money I used (10k) back in my ira. Been unemployed about 11 months and had to use that 25k. 
Added about 58k from my former 401k to my ira making my total ira around 70k. Withdrew an additional 6k to help me get by. Didnt have any money in the market after the March crash until recently as I didnt want to risk losing anything while unemployed. 
Started working in December and have had my money in the market for the past month. Back up to 70k. I mostly track a top performing fund, TFOIX.
Yes that is correct, I double checked the tax code right after we got the check. But the money was for my wife and her siblings so I just have my name on the check cuz we share the savings account it’s going into.

Great post. Doing the same missionary style in a Roth IRA; shares and occasional covered calls. I notice I’m ripping when I’m all-in on a single thesis and I’m moving roughly sideways when in 3+ plays. Diversification is for passive investors that cannot/will not do broad DD.
My only hope is lots of options open for a 50 strike by December 31st. So if nio tanks even more at least I'm not alone in being broke.

I got into the stock market back in mid 2019 but all I did was invest in dividend stocks. In December when I looked at my all time chart I had made about 7 bucks. Now I was subscribed to WSB for awhile because I had seen some funny memes and gains over the years and thought that was cool to see on my homepage every once in awhile. Then in Dec 2019 I decided I would figure out how they make so many gainz and discovered options. I had never known such an amazing concept existed so I got to researching everything I can on options on WSB and YouTube that whole month. I made a New Years Resolution that I was gonna start with $500 and start options trading on January 1st 2020 and make 100% return. Made some great trades on SPCE, MSFT, and SPY, I won some and lost some. Got $1150 on a TSLA trade back in Feb in about 5 min. Got my first 1000% on TLT the day the Fed announced the emergency rate cut in March with a few calls bought at .20 that turned into 10.00 in just a few days. Although I did lose a shit ton when the market dropped hard because I was in a lot of positions like, MSFT I still had cash to make some smaller plays which kept me from going under. Decided to cash out some of the money to build myself a gaming pc since it seemed to pandemic was going to last awhile and took a break from trading the last 3 months. Overall I made 10k since January so more than my new years resolution. 

At first i thought I was unlucky starting out options in 2020 but you know what they say, "hardship builds character." And if this was my first time trading options and still made a ton of profit (and I thought I was playing super conservatively too) then I can't wait until we get to the next bull market run to really rake in some cash. So thank you WSB for showing me the light in a tunnel I believed to be no light at all.

Yes, Google has an established history of starting up projects and discontinuing them at random. The main point I was making is that shifting into a new market is not easy, even with all the money. 

The Roku vs. AppleTV is not about making money on the hardware. Roku doesn’t make any money there. Those things are sold at cost. Amazon is in that space too. That business is about capturing cord cutters and getting all the streaming app. Roku has an App Store with the usual percentage fee. Also, it’s about ads and getting a cut on that. It’s basically becoming the main content aggregator. Apple lost out on that and they pioneered the AppStore concept, apps, developer support, etc. 

Anyways, we’ll have to wait and see as the EV market evolves. It sure is attracting a lot of big companies. Everybody is seeing something in there.

Sell covered calls 🌈⭐
Up 800 percent this year. Finally at 100k feels good
Started late July with 5k, played around the 5-6k range for a while. Mostly long plays on recovery stocks that I planned to leave there until next year. ICLN, MGM, DIS, C

Went to 6k during august, down to 4.5 or 4.7 on September, put 1.5k more on calls for MGM and JETS. By then my portfolio was DIS, ICLN, MGM, NCLH, JETS, JPM. All stocks except mgm and Jets which I had stocks and calls.

Mainly doing theta plays to add some sauce, when vaccine was confirmed jumped from 8k to 13k.

Got into ARKK and had 4k in cash that I was planning to save just in case, then I saw the GME DD, put 2k on GME before earnings which went to hell.

Who cares, the arguments were solid, bought the dip all the way down to 13.

Now I’m sitting at 17.2k with GME, DIS, MGM, ICLN, ARKK, JETS, NCLH, JPM, BRKB

All stocks, I’ve been thinking on getting a couple GME calls
Ghey
Bro. Come on. One good 30k yolo and you can be done.

> GME is a financially healthy company

How do you figure? They haven’t turned a profit since 2017 and have had steadily declining revenues every year for the last decade. The only way they have been able to stay cash flow positive has been through investing and financing activities. Operating cash flows have been negative for years. The balance sheet isn’t in great shape either. Book equity is about half of what it was a year ago, and it’s going to turn to negative equity if they have a 1-2 more years of operations similar to 2020.  I really don’t understand how this dying brick and mortar dinosaur which absolutely will be extinct within 5 years has somehow become the wsb meme de jour. I understand that it’s a short squeeze play but that has nothing to do with the underlying fundamentals of the company’s financials, which are a train wreck. This is NOT a financially healthy business. Buying this equity is a completely speculative play on the hope of a possible short squeeze.

that is the plan for the new year, figuring if I can afford to be dumping over 1k a week into options I could still be making decent gains just being more patient with swing trading or long holding stocks.  Wouldn't have to look at my phone every 10 minutes either.

I read that there were people having a Christmas party on the 30th floor and a blue collar NYPD cop named John McLane dropped the terrorists’ c4 ignition charges down an elevator shaft to foil their plan
How miserable a person do you have to be to be in here downvoting posts on Christmas. Holy shit man.
Bombing in Nashville? Awesome I need to fly there soon. Maybe airfare will get even cheaper
Uh, all the backwards stuff you post
Merry Christmas you fucking autists!  May Santa bring us all tendies and if you’re struggling with the holidays just remember it’s only 55 hours until we’ll be screaming at each other in all caps about little red & green numbers and the world will make sense again.
Then let it play out and not point fingers.  Tons of cameras in downtown Nashville.  They will know soon who it was.
It would moon every year
Thanks for this, I'll check it out!
Because chwy specializes in the pet products and works directly with suppliers to meet the final mile distribution needs.

I speculate that they also meet up directly with the suppliers of the food itself - slaughterhouses that leave you the big pile of pink guts that makes “lamb” dog food, which is the “animal feed” division of many slaughterhouses / agriculture companies. 


I don’t disagree that in general there is a lot of opportunity to relocate Amazon by abusing some of their “management bandwidth” by not being the best at a specialized set of products without devotion to that set, and CHWY is a good example.

But I do question how GME is going to do this with an industry that has “developers -> publishers-> market places -> consumers”.

They basically need to align themselves with publishers to receive and distribute content to consumers that’s already available online. And in 10 years I don’t see the actual distribution being physical at all anymore with hard drive sizes and internet speeds only going up. 

I’ll admit I know nothing about the finer details of the distribution channels here. But from a high level it seems like the publishers just need a market place (like steam, Sony, msft) and GameStop wants to insert themselves into that space. Maybe through an app on the consoles or something. 

As a consumer I’m all for price options and competition. And GameStop has always had competitive prices, it’s often why I would buy games from them. The physical copies were often cheaper than the digital.

I highly doubt we’ll ever see a secondary digital market. That’s something I don’t think anyone upstream will allow to happen, and they are the ones holding those chips. 

The other big move would be like a “steam” for consoles. It’s hard to see that happening but maybe it would allow indie devs to break into the console space if the marketplace existed?



I will say that the deal itself sounded more like Microsoft just trying to obtain the GameStop loyal fanbase and customer lists by throwing their already scaled technology at the storefronts, and giving them an edge at in store advertising. 
GameStop is great and gamers love going there because of the people, but I don’t think they love buying there, and that whole deal sounded nothing like what I described above. To me, it feels like a big pump and dump.
This is a fantasy, but achievable levels of fantasy! More power to you.  


BTW, any superior retard out there who can teach me to invest in Wall street while I sit here on my shitty arse in India?
I just reached the 5x on Christmas Eve.

&#x200B;

 2k -> 10k roughly

&#x200B;

In 30 years with boomer returns this'll be 50k, 100k is easily achievable... But yeah honestly fuck that. 5k of that is either going to approach 0 or 1,000,000

I was curious about the same. Of course, who knows?
I'm waiting. The news was overtaken by pooh bear coming down on baba but the other news was that baba and others were being used by the ccp to analyze stolen data from American companies.

Hell yeah, similar situation it sounds like. I’m 25 tho lol. Merry Christmas

I am drunk right now, and I just realized that my year has actually not been that bad. I was thinking I am going with the typical loss game as other loser retard here, but then I remembered that I kept withdrawing smaller amounts of money after every race to the moon. So the total is actually +50% this year. I spent all that money on guns and ammo though. Not sure what I will do with taxes, haha.
Probably do just a little research and you’ll find somebody took out a newspaper advertisement a week ago saying this was going to happen.  Hint, wasn’t a white trump supporter.

And for me it's only $500k. I don't need millions.
Started with a Fidelity minor’s acct since 16, made some nice gains. (13k-21k-34k eoy 2019) Rode TSLA up on there almost exclusively, going in and out. 18 year old on RH rn, trading  both options (mostly ATM or slightly ITM 30-45 days out) and stocks since Mid-august. Up 38.6% from then after being down nearly 80% to 13k. The comeback has taken the form over consistent 3-5% days back to back to back. Currently sitting on 88k in RH and a few grand in savings (lol).

So blessed to interact with you guys, you really mean a lot to me. Since that 7x reversal, I feel another solid run and I could maybe get myself a Tesla Model Y this year, maybe even a lambo if I’m really disciplined and lucky by eoy 2021.

Thanks for everything and Merry Christmas!

It makes no difference to me. I use enough synthetics and other collateral heavy methods that I haven't paid a cent of interest in months.

I tell you use that leverage. Use it to buy options expiring years in the future on big ETFs. It's not the instant gains this sub obsesses over, but it offers the best risk/reward tradeoff you'll find anywhere.
Yeah I heard, . Ya stay safe as well
Nope, you sound like a great person to me. 

2020 has been the best year of my life, hands down. Not only did I begin throwing large amounts of money at the stonk market but I also discovered WSB. Life has never been the same again. 

I won big and lost big but somehow found a way to make it all back and print mad tendies (thanks PLTR). Like you said, as long as the market is lit, then I'm extremely happy.

I have two very different sides of the story, started with a Stash account September 2019, that has 5K in personal and 2K in either IRA is 62% YTD. I do not sell and buy that often there, maybe once a month. I have another 6K in Merrill since August and was doing very well until about a month ago (37% up) just trading stocks. I started playing with options a month ago and I'm down -12% YTD.  This is $ I allow myself to play and learn with, made some bad mistakes: sold JMIA 40c a day before expiration for a 40% loss and exploded the last day, was up 120% up on a SNOW put (first and only put) and got greedy and ended up selling for a 20% loss. It's been a very interesting experience, love the rollercoaster feeling of it.
If you’re old enough to remember trading in 2017 you know the real best year so far. Literally a 12 month endless bull run.. then the trade war..
Lol not how IB/PE works. PEs usually don’t buy public equities and IB usually are in for the advisory fees. Maybe merchant banks and asset management on behalf of institutional clients but not the IB itself. HFs are more likely to do this kind of stuff.

I heard about tesla and wanted to get in on the stock market because it was making people money. I made an account sometime in February and put in $1000. Unfortunely, I didn't just buy TSLA and hold but I learned options and did earning plays. Failed at each one, losing all my money in a week. Just for kicks, I put in $500 more. I was down, but didn't wanna be out. 

That 500 is now $6500. My best moments was hitting 6-7 earning plays correctly in a row, and writing DD on it, leading me to have a following of 3000+ WSBers here on reddit. Gay mods banned me tho, so I made a new account (this one) and quit posting DD. 

P.S. why are these random threads sticked? I thought the 2nd sticky was for DD posts.
I honestly believe anyone trying to pump a stock while institutional investors are selling off is a fucking idiot. Anyone that advocates for such is either has a self serving motive, a complete lack of basic understanding how markets work. Anyone whom follows this misinformation is a fool.

The only reason I could possibly see in the world  that isn’t just an accident is somehow they weren’t able to buy after hours and they wanted to hold shares over the weekend in case it jumped hard in the morning. Usually you can get an expiring contract executed after hours by your broker

Hey OP, I have absolutely no concern about RC bailing at this point, nor did I have any after he first got into GME. I feel like he's doing this in the honor of his father, and money of course. His fathers teachings is how RC was able to create Chewy with such an immense impact to the entire pet store industry, even beating Amazon at their own game. I think RC is highly committed at this point and will most likely turn this company around, run it for a few years and sell it once it turns into his vision.

You honestly think someone who doesn't understand delta, gamma, theta, IV, bid-ask spreads, etc. is "in the same position" as me? Maybe in the short term, but someone who has that knowledge makes better gains over time, knows how to scale their risk tolerance to their account, and won't loose that 100k on bad trades. Knowledge is absolutely necessary if you want to make this a living. Saying that it doesn't matter how much you know is such an ignorant outlook on how to trade and one of the reasons people on here lose so much money. For every 100k win there are thousands of losses. That's why consistently wins are important over a single YOLO.

I'm literally an idiot, not even joking - I'm new and seriously have no idea what I'm doing, but N G A already has a definitive agreement and merges in February. If N G A really is his play, I wonder what the catalyst would be that would drive N G A up. I also wonder why this catalyst isn't happening for a week or two, causing ComputerTE1996 to say he is waiting to post his DD because "Wsb retards have no patience \[and couldn't wait two weeks\]"

They still need a widget for the  watch face, but the application to check is in there with a couple steps/clicks on the watch.
Realized gains - realized losses. So 3000 - 3000 = 0. Not sure on the math tho.
The thing about fundamentals is that the only thing that actually matters is supply and demand for the stock.  A company could profit $100 billion a month and it wouldn’t matter unless a ton of people want to buy the stock.
True I agree with you, especially in the Mentality that we gain. But imagine one person that makes that 100k off of one trade. Is it hard? Ofc. But I don't think it's impossible. You don't need to make consistent gains. Yes it's great to understand options, but the guy who got lucky is in the same position as you. He won't need to do as many trades, or trades at all last that. And no I don't think anyone should chase it, but I think the YOLO is absolutely worth it. 

One of the other thing is don't buy weeklies. You can buy monthlies. And if the stock doesn't drop as much you can always sell early. No need to stay 💎✋

I feel like you can read and understand as much as you want. But the market can be irrational. Did we think Tesla was ever gonna get here. Fuck no. It's not even understandable. 

Just personally, I think it doesn't matter how much you know.
But... I would gladly repeat for their failing hearing. They act like I'm speaking incorrectly and don't acknowledge their own poor hearing ability. This has gone on for years and years. :(

You retards and those retards are literally falling for “DD” just like people do here.

It’s not exactly “wrong” but it’s incredibly misleading to say a VIE model has anything to do with the risk of investing in a Chinese company. It’s just using words someone doesn’t even understand to try to give their DD more weight.

Having ownership of profits vs ownership of “direct equity” doesn’t matter. That’s why the accounting rules consolidate companies under both VIE (variable interest) and VOE (voting interest) models. 

No, you don’t get a vote. Guess what. Your vote from your MSFT shares don’t matter either.

The reality is - “investing in any Chinese company is a fucking risk because China can literally imminent domain everything and say fuck you I can do what I want I’m the fucking CCP. I’m out here committing genocide and you people won’t do shit what you gonna do about me taking away your stonks?? Lmfao!”

**Thats** the risk with investing in Chinese stocks. 

The legal structure has nothing to do with the risk and the fact that it’s setup as a vie or vie doesn’t really matter. The risk is the CCP can take your shit away. End of story. Doesn’t give it any more creditability or make it a higher or lower risk based on some accounting terms the OP doesn’t even understand.

I personally don’t think this is a short term risk because the CCP will continue to allow funding and cash flow into Chinese companies to fund their growth without them before they snatch them up. It will happen all at once when the war begins, and when that happens, everyone’s fucked anyway. They’ll Zerg the world and the Zerg always wins.

Bro I’m balls deep in shares. I can definitely see a dip happening there are a lot of new people who got in recently
how else would you soar past something if not anally
That's correct. Sorry is that line in the DD?

Its 2/9 so every 9 commons is 2 shares, every 99 is 22, etc. 22% gain in position if you look at it in terms of shares (not intrinsic value)

EDIT: Thanks! I missed that typo in the DD although it is correctly stated in other parts. 2 warrants at $23 for every 9 commons you own. Beware the redemption right owned by the managers (explained near the top of the DD and in the S-1). Many will likely fall asleep at the wheel here and not redeem the warrants which would give them to management for pennies each. Don't be that person. Stay vigilant on the correspondence you receive once the LOI and merger happen! They have to give 30 days notice if they want to invoke the redemption clause! Good Luck!
It should hit ATH heading into the weekend of Nio day. Then gap up. Then it'll bleed off probably 20-25% for a month then go back to bull trading pattern

1. Start of movie: “You don’t know who you’re fucking with.”- Viggo (Then proceeds to have a few openings to kill John but doesn’t, including approaching his unconscious body) 2. Relationship between John and Marcus is cookie cutter “guys who act like friends cuz they both had dangerous jobs and worked together but anything can happen in this crazy world so they keep in touch. Also one wants to live a normal life and the other respects his wishes because.. cuz.” Marcus pretty much signed up to die by taking the contract with the intent of keeping John alive through various assassination attempts.. for reasons we’ll never know (they don’t tell us how close they are). John then comes across Marcus’ lifeless body and decides he’ll fight Viggo in hand to hand combat for Marcus’ sake? Idk there was some weird honor thing going on. Cool part is that John took the knife to his chest as a guaranteed win + narrative insight on how he sees himself toward the end of the movie (probably inspired by the convo he and Viggo have about them both being “cursed”). Well anyway the kid he’s tracking down is useless with no development. 90% of the other characters are “hey harry” “hi john” hey jimmy” “hey john” like bahaha he’s an assassin with relationships comparable to a normal fella. Lol. And we’re not going to discuss the cringe Femme Fatale who literally useless in the whole plot. MCU Black Widow knockoff gets fucked by bar guy for breaking rules in the bar that John breaks as well but John is friends with him too or whatever so it’s cool lol. Finally... the reason the movie exists: the combat. Martial arts looked good, however the actual positioning is not. At one point we see John wrestle a random goon for a whole minute without knowing how many other goons are in his house. No reason why he couldn’t have gotten domed during that minute by the dude who had to pee before entering. Same with the church scene. Walks in. Shoots pope guy. Aims up at one guy on upper deck. Proceeds to drag pope fella. Same thing applies here. John either has thermal vision or plot armor. The supposed Baba Yaga just has good luck. We’ve seen this in countless other movies. It’s a fine movie.. but not worth the hype.
Hey... at the end of the day he becomes rich with that fruit company.

For sure. I don't ever hold calls closer than 4 or 3 months to expiration when theta becomes even more of a bitch. I aim for holding 6 - 9 months to exp. It also always helps to use this tactic on blue chips, or a stock you're incredibly bullish on. For example, I'm not too worried about theta when holding some leaps on MSFT.

Now.. what I am worried about is a prolonged downturn. How you hedge against that.. well.. I have some ideas, none too great though

What broker this is
I started when I was 19 but robinhood back then didn’t even have options. I discovered the sub through the comment section on one of Shkreli’s live streams. I didn’t have a Reddit account but I would lurk and copy some plays here and there. Didn’t start options trading until I was 21 going into my senior year of college. That summer I doubled my internship money playing AMD calls. Then I bought TLRY calls and puts. I felt invincible and started listening to the sub more. I lost everything by October of my senior year playing PFDAs which is why I hate playing biotech/ pharma. 

I’m 25 now and still yolo like a degenerate occasionally but my Robinhood and TDA are all time green.

Lucky sure, but going big in shares on good stocks that are beaten down or yet to run has little risk. 95% of stocks will come back to your cost basis eventually. And you can sell covered calls on top of that in large quantities since you’ll prob have 1000+ shares. I put too much faith in options

Not sure what Cohen's specific vision is, but he's definitely staying at this point and isn't pumping this up. Since he now owns over 10% of the company he is officially an insider and cannot dump the stock whenever he wants (if he dumps the stock within 6 months of purchase, all of the profits he makes can be clawed back by the company and he won't get any of it).
Because SPACs are bubble city and no financial advisor should at all be advising about them.

A financial advisor is not an expert stock trader, they don't necessarily need to have a deep understand on options trading or the latest M&A/SPAC news to be of incredible value.

You all have to understand that batching into positions does wonders for you. Same as what jesse Livermore stood by.

I usually take a started position for like 30_40% of what I really want, and once the confirmation is made, I'll add into it, or sell my small starter if it tricks me and breaks down. Also, i tell quick gains into bigger non volatile stocks. For example i made 22% on Tesla,  I'm not going to go throw it into PLTR cuz PLTR shares the same volatility as TSLA. so, I'll buy walmart or some other less volatile stock so that even if shit tanks, it wont tank nearly as much which means I'm protecting my profit. I also learned to know my exits before any entry. Both profit and loss type exits. Things can change and news can alter the plan, but you need to have parameters before any position is started. That's genuine proactive risk management. 

So yeah just scale into or out of your positions, also make sure you considered the true downside risk for every play, have an exit or two in mind before your entry, and put hot money into cold money stocks.

Oh and again, I do not trade options.

To be honest I just browse this sub and watch people win and lose, don’t really dabble too much in options and when I do I usually lose, up 62% YTD.
Been messing with the market off an on since 2002.  My brother basically probably had some sort of a mental problem and he went full on degenerate and borrowed money on his credit cards to fund his trading accounts.... it didn't work out shocker... he actually had a good credit score too and was able to screw the banks for a good 100k plus.  So be careful with trading many people get too consumed and can go down a very dark path.  Got myself into a Amazon/eBay flipping business back in 2013 and that has made me more money than I ever though possible.  It also wasn't very time consuming so I got back into day trading in Oct 2018.   Broke even 2018 and small profit for 2019 but 2020 I am up over 200k now for the year.  Might not sound like much compared to sir jack me off but it isn't chump change.  And it also a gain not a loss which is the more typical result of day trading.  I am no expert on day trading but I have found stock selection is key to making money and trading when the odds are in your favor for your strategy. I focus on momentum and if I pick the wrong stocks I get chewed up.  Did that on Monday and Tuesday in tsla giving back over 20k to tsla after making 30k on Friday.  Luckily stopped fucking with tsla yesterday and traded baba on the news move for a 14k gain.  So now I'm only 10k off my ath for profits this year.  I would recommend new day traders start a lower risk business than try to get into trading for an income stream.   Having a big cushion has definitely helped me become a better trader than when I traded in my younger years with money I really could not afford to lose.  Back then if I made $500 that was huge now $500 is dick and I'm swinging thousands every day.
I bitched out in 2020. Held all my FAATMAN stocks that I picked up from 2016 on because stonks only go up. Had just moved across country in March and not sure if I was going to lose my job while basically broke. Kept my head down until I felt secure enough to play with stocks again but not smooth brained enough for option diamond hands this year 💎🙌. Missed PLUG, NIO, and the real JPlow printer money this year. 

Got in PLTR at $20 and then again at $31. Still up 260% YTD 🚀🚀🚀

Ah yes. I almost won it last year. It was a fierce competition. Be sure you guys dm the mods asking about it!

It falls under standard marginal tax because it's considered income. Top rate is 37%, at 518k and up. His highest tax bracket is probably 24% unless he's making 70k annually already.

Tax math is easy and you should definitely familiarize yourself with it before tax man wants his pound of ground and you don't have the money to pay him.

>Strange that alibaba does stock buybacks on a ticker that reddit declared worthless

Plot twist: They issued additional shares on the HK exchange to buy back shares on the NYSE. There was never a net repurchase of shares LOL
Hahaha oh geez disclaimer I’m a 25 year old pilot not a stonks ninja expert or whatever they’re called. pltr whooped major ass for me too, I had 16c and 17c that I sold at 600% and 1000%. I certainly wouldn’t sell all your shares if you haven’t already but for a 50,000k play maybe take a look at certara for shares. but if you’re looking for a degenerate play... I’d say icln calls at strike dated a month out but have your finger on the sell trigger if there’s even a HINT Biden ain’t gonna be prez. I’m up 186% on my 27c 1/15. Merry Christmas btw

Its definitely going to gap up the following Monday and from there ether it's gonna keep going up OR  a sell off with all the people only playing Nio day but Also though there a shit ton of calls that end the 15th that Friday so it could keep running up to that Thursday (14th)

Too much DD about it here already. Just search GME in wallstreet bets and look for it. Gamestop is not a 10 year play my man, its a next year play because of a possible turnaround due to Cohen and maybe short squeeze. Anything after that will be determined by how successful the turnaround is and only time and earnings reports will tell
Can’t you only put 19k in your 401k a year? Also you’re actually getting taxed more every time you withdrawal from it. I understand with the cares there’s no penalty but that ends this week. Not sure if they’re going to extend that portion of the bill because only 8% of people utilized it.
People? At this point it’s just one person. We don’t know what happened. Let’s wait and find out.

If you're legitimately open to advice, take a step back and stop trading options. It's not something you just jump into. Start doing a bunch of research and stop trading until you know what you're doing - here are some of my favorite resources that I read when I was learning how to trade.

- How to Make Money in Stocks by William O'Neil
- Mastering the Trade by John Carter
- Understanding Options by Michael Sincere
- Understanding Stocks by Michael Sincere
- Chat With Traders Podcast
- Option Alpha's Youtube Channel

Just dive into those. They give you other resources and references to check out. I studied charts, read countless books, learned trading platforms, watched videos, essentially treated trading like a second full time job before I started trading. I started with a $500 Robinhood account, grew that to $3,000 then opened at $10,000 account on TOS and consistently make between $800-$2,500/week. I primarily sell premium because it's lower risk and this is my only source of income now. If you want to make this a profitable lifestyle, it takes a lot of discipline and emotional detachment from your money/trading itself. That's just my 2 cents.

Not exactly. The $3k/year limit is only for offsetting ***earned income*** (eg. wages from a job).

You can apply up to ***100%*** of the amount carried over to future ***realized capital gains***. So for example if you had $50k in capital gains the next year, you could deduct all $30k from that, and only pay taxes on the remaining $20k in gains.

I started when a post hit the main page about 4 years ago. Obviously was attracted to big gainz. Using alt because lost my main account. I started reading and reading about options. Dove in and lost my ass three times. I now primarily use the wheel for my option trading. I like making the highest probably trades so most would consider my strategy boring. I just lost too much when I made speculative trades/bets. I will still throw flyers out there but they are small compared to main strategy. 

I also have a nice chunk in our gal Cathies hands but those are shares. All my really boring stuff sits in a Vanguard account; more Cathie there too. Again I don’t trade WSB way most of the time but I love coming here and joining in debauchery. I root for everyone here to hit it big. Damn the man!

I can... I bought two exercise bikes (non Peloton) and IPad mounts, signed up for the Peloton app and figured it would be just as good. I was wrong. No way to correlate the exercise bikes resistance to what the instructor is intending or compete with other live Peloton students.... SO... I dropped 8k on two new Peloton bikes and it is a much better experience the one fucking time I have used them! Seriously one time in 2 months yet they still get to charge my card for the membership every month till infinity and beyond.

Employers can contribute up to $57,000 (catch-up at $63,500) in 2020; in 2021 that amount rises to $58,000
Here's my story to Wallstreet.

I started on April. I heard that market crashed and wanted to check it. I always thought market is pump and dump scheme that's why I was avoiding to invest in it.  I work at the hospitality. I invested 5k into VAC  it's my first investment. I got 2k gain from VAC. I was into value stocks that time due to their prices were too low and even if I hold them longer I knew that it was gonna bring gains. Investing into vocation stock during the global pandemic yeah that's me :P. Then I started to swing trade. I did my first option trade with AAL during June. I bought it first day when they announced that next month which is July they will open more flights. I went all in to July 18C. I made 9k to 26k next morning. Did I sell? Hell no because I wanted 30k and I wanted to hold 2 more weeks.(Yeah all account in weeklies invested to airlines during global pandemic) My account went back to 9k within 2-3 days. I was in panic then bought Expedia weekly calls account went to 4k. Then AXP 2 weeks out calls account down %85. Lost all the savings total of 13k...

I wish I knew more about options and market. Options trading approval shouldn't be that easy.  Now I'm doing call leaps a year or 6-7 months out also doing some theta gang and studying more on complex options strategies. Also studying what to buy during crashes to make more gain. I don't do yolo or weekly naked calls anymore. I'm still down a lot. My parents don't know that I lost this much amount of money. Well it's nothing for wall street but I make 30-35k a year so its something to me. Anyway I'm gonna be 27 years old next week. It's been a hell of a year. I know so many of us lost too much money this year and some us who are more experienced made a bank.  Well life goes on. Study more and buy the dip when everyone in fear.

*Sorry for my grammar. English is not my first language. I speak/write/read Russian and Turkish to, u fuckng english teachers.*
I started doing this move. My diversification costs me a lot. Some rise 500% gain amounting to $5k instead of $500k which it could have been if i were to put in one bucket...Value investing is real

Securitizing the debt was part 2
1. started w/ $400K cash and essentially no trading experience in Jan 2020. Goals set in +100K increments. Lots of studying.
2. learned how to get the hell out, fast, in Mar 2020. lost $125K.
3. freaked out, took a break. got my shit straight, and got back on the horse. Healed myself from over-trading. Back to $400K in April 2020. Mantra is "Strategy, Discipline and Always have cash to BTFD"
4. yada, yada, boring story, some losers and some big winners (Thanks in large part to WSB!)
5. xmas eve is sitting at \~$800K.

To build on the model presented by u/wallthrowawaystreet: You know options are good because after their expiration you’ve made money on them. Bad ones do the opposite.

But seriously, many of these platforms (I use Schwab) have calculators and models to tell you probabilities that your calls will be in the money by exp. Of course, parameters like volatility are modeled backward and can be wrong, but there are tools out there to use. Check out this summary for the basics: https://www.investopedia.com/terms/o/option.asp.

Also, just keep lurking WSB and other investing subs, find people whose level of risk tolerance you are comfortable with, and ask questions. Amount of cap needed depends on how much risk you’re willing to take and how much you need to make to cover expenses.

Depends on the plan your employer selects.  Some allow you to do self directed investments. But you have to sell the mutual fund that are auto bought and then move the money into an account that your 401k plan works with.
That won’t guarantee anything. The tl;dr of the whole post is basically that this guy has been extremely lucky but wants to ascribe his success to everything but

This is the opposite of what anybody should do in my opinion. Instead, do the ETF and enjoy your 50% annual returns. 

Though I fully agree with you in your thesis. The computing/cloud/AI sector is where it’s at now. Battery/EV has gone too meme for my liking. 

Genomics/personalized medicine is still a bit away from meme status. I work in gene therapy...for one of the leaders in the field. Its a nascent technology that will face a lot of regulatory and manufacturing hurdles. But in 5 years itll be as hot as computing is now.

I hold big positions in VGT and a smaller position in ARKK.

Well, I wanted to imply that he meant exactly what u/PretendImFamous said. There is a lot of things a CEO might like about his companies valuation but not about the stock price.   
As an example $2000 stock price might be to high to give out as entry level bonuses, $400 might be appropriate. Also as an employee I'd rather get 5 $400 stocks than 1 $2000, as it is easier to liquify.

And he did say: "Tesla stock prize to high imo". So you can interprete it as you like, but his wording and his action match my interpretation better.

I started trading options in at the end of August (right before September bear market smh) with 4K. Initially I had some success and got it up to about 7k but since then it’s been a downward spiral. I’ve even tried a couple of paid discords and they only resulted in further losses. This week I finally decided to say fuck it on that trading account and yolo’d on a call that many were yolo’ing on from that same discord and I’m not down to 300. I plan on only doing my own plays starting Monday and growing my account. Diligently setting stop losses, planning my moves out, and playing supply and demand. Open to any advice

It's not hard, but it takes time nevertheless. I'm riding the GME wave for a little more, and then will look for something new. So I don't have an answer for you right now. Last time I actively looked for something (end of August) I've got these on my watchlist: GME, NIO, TSM, NKLA (to short), L А C, ICLN, AAWW, SE, WMT. Of these, I only rode GME properly and NKLA from 36 down to 20 with a quick (losing) gamble on LАC and NIO (paper hands). Only losers here are WMT and AAWW, the rest rose significantly since August. Just find a proper DD, do your own research in addition to that, buy calls 6-12 months out and you're golden.
Merry Christmas WSB and thanks for purchasing my options.

Lots of thoughts:

It's impossible not to virtue signal, don't feel bad about it ever!

You have a great perspective. There's always someone in need near you, I too believe we should help those folks, including being sincere neighbors to them, so to speak.

I made my comment about the animals > people because it hurts my feelings that people hurt people / animals / planet. I don't actually hate other people, just commiserating with your experience that it feels better helping animals sometimes.

I don't buy the explanation given in the lewis quote. I come from very affluent area and the people that I know are extra charitable with money and deeds because they know they are unequally favored by birth and work / luck. 

Our community and nearby culture affects how we respond to inequality. Lewis is biased because he's lived among the Uber selfish in nyc / wall street. He is not explaining how inequality works for most people, in my opinion.

Stay well my friend. Keep doing good work, I'm proud of you.

I used to think I was hot shit for finally being a responsible person and understanding how to build wealth. I went back to school so my source of income kinda stopped but after again getting a job I then started looking at stocks in my industry (tech) and after getting fucked by index funds ( -2% returns in 2020), when WSB was minting money, I finally realized how fucked up this boomer mindset was.

I don't use margin so there's no point for me to lock in 7 grand per contract, since IV is low, as you've rightfully observed, thus premiums are unimpressive. I have better theta plays for the period. 

You might be right, but in the current market for CEOs when they need cash it's better to borrow money using their stock as collateral, especially when the company is growing steadily. It's less taxes too. Elon does this all the time. That's why I'm somewhat skeptical about IRBTs management sell history.

Respect for your gains. I am worried now though that we'll see GME dip because paper hands read this and think they're going to be bag holders. Thoughts?
Lol why
it's free until you pay that sweet 30% tax on your Compte titres ordinaire gains and then pay a 20% tax on whatever you buy with them. and then realize the state grabs half of whatever your employer pays you.

Judging by your poll you’re changing people’s (and their families) lives for the better, this world is so unrelenting when your broke and you’re giving people a chance to change that. Even if you lost it all, someone out there is thankful you took the time to share your Ultra-autistic come up.
lol and hopefully you learned to never buy high IV weeklies
Similar profits to leveraging with leaps calls? Honestly, I don't think so. Guess it's all dependent on the market at the time too though, but I think long term.. covered calls loses to buy and hold

*pls mod dis guy & gimme da flair*
Started educating myself in late feb/early March after seeing a meme on Facebook about investing in travel stocks. Put 10k into the market in April trading Cineworld and made a nice 5k. Moved onto the travel sector (bringing a friend on board at this point) and we traded CCL, NCLH, DAL and AAL and I’d taken my account to 25k up until June 8th. Started a horrendous losing streak because I’d get scared and close my positions early all the time. I went all the way back down to 12k before we started trading NIO months ago. I’m now up to 65k with 80% of my equity in shared and 20% in options. Current positions are NIO and PLTR.

Oh absolutely! They always seem to be one of the first of retail that gets consoles, so they’ll definitely be the first to get more PS5’s and Xbox’s. Profit in that department.
Not to be a virtue signaler or anything, I am still working on this myself.  I am still very poor myself but there are so many people doing worse than me.  A quote from a book I recently read, Post Corona by Scott Galloway:

Michael Lewis writes, “The problem is caused by the inequality itself: it triggers a chemical reaction in the privileged few. It tilts their brains. It causes them to be less likely to care about anyone but themselves or to experience the moral sentiments needed to be a decent citizen.”
Not a good idea to feed the squeeze in my opinion. Either bet on a flatline red week or a skyrocket on a green week of the 15th

What happened to not getting to post about gains/losses without a starting position of at least 6k? Why is this shit even allowed here?
I appreciate that you post DD, before a play at times and others while in action, even if others deride you.  Good luck on hitting the $10 million.

While impressive it’s worth noting for the onlooker that for every guy like this WSB likely has 10 that turned $30k they needed for bills/rent payment into 0.  Survivorship bias is real and it will cause many to blow all their money over and over because “it worked for (enter name) I just need to hit the right play”.  I’m not saying don’t go hard, I do it myself cause like this man said the wage slave game is real and stacked against us, but be reasonable in your degeneracy.

There’s no such thing as a good trader. As much as WSB hates on them, the best actually happens to be buy/hold investors. Everyone else just gets a good amount of luck. 

Experienced traders/analysts have been shitting on Tesla for well over a year now. They’ve been saying it was overvalued at $600, $900, $1500, $2000 (all pre split), and now they’re saying the same thing at $650 post split. 

They’re realizing they have no idea how the market actually works, despite being in the game for 20+ years. They’ve gotten so desperate I’m sure they’re all scrolling through WSB (not just Cramer) hoping for some good DD. But they’re so retarded they still haven’t bought GME. Because they’re “good traders” that follow fundamentals

I first got into stocks when my grandma died left me her life savings in 2007...My family said to "invest it"...so I did gave it to my dads friend at "Banc of America" (not a misspelling) inside a bank of America... 2008...."gonna roll it over here and diversifying here..and it's gone" 0_0... fucker didn't even call me.  2020..market looks like it's gonna crash and I learned about RH from a teenager and I was like omg.. I waited my whole life for a 2nd chance... Calls on shorts on spy. then the dip... buy what I could... sad thing is...it's nothing compared to what I would of had if I was in control of my money. in 2007 I had 2000(@$20) shares of nvida and 10000 of amd(@$1.90).  This fact kills me every day...he sold them...the only stocks I picked to cover his loses in wait for it...AIG...then banc of America disappeared.

GameStop was on my radio even before I learned about the short and Cohen scenario.  COVID has had me casually browsing for a Nintendo switch since March.  I never pulled the trigger, but I would get the urge to about once a month.  Every month the only place that ever had one in stock online was GameStop.  This tells me GameStop has a healthier supply chain for consoles than other retailers in general. This console cycle alone will take GME to the moon 🚀🚀🚀 by next earnings.

For Thanksgiving my parents didn't want to do a big dinner but my aunt and uncle did, I just went to my parents house, my cousins and all of their families went to my aunt and uncles. Turns out my cousin's girlfriends coworker tested positive for covid and she ended up getting it and spreading it to 5 other people at Thanksgiving including a child and an old person.

Nothing wrong with keeping the holidays kind of small this year

It was the biggest fall since the housing crisis. Immediately opened a brokerage acct and got going with 8k. Then about 50k in late summer. Made a lot with arkk, crsp, nuan, ttm, bgsix, dis, and docu. I am not as risky as most here and when I take on something risky I only do a “taste” and watch performance before doing bigger plays. It has saved my ass more times than I can tell you. My biggest losses have been risky yet the losses are small because I employ this method. I have a broad portfolio from mkc to PING with everything in between. I am up 60%. I do not think I’ve sold anything as a loss or if I did maybe a few dollars.

edit: my losses are not yet realized for clarification

Risk and reward can’t be separated in a (nearly) efficient market, so the more reward you want the more risk you have to take. These things are a spectrum, meaning that you can choose to gamble and invest on the same stock depending on the position you take. PLTR shares or LEAPS (I have 2023 50c) are more on the investing side, where monthlies are still “full casino” mode

Yeah. I was watching Bommers news how they were praising a stock because you could make a 10% return.

Bitch I made 40% return from Wednesday 3pm to Thursday 10am, then back to bed.

They are pissed because "normies' without family money "aren't" supposed to understand or participate of this lucrative activity.

People used to study finance and economy, get mentors and earn 9% return ROI.

They don't want to accept that even though millennials only got the crumbles of what once was the more prosperous country, when buying homes and getting degrees was actually affordable. But at the same time we dominate technology and Technology has bring any education and information right to your hands.

They are pissed millennials who are no-bodies of the world can get books, check how traders work on YouTube, check Twitter to see trending issues, go on reddit r/stonks r/investing and the greatest of all r/wallstreetbet and end up with a 2,300% return is what? 1, 3, 6 months?

We are risking too much?
Been millennial is already risky eanogh.

TOO THE MOON MY FELLOW RETARDS
Started trading senior year in high school when I told my mom I could make more money than whatever they had put away for me in some savings account, so she begrudgingly agreed to withdraw the money for me to use. Started with $5K just trading stocks, then got to $9K in about a year which felt amazing and partly due to trading 3X ETS like JNUG and UGAZ, then things fells apart. I tried to get to the $10K dream with a trade with $JNUG and learned about buying the rumor and selling the news. I was hoping the FED would raise rates and JNUG would go up, but they announced a rate hike and JNUG went down....a lot. I was down about $1K and I was pissed so I started looking at penny stock trades. Well that only lost me another $1K and then another and then I got approved for options. $50,000 and a few years later I literally had $10,000 to my name after losing and losing, then, Covid happened...

Threw $5K in SPY puts right before the market correction happened and bam. My $50K was back and I’ve been green All-Time ever since. Broke through the original $10K dream as well. 2020 wasn’t all that bad for me. I learned a lot and have stayed away from weeklies ever since and haven’t had a red week
I made over 500k in the market this year and my girl got me the wrong Xbox for Christmas (Xbox One S). Is it wrong to be mad or should I just be thankful she tried?

I absolutely love IRBT, but my calculations lead me to 70 entry point estimate and I'm waiting for it to load more. Hope the opportunity comes before it goes to the moon.

The only thing I dislike about them is insiders selling. But as far as I can tell it's mostly performance bonus options sold by management.

Doing this in the tax deferred account is smart.  Over 50% of my account is in tax deferred so I can sell CCs on longs.  All of you could learn a lot from Mr Jack A Lot

**You're doing God's work here, NOT by encouraging people to YOLO on binary plays but by giving the history of the ups and down to offer some perspective.  Also, by going back pre-2020.  Great post.**
Just think...you could have nearly doubled this by going all in SPY calls at Monday's bottom.

Or just bought 630c/640c TSLA debit spreads😳

First Post on WSB I have personally read from the beginning to the end. Thanks sir jacked too much. Good luck!
This was the first time I’ve actually read a post this long on WSB, glad I did, very interesting! Merry Christmas SIR JACK A LOT and thanks for all the gains on STIC!
Thank you
no, they suck because their products are zombies.

- within their price range: neato is privately owned. it has pretty heavily software-DRM'd robots which must have massive margins by now because they're basically all the same damn thing! but neato has eclipsed irobot in terms of navigation tech.
- below their price range, aliexpress shit got cheap and okay

no stake. would stay far away from that company, though.

I decided to stay away. My dad has prostate cancer and my state deemed me expendable so have been working all pandemic with very Republican coworkers.

This is objectively wrong though.  Someone on here posted a great DD on GME when it was 7$ literally hours before the Microsoft deal was announced and the stock got halted.  Clearly people were doing the homework on this thing for a long time.  In fact, if you look at where its at from then until now the arguments for a short squeeze are much stronger than the arguments against it.  If you want a better example its NIO.  Thing was trading at rock bottom forever and then it just blew the fuck up out of nowhere.
Tis the season to think of those less fortunate than yourself. Those who are alone.  Those who can’t go home for Christmas, or worse, don’t have a home anymore.  So please put out a helping hand to all those Holding Baba calls.
All good, we’ll get them the next time
Lmfaoooo 😂😂😂 the memes here are incredible
Amazon is really good at not sucking at everything it's a damn web page you fix problems for one category of items and the other category is also fixed


Amazon also gives their coders plenty of stock so they need to actually make the company successful if they want to be successful to

GameStop is just a failing brick-and-mortar business who will never match Amazon in the online world

Pure story stock at this point.  Can play it in the lead up to earnings but very very dangerous to hold through earnings.  It's very pricey right now.  But this market doesn't give a fuck.  If it dips below $40 I'll setup another position.  But it could also run to $80.  It's all magical thinking with this one right now.

Lemme buy ya a Heineken.
It was 3 dollar or a lil below I believe
basically living paycheck to paycheck from 18 --> 27 working server/bartending jobs.  like 550 credit from being dumb at 18, no kids and low debt because my first year at a university didnt pan out. i had to many charges on my record to get into the airforce even though i tested high i was told. so i had no way to make money or get a place to live etc. life was looking like shit.

then i found wallstreetbets. started november 2019 and in june after some good and bad luck i hit my first 1k%. 2k into 20k i felt like a king. we all know what happened next, i leveraged to hard and found my self actually putting back in some money i had taken out. took a month break came back with a new strat and consistently worked my way up and then recently hit another 3k into 30k.  have never felt stronger as a trader.

e/ oh and now i have a place to live and my credit is 680 atm, still working on it i have no debt or kids still :) HAPPY HOLIDAYS

Well when your answer to 46*400 was 46,000...which is literally the first number and 3 0's added, you should do a double take
I’ve been following this sub for a while because of the unbridled enthusiasm for getting rich or dying trying. I was paper trading since June on ToS with mixed results. I saw a tip here about PLTR  in early November so I paper traded 5k into options and at its height it was worth 200k. I thought might as well try. Funded 5k into Robinhood over Thanksgiving, bought around 1k of PLTR 12/31 43 C and it’s worth a couple bucks now. 🤡. Bought shares of PLTR, RYCEY. Bought calls on LAZR and made 6k. Bought calls in T, paper handed VLDR calls. Overall up 3k. 
TLDR: Stonks
PLTR 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
RYCEY 🛫🛫🛫🛫

I'm really glad to see you back, after zjz and you in such a short span of time, I was kind of worried about this place. Big names leaving or being banned and accused aren't a good sign. I went in on GME because of one of your posts and it really helped me recover from Thanksgiving murdering my NIO and CRSR calls. But yo, I was planning on taking profit from NIO calls on NIO day to get back in CRSR with shares. You think I'm gonna be too late for another $36-$37 opportunity?
Me too. Don't really know why though. Shares or options?

I've been doing this with pltr options. Bought 200 @ $25 and I've already made over 1k in the last couple weeks. A couple times I bought back the options that I sold but the first time I sold premium the $30 otm calls were 2.5 each so I made $500 when the stocks were only worth 5k. Easy 10% for not even doing anything. Pltr spiked to $29 but I haven't sold at all on the spikes
I miss haupts meme videos so much 😢

Step five (2-5 years later) end up broke.

Excellent write-up

Is there a possibility that this past week's price increase was the short squeeze? That's it? Or is there a sharper increase on the horizon? In your opinion how much of an increase is there potential for with the current setup?

If you're trading every single morning and you're down that much in this market you need to seriously re think your approach.  I find that I do the worst when I'm managing so actively and my vision becomes too narrow.  I do best when I pick positions and let them run for weeks to months.  You can't force the market to do what you want it to do which is why patience is the key ingredient to success.
Don’t be a dick and go see your folks

GME is a financially healthy company with good prospects. Sounds to me you’re the one acting on your emotions. I can recommend listening to the podcast which has been posted several times.

Take my downvote.  Reading a chart has its place.  I just don’t see it as even 25% of needed info. 

I did say that the better picture you have the more accurate you’ll be.   So, it has its place in the forming of an opinion of a company.  

Financials such as operating cost, cash flow, etc just have a lot more weight. The OP never mentions any of this.  He says he uses indicators and chart analysis.   

I’m not really sure what else there is to discuss
It's really easy. Just know the fundamentals by looking at the YouTube videos.

Draft kings is really good since every more states are legalizing betting every year. Nio is good but id also be cautious at buying at current levels at least at a huge amount until it starts another bull run

I had a lot of struggles trading from April-Sept (during the biggest bull run...). One of the changes I made in October was to focus on one underlying. It allows me to gauge performance against something directly correlated, and I was a *lot* more careful in entering trades. It's reassuring to see someone else succeed bigly by concentrating their portfolio.

While I am not quite at breakeven, I've made okay returns since October, ending each month r/thetagang green. 

Thanks for the post.

Honestly though scholarships are so easy to get these days. My retarded brother got a decent scholarship to a small state school. People just don’t want to go to a C list school and take a scholarship and would rather go to a well known university and take big debt and then whine about it.

Apple: yeah by 2024 we will be in the EV business.

Elon: Wtf did you say bitch? TSLA WILL BE MAKING NON-BITCH SMART PHONES.
Here's a thought for Sacca, it's a wild bull market because of all the new traders.  It seems like every other person I talk to now is actually has at least a couple stocks even if it's just a little bit.

I see people's portfolios blowing up and wanna try myself at it. Any info that helps me get more autistic helps
Go home before it's too late. Next year it might be impossible.

Don't listen to this retard. Robinhood put a hold on your account. Its frozen, they're worried you don't know what you're doing. You'll need to call customer service 800-867-5309. Pray you get Jenny. I can always turn to her, shes the best rep they got.

I highlighted the word monthly because their annual retention rate is approximately 50% hence saying it in terms of monthly makes it sound better and is the right choice if you want to sell a stock.
Upvoted on the thought of your thicc sac
Call your broker and tell them that you want to put in a limit order for opening bell on Monday for $20 over most recent close. Should solve the problem. K, thx.
Yeah, everyone got Tim Apple right off the bat.   Even the prez.
Nah I blew all my gains with degenerate gambling. Cus that’s what I do

Top seller there!  I've been estimating the sales using order numbers on their site.  It's brilliant!
This is very sophisticated - I usually just buy puts on whatever the Motley Fool says will be the next Amazon.

Same lol
Blew up my account earlier this year so account is too small to make any significant gains selling options lol thinking about wheeling when I get my acct back up lol
Same, so confusing?! 😂
Guessing you have options way out of the money now. Probably best to sell and get whatever you can that's not so far out of the money. Strike somewhat closer to current price = higher delta and better increase on any bounce. Of course, that assumes we get a bounce, instead of non-stop bleeding like the last couple months.
Ever since I moved to mostly shares In November I’ve dug myself out of my red hole. Now I’m up 23% off my total portfolio and will be doing it for 2021
To you too brother!
OMG you are hacked 🥸 adios money📉📉📉📉 (it’s Christmas retard)
That's such dumb thought. Use the stimulation for what it purpose is. To stimulate the fucking economy. Rich fuck or not, use this 600 and go buy some bullshit from some local small business. Donate half. Do something with it you humble cuck

You autists are the real deal, sharing your tendies with the needy! Very inspiring.
This shouldn’t be inspiration. This is like going to Vegas and putting all of your money on black and spinning the wheel. This is gambling, not investing. If you want to do the same, do it, but understand the risks. This is no “grind” and if he keeps taking this level of risk the math will eventually win. I know because I’ve been there. The option game is unreal when it’s working, however, when it’s not, things will be over fast. Over the nest few years, many of these “millionaires” will be broke. I’d feel bad if they weren’t so fucking dumb. 

Also, he got lucky with the best year for a large cap I’ve ever seen (Tesla stock has been great for everyone, me included so I can’t complain about that but it’s incredibly overvalued).

Well actually they’re called options because you have the option to buy more puts.

Let me give you a hint - stonks always go up, buy the dip (except nkla)
Definitely risky but I bought more yesterday. Curious to see if funds like ARK continue to buy up BABA next week as I trust them more than Reddit.

DENVER--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Palantir Technologies Inc. (NYSE:PLTR) announced today it was awarded a $44.4m, three-year contract with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). The contract will build on Palantir’s existing partnership with the FDA by providing an enterprise data management and analytics solution for the Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) and the Oncology Center of Excellence (OCE), amongst their other technology investments.

Sooooooo this means they take all the information the fda has on people and drugs and then puts it in a hard drive, runs those files through Hadoop and spark to find patterns, and figure out how to do things they want to do. Essentially they build a big computer to run some software to make pretty charts and graphs with the petabytes of minutia in the research facilities.. making the research faster and more efficient.

Started with stimulus back in March. Turned 1200 to 3100 over 8 months just doing stock trades. Decided I "knew what I was doing" and started options. Went from 3100 to 300 in 2 weeks.

Couldnt resist greed so i open a new account in tastywork just to trade option, obliviously just a part of my funds, the majority was still in shares. Needless to say, my option account went tits up, literally 100% loss, my shares account is blowing up tho. Gotta thanks my buddy for getting me into the market before the market went full retard.
Isn’t there already a rule that say gains have to be more than $2500. Can the gay mods actually do their jobs instead of banning random posts and stuff.

Great post. I had a question regarding your 401k. How did you contribute $26k in January? Is your regular job monthly income that high that you can contribute that amount in one month? I think most places have a limit of 90% of your per paycheck. 

 Also I’m guessing you are over 50 since the regular contribution limit is $19,500 before age 50. 

Any books or videos you recommend to study up on technicals?

I started after getting laid off from my design job because of covid. The optimistic part of me hoped it could replace my income. That didn’t work out though, lol. 

Eventually, I learned how to be profitable with some consistency. +10% an average day. But by then, I ran out of most of my initial 2.5k or so on rookie mistakes. I consider that tuition, the price of learning. 

Now broke af. I’ll come back next year. Until then just refining my technique with small amounts >1k. I’ve determined the best way to manage risk and be successful in this game is avoid PDT with over 25k. Until then I use a cash account through TDA. Everything becomes much easier when you can exit positions casually, wait for price to hit support/resistance, and move back in. 

I hold paper trading competitions with my friends sometimes. I found 2-3 of them also interested in trading. But somehow paper trading feels like easy mode. Real trading with smaller amounts is exponentially more difficult. 

I’m also learning algo trading on the side. I’m not sure if it’s the right solution. Programming the take-profit rules means you can eliminate the emotions. But computers can’t read a chart as well as I can, or at least I haven’t figured out how to define support and resistance algorithmically.
Now is the time to DD
Thanks man. Same to you
$ won’t make up for the loss your fam will feel. Talk to someone.

I think trump as a president was not any better for the stock market than other presidents, and was probably in general bad for the american and global economy, and I think he was a pretty shitty president and an embarrassment to the country, but I don't hate him as much as the average Twitter user. And I think Obama was a good president although I was more politically conservative at the time

Currently bag holding stock at 276. My calls for January are straight screwed and I lose $1200. There’s a lot of strong opinions- both bullish and bearish out there. I’m more bullish long term but it honestly feels like a crap shoot as there are so many factors at play that will be hard to predict the outcomes. Since stock prices are driven by supply and demand I think you have to factor in how people feel about China at the moment (not just the business itself). I wish I had not bought it to be honest and while there is a lot of potential upside I’d only take it on if you’re down for a risky trade and potentially long ride because damn this thing can trade sideways.
Y’all need an actual brokerage with a phone line, real charting software and most of all who gives a fuck. Who you ask? Just about anyone else with horrible apps and good web platforms.

This is a pit of degeneracy, respect has no meaning here
Very well, where do I begin? My father was a relentlessly self-improving boulangerie owner from Belgium with low grade narcolepsy and a penchant for buggery. My mother was a fifteen year old French prostitute named Chloe with webbed feet. My father would womanize, he would drink, he would make outrageous claims like he invented the question mark. Some times he would accuse chestnuts of being lazy, the sort of general malaise that only the genius possess and the insane lament. My childhood was typical, summers in Rangoon, luge lessons. In the spring we'd make meat helmets. When I was insolent I was placed in a burlap bag and beaten with reeds, pretty standard really. At the age of 12 I received my first scribe. At the age of fourteen, a Zoroastrian named Vilma ritualistically shaved my testicles. There really is nothing like a shorn scrotum, it's breathtaking, I suggest you try it.
Awesome! What is this from?
How do you do research on a stock? And how do you pick ones to research?

My roth IRA has just stocks and it has outperformed Cathy Wood this year. Does this make me a genius?
Yes, lol I know. But you're just sweepingly saying only history that you use is accurate. If that were true, then people would only be making money and never losing it. Technical analysts generally start with a fundamental analysis, then use chart patterns to determine areas of support/resistance because, as said earlier, MANY MANY other traders also use technical analysis and it's profitable to understand the patterns that a high volume stock goes through. Lowly retail traders like myself have to rely on as much information as possible.
Thanks for this. I don’t know how to do covered calls. I’ll YouTube it. Is it easy to learn?

I’m very new to investing just started in September. Surprisingly up 25% so far. Thanks to Tesla, Shopify, Net, and Draftkings.

She told me a black guy with a degree in Accounting applied to be a Personal Banker and was rejected for a white blonde girl that had a GED. I'm convinced banks are racist and sexist as fuck.
Merry Christmas everyone!
IRS about to bend you over and take a third of your stack. Hope you set that aside in case you blow the next trade.
But good job, I got halfway then blew myself up in terms of options.
Wow. So that’s why losing ~$100k on options can be in the same category as joking material for you.

How did you get them to respond? I lost over 30000 in unrealized gains in March but they ignored my emails
OTM or ITM?
They'll have a split before they get to that amount but yeah basically
Merry Christmas retards! Hope we have the luck and diamond hands to make more tendies on Monday! 🎁❄️

Why would you not want other people to be happy?
I met Trump at a bowling alley in 2013. He was the oldest person there and kept saying how he wasn’t “too old” for pranks. He said “this is my most powerful prank. I’m going to knock up your wife. I’m not afraid of the law, and I don’t get along with strangers."

I'd say 90% of my lifetime stress was a result of not having "enough" money.  I don't know if there's ever "enough," but I'd like the opportunity to find out. (I'm almost 40)
All I wanted for Christmas was the stock market to be open
I'm not attributing anything to anything. I'm just talking about "under obama" as a time period the same way as "under trump" is just a time period. The average rate of growth in the markets over those time periods was essentially the same, slightly higher under Obama I think but by a negligible amount
Lol. Sounds like you’ve not been outside since April
We are also gearing up for a brand new tech wave! Get into ark before it hits $1000000000000000000000
This is cruel
Twas but a meme from another comment thread where your exact sentiment was expressed
How did you get them to reply? I lost over 30,000 on unrealized gains and they just ignore my emails??
Uh...and how much is 200 shares * $46 again?

I think the downside risk greatly exceeds the pros.  I think holding it over this long weekend would have been way too dangerous.  We dont really know what Chinas communist govt is capable of.  This is not investing it is fortune-telling.

So my gf totally out gifted me today. At least her bf knows what she likes 🤦‍♂️
I lost so much chasing it for weeks and weeks. I had to doubledown for the umpteenth time or else it was all for naught, but I'm still afraid and traumatized. I will never forget this rookie experience
He has no short positions atm. 10 long positions

You could have long called SPY in January under that logic though, that would have been great!

I started trading in high school and my first stock purchases, believe it or not, were Tesla & Netflix before either reached $40.  Being a kid who didn't know anything, I sold both when I doubled my money, which was ~$6,000 to begin with.  I then took my money to the options world and lost all my gains by letting call options expire worthless because I didn't understand vega.  A lot of nothing happens, then FFWD to the pandemic I funded a futures account with $13.5k.  March crash sent that account to $90k in less than a month as I built up to 3 full ES contracts short.  Being full of myself, I traded like a moron until that account was back to $13k.  The emotional pain drove me to read and search for new strategies.  I spent some time in the Sosnoff camp selling options and quickly got bored.  I then read 7 books in a couple months and the one that changed me was Options Volatility & Pricing by Sheldon Natenberg.  I began to study options pricing and learned everything I could about volatility.  I made a daily habit of scanning the market for low IV sector rotations and would scoop up the top 3-4 tickers by volume.  I stuck to tickers with over 1m avg volume, tight bid/ask spreads, using no more than 50% of cash, no more than 3% of acct value in one play, no less than 30 DTE and all the way up to 700DTE, and avoiding memes & tech calls.  At this point, I started hitting home runs, in the last month my best call performers have been X, AA, DISCA, GE, MT, VALE, FCX, M, JWN, ABEV.  I am now confident selling options in high IV and buying options in low IV, I can absorb a black swan event because I always have 50% of cash available, and I don't rely on external forces to generate new plays.  I believe I paid my tuition and have the tools to respond to most market conditions, but only time will tell.

Once it recovered from the 2008 crash, it barley moved

If you attribute the recovery from the crash to his “growth”, it looks better then it was
Two things that drew me to his plays were 1) the simplicity of going all in and getting out whenever (I trade my 401k too and don't have to worry about gains taxes) and 2) You don't need to time it perfectly to get major gains, just the initial uptick. Every stock he has exited has still gone up so I don't feel like I'm having to dodge a bullet quickly on these plays. I dipped my toe in the water after finally seeing a post from him on corsair. Threw 13K in and popped 28% in 3 days. Ended up selling almost at the top at $48. After that I said fuck it and would yolo 50% of my 401k on whatever he tried. $GME so far has made me about $25K. So I'm up 30K in a month thanks to him. Merry Christmas.

Edit: all those that want to try this in your 401k, yolo responsibly. This is your retirement we are talking about. I balance 50/50 in an ETF fund and when my yolo makes me money, I rebalance to shield myself from a single stock tank. I'm also young with roughly 200k in my retirement coupled with living cheap and a wife with a good job, I have a lot of fallbacks to make this play worth it for me. Stay safe and merry Christmas.

It was actually really nice.  You have to look at log scale to have the right perspective. Much less erratic, due to lack of trade wars bs.
😂😂😂 fuck man my first week in here was when disney skyrocketed and i was pissed i missed out on the gains.. shit man you’ll make that make though 2021 is gonna be such a strong fucking bull market lol
I'd invest in that. ARKG brand super soldiers might be profitable.
haha I bought into Cramer's hype for Alibaba too and it's now my biggest loss by far
It’s definitely not Stripe, not sure what else it could be...
Better than they were last year

Fake news! Markets always go up! Up with Clinton! Up with bush! Up with Obama! Even trump managed to not fuck up the trend! Expect the BUYDEN era to be very green with a combination of neo/con liberalism and green new deal!
Which short is the most likely to happen and the safest? I never liked BaBA cuz their website is bad and would love to short them because this isn’t even the real Baba but the VIE structure being run out of the Cayman Islands cuz China doesn’t allow foreigners to own strategic assets. Look it up- I have 100 bucks - can I short them?
Sounds like the way. All in on a couple stocks that are researched to hell
No your just an idiot. Merry Xmas.
In my headcanon Cathie Woods is a supervillain and ARK is a future mega corps conglomerate that basically runs the world and has created the science fiction dystopia in which the Deus Ex video games exist
down -7.7k for the year...still holding a sizeable position in AX PT and a AAPL 135c for 6/21 

Hoping to close these in the green and then Im done fucking around.
Cant b a bitch boi and beg for it
Again, just more life tuition. You are wiser and still alive.
That would be fundamental analysis.
I looked at my stuff again and zillow and AMD are also my top holdings.

Roku just signed a deal with Warner media for hbo max and they are definitely one of the top contenders for streaming devices. Tbh i don't know sustainable it is given that smart tvs become more and more the norm but they are all different and might not offer the universal options these streaming devices offer so for now, it seems like a good play.

80 stocks is too much really but I got like 20 to 30 over the past 2 months which are all up 50 to 150% since they are spacs or ev related or clean energy so I was just testing to see how it goes. Ultimately, I'll let them keep running up and maybe that little investment will really pay off if one of them explodes. No harm since stop losses for everything. 25 to 50 stocks sounds like the most ideal figure.

Pltr is definitely a great long term hold. It's tricky buying it at the current valuation which definitely went up way faster than it should've but that describes a lot of the market these days. It has good prospects long term and is comparable to massive consulting firms so it's good. You can also sell covered calls to make some extra income for those shares
Believe it or not there are other black people who *do* work in finance and have an MBA.

So you're like second in line
Let me buy puts first
😂 

That’s like attributing all the gains/growth to the zoomers who bought at the bottom of the corona crash...

Once it normalized during Obama it hardly went up in 8 years

Not saying it’s Obama’s fault it’s more he didn’t really prioritize the stock market at all.
No more “Markets rise on Whole Lotta Red hopes” I guess

4real.
36 y/o teacher looking to get rich since I’ve plateaued income-wise. I started in early 2018 when I saw you motherfuckers talking about yachts. When I stumbled upon this sub I was blown away. You guys were like even shittier caricatures of Wall Street bros I saw in movies. 

I’ve got a handful of boring ass retirement accounts that are managed by way smarter people than myself so I figured I’d open a Robinhood account where I would learn about stonks, and use it to finance the expensive kayak I’ve had my eye on. 

Bought shares of MU when that shit was the craze. Saw profits and thought this investing thing was super easy. Bought again at like $65 before it dropped. I recently turned a profit on that after bag holding and averaging down for what felt like forever. 

I’ve had an on again-off again relationship with options. I thought about paper trading and read a comment on here basically saying paper trading is bullshit, and how you approach your plays differently when you actually have money on the line. I’m glad I took that to heart and just dove in with tiny AMD plays. Made some money and I was hooked. Completely programmed my brain into ‘timing the market’ and ignoring ‘time in the market’ (that’s what the retirement funds are for)

Learned the hard way about pump and dumps and how shitty the advice on this sub could be when presented to an idiot with no clue what they’re doing. I’ll never fuck around with Chinese companies again. 

I made a little bit of money on the drop in March and finally brought my account to green with the recovery that followed. I can afford the kayak now. After building up a decent nut I figured I’m gonna hold off and see how I can build the account up further. 

I’ve learned a fair amount along the way and enjoyed this white collar gambling. I’m fortunate to not have made plays that were too risky and blow up my account. Internet points are cute, but I’ll let someone share their loss porn. As harmful as this place can be, I’m glad it exists for me to lurk on and laugh at some decent memes/vids.

MU - you were my first and I’ll always remember you

AMD - you’re cool

Various weed stocks - get your shit together

MIK - Fuck you. Failed dead cat bounce experiment 

SPY - I know you’re out to get me, but I’ll keep coming back

DKNG - you restored my faith in risky FDs

RKT - that was a wild ride but you left me with the clap

PLTR - We’ve just begun

Young and poor, I am 54. Shoot for happiness not money. Money is incredibly useful but it's no guarantee of happiness. There are lots of miserable rich people. That said if you are a miserable fuck anyway, money is better than no money.

sorry i was upvoting for the robinhood glitch. the graph is the wrong color. mines always red.
Well that's what PMCCs for ain't it? Long term bullish on the underlying (buy leaps) hedge against downside (selling calls). You're right about the premiums tho. Which is why I was playing with TQQQs. Might stick with them.
I’m British, how much you offering sir rich a lot?
Someone's happy but likely they didn't even notice.
Look at any mainstream subreddit.  Fitness: "Just did my first push up guys." platinum and the front page of all.  Politics: "Guys I think I hate Trump" user has to do an AMA in two days.  WSB: "Cringey introduction thread about buying fractional shares of F." platinum and regurgitated memes in the daily.  Fucking reddit infantilizes the user base especially if you declare that you're a woman whether or not your sex is relevant to the topic at hand.

Honestly bro.. just write yourself a letter to the future..time much better well spent.
I bought into GME because of Ryan Cohen. Knew there was squeeze potential and figured he would be the ultimate catalyst. The case looks much stronger now than when I first entered back in early September. So for that reason I'm still holding all my thousands of shares, patiently waiting. Getting a 3x along the way helps with the waiting 😳

This post really is making me change my trading philosophy. I make small option plays over a variety of stocks, and that is retarded. I will probably find 3 stocks that I really love and put 25k in each as that’s all I can afford. Easier to capitalize on big moves that way

SPY is near all time highs right now. I’m not sure I’d want to get into LEAPS right now. Plus premiums for SPY are not great. 

BABA is enticing. I got one LEAPs at a 200 strike. Gonna wait for the price to hopefully come up a little and then start selling calls

Looks like these are all unrealized gains and the calls don't expire til January. It's not profit until he sells. So assuming he waits until the new year to sell the calls, it'll be another 15 months before having to report the capital gains. But yeah he should set aside a hefty chunk for the taxes.

Edit: January *2022* they expire! I just looked at the image again wow

No. This is completely separate from the itemize vs standard deduction (12.4k this year).

You work healthcare too?
Do I started trading March 2019 I was losing pretty consistently. But my account went up about 500% in that august from tgt calls when they went up 20% to get over 100 on earnings. Ended up losing all of my money. Didn’t really learn that buying weekly calls as the only strategy I have is stupid until this year. My account went up over 400% in a few months from calendar spreads, I was profitable again. And then September came, lots of stupid trades later like weekly iron condors with the Vix at 40, and my account is at zero.
Tl;dr I’m a dumbass.
I'll tell you the truth, kid. Santa is actually your dad
Needs more 🚀🚀🚀
More like half of that, but above 10% so he can't just dump it on short notice anymore.
Rather have the 100k.

I saw your post about STIC before it blew up. I doubted your vibe and passed after debating dropping 5k on it. I won’t doubt your vibe again
Dont forget xpeng. Its down almost -50% from all time high. i predict +9000% upside. Cant go tits up.
Well shit this is the best present ever knowing my G I K is going up 750%. Cheers and happy holidays!
It traded more shares in half a day yesterday than it did in an entire week of the March crash. Plenty of people saw the news
I accidentally bought GME 12/31 calls instead of puts before the drop lmfao. But looking at the charts, yesterday looks like the end of a bull flag and hopefully it pops up nasty on Monday.

I have a very secure job with a great pension so for me playing the stock market is strictly a "side" hobby. I would never consider yoloing my life savings into an FD or anything like that. But even so, I still managed to save up a few thousand in the past 2 months alone post election just from buying shares/ETF's. My options plays on the other hand have been.....less than succesful lmao. But I at least know when to cut my losses (got giga fucked on BABA yesterday though that was a good lesson). I'm definetly a compulsive spender at heart though so I figure if I wasn't putting that money in the market it would be going towards some other BS. If nothing else, the market is great savings motivator for me.

Having Zoomer children, I can say it's a weird place they're in. It's swung so far past "acceptance" to where being non-lgbtq can seem unusual. One of my daughters when she was 11 figured she was probably transgender because she didn't like "girly clothes."  We used to call that Tomboy, and it was just a short phase.  But from her point of view, if she felt "different," that must mean she had to identify as something specific.  They are just bombarded from all directions.  Full disclosure, she IS very-much lesbian.

Donating to charity can decrease your overall tax burden compared to not donating, but you still lose wealth. There is no way in which you profit from it. It’s just another expenditure that’s slightly more affordable, per dollar, due to not having to pay so many taxes per dollar spent.

It’s like coming home with bags full of shopping and saying you saved money because everything was on sale. You could just leave the money in your pocket and be much better off.

The way rich people really make charity work for them is by setting up their own foundations.

Fair enough. If you haven't seen Mr. Holmes you really should. I say that because it profoundly impacted my morals and drove some of the abnormal behavior you saw above (not that I'd be normal otherwise, just different). It sounds like you think The Great Gatsby might profoundly impact me and alter my behavior but I posit that if its message is antithetical to that of the film Mr. Holmes, it won't be able to compete. You might be more likely to become more like me if you saw that movie than I am to become more like you if I read that book. Sorry for this entire melodramatic paragraph of response to you simply making a suggestion - maybe something makes me paranoid about people recommending literary works hoping to have some kind of impact because I'm so dedicated to my unique path in life.

I began in 1995 with $2k, adding $500 per month and buying DELL stock because computers were cool, almost as cool as Magnum PI. l wanted a Ferrari. Navy blue with a cassette player. Then the Dot.com bubble happened in 1999, and I was in everything tech... but my lucky fiscal moment happened as I read comments from Todd Harrison, who was the head trader at Jim Cramer's hedge fund, Cramer-Berkowicz. Todd said the market was the most overvalued he'd ever seen, that he was short up to his boxers,  so I sold everything the day before I left town for a creative writers conference. The next day the NASDAQ drilled 600 points. And it continued falling. l used the money I'd saved to live off of for a year and wrote a novel, which brought me $60,000 in tendies. l started back trading again in 2007. Overtraded like a spastic retard for six years, paperhanding everything and sending great gobs of commission dollars to Scottrade, whose manager actually called and thanked me for transferring so many tendies out of my account and into his firm's profit ledger. Today l daytrade a mid 5-figure account and am up 12% this year (lotsa 60DTE options) while penning my next novel, "Bonfire of the Autists."

#🎄Merry Christmas Retards🎄
I need to cleanse my ears from Carti's album with some Lil Yachty
Many people say Happy Holidays just to begin with since Xmas and New Year tend to be looped in as one “holiday season”. I’m sure some people do get offended by Merry Christmas but anecdotally I’ve never seen that. I have although seen plenty of offense taken for being told “Happy Holidays” instead of merry christmas
Market is closed next Friday. New years
I sell everything. Started with like 25k in the bank or so, didn’t need it though, I just bought inventory on a 0% APR credit card.
On what exactly?

It's not triggering to say or hear merry Christmas, nobody gives a fuck but brands which makes sense. Also plenty of people still say happy holidays, which for some reason seems to trigger more people
100x leverage. He means he has 0 leverage and the money is 100% his lol
no, but some people are such cowards they go with the happy holidays cause they don't want to offend non-existent people. There is a stigmatism by the media that Christians are idiots, and people try to hide all information for fear of discrimination.
Holy shit. We are all gonna be rich next by this time next year. 😎

Damn that’s awesome man. I hope this was major life changing money for you and you continue to grow the account.
I started in January 2019. I had my first job out of undergrad from late 2018 and had disposable income for the first time. I really got interested in stocks after starting my 401k and then I stumbled onto options and wsb. I bought spy calls and nio options and other weekly fds which did well before March to April where stonks went flat and I lost 3k after buying like dumb ass nio calls with no volume so there was literally no buyer for a week and a half as I watched it bleed to 0. I kept buying options after that trauma of the biggest loss of my life albeit not often and kept losing money. In 2020, I bought a huge chunk of my savings into the March dip by getting apple, Microsoft, and great long term valuated tech companies and made 43k so far and recouped all my losses by a huge margin. I started to capitalize on ev memes or other fast short term plays. I joined theta gang and started the wheel. Now I am proud of my portfolio and occasionally yolo on stuff like gme, steel, or other spacs which is the new cool thing into tendies.
Any word from Belle Delphine yet?

It’s not about how much the share price is. It’s about how big the market cap is! Look at Tesla and Apple, Apple is still a way more valuable company but Tesla’s stock price is 3+x higher

In our society you are supposed to receive financial compensation in direct relation to how hard a job is to do. We understand that a Dr. Should make a ton of money because they had to go through a ton of schooling and training to be one. Only the best of the best can make it, so they deserve to be paid more.


These motherfukers though have completely mixed up correlation and causation when it comes to themselves though. just because you can make a fuck ton of money doing something does not inherently make it require more skill or intelligence. 

They're butthurt that we are revealing their super special profession reserved for the best and the brightest minds is actually not that hard to do at all and maybe, contrary to what their mommies would have them believe, their not special at all. They got a degree and learned how to earn 3% annual increases.
We are connoisseurs and creators of the finer things in life

My understanding is that it isn’t raising taxes. You first inflate your way out of it a financial crisis. Excess taxation only occurs when full employment is reached. Alan Greenspan said, "The United States can pay any debt it has because we can always print money to do that. So there is zero probability of default."

Check the daily pinned thread.  If there are rocket emojis then buy that stock.  Load up on PLTR and MT.  Welcome to retarded nation.
It’s worth 2.23 trillion at its current price, I wonder if we need to see mad inflation occur for earnings to ever catch up, at least in growth, to market cap
Started on March 15th this year with $5k. Bought puts during the dip and was up $500 or so and then things started turning around. I got caught up in diamond hands and rode it down to $2200. 

I then started trying to make it back on earnings plays and things that should work (but never do), like shorting the entire country of Italy. I was making it back but slowly. So I deposited another $5k and caught some VIX DD from /u/dlkdev and bought some calls that worked out. That took me back up over $10K - all the way to $12.5k.

It's at this point I told my wife about all of this and bought her a new oven.

Then I went back in with $10K and got caught up in clang gang which was a loser. Down to about $5K now and all in on GME.

I have another account I use for more theta-gang strategies and I'm up about $7K for the year there, so overall up about $4K for the year so feeling pretty good.

I made ~500 trades across three or four brokerages (RH, TW, Fidelity, Vanguard) so I'm going to hate tax time.

Also, Vanguard is surprisingly nice for trading options. Who'd have thought?
1. go fuck yourself
2. see 1
So it's good for everyone if Baba and ultimately China as a whole is hurt by this. Wsb likes free money but it doesn't matter how good something looks if you ask me, pumping money into China or Chinese interests is a bad call.
Same here. I’m debating if I should pull out 50k from my AAPL bank account so I can gamble it on Spacs
My boss spited me for not helping clean up around the office as much as I should of. I was talking to an old friend at the job who also happened to be a client. I wasn’t gonna walk away from a woman who’s a friend and also a client of mine just to help clean. I valued her thoughts of me personally and on a business standpoint as more valuable. Anyway my boss then chose to lay me off for two weeks even though she promised she wouldn’t. I was already value investing with no luck and every position I had was down. I said fuck it I got no job and no income for 2 weeks I gotta try something different. I put the last check I had in my Robinhood it was about 300 dollars. I bought a call 2 weeks out on spy and I made 50 bucks after 2 days. Felt great I continued to buy calls EOD and usually puts midday. Doing this I perpetually made 100-200 a week without working. I did this for about 3 months. My account kept growing and I just repeated this process averaging down along the way. Eventually I got a much larger account and started studying more and yeah. Now I swing trade options Months to years out. All started from my boss giving me the shaft and we later ended up with a great relationship. I was now making so much money through options I didn’t have to beg for work anymore. I could say no, that brought her down a lot and made her treat me fairer. Now things are ok.

Tlt, jnj, ko, rgnx are my picks..the dollar should bounce next week and that will give tlt a lift. Money has been pouring into us income funds and powell is buying 20-30 year bonds every day... the dollar weakness has held tlt back but now it looks like the euro hit a wall and thats good for tlt...i dont see why anyone would be heavily selling them into a thin market until it gets back to at least 160. Hopefully higher. It’ll happen quickly too imo...jnj and ko are heavily weighted all the equity etfs getting flows....dividend, value, and the total stock market etfs..they also do better in a falling rate environment and have basically no reason to sell right now. If you bought the dip in either to start the year or in November after the vaccine came out youre up enough not to want to sell and take the tax hit. They also have positive earnings catalysts for q1...vaccine, pent up demand for elective surgery and a lower dollar for jnj....lower dollar, stimulus,and reopening story for coke....rgnx is a good small cap growth stock to have to complement my dividend plays.. it is also in a lot of popular etfs and i just believe biotech is going to be really strong going into next year. Its another area that people bought the dip on and are sitting on huge profits but cant sell for tax purposes ....biotech also benefits from falling rates. I’m hoping Monday and Tuesday open red so I can sell my Tlt, and buy Rgnx calls on a dip.

I'll do naked straddles and strangles but I approach with caution for sure.  I'd never do a naked straddle on something like TSLA, but I would on HD or something that generally trades in more of a range.  Overtime I've found it is worth it to just throw on some long delta 10s to at least define your max risk and reduce the margin requirements of the trade.
In opposition to this, in the USA one out of every ten people above age 45 has a net worth above $1.3 million.  One out of every four people above age 45 has a net worth above $450k.

I grabbed four Baba calls on the dip hope we get some good news 🤨🙄
I've found that one of the best things I've done over time is take money "away from the markets" and put it in things I can't really touch, mostly real estate.  It forces me to be more disciplined in my trading as well.  When I take money out, I am more focused on working my way back up to the previous level, vs. getting carried away with any house money and making crazy bets.

You will be ok. Most traders couldn't stop thinking about baba's being down for too long. They are all hungry for it.
I don’t think so bc SPACs let the the company negotiate a predetermined valuation for the deal. Direct listing is basically an auction where the market is the bidder so there is no guarantee they get the valuation they want.
BFT is Paysafe but also catches the iGaming and eBets craze going on, I see $30 easily tbh

I’m usually wrong on S PACs, but on the conservative side. I just have a hard time keeping up with some of these evaluations and holding through 😅

I got expensive shit for my gf and my gf didn't bought me anything. Look at bright side, at least she got u sth!
Merry Christmas, and Fuk you, I did it and lost a grand, had 7 contracts open, my first trade in options, PLTR 12/4 35c x2, and PLTR 12/4 40c x5.  Luckily I closed to sell with a grand of loss!
Why not paper trade?
That’s really the only thing keeping me from buying BARK vs STICK
Im strangling the fudge out of PLTR so I'm loving all the price movement.
I'm standing outside in a line around the block in March....CURLF around $3/share....

Some of them go nuts like QS. BRPA got pumped to like $60 on a low float. I think BFT goes over $30.
Holy fucking shit dude go watch some videos on YouTube or something. This is not the sub for you.

For those plays its good to have a stop loss over the first 15 minute high. After volatile opens the direction for the rest of the day is often decided after the first 15 minute candle.
Statistical data also behind it, also a pattern prop traders look for. 

Anyways sick gains. I'm playing for the bounce to 230/235 with a bull spread. Wish me luck.
Few tips:
If you didn't sell it isn't gained yet.
Don't fomo stocks.

I think Tesla is already fairly risky.
If you want something less risky apple always has been a good buy.
(no disclaimer here as I don't hold apple stocks myself (yet!))

Started in 2009 when I was 20. Blew up 3 20k accounts in a few years. Basically spent the first 5 years trading everything from sub penny stocks to biotech to blue chips and learning as much as I could on a daily basis. Now I'm 31 and made over 300k this year. Obviously this year is a one off but normally I average 70k or 80k a year since like 2015 2016. So, stick to it kids! Dont give up if you truly enjoy this. I truly enjoy it so that helps alot.

I'm not joking either. I dont trade options just shares

Hello, fellow dildos.
Enjoying the fan fiction so far though? I hope so, it would make me feel less bad. Who knows, maybe FF is what I meant to title it and my finger slipped to DD. 

The upper edge rn is only in hot dense consumer electronics though.
Dense as in small consumer electronics. High $value/cubic inch.

Newest gadgets will always be the focus of the image. TradeUP PowerUP program at it's core, is actually also to get you to upgrade more frequently/regularly because after 2 years for example(from release date) your device will no longer be accepted and you would have to go through the 'inconvenient route' if you want to get $$/value out of your used device. 

Nawmsayin?

I'm not sure if I can everyone over because I can see how used electronics can fall into the same category as GoodWill donations to you ballers but I'm gonna keep trying. 

Pt 1 was the baseline/foundation with the gaming core

Pt 2 and 3 were the framing (although in Pt 2 I started framing walls, then before finishing it got sidetracked to framing the trusses and I didn't really show you guys what it would look like clearly)

In Pt 4, I'm gonna do the utilities like electrical, plumbing, gas and HVAC that's gonna blow cold hard cash.

I hope you still got a few more minutes to spare me so I can show you how everything would all work in this house of tendies in Pt 4!

Merry Christmas/Happy Holidays!

Started at the end of April this year with 2.5k and in a matter of weeks lost 1k. Managed to make it back to even but currently down 400 dollars. My best play was riding the NIO wave early on, making 400% profit on that position. I've certainly got better but still more progress to be made.

This is so damn true. Literally one post from a complete stranger on the internet claiming to know about steel and I throw a couple thousand into MT calls.
This is an ultimate mystery to me. I have so many theories for how to sort through it but everything too closely resembles blind luck working backwards

I made a post about CLF FDs in November the week the steel squeeze really shot prices up, a day before its largest gain this year. Hilarious, because I know almost nothing about steel, but something about a random (real user, new to WSB) comment in the daily thread reading “CLF my dad called me from work” was so non-spammy and out-of-the-ordinary that I had to see what was up. It wasn’t ‘competing’ for my attention so it didn’t set my bullshit filter off. Took all but 5 minutes to confirm the inevitable brovid steel shortage and that CLF had just acquired the US operations of, you guessed it you slow motherfuckers this month, MT. And god bless the confidence making that thread gave me to put a third of my portfolio in it.

Isn’t that a fascinating trail of information? I made a few people a LOT more money than I did and I tripled my portfolio. Retards all the way down the line except for 1 short comment

I started trading a few years ago when I graduated college. One of the first stocks I ever invested in (after a lot of DD) was TLRY on it's ipo. Figured it'd be a solid investment and sure had a lot of hype around it. 

Well.. not sure if anyone's familiar with how that massive pump and dump went.. but I can still remember thinking how much of a genius I was for getting in at $22/share when it spiked above $200. Only to watch it go down about $100 in a single day. What a great introduction to how MM manipulate the fuck out of the market 😂😂
past the customary recession in the capex cycle already is the presumption, plus the savings rate

Sativa is the general name given to the longer flowering strains of cannabis which grow near the equator which has a much longer growing season. Indica is what you call the strains which grow naturally in a shorter season such as Canada or Afghanistan. It has nothing to do with shape or high but where the strain naturally grows and it’s flowering time. Almost all commercially grown cannabis is indica or a hybrid because like us retards, growers want to make more $$$ and the difference between an 8 week flowering time and a 12 week flowering time is 50% gains.

The truth is this place has never been better. The quantity of brains all connected and churning out information at break-neck speeds is truly something to behold. Fuck old WSB, this place is evolving.
So do what I did. I had no fucking clue what I wanted to do at your age so I worked odd retail jobs until one day, at 24 I said fuck this shit. So I googled highest paying two year college degree. Number 3, was electrical engineering technology and was offered at my local college. Went back to school, treated it like a job. Found a job in the power utility sector and it absolutely changed my life dude. They pay bank, lots of overtime and job security. I made 86k my first year, 96k my second year, 106k my third year. 115k my fourth year, 107k my fourth year, 102k my fifth year. All varied by storm overtime and such. I was able to put away a ton in my 401k, move our of my parents house, have some fun money for trading. I'm 33 now. Moved to new state and still work in utilities. I make a bit less now, finishing the year at 82k. But my qualify of life is much better in my opinion. . 

Community college, two years of treating school as work and my classmates as friendly competition changed my life forever

Tldr: go to community college to learn a trade
I know most of the experts recommend buying and nearly every analyst thinks it’s undervalued, they just don’t like Benioff’s willingness to overpay for acquisitions. So I still think it’s got room to move a lot but I’m not sure if it’ll be at $260 by March. Although earnings are happening in March and the run up to it should definitely get the price moving. So in your shoes I’d probably ride the earnings hype up and sell it off before they actually release their earnings. Good luck!

Everyone is a genius in a bull market.

It’s not like this is a new phenomenon. You could literally throw darts in March and still make out with 100% gains since then.

There was one guy who I think made 20% gains since April in r/investing. He decided to go 80% bonds and then some divided stocks. Even if you try you couldn’t do worse.

The tech was actually banned in Japan. They have a bad history of cadmium poisoning. That is one reason Solar Frontiers put their research behind CIS instead of CdTe.

There are a lot of options for solar technology’s that could be integrated in a solar roof product. I don’t see why CDTE would be used instead of traditional ploy silicon or a competing thin film tech. 

But hey I could be wrong. Cd is actually not bad when combined with Te in terms of harmfulness but most consumers are not going to know that. They are just going to see the word cadmium and think bad.

I mean that "euro is more than the dollar" thing doesn't really work

The reason being: you're all buying stuff in Euros. A game is still $60 / 60 euro. Cars are 25k dollars / Euros

The exchange rate doesn't influence buying power

But that's not too bad for 19 as you say. Idk what kind of apprentice you are but here we have trade schools and you can finish those and be stuff like a mechanic, plumber, welder, etc. And those tend to pay pretty well.

If she'll bear your children and stay with you without manipulating you to be miserable for some sick benefit to her, you're good bro. Stop overthinking the shit or you'll just cause yourself pain going way too deep with internalizing the fact that women are more valuable than men which isn't actually any individual's fault and sucks to resent your partner for
My right hand would never commit such blasphemy
Come February there will be an additional 1.8 BILLION shares entering the market.

From employees and early investors that were happy to sell their allowed 20% for $9 a couple of months ago. 

I have a pretty strong feeling they’re not going to hesitate to sell a large part of their remaining 80% for 25-35 when they’re finally allowed after lockup.

Lots of pumping going on as well,  what billion dollar revenue company sends out news about $4m deals? Papa Karp is surely maximising stockholder value right?

I’d love to get in, the tech is nice, but there are so many red flags. I’ll wait until after earnings and lockup.

Cuz you hold leaps for months. While on FDs, if it expires OTM, it’s gone, with leaps, you got time

Leaps are just longer way to lose money
I am also curious
Tbh I was here on another account years ago when we used to have lots of in depth DD and market education and I think this high-pressure shit stream spewing out of the valve nowadays is more useful. When it comes to the human brain being exposed to data to tune one's natural intuition, I guess the quantity matters over the quality of the data.
started to take it more real around september of last year.
In may 19 i yolod everything in tesla stocks + options near the bottom (~40 pre-split), in september it grew a bit.
Total capital was around 40k back then & i ordered my tesla model 3. Due to delays with the delivery it took until ferbruary - which was to my advantage, as the stock had doubled & papa elon payed for my new car that way.

Then i started to take it seriously with the 40k house-money i got.

After dabbling a lot in the european warrent-market i switched to IBKR end of october to trade directly in the US.

Yesterday 1-2 hours before market close i finally entered the 2-comma-club.
In the meantime i went part-time at my job - so i only work 2.5 days/week + have thursday/friday exclusively for options around expiration :)

This massively helps me to manage my risks & enter many cool swing-trades with "little" risk. Most of the time put credit spreads for around 50% of my available marging.
Rest is LEAPS & Stocks.
Started to sprinkle in some ARKG some weeks ago - that are up 25% or something like that since then.

I think i am a pretty "reasonable" investor around here.. only up >250% since my switch to IBKR.

tl;dr:
40k in Sept -> all TSLA -> 90k in Feb, bought model 3 -> back to 40k house-money again. -> european warrants until october without the possibility of shorting - up to around 300k -> switched to IBKR & options -> up 250% since then & entered the teslanaire-club within 2 months ;)
Modern money theory isn't arbitrarily giving people money I don't think.

>taxes need to be raised to compensate for overspending

Isn't this exactly what modern money theory says?

Insane. I’ve always liked the idea of being an older more available dad.

I just don’t want to have that experience. I also don’t want to sacrifice time from my kids to be able to provide extra things besides basic needs. If I had kids that is
It is going to significantly devalue our currency. You can’t keep spending money you don’t have and rely on inflation. Also, arbitrarily giving people money hoping they spend it on the economy is the dumbest thing ever. If anything, taxes need to be raised to compensate for overspending.

I'm a 32 year old retarded resident doctor Was interested in investing and read a few books about it but never pulled the trigger until COVID-19 hit the US.  It was kind of cathartic to get my mind off of things when not caring for patients in the ED or ICU.   Also with an unborn kid on the way, I needed to raise some extra money to pay for upcoming daycare expenses (US daycare is extremely expensive btw).  Anyways, been riding the COVID wave with \~30k to start and up \~60%.  Now currently exploring options...
Cuz dollar will lose value, lots of stimulus coming which is very bullish. Tax increase don’t matter cuz lots of companies are losing money anyway, so no taxes

My prediction for 2021 is +25%

Then for 2022, depends. If not much inflation, I say it could be a red year. But if there’s more brrrr on 2022, I say another +25%

Biggest driver in this is Fed 0 rates and Janet Yellen being treasury in replacement for Mnuchin

What do u think investors said during the dotcom bubble? kek
I turned 18 in February, and my friend convinced me to get Robinhood a week prior when he turned 2.7 grand into 4 grand.

Put 2 grand in, shorted the market and some airlines and turned 2 grand into 13 grand by mid March, then back to 3.8 grand by shorting spy in April and May. Slowly got back up to $4.5k then transferred over to TD ameritrade. Went all in on SHLL and turned 4.5k into 20k, but held for too long and ended up with 10.9k. I’ve been grinding since late October and I finally broke $17k yesterday. But looks like I’m gonna he charged at my parents tax bracket, so I’ll be taxed fuckin 37% on my profits 

TL;DR turned $2k into $13k back to $3.8k to $20k to $10.9k and back to $17k

Opened a RH acct back in 2017, started with the free stocks. I didn’t do shit until jun 2019 when I bought 1 share of BYND for $160 and rode that rollercoaster for over a year. I picked up some other shit along the way, crypto, F, CGC, and REGI when it was $18.


&nbsp;


Let shit simmer for awhile and didn’t get back into the market until this past August/September. I added about 4K of my own money started tracking IPOs. Got into PLTR, CRSR, GDRX and some SPACS. 


&nbsp;


In October, a financial backer seeded
me about $3,500, which I used to increase holdings in stocks that paid divvies; T, PSEC, some other REITS.


&nbsp;


Didn’t start trading options until Nov 5th. First couple I believe I sold for small losses, I think RKT was my first, first one. Sold a FSR for profit. Day traded TSLA FDs when SP announced its inclusion. A lot of PLTR and a lot of other shit too. The most recent profits I made were off of FEYE’s movement.


Anyway, long story short, I’m up 82% all time now.

Don’t be so fucking dramatic. If you want to throw money away and die then do everyone a favor and just give it to a charity or something. If you want to actually make money then stop gambling on shitty fomo plays and weeklies and get some fucking help. A living retard will maybe have a hard time for a while but will eventually have a chance to own some dollars again at some point through income or the allowance that daddy gives you or sucking dicks behind Wendy’s or whatever. A dead retard has a zero percent chance of ever making any dollars again. You seem to like gambling so maybe you should take the gamble of remaining a living retard.

I'm a 32 year old retard with insomnia. Back in 2012 I was a soldier in Afghanistan. I read a book about Vanguard index funds and decided to dump my deployment money, about $30k, into VTSAX and let it ride. In 2017, I decided to get out of the Army. That $30k was now $90k since I kept dollar cost averaging a couple hundred a month into it over the years. I took that money out and bought 3 duplexes in TX by putting 25% down. I bought a fourplex with the VA loan after that. 

I got hooked on buying properties and needed capital for the down payment. That's when I discovered options on YouTube. My first play was buying FB calls after the Cambridge Analytica scandal in 2018. Those calls printed and I was able to buy myself another duplex.

I found a decent $85k job in Seattle in 2018 and just traded theta gang throughout 2019. In 2020, I bought a bunch of Tesla calls prior to Q2 delivery announcement. Those calls printed and I was able to purchase 3 more duplexes and 3 more single family houses leaving me with 10 properties (19 units) total. I am in the process of converting them all into Airbnb's and by the end of next year I should be grossing about $425k/yr (netting about $250k/yr).

I have about $106k left in my RH account. I've been selling along the way because I'm a retard and I know that I would probably lose everything if I had all that money to play with. Thanks to retards from California moving to TX and driving up property prices 15%+ per year for the last three years, my rental property portfolio is worth close to $2.5 mil now (net worth is about $1.1 mil).

Sounds like Timothy Sykes. He traded his college money into a few million during the dot com bubble, and then he shorted all the way down into a few more million when it crashed. Then he tried to start a hedge fund right after college and bankrupted it lol.
I went back and looked at my trading history to see what I could learn - every decent gain I've ever had on options was on longer dated stuff, at least 6 months out, and held for more than 14 days. Every time I tried to trade options with less than 30 DTE, I lost my ass - not so much to theta, but to paper handing because of the extra variable of an approaching expiry making trading more complicated.

Now I mostly buy shares and leaps and I'm getting a consistent 2-3% per week. Not as exciting as some, but it's enough to pay all my bills and expenses so my paychecks can go straight to more arkk, tsla, PLTR, whatever meme stock wsb is pumping right now.

If the S&P did +28.88% in 2019 and +14.62% in 2020 why is everyone so positive the market is due to skyrocket in 2021? Normally, you'd expect a flat or red year after that kind of performance given the nothing special economy going on. GDP been pretty range bound 1% to 3% the last 10 years.
No I saw this in r/okbuddychicanery
I think some carbon thing is how they make money. It isn’t the cars. Maybe someone else can explain. I don’t own it bc I am not a fan but have exposure through arkk.
I was an overly gifted kid and a whiz at picking stocks starting at about age 10 but my mom didn't trust me enough to invest when I suggested bailout-era GM or pennies-era bitcoin or Zen-announcement-era AMD. I only ever had internet girlfriends and I promised my most recent internet girlfriend I'd buy her a Lamborghini someday and after she left me I couldn't get over her so I started investing to try to deliver on that promise and win her back. It felt like I would only have 2 or 3, maybe 4 years tops to get this done before I'd be too distant of a memory for her to even care, because she wasn't even talking to me. At first options trading seemed stupid to me because I was easily up 20% in my first month swing trading stocks after depositing like $100 but then I did the math and found I wasn't on track to get that Lambo fast enough so I tried options trading. That converted me from a keen investor outcompeting the shit out of the market on my first try, to a retarded gambling addict. Every time I lost I got more desperate to make up the gains, more sure I could never be good enough for her to love me back, and the most painful thing was I could see it happening, I could see I was destroying my life with this self-fulfilling prophecy, making myself fail her with a vicious cycle of being scared of failing her making me fail more making me more scared. Eventually that got my account down 85% and it officially felt like I had to stop sucking then and there or I'd die. My next trades had to be good, my life depended on it. So I took a little break, an excruciatingly terrifyingly long little break with how scared I was of time passing. Then I started trading again. And now I was good. Now I could finally pick the winners without FOMOing into too many losers at the same time. I bought a United Airlines put while the market was crashing with covid news. Would have doubled the money I put into it, but Robinhood, those tricky bastards, they noticed. They said "oh shit, this guy is getting skills, he's gonna take back all the money he's lost - quick, steal his one good trade and lock his account." So they did. They forced my United contract to sell at a loss, literally minutes before it started climbing to where it would have doubled my money in its final hour. They called it "risk mitigation" or something. Then they locked my account, unable to make purchases, down over 90% all time. But that girl was talking to me again, so I gave up for the year. Then later this year I found out she's been dating some douchebag who doesn't care about her the whole time. Now I'm mad. And now society is imminently collapsing so I still have to operate in rush mode. But I can't let that fear of time passing fuck me over. I bet she wants to leave the douchebag she's with and if I can get so rich I can afford to make it financially viable for her to do that with no strings attached, she probably will, then I can get her to stop being an idiot and start preparing for the apocalypse. I figured both our lives would ultimately depend on this the whole time, it's not like the societal collapse is so new, but now that collapse is imminent so it has a different effect, like how being scared of failure suddenly had a different effect when I got to the point of being down 85% with absolute irrecoverable failure imminent. I trade better now because my life and that girl out somewhere's lives depend on it. I've only completed one full options trade since I got back, a RAD call I took profits on at a little over 20% gains. Even though in cash value those gains were only $12, I'm proud. The percentage is good and I know I'll take back all the hundreds of dollars I've put into this account and then so much more.

IRS can’t do shit. If you live overseas and just don’t report your earnings, the likelihood of IRS catching you and persecuting you is actually very low. IRS doesn’t have enough resources to actively monitor the financials of all US citizens abroad. However, if you do get caught, IRS will take all of your foreign assets and then lock you up for good measure. They purposely make the penalties extremely severe to scare everyone into complying.

I started trading CFDs with IMacademy but it turned out their techniques didn’t always give results. Sometimes very bad losses. 
Then I started swing trading by buying signals but it turns out they were absolutely moronic as well . 
Then after blowing accounts a few times, I started learning about price action and technical pattern analysis and been trading with those techniques. But my account was blown again this November. Haha so much fun
Now I’m gonna follow my heart and throw my money on something I find here on wsb. Let’s see if it makes me money or I loose some. Haha I dunno, I’m like pretty bummed out with trading altogether because no matter how many techniques I learn, things go wrong a lotta time. Haha, I’m gonna yolo my way to riches.

When I was a kid my parents, grandparents and especially my dumbass uncle set me up with some boomer stocks, DIS, Procter&Gamble, Coca Cola, Ericsson, H&M, you know, everything bought around the dotcom. I gained control of the account around 2015, and it was barely making a profit. Had around $2k in the account and dumped another $2k in. Been trading since 2017, and this februari i was up to $5k. Then ’rona hit. In the summer I found WSB but was too much pussy to start gambling. Finally in november when I just got up to 5k again, I dumped my small gambling sum of $200 into tesla with 5x leverage. That shit made 600% return by 18th december. I also found THC🐝 and decided to sell my mutual funds to dump into that. Now I am up to ~$9k and finally feeling good about my trading

Edit: my goal is to have 100% return before EOY. And $100k by 2022. Then I’ll set new goals

No shit. It’s right in the title of the study. Holy. Fucking. Shit. I didn’t say THIS was. I said look at efficacy studies and compare how their portion of immunogenicity was done. 

You said this was a ‘standard’ study. I don’t know what studies or research you were part of but this isn’t ‘standard’. It’s bare. Fucking. Minimum. 

Stay in school kiddo. You’ll learn that vaccine research has major parts that all have done correctly at each interval to be part of the whole.

throw me on to the list for the trading room if there's a spot.  I'd love to listen in to people who have more experience
When I was 14 I realized I was gay and into gay bears.

Fast forward to 2017 and I traded crypto to make my gap year in Europe last longer, barely succeeded as the great crypto crash of 2018 almost ruined me. 

Last year started trading on Robinhood again, barely made anything sticking with crypto and was impatient on a few stocks. 

 Roommate told me about here right as the pandemic swept through Europe. Was horrified at the constant (seemingly derogatory) mentioning of gay bears so I beta'd and bitched out. He convinced me otherwise, so I found someone saying buy TVIX calls. I didn't understand what calls were so I threw $1,100 at the shares, made it to $7k, fell down to $2.2k, threw it at a few "safe stocks" because I didn't think the market would keep going up, but the shares didn't really do anything and declined.

 Decided to change my strategy and started options trades at the end of August. I threw more money in and at first post money, but then threw $1700 at ICLN $20 C 4/16/21 and my luck changed. Now up 291% ($17,000) on RH for the year. Still too beta to be a true gay bear and try puts.

So the market isn't open, what am I supposed to do wtf
You either got to find a company that’s definitely going to grow or a company that’s beaten down and buy both on a red day. Take Gilead for example the stock has been on a tear to the downside and has only been stacking new companies onto their arsenal. Buying a leap for 2022 strike 60 could make you a good amount of money. Once the trend reverses the stock can take back 70 within a year.
Because Tesla's innovation and moat is the battery not the car. So Tesla only gets fucked if the Duracell bunny finally catches up.

I’m 21. Started trading in January this year. Threw my life savings from working at Starbucks for 3 years, part-time (£2000) at Tesla, AMD and ETF’s like a r/investing virgin. Got fisted in March was down 65% when I stopped looking. I had oil, airlines and CCL because I thought dividends and compound interest was going to make me rich...
💎🙏🏼The fuck out of March and bought the dip like a chad through March/April all while jerking to my favourite Buffet poster - “Be greedy when others are fearful”.


Broke even again in July but now with £4000. Found WSB in August caught retarditis and got fisted again. This time by HYLN. Bought at $28 before merger and bagholded like a cuck through merger to sell at $28 after merger after it running up to $55+ pre merger.


Then found r/SPACs and set a rule of only owning a maximum of 5 stocks at a time. Made a lot with RIDE, SBE, PLTR, CRSR, WKHS and others mostly taking 40-80% gains apart from UPWK with a 130% gain. And currently holding SRAC, NGA, APXT all bought under $12 with a plan to take profit at +100-120% and a sprinkle of GME at $13.80 for the memes. Just closed over £11k for the first time yesterday. So to sum it up turned 4K of my own money into 11k since July +175% in six months. If I can keep up these levels of autism hopefully I can graduate from r/SmallStreetBets in a year or two.


Merry Christmas all! Here’s to another year of cocaine and stimmy fuelled markets.


Hopefully, I’ll unlock my true inner autism and my girlfriend will finally leave her boyfriend for me.

Uhhhh woahhhhh there buddy. Your mental health is wayyyy too tied up in money. You are young. My financial advisor told me that when you are young your biggest asset is time.  Money WILL come and go. You have YEARS to invest and long the market.  You might even lose thousands here and there. Thats ok. I’m assuming you are able-bodied and have many years of work ahead. You can leverage that income into smart moves.  You could buy a rental property, open up a small business, learn a trade or get back in stocks at the right time.

Read my post history dude. I lost 40k but I’m not gonna kill myself. I’m still here living, breathing. You survived 2020,  you survived COVID so far. Don’t yeet out of existence or yolo your last savings and make your life shittier than it already is.

So here’s what I think about timing the Market and the conventional wisdom surrounding it-

Let’s look at last March, for instance, markets dropped about 35% from feb 20 to mar 20.  My question is, could a 35% drop over a month in the S&P possibly come from retail investors who go rogue and don’t follow conventional wisdom, go against their financial advisors advice, and sell off a significant chunk of equities?  I would think the retail investors I just described make up a very small percentage of retail investors.  And retail investors make up a small portion of the money invested.  

I think it would make much more sense that all the institutional investors would have to be the ones selling causing this massive drop.  

Now, would you rather model your trading/investing around people who do it for a living, or people who aren’t really sure how to check their 401k balance and probably don’t even know what they hold or how to sell if they wanted to?

Conventional wisdom allows average Joe’s to hold the bags, while the institutions sell early and buy back in once a support is found. 

Which investing strategy is best for you?  I think it depends.  If you literally watch your positions and follow markets daily, probably better to try and do what the pros do.  If you look at it once a month, you’d probably be late to sell and late to buy back in which case holding would probably be better. 

I cut my losses gradually and my lowest point was about 18-20% down from Feb highs.  I eased back in once it started to look safer.  I’m up about 60% on the year because of it.  Thats in an account where I just hold stock and sell covered calls.  I’ve got another account where I only trade options and was actively trading on the way up and down, and that account has only made 30% on the year. 

Moral of the story to me is, why the fuck should you hold something if you think it’s going to go down, and, if you can pick good stocks, that can also make money (not only options). 

Thank you, and have a Merry Christmas.  I digress.

Hey partner turn that frown upside down and buy yourself some long dated ICLN calls. Or a good therapist to help with your gambling addiction. But preferably both.
Started investing in September after talking to a friend and realizing I also wasn't going to need my down payment I had saved any time soon. Started with about 5k and soon after had put the entire 25k savings into stocks. Currently it's at about 29k, big winners were NIO, ENPH and my boy 🐝. I stayed away from day trading after a big fuck up with GME, which I eventually broke even on, realised I couldn't handle stress of it. I still check here and stocktwits daily just to stay in the loop, but I will rarely sell to buy something new these days.

Well fine sir, he is a billionaire, you are not. That should answer your question.

In case it didn’t, his millions of dollars he poured in will give him way more of a return than the thousands you can afford to put in, his risk vs reward is way lower than yours.

He also has money to live off of even if every stock he was invested in dropped to zero and got delisted.

In my opinion saying “a billionaire did this in the stock market I’ll emulate it” is the same as saying “if a pro mma fighter can knock someone out with a flying knee I should try it despite barley knowing how to throw a punch” 

Obviously I made a lot of assumptions about you and your finances in this post, I could be 100% wrong and a complete idiot for all you know.

When I was a restaurant manger on OSU campus at a 24 hour joint, we had hobos camping out front smoking all the time.. 

They would always harass customers for their leftovers as they left, but they really expected money.  If a customer would actually give them their leftovers instead, they would just throw them away, and pretend to be hungry again 2 minutes later. Fucking maddening.

Then we were short staffed, so I’d go out and offer them day jobs for cash under the table to do dishes.  I GOT TURNED DOWN 20/20 TIMES.

Bums don’t want to work, not even for 4 hours for $50 cash which was more than we paid most of our employees, but we were busy and I was desperate.

Never too late homie. Lotta ways to hustle out there just gotta find the one for you. This shit isnt magic. You cant just trust your gut and expect to win. At least not long term. Think of it this way. Some dudes on wallstreet pay billions to get a slight edge. You got gut feelings. Who do you think is gonna win in the end?
 but in the corona time not many people bought these stocks, you know what i mean.

Merry Christmas everyone! It certainly has been an unusual year in many ways.

If your Christmas is not so merry, whatever the reason, and you need to talk to someone, there is always the Samaritans. If you're in the US their number is  1 (800) 273-TALK, other numbers are just a Google search away.

Exactly.  You got this man.  I’m also really stoned so I’m not the best at explaining right now
>CCP wouldnt fuck over their most valuable company

They don't fucking care about stocks or the trust of Americans, the BABA net revenue isn't going anywhere even if BABA crashes to the floor. CCP will just reshuffle the entirety of BABA into their rival JD if it means getting full complete control. They kill off an entire city's economy to make sure the rest are safe, you think they won't kill off BABA to ensure the control of ecommerce market is in their hands????
So you're saying I should buy March calls rn?

This is an interesting thing to say. Why do you think it is stupid to pay for things up front? Is it because you’d rather yolo the cash and pay installments on the car? That’s a poor person move imo. 

My portfolio is almost 50% cash, and has been all fall. Bought my car cash, and paid off the house.  Sure, I could’ve made way more money  if I’d leveraged up and invested all of it, but it’s nice to have a cushion in case the bottom falls out. Allows me to take bigger risks with the money invested.
I hope someone tells you then we both will know

Look at Standard Oil Co. of New Jersey v. United States, how long did Rockefeller fought US for after the case ended in 1910s? Exactly, it still hasn't ended.

But unlike US, China will not let a rival faction keep holding power. It will end like what happened to HK. So 2022 is a sane prediction if we use Hong Kong as example(June 2019 - June 2020 when National Security Law passed)
Cuz God isn't real

Not really, they’re still genetically an identical plant. Just because one is tall and skinny and the other is short and fat doesn’t make them a different plant. Different phenotypes doesn’t change biological structure. 

And yes I agree cannabinoids play a major part in modulation but no where near as much as terpenes. The “ripeness” in the trichs you’re talking about is just oxidation and converting THC to CBN. People like to say it gives you a heavier high but it’s mostly a placebo. I’ve done several blind tests with my employees and none of them can tell a difference in even distilled CBN vs THC. Isolates are probably a different story
Sigh,

tl;dr:

don't buy the dip because this is not the lowest it will hit, INSTITUTES AND FUNDS are getting the fuck out because they aren't retards. You want to see results of Peak Capitalist vs Big Brother then go look at the history of US vs Rockefeller, nobody wants anything to do with that.

don't sell if you are already owning stocks because BABA's net revenue and source of income does not get affected by power struggle, it will recover back to 250 and beyond when the politics ends with a winner.

Always wanted to trade stocks but the cost of signing up with traditional brokerage firms turned me off. After finding out about Robinhood and Webull they were also a let down since they don’t operate in my country. Fast forward to this year I find out my brother in the states (pursuing his Masters) is trading stocks on Webull. I convince him to purchase some Tesla shares pre split, at the moment those shares have doubled. I also predicted that other EV stocks such as XPEV will also blow up due to Tesla. Also prompted him on PLTR when they listed back in September. After seeing all these stocks go up I urgently needed to get my own trading account. Then comes TD Ameritrade to save the day opened my trading account at the beginning of this month. Best part as a foreigner I think capital gains tax are paid on only dividends.

WTF do you mean “exactly?” This dumbass literally just proved my point lol.

I’ll put it in a way so you can understand:  when people buy up all the sneakers and start hoarding the rare models, you can’t just walk into a brick and mortar store like Foot Locker and buy them. They’re all gone.

Talk about next level retard, you both just agreed with me without even realizing it.
Missing PRPL
You’re close. Indica and sativa aren’t exactly a myth, but you’re correct that they don’t define the type of high, but rather the morphology - or shape - of the plant only. You can get a variety of effects from different plants of the same strain or even the same plant at two different times. Indica vs sativa is indeed mostly a marketing gimmick. 

Terpenes are not the “only modulator in cannabis,” but they definitely have an impact on the unique experience of each strain. There are other factors at play, primarily the ripeness of the trichomes (resin heads) at harvest, which affects the proportions of cannabinoids, terpenes, terpenoids, and flavonoids, etc. 

In general, the more ripe the trichomes when the plant is harvested, the heavier, stonier “indica” high and the less ripe the trichomes, the more heady “sativa” high.

>Time in the market beats timing the market.

Japanese stock market since 2000 : 👁👄👁
If he is the power then he would just pull a Stalin and remove Jack completely, the thing is it's not that simple. When Xi decreed himself as President for Life, it was essentially a declaration of war to Politburo. Lots of people died or completely disappeared from challenging Politburo, see his rival Bo Xilai, see what happened to The Gang of Four. Politburo is in shambles with one side supporting Xi while the other side supports the anti Xi faction, which is why it's a power struggle. Jack is on the anti Xi side, that is why you're seeing what you're seeing now.

Xi wants complete control and money all under him.

Anti Xi faction wants it to be like how it has been; make money and continue to make themselves richer and richer with properties and money spread all overseas so they can fuck off from China completely.

That's nuts.  So if someone were to lose $30k in total gains vs losses on a year, it would take them 10 years to apply their deductions?  And if they continued to lose every year (this is the way), they'd essentially never catch up on their potential deductions?  Asking for a friend.

5. Accept Jesus Christ

I was 19 and my dad told me about it in March and just ignored him, I did a little trading in June and stopped I was up $200. I came back in July and yolod my life savings (10.5k) in RH. 

I pussied out of every good play I had and did nothing until early august. Forgot what day it was but I was gonna buy tsla calls and my dad talked me out of it and I missed out on 24k so after that I said to never listen to him again and Trust my gut. I started following penny pumpers cause no matter what I never trust my gut no matter how right I am or know how stupid something is. 

Well, it’s august 11th, tsla is beat down and I said well it always recovers from dips and was gonna yolo everything I had into 1450 FD’s, of course I pussied out last minute and fomod into a penny pumper despite me knowing it was stupid. Lost like 1k overnight and seen what tsla did after they announced split and I said after today I need to start trusting my gut, of course it never happened. 

No matter how many times I told myself not to do it I fomod into everything they pumper called, lost like 75% in a week. But never believed in my plays that ran no matter how many times I was proved right. 

Throughout the month of august until now I have bought nothing and I’m down to my last $700 cause bills raping me, everyday I tell myself I’ll buy, I’ll trust my gut, and fight with myself etc, and nothing changes. My parents think I have my money still and I have not spoke to any friends in months. I never thought I’d let myself get this far down everyday since July 24th I wake up at 7 and watch the market until close and have done nothing but not trust my gut and it’s fucked me over. I threw away all my sports trophies and pictures, my graduation pictures and almost got rid of my diploma but couldn’t find it, any school certificates and miscellaneous medals and trophies. 

And I’m at my last leg of desperation, my dealer offered to buy my car back 15-18k and I’m gonna sell it. Deposit all of it in RH, turn on margin and start trading. I will either dig myself out of this hole or lose it all and Kill myself, no exceptions.

I could go on but there so much more to this I could make a little documentary

Zacks has it rated #4, Sell. Bad ratings for value (D) and growth (F). However, momentum is rated B, so there may be a chance for little pump before it keeps dropping.

Started in December 2019 as a curiosity. Began day trading a lot with mixed success until I started losing big. Underlying depression and anxiety fueled my obsession and I developed a gambling habit. My rock bottom was losing 5k on a 0 DTE SPX spread that I yolod, watched it all go down the drain. Do I regret my behaviors? Yes, but I actually felt alive for once. Currently down 30k all time, still battling severe depression and anxiety

I asked him if I push the exercise button to close the trade lol!  He told me to turn off the computer,  he was coming over.  I knew I was in some crap when I heard that.  Luckily for me, he dropped by on Monday morning open,  he asked me to take the loss,  I did,  1 grand,  he calculated what I would've lost and it was a lot more.  I have the pictures of the sell to close of 5 40c and two 35c.  He erased options trading for me.  I erased RH after that debacle.

Learned trading after I started travel nursing which doubled my income.  I got deeper into the Bitcoin rabbit hole started playing with alts and was up $42,000 when one of the shady trading sites I was on went dark and I ended up left with 5k. Said fuck it and traded most of that in for a sick mountain bike.  Walked away from trading for a couple years bc I saw how tied up my mental health was in it.  

Started buying tesla and Disney back in January but sold it when COVID hit.  I bought it back and I’ve made some gains.  Luckily my biggest gain has been with my salary since you stupid fucks won’t stay home/ isolate/wear masks so I have some spare change to throw into stocks and options.  We’ll see where this goes.

If Cohen is not satisfied, then his takeover plan made public will be bullish. He’s got a plan and I’m along for the ride.

Everybody hates on Sherman, but he’s been there less than two years. Most of the board has been replaced, with two old timers retiring next June. Changes are coming, and for GME, change is good.

Position: 15K shares.
it's a SPAC so options aren't available. Warrants resemble call options but I personally just invest in common shares for SPACs. Find a spac that trade's in the $10-20 range (big fuckin gain potential), has been listed for at least a couple months (you don't want to get in a SPAC that stays sideways for awhile), and strong indications of a likely merger. 

It's pretty hard to lose money in the current SPAC ecosphere imo. Is it a bubble? Who knows. Just don't get too greedy and hold a SPAC post merger or a situation like HYLN can occur where you hold and it falls, thinking it's a minor dip but nope. It keeps on falling to a point where you are now stuck with a highly skeptical business that you'll likely sell at a a loss for. Or the opposite can happen and rocket to the outer stratosphere (QS).

My first encounter was when I was 14 and my dad gave me a portfolio of shares in a bank and some other companies and Lennart & hauspie. 

The banks got hit by the financial crisis and l&h went bankrupt because they scammed everyone in Belgium.

Hated it and didn't look at it and earned good money with poker from 18 on while doing uni.

Now I'm in real estate and started with 30k buying shares again and spac stuff. Got in at 11 on thcplusb and goev and have 10k in ghiv thing.

To be fair the market for evs isn’t as big as everyone makes it out to be at this current moment. The Ev hype is predicated on the future and I think the legacy car auto manufacturers will have viable options in the coming years.

He also said he'd like Tesla, SpaceX, and the Boring company under one parent company. I think he included Starlink as well. Tesla already owns SolarCity and a dozen other companies.

6 months is 100 years for stocks. Just ask PLTR and TSLA
> are u fuckin retarded? 68 million shares are still sold short. the squeeze has not even started.

How recent is your data?
First off, I'm in my late 20s and ethnicity Mestizo (half Spaniard and Aztec). I've lived in Mexico for about 10 years when I was a young lad, so I know what it's like to not have as many opportunities as we have in our beautiful country the USA.

I started trading about 3 years ago while In was half way through my enlistments in the Marine Corps. I really can't tell you why, but I know it probably has something to do with the accessibility of trading, thanks to Robinhood. Maybe it was my increasing interest in crypto? I don't know, but I started with a few benjies and made no tendies. I was in it for the long run and bought regular ol' securities. I've never been a man of means by any means, so I think it pushed me to be creative and desirous of an education (I'm almost done with my bachelor's) and investments.

Anyway, I feel in love with trading because of $UBER; propagated by my love for $UBER, I even invested in $TSLA, $SHOP and $NFLX before their run-up but sold early for a measly profit instead of holding (still hurts to think about it). That mainly happened due to my inexperience. Plus, I wasn't actively lurking this subreddit and was more interested in crypto and Coinbase (fuck Coinbase). I spent way more time on 4channel's /biz/ than here.

I eventually decided to take all my money out of my TSP (military retirement or 401k equivalent) to YOLO on $UBER because I knew I had a good vision and thought $UBER was extremely undervalued. My initial large investment was about $15,000 and I eventually averaged down to a total of$25-30,000. I lost my mind when I saw all my tendies drain away because of the China virus but diamond handed it and eventually cut even.  I even made a few thousand after the recovery. Still, It was a depressing and sad time in my life to be down almost 50%.

$UBER entirely treated me right and I decided to dabble in some options. I went long on some $UBER calls which eventually increased my portfolio to a little over $50,000. I was elated and started day trading a lot more. After the announcement of $TSLA's inclusion to the S&P 500, I saw it increase by $50. That made me think that it would keep going because of the momentum and brand equity. I was right — I made $100,000 in about a week and my ATH was $178,000. Again, I got greedy and held when i should have sold due to my inexperience. I'm sitting at a comfy $90,000 with some really good plays. I mainly do monthlies and leaps. I'm currently 200% up and am still learning to stiff market makers'. We'll see what happens, but I really want a Cybertruck.

Merry Christmas, fellow autists. Now, I'm going back to sleep.

Tbh the no meeting strangers thing is a big one I think.

TSLA. Fully invested in shares in 2014, but share price didn't move despite a 6x in revenue. After Q3'19 financials it felt like the story was changing and we would see a correction similar to revenue growth.

Moved half my savings into TSLA options last November. Got lucky af. 100x-ed my account.

So the fed is purchasing bonds every day in the open market and i would imagine in a thin market with no sellers this would make the prices go way up....tlt calls until the new year sound like a good idea. I dont see why any big bond player would aggressively sell bonds next week to make up for all the buying. The volatility isnt high enough to worry about a big price drop. Stocks might get sold but bonds will either be held or bought by the fed.. it’s too late to sell anyway. Stocks are really expensive and the dollar is probably going to bottom soon no push foreigners back into us bonds. Plus there have been some pretty big buyers of tlt in the 4th quarter this year.. they cant sell a gain without a huge tax hit so they will either buy more if it goes down or ride it up...the euro is gassed so a lot of people will be switching back to dollars which will give our bondsa boost. There’s no reason to own European or Japanese bonds unless the currency is appreciating and it looks like its taking a breather.

Bad take. Read anything from people who actually understand the situation or read the state newspaper and you’ll know that the CCP doesn’t want to hurt baba really, just stop some monopolistic practices (that BABA really is doing, that wouldn’t fly in the US or EU either) and gain a little more control. All that translates to a relatively minor impact on revenues in the foreseeable future.

mate thank you so so much!!

so if i needed to do a weekly earnings statement, would i take the percent number at the end of the week and do the same process or would i have to do each day’s percent and then do that process?

also which percent are you referencing sorry? so like on a historical pepsi stock it says +0.65 (+0.45%). we’re talking about the parentheses one that follows the +?

also i appreciate this so much it’s a huge help to me really.

(i might’ve answered my own question! i take the weekly percent number each week till six weeks. you’re the best)

Hasn’t sold either
Take this as a lesson and keep pushing bro. I blew my account up from 10k and didn’t give up.
I got started in 2017 with beetcoin. I made a little money off of that ramp up and was hooked on the idea of trading ever since. I mostly traded crpypto and shares until this year where I started trading options. I made some dumb trades in April on OXY and was down 90% to about $200. Im back up now to 12k (thanks to NIO, TQQQ, and IPO mainly). 2021 Im either going to 120k or back to zero lol
I’m in deep on 1/15 $29 calls so 30s sounds like a decent idea

If you buy options *after* huge market moves, you are buying the options at an overinflated price. Unless you are buying the opposite of the market move. So, buying FD calls on baba would make some sense, but buying puts on baba today is like intentionally buying the peak.

Go to any source that has historical prices.  You can google “Sony stock price”
See where it was at six weeks ago, and you should be able to get a percentage it has been up or down.  If it’s up 23% you would just need to adjust your $100k by 23%.  And so on and so on.  Godspeed.

Holding for now. My stake is small enough that it isn't worth reducing at this time. Not taking action until some news comes out about how the investigation is going. Alibaba executives supposed to appear before the authorities in the coming days according to Al Jazeera.
Started in 2013 at schwab with $2500. Built a position with aapl and diamond held til this day. Icahn was a bitch for selling. I think his fund was going to shit so he had to sell. If he hadn’t, he’d have 10s of billions in profits. Built multiple other positions (Googl, amzn, cost, aapl, docu, v, schb, qqq). Port size now 1.5M. Mixed success with options but nothing like these beasts with 100k gains.

Cohen said he upped his stake, not going to up his stake. That means he already bought. The chance that he buys more is less likely than him trimming his position if it gets too high.

Similarly when company does a share capital raise they say they will sell. So stock drops huge. But after they said they sold already then it will go back up cuz they won’t sell anymore.

Life Pro Tip:  
Marry the daughter of a multimillionaire and then YOLO calls w her trust fund money.

If the marriage ends up in divorce, she's the rich one, so your downside is limited.
I made some dumb trades in April on OXY and was down 90% to about $200. Im back up now to 12k (thanks to NIO, TQQQ, and IPO mainly). 2021 Im either going to 120k or back to zero lol
BABA has financially ruined me but at least I still have you guys
He was the guy working the front when Dimebag got shot.
Lol that PLTR strong resistance is exactly why you should buy more. MMs (and so are shorters like Citron) try as hard as they can to dump the stock price so they can get in cheap. Eventually this thing is gonna blow (i has to because it is a solid company) and the big money will have to get in. PLTR 40$ in 2021 isn't fictional at all.
I’ve seen analysts endorse a stock and have a disclaimer that they don’t have any positions in it.  Now maybe their wife, friends, and son all have tons though...
I guess you are one of those guys you advise everybody here who have 100+ of any shares to start writing calls. Or buy some cheap ass shares, and write calls on them. Because theta gang is for smarties, and it can’t possibly go tits up.

I don’t want to be a jerk, and hope it ends well for you. But if not — please show this sub how exactly this shit can go tits up, and why writing calls is NOT free money...

He already had the show at that point. Viewer asked about bears liquidity problem and if they should pull their money out.
For some reason Cramer thought he meant pull his money out of his bank account (not the stock of bear). So he said that’d be fine and prolly get acquired. Then bear died like the next week.
i mean i AM happy that daddy powell and congress saved the credit markets and the economy, kind of
It won’t be veto proof if congress is not in session and he has not signed it 10 days after it passed (pocket veto). I am guessing he didn’t veto it, because then they could override his veto. This way he can just refuse an extension, they won’t be in session, and there we are.

If quick I been in and out of gme since April, it's definitely not as quick as PLTR or NIO or XPEV 

Gamestop just needs to be good at not sucking when it comes to gaming. Amazon has to be good at not sucking when it comes to everything.

If a shitty website can sell people packages of clothes monthly and moon, I'm sure with the right forward thinking mind and strategy GameStop can get out of that bad aura of ripping people off with used games.
I’d say GME because PLTR is deliberately being manipulated to not make it go past 30, you can clearly see it gets so many good news, contracts with various governments but somehow it never goes up (it does, but ends red at the end of every day), it just floats around 26/27.

GME had the catalyst necessary, it already went up a lot but it was deeply undervalued and if you believe in the squeeze or not, the new Ryan Cohen takeover might deeply change its foundamentals. I think that for the short term is a great play, it might be good for the long term too but I’m not sure if Cohen will actually be able to make GameStop survive and change

Positions or ban

Watched my dad make mad money and lose mad money off pets.com and all those meme stocks in the 2000 dot com bubble when I was 10. Figured the stock market is where the big bucks were made and when I got a job (not Wendy’s) I’d put it away in etrade or some other brokerage account.

Fast forward 10 years to the Great Recession where you could get houses and stocks mad cheap. Listened to my boomer parents to throw my spare 10k at blue chippers (safe, but slow ass growth) instead of...TSLA at $25, Bitcoin at $100, or some dilapidated shack in CA for sub 100k. Increased my portfolio, but definitely missed out on crazy gains. Didn’t dedicate any more time to stocks because I was in my 20s and loved getting smashed and going out with girls.

Brings us to 2020, got a wife and kid. Got the vibe down times were ahead because America can only take on so much winning, but goddamn did Corona speed things up. Didn’t invest in March because we were closing in a house, but once we got the keys played catch up in the market.  No options, just straight owning stock. Positions:

Winners
NKLA
NIO
PLTR
RMG...and DOGE (gainz is gainz)

Misses:
PENN
TSLA

Losers:
BA (lesson, never panic sell.)

Stop buying sky high premium options and start selling them.

If you're looking to grow your 100, diversify! This means that you shouldn't invest all in one stock or one sector. Additionally, do research. Look at Yahoo, Marketwatch, Nasdaq, Zacks, or whatever website you trust and get multiple opinions. It's good to go to the website of the stock and look at what they tell investors. Take messages from online commenters (even here) with a grain of salt. Any other advice depends on what type of trading you're doing. Do  you want to do day to day, week to week trading or hold for months to years?
This the wave?
Regardless how it feels - that’s a big balls play to be down 100k. Most people don’t know what that’s like. Like the others have said - there’s still 12k in that account. This will be a story you laugh about one day

We had some pretty bad wind at the beginning of the month that ripped down a power line on my street. Thought War of the Worlds was happening. Live, untethered electricity is fucking terrifying.
It's not inviting a loss on purpose, but to realize a loss. If you made $10k gains this year but have been holding another $10k position that's down and your don't expect it to recover in, your can choose to realize that loss in this year to offset the taxes you would need to pay on the $10k gain you made this year, rather than holding it until next year where your might not have gains to offset. Basically you're timing when to realize a loss, not purposely buying OTM FDs to generate a loss.

No, dummy. You have genuinely been incapable of grasping what I, and every other health professional has been saying. There is NO capacity for these rural hospitals to handle out-of-towners getting hurt. There is not a single bed available for serious injuries in some of these places. Meaning they’d have to fly anyone seriously injured hours away. Which equates to a tremendously reduced possibility of a positive outcome. 

I’m not even arguing wether or not going remote and camping reduces your individual potential exposure.

Started with 30k.  Got it to 40k after I learned about options. After that lost it all in a few days. Now I am minus 60k
heading into last friday, i had a $640 put spread on that i started sweating balls on, and was also short 2 $680 calls (in other words, I needed a close of between those two prices). It wasn't looking good in the morning so I decided to buy 100 shares in the afternoon at $678 thinking i could offset my losses when it rallies above $680 at close. that last 10 minutes was wild as it dipped below $650, down about $3k on the shares i picked up earlier.

i put in a sell order for the shares at $684 about 5 minutes before close for a hail mary, and watch the shit pump to close. initial closing quote was fucked up, showing $658 so yay, my call options will expire OTM.

but eventually gets adjusted to the auction price of $695 and my sell order's filled for a $1600 gain! but shit, now my short $180 calls are ITM, and i'll be down $15(00) on each one. take a look at the AH action, and the tsla selloff's already begun. i buy 200 shares at just under $678 expecting the short assignment. Saturday hits, and i'm forced to sell those shares for $680 (call premium being the profit)! granted, i could've waited until monday to pick up shares given the impending/continued sell off, but decided not to risk a stupid trump or musk pump.

drawing out this chart made me realize just how retarded moves can be in retrospect. enjoy!
Pick stock you believe in with decent iv and buy a deep itm leap and a few hundred shares then sell covered  call at like 30 delta or even more aggressive as well as csps and set limit buy to close on everything you sell at around 50% profit. Sell some weekly some monthly etc. Rollout your losses or just buy them back at a loss and keep selling

Weird, my company got investment and it enabled us to hire some staff. Laughably easy to disprove? Go for it. Imagine a world with no investments.

"Stock buy backs" are not investments. It's a company rewarding investors instead of spending profits on capital. A company can only do this for so long until their growth collapses. You need to acquire capital to grow a company. Who would invest in a company that doesn't spend on capital? 

If 70% of the economy is based on consumption, why do we care about taxing investors? We want investors giving our companies money.

Merry Christmas Beloved Retards!

I started Robinhood on dec 18 2019. My first trade was a Tesla call $1000 2/28 that I bought for $375 on 2/3 that netted me close to $20K. Dabbled in TSLA, NVDA, AAPL ... even in the mattress company PRPL on which I made some money. Now up to $150K with positions in PLTR, BTC, AAPL (paper handed GME and STIC for a small profit but might enter again).

Not if I can’t help it

I guess this is my play
This is not advice, but this is what I would do:

Long only, no fancy stuff. Keep adding shares if I get new money and only if the stock is still very cheap. If I'm afraid of downside risk, I don't use borrowed money to buy. 

I think this stock has a decent chance to reach 200 due to natural growth if Ryan gets control of the company. This may take many years to play out.

If squeeze happens and stock gets very high, I would sell a few percent to get my original investment back. The stock could reach much higher than people predicted when a real squeeze happens. So selling should be very slow.

Currently my largest position is still in TSLA, has been in that stock since 2012. Selling too fast can lead to regret. 

Probably sell 1 share after a double, then slowly sell if it goes much higher than that.
Pick a stock, and when I buy, it’ll go down, just let me know fam!
Still pay taxes on the position you sold before you got into your new position. 

Ex: I buy 100 shares of Apple at $90. I sell the 100 shares at $91. I made $100 and the $100 is my realized gains. Now I want to open a new position. I buy 100 shares of Microsoft at $90. I sell the 100 shares at $91. I made another $100 and have realized another $100. My total profit so far is $200. So you pay taxes on the $200 

Lets say you realized your apple gains but did not realized your Microsoft gains. Your total profit is only $100. So you would only pay taxes on $100 since you only realized your apple gains and not your Microsoft gains.
Still it would have mooned

always been interested in stocks, as a kid i would always watch the ticker that would scroll across the screen on the news. would ask about it but nobody could tell me about it (poor family).

flash foward, got a good job (trucker) hr set me up with stock options and a 401k...never bothered checking them (again didnt know anything).  one day i needed money, someone mentioned i could take it out my 401k. i went and checked and had WAY more money than expected.

after that i did all the research i could, audio books, youtube videos etc..  

started buying stocks maybe 3 years ago....randomly, even had a penny stock phase

i got good last year

then during the pandemic i learned to trade options.

found these sub, and now i am a fellow autist....!!!

im up 750% this year and will keep going.

what kind of work are you in? You have to hold for at least 30 days? You can always put in a limit order.

China is a mafia state that requires complete subservience.  Jack Ma will fall in line or they will take him and his company out.  China is not thinking on a 10 year timeline - they are looking to dominate the century.  They can manipulate and create anything at this point, Alibaba can be replaced, easily and quickly.  What they cannot replace is the dominance of the CCP, it can never be questioned and never be cracked.

I'm not OP but i guess his conditions to execute a trade are BREAKING the cloud and maybe BREAKING the 50 EMA aswell. In that 11:10 case neither of those things happened and also the cloud did not go from RED to GREEN hence not signalling a trend change.

 gather around it’s story time.

ANT financial did P2P lending. However, they had this corrupt system where they exaggerated your credit so it made it seem like you were credit worthy.... except literally nobodies (no job no education and like 18) could get like 20-30k USD lent to them from other people who thought they were good for it. Pretty much as long you downloaded the app and signed up you got 20-30k. People started gaming the system by making multiple accounts and racking up 100k USD in debts with no way to pay it off. Then the cracks started to show when people started YOLOing this money into the stock market and losing it. Then the Chinese government had to step in and stop it. There’s rumours floating around right now that Alibaba needed the IPO to cover this massive hole they’re hiding because they had to cover some of this debt themselves. 

Nearly every single “young” Chinese person is carrying debts right now because of what Jack Ma did and he has the balls to blame the government.

Bro if Jesus was still alive he’d want the market to be open on Christmas Day. Jesus didn’t die for our sins to have YOLOing options paused for a day.

GME had a little pop because of the new consoles but everyone buys games almost exclusively online now and their business model is failing. Actually buy puts on GME for a few years out from now and you will make money. I don't see the company lasting another decade.

Hey thats my name!
Overall, I agree with your frustration. But to offer a counter point, the communities surrounding most of the remote places people want to go camp have an extremely limited health care infrastructure. It doesn’t take many people to overwhelm their ICU and emergency departments. 

You may feel more comfortable out there, but enough people doing that same thing and those communities get screwed harder. And in the perhaps extreme off chance you did need emergency medical help, they’d no longer be able to provide it. 

In fact a lot of those places in CA right now are already at 100% ICU capacity. Try not to take it personally

Only shareholders can sell Calls. Every 100 shares can sell one covered Call. It's a very limited supply. Most shareholders don't sell Calls. 

There are dumb people/companies who sell naked Calls. They will be squeezed the hardest when stock rallies. So basically they sell $2k worth of Calls, later they could end up on the hook to pay $5m.
Congrats on your new found poor status. Dont think about all the tesla model 3s you could have bought, instead think about how its christmas and a time to spend with family and loved ones.
That's interesting because these were day trades and I know day traders pay 40% tax instead of 15-20% tax that people who hold stocks for more than a year pay. I guess I'll have to call turbotax and ask.

**[Dexamethasone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dexamethasone)**

Dexamethasone is a type of corticosteroid medication. It is used in the treatment of many conditions, including rheumatic problems, a number of skin diseases, severe allergies, asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, croup, brain swelling, eye pain following eye surgery, and along with antibiotics in tuberculosis. In adrenocortical insufficiency, it should be used together with a medication that has greater mineralocorticoid effects such as fludrocortisone. In preterm labor, it may be used to improve outcomes in the baby.

Look the only ignorant one here is you.

I know you haven't faced austerity because you wouldn't have the opinions that you have. I highly recommend you to actually talk to people who have faced austerity. The problem with modern socialists these days is that they grew up with privileged lives, and they think everyone should live the life that they grew up with. There's a clear disconnect from reality.

"Never said that, but nice straw man".

You implied it, the strawman isn't that off base. I said the poor is not entitled to luxuries... You took issue to that by claiming I hate the poor. Luxuries would be things like what I listed there. Do you, or do you not think the poor is entitled to those luxuries? Do you think if you're poor, that you should be spending money on video games? Expensive real estate in New York / California? Cars? New phones? 

You'd be surprised how much money magically appears once you take your finances seriously.

My first trading story....

I bought a debit spread  - buy 1 call sell 1 call 

And a butterfly option buy 1 call sell 2 calls and buy 1 call 

But because it was the same date 

Both options combined so I ended up with 3 sold calls and 1 bought call it was ugly 

The risk is unlimited so my account couldve gone negative I didn’t know how to exit the position either  I réalized i had to sell everything separately because it didn’t give the option to close thé whole positon together 

While quickly rushing out i even hit 3 Day trades so I was nearly double fucked PDT 🤣 

Lost $1000 in the process 

Moral of the story 

be careful dont do options 

That was the moment I fell In love with options and made sure from then I Knew what was doing. 🚀🚀

I always feel like as someone who is heavily into ARKG and bought calls on ICLN that I am somehow the conservative 'safe' investor when i come to WSB despite the fact those are still quite risky in the broader financial scheme. Most of my money is in ARKG, ARKW and ICLN because I believe they'll crush it down teh road at prices that are much much higher than what we have now. 

I like your distinction though, makes a lot of sense. The part I get stuck on is something like PLTR. I've followed this company for the last 4 years, long before IPO. Got in early and believe in them long before the Meme train. Am I gambling or investing though?

Thats one side. But the real truth is that divorces can get messy and sorting assets outs during a divorce makes things even more messy.

If your relationship is real you can communicate and figure this out without manipulation

Does anyone else think it’s kind of sad that we’re all posting here early Christmas morning?
can't blame you-- that day was crazy. heading into friday, i had a $640 put spread on that i started sweating balls on, and was short 2 $680 calls (in other words, I needed a close of between those two prices). It wasn't looking good in the morning so I decided to buy 100 shares in the afternoon at $678 thinking i could offset my losses when it rallies above $680 at close. that last 10 minutes was wild as it dipped below $650 and now i'm down about $3k on the shares i picked up.

i put in a sell order for the shares at $684 about 5 minutes before close for a hail mary, and watch the shit pump to close. initial closing quote was fucked up, showing $658 so yay, my options will expire OTM.

but eventually gets adjusted to the auction price of $695 and my sell order's filled for a $1600 gain! but shit, now my short $180 calls are ITM, and i'll be down $15(00) on each one. take a look at the AH action, and the tsla selloff's already begun. i buy 200 shares at just under $678 expecting the short assignment. Saturday hits, and i'm forced to sell those shares for $680! granted, i could've waited until monday to pick up shares given the impending/continued sell off, but decided not to risk a stupid trump or musk pump.
Who would buy a $250 call with only days left when the stock is at $230? Let’s put it this way, there’s a reason you want to sell it 🤣

Merry Christmas guys and gals!
SMH you can’t pick and choose which WSB plays to inverse. All or nothing
Played around with some calls and puts In my freshman year of college where I lost about 2K. Then after that during my junior year I decided to try up options again in March when everything was just starting to go down. I later learned about wsb, and followed the train where I would yolo spy puts daily for free tendies (Man I miss those -10% days). Anyway I turned 300$ into 15K in the span of a month and thought I was some kind of god. Well I guess I was a bit too gay and kept betting against America even when the trend reversed and lost it all. I took a break to focus on my studies and still lurk but recently I have more cash and came back with the lesson I learned regarding the trend is your friend and stocks only go up lol
As the price comes down there's no reason not to include lidar in a computer vision ai as another sensor in addition to cameras perhaps. Honestly it's an amazing feat of engineering what Tesla managed to do with cameras and AI alone. If they add a few lidar sensors in their vehicles will probably be hella safe. Personally would feel much safer knowing a bad ass lidar sensor is also included. Engineering for safety = redundancies. Cameras can see things lidar can't and vice versa

Good choice on the Codexis! I made 68% gains, and took profits on my position. Unless my options bets net me significant gains I will kick myself for selling my 130 shares of Codexis with a cost basis of $11.60

Same. I cannot hold anything short dated over 100% gains over night.
Normally GME would be a standard fight, it could go either way. With Ryan in the picture, the odds strongly favor the long side. Any shorts who stays short is pure idiot.
Started back in the 2008 Financial crisis, kept buying and selling etrade stock timing dead cat bounces based on fed announcements. Dumb strategy but was up 30% when I stopped and bought a mutual fund...the fund lost 50% in a year. I dabbled in a few stocks here and there for a while but was broke bagging groceries for a living with a 4 year degree.

Got a job in finance in 2011, bought some individual stocks that were still undervalued here and there. Tried letting a firm manage the money but it cost too much for the value. Now I use a Vanguard ETFs but place 1-3% total portfolio value bets on individual stocks and let them run. Used FAANG for a while with solid returns. Doubled my money on Roku way back...should not have sold it at 60. In the last 5 years I'm up 125% vs sp500 96%. Only 345% Tesla gains from 10 shares.
 I'm not permitted to trade options but got lucky and bought 200 shares of PLTR at $9.54 right before I started paying attention to this sub. Funny to watch but I'd never YOLO...aggressive growth but no rampant speculation. 
Total assets in 2009 3k...as of today 236k. 
Yeah I'm that boring buy and hold a few years at least guy...but I'm likley to retire at 59 with 1.3 million.
So we tanked on news of just a $600 stimulus. I guess now that we have a $0 stimulus, and no tax break for horse owners, we will moon Monday.

Look at GME, if you actually did research, this is not a stock to buy.

If you were retarded and did FOMO on GME, you are now rich.

in WSB world, just buy the hype and once people start posting crazy gains, get out.  GME and TSLA just keeps going though, not sure what to make of that.

Now that I have more experience trading, I’m realizing that had I already been in the market in Feb / March this year, and if I had somehow owned a bunch of puts, I probably would have paper-handed them on like, day 2 of the crash and taken profit.  No way would I have held until March 23rd

Give me some cheese and pretzels because I'm fucking retarded and don't know the difference
Human body is the most complex thing on this planet. There is no way it will be replicated in any sort of machinery or computer modeling.
This year around a few days before the crash. I don’t know if I just saw something on the news regarding said crash or what but I had this urge to want to start a portfolio. 
Took about a month before I was actually approved to begin trading and put in $300 in a few Delta and AMD shares. Sold those for a minor profit. 
And during that time a lot of posts from here would pop up occasionally in popular for me as I browsed so I’d lurk around confused about what it was about. The memes really drew me in though. 
Learned about options and lost all of my gains. Until recently when I saw the DD post of PLTR while it was at $15. I said fuck it and deposit what I had in my savings to buy shares and leaps. 
Aaaand. Now we’re here. Got $2k profit so far so that’s kinda cool. Still holding onto those calls even though they’re not as strong as that initial bull run. 🚀🚀🚀 (rockets added because this is WSB after all.)
Don't hog it all!
cool to hear. I'm new to this and trying to find sources on how to actually learn to trade instead of that billionaire mindset bs pedaled everywhere on socials. could you point me in any direction to start learning man?

I discovered wallstreetbets back during the ironyman saga. I didn't know what was happening and wsb sure as hell wasn't going to tell me, so I did some reading and learned about options. Put $500 in a RH account and promptly lost all but $150 on shitty otm calls. I was intrigued at that point, though, so I did some more reading, discovered spreads, and traded $150 up to $2k. Then the corona crash and subsequent recovery happened and I wiped my account as I failed to acknowledge the trend in both cases. At that point I decided directional trading was not for me--it was stressful as fuck and discussing me from my job, but at the same time I just couldn't leave it all bring now knowing about what you could do with options. Did some more reading, learned about theta strategies. Since then I've been running a directionally neutral theta strategy (not on RH obviously) that I have revised 3-4 times, and I'm finally making consistent gains and sleeping well at the same time. But it took a ton of research. I still spend time trying to learn more and analyzing past performance in order to slowly get better. And every step where I learn something new and improved my trading is incredibly gratifying. It's been a ton of fun from the start

Up 50% since and almost at 50k

Do you think the poor should be given PS5s, lambos, large single flats in Manhattan, and new IPhones or what? 

Man you have some fucking privilege to think that all people should have an entitlement to these kinds of things. You have never faced austerity in your life.

Poor isn't a constant state. Poor isn't an identity. All you need is a roof over your head and food in your mouth. You can achieve this with very little money if you actually try to. The next step is to acquire skills to get a better job or if you already have those skills, you spam apply until you get that job. 

Also, I'm not wealthy. I make due with what I have. I'm building a company from the ground up using skills I have learned by taking the time and money to learn them. I have sacrificed a lot to get where I am today. So when you tell me that the poor are unable to sacrifice it doesn't surprise me... That's why they're poor to begin with. If you're born to poor parents, your job was to literally just not be a total fuck up with your studies... You can get student loans to fund all of your education and move to the middle class... Just get a useful education...

Sure, we had risky plays but there were so many constant and great DDs, now this has become a meme fest and karma whoring posts are abundant.

Your paying for the experience more than the commodities. People want to look forward to that one day a month when the box comes in, you bring it into the kitchen, and your dog just absolutely loses their shit. The pup does the happy dance because they know the box is the snack box and the owner takes joy in knowing they did something to make their pet so happy.

Also a monthly toy, especially for a bigger dog, is next to nothing. My mom's dogs tear through any toy in about a week or 2, and the ones that survive that are just disgusting. I'm sure she would like a service that made her fur babies get all super excited and allowed her to replace disgusting drool stained toys on a regular basis without having to think about it. 


We're talking about the demographic of people who buy pet CBD oil to help with their daschund's anxiety. They are *all about* excessive shit for their pets.

I agree GME is a great long term investment regardless we have a squeeze or not. This is the reason why I keep adding shares. 

I went through Herbalife squeeze, Overstock squeeze, and Tesla squeeze (twice). I'm more sure about GME than the previous three cases.

I just slowly add shares. If shorts try to bully the stock, I will add faster.  If squeeze, the stock will reach higher than most people thought. GME shares outstanding 69.75m. float 49.42m. Total short shares 67.98m. This could squeeze to crazy level.

My approach is keep adding shares, never sell shares, never sell covered calls. Occasionally (during pullbacks) buy small amount of long term calls. By the time shorts try to exit, it will be too late for them.

What is strong now usually gets stronger despite the contrarian in us. Be patient and buy at pullbacks to the moving averages depending how bullish you are 10, 20, 50 daily chart moving average. 20 ema my method
If I read the filings correctly, the lockup period will allow insiders to sell 253M+ shares. 253M shares today would be worth almost 7B dollars but I don’t think everyone will sell all at once, but lockup periods always cause a significant dip in the spot price. And the magnitude of the drop? I’m not quite sure myself.
You  give homeless people  cash? I just give him the crack so it’s either our amazing day and reflect on the accomplishment or he’s a cop and a potentially life-ending loss and reflect how we lost just about everything in an avoidable poor choice.

You do realize that 70% of the US economy is based on consumption and buying stocks is not "consumption."

Also, it's laughably easy to disprove that buying stocks creates jobs. After the US corporate tax cuts, the massive stock buybacks were not followed by massive hiring.

Again dude, you’re thinking of the slums. You can be the king of street shitting and probably a maharaja of a large area full of people in the bottom of the caste. There are only a few good places with good healthcare providers nearby and 150K isn’t enough to live the rest of your life off the quality you are seeking. The rest of India is literal jungle dude.

Incorrect. GME has no reason to go bankrupt. You could argue that new game revenue will slowly decline to near 0. But their resale (trade-in) business alone is profitable enough to exist freestanding if they pivot it to an online model. Not to mention all their hardware sales...

Well, one thing shorters do is cover to take profits and with enough of them, it helps to slow down a drop. With the way every minor drop is bought up almost instantly though, not too surprising to see the drop in shorters.

No, you won't make money if it rallies to $230. IV is gonna crush you.

Not really, the share price doesn't matter, they're caped by the amount of money they receive, not the amount of shares they sell. So if the share price is $420, they sell $100 million worth of those shares, and if the price is $69, they sell $100 million worth of those shares. The only difference is the number of shares sold, because the lower the price of the share, the more of them would be added to the float. 

The price of the share is totally is irrelevant for that shelf offering, therefore it has nothing to do with the short squeeze potential.
Bro what?? Even if it rallies to 230s I still make $$? Or is it tanking more

The hardest lesson in stock trading is when to hold and when to let them go. You have to never fall in love with a trade and always trust your gut. Typically it always pays to hold - because you made that specific play for a reason. But in that, you have to know when to let go of a losing trade. I got lucky here.
Nah this is a China we’re talking about. Baba can’t dare be more rich and powerful than the gov of China. It’s a high risk high reward play. However I agree it’s tempting but I’ll prob sit this nice dip out.
Good buy. It’s not as hot these days as it used to be, I think it’s lost some market share the last few years but at one point 90% of base pairs sequences were done by them. Might be worth looking into their competition and changes in market share and positioning tho. IMO Illumina is to genomics what Intel is to semiconductors and chips. They’re the big boy player but you might want to buy an AMD instead (most likely Roche)

I started with a few thousand and doubled it on the first play.  Then lost most then stopped trading for a few months then threw $10k in then $10k more then $20k more then put kore and more in, now have $55k in Robinhood but started with $71k,  down $16k all time. 

Have only been positive in my account twice in two years.  First time was the second day, second time was Sept 2020 when I was up $20k all time. Sept 2nd-3rd I lost $35k and almost got margin called.

But right now shits printing, and I need this to set my life up so it doesn't suck to fuck awefully in future, grabbing these gains.

Depends on the state you get married on what happens in the divorce. If you are truly worried about your net worth being lost just set up a shell business and funnel money into it.
Bc the type of people that own them/ buy them new usually have negative net worth

Edit: Same goes for a lot of cars. The people that can barely afford them, trash them to shit before one of us gets to it
ya know im wondering the same thing but I bought 50c instead and just kept my 25c
This guy looks like he can read. 

He's leaps and bounds in front of me screening a good market play.
Clearly the op is talking about gold diggers. Hide your wealth before getting married and if thing start to go south liquidate it and transfer it to a sibling. Open a shell company and stash your cash there.  But let be real non of us got shit worth protecting.

It’s January 4th you wake up at 6:30 am PST. The light outside is slowly brightening the room as the sun rises. Gme has been trading side ways for the past week. It’s at $21.00 a share at market close Friday. 

You open the app. The market opens. You see green dildos. +100%. GME $42. You rub your eyes and sit yourself up adrenaline and dopamine getting pumped through your veins. $63 + 200%. The room is getting brighter. Color is starting to illuminate your life. You can’t believe what is happening. GME paused. You pace around the room. Open up Reddit. All top posts are rockets and moon emojis followed by GME. You see people from across the world posting videos, popping open champagne. You hop into WSB discord 200 people in the main channel moaning “moooooon baby”. GME trade opens again +300%, 400%. You’re now panicking. When’s the top when’s the top??? +500%, 600%, 800% the discord is just one giant orgy of moaning. “Diamond hands” you hear chanting in the channel through the orgasmic moaning. GME 1256 a share. You have just cummed your pants. You feint from lack of semen in your body. You wake up. Market closed. You look at the day graph. It’s huge but gme final price? $20 a share. -1% for the day. You didn’t sell. 

You go to work. Make Wendy’s burgers. The color in your life is back to grey scale. You keep telling yourself that wasn’t the real squeeze it will happen again.

I remember u/vitocorlene saying 8 weeks from now we're basically gonna lose our shit.

Fine.
BABA bulls are grateful for the pause in the slaughter. I believe this sell off is over done and this holiday season we will realize that even if the Chinese government is turning its back on BABA, there is nearly no impact on the financials and sales of this company. If BABA drops any further consider its a Christmas miracle for those who choose to buy more.
Shorts will keep shorting, price will keep climbing. Life is good, gains are secured.
Yea that along with IV are really the keys for option pricing.

You’re forgetting the key: How many 🚀 emojis are at the end of the DD.

If there’s none, it’s a boring boomer stock that won’t make you anything worthy. A single one either means it’s going to be a 10-bagger or stagnate and theta fuck you. Two is a myth, and probably means it’ll dump the moment you buy in. Three means the stock has already pumped 50% or more before you even read the DD and now you missed the window. Four is guaranteed gains. Five+ means OP is trying too hard and it’s a clear pump and dump.

I’m not on that train so can’t give much advice but I can give an observation. The company historically is very cyclical and dependent on console releases. You can see it in the stock history. Also many brick/mortar shops are taking the pandemic as an opportunity to close unprofitable stores without disgruntling shareholders too much. I think the upcoming quarters will be incredible for GME, short squeeze speculation aside. IMO if you’re going to sell , wait until they report amazing earnings and sell into that strength

Seems like lots of folks fall into the dividend trap when they start.  I wasted so much of my time buying that boomer shit.  I thought if I bought enough I wouldn’t have to work anymore.  Cause I’m a retard and lazy.  Of course none of those stocks had any upside so they either stagnate or fall.

TSLA can make an 5 billion offering and stock up 2%. I think PLTR can weather the beach house find sell off.
That's hillarious and troubling. When idiotic stuff like that works, you know some deep structural tectonics could shake the flimsy foundations upon which this whole artificially propped financial pyramid we call the stock market is built upon.

That’s awesome man. When you bought them, did they dip? How far? Did you add? What was your signal to take the calls? Sorry I am just learning how to play options as they all trade differently so want to learn as much as possible. The hardest part is managing a trade. I am very impatient and have weak hands but want so badly to be able to pull these plays off as I see them on the charts.

YUM will do anything except improve it’s garbage food. All YUM needs to do is retool it’s production and recipe and people would return to KFC. It’s as easy as that. The brand awareness is there, it’s just that the offerings are terrible even by fast food standards.

For that reason, I am not investing in YUM. A company that is so stupid that it would invest in a Rom Com and computer instead of improving its core product is too autistic to spend my money.

I’m new to the market and am here to get ideas on what to do and what not to do. I started trading December 1 with an amount that I am comfortable with losing, the idea being that I’m likely going to do something completely retarded and lose it all. Thus far am up 64% (mostly on calls) but have not jumped on any of the WSB gravy trains. Trying to train myself against the FOMO of that and against getting so confident with a 64% return that I’d dump a lot more into the market before I have a stronger grasp of what the fuck is going on.

ICU s in Florida are not at capacity with Coronavirus patients and neither is my hometown in the Mideast. And you’re wrong about the deaths. Deaths in Florida have flattened out and are not rising. I’ll help you out. You can google “Florida coronavirus deaths” and it’ll give you a nice little dumbed down graph that even you can understand. As a result, the Florida economic situation is not as bad as other parts of the country. Now I’m gonna bury my feet in the sand and count my gains and you can go jerk off to Kamala Harris

TITLE: Vaccine Boosters Could Be Needed 153 days after second dose.

**Microbiology PHD estimates there have already been 100k reinfections**

>In actuality, there are most likely around 50,000-100,000 reinfections in the world, excluding asymptomatic first or second infections which may not have been caught on either screening.[[0]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kj6f2s/observational_study_on_healthcare_workers/ggv298c/)

Reinfections are common given the opportunity [[1]](https://www.reddit.com/r/news/comments/khsw6u/scientists_urge_concern_not_alarm_over_new_virus/ggo8qir/). Reinfections can be used to estimate anti-body half life for anti-bodies created by the vaccine. [[2]](https://medical-dictionary.thefreedictionary.com/antibody+half-life). Reinfections can also be used as an indicator for B cell immunity, as B cell immunity created via an infection is the same as B cell immunity created by a vaccine. [[3]](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html). **Reinfections indicate anti-body half life is short and B cell immunity is weak**. This implies booster shots are needed but bi-annual vaccine boosters are not logistically feasible.

Antigenic drift can reduce efficacy rapidly. Its not possible to vaccinate for multiple versions bi-annually. [[4]](https://twitter.com/trvrb/status/1340409968818671616?s=20). "Immune Evasion" can already be seen occuring in the South African strain [[5]](https://sciencespeaksblog.org/2020/12/22/covid-19-south-african-variant-may-be-worse-than-uk-variant/). Suspiciously, there are also 1594 untested and suspected cases in fda report for pfizer vaccine, in vaccinated group. [[6]](https://www.fda.gov/media/144245/download). 

**The Moderna Vaccine’s Antibodies May Not Last As Long As We Hoped**

>A significant determinant of vaccines’ effectiveness in controlling a pandemic is antibody duration—how long the antibodies last in a person’s system. [[7]](https://www.forbes.com/sites/williamhaseltine/2020/12/22/the-moderna-vaccines-antibodies-may-not-last-as-long-as-we-hoped/)

**A Prospective Study on Rapidly Declining SARS‐CoV‐2 IgG Antibodies Within One to Three Months of Testing IgG Positive**

>**Conclusions**
>Our findings show that the protective COVID-19 IgG antibodies rapidly decline over one to three months. Rapidly decaying protective IgG antibodies would impact herd immunity and vaccine durability. It is critical for the potential vaccines to generate both protective T- and B-cell immune responses in a sustained manner. [[8]](https://www.cureus.com/articles/46453-a-prospective-study-on-rapidly-declining-sarscov2-igg-antibodies-within-one-to-three-months-of-testing-igg-positive-can-it-lead-to-potential-reinfections)

**Anti-body half life can be determined from the following equation.** [[10]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Half-life)

>Nt = No × (0.5)  ^ (t / thalf)

>10 = 100 × (0.5) ^ (90 / thalf)

>0.10 = (0.5) ^ (90 / thalf)

>ln(0.10) = ln(0.5) × (90 / thalf)

> thalf = (90 × ln(0.5)) / ln(0.10)

> thalf = 27 days

A vaccine would provide up to 4 times the initial anti-body count as a natural infection. 

**Re-run the equation to find how long it would take for anti-bodies, provided by a vaccine, to drop below the critical threshold.**

>10 = 400 × (0.5) ^ (t / 27)

> ln(0.025) = ln(0.5) × (t / 27)

> t = (27 × ln(0.025)) / ln(0.5)

> t = 143 days

Stonks fall fast. Spy 315p 6/9/21 (Fauci's expected booster date)

**TL;DR**: Anti-body half life is short. B cells immunity is weak due as indicated by reinfections (100k estimated). Vaccine boosters needed ~143 days after second dose (+10 to 12 days to reach max anti-body count), or bi-annually.

>Bonus Points: The 100k reinfection estimate sourced from a PHD in Microbiology / Immonology AND is also in charge of ordering bootser shots [[9]](https://www.reddit.com/r/Coronavirus/comments/kj6f2s/observational_study_on_healthcare_workers/ggv4kmm/)

Santa's bringing lump sums King.
Why would someone do this
Tommy gun go BRRRRRAAATTT
Got a free RH reward stock of ADT from their reward, sold for $5.35 in March, that's the end of my RH story until late September. Started an E-Trade account in April and only put in $300 and left most of it cash for a while. First stock was CCL, sold for a few bucks of profit, figured airlines were more likely to bounce back so bought those (<$200 worth), which was a beginner "mistake", but still up 61% on those so I can't and won't complain (SAVE & UAL). After that was learning about ETFs, bought 3 shares of IUSG and a share of SPYG to just see what would happen long term. From then until August I bought up a couple more things (literally <$400 worth) while doing youtube "research" and paper trading with thinkorswim. Once I make a few mistakes with the paper trader I buy into the ETFs because they seem to be doing well with minimal effort. This is right around the time that SoftBank did their thing so I pretty much bought at the "top", but the primary goal of ETFs is to be passive so I let that shit sit there and it's doing as good as you'd expect. The immediate downturn though led me to dive into options since I didn't need to be directional with those based on everything I was learning. My first real options trade wasn't until late September with my RH account. I used RH simply because they let me, and because they are commission free. The first trade was a TSLA call credit spread -500c/+505c. Since then I've made \~90 trades (mostly credit spreads) and made \~$3000 on my RH account alone. Anyway, if you're still reading this thanks for listening, I appreciate your time and to make it up to you, I make a few extra bucks from reverse split arbitrage which is publicized on twitter via  "@ReverseSplitArb"

Vaccine doesn't work, bro. That's why they are pushing the (old) news about multiple strains. Market gonna crash next month when they report  the vaccine isn't effective on the "new" strain. They've known about  these strains for months, you really think they haven't tested the  vaccine against it in the lab? Use your brain. That new strain is  widespread in the UK. That Astrazeneca vaccine was trialed in the UK.  Why do you think their vaccine only tested 60-70% effective and then had  to go back for more testing? Cause half of the patients probably had  the one strain (where it's 95% effective) and the other half had other strains where it's only \~45% effective. That's why they had wacky  results where a small subset got a 'half dose' and was 90% effective. Cause the small subset just happened to have the one strain that was the more effective strain for the vaccine. Newsflash, a half dose don't raise efficacy, we all know it, that's why they had to retest.

Yes you sure can. You are just responsible for collection and maintenance of property.

Echelon Corp?
I think the Fed said they'll keep interest rates where it is at least for all of 2021. 

2023 expiration, I'm sure rates will go up by then.
You should add IPO to your list of stop words. There's also a library to get all tickers
This is the actual way
I’ve seen options on larger stonks (not AMZN or TSLA large) have a spread of .60 or slightly more without warning you which would give the example that the OP presented of spending .25 (or more) more than the lowest bid per contract. Kindly get bent and go to bed lil man. Again, Merry Christmas douchebag
I didn’t bought Puts on February because I thought Rona won’t effect stonks because stonks were overpriced at the time and there’s talks that there won’t be any recession because there’s the Fed.

Also, I didn’t know about Puts and calls at the time. I could’ve had 10,000% gains if I only know about Puts and calls. I started knowing about this sub on May, checking the top posts....

Before knowing this sub, I thought buying shares was the only way to make tendies.

How did I become profitable?

I’ve never become profitable yet. Been 4 years now and I wish 2021 will be the first profitable year..

Moving forward, I believe stonks will only go up, any dip is a buying opportunity because of the Fed. There’s no way Fed will normalize rates because we can’t afford interest payments, rates should be at 0. We will be up on dollar terms but I don’t think on real terms
You ain’t shit. If you think that’s special or some sort of extra exciting life then wow.

It’s simply incredibly incredibly difficult and expensive to build miles and miles of vacuum tube. There’s no crazy innovation needed. It’s a fairly straightforward engineering problem, one that has been proposed since 1904 in various forms. The air pumps and seals needed just push it way beyond practicality. It’s total vapourware and should be called out whenever possible. Just look at the ‘test track’ that’s been built. It’s a joke. 

I like what Tesla have done with cars and batteries. But the fact he continues to push the hyperloop is deeply troubling to me because only one the two can be true:

1. He actually thinks it’s viable and will become a reality and will continue to pour cash into a giant black hole.
2. He knows it’s completely unviable and is lying to everyone

Here's a big tip.
Buy penny stock companies that have similar name/ticker as a big boy IPO or private company.
Example 1 - ZOOM that was a wild ride. The OTC company changed their ticker to ZTNO. 1 to 20$ 
Example 2 - Lucid diagnostic got confused a Lucid electric motors went 0.36 to 6.4

Literally can't go tits up if you get in before the megatards.

I suspect a lot of limit buys happened at $20, a lot of dip buyers concentrated around that price point. It did actually go all the way down to 19.96, but only briefly before hopping back to 20.1  


Not as solid as that 22 wall, but solid enough for my own confirmation bias XD

Yeah, I was also confused. Didn’t know you could do a market order for options
burden of proof lies on you to show that the short squeeze already happened. obviously it hasn’t, wondering if you even know what a short squeeze is. By the way, it’s massive short coverings which causes the price to skyrocket. That obviously has not happened as the shares sold short is still at 68 million. 

Yeah i’m confident, so confident that im all in on GME, why don’t you shut your mouth and buy some puts? pussy ass bitch

The TLDR: Random health data company going to have a slight earnings beat.

Biggest question: Why would you post all of this? 

Recap: you work at Cerner, you are on a first name basis with the CFO, you don’t know the chief transformation officer as well, you’re not sophisticated enough to know that AlixPartners does turnaround work for pretty much everyone, you still think it’s funny to make fun of board members... and you’ve also shared that you’ve shorted your own fucking company in the past.

I was investigating this company since like August/September of this year, before I even realized WSB is heating up around it. It's a deep value buy, meaning you pay less for it than it's truly worth, even now.

Then there's a giant upside potential in 2021 with both the console cycle, which historically causes the price to ramp up, combined with Ryan Cohen, an activist investor who seems more and more determined to take the reins and remove the half-competent boomer Board of Directors and make this the Chewy of gaming.

The short squeeze stuff... I wouldn't think about that,  it's a highly unlikely theoretical scenario. What's more likely is a slow burn, gradual increase in price over the longer stretch of time.

Something like TSLA, which also had a retarded high short interest at one point and then it just started going up, slowly and steadily, and look where it is 1 year later...

Lowkey swear doordash has longer delivery times then postmates. Also, doubtful doordash can maintain this high of a stock price. As you said above, \*lock down will keep its business growing\* Once this all blows over and the restaurant industry can somewhat return to a normal standard, the stock price will drop significantly. Theres just to many competitors offering slightly reduced rates or fees to have the stock maintain this price per share.

We are the market now, I wish many retards will win in 2021
I nominate myself for ROTY retard. Stumbled upon this site in December from r/conspiracy as The Big Short was one of my favorite movies and over there we knew how fucked rona was gonna be before mainstream got a hold of it. 

Started with a total of 2k. Proceeded to make a little easy money not knowing wtf I was doing in March. Quickly took out a loan against my CC for 5k so starting capital was about 7.5k. I bought SPY puts. First time in my life seeing thousands vaporize overnight following Seperation Retardation. Then jumped into tanker gang. Then dumped the rest of my savings at the time into PCG. Thousands lost again. I bought TSLA calls at the what was then ATH then it dropped a cool $200. Portfolio looked like a small ramp of gains into the Marianas Trench of losses. Pissed away about 13k. Got so bad I said fuck all this and deleted my Robinhood app. 

Read a fuck ton of books to try and learn wtf I was doing. Watched a bunch, paper traded some. Opened a TDA and put in a measly 1k. I was fighting for my life with a pixel of health like a classic Justin Wong fight. I put whatever I had leftover from unemployment insurance each week. I made a killing off VTIQ and then put profits into SHLL. Held for a little too long and ended up getting crushed during the S P AC massacre erasing damn near all gains in my TDA. Saving grace of the fall season was PLTR, NIO, and GME. Sitting at roughly 5k. 

TL;DR - made ALL rookie mistakes in one year - lost 13k. Started a TDA with 1k, still fucked up, but did better, at 5k and with a solid understanding that I’m still a retard. 

So, how long before I’m profitable? Who knows. Can’t do math. Down 13k (95%) on old account up 2k on new account. Won’t take long considering new account I’m heavy in the four horsemen, TSLA, NIO, PLTR, GME. Shares and leaps. Cheers you guys. Happy Holidays and thanks for the 13k, and counting, tuition fee.

They announced 1,000 more store closures by April. The stock will drop fast after that.
Red Bull is poison man. You could make an effort to put only healthy foods in your body and you’d be much less stressed about health issues. You’re worried about them for a reason. Wake up, change your life.
Third strain of the virus now
They have been trying to make a sars vaccine for a while and every time they animal test it the animals get antibodies but when they encounter the cold again they get it worse than ever and it kills them. Its called like a a pathogen pathway or memory or some shit I can't remember. They used ferrets before then they did it once with humans and it killed a few of them when encountering the virus. 

This time they skipped animal testing and also peculiarly culled all the minks at the same time, minks are close to ferrits so it seems very odd. Anyways time will tell if people that have antibodies from the vax will get harder when reexposed. You can google ferret tests all day what I said is true

Suppose you're ITM or OTM and you expect some after hours action on expiry,  in your favor.  You have 90 minutes after market close to exercise your options.  

To avoid weekend risk,  you need cash to take the other side after-hours (short if you have calls,  go long if you have puts).

Short of that,  if you're playing hot potato with 0dtes until market close and you're ITM you may as well exercise.

Lost $20000 more to a property salesman scam. Lost $2000 to another market company and the latest is $350 in markets CG . Never use any of these companies mentioned
I thought they remove it if you got a new flair?

Wasted the best investing years of my life.  It’s not that I didn’t try, it’s just that I used to be a retard.  I still am a retard, but I also used to be.

I had no money in 2008, so I missed that dip.  Then I lost money in REITs, Chipotle stock, and Frontier (the cable company that went to zero).  Also sat around and cash ganged during the last 10 years of bull market.

I’m 31 and the only money I’ve made has been the past 3 months.  I started hanging out in this degen circus of a sub and actually started making decent profits.
Fredo, don't ever take sides with anyone against the family again. Ever.

lol in plenty of places you’re lucky if they even take 10% down. Shit tons of properties are getting full cash offers. It’s ridiculous
Found this sub 4 years ago and started dabbling in stocks on Robinhood. I put about 2000 in my account and was making some decent gains until everyone on here was talking about how RAD was about to enter a merger and it was gonna moon. I remember I had missed out on a lot of big plays this sub was making back then and I pretty much went all in on this one. Rad then dropped from $8 to $4 and $4 to $2 while I kept averaging down. Eventually got out and quit for quiet a while. 

But, anyone who has quit before knows you always come back. When I did come back maybe a year later, Robinhood offered options now. So I proceeded to dabble with that even though I had no idea what a call or put was and had no business trading options. Ended up losing another couple hundred and quit for another year and now I’m back again, but this time I’m taking a much safer approach by investing heavily into good stocks like GME. 

All together I have “quit” 2 times and lost almost 3k..
Please explain the squeeze to me retard. Please explain the technical and financial aspects of this historic short squeeze that once happened with another company that may have a chance to happen with a shit stock like GME. Go I'll wait for you to find the DD and copy paste it. Yall so confident about shit you know nothing about 😂

Right? I wonder if the other end of this trade can write this off on taxes as a charitable contribution.
Reason im here saying this is people are seeing dip opportunity in baba. Play on chinese stocks are well timed put buys or otm credit spreads.

Theta gang is great but not on low IV garbage. sELl pUtS oN stOCkS yOu'D LiKe t0 0WN" no.. more like sell puts on shit that yoyo's like crazy because if you **do** get assigned you'll be able to flip it on the oscillations. The problem with those low IV stocks is that the risk reward is so fucking bad, yet when the black swan/outlier events happens and you get shares put to you, it's usually a major fucking blowout of IV, and you get fucked in the ass.. you would have been better off selling high IV in the first place because at least you get properly compensated for taking risk. I guess it's hard for me to convey that risk because i'm not good with math.. but it's something about volatility acceleration and tail risk.
TL;DR: GME to triple digits 🚀 🚀 🚀

Theta gang here. 

Started after the carona crash. Up almost 40% on the year. Learned fast to always stay in the market. I missed a huge green day once by trying to predict a red day (went cash gang) and it felt terrible. Biggest regret is selling 10 shares of tsla pre split around $1600. 

Selling covered calls is a tool that can be free bonus money if used properly without limiting    tour upside. It can also help you brace for impact. If I’m feeling bearish I’ll sell a call to hedge but I’ll never go cash gang again. 

Modest steady gains. I buy calls every now and then but I have to really feel it in my plums.

I think a great direction for GameStop to go would be like a micro center. Computer hardware sales / Newegg. I think maintaining a smaller store footprint would be good for this and they could have their speciality product be used physical games since it’s getting harder and harder to find those as time goes on it will be like a time capsule alongside their primary revenue generator. They could also offer discounts on computer hardware or consoles online for trading in games.

Nah, relax. We're stuck in this $20-$22 range. Bears are gonna talk crap about it because it's in their interest it drops down as much as possible.

Unless you really need that money right now, I would not sell those 500 shares, especially not at a loss. This is almost guaranteed to hit $30 next year, so any short-term unrealized losses will pale in comparison to what you will have in just a few months.

I watched the price action closely this week.

$22 is HUGE resistance, we had no chance to go 1 cent above it this week.

$20 is also a very solid support. Once we touched it, a crapton of buys pushed it back up to $20.1. When that happens, you know that $20 is not gonna be easy to break.

Nothing's truly guaranteed, but if you're gonna let your your emotions control your paperhands, you are never gonna make big gains, ever.

I started as a 14 year old by buying one call for less than $100 on Apple before the iPhone 6 launch and made a few hundred dollars. Mostly stocks and boring stuff afterwards. Traded 3x long VIX in 2018, made a few thousand going all in a few times and quickly lost everything in one trade (Actually went negative). 

Six years later and it was the cheapest education ever. Only ever lost $120 and now I've realized enough to pay my tuition and still have 20k of house money to play around with.
Same. Bought that famous Monday when it ran hard at $18.50. Like many others I truly believed it is undervalued (even without Cohen) and decided to average down throughout the next couple weeks. Will continue to hold pending q4 results and/or any substantial news. One to look out for is a sales update sometime mid-Jan from boomer Sherman.
I appreciate the support. Merry Chrimuh

So i started late 2019. I didn’t know anything and didn’t know if I was trading or investing. My dad told me a list of stocks but mainly played inovio. So back in march I was playing the swings on inovio. I was a stupid trader and would go all in for 2k and buy shares. I was making around $300 dollars a week with 0 risk management and had no idea how dangerously I was actually playing. When inovio ran to $30 I had 1k in shares and two separate short term calls. I was up 8k and ultimately sold for a profit of 6.3k. I then pulled out 2k to put in savings and it went downhill from there. I started taking bigger trades and messing with options. I took a 2.6k loss on inovio and lost another 2k overtime with random stupid trades. I was down to my last 1k and took a break for a long time. I started reading stock books, taking some classes, learning technical analysis and risk management strategies. I currently have 2k I’m playing with and want to daytrade options until I have 10k when I will invest 50% index funds and 50% blue chip stocks. I’m happy where I’m at :)

Of course, what if AAPL does master cars and start taking over that market too within the next decade? Some stuff is hard to foresee

here's what i've gathered so far:

\- the fed raising rates

\- investors dumping equities for cash

\- weakness of other currencies as a safe haven relative to the dollar

I saw what happpened in 2008 and when obama left office we had a chad dollar

i think the same thing will happen again but no one wants to admit that the fed has to raise rates eventually -- they will, my calls are for 2023

Turn on Patterns as well. I also create my own trend lines from the past low candles to the low of current candles and vice versa from the top of the highs. I do this from several time periods. The farther out and more candles the line touches the  more confirmation of the trend line and where the stock will move within the future. By using the macd + volume + ttc squeeze I can gauge where the stock will likely move for shorter term trend lines. A good indicator of change is using a triangle where both high and low lines meet within a channel. This is usually at a point of a reversal or stabilizing event.  

i have found the market is aware of these points and usually you get a lot of activity if you are looking at the active trader window. Thats where RSI and MACD are important to see if the price has momentum to break up into a higher channel or drop below. Don't be afraid to keep making lines and extending them to patterns that you see. More points confirmed + Time = the more likely the stock will move in that direction. 

Granted this does not take in account random events and news breaks that alter the momentum and volume. Even then I have typically seen that price movement will stay within the broader channels. If it breaks the channel I typically account for a correction. 

Im new to this as well and have been studying as much as possible. The results have been positive. I was able to gauge aapl and gme movement within +-5 cents for 24hrs allowing for quick trades. Again volatility, news, as well as future time trends in a stock create more unknowns. Once you find the pivots gauge the downside and upside and have a entry exit plan for which way the stock chooses to go. (Options also will need to factor in theta decay) IE the stock hits a channel but the movement is to slow to be profitable.

**Movements tend to bounce inside the channels that are confirmed. Ie if it bounces off the top or bottom of the channel then it will usually be seen moving to the opposite channel line.

Read what? That people below the age of 70 have a 99% survival rate and that people over it have a 96% rate? That most deaths have 2-4 co morbitities meaning a common cold could kill them? We went from storming Normandy to cowering in fear over a mild cold. Absolute pussy boomers and all the millennial and gen z that go along with them.
Last Year a lady hit the back of my car and totalled my car. The check that I received from her insurance company I decided to finally invest. A friend told me about Robinhood so I went and bought a google share and other vanguard for dividends. 1-2 months later, I installed reddit and joined r/stocks and investings and found out about r/wallstreetbets. This is where it became interesting. I would see peoples post of 700% gains, 2,000% gains. And I got so excited! So Without knowing anything about options, I bought my first Spy Call expiring in a week. That was when Covid happened and stock crashed. After I bought spy puts, it went back up and I started being happy. Bought RCL puts. Was happy my money was recovering. And that was when the 10 day stock market recovery happened and I have 4 Spy puts contract expiring in a week. Money went down to $0. Decided to put another $200 to try to recover it. And lost it all recently buying PLTR Calls and it crashed. Anyways. Thats my story. Just had to vent and get it off my chest, its been bothering me for a really long time for being this autistic. Love you guys! Let me know if you have any question.

I had completely decided to invest only in index funds, the day I invested all of my HSA was the night before the crash started in March. Found WSB shortly after, fuck index funds. Was a 🌈🐻 and didn't believe in a v (or now fucking ✔️) recovery so I got LEAPs shorting IWM that I'm down 90% 9k on. 

Luckily I'm also deep in Canoo warrants in my retirement accounts, and the gains there more than make up for my losses. Terrible year. Excited for 2021.
Been in GME since November 17, buying, selling, holding and tracking everything that's going on around this stock.  


I don't think we go below $19 on Monday. But I'm a retarded amateur, so there's that...
Sir, that's called cryptocurrencies.

I have officially gone from $3k —> $700 —> $3.4k —> $115 —> 3.8k this is the way
I'm muslim and never cared about merry Christmas.  But the peeps that are anti happy holidays, I always wish them happy holidays.
That a weird way of u asking for a juicy vascular cock
You must’ve been naughty this year

Got that china risk factor, well it always did which is why i will never invest in Chinese stocks, but now more ppl are seeing that no Chinese stock is safe. Take that with what you will.

I’m realizing that spy puts suck ass for the premium and it’s much easier to manage a long UVXY position...but god dammit I want my spy puts to print some day at least

What are you going to do about this oppression??
✋Bought shares at 19 and held through the earnings drop and added more. Ain't no room for paper hands on the way to the moon 🚀
No one tell him
There are very few shares left available to short at this point, hence the ridiculous 160%+ short/float radio. We've seen a massive increase in ours for Jan and June of 2021, so thats the next move they have to run down the price.
Are you trying to be worth as much as my dying grandma? Or you tryna figure out the color of your next lamo and hooker? All in again pussy

Started in 2017 with 5000 in a Roth IRA. 3 shares of AMZN, 10 MSFT, 10 BRK.B. Added to those 3 each year in ‘18 and ‘19 and ‘20. Decided I was going to actively manage in Sept of 2019. In February of 2020 decided the 30% gain I had made in 3 years was too good to be true and went all cash, yes I said February. When markets started to go south I thought holy fuck I am literally the smartest person alive and I can buy this massive 10% dip! Panic sold after next 5%. Holy fuck another 10% dip to buy! Panic sold the next 5% Market bottoms and at that point I am so shit scared to lose everything I wait to get in until April. Long story short I went cash at the absolute perfect top, made every mistake in the book on the way down and have managed to make a 50% gain this year.
Hahahaha u fucker I’m in !!!
I need something but I don’t know what
That's not even how mcap works for a merger , it's not 677M , he's a fking retard like every person that is buying spac right now. After the merger UWM will have like 1.7B worth of shares outstanding.
Weird flex but okay.
Hoiiiiinyeeeeaaah

Citron was also very vocal about being long on Luckin Coffee before it dropped like a rock.  
Also, it did pump quite a bit on the tweet, moved it from 25 to 34 that day, 86% up in a day isn't very reasonable, I'm just gonna wait and see if it drops more.

Hmm does that buy in price influence the bottom?
I actually feel poorer getting it. Like they are actively devaluing currency. It feels like a permanent pay cut instead of free money.
How about you go read up on covid.

I just checked the last 2 years of quarterly reports and they’ve lost money every single time
Wish me luck boys and gals, I have 27 calls on NIO and 600 shares. YOLO in one stock. Give me some luck 2021!
Merry Christmas to y’all!
Merry Christmas WSB - thanks for a great year. Made some money, lost some money, but had many many laughs along the way. 

Enjoy the day with your loved ones instead of sitting around loathing in your self hatred you filthy degenerates.

It was all in good fun haha
No..
They were .01 per share, or $1 per contract when I bought them

I set a limit sell order as .40 per share or $40 per contract

I made 4k total. I saw it at .62 at one point. Or 62 per contract


I threw that 4k into GME so that's nice but that other 2.4k

Should have never looked

I love the complete void of compassion and empathy WSB brings me.  Its so comforting.
Retard is playing spacs but don't know how marketcap transition works for a spac , UWM isn't going to have 677Mcap
That titty would slip farther than my all time chart
Shorting GME is such a suboptimal play in this bull market wtf are they thinking still in it
Started working for a brokerage firm in 2016 with no knowledge of how anything works or what I was doing but figured I needed to have some skin in the game to talk about it appropriately. Bought a some boomer stocks that didn’t really do shit over a time. Sold that and bought Tesla @ 185 pre split and sold like paper hand bitch at 260 5 months later. Fast forward to this year and I started trading options in February, beginning with SPCE and was basically day trading. Lost the majority of my account in April by being a 🌈🐻 and it’s
Been a slow bleed out ever since.
Retirement accounts have had a few great plays such as PLTR, NIO , DAL. Down to my final $300 in my original account, praying VALE to the moon🚀🚀
He’s an idiot I’m up 100% on DAL shares this year lol
Bunch of fuckin twitch moderators
Not afraid of a pull back. Looking at the closest comparison which is Alteryx in 26 years their valuation is now $128 a share different size market caps, but comparable. Also the CEO is incredibly intelligent and is the heartbeat of the company to me that’s invaluable.
only need like 200k. 100k for downpayment for a 700-800k house, 50k left over for stonks and rest for an expensive gift formyself

we  getting there boys
**SIR THIS IS A WENDY’S**
Great now they can try to begin to compete with the other giants who have more customers and make more money
PLTR obviously
Started a trading a four years ago, actually trading/investing is what got me into what my career is now which is being a fully series licensed financial advisor. Started trading options with 1k turned it into 3k, then blew that up. Then blew up another 1k account before actually studying theta gang strategies and mostly use far OTM credit spreads and sell calls/puts on my holdings to have another source of income, up 218% YTD.
Tsla is worth a lot of billions too
But not today. Tomorrow.
Still a decent play. Good job.
\*Neutral
My theta gang friend is selling puts on UAL so he can make 9% annual returns. I can't even
Not me.  Every year, as soon as I said, "huh.. I guess this shit really does just keep going up", and buy in... The Event would happen.
Merry Christmas retards. Told my dad imma retire in 5 years (27yo) and that I know more about money and investing than he does (63yo about to retire).

You can use options as a way to pre-buy stock. So, if you think that a stock is going to go up a lot in the next 3 years but you can't afford as much as you want right now - you could buy options with a far out expiration.

Then, you could save $$ until the expiration so that you have enough to exercise the options.

Assuming stonks go up, your average price per share will be higher than what you would have paid had you bought shares initially, but lower than what you would pay if you had waited.
Buying AAPL since I turned 20 and found out what a stock was.

My 20s and early 30s were spent on some Motley Fool subscriptions which actually have reasonable DD and were responsible for some serious gains over the years.

Then I got Robinhood in mid 2018 and the ducking wheels came off the car once I got deep into options. 2018-2019 was a gold rush, man. Flipping calls for 100% overnight (had I held any of those leaps I would have been looking at 2000+% now... live and learn!) and trading in the AM while the dog shits on neighbour’s lawns.

2020 was the year of theta plays for me, and it’s been pretty good so far. About $100k gain (50% return on cash) and potentially another $50k next week if $ABNB can get its pump on back to $165 for me.

Maybe once the world is sane again I’ll start spending and enjoying this money, but until then keep stacking it up.

ALWAYS TAKE PROFITS!

Rake 10-20% of any gains into an account you don’t trade with, so you’ll have some nice pocket money when you want a new iPhone or whatever.
Yea . Even did the math in my calculator app way wrong to get $4k. 

I’m a trader.
Smoking weed will make you a better parent tbh.
Lol this guy.
I guess the risk is if 12/31 comes out and more big names are showing short GME.  Would it cause GME to tank?
Hahahaa leave those stupid fucks to invest in GYNA shit

That’s a lesson I see all moon investors learn eventually

Thanks!

Honestly, I am pretty new to the stock market in terms of having a reasonable stack to trade on there. I was a bitc01n maximalist for much of the last 8 years, though I did get lucky with AMD because I thought crypt0 had an outstretched effect on the market (Sell the shovels, and all that), I still just bought larger tech stocks (with a few exceptions) that I thought were "safe" since my less safe money was already in a crazy vehicle, I didn't want to be 100% YOLO. 

I don't know if I'll find my next bitc01n/AMD/Chipotle, but when I sold TSLA I thought "wait, large cap stocks aren't supposed to go parabolic this much this fast, right?", and I've been used to TSLA correcting heavily for much of the last 7 years and the naysayers being slow to catch on (Hopefully it still does because I'm a long term believer and want back in haha). 

Elon still made me some good cash, but I settled on Model S money, when I could have had new house money. Oh well. My appetite for losing hundreds of thousands of dollars went out the window in 2017. I don't want to experience that again, and so I guess I'm OK with being called a boomer now, lol.
I mean it wouldn’t be that bad if it wasn’t for #QueenPiker and #Yolo
Imagine if Pelosi had a nip slip? my nuts would burst apart.
Good points. I just want to drive home that Bezos isn’t strapped for cash by any stretch of the imagination lol. You’re right though so I agree. 

Happy holidays!
“Us” = the fuck? 

I was picturing some sort of Christmas Eve slip up by a Twilio exec but you’re really on WSB dropping insider info?
Merry Christmas ❄❄❄
What am I gonna get?
First thing I noticed.
Wow good call, hopefully it’s not before Monday open. Those 210c look good
So you volunteered to be laid off, you own multiple properties, and you're upset that you have to dig into your retirement fund... wake the fuck up. Most people dont even have a retirement fund, let alone a job that pays a living wage. You come across as one of the most entitled people I have ever seen on here. Waaaaaah my Airbnb is not paying my bills... get the fuck over it.
How about with your dick out? Ffs
What u mean dude ?

Did u read the fucken update ?

A guy at target told me about this on my 15 and I thought he was actually retarded. Now it’s DD on here and I still think it’s retarded. With that being said I’ll be buying Monday at open
Yeeeyy wiiiii it only goes down!
Yeah everything is up so much now it’s hard to make a move
I wish I had a lemonade from the fair.  Oh wait, there was no fair. Fuk you bat flu!
Just gotta say I appreciate your consistent hate on a college degree
Fwiw, I think we pull back to around 26.30 plus or minus 15 cents within the next 4 to 8 trading days before we pump hard to 36.50 levels (plus or minus or a dollar). So I’m waiting a little longer to move in on calls to get in at the bottom. Holding shares tho. PLTR FTW
im confused...9988 is baba?
You guys heard the man. Calls.
I cringe when people use the word "libtards" for real. You are a meme.
b/c they actually have clients who purchases their goods/services for money.

most of these companies havent sold a damn thing. they are priced on pure hopium. Like NKLA with their rolling  a truck down a hill. 

Unfortunately its a low bar for EV stocks. TSLA, the leader makes more money from stock offerings than selling cars for example.

Does anyone else have GameStop $21calls exp 12/31? How fucked am I
It's actually a huge deal.. people would be surprised how little they actually would do if they weren't motivated to work for money.. some people.
I'll let you know bc those with GME bags won't tell you(confirmation bias and cognitive dissonance) does GME have a future? No. Will the squeeze happen? Probably already did. Should you get out before you lose more money? Thats up to you.
That's only $1000 with some change. You broke bum. Try next time with your Wendy's savings
Less deals and coupons than uber. Higher service fee. I think shittron is right this time
Not really lol
Ryan cohen bought in at 16.05, i guess the most you can lose is $2450

Also, if you use tax software like TurboTax, you can link your robinhood account and it'll import your 1099. Good idea to double check it before filing, though. Wouldn't surprise me if RH 1099d me someone else's shit.
I feel like 2021 will be boring compared to this year. It wasn't just Tesla this year. ROKU, SE, ZM, PTON, FSLY, NET, TWLO, SHOP, NIO, etc. some crazy moves across the board.

Maybe it's only because it's wsb, but I actually wanna say GME might have a shot. The market cap is still so low on it and there's still a ton of potential buyers from shorts wanting out.
Also, Contagion is a way worse scenario than what happened in the real world.
Then add rocket emojis

Snowing for me in pacific time

Update?
Well because amazon is a massive online retailer that has done a ton of hard work to minimize shipping costs, maximize inventory, and maximize speed of delivery. GameStop will never be able to catch up to that
I almost went back and edited my comment saying that is a conservative estimate.
M G I is in a dip right now: you can think about it 🤔

The fact is about 74% of this sub wishes a covid like event would hit again in the new year.
in what situation would it be more profitable to exercise the call option as opposed to selling it?
Thanks, I’m gonna weight my options. I did make $1200 day trading a few days last weej and I guess we have (2?) stim packages coming. I’m married so that’s $1200 each so maybe it’s not so bad even if it halves in value.
It’ll bounce back and forth like this for the next few weeks. Sell covered calls on it and make premium until it’s called away. Thetagang style.

Covid is way oversold. Definitely a reversal soon.

Sure they have a ton of locations but those are a noose around their necks if they are getting squeezed by other retailers. They have to staff and pay property fees that cut into their margins while 100% online retailers don’t have to worry about those costs. Unless those assets are being sold off for that stated value, then the valuation doesn’t speak to GameStop’s ability to monetize it, which they’ve already been failing to do.

I think knowledge is power when it comes to trading.  The better picture you have of a company, the more accurate your investment thesis will be.  


I just don’t see history as a great predictor of future movement in a price.

Literally the only reason I like posting here, other subs just don’t get it
I was saying the banks should lend to retards again so we have another housing crash. I didn’t have enough cash last time
With the stimulus sure to pass eventually and the billions being printed each money next year, I don't really see the dollar going up any significant amount. I also don't have a good grasp on what makes the dollar move either so I'm just guessing.

I just saw that.  Legit embarrassing but funny.
Started so that I could get my own studio in Manhattan but my trades have managed me to keep me in Jersey city and stay consistently poor.
Good to know so I can have an exit if I need. I guess 10k is the most I can lose which isn’t the end of the world and gonna get checks from government for married couples so $1200 I guess. And I guess there’s another $1200 held up in Congress?
Who is driving the short interests if most of us here are gme bulls? Any idea?

Same same. But different. 70/30 GME/PLTR

Plan to transition bulk of GME to PLTR on exit for long hold.
That's ok. If it goes up Monday pre market you'll be good. Accidents can be good. I'm sure one of those billionaires was an accident.

But in all seriousness, if you don't have like the size to take on 100 shares, you can just sell pre market Monday. I doubt the price will be that far off from end of day today so it's just random variance if you are up or not.
Keep us updated on the consistency of your shit
How the fu*k can you lose money in the biggest pumped bull market in history?
I've lurked for 5 months. First time I had a useful observation to contribute. If you think they are gonna be resuscitated that's great. Just sharing what I saw today. And my personal guess. I've made some stupid bets before, but I wouldn't risk it in gme.

I don't see snow on RH, maybe just for some time zones? West coast btw.
I am with you. I had $8k worth at $280 something then bought more today so my average is now 43 shares at $258. So sad
Okay thanks fam

I’m too old for this joke.
Thanks for taking the time to reply and good luck friend.
I learned to read so so I could read this post and boy am I glad I did. I just came twice. GME is my new fetish
Is it worth blocking some folks on this sub or no? Too many folks to block?
They are two completely different plays. 

PLTR is like investing in Netflix when Blockbuster still existed. So PLTR plays are about loading up on as much as possible, using calls to use those gains to buy more shares. But ultimately just grabbing as much as possible while its significance is still pretty much unknown to the masses.

GME is a typical short term meme play. But there is some self proclaimed "professional" pump n dump collaboration of memesters and social influencers that are working hard to keep up the hype to create this mythical Short Squeeze. But because of that inertia, there have been great tendies for anyone that jumped in every time GME hit the floor. When GME crashes again, I will probably buy some calls because it's smart to bet on stupid, and I'm sure they will pump it easily again.
Congrats. Now Fuck You

Godspeed brother. I’ve been on em for a couple months now, I think they’re going to $100 by end of 2021, maybe average out with some May $35c?
I'm not an american but lives in the states. Started trading April 2019 (19 at the time) after I got my SSN with $50 my first deposit, on robinhood of course. haven't discovered wsb back then, I kept depositing and buying stuff and panic selling stuff lol. Sold amd at $28 from $32 cuz the trade war 2019 summer stuff, sold qualcomm at $68 after earnings tanked. I had no idea what I was doing back then lol. kept depositing and made to 10k account by this march, been down from $100-1k the whole that year never went green lol. Then tesla came along, went green 20%, but then march came, deposited more, by June I had 50k still barely breaking even lol. 1 day in green over all the next day in red again. Until nio took me from $5 to now. Been thinking about buying a tesla, but Im too greedy to pull out lol.
What are your ARKG positions?
I have a reoccurring dream that I fuck a Latina milf who is my maid 

Psychics of wsb what does this mean?

Lol yea I’m about the same
christmas is one a year my friend
I just had a friend tell me his order was confirmed today, so there's that. 

For one they have brand recognition, which will take time for others to develop. Secondly, when you talk to the employees it feels more like talking to an apple employee who gives a shit and can help you than it does a Walmart employee who doesn't care. You get the feeling that you're talking with an aficionado, or a sommelier when picking out wines. And then there's the fact that they are shifting to more of an online focus. 

But really what does it for me is that they currently have assets on hand valued at over $2.8B when the current market cap is $1.4B. 

Once they finish getting whipped into shape, the increased revenues and then profits will show that a higher market cap is warranted.
Yeah but the timeline. “Could be tomorrow, could be in 5,8,10 years”. Risk v reward, opportunity cost.. hard to pull triggers all things considered. Thanks for sharing your thoughts though. (And I don’t disagree with you that these areas are the future).

Yah iuno. I hope you don’t have so many shares because Jack Ma literally fked China up. People in NA don’t even know how bad it was and how he nearly toppled the entire Chinese economy and then he had the balls to call the Chinese government out for stopping him.

If you don’t know what I’m talking about then you shouldn’t have 50k in shares.
Went from 18K to 120K this year thanks to TSLA.

Next year i’m hoping to hit $200K atleast with TSLA and ARKG 🚀

Go read all the DD from u/UberKikz. Hes the go to guru for this. Secondarily. Its not overvalued an over value stock. People don't fucking understand market cap. They see $20 and freak out "aaaa this is gonna crash." There was a fucking article about $QS "being the second most expensive auto maker in the industry." But the fucking market cap is a low 3.3b but the sp is ~$110. Buy the stock, hold it, ride the wave. Make 100% in the next few months and call it a good run.

GME will be out of business in a few years.

Water MEH LONE
Hopefully they’re a few months out, it’s due to come down for a couple weeks before 🚀
Gotta go to the daily thread with baby gains.
i am confident it’ll definitely reach 20.95 again, and much higher. however u should know that GME is not for paper handed, it drops 20% and rises 20% within the same month. if it retraces back down i wouldn’t be surprised, but im sure itll bounce back.

my experience was buying at the top at 15.15, watching it drop to 10+, but holding through and here we are at 20. the same thing happened to a few others during the 18+ run up before the drop to 13 post earnings. 

if i were you i’d hold thru, but you should decide for yourself based on your risk tolerance. cheers and merry christmas

They're all gonna be Spencers or Orange Julius by Valentine's day.
I started trading when I was in 10th grade with $500 and my dad matched me $500 and set up a custodial account for me on E*TRADE.... 10 years later you could just say that I don’t have to worry about money anymore.
Thanks for the snow RH... lost so much today and that’s all you can give me? Maybe next -10% day I’ll get a crew neck sweatshirt to get the co-Eds.

Tesla is a 600 bil market cap .  Gaining 30 bil is a hell of a lot easier when you’re that large
The lack of knowledge here is concerning Lol. What are you guys doing trading options if you don’t know how dividends work?

By paying out a dividend, the stock price drops. You will likely break even when selling.

If it were as easy as moving funds around, everyone would be rich off that
Because your fellow man is gay and retarded.
Just sell as much as you need to until you meet your risk tolerance. No point stressing over stocks.

Maybe look into selling a cover called if you plan to keep more than 100.

Bought my first stock (HAS) on August 14 2020. Not active on WSB, but heard about it.

Tried boomervesting, owning 69.4209001 diversified ass shares. After 1.5 months, made $5 profit on a $1000 investment. Fuck that shit. Sold everything off.

Knew about GME stock at that time, cuz I saw Michael Bury owning bigly shares. Become obsessed.

***Why does Big Short guy own this dying company?***

Did a detailed DD on my own, back in September, before I even knew this sub was slowly getting obsessed with the same stock I was getting obsessed with.

Became a GME believer right then and there, months before joining WSB. Didn't have the balls to go all in. Fucking idiot. Fucking moron.

Tried the REGN Trump pump. Lost money.

Fuck it - started paperhanding GME on November 17.

Became active in WSB late November/early December. I feel like a retard at home here.

Received hate on WSB for paperhanding GME. Finally making money though. $640 swing trading/day-trading profit with a $3000 cash position in like 2 3 weeks time. Not bad for tapping buttons on my smartphone few times a day.

Tried MRNA vaccine pump. Lost money.

Own 246 GME shares at $13.3 after the ***OMNICHANNEL*** Q3 earnings report stock price dip. Paperhand that shit at $13.85 for a microdick profit.

Price go up to $14.85. I wait for dip.

Price go up to $15.85. ***I wait for dip***.

Dip to $15.4. ***I FOMO hard YOLO in all my spare cash.***

Own 231 GME shares. Angry at myself because now I own 15 less shares for more money invested.

Monday. GME sleep. 💤

Tuesday. GME moon 25% 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Wednesday. GME minimoon 5% 🚀

Thursday. GME bleed. 🩸

&#x200B;

**Fuck it.** 💎👐 GME 🚀🚀🚀🌙

* Mid-2000s, immediately when I got my first post-college and post-law school job
* A couple thousand, steadily added with each paycheck after that.
* Immediately profitable. But I took a huge $150,000 hit during the Great Recession, took a $1,000,000 hit this March. Recovered from both pretty quickly (within a year) by not selling and adding new cash after bottoming..

It’s because everyone is a muted and censored retarded pussy nowadays. I even got banned for 3 days from here for just calling the market F & G.

Remember when GILD was a thing here (you had to be around earlier this year)? Yea it's now at it's yearly lows...ran a script to see which S&P 500 stocks were still lower than March.

GILD, WBA, BIIB, and FE. 

INTC is the only (not bio) tech stock that's anywhere close to its March lows, which is quite pathetic.

Out of those, none are interesting except maybe WBA if they can somehow get involved in this vaccine disridbution in 2021.

Camping out in the bathroom at the family xmas party, so I figured what the hell.

My grandparents first opened a Edward Jones account for me at the age of 13 and bought me 10 shares of boomer $T. It wasn’t until 16 or 17 that I actually cared enough to do anything with stocks. Somewhere there in high school I realized that real money could be made in the stock market. I had them put an additional 500$ of my money in and sold some $T to buy $GOOG. At this time goog was 750ish a share. I spent the next 4-5 years of my life buying boomer stocks and watching everything go up in the bull market. 

I got introduced to Reddit in late 2018. Somewhere in 2019 I decided I wanted to get more active with my portfolio management and switch to a non-boomer platform, hence the creation of my robinhood account. I bought some more boomer stocks and I few other I did research on. In late 2019 I started discovering the financial side of Reddit. That is about the time I found this place that I now call home. I started using option about then, I had lost a good chunk on money(still a college student so like only a couple Gs) then March 2020 hit. Spy Puts were the best thing since sliced bread. Literally couldn’t go tits up. Made some pretty good money, decided this option thing was really easy. I proceeded to lose most of that money in pump and dump stocks until about October. In October I called it quits. I decided I should probably learn my stuff. Since October I have had steady gains and now sit at +20% on the year after being down 75 at its worst. 

It’s been a wild ride. I graduate college in April with an 85k job lined up. I can’t wait to get my big boy pants on an add another 0 or two to my account balance.

Peace out ‘tards

Very valid points my man. I don’t agree with thinking of their wealth as just shares of their own company but I get what you’re saying. It’s just sickening in all honesty.. I’ve seen visualizations of Bezos wealth and it’s just...gross. Its just hard to think they sit on mountains of wealth while others struggle while literally working just as hard as they had to. Of course not everyone, but just because you don’t bust your ass working a 9-5 or more doesn’t mean you don’t deserve a good life -which is largely dictated by currency holding imaginary value lol

Exactly. Just saw an article that total billionaire wealth this year *soared* a trillion dollars to a total of $4 trillion.

Unfortunately, 80% of my positions are boring index funds & wsb has found me the ARK funds in May, LVGO in March, DKNG IPO, airlines & cruises at their March lows, TAN, ICLN, NIO @ $7, MGNI, TSM, AMD, NVDA, NET & others. 

WSB gave me the courage to dive in and say fuck it, I was a lurker on r/financialindependence until mid-2019, wsb got me to throw $2k on TSLA in my Roth IRA when it was around $70. I’m stuck now, I never take more than $3k position on any individual company, but I’m stuck here. I’ve always known how to read financials, wsb gives me some tickers to dive into and make an ‘educated’ guess. The only options I have are LEAPs in the Roth on solid companies.🍻
Let me downvote this real quick.

Life isn’t a game of karma though. I’m not sure anyone deserves anything that happens to them in life, but the guys you’re talking about weren’t just given that money in cash or anything. They created a company, grew it to the point that they were able to bring it to the public markets and the general public decided their company was worth X. While this is happening, Bezos or Elon held onto as many shares of the company as they could. Just because they didn’t sell out before the massive growth, because they believed in what they built, they don’t deserve their shares of their company? What global need did those other 99.9999999% of people satisfy with their creations?
If someone did, they wouldn't be on here. Especially now.
What about India and South America?
Just buying more and refusing to sell them is an absolutely fine play. 

I'm just thinking about a possible opportunity to turn my 500 shares into 550 without depositing more money into a broker or averaging up much more.

Agree and would add that with earnings only a month after lockup ends we have to check insider selling in February. If they know March earnings are great the smart ones will perhaps limit selling, knowing greater pump is coming. Definitely have to watch this.

I don’t mean the “hey. I work at a bank. I’m a finance guy.” Talking more the PE, hedge fund, guys who run their own books and market makers. The amount of information they have and the speed they get it is exponentially greater than the average investor. And for someone like me that has a day job and can’t be tuned into what’s going on in the general world of finance other than the occasional articles I read while brushing my teeth in the AM, it’s like bringing a knife to a gun fight.

O multiple. Damn
What's everybody smoking, drinking, and stuff tonight?
Good treats for a chinchilla?
Saved up (not sure how much) and poured it into a robo account. Pulled it out in Feb. It was around $350k at that time. Like a true tard sat on the portfolio. Had a -$50k wake up call in March hello!!! 

Reconfigured the portfolio. Had about $300k to start w turned it into $700k March to December. All short term holds (like a few months) or long term (still own them). No options. I have $850k total to invest now. Mostly big cap tech. Some small cap late in the year. And YES ETFs they counterbalance the stock swings. Always have kept cash around to buy opportunities.

Want to try trading a <10% on big bet option trades in the new year.
Forget all this shit about “wash trade” you will be filing a 1099b meaning you only have to worry about your P/L.
Even more retarded then
Wtf is that shit

There will be another opportunity to buy the dip
You've definitely got it backwards. To day trade you have to actually be smart and know your charts and shit. Just buy leaps on a green energy or tech company and do nothing while your money doubles.
Dunno which is the bigger snowflake. The ones on the screen or the one bitching about the snowflakes.
seems like an autistic idea... i’m interested
Merry Christmas brothers - but the Fubo dip
jesus what a retard. What does he think GameStop will offer that Amazon doesn't already have in spades?
Bro I legit just turned 10 years old.
Damn I refresh and I see u/AtWarWithAll is drunk.
Thanks for your advise
Nothing matters except for how autistic you are. Do you hate people? If so you will be able to make money. If you aren’t autistic then just stop here.
Did he post a pic of the 6k --> 100k trade?

snow falling on robinhood precursor to stocks falling monday ?
I just lost my last $1k during christmas eve yesterday. Options expired worthless PLTR/BB. 

In the last 6 months i have lost my job and everything that cane with it, also $35k of savings. this is in addition to the $1k i mentioned above. 
Got nothing to do so i wanted to cheer for other retards.

Edit: i live in EU. Christmas eve was yesterday*
I’ve seen enough of this autistic horseshit.  I’m in as of this morning and after reading this insightful perspective I do believe I shall yolo my life savings.

So true.  Merry Christmas my friend and most importantly Fuck You.  Hope you have a great holiday.
the SEC actually like to go after the small retail trader was they are easy target.
It does, but when you see the government adopting their battery swap stations and funding them directly it gives me confidence. Even the delisting news was some BS that rattled a lot of shareholders. I have a feeling that there is more behind the scenes going on and it has to do with the ANT ipo that got blocked last minute.
Look at this lucky mf that gets to pay taxes.
You gimme that 10k and then you can blow me... Wait, did I read that wrong?
Something tells me that an autist on wsb using Robinhood is not gonna get that fill.

Im telling you, you're making it sound like the postal service worker isn't good at his job. A lazy worker would for sure leave it in the locker if they could lol. No one wants to bring it back to the office and then bring it back out when you sign the slip for redelivery.
Started in April with 12k, still waiting for the “profitable” thing to happen and we are running out of time
502 @ 25 here. Had an initial purchase at 18 but kept averaging up as I found more cash to put in. Contemplating if there's any room to sell these soon and buy more during a dip but it's totally possible this thing never drops below 25 again anyway.
All in on TSLA
Can’t wait for the sub to collapse under its own weight, then the markets do the same, and WSB gets blamed for everything instead of the Fed
Respect bears? NOT EVEN ONCE
It’ll get better with time I had no idea what software to use but wanted to lmao
I saw one scattered list of small trades. There should be one 6k --> 100k trade, not sure why it's so difficult to just post it. It's a one month chart with 1 spike day over day.

My 1 month chart currently says I'm up 280% when in reality I'm not up that much. I withdrew money and it inflates the gain%.

More and more of that bullshit is popping up here
Im down 15k... Pls help with advise.. What should i do?
I’ve had July 21 25c positions for awhile, so those are nice

Got 28c 1/15 around $27 a few days ago.

35c 1/2022 is really tempting but I’m overleveraged enough on it lol
Yea but Amazon has them beat there too so why would anyone ever think to use GameStop
What the fuck
we're on the brink of what will probably be the most prosperous period of our lives

that's why the market is green and no one even cares what mango does to this bill

the best thing you can do right now is plan, the next decade is going to be insane
Hey wrong sub weird guy
Jan 2019. So just making it this long makes me more successful than most. Lost a few hundred bucks 2019 but wasn't that active and only put in like 1.5k. Started really trading in February and was pretty much even on the year until I hit on NIO in October-November and then clean energy the last month or so. Up 70% on the year, initially invested 9k. My main goal for the next few months is to ride my green energy for more gains and not get cocky and lose all my money, because realistically I still don't know anything

I was also here for the original "TSLA 420" memes, pre-split. Yeah wish I had bought in then
DKNG
$AAL $15 or under.
$A.P.X.T $13-14 or under.
$WFC $26-29 or under
$WBA $40 or under. 
$PLTR anything under $30 is all tendies.
U guys are doing research?
My first one was ZM calls. 1.5k -> 30k on an extremely OTM call. I still cant believe how lucky i got. Lost it all to docu the next week
Elf is a stock...
MMs encourages Hate and resentment
Down \~11k.
Exactly. That’s why it’s going to end up being some lame shit like Subway or something
Accurate. Can confirm.
I sell mine pretty far OTM but do weeklies, 20 delta. Thought they would be called away this week but it didn’t happen. I make about $150 premium a week and that’s with 300 shares. Just got assigned 300 more at $29 from selling ITM puts and 100% fine with it, I sold ITM purposely because I was almost certain my shares were going to be called away. At first I hated selling covered calls, but you really have to be okay letting them go if it happens, not a fan of rolling but that too is an option. You could do very well with 5400 shares and covered calls on pltr.
no, its like you never made it
are we getting another 🍉🍉🍉🍉🍉?
Same
buy shares and do a covered call on it if you’re scared
Started 3 weeks ago.. I had money saved and eventually hit a plateau. So put 15k in to force myself to save up again. Just started just doing regular shares and got to 17k. Discovered options and im now back to 15k. Love it..

The math works if you assume commodity prices stay at highs for months if not years at a time.. LOL. I guess this is the same math and logic that they used to finance 2008 oil boom.. "oIL pRiCeS onLy g0 uP".
Imo I don’t agree with them completely, or you completely. While I do think people deserve what they work for, I don’t believe anyone (bill, Elon, or Jeff for example) deserve to be as rich as they are. I don’t think anyone alive DESERVES that much wealth. Now I’m not saying let’s take it from them, I’m just speaking from a fundamental level - no one alive deserves to be richer than 99.99999999% of people.

That’s exactly what a marketing guy would say.

One of the worst memes I’ve seen on WSB.  It really sucks.  Having said that the effort was great.  At least you did it.  Not like the rest of the losers telling the meme creators how bad they are, like me.  Keep on doing it.  You’ll only get better.  Thanks for the effort amigo.  Some of us, not all, but I, appreciate your attempt.
sugary foods or salty foods?
If you are a sub mod and you auto mod the word "retarded"

You are gayer than the bears
Yo what up dude
I am proud of how much money I made trading this year. I am not proud I did it all in the same four pairs of shorts
Legit or with he?

That’s a lot of blowing, gl OP
I plan on doing it more. It’s safer than other kinds of trading. I had been curious about it for a while but just recently realized the logistics of only having to own it for such a short amount of time. Just need to know when the ex dividend dates are.

I wasn’t sure it was going to work but my dividend finally showed up in dividends receivable on webull about a week or so later.

Im flexing that a bit too but I've had it go sour. Kinda getting into leaps though.
Merry Christmas boys, y’all helped me fuck myself this year :)
Could've been full when they were there. A postal person would do everything in their power to put it in a locker instead of taking it back to the office. Lockers are heaven for em.
You can offset them only in the same year, or 3k per year for the next 7 years or so.
I can’t even enjoy Christmas because I keep thinking about how much my nio calls are going to drop on Monday. This sucks.

I would highly disagree with your statement "the average Joe is at a huge disadvantage" not when you realize you don't need a finance degree to make the same decisions that all the "professionals" make.. just as retarded as anyone else is, cept they get paid for it..

Was reviewing recentish trades I made with the extra time today.

Biggest kick in the dick was easily selling my x10 ICLN 24c 1/21 for 1.20 which was 100% gain at the time, that shit is 3.90 now.

Biggest thank fucking god was getting out of BABA 300c 1/2022 at $275, my buy in was $280ish on the way up before the probe and I only had a net ~15% loss on the trade

Biggest brain move was 1000 shares of ICLN at about 16.50 avg, that shit has out gained most of my option plays. Also shout out to DIS 170c 1/2023 bought at $130, I still can’t believe that went ITM in fucking 2020.
Real talk: if you actually want to do little research and actually keep your money put it in SPY.

tl;dr split it between pltr and gme
Damn stop calling me out like that 🤧
Anyone an expert on wash sale rules in here that wants to do my taxes and tell me what the hell I need to do next week. I feel like I have a dissertation coming up on the 31st that I haven’t studied for at all
I feel like every tattooer says they can do traditional then it ends up looking like dogshit
I truly believe PLTR is gonna make us a lot of the money, the kind of money that bumps you up a social class.

It’s a good play and I might dabble in myself. However, don’t overestimate the demand for vehicle conversions.  Zero emission vehicle are not mandated for older vehicles in places like California. If they were or if there was a nationwide mandate that ALL vehicles had to be zero emission, then this would be the biggest catalyst for this company but I highly doubt that. Although, it is possible for the feds to offer some sort of tax incentive to do so (remember cash for clunkers).

Actually wait...nvm. I’m all in!

I sometimes forget Reddit is not like WSB until I open it up and see this shit. 

I try to ignore it but nothing in this world pisses me off more than this kind of thinking. I know it’s mostly all out of financial ignorance so I don’t ever say anything but even still, the amount of hate people have for wealthy people is astounding. 

I’m not rich. I could definitely use 2k vs 600 in stimulus. But never in my fucking life would I try to advocate murdering bezos or whoever the meme hates this week. Like, it embarrasses me to watch another human so shamelessly display such intense jealousy for what another human has built.

To me, that sort of thinking just exemplifies the type of life a person like this lives—bitching in the dark with their hand out, trying to take from someone else instead of using their success as an example for building their own. It’s just super pathetic and cringy IMO. Like in high school when the ugly bitches don’t like the hot girl for no other reason than she is hot and the boys like her. 

That’s why WSB is great. We all know that we could be rich, but it’s our own fault that we aren’t. For us, it’s our degenerate gambling addiction, for them, it’s being a lazy fuck who thinks they deserve a cut of Elon’s steak just because it’s wagyu beef and they never had any before.

AMC it's going to need to slim down a fuck ton AND I could see investors giving them a shot. But it really all depends on how well WBs offerings on HBO Max occur.

Only 50?? What were they leaps
Converting all my USD to GBP.
Started back in college late 90s and quickly turned $10k to $35k. Then lost most of it when the dot com bubble burst. Kept account (which is now TD) and tried it all over again after law school when I had some extra money from my day job. Got caught up on the wrong side in 08-09 melt down and lost another $100k+ real quick. Had my first kid and decided to go the safe route with index funds since I’m a retard. Fool me once. Also hooked up with a guy to manage some of my money at Morgan about 4-5 years ago and also opened a Betterment account 4-5 years back and saw that crater this past March. Threw $200k into the TD account end of March and thought to myself third times the charm. Have about $180k realized gains and another $140k unrealized. *Have deposited additional funds over the past 9 months since it was earning .00000001% sitting in the bank and I wanted to take bigger positions. The average Joe is at a huge disadvantage vs. some of these finance guys so I know my gains is not because I’ve become some financial wizard but more luck, timing and a little DD. For every guy who “took $5k and turned it into $200k” there’s 1000 that lost it all. Don’t get sucked into the gains porn and shoot for the stars.
It all started, when I discovered options

You held an option for 5 minutes and took a 50% loss?

That was very autism.
NIO is pegged under $48. Large volume of asks from $48 - $50. Will be difficult to break through. Also, I know a lot about pegging.
Dude I light a few on fire and let the other ants take them back with them as a warning
Started when I saw the market starting to recover on this day 2 years ago. Then a few weeks went by and I was scrolling through reddit  and seent an office meme about which characters of the show represent  which sub. (We're ryan's) spent a month learning options on yt. Within the first week I sold pge
 at a loss right before it shot up and looked what I could of had. Never looked back. Lost 5k my first year on a yolo during the trade war that went South via trump tweet. Took a break just adding to my account for the next year holding shit stonks until I got up to 8k and started options again but smaller positions. Then in September I once again yoloed pge since it was moving again then it crashed 10% within hours of purchase. I got fired from my job on October 23 and my account was down to $630 on the 29th. I don't know if it was because I could stare at my phone all day or just dumb luck but I brought my account back from the dead and topped my account to $101,000 year to date when I sold fcel at damn near the top yesterday. Bought the fcel dip today on the first dip but it dipped a bit more. held over the weekend wish me luck retards

Lets say u buy the warrants at 4.5 and the commons at 16. If the commons price goes to 17.5, ull net +$1.50/common, or ~9% gain. The warrants should be around 6.00, would would net u 1.5/warrant, or ~33% gain. Thats what i mean when i said u can get higher returns for warrants

But even with the large number of internal systems creating massive amounts of data at every company being relatively “new,” the problem goes back to at very LEAST the dot com bubble and has only gotten worse. Palantir has been working on solving it for almost that entire time. People keep talking about the analytics palantir can provide being the value, but the real value is in integration and governance.

Couldn't agree more. Once you lock those gains, be patient, maybe step away for a few days. The markets will still be here when you get back.

Don't be me. I made +400% on QS calls my [first 2-3 weeks](https://i.imgur.com/W3jYtZ3.png). Lost 90% of my gains immediately after for shorting SPCE for no reason at all [the day after](https://i.imgur.com/HNA4hEg.png).

yes i snagged Feb calls. Today was the first day the 40-45-50 strikes were available. thats how new the stock is. again no one knows about this stock yet (outside of citron folllowers) because its christmas and most people arent trading. ill trim maybe 25% on the next pop to manage my risk but planning on holding till expiration or close to it.

On my corporate shit. Before 1/1/20 I had actually kept all my money in a high yield savings account. Middle class finance attitude. 

New Years... Moved $100k to Vanguard l, primarily total market funds, but picked 4 stocks I thought had good future potential. GOOG at $1300, NET at $17, GSHD at $42 and NVTA around $17... 

The shares plays went well. Of course my max investment in any of these was $4k. Still holding them all. 

Continued to have success in excess of what the market was doing, pandemic dip be damned and thought hey, what the fuck - if my own picks are beating the market, why not bet on myself?

Articles about RH and WSB piqued my interest. Made a deposit 10/1 and am 4x now. PLTR and various ARK related picks to thank. 

Found my comfort zone in low risk, high reward OTM calls 6-8 months out. Current picks include GME (🚀🚀🚀), CDXS, RAVN, FLIR. 

TLDR: I’ve been on WSB 3 months. 🚀 is already my most used emoji.
I’ll just be asking Santa to cover my margin

Started with $1500 in late October. Got called margin in my first day. Diamond handed it and eventually went to $24.000 thanks to NIO and PLTR mostly. Then my first huge red week came and i sold everything at the bottom so i was at $8000. Now  doubled in a week thanks to SPACS, sitting at $16.500

I play with CFDs , ty Europe. 

Btw not selling in loses, not anymore, fk paper hands. Now im DIAMOND HANDS AS FUCK
Holding your first one forever is a secret money hack, buffett accidentally discovered this with coke
Maybe it’s a scam.  In 1985 I almost fell for a company that said it invented a self refrigerating aluminum can.  You pop the top and the can would automatically make the soda or beer inside cold.  35 years later, we still don’t have that invention 😢 That said I am balls deep in PLTR
Delta simply means, "how does my position move in relation to the underlying stock." Shares have a delta of 1. Stock goes up a dollar, my position goes up a dollar. 

An option at the money usually has 0.5 delta. The further in the money, the closer to 1 it goes. the further out of the money, the closer to zero.
I just watched “Greenland.” It almost gave me the same rush I get during the trading day.

I agree, but I also don't need real time data very often for analysis. I do real time stuff when I'm on my lunch break if I need to/want to, which is mostly just looking for intraday entry points and targets.

RH is shit for it, but I also don't know how it's supposed to fit all the necessary data in a readable format on a phone screen.
I made 11k on a TSLA call that cost me $380 back in February 2020 on one of my very first options. I’ve had some up and downs, but nothing like that. I thought I was going to be a millionaire by the end of the year. Lots of paper hands, missed opportunities and stupid FD’s.
Feel like this is this sub every day now

They have to be shooting for something smarter than just search, not sure how close they are to anything amazing yet though.

To be clear, I'm not bearish on PLTR, just asking questions that I think should be asked.

Don't agree with your premise that "some things shouldn't be in the cloud."

I've personally built (not alone obv) high security gov regions and private corp regions.  All the big players have this. Just because it's cloud doesn't mean it's standard public security, or even connected to the public internet.  Some I can't login to anymore myself even though I helped build them, others just have a subset of employees that can operate them, etc.

The big JEDI contract that's gotten so much attention the past few years isn't gonna be running on public cloud, but it is cloud.

Wife and I decided to push off buying a house so started late October with a measly $500 deposit. Realized buying shares was easy. Then I dumped 10k into my account and now I’m at a 97% return in 2.5 months. Positions are 40% TSLA 20% SQ 10% AMD 10% LMND 10% ABNB.

Used some profit to put a down deposit on a Model Y. Life is easy in a bull market.
Who is “they”? And why are you wasting time trading when **YOU** could be starting your own SPAC to launch Sauce Boss (SOSS) to bring it to market?
I started in my college dorm back in March. Everyone had been kicked out but I was allowed to stay cause I was an out of state student. I didn’t have a job. All I had was $1,000 to last me until things got better. I started to invest and now I can average about $30 a day. And this sub really helped.

East coasters go to bed so Santa can come
Nice haul. Extra Christmas presents this year for sure
I am bullish too, but agreed.  Need consumer space to become most valuable company in the world.  Govt and private business alone (if they get get there) will never be enough.
Investing in GME is like investing in libraries
You have been officially canceled for your insensitive hate speech
Gratz! Already saw this at least once
Yeah what a bad analogy unless the DD is that it’ll hit 20 and stay there forever.
ofc, and AGNC can lose value each year and still be profitable. but since inception it's avg -2%. with a 9%+ dividend, that doesn't beat SPY
I know what you mean
Boy those are going to mega print 😤😤💎💎🚀🚀🚀🚀

LOL Tesla growing 15% YOY?

You’re stupid
Honest answer.

Edit: also happy holidays.
Shit when it’s close to 20. But I never sell on whole numbers (big rule that’s helped out). So, I’ll sell around 18.50.
🤣🤣
Merry Christmas, hope y'all hit multiple 10-baggers in 2021. 

Lmao JK you'll all lose your money
Started at March with $1000 blew it to around $200 yoloed it on PayPal calls on earnings and made 2k, then took it to around $17,000 at the peak when the fed started printing money. Lost half of it on the second mid correction now trying to get steady gains.
Yo, that’s not a terrible idea
None of that is remotely politically incorrect in Detroit. Lol. Fg is just barely starting to become not ok. Thanks Eminem.
Imagine how boomers feel lol
Humble brag incoming since I can’t tell any friends or family, you are all my collective degenerate ‘friends’ that look at money as just a number on a screen: https://imgur.com/a/xRoadaj 🍻

So buy Puts until this power struggle gets handled got it 220p
Started in March . Had 14k in the bank and got a interest of .05 cents and was very upset . After that I took off buying Sony, SSL,FLUOR
Bought Jan 250 calls at 216
Yep 100%, it definitely helps that I would rather do this than anything else. If it felt like a chore or job I’d prolly lose interest. Best of luck to you.
If it's shorted this hard, who tf are they buying from? Market makers who are also shorting in order to provide liquidity?
