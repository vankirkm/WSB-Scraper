Strange that alibaba does stock buybacks on a ticker that reddit declared worthless
I don’t understand why by people are bullish on the Chinese sector when time after time again the CCP and Beijing regulators have reminded people that while the market is a necessity it is evil and will be ruled by monarchs in Beijing palace who know nothing of economics. Shit is regulated criminally over there, play in China get rich or get burned pussies.

I put my whole 8700 into Tesla got it up to about 9500. Put 7 of that into pltr and have it up to 10,050 so far. Was up to 10,450 ish but naturally didn’t sell lol. All well. Still up over all

My buddy who lost 20k on BA option.
[deleted]
lol. That’s cute that you think the SEC has any real power. They’re not the IRS
at the end of the day i have average intelligence at best. Im trusting that Coke, Fedex, DHL did their DD. And the price is low relative to other EV SPACs QS, VLDR, LAZR, NKLA for example. Great rrisk to reward. and i got long dated options the very first day they were available. I think with so many SPAC's its information paralysis but once this one becomes more well known it will emerge as a winner.
Started in June and having a background in finance  I thought I was somewhat of a savant in the stock game. 

First month I was down -40% and cried myself to sleep on most nights. 

Peaked at around +180% at the end of August and thought to myself...Yes! I really am a fookin genius! 

Then the first couple of days of September rolled around and I went down to +100%. I did not sell because why sell when I could sell for +180%, right...? Fast forward a week later and I was actually down -20%. Another genius move by the savant. Fookin peasants. I was playing 4-d chess while everyone else was playing dominoes pizza. 

Sold most of my positions and now I'm hovering around +40%.  Lambo here we come.
Long PLTR... HEAVY... with shares and $50 call LEAPS

But just following the way GME is probably really pressing the short sellers to make a serious move, probably GME for the short term
May you live in interesting times

Right on man. You always read time in the market is the best teacher and I’m taking the same approach to steep myself in this everyday.
We’re all gonna make it brah
Lost a lot of gains in my account due to the fucking CCP
Old ass boomer, scrimp and save all my life, started with 700k, yolo them into FSLY and TSLA last year and this year, bought 20k and 280 shares of FSLY and TSLA, at around $24 and $800, respectively. Now I'm sitting on 3.5 mil portfolio.

Just went for clothes shopping, walked around for an hour and only left with a pair of $20 pants from Costco that were on sales. Yesterday I dropped 3k on 0 DTE GME calls. Now I sell naked TSLA calls like a complete retard. Something never changes.
At least you aren’t holding CRM

Buying PLTR when it drops. I have 1520 PLTR on webull.
Oh 

1. deposit the cash in your bank account


2. sign up for robinhood 


3. add your bank account


4. Instant deposit into Robinhood account and invest
Buy closer to the money on decent stocks. Analyze every trade you win or lose on, find out why, and definitely try to spot trends in yourself. If you're 8/8 on losses, you're way too optimistic/pessimistic or buying too close to expiration. Random chance should be giving you better results than that.

Look at the history of the underlying, see if they have any news coming up, and inspect the charts. Should help you out picking safer/more profitable options as well as stocks.
PLTR. It’s a real company with a real ceo in a good industry

GME is shit and people are gambling on a short squeeze.... lol
Thanks dude, you too!
Someone make me feel better about holding APHA
Started with 3k of internship money that grew to 9k of contributions in my roth ira. The initial 3k was all in SPY until i found chicken singapore genius on YouTube who convinced me to buy tesla. I eventually went 80/90% tesla around june and now my accounts at 25k! 
I also have 7k in my rh that i had 100% in shares until i found you fucks. Proceeded to lose and gain 1k on tesla calls, and have been learning a lot. Now i own 100 shares of GME(exercised a call), a june ARKG 105c, a few MT 2/19/21 20c and a 2023 PLTR 30c

this guy sold tesla before earnings and got a fraction of the gains lol
Don’t have a usb-c charger so I need to go buy one on top of my AirPod purchase 🗑
Thanks. Santa decided to be nice this year.
I try and look at it as percentages. 5-6% is a good return. If I can hit 10 I'm doing amazing. If I hit 20 I'm buffet tier. I like to delude myself that I can do that with enough plays where I get a 50% return on that play.
exactly...thats not in 8 minutes that in 12 hours
That's an added 33% loss. 200/600 = 1/3

So with 2k it'd be about $2.6k loss
what happened to my karma
600 attached to defense spending bill, but maybe another 2k of trump signs it asap
It was first with long some shares, then yes combination of butterflies, condors,
Bought some $10 OTM weeklies on MRNA because why not

Daaamn, dude was gunning for retirement with one trade. GG.

Still got 12k, get back in there champ
  r/gaystreetbets
the risk/reward is just too good to pass up. its only at 4.5B mkt cap with real deal Dow Jones type of clients. Worst case i see it dropping to maybe like $25/share temporarily by shorts/profit takers? while i can see this going 60 or higher easily.

And Citron's record for longs is pretty good like RH and JMIA. Rh in particular has been a banger.

Remember $NKLA pumped like a madman when the GM news dropped.Even tho GM backed out they are still worth more than XL.  XL already has those clients, and many of them. FEDEX, DHL, Coke, Pepsi. Real clients from real blue chip corporations.

I believe XL will pump bigly once more ppl find about them. I mean they went public during Xmas week which is the lowest volume of the entire year so i really think most people dont know they exist. Yet.
Christmas is gey I want more gains! My gifts are no match for a 10 bagger!
I'm 70/30, heavy on the PLTR side.
280 something GME shares  (AVG 16.84) and 8 contracts in game, 5 Jan 15 $17 and 1 $16 April with 2 $29 April.

Limit set to sell 200 shares at $100. May buy more shares after GME dips and either reinvest in GME shares or maybe consider either PLTR, MT, possibly TSLA if I’m brave enough, or wait for the next retard that gives some good fucking DD.
People with jobs don't always have this option and Robin provides absolute shit data.

Tomorrow is Christmas! The time of the year where everyone goes home and gathers around a turkey with their family in order to try to talk them into buying PLTR so that we see a 10%+ gap up on Monday. Christmas is a magical time!
Of course you can have both, just curious which has the edge in the next month or so?

Bro man, you're killing me smalls. I think there's some very basic thing you're missing here if you're still on this hill.

Spy:big etf, reliable, low dividends, low risk, will always trend to marginal growth

Individual stocks: varying degrees of reliability and safety (from dividend king value stocks to reits to whatever else), higher dividends, and a clear variation between different companies in terms of potential growth of the underlying, ie higher risk

The fuck are you arguing? If you pick the right dividend stocks you'll make more money boomer investing than if you just bought spy. The risk obviously being picking the right stocks. Though fuck if dividends are what you want get the best of both worlds and just buy sphd for more security and a bit less divi returns
Don’t know which dude you are talking about, but I regret telling my wife.

Pretty much yes. Options are always priced based on a number of factors; mainly the volatility and price of the security. 

OP bought his options a while back which at the time were fairly low in price due to GME not performing so well... He bought them from someone willing to sell in exchange for cash. 

Now, the price of these options has skyrocketed due to GME mooning. He can turn around and sell these exact same options under his control to someone else for 2000%-4000% more than he originally paid. 

Folks he is selling to are likely speculating as OP did in the past, just on a different timeline and cost basis. 

Hope it makes sense

Call it education expenses.  Let it motivate you to learn and figure this out, because you can.

You can give up, which only guarantees you will never have gains again, or use this experience to your advantage.

I’m not saying to keep throwing good money away right now because you clearly don’t know what you are doing.  Save money.  Learn, analyze, and even paper trade until you develop a strategy that works.

Also, never ever follow this crowd.  We use the word “retard” around here prolifically for a reason.

Sorry for your losses.  Keep your chin up and watch from the sidelines and rest for a bit before you head back into the game.
Anything for my emperor mango
I'm definitely open minded.

Our current tax scheme is failing us because of complexity and loopholes, so anything that reduces that is a good idea.

Honestly stressful as fuck sometimes but that’s what you get for being a 🤡 just tryna blow up to be able to get past that 25k limit. Would like 30k so I can just day trade 1k for scalps to make consistent money. I use my girls robinhood with her money to make her money, decent and consistent profits for a fucking boomer or some shit but I can’t yeet hers  otherwise I won’t be able to have her day trades or portfolio to fuck with.
So whoopty doo, dickery dock, lick my balls and suck on my cock
That’s it, I’m camping out on the couch for this morherfucker tonight. Not this time buddy
Own several businesses. I'd only recommend this if you're willing to work several years away. I make great money for my age, but the quality of life is almost nonexistent.
I’m thankful for my calendar which says the time to be thankful was last month you dumb slut

Yeah, plus a complicated society doesn’t help.

Im sure youd be on the frontlines, right? The frontlines at Arby's.
Can’t wait to start seeing them roll off the assembly line. I plan to move to an electric pickup in 22 or 23 and can’t wait to see what’s available at that point.
$17 nice support level, i'll be adding there and at $15 as well. I'm thinking the big squeeze happens sometime between feb and september next year.
honestly i think it just need more publicity and itll rise the q1 earning are gonna skyrocket with all the tired parents buying their kids stuff so they can fuck off the rest of quarantine
For me, I don’t know, that’s like a coo weekend. But like $2000...? That would be nice... I could start my own business, maybe buy me a used car and stuff even. Maybe get me a laptop with four big flatscreens an’ shit.
Imagine buying a new pair of AirPod pros and they don’t include a charging brick for the sake of “cutting down on emissions.” 🤡 Fuck you, Apple shareholders. Sincerely, someone who just spent $240 on AirPod pros.

Was investing like a boomer all in REITs and GLD. 

Got into active trading in July. Buy high sell low like a retard and was down 20-30%. Finally made that back in the past few days. Gains so far mostly from XPEV and GME. Lost moneys from BABA. 

All in ARKs now. Cos Mama Cathie makes better choices than i do.
Been building my account this year( first year investing). Was doing great, mostly because I got into square as my first buy at 85$ and that is by far my best gainer this year.  Had a couple good day trades in oil also early in the year but have left it alone for a while.  All in all I was up about 30% for the year at the start of December.  Then I found WSB and figured out about options. Now I’m up 9% on the year. I did fall into the red right after I started trading options but recovered some. I found out I don’t like weeklies.

I kinda think he assumes he can lock himself inside the White House and that the feds won’t make it to him.  I don’t really know at all, but I’m positive that DC would have an enormous surplus of military and police in the area.. who are probably specifically trained for some idiot assault.

There probably isn't a better place in the world to advertise shitty p&d stocks than right here because 95% of you hop on each bandwagon with no DD past the ticker.

You're a fool if you can't see how this pumped the stock. Within an hour of this post the price and volume went through the roof.

And the number of shares he holds has absolutely no bearing on it pumping. He could pump the stock with a paper trade account just by posting here while not even owning a single share.

Everyone else in the comment section can see it. You're one of the tiny minority that don't see it right in front of you.

It's the late stage capitalism result of dogmatic adherence to the idea that "the shareholder is always right." Honestly, I've been saying for years that GameStop needed to pivot to functioning as a games community center because of their strong real estate and foot traffic-- become something between an arcade and a LAN center, and that's exactly what "GameStop 2.0" was supposed to be, except it seems to have just been in test markets. If they actually pull off that relaunch, I think they have an actual shot.
I started in April of 2020, I thought I could start by buying spy cheap and let it build over time. Then you retards told me to buy puts in spy, and I did. Lost all my money. But after watching this sub, checking all the DDs I got all my money back

Well at the time corona virus was just beginning to be treated as a real serious deal in the USA. When I read the post, we were in the stage where the government was in denial, calling it a hoax, calling it media hype, and generally laughing it off. The dudes post was made in Jan and I saw the screenshot in feb. 

he didn’t really say why March specifically, just said the crash was imminent and gave early/mid March as timing. 

My guess is I think he knew about some coming announcement or something that would panic the markets

There was an enormous sell off of stocks right before the crash from Congressmen who got the briefing early, and that rippled out to other people in the high level financial sectors. He said he worked at a large capital firm or something and was giving this info to 4chan.
Is it difficult to jerk off to this with those hands made of diamond.

I don’t read books or anything. Kinda just picked up TA from various sources here and there. It’s not that hard. Where I primarily benefited was watching stuff every single day. I kept a watchlist of about 20-30 stocks. After awhile you just get a feel for their price and how the numbers move / work. With constantly looking at shit on here or other subs, discords, etc. you’ll come across tickers you know are undervalued. Seriously, having millions of people sharing thoughts and ideas on this sub is invaluable. I always always want to hear others thoughts on tickers I’m interested in. Maybe they see something I don’t?

Edit: I guess I should add, I have a Finance degree lol. That probably helps. But only a little bit.

honestly im feeling a pullback soon to $17, i'd sell and rebuy these once volatility collapses again, or roll these into shares/ITM april calls.

The real question is how long will that last......
Started around May 2020 after covid crash and was mostly into safe stocks and etfs and all that bullshit. Finally decided to go more risky after holding stupid shit like banks and dividend payers. I dropped to about even in late September early Oct but then was going pretty risky starting Sept. Gain about 30% realized and unrealized gains. Mostly unrealized. Got 65k in tda and 1.2k in robinhood to mess around with options.
Started with $40k in Feb 2020 and grew it to $1.75M today. Will post a longer version of my story tomorrow morning, look forward to it

No PRPL right now, although I did land some coin playing max pain for Dec.

PSTH.   There’s some very interesting structures you can play with options right now that have a very high probability of 2x-4x, with very, very little downside risk.   I spent some quality time on the phone with the TOS margin department to find out exactly how close to the red line I could get stacking up these plays.

The plays are easily replicated across pre-merger SPACs with options, so I’m there too.
Yeah I’m good I’ll keep risking it
What the hell they offered me $60, $200, and $600 for a 25k loss from march outage. At $600 they basically kept replying with $600 when I said I needed more to sign their document.

Anyways 8 months later FINRA replied to my case with a guide on how to avoid getting scammed.

FALSE. The Sony and Bose ones in the mid $200 range are just as good if not better. Do you even Amazon review bruh?
Well i got something for ya and if you stick around i think you’ll like it
Does anyone here know about taxes? 

I blew up my robinhood account like 5 years ago and lost 8k, I never claimed it as a loss since I didn't know anything about taxes. I'm up $1900 this year on stocks can I still deduct the 8k I lost like 5 years ago or is it too late and now I have to pay tax on this $1900? Or is the $1900 small enough that I dont need to worry about paying taxes on that?
Yeah bro lmaoo, the older and more ‘mature’ I get the more I realize how much of a bitch she really is lol. Why does it feel like that’s every step mom? 🤔

I live in auto exec city. No cyber trucks but we have the mustang EV, F150 EV, and GM concept cars everywhere rn. See some weird looking shit on the roads. Gotten my ass beat by engine swapped bullshit too lol.  GM is fond of shoving their prototype engines into bullshit cars to test them.
What resources do you use to study?
Started in August after having Robinhood for months and only have $100 in there. I just turned 18 and finally got access to my savings from my parents and had some cash saved up. Threw $1000 in there, made a little, discovered options, realized I needed more in my account. Now I'm here with $2000 in my account. Bought BABA, PLTR, PLUG calls last month and was up 2k until I got too cocky. Dropped below 1k but I'm back to 1.3k. Holding THC🐝 shares and GME calls over this weekend, manifest for me.
Merry Christmas 🎄

Managing risk is how you keep the money you make. People see the crazy moonshots in portfolio and want to emulate and get fucked.

Consistent 10% average return is a guaranteed way to make money. Options are a fun and exciting way to add to that, but shouldn't even be a majority of the strategy (unless selling them covered/secured, because that's just easy money).

Fuck if I don't like big numbers red or green, but I'd rather not be the red one, even if I sacrifice a bit of green.

I've been browsing here for a while, traded Canadian weed stocks few years back as it was being legalized made a little profit. Other than that...nothing else since I got too busy with work and was scared..until now.  I spend 5 days a week working from home so this is a great distraction and lifts my mood in a weird way.

I went on a horrible date back in the summer where the guy was a total idiot but made a good call investing in Moderna and made a ton of money and it piqued my interest, if this idiot can make money, why can't I?

I'm not an expert at all, but this is a great distraction from work life in COVID times. I work in sales and some of my customers (oil and gas, airline, hockey teams) have also been directly impacted by COVID, falling oil prices, BLM (defunding the police) and knowing about stocks goes hand in hand with knowing about the world you live in, what's happening globally and which direction the future is headed and all of this is fascinating to me. And of course, I want to make money. I will report back if I make any profit. 😅I signed up for the PLTR hype (work in tech sales and data is the most important commodity and AI is at the forefront so I see their value), MT, a little GME, and maybe Workhorse.
What’s nio day? New to wsb.
Damn it’s Covid Facts Guy AGAIN
Used to trade options before WSB was around then got a job in finance that prevents me from trading so now I come here to just live vicariously through you retards. Keep up the great work and I’m  rooting for WSB’s takeover of GME or some small cap
Well, I guess I feel like I gotta please everyone. The step side of the family is all about “formalities”, yknow getting the family together for board games and shit. I get drug into that, when I primarily want to just spend time with my mother. Who was the only one who really raised me... dads a whole ‘nother story. I’m obviously older now tho and I could just say no... but like I said it’s hard for me to do that. It’s prolly hard to understand if you’re not in my situation.

Started options trading in June by taking the 30k of my E*TRADE acct and converting 100% from equities to options.  Sitting on 65k now!  Would be sitting on like 90+ except I bought TSLA puts at 200 ($1000 pre split and my buddy and I were convinced it was the ceiling 🤣🤣🤣) and just 2 weeks ago and neither worked out.  But this is an exciting hobby if nothing else.

Nobody else wanted the position.
Its funny and cute fuck off scrooge mc-cuck
Ok I’m not going to quit my job and trade options full time. That was a really stupid idea. I got caught up in watching everyone’s gain porn on here.
Question. Palantir more or less overvalued than TSLA?

My opinion is it's more overvalued overall. I'm not hating the PLTR gang btw, just trying to figure shit out.  


I don't know enough about it, admittedly.
Didn’t trade options until I did, then yolod 60,000 during the trade talks last year. Made it to 450,000, them back down to 30,000. Got some therapy, repaired my marriage, then shorted the market again when the virus hit. Sold a bit too early and bought the dip a bit too late but enough to come out with around 250% gain for this year.

Started in March out of boredom and no sports to gamble on. Put 100k in account and dabbled a bit with stocks only. Modest gains until August when I started trading options. Had a steady rise since then. My wife thinks I’ve lost my mind but I’ve turned 100k into 250k in 10 months. Got in early on some stocks:

PLTR... 1k shares at $10 another 1k at $9 and finally 1.25k at $18
ZM at $295
QS at $35.35
LAZR at $10.38
SPCE at $17
GOEV at $11

I’m full blown addicted now to trading and am truly scared for what a normal market might look like.

I work in a hospital and starting medical school next fall. The ICU s are not full and only very old people are dying. I’m using Florida as an example. Florida numbers are low and their governor said he won’t shut down the state. As a result, the economy is doing well down here. You’re pretty stupid if I had to spell that out for you. Restaurants don’t survive if they have to work at 50 percent capacity. This is high school Econ man. People still spend money if there is a virus or not. The shutdowns and uncertainty caused the market crash. If infection rates are so high and the virus cause the market to crash, why has the market skyrocketed the past 6 months???
Don’t sweat. My ICLN call went down for like 4-5 days straight and then flew and now I’m up 150%, patience :)

I have crippling depression
The shelf offering of $100 million is less than 5 million shares at current price. It was 6.25 million shares back when the price was $16.

Those 5 million shares can drive the price down to $17 in the worst possible apocalyptic case scenario. More realistically, if it gets released on Monday for example, it sends the stock down to test the $19 support, which can hold on its own.

So, that's just a minor bump on the road now that the valuation has grown to $1.4 billion.

I do share at least some of the "sell before earnings" sentiment, so let's just simplify it by saying I agree. Selling before earnings is GENERALLY a good thing to do. I never lost any money doing it, I only lost money when I held through earnings, and I'm not talking just GME, I held a lot of different stocks through earnings, which costed me several expensive lessons... Never again.

But, the 'they're losing money' argument is getting fixed by increased cash flow from console sales and eventually lower expenses due to the closure of 1000 unprofitable stores. They will be profitable and just watch, that's all Wall Street is gonna ultimately talk about, because they are short sighted, like they like to be.

Revenue will be up quite a lot, maybe even 1 billion higher 2020 and continuing to rise further in 2021. There's unprecedented demand for new consoles, demand outweighs supply, so however many they get assigned, they'll sell. And GME can actually afford to charge more than MSRP and get away with it (it would be stupid not to do so).

If you're going by revenue multiple, then this is a 7 billion market cap company already XD. I guess you meant earnings multiple, but even then, this can easily climb into 3, maybe even 4 billion territory just based on those numbers alone.

Wall Street never goes farther than 12 months into future, so they're gonna start valuing in those new, increased revenues/earnings, just like it's been happening every time before during the peak next-gen console cycle. Nothing's fundamentally change with Wall Street's short sighted projections since between 2013 and now.

It's foolish not to have at least some exposure to this stock. Fine, don't go all in, maybe that's really for us retards, but at least dip in a lil bit, it makes total sense.
Correct, I've seen so many people make so much fucking money this year on dumb sharemarket plays, I know one who doubled their net worth on Air New Zealand, in a pandemic where 90% of their aircraft are parked up, when the airline was cutting its workforce in half and still hemorrhaging somewhere in the region of $80 million per month, "60 cents a share felt cheap so I bought as many as I could afford and they doubled"

My personal risk tolerance says hell fucking no, but you can't say a win isn't a win here.
This is the way

Started in September with 6k. Had solid companies but sold them to buy options. Down about 50% could have been up 100% if I kept my shares. I’m 18
How long? I tried on a few monthly, but I'm talking a few hundred bucks and took my losses when it didn't move the way I needed after two weeks. Realized that's just absurd so now I'm looking more for yearly or 18 month options. Very expensive but I see the potential for huge gains, and in 6 months if you're worried about it just take your losses before theta decay completely destroys you.
The Chinese overlords will make an example out of Baba. All American investors will lose money not the Chinese. They still have the company doing the same business & revenue for years to come. But baba will be trading below $150 in 2 months. Because all the Chinese overlords have puts in baba.

Real talk, my grandpa died and I inherited 40k after spending 9k on dumb shit and watching the rest barely grow in a CD I decided to get curious with the market. 2018 invested 20k with my dads friend in his fund. Then in 2019 put 5k on RH. Turned it into 11k in March/June. Have since lost all of it. Back in with 1500 that’s now 2700
ah, you bought these? duuuude. why? they were pumped into the s&p and market had it set up for a first day or two dump.
Started trading with borrowed money.   From the government.

Realized $3.5M in gains this year.   Sitting on somewhere between $1.5M-$2.9M more by the end of March.   It’s been a good run, but I think I’m just getting started.

Been following boomer advice for years and socking away all my money in index funds in my 401k. Opened a robinhood account on a lark about a month ago  with $450 just to see what happens. bought some PLTR right at all time high. Tried to make some quick cash on AMC stimmy bump but that didn't go how I wanted. Then I put it all on a weekly GME call right before it jumped from 16 to 20. Sold after 2xing my money. GME dipped later that afternoon, bought some more GME 20c 12/31 which was out of the money, woke up next morning and it was up 150%. Didn't panic sell which I should have, it fell precipitously. Bounced up a couple times since but never as high as that morning. Still didn't sell. Currently I'm up about 20% and I feel cheated that I only made 20% in the last couple days...

Yes i make a fair amount of income with my wife so avoiding taxes is a great thing i always short term my losses and long my winnings when they become sizable.

Short term taxes are below a year and are taxed as income on that year.  Losses reduce your income on the year.

Long term capital gains is fixed bases on your income.  0% if you make below $40k above that its 15% and then rich folks above ~$500k yearly income its 20%

Started during the March crash. Bought SPY puts at the advice of a buddy, literally at the bottom, lost $800 off the rip (I held it to expiration LOL). Then the addiction started. There hasn’t been a single day I haven’t looked at the market since. I’ve studied, not even because I just wanted to make my money back, I genuinely like this shit. With that, I started to become good at it. I’ve since erased that loss and I’m now up 700% all time. Taking it day by day, trying not to get too impatient. I won’t be satisfied till I make a mill. Did I say I love this shit? I will most likely do it until the day I die. At least 50% of my day includes studying different tickers / markets / learning new things. I guess you could say I’m truly autistic. Maybe it works out for the best, maybe not. I’ve always been interested in the stock market as a young kid, but I never thought I’d be on this thread, sharing this story with retards. This place has made me the trader I am I think.

*DOUBT*
Fancy way of saying that your dollar goes further with options because you’re leveraging the potential gains (and losses) of one hundred shares without having to come up with an equivalent amount of capital. If options are a wheel, then Delta is the “traction” it makes with the ground. More delta, more gains (or losses) that correspond with the movement of the underlying
Thats great. Hopefully i get to 100k so i dont have to fork over extra cash because i ordered the tri motor
Basically, you win, you pay the full tax. You lose, the government still wants to tax you.

I don’t really have the money to blow. I’m just frustrated with how my portfolio has been run and my ego wants to pull better returns in 2021 than this clown pulled in 10 years.
I pretty routinely sacrifice upside for a guaranteed win. I've had a few go to the moon after, but I've also seen them tank, so I'm sticking with it for money I actually care about.

Worked 14 years for a fortune 500 company and they shopped me out to another company two years ago.  I took my 45k of their stock grants and cashed out then.  Waited for the right moment to get into the market, which was March 12th for me. With my job now work from home, I could focus on my new found trading when I was supposed to be working for my shit company.  I dabbled in stocks and did ok, but learned options back in June and got lift off 🚀 in August.  Was dreaming about early retirement and freedom, but Sept 2nd and the rest of Sept was a humbling experience.  I have worked my way back up to over 100% YTD, but still scared to YOLO ever again.

A buy order won't go through.  But if your call was already itm you can exercise I think?
Started Feb 2020 and put in 2.5k. In 4 months I turned that into $30k after buying the dip and riding DIS and DKNG up, then timing the June Airlines pump literally perfectly after Buffett dumped them. 

Lost $20k after that because I got greedy and stayed bullish on the airlines, cashed out and have been tossing small amounts of money around at meme stocks every month or two ever since. Haven’t had a real winner since September and am currently gambling with GME

Up isn’t the only way people make money. I’m trying to tell people to consider this as a strategy.
It could go either way, but there’s a higher chance the stock bounces back up. This isn’t some penny stock or some garbage company. This is the Amazon of China and the issue is minor when you consider their service and the future they’ll deliver. But to each their own. Enjoy :)

He posted 3 consecutive posts asking for jack a lot to be removed. I'm all for free speech, but making false accusations, threatening to shut down this sub and snitching to the SEC is a bit much.
This is like when a certain young man was rejected by the Vienna artist community....SAD!
That’s me!
Over the last few years I managed to YOLO away 30K total. Took the 3k a year deduction and this year I am up over the amount I still can deduct. So basically, that will wash out and I will owe taxes on the amount over my losses from previous years. Not the full 40K I have made.
Thats not how it works. Throw that ideology out and never think about it again

Yes but there is ALWAYS opportunity in the market if you do the work to find it. Sometimes it may just mean going short instead of long. My idea is certainly not an easy one to attain but it is possible. If nothing else I feel that it establishes a baseline for a disciplined strategy. Try to capitalize on momentum stocks for a quick gain rather than swinging for home runs. Key is to not chase losses. Being unable to admit you were wrong is what holds most people back IMO.

I had heard a lot about the Robinhood game, so I decided to download it from the app store.  Kinda weird that the game needed my wife's bank account (she handles the finances lol) instead of a credit card, but I know some of these "Alternate Reality" game apps can be quite convincing for the immersion factor.  I loaded some "V-Bucks" or "RH Cash" or whatever the call their monopoly money bullshit onto it and started typing in random letters to see what kind of weird shit they came up with.  The game seems to have a bunch of real companies on it too, I guess to keep up the reality illusion so that was kind of cool.  

I ended up losing the $10k on my first couple days and I keep hitting the "Start Over" button that all the red lines point to, but it hasn't reset yet.

I also think that they need a better tutorial, I went into the options menu to try and turn down the difficulty and instead of sliders and stuff like other games, i had to choose what percentage or something and I could set prices for the "stocks" but it just took money off my character and the stock prices haven't changed...

your strategy sucks, and you know it does based on your return. Either change it or dont do it lol
Maybe people who use PLTR installed on prem. Some things shouldn’t be on the cloud. 

To your point, if it’s just a massive search and aggregation platform, they’ll be toast. 

If they can dig deeper, like use NLP to extract context and link things, then it’s different. Also, look at what modern eDiscovery can do with AI, Predictive Coding, etc. you can have an attorney read 10,000 emails or just 100 with AI’s assistance. If you’re hoovering up a shit ton of unstructured text (email) this is helpful. Otherwise, it’s overwhelming. 

If they’re just searching, meh.
Just so we are clear... all Chinese stocks operate this way. NIO etc. Large financial institutions understand this and invest anyway. Quit trying to act like this isn’t common knowledge to the majority of institutions that bought into something with a 700 billion dollar market cap.
bro i’m 14k down man, teach me your ways, still got 9k left of my saving to flip (losing 14k of your savings at 18 is tuff)
People also said no one would ever buy a $1,000 phone, a $3,000 laptop or a $5,000 monitor with a separate $999 stand. Apple knows its base, they’d buy a $10,000 buttplug molded out of Tim Cook’s butthole

Just so we are clear... If you purchased BABA you bought ownership in a company in the Cayman Islands that has a contract with Alibaba to pay out profits. If China says they want to do what is in the best interest of China (this is a very Communist position (China is Communist)) and they ignore the contract than BABA shares get you an office chair in the Cayman Islands to split with every other person that owns BABA.

That actually might be doable right now in this market if you're super lucky. But this will not be the new normal. Things are going to turn downward or stagnate.

No offense and good job on the presentation this seems like a pump scheme. I assume you work for the company because this way way too bullish and you’re literally part of a cerner subreddit. Your company’s stock has trading sideways since the March drop, which means the options you’re posting aren’t going to yield much unless there’s a miracle. Cerner isn’t the only EHR and health care data provider, this is a competitive space. So my question is, are you trying to push up the stock price by increasing the call option volume so you can dump the stock?
I do not support this statement.
Yeah well, pump & dump or not, he at least hasn't lost me any money like those paid Wall Street & government shills have done earlier this year. I'm not gonna automatically say he's innocent of any wrongdoing just because I'm collecting some expensive breadcrumbs behind him, but I'm gonna give him the benefit of the doubt at the very least. Innocent until proven guilty or sumshit...

Human beings are not rational. 2 days ago I posted multiple comments here saying "no way I'm holding GME in 2022". Today I'm saying "fuck, GME might actually be a 2022 play too, if this and that happens..."

So, Occam's Razor makes it perfectly plausible our beloved jacker has figured "hey, I can actually make more money here in the short term, then come back later to GME and own even more shares"

I haven't looked too deep into it cuz I can't be truly bothered, but somebody commented somewhere that, based on the interesting event timeline this week, he might've actually lost out on a hefty chunk of the recent GME gains, between the $16-$20 price point. So, even if he did truly pump and dump, he chose the worst possible moment to do so, so I guess that would be karma or sumshit, I dunno...

It wasn't very long ago when I made ~1500$/month. My monthly expenses were ~700$/month (Canadian). I lived with roomates and I was a cheap ass. Everything else was saved / invested. 

I never understood this concept that poor people can't save. You just live somewhere you shouldn't be, and you're not putting effort into spending less. I took the bus. I ate cheap foods. I constantly searched for sales. I owned a "dumb" phone until I was able to "upgrade" for next to nothing. My computer was a second hand POS. 

Explain to me why a poor person is entitled to modern luxuries? What luxuries do they provide others?

Literally nothing is stopping you from entering the middle class. The government gives out student loans like Candy. You can goto community college, learn how to be a welder or whatever, and it'll literally be only be a couple years until you get a nice paying job with potential.

That's nuts.  People have really become entitled.

More lighthearted Wendy's story:

About 25 years ago my dad drove through the Wendy's drive thru lane and asked for Tacos.  The speaker was garbled so he couldn't make out what the worker was saying.  So he kept asking for his taco bell order (Taco bell was next door).  Eventually he made out the worker screaming 'Sir, We dont have any tacos!' then he realized he was in the wrong lane and got really embarrassed and drove off.  He cracks up when I mention it now.

There is nothing wrong with taking excessive amounts of risk right now. However, taking your entire stack and throwing it isn’t excessive, it’s retarded. He won, great. I know a lot of gamblers that win and more than lose. Let’s not pretend this is investing though.

Not a short-seller stirring, not even a mouse;  
The heavy bags were hung by the chimney with care,  
In hopes that St. Powell soon would be there;  
The bagholders were nestled all snug in their beds;  
While visions of tendies danced in their heads;  
And Cassandra in her 'kerchief, and Left in his cap,  
Had just settled their puts for a long winter's nap...

We’re in one of the greatest bull markets of our lifetimes. Of course people are going to take excessive levels of risk. Many millionaires/billionaires were borne out of times like the dot com era, financial crisis. Periods of inefficiency in the marketplace are the best times to take outsized risk. His alternative would have been to invest in the S&P 500 at the beginning of the year where he would have seen a decline of 30% by the end of March. That’s about the same amount of downside risk as any of his individual stock plays with much greater upside.

Dude, spy will rebound eventually, an individual dividend stock has much less guarantee to do so then the entire market
Started trading early December last year. Started with $100 and played it safer made turned it to $130 in about a month, was hyped and needed more of them tendies. Put in $1150 more so I had a nice investment of 1250. Thought I was a decent number. Fuck yeah mofucker turned into 5,300 and I was hyped! Bomb Bang! Pow! crash! Robinhood crash! Can’t sell fucking cunts! $400 left... supper autist energy rage of revenged on robinhood for being making me be a cuck and watch my wife’s boyfriend fuck the shit out of me, my portfolio, and her! Then SPY PUTS to the win, up to 9k from $400 and now I’m fucking my wife’s boyfriend and her at the same time bitch! Tendies! So I took out 5k cause well I’m also an adrenaline junkie and I had money so I spent 10k on a motor(should of just sent it in the market because that’s what a true degenerate would of done) then I blew the rest to $4 got marked a pattern day trader. Waiting a while, slapped $80 in there, got a peak of $1300 annnd it’s gone, back down to a little over $80, invested $650 more so now I have $730 my own cash(740ish in my portfolio) cranked that bitch up to $1900 in less than a week anddd today I ended at $680 what a cunt. Don’t worry give me some time I’ll be buying my wife’s boyfriend some dinner and cocaine.
From what I can gather, BarkBox is way more popular than I thought. I think we could easily see at least $50 after the merger

Now that's a DD I can get behind
let's say you lost 30,000. you can write off 3k a year. so this year you can write off 3,000, then next year another 3k. it carries over.

Would there be a squeeze if the short sellers already bought calls to limit their losses.
Thanks bro..... I really wasn't getting it.
Yea that’s true
Right? This asshole is taking $50/yr to invest my shit into what’s essentially mutual funds like I couldn’t do that myself.
So what’s the big idea with oil Corps we ripping or dipping

My grandma gave me $100 for Christmas what should I buy
You don’t even need to do DD. Let these autists do it for you. In terms of long term I haven’t seen one failure yet this year. TSLA, GME, BABA, THC 🐝, PLTR, NIO, as long as you don’t get in too late and you hold long enough shit works out

it means you can deduct 300 dollars of charity donations straight up against your income if you dont itemize your deductions.

itemized deductions means you deduct mortgage, real estate tax, state tax etc..

 normally charitable contributions is deductible only if you itemize your deductions but this year there is a special rule for those who only use standard deduction. people who dont have those expenses as mention above will take standard deduction. its a small incentive to donate and save on taxes.
I've hit Buy to Open when I really meant Sell to Open, so yeah, it happens
Everyone here sucks, boy. The question is do you swallow?
Yeah and I wouldn’t buy them either. The true small arms we can buy aren’t really securing huge defense deals.

I’m banking on it. Putting at least 40-50% of my portfolio in PLTR stocks and options for long term.
First of all, I don’t believe he made all of that the way he says. It’s easy to cherry pick your best days. If I showed you my account on my winning days, WSB would blow me. 

Second, he’s taking massive amounts of single stock risk. It’s called a terrible investment approach and also called getting lucky (the probability was terrible). Only in 2020 does this approach work (it might have also worked in 199). 

The fact that nobody recognizes this is because most of these kids started investing this year. They have no clue what normal investing conditions/returns looks like. 

It’s not going to end well for most. Also, if dumb dick (OP) keeps this up, eventually he will crap out.

Agree with you. How can you not like the data provider behind the major sportsbooks and with sportsbetting eventually getting legalized nationwide in the US, this is a strong sector. Out of curiosity, any other up and comers you feel strong about?

It's losing money, and revenue is declining. Not to mention there's the threat of the shelf offering hanging at this particular point in time.

They need to show a big turnaround to justify any revenue multiple above 1x. Otherwise it's going right back down for the next earnings.

Never fuck with politics vs money situations. Happened to Rockefeller, Bell (AT&T founder), Carnegie, etc. in the US. Happening to Ma right now
I guess it’s different in every state. In Chicago New York and la business owners are being harassed and ticketed by the government for even staying open. In the city I go to college there are dozens of resturaunts who have gone out of business permanently. It’s really sad to see the auctions or the empty buildings that used to have businesses

😂😂😂 look At me we control the sub now
You’re an idiot lmao can you Google that word for me and then read the first example sentence that shows up FUCKING DUMBASS LMAOOOOOOO so now you’ll be broke AND stupid lololol you probably should’ve atleast googled the word before looking like an absolute fool
I'm not from Canada but pretty sure lotta people under the impression it's more "medical" type weed(doesnt get you as high) and the scale they produce it doesn't allow for quality and care. So you end up with mass produced mid (weak) flooding the market while the gas is produced more small scale

Edit: I just googled tilrays products, they produce some quality, I'd say anything over 18% thc is quality they got some all time bangers, blue dream, glue, white widow. I'm sure they all do tho.
Grabbed four 220 calls so I’d swing them on a Green Day why not

I just checked out the code, it’s so retarded, literally states ticker goes up do some calculus; Ticker goes down do some  calculus ; then apply pretty colors and print. 

Jokes aside. 
Add a corn job to run the script to check portfolio pre-market, before noon  then check 20mins before closing since it’s a simple script.
I just logged in and checked. It’s actually up to $7.4k but still pathetic for 10 years of growth. Now that I’m digging deeper, the entire balance is invested into TICBX, which is a Thornburg “investment builder” stock, which unsurprisingly tanked this year in March. My advisor sucks. He didn’t cash out before the tank or double down after the tank, so I effectively lost money. He’s got my entire portfolio invested into an autopilot account that seems to report a small % of gains each year, which I guess keeps most clients happy, but I’m so mad that he wasn’t able to take better advantage of the markets this year. Infuriating. I’m cashing out before the end of the year and managing it myself. Yolo.
Bagholding AMD and ROKU, if they could go up, that would be great.

US Steel goes all the way back to the early 1900s and used to be known simply as "The Corporation" it was so big. It's contributed to the development of every major city and manufacturing economy in North America and was instrumental in winning World Wars.

A few of Musk's companies are interesting and will be a part of our shared future but US Steel got us all to where we are today.

I traded this stock based on technical analysis and a sprinkle of luck. I’m still holding my position and plan to hold for several weeks to months. The fact that it’s still holding above 100 is a very good sign to me. I buy the dips on Tesla and apple but this is a momentum play and I’m just riding the wave!

You have not mentioned anything about the main reason tilray and apha jive together. The European connection. Tilray and apha are leaders in the EU with facilities, licences, distribution (CC Pharma), and contracts. Also, alot of Thier assets complement eachother. 

 The states is definitly the crown jewel of cannabis currently, but I predict that by 2025 Europe will have a drasticly matured medical side. Aphria and tilray have EU GMP certified facilities and first mover advantage. The international play is a long game though. 

  I want to see them get into the states as soon as they are legally able to. The thing with the states though is there is already alot of competition and licences are getting very expensive to acquire.  My hope is that apha/tilray will merge with a major player in the MSO world when they are legally able to so, such as Cresco labs, green thumb industries, or Cura leaf.

Companies have all different ex dividend dates. So yeah you could just make that play probably almost every other day of the year and rake in the dividends.
yeah, so we're saying the same thing as far as the 100 goes. i'm just assuming it's expressed as a whole number percentage.

the S/V part is supposed to represent the fact that you are only paying premiums not share prices, but you're right i definitely fucked up the other side of the equation and just put '1 call ' instead of like '1 shares worth of calls' or whatever would make that not sound retarded lol.

Some people burn incense after they smoke weed to cover up the smell. I just let a little ball of hash sit there burning. My thinking is if incense is good enough for plebs to use it for covering up the smell of weed because it's a stronger smell than weed, that means hash should be great for covering up the smell of weed because hash has an extremely strong scent possibly even moreso than incense.
This is the way

Eh I got stocks not options. Its fine.
I monitor price during market hours the most as you can usually notice when things start moving out of the ordinary, and with ToS it’ll link all the relative news to the position. 

I honestly try to avoid binary events and stocks with potential news lurking which was my mistake trading BABA although I still see it as a solid value play relative to where most stocks are priced.

Even with that said, I’ll avoid any foreign stocks here forward though as it isn’t necessary to trade them for how I play.

I also avoid oversized positions so can usually afford when large moves that aren’t common hit which helps in not necessarily needing the fastest news at all times although it would increase profitability most likely.
averaged down more today. We validated the major uptrend support. I think we should see more buyers stepping in now going into next week and beyond. As long as we keep making higher lows and higher highs, we’ll be good. 🙏

People don't realize that most advisors aren't actually advising and their incentives aren't the same as yours. There goal is to not lose your money so they can continue to charge fees. If the account goes up in value that's great but they are hoping you just continue to add your monthly amount.

Oh i agree.

But innovation in healthcare, at least surgical innovation is almost ALL in the American healthcare system because its actually profitable. 

My thesis is that the last country in the world with a health system that prints money in terms of profiting is nearing its end. Intuitive surgical will have to change the way they design their equipment, and offer way more support to legacy systems to thrive once the music stops.

for example, Intuitive no longer offers GI staple loads for their older surgical robots, a very VERY interval part to some cases, essentially forcing facilities into buying the newer models that cost millions of dollars, just so they can keep doing the procedures that had been doing previously. 

Ive never seen that sort of product discontinuation around any other clip or staple load, or stapler in this job, because if Ethicon says they're not going to make a lap staple anymore, or discontinue support, a facility can turn around and do business with 5 other competitors. Intuitive is a monopoly, and abusing the LIVING fuck out of it that surpasses greed.

Not saying intuitive isnt a good investment, but i wouldnt sleep on any news or data that suggests a surgical slowdown, health insurance decline, or any progress in any legislature towards a single payer system

If they’re still operating then some try-hard on this sub isn’t getting investigated EVER.

Are you still confident in any of these options? I am thinking about going into some of them.

Time for a pump then.  Bears in shambles.
precisely
Holding 250 calls here strike $10 expiration September down 40% but don’t care for plenty time not playing covered calls it’s too cheap to cap my gains waiting for more new good news or a spike on this before I wheel it. letting it ride and I’m gathering more money to accumulate just shares in case this dips to 6.
It's not gay if it's Christmas Eve, bro. Calm down.
Happy holidays guys, down 40% all time but my heart is full knowing that I’m healthy and have family around. Take care of yourselves and your loved ones!
Paperwork. A bunch of places will send you forms, you go to the IRS website to find the programs that prepare your taxes for free, you enter in all the things the forms say, then you try to find 12,000 dollars worth of bullshit to deduct. Mileage from your delivery job, that burrito you had while working, the new computer you bought that is totally for business and not gaming, and... every last cent you lost YOLOing calls in RH. 

If that's more than 12k dollars, you enter all that in and use that as your deduction. If not, 12k is the standard deduction. 

Then the site tells you what you owe. 


If you make real money independently, you need to estimate and pay taxes quarterly. IRS gets bitchy if you need to pay over 1000 in taxes at the end of the year from self employment and trading - they want their cut quarterly. If you make over 40k a year from that, get a tax app and keep track of shit so you can pay. I use Stride and paid 600 bucks to the IRS in July. 

It's like 20% if you make 40k, 30% if you're over. Capital gains rates are different, and if you arent a retard and hold a stock or call for a year you pay less tax.
holy shit you could not be using this data more wrong 

It's 100% outdated
Guys,

I've seen predictions for hot-rolled coil steel to be $900 in Q1 2021.  

2008 it was $1000, and MT was $98 (will show higher other places due to the split in 2017). 

Do with that what you will, covid and country policies (see China price manipulation) can affect this as well. If this is going to be a covid sector rotation, the pump could push it to these levels I feel. 

They are opening a new furnace. I do believe their balance sheet is not great though and they are operating at a loss (although not necessarily indicative of this being a bad short term play)

I might do April or June options on this to capture a hopeful q1 surge. Perhaps even a 2022 leap.

Consider it money spent learning
**[Date of birth of Jesus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date of birth of Jesus)**

The date of birth of Jesus is not stated in the gospels or in any historical reference, but most theologians assume a year of birth between 6 and 4 BC. The historical evidence is too incomplete to allow a definitive dating, but the year is estimated through three different approaches: (A) by analyzing references to known historical events mentioned in the nativity accounts in the Gospels of Luke and Matthew, (B) by working backward from the estimation of the start of the ministry of Jesus, and (C) astrological or astronomical alignments. The day or season has been estimated by various methods, including the description of shepherds watching over their sheep.

I'm in a similar situation. Starting trading options last week and was doing ok with $FEYE calls but selling at like 5% profit because I'm a noob and thinking that was huge. Got hit with the PTD but was doing so well I bought 30 calls near top yesterday hoping for some big gains. Let's just say today was no bueno.

They’re fucked on open for sure and even the next t few months but they’re so state owned that it’s in the entire interest of China to keep them active and alive. I more think this antitrust is a way to showcase how they are adhering to the west standards with “oversight”

Okay doomer 🤡
See this is where my lack of tech knowledge hurts. I assumed if it's in low orbit it can cover the entire area and you can just connect to it from a device.
G M E is only going up because that retard who sold Chewey for 1/20th of it's actual value decided to double down in G M E during the dip.

He's like the rest of us but he has the money to actually catch the falling knife and stop it dead in it's tracks.
This is all bullshit. When governors open up their states the markets will explode. Make no mistake the virus isn’t affecting the economy, it’s the lockdowns. I’m in Florida right now and the malls are packed like sardines. Betting against spy is a lethal mistake.
Some SkyNet shit
Huge props. Congrats man
GME JAN15 '21 20 CALL  
Stock price = 20  
Premium/Price = 3.0  
Δ=0.5

So 1 call = 20/3\*0.5\*100= 333 shares. That can't be true.

The risk for the MM should be Δ\*100=50. And that's only assuming volatility won't change.

Gimme some CELH 🍉 flavor and a night on Cathie’s Ark. my kinda night
I legit just did this last night lol. Here’s a link to my ridiculous 2020 extravaganza in this total mess:

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kjb3id/wallstreetbets_saved_my_life/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
Both.
Yep so I've really started to reconsider things. Exactly like I did in August...then September came! Not making that mistake again
U of Chicago 😂😂😂😂😂😂
Sorry to burst your bubble, but what I'm seeing happening in Canada and now US is nothing but textbook tyrannical socialist autocracy being rolled out slowly and systemically based on the Chinese Maoist cultural revolution communist model, wrapped in the nice looking package of "we care about you and we're doing this for everyone's safety and well-being, just trust us because we have you best interest at heart". North America is basically doomed at this point, your leaders have sold you all out and I give it 50 years tops in the best case scenario, before it becomes nothing but a Chinese proxy.

No politician or any 'system figurehead', as I like to call them (think Bill Gates and co.) is selfless, they're self-serving and system-serving, because that's their role. Most of them pricks and psychopaths, a few of them with a smidge of moral compass, but as a whole, they're there to ensure the "plebs" are in line, one way or another.

I'm speaking this from a perspective of a dude that was born during a communist regime fallout. I was a baby, so I'd lie if I said I remember anything from firsthand experience other than some fuzzy memories about running from the warzones, but I'm a direct descendant of 2 families that got killed, tortured and oppressed by the marxist ideology, systemically, for decades.

And if you think I'm some right wing nutcase, guess again. I hate fascism at least as equally, because that shit DIRECTLY CAUSED those 50 years of murderous communism in my homeland, on top of a mass genocide of Jews and other 'undesirables', sale of my region to Italy and overall psychotic ideology that was the catalyst for WW2.

I'm a member of a minuscule minority of population who has a drop of sane thought left in their brains in my country. A lot of my peers are radicalized, by left and right wing toxic ideologies. It's psychotic at times. I can't have 2 of my best friends in the same room because they fucking hate each other, because of some fuckwad ideologies from 1945.

I see this same shit being rolled out in North America, right now, under your very noses. Yet you don't see it, because they've perfected their methods and their craft, insidious and elegant, yet evil as fuck at its core. I'm not picking sides or saying one is more righteous than the other. Both sides are blind and being led like pigs to slaughter.

Divide et impera. Being done right in the open, yet everybody cheers it as if hating your neighbor is gonna fix your life's problems.

Good luck and, if you've got the rest of your life ahead of you, start thinking about your exit strategy, moving to another country, before it's too late for any of us maybe...

If history teaches us one thing, it's that we humans are prone to give in to fanaticism and radicalism of all kinds and sorts, and end up killing each other en masse every couple decades, without fail, so better be as ready as you can rather than caught with your pants down.
Ill give you an armpit job for the price of 1 pltr share

This is not a good plan. Gamestop would have to be able to reliably turn around aging hardware tech which is not the same thing as used games. Used games, are good until the next console cycle, there is no difference in the new and used game. However what you are describing is a different market, buying outdated tech in the hopes you can resell all of it. You are talking about holding a lot of stock and more importantly the person buying it needs to know what fair value is for each device. This also leave open holes as items go up for sale on huge discounts and people can possibly resell on to Gamestop for profit. Flood Gamestop with a drone that they didn't realize was going obsolete.

Moreover phones are not really part of this opportunity, so you are talking more niche products like drones. Why not phones? Because most phones are on plans and those plans involve turning the phone back over in order to receive the discount on the next upgrade. Even if they were, ask yourself if after the GeekSquad searching laptops fiasco at BestBuy if you really want to turn your phones over to Gamestop employees.

The local delivery angle is a way they can shine, but in your calculations you don't seem to be paying him. In a couple of years it will be 15$ an hour in most major cities cutting hard into the 50$ profit of the delivery itself, you need to make sure you are reselling a drone or gadget every 3 hours.

Play the short squeeze, stop trying to pretend GameStop as a company has a way forward with these terrible ideas. Gamestop has never been in the fair price business, hardware is an even more volatile market, they are going to offer worse prices comparatively in order to not take huge losses.
No but maybe you'd get a better ROI for all that care and attention you're investing

I'm curious to know what news services do you use to be on top of information that could affect your position? Specifically do you use any sort of service that uncovers pertinent news as fast as possible?
You are right but it was very small amount
I make  plenty of money will post my positions tommorow, I have 2,7 mil in investments
This is fucking stupid
Great points!  There’s a flip side to nearly every investment thesis.

In my view, the market has been calling for Intuitive Surgical’s demise for decades. Whereas some say healthcare is too expensive and can’t continue to pay for expensive tools like Da Vinci — I’d argue that healthcare net-net can be cheaper and better with advanced AI, robotics, and automation.  You can’t stop innovation — and the market will demand the best technologies.  

Best of luck and thanks for sharing your perspectives! Have a great day.

Hey my family is from there!  I'm in philly, single party city for over a century with 2/478 GOP members in city counsel.

This sub is going downhill.. no one understands the dialect of the autists no longer. 

But I remember.. I remember.
My shitfolio is very short this holiday weekend too
There's no way no property taxes would fly.

Every locality is practically forced to enforce them. With no actual way for the feds to stop it.

The gst will destroy everyone who lives on a fixed income.

Ie largest % of the nation.

Because yes a typically thought of "middle class income". At 50k non-gross. 

Is "fixed" after one financially endebetures themselves.

Then refinances those credit cards + student loans. Into a fixed and managed debt repayment plan.

If **all** property taxes became **enforceably** illegal. 

And, you had the IRS and Treasury sending the Secret Service. 

After every municipal politburo. Who got cute on Uncle Sam. 

Trying to pass property taxes through any means. To double-dip+. 

Then maybe that could be viable. 

As, i've never seen a way to enforce the GST. 

Even if we passed a Constitutional Ammendment. 

To block the States capabilities to just write their own,

- "F you rest of the USA Ammendments"

- Ie "We enjoy no tariffs, or other remittances."

- Ie "We wave away federal protections. By State constitutional amendment." 

- Then, we'll, "Bad State". Tax residents a property tax. 

At least *one* State will get it through. 

Matter of marketing, ignorance (time), and greed. 

20-25 yrs of passable observance. Then, wel have a double or triple tax. 

Regressively based, and practical every locality will be jumping for it. 

"Free money" that would sure be nice to monopolise. When everyone else does it too.

No *way to fail* and that's a **failure**.

That's why GST is untenable. 

It doesn't fit within our foundational structure.

Its inversely engineered. 

- Blocks our controls on abuse. Otherwise inbuilt. 

- Ie malfeasance. 

Instead of, 

- Controls on malfeasance. 

- By increasing capital flow. 

- Ie direct disbursements, paid out "guaranteed". 

- A step removed. From SINGLE wrongdoing localities.

Stoping a trending towards fiefdom. Eliminating total monopolies.

Ie property taxes,

- Raised to fix their own failures. 

Instead of fixing what they can by *themselves*. 

Then, 

- Reaching out for the rest of the nation to build them up further. 

- Ie grants, etc. 

If something is truly out of reach. Their need remains, so OUR issue remains. 

It will **be met** so long as the nation can meet it. 

The GST would take away that leg up. From as needed grants, federally. 

Losing tariffs, and a de-conglomerated financial pipeline. From top-down. 

We could increase cashflow accross board. 

Ie,

- Post-residents gaining a small regular cashflow. 

This *guaranteed flow*. 

Keeps large debt payments. From draining stagnant incomes. 

    Residents money -> elsewhere
    
    Per resident,
    
    resourcesNewToTax < resourcesOldToTax
    
    propertyTaxes++ while taxableResources--

This,

In a locality that sees no realistic appreciation. 

- Ie most of our nation's small towns. 

Then, 

Death spirals occur. In population, investiture, and appreciation.

A cashflow through a guaranteed income. Even small, buys us time.

Allowing *on* 'spiral' **start**. 

Congress ```time++``` to react. With our existing procedures for assistance.

Keeping the "death" out of the equation.
It goes without saying, this is the way.
We all got raped bro

Tell me what the 🍉 is or else
Im doing my part
didn't even mention your wife's boyfriend once in this whole article... I can't take you seriously...
Well I obviously started in things I thought would grow in the future/tech , Tesla, amd, nvidia. But the real break came when I heard about DraftKings going public through a SPAC merger. Had no idea what that even was but it allowed me to start making bigger bets and It was the company that got me into options, which obviously are the biggest part of my gains. I had known about DraftKings for years and thought it was an absolute beast of a company. Full ATM machine/ print money at will. Anyway when I hit big on those options I learned more about spac companies and took all my gains and just kept going deep in a couple of them and play the same way I did DraftKings. ( got in early. Picked some catalyst dates and picked a spread of options with varying risk)My latest and biggest gainer is Gme though... I got in June and July at 4$ and just loved all the catalysts that would come for them in the fall with console cycle. Nothing I’ve put money in has come from wsb. It’s definitely important to do your own research/ have a plan/ and believe in what you’re investing in. It’s helped me hold through tough times.
So is theta decay on holiday too? /s

Edit: 🍉
I sold on green never went on a big loss, but why does it show that i still have my money?
I dont believe 1% of the people on here could code in python or even know what python is.

Too bad SPACs are free money. WSB missed out.

I've seen no evidence of him selling
I will include the mods in the interview with the SEC, any illegal activity needs to be brought down
Correct, I would’ve personally closed the position most likely at a 2-3x loss which would’ve been sub 1k. 

I’m watching all my positions constantly throughout the day. My main reason for closing rather than adjusting is due to my unfamiliarity with what the impact will be with China and I was already initially concerned as I don’t play china’s stocks so I’d like to think I would’ve shut it down immediately or once it hit the 2-3x mark which is my mental stop. 

It’s after hours collapses that make things much more difficult for naked options as hedging with shares is pretty much your only solution.
monopoly, is that news? or was it not obvious?
Minneapolis checking in. We have 2 seasons: winter and construction...the latter always fails to make things any better haha

I bet your husband’s girlfriend is be proud of you
Unknown. But usually when they leak details like this it is a good sign it will follow thru. If it does happen, it will happen in the first few months of 2021 as SPACs are required to return the $ and dissolve if they don't acquire a company within a certain amount of time. The gamble is, by the time they announce a definitive deal in place the price will instantly launch up into the 40s. A tried and true YOLO! Lol.

Yea I made a list but she buys and sells all the time so she’s constantly adjusting I would just hold long term not sure if it would work out in my favor
This is what I heard, reading your post: blah,blah,blah, blah, fake story, blah, blah, blah, no proof, blah,blah, blah, basement bitch
The fact is that SIR\_JACK\_A\_LOT is a swing trader. Yes he pumps his stocks and closes relatively quickly but he doesn't pump shit stocks. If you bought any of his positions when he posted you'd be up on everything. A pump and dump requires the dump part where investors are left holding a stock that is worth less than when they bought it. He did, however, break wsb's rule #4; STIC's market cap is below $1B.

His positions closed and what they're worth currently

* NCLH: Exit at 17.95. Current share price is 24.51
* CHWY: Exit at 44.35. Current share price is 104.10
* NCLH (again): Exit at 19.16. Current share price is 24.51
* CRSR: Exit at 35.57. Current share price is 36.70
* PTON: Exit at 109.46. Current share price is 163.60
* GME: Exit at 15.96. Current share price is 20.26

*\*Exits are estimations from his posts*

STIC: Posted DD when share price was around 14.25. Current share price is 17.85

Saying no is the #1 skill of a successful trader and Cramer says yes to way too many things.  He generates liquidity, that's his job.  He DOES NOT help people.  Why the fuck would he?  Just because he appeals to the ego of retail doesn't mean he respects them.  After all, he's been rewarded for it for years.
[removed]
If it bothers him that much maybe he should just log off twitter. He's a grown ass man fuck him. It's words on a screen at the end of the day.

I’m not a fan of the blanket removal of comments pertaining to the ex mod. I know that’s how automod works but it’s not really stirring up subreddit drama to let people discuss it imo. 

If people want to discuss it I think it should be their choice. The mod drama is really not that deep for 99% of people here. Just makes people trust the mod team less when relatively harmless comments are removed imo.

Based on the fact that Starboard told cerner to meet the second and last adjusted operating margin goals. It’s like telling Matt Prater to kick a field goal from 17 yards with no opponents

He got that flair for asking what options are so what do you bring to the table to counterbalance him?
If you’re screens cracked the right way you’ll realize it says 50 something % gain
I don’t really think so at least in this pandemic. A lot of people has been jumping to the “investing” wagon after the meteoric rise of the stock markrt. 40k could have been a significant chunk of his bank account which could be a lot for him if he managed to lose it all. 40k is actually not that much in the grand scheme of things, they might just have this “Value” somewhere else like properties for rent. 

If people here is patient enough to do index investing e.g. dropping 10k per year on index, you can achive 40k in merely 4 years which is pretty much doable and decent for average american.

Let's say you don't give a shit, which you don't appear to -- can you understand that other people, such as the Norwegian Investment fund, are divesting their funds from your investments?

Can you process why -- since you don't give a shit about others -- this is financially suicidal for you?

TSLA and AAPL
Thanks for the info. I don't play short squeezes as part of my investment / gambling strategy, so I've had to learn new things. Shorts mostly lose the battle with TSLA to the tune of 28 billion, so anything is possible. But infinity squeeze? Unlikely. I do believe Cohen brings something to the table, and I'm willing to throw a few dollars into a potential CHWY type success story. 

Yes - we are peons to them. Gnats. As long as I can make a few bucks, I'm cool.

Happy holidays friend.
I sold my baba last week after seeing how it was costing me money since I got it. Then bought PLTR🚀

positions?
Imagine not being in the true 🍉 stock CELH.  SMH
I've found the best bang for your buck is cheapo companies, under $20, or at least under $30 but I've had some of my best gains at companies under $10. Buy 100 shares, it sees a 10-20% gain. Eyeball it for a few hours, if it goes no where, exit. Not bad for a few days turn around. If it dips and you faith in the company, you double down with your gains. If it continues to rise slowly, consider waiting for a flatline and buy back in - sit and wait. Only sell at a gain though unless you legit think the company is going to go under. Spread this out among enough tickers and you find your self steady upping.

Wait so Cathie bae is still holding onto BABA in ark right, she hasn't let go of any shares?
I hope he comes back too man 😞
Not making this shit up lol I have 3x your trades and it happens. Get off me retard
If I want a $65k position in TSLA, and I buy shares alone, I'd have 100 and therefore a 100 delta. But I want more risk and reward, so I sell 40 of those shares and buy a Sept $420c that has a 86 delta. Now I have 60 shares and the leaps for a total delta of 146. 1.46 times what I'd have with shares alone. Plus I can sell an occasional FD (guess I could have with 100 shares too, but I don't like all my long assets tied up in case things go wrong).

TSLA is a bit more difficult because it's expensive. Right now I'm leveraged on MSFT about 4x the delta if have with shares alone. $25k position could buy about 113 shares, or a 113 delta. I think I have June leaps right now that total up to about a 500 delta. IV has been low, so I leveraged up just in time.

no, a short squeeze is a different phenomenon.  it goes like this:

stock price goes up --> short sellers get margin calls --> short sellers have to buy their shares back --> this increases demand --> stock price goes up --> feedback loop
this is the perfect show to be making these meme videos on
I'm jewish
Up 258% on 84k initial investment. This was done without EV, without Tech and without any meme stocks. Mostly through large share positions in airlines and hospitality, as well as some well timed slightly OTM 3 month out SPX options.
I had a day 1 Xbox one. It was struggling to run most newer single player games. I intend to get 6 years out of this new one as well. If you look at it from a price paid per hour of use stand point saving a couple hundred doesn’t really matter to me

It worked for me
Shares? You will definitely break even. Whether it's in a few months or a few years depends on Chinese politics. But the company's sales are astounding
Ya, i figured that was the case.  I also joined a class action lawsuit because the reason i lost it all and went negative was that B.S. where the app crashed and we couldnt sell for multiple days due to the covid crash.  So about a month after i filed that my balance dissappeared.  Idk if that helped.
Those weren't cheap...
They’ll only lend your shares out if you use margin, and you’ll know if your shares get lent out because they pay you for them.

$PLUG is a really solid play, great company with solid fundamentals in a high growth space, but its more of a r/stocks or r/investing move at this point.  

If you're looking for calls, go long.  Shares are a solid alternative.  About 2 months ago, you could buy $PLUG $30 Jan 2022 calls for around $650, IV somewhere near 50%.  Now IV will eat you alive.  But you'll learn and grow along the way, and isn't that what life is really about?
Psh buy calls on the ETF's like grownups

Baby it’s cold outside. Lemme see them 🍉 to warm me up
thanks! it crashed in a fiery heap of BABA today, portfolio down about $29k. law of averages catchup perhaps.

to be honest, i'm a wreck from a program/disciplined pov. don't regularly visit wsb unless i'm itching for laughs or just want to zone out. too many extremes here and it will drive a fomo that's generally unhealthy. (says the guy that posted a nice win streak!)

i got sucked into about $700k in margin when i overextended myself and was assigned a shit ton of AMD stock trying to revenge trade (missed it on the way up, then got left holding a shit ton of stock during that sept sell off). sad consequence, i've gotten okay with margin.

position size, whatever buying power i have, anywhere from 2-10 contracts at a time. one annotation i'd make to the chart, i put in $20k about a week ago to satisfy a margin call when i went short about 800 shares of IWM. i generally try to manage cash flow because i want to have flexibility to enter new trades.

2021 goals, carve accounts out a little better. this is the mixed trading account with a mix of stocks and options and not much discipline in terms of what's going to be a short or lt investment. might be a sign of the times, but it is what it is.

i don't trade ft, but been thinking of it... at the same time, i miss the office bc i wouldn't be in front of a screen all the time. and it's kind of sad, i added a second screen to track stocks while i was working, then finally a third screen. can post a picture of the setup if you're interested.

don't want to fall into the trap that i've become good at this. since the election, markets have been on full on rally mode.

I'm using schwab and started doing vertical credit put spreads to generate some cash. Doing a 50 wide spread on SPX usually has a max loss of about 5k - but shouldn't schwab be requiring me to be able to cover the cost of the short position, about 367k? It's been letting me do the trades (70k account about 40k margin available) just wondering why it's letting it happen and don't want to tell schwab.

Sir Jack a lot posted about s t I c, a spac that's merging with Bark Box, he ran the DD like anyone else would his reasoning was sound that bitches love their dogs and they will 100% be into bark box. After he posted about it, it went up like 0.4%... the next morning CNBC I think it was featured Bark Box in a news segment before market open. It pumped to 28% at open, some retards in the sub FOMO'd into it at its height and of course early investors started taking profits. By the end of the day it was only up 24% so they cried foul that they are down 4%. They're also claiming that he sold at the height and took profits, but I haven't seen evidence of that.

Everybody is talking here about a short squeeze. But isn't it just the fact that a lot of people are buying shares and options?

But the classic definition of a short squeeze on WSB is:

\- I buy 1 call option --> MM buys 100 shares --> Prices stock go up

Market makers will delta hedge their positions but will not 100% hedge their positions. If the prices are increasing fast the market makers will buy more shares and the hot run will continue.

And, if a stock is breaking its downtrend a lot of traders will buy stock and this has no direct relationship with people buying call options.

Are you still allowed to say fuck in here?
My price target for $BABA is $0. I calculated this by taking the current price $221.95 and subtracting its entire value.
Inverse
First you add your realized gains then you subtract your realized losses.   If you have a net realized gain you include it is income.  If you have a net realized loss you can count up to $3000 against that year's ordinary income with any leftover losses being applied against gains in future years.  Initial amount doesn't matter it's just realized gains minus realized losses with the loss limitation stated above.

In the example above you gained $3000 and lost $3000 so you have a net realized gain of $0.

Started WSB in Feb with 4k, bought into the SPCE meme 3x and yolo’d in spy puts suddenly at 58k


Yolo’d more into 3 dte spy put and RH is fucking down for a day and a half while spy has a dead cat bounce. got out at 20k.


Felt depressed as AF that week and bought more spy puts and got back to 55k


withdrew 20k to lock in gains


Separate variation and WSB told me to diamond hands spy 200p back to 12k and then i had to cut my losses


Failed a couple of earnings plays (PRPL) down to 4k


bought in NIO PLTR GME and Steel meme back at 30k

After I got these gains, I’m the one that made him. Not the other way around 💯🔥
Kinda early to know. I’ll end up holding some amount forever, after taking gains, I think, this is a good one.
I told y’all to buy the TDOC dip and I was so right...

Guess who didn’t buy the dip...
GLOOOORIAAAAAAAA 🍉🍉🍉🍑🍑🍑🍑
Got off work, bought some nice booze, about to eat dinner with the fam and gf
$2200, smh
I don't disagree, they'll finnagle their way out of this and they will probably laugh their way to the bank by the end.

this whole "haha Melvin losing money" is just wishful thinking. They wouldn't be managing such large positions if they were just a bunch of fucking monkeys pulling levers at random.

But I don't even care about them being in green or in red, they can finesse their way out of a deep negative position and keep all their money, I don't give a fuck, as long as this thing slowly rides up to $30 and beyond next year, where it should be. Looks like we'll have a mini-TSLA at hands, and I'm glad I picked just the right time to get in before the take-off.

Shut up Mr ass man.  Im just joking
Anyone know where I could get an archive of ARK holdings over time?
Look at all the fucking small street gains posted since the best mod left. I mean my portfolio is tiny too, but I know not to post that shit
Yeah I got $400K in TTD in the form of shares and LEAPS. 

Got in for a $15K position in shares and calls for MGNI two weeks ago (along with CRTO and RAMP, which did not pan out as nicely). This run-up has been fun, but it's been going too quick for my liking.
I doubled down before market closed so I really hope your right
Probably talking about those retards at r/investing
I just woke up from a drunken eggnog state of reality. Is it early Monday morning yet and is BABA at $600 premarket?
Did he also make you bang a mandingo in the room while he sat in the corner naked from the waist down, masturbating on a chaise lounge as he watched?

You also friend. I hope that our collective retardation leads to maximum tendies wellness for all.  God bless us, every one!

Depends on your local jurisdiction you’d have to ask someone local. Most jurisdictions allow losses to carry forward.
GoEV is a better play btw
So what would you recommend? Like I said, I don't have the patience or brains to do DD on potential runners.
[removed]
He posted a DD on a company, in no way did he even suggest that anyone pump it. We just gonna ban DD's now out of fear someone might report it to the SEC? GameStop when it was first posted on WSB broke the subs rules because it's marketcap was too small, but everyone ignored it then. This sub is dying.
I like it!!!
Wow so any mention of a certain mod now gets removed for "stirring up subreddit drama????" I'm the one causing drama just for paying respects??? Smh

IN A MANGER 🍉 WAS BORN BY A VIRGIN 🍑!!!!
Market opened sub <230

Only move prior to the option market being available was that I could’ve shorted 200 shares pre-market but I wasn’t in the mood to allocate 46k into a stock short and risk whiplashed although it would’ve worked well in this scenario. 

I closed mid 220s. I was up 2k on the week from theta so I decided to take the 3k loss and rid the headache rather than complicating the position further.

I still believe it’ll probably bounce although when a naked put is breached 5x+ I have to cut it in case I’m wrong especially if the loss is within my bounds.

I also didn’t like the availability to roll down in case the market continued to slide.
Ya its a fucking shame. I thought I was missing the joke after seeing 3k upvotes. Hate to see it.
Good market price, picked it up right after the dip.
That’s fucking stupid
Modfucks please. Please just give us a weekend thread
Ah praise be. BLESSED DAY Offred.

Dabbled with 500 bucks September of 2019. But didn’t really get started till this January after I lost out on a offer for a house( I had been looking for a while). I travel alot for work so my next shot wouldn’t really be until may, and I was sick of my savings sitting in a bank losing value. So I kept adding to my trading acct with the thought of not putting in more than half my life savings (70k) Everything was great and was probably up 50%  then March happened. I lost all my gains and half of my actual deposits in a few days. That’s when I ended up YOLO and added the rest of my savings. Now I’m up 1.4million+ and regularly have 6 figure swing days. Also been down 350k in a couple days. It’s been a wild ride. And I’ve definitely gotten lucky and learned a lot. I can’t believe people can make this type of money pushing buttons on their cracked iPhones.

GME and set limit sales. 🚀🚀🚀
No but yes
Not really a pump and dump if all of the positions he closed is higher than when he left it.

For y'all being lazy haters:

His positions closed and what they're worth currently:

* NCLH: Exit at 17.95. Current share price is 24.51
* CHWY: Exit at 44.35. Current share price is 104.10
* NCLH (again): Exit at 19.16. Current share price is 24.51
* CRSR: Exit at 35.57. Current share price is 36.70
* PTON: Exit at 109.46. Current share price is 163.60
* GME: Exit at 15.96. Current share price is 20.26

*\*Exits are estimations from his posts*

Bears- I hope you enjoy your coal. 

Bulls- let's get some more tendies
u/ahminus revealed to me a scary thing today. It's that, once those short sellers sell and thus create new long positions, those long positions can then be lended to other short sellers, who then sell to create new long positions. Ad infinitum.

I assumed something like that would be illegal, because that's just plain fucking beyond ridiculous. But no, we just live in an illusion of law & order & civility, and it didn't even surprise me that much tbh. Those in charge set the rules and are both the referees and players in a game called 'money, power, influence, control', which they play against us, the perma-losing team.

So yeah, this whole MOASS to infinity theory - it's not impossible for something like that to happen, but it's super unlikely. The rules are rigged against us, we can only benefit as much as they let us benefit. But at least they still let us observe the windows of opportunity. Who knows if that will be possible any more with all this Great Reset globalist shenanigans...
I started trading back in 2012. Save up money from a part time job and invested it in apple. Basically invested about $20k into it over a few years. However, it was also my emergency fund and I’d periodically take money out to pay for shit. Fast forward to this year I have about 35k. March happens I sold my positions and was left with ~30k. Started reinvesting in some stocks I liked when a friend put me onto WSB. Saw the crazy gains and went spy calls for ez money. Doubled my 29k to 58k. Then June happened and my spy calls got fucked. Lost 18k. Pulled my money out and stopped trading for like a month or two. I was still up but I was also pretty devastated. Realized it’s not easy money and I needed to be smarter. I eventually bought back into just stocks and started buying leaps. Sitting at 75k right now. I don’t have the crazy gains that you see here but I also don’t have the crazy losses either. Trading is hard and even when you’re right you won’t necessarily make money. Personally don’t chase the crazy gains because for every retard becoming a millionaire there’s tons of others losing their shirt. Good luck and Merry Christmas.

When GME was first being posted about it also technically broke the subs rules for having too small of a marketcap, but these retards want to ignore that inconvenient fact as well.
If you’re buying itm leaps, might as well be buying shares at that point.

Um.. why pretend that you’re a woman though.. that’s equally as sad as the sims thing
BABA? How is it in the Asian market
ive more than doubled my account in 3 months. just dont fight trends, buy leaps in good long term companies, and put all the profits from those in spacs, buy stuff on dips and be patient, like how i bought aapl when it dipped, msft when it dipped, though you have to be patient your calls can go half but dont panic, now im in GM and WMT and T for calls, the second they give me profit ill sell em, put profits in spacs and repeat process. if you wanna gamble short term stuff why hang yourself in short term options, spacs give just as good returns if you get in early and wait.
Be well friend.

Roll or sell ASAP.

Unless it squeezes you're probably not getting past your break even in 4 fucking trading days. Every single day you can see the shorts fighting back and paper handers cashing out. 

If you can grab something out in March or April you'll be much better positioned.
Were you not keeping track of news on BABA that could potentially wreck your trade? If you were alerted early enough of the CCP antitrust investigation, could you not have exited with less damage?
Hey asshole I have first rights to a permaban!

Make 50k in realized gains - lose 50k in gains 50k -3k 47K to be taxed
PLTR or APPL
I know. Fuck gradual increases.
Judging by your buying power you are ahead of most people here
Not unpopular necessarily just....kinda off for some reason
Your mom has 1B page views anally.
This is my real name too
I believe you can offset the losses. For example, if you lost $30,000 in 2020 then in 2021, you could potentially deduct $3,000 from income. If you also made $10,000 in gains in 2021, then you wouldn’t have to pay taxes on the $10,000 because you still have the carryover losses. This assumes the loss / gain are of same type ( short or long ). You can still deduct the $3,000 because you still have $20,000 in losses. In 2022, you’d have $17,000 of carried over losses. If In 2022, if you gained $20,000 then you’d have to pay taxes only on $3000.

TLDR : Not a tax professional but if you have losses, you should be able to offset them with gains in following years.
Yeeaaa
There is a push to switch to a strong e-commerce focus. This will allow them to leverage their current brick and mortar locations for fulfillment purposes. Taking a bigger stake in eSports will give the stores more opportunity to bring people in and drive additional revenues.

You are betting against people with deep pockets.

They will easily come out of this on the other side.
Very fake and gay
Y’all ever have one of those moments during premarket where you realize you’re way too over leveraged in a meme stock like GME and you realize how much of an idiot you are and tell yourself you’re only gonna buy shares of blue chips from now on and high dividend stocks and then the market opens and you’re down 69% and you see something like BLNK mooning so you FOMO the rest of your buying power in to it and buy the exact top and basically lose it all 1 hour later ?
So they should improve their diet and also not take the vaccine?

I utilize probability of OTM off ToS for rough estimates. 

Probability of profit would’ve been slightly higher as I had a lower B/E than $225.
You should know the drill by now.  Positions or ban.
Does this deduction only count for the initial amount invested? For example if I initially invest 100 and my account hits 3100 by trading options, then I end up losing the 3000 gain in the same fiscal year, can I still claim the 3000 loss?

2) MU 7/20 90 calls in 2018 They were pennies at the time and MU was trading in the 50’s with a PE of 6 or something insane like that. Expectations were so high for earnings, which beat, but still traded sideways 

3) msft- we all know what happened in March
Thank you for your diligence
Seriously my friends.  Never ever buy options.  Its a losing battle.   The ridiculous gains posted here are 1/10000.   Just do the math at 1.7M subscribers.     Theta is a bitch and Gamma is queen of bitches.   Always be other side of your autistic trade.   Only time you want to Buy calls or puts is when you are Buying leaps ATM or ITM.     The odds are heavily stacked against you when Buying options.  Not only you have to guess timing but also direction.

It's for the kids! Not our declining revenue!
Started in March with about 500. Turned that into 2500 with pennies and used that as a down payment on a house in July then stopped trading for a few months cause I was broke af. Then when TSLA split I dropped 900 in again and bought 2 shares and im at roughly 2600 again.
I lost hundred on PLTR and quit that shit. Merry Christmas!

I feel like I’m chasing at these levels.

ELON SAYS STARLINK TO LIST THROUGH SPAC PSTH

I want to watch her documentary again, but if my wife wakes up and sees it, she’s gonna judge me hard.
What is tax stress?
Shit. I corrected one of the formulas, but not all of them... after the first 50.98% gain, it was adding 59.8%...

After correcting all of it, it would still be over $100,000,000... still not bad.
Did you buy calls or shares. Because the RSI is high so I wouldn’t be surprised to see a pullback but it’ll rebound. So if you have shares you’ll be good
Definitely the year to yolo. That  pump over the summer was insane
Fair enough.
Just did ah yeah
IDA
I started trading (as an on-the-side thing, I’ve always had a full-time job) in 2016. I probably was pretty much flat from 2016 to this year. I tried a bunch of different things and strategies, etc. and I’d go up a bunch then down a bunch and over three years probably was just even.

I started making a lot more in salary though and this year really put a lot in my brokerage and found that the secret to making money in the market is having money. This year I’ve done really well and it’s because I have set goals, abide by them, and if something goes sideways, I don’t stress because no one trade makes up too much of my account.

Three years ago because I had less, I would dedicate too much to just a few trades and if the market turned I was stuck. I didn’t want to sell at huge losses but I also then didn’t have any money to trade with because it was tied up in those losing trades. That led to a lot of stress and emotional (and therefore bad) decisions.

Now if something goes against me, I can just let it sit until it recovers and go about my business. I can stay calm and make rational decisions instead of desperate decisions, and that (plus a crazy bull market...) has made all the difference.

*There's always risk.*

This is a different angle than just waiting for your purchase to shit the bed.

You can always redistribute into longer calls or spread them over varying values that are riskier vs less risky.  Like expecting PLTR to be $60 in 2 years is a lot less risky than PLTR hitting $60 in 2 months.

Still all in for PLTR but at least you can have a McRib to go w/ that bowl of Shin Ramen.
I work in this industry; and ive worked with the DaVinci SI/XI machines in the OR.

They're cool, but I think the importance is a bit overblown. Surgeons will blow it up and blow smoke up its ass because it makes them more money, and they can sit down instead of stand for 8 hours a day doing surgery. But it offers no time saving, and the dissections are meh. Theres a big divide in the surgical world ive noticed, people who think robotic surgery is the shit, the other half who think its a joke to scam people. 

I think as healthcare trends to be less profitable (fewer people with insurance/push towards national healthcare), they'll see a decline since they cost alot more to maintain.

Don’t say marry Christmas in China or that’ll put you in jail
It does work well, I look for a few other factors too. Because of my job I have to hold positions for 30 days, so it’s kind of difficult. I’ll look for bullish flag patterns, high short interest, and maybe insider buying.
I could get behind that. Assuming the price point for retail broadband is under $50/mo
I'm excited to see this. I bought 2 GME $18.5@1-21-21 a few weeks ago. This is me figuring out how this shot works.  Next year my resolution is to make some life changing money.

No one can answer that question but you man. I’m about 20/80 ETFs/stocks but like I said I prefer to hunt for my conviction buys. I think for most people it would be at least 50/50. If you want to play it safe inverse me and do 80/20 haha

Wife on period.  She says no.
First off, you’re doing something terribly wrong if you’re down 65% YTD in this market. I first dabbled in stocks a couple years ago and made modest gains at the beginning investing in companies with strong leadership and disruptive technology/ideas. After a few months started doing calls and if you’re smart about it and play catalysts right, it’s an easy way for 100%+ returns. Momentum on a stock is just about everything now so don’t be investing in boomer dividend stocks

25 next week, already confirmed by a TA analyst a few hours ago.
How old are you? If you're in your 20s, I get it, this stuff really kills your belief in the better future and cracks big holes in those rose-tinted glasses I remember wearing myself at some point too.

I'm not gonna lie, I hate this shit too, but it's always been like that, it's just that nowadays it's basically impossible to hide it with the proliferation of free information. And the boys in charge stopped caring, they just keep doing it because they never suffer any true consequences. Faces change, game keeps on being played with the same rigged rules.

There's no best solution for it. First step is accepting that it's a reality. Then you decide what to do about it. 

I've chosen to take a path that sees me benefiting as much as possible from this shit, as much as I can. I'm still at the very beginning, just recently started doing stock market shit, because before that, I was stuck in the rat race and had zero money to leverage up with all this manipulated shit.

But, I'm not a selfish asshole, I like helping ppl when I can. I chucked $30 at a homeless dude yesterday, he needed it more than me, because he was rummaging through the dumpster behind my building, searching for something valuable to get him through the winter months... I'd give him more, but I'm not rich yet, so I gave him as much as I could spare.

If I ever get rich as fuck, I'm definitely doing philanthropy, but I already know I cannot help them all. I can maybe help 100 people, maybe 1000, maybe 10,000, but there's always a limit. The system is designed to favor ruthless and cuthroat approach.

You either fuck bigly, or get fucked bigly. No in between.
We're all just NPCs in your MMORPG, man.
I'm not big on couches that are designed in such a way that I could not have my feet on the ground and also my back against the backrest

How are my fellow autists celebrating Christmas this year?
I knew it was gonna hit when I bought them at 1.15 when the share price was 73 last Friday. I was expecting 95 this week and 115 next. I was planning on holding near expiry and it’s out performing my expectations. When the stars align you don’t go looking for meteor showers.

MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS.  LETS GET WEIRD IN HERE TONIGHT
I thought it would this week with the stimulus failure. Nope somehow that was priced in
Coulda woulda shoulda. I could literally write a book with all my stories of what could have been. I try to delete them from my brain and move on.
na i’m first
I saw that, I didn’t think one mod leaving a huge sub like this would have such a great impact. Maybe the mods are taking time off or something for holiday, understandably.
Merry Christmas internet friends. I got my ten month old son a build a bear Grogu, a share of aapl, nke, and sbux in his custodial brokerage account.

I’m holding 8 shares of NKLA just so I’m constantly reminded for lols.
They didn’t ‘pay’ out someone’s debt, they just didn’t recover what they fronted likely because they would be slapped down for lending someone money who shouldn’t be lent money skipping due diligence. Robinhood isn’t going to send the IRS money on your behalf, lol.
**[List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the president of the United States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List of people pardoned or granted clemency by the president of the United States)**

This is a partial list of people pardoned or granted clemency by the President of the United States. The plenary power to grant a pardon or a reprieve is granted to the president by Article II, Section 2, Clause 1 of the Constitution; the only limits mentioned in the Constitution are that pardons are limited to federal offenses, and that they cannot affect an impeachment process: "The president shall ... have power to grant reprieves and pardons for offenses against the United States, except in cases of impeachment".Though pardons have been challenged in the courts, and the power to grant them challenged by Congress, the Court has consistently declined to put limits on the president's discretion. The president can issue a full pardon, reversing a criminal conviction (along with its legal effects) as if it never happened.

Someone make the vaccine into a juul pod, that’ll convince the people to take it
That’s a risk of lose 10k, expectation is def smaller than 600 when I opened it.
Totally agree, and the nuance behind this gets lost by a degree in each forum; the figures right now matter a lot less than the signaling of PLTR being implemented into more environments that are traditionally difficult to get into due to red-tape, incumbents and bureaucracy. 

I see these contracts as more precursors for how they will snowball into larger B2B moves. The 17 year run up is also deliberately ignoring IoT adoption, which has exponentially grown over the last 4 years. I think for short term traders there is way too much information and DD to parse to deduct value atm, so they focus on the numbers.  

Tl;dr - the numbers do not mean a lot, who and why contracts are signed is the real meat for long hold.
Spoken like a true autist.

Then your gonna lose it all in options

quality post right here.
I hope Santa brings me tendies this year
Will to live pleas fly again.
bought the dip today. its one of the only EV companies that makes actual money. That has actual clients. They have Coco cola, fedex, pepsi all as clients. Where pieces of shit like NKLA and FSR have never produced a single unit.

citron pumped it which makes me a little wary, but it was already 26 or 27 before they tweeted, and i got in at \~30. so think the rrisk reward is good. anyeways i have Feb options so i can wait it out a bit

&#x200B;

also: mkt cap is less than NKLA who hasnt produced a single truck i believe. XL sells to blue chip companies
Stock value drops after they pay dividends, it pretty much evens out lol
Lol you’re already up like 5% if you bought at 211
Nice work Dave
Sir Jack posts accurate DD about actually solid company, it happens to get featured on the news, price goes up and stays up.

There are tons of pump and dumps on this sub but it's moronic to say that this is one of them.
Lmao
Well yeah obviously which is why I said “if you’re holding for a long time.” It’s a probabilistic statement that you probably won’t time it right over a long period of time lol. Don’t worry I still YOLO options too
That’s an expensive call tho

SPACs are the way.
They will upsell you to use long Form 1040 and again for Schedule D capital gains/losses. Probably about $80, but there are discount codes you can find to drop the cost $15/$25. Your bank, brokerages, or employer may have a deal, or just Google it. I’ve been using them for years, like having all my records in one place, and also pay extra for audit protection. Money well spent, if you ask me.
Is that... Good? For your trades?
hh less gain is better than this lost.
Yeah man it's like xbox live with all the features.  I wish they had a voice chat too.
I also like anal page views

Nono. Consumer electronics ONLY. If they MUST do accessories, legit 1 style of cable 2 lengths, 1 charger only, 1 basic clear case only (cell phone for example), 'tested the best' only like Costco but honestly if it were up to me, I wouldnt carry ANY accessory. Different from facebook, there is no "meet up with a stranger" aspect.

Tight tight focus, rolling only one category at a time as they master each one while also ensuring their brand image does not turn into a pawnshop.

Even limit to 2 years old device max at first. This also incentivizes you to stay current, because after 2 years your device has no resale value/you have to go through the hassle of selling otherwise.

Cheers mate 🍻
I thought this was a casino?
When did you sell? Or are you still holding?
Wait so once a quarter at market closes I can just put my entire account in some stock that has a high ass dividend, and then immediately at market open the next day I can sell it and buy back my regular holdings at market open?  That sounds like an easy-peasy 6-7% extra a year?  Can I actually do this each quarter with multiple stocks in a row?  Idk if companies pay dividends like all on the same day?  I’ve got to be missing something or everyone would be doing this.

Which broker is this?
🚀🚀🚀🚀
say so - doja cat
My background is in nanotechnology and mechanical engineering, with a brief stint in finance after school. I spent a little time on biomed (my thesis was actually about gene therapy nano particle vectoring for cystic fibrosis patients) but I love machines too so now work in manufacturing.

There are still 5,000-8,000 monogenic diseases out there. Many polygenic diseases can also show the 80-20 effect by which I mean, fixing one of the mutations has a disproportionately significant effect (enough to be an effective symptom or quality of life treatment, if not a cure) even if many are left untouched. Of course we are not ready to begin human clinical trials on a wide scale but animal lab studies are in progress. Recently a Chinese researcher used CRISPR to edit the CCR5 gene out of human fetuses. Those children are now alive and immune to HIV (although it was an egregious ethical transgression in the eyes of most science professionals to do that without knowing the potential consequences or consulting the industry about human genetic editing ethical standards). Later got sued for it or something. Google the name He Jiankui. The point is public awareness and motivation for scientific experimentation around the technology are making big strides recently. 

Individual genetic mutations do occur that can confound targeting and yes cas9 can make errors in site selection. Book-ending the active protein with cas9 instead of just one helps, as does appending RNA “hairpins” to help with specific targeting. Those hairpins have been shown to 50x targeting accuracy (Thats off the top of my head, so don’t quote me but I remember the figure I read was at least an order of magnitude increase). Also keep in mind in the future we will likely be able to sequence a patient’s genome down to the base pairs and account for those unexpected discrepancies. The main question for me is how long that will remain too cost prohibitive for widespread adoption. 

There will be plenty of developmental and regulatory barriers along the way but that’s the case for any new medical technology. Old school pharma fails in phase III 95% of the time too. It doesn’t mean they don’t rake it on on the products that actually go to market. I think this sector would behave similarly, but the ones that land will go way bigger way faster. Many small biotech shops you know of are struggling to do the same thing Pfizer does with similar technology and way less resources. This is something entirely different

If they start with the diseases that are easiest to target and aim for limited-scope application therapies that improve QOL instead of a one time cure-all treatment I think they can do it
And ICLN

It's Tinder's algorithm to punish robots and people who swipe right on all. It rewards real people who are realistic about swiping in their league. I'm an average looking guy and I've never had a problem getting cute-ish matches because I learned about ELO

well whatever you get the idea.
I don't see how it's less risk, less reward for sure. If the entire market (spy) takes a dump, why would dividend stocks be unscathed
could be a while. today was a write off tho. every hhigh flying stock sold off on low volume
oof
What songs do y'all listen to while you trade? I've been throwing this one on a lot lately: [Sisters of Mercy - Dominion / Mother Russia](https://youtu.be/0NqBJQksIIo)

I like it because it was written at the tail of the cold war by some British goth intellectual and it shouts out Ozymandias and then compares Lloyd's of London to blind men and mine workers and accuses Reagan of being a Russian puppet and it ends on a posadist prayer for Russia to nuke America but if you play it in reverse it says "have mercy" a bunch of times so that there's some voodoo shit going on where every time you play it you might think you're praying for nuclear dominion but actually you're being cancelled out by a prayer for world peace. Pretty nifty shit. I feel like it gets the devil to stay out of my way and I can just vibe with Putin the richest man alive and f e e l the market when this song is playing. Right now I'm listening to it and it's telling me the market is closed so yep the sixth sense checks out
As far as I'm concerned every other user is a bot and reddit is a one player game
That's fucking hot

Well heres what happened to me today while my entire portfolio was bleeding -- which became a theme for the day.  Wife was on her period, I didnt get laid, she somehow got a backrub and convinced me to go buy her a new blood red minivan.
There you go
11 year old cousin left his switch at my house this evening, looking to pawn it for some weeklies. If your interest hmu ASAP. Merry Christmas :)
Kind of reminds me of the lame joke about the guy who won’t let his wife waste money in Vegas playing slot machines. When she asks about him losing money playing blackjack, he says “But I know what I’m doing.”
How dare you

I got PFE 12/31 36p today. The pump is over

I made a lot of money on PRPL. It wasn't hard assuming you didn't YOLO into retarded short term OTM calls
You still have money in your account, what's the big deal?
Here’s some flair
Sir, this is a casino.
It’s on the pink sheets. Don’t even have to look it up to confirm it’s a pump and dump
If it smells and tastes as a pump and dump scheme, that’s because it is.
Sir this is a Wendy’s
Sadly no, I got spooked, bailed out at a loss on a dip, and now watch on as it climbs into the teens. Not the first time and won’t be the last.
I read this whole thing and feel worse about myself.  

You're banking on an earnings beat in Q4 to post a 5 year ATH based on what exactly?  New board members and layoffs?  Wouldnt the pop already have happened in that case?

The trading volume spiked up to 6M (from a 2M daily average) on the 18th and the stock has been flat since.

I'm not trying to be a jerk with you.  This was obviously a ton of work to put this together, but I'm not getting it.
Sorry, no way they will sell used with that margin.  Too much overhead, returns, and potential issues with the products.  Companies offer you half on used for a reason.

I am bullish gme but not based on a low margin used market.
Like literal sponsored ads bro

I’m not a fan of carts. I prefer either vaping flower or dabbing concentrates. Take some of your gains and buy yourself a vaporbrothers vaporizer. I’ve had the same one for the past 10 years and it still works very well. Vaporizing is the healthiest form of smoking. You bake, not burn, the herbs, and don’t inhale the carcinogens that are produced when you burn the herb. Your lungs will thank you

What made you buy in? I see it had a massive selloff last month.

I agree with that but for some of the titles but we still don’t know yet, I think Star Trek and big Nickelodeon franchises yes but Comedy Central stuff if it can generate more revenue by non exclusive deals I’m down. I just want to see a much larger original slate. And I want to see them use more showtime content on Pluto and sign more deals like the recent Netflix deal for narcos. They could have the global leader in free streaming.
Plausible.

There are only 30 ICU beds remaining for 10 million people in LA county. I believe the number 2 weeks ago was 92? Basically, get it while u can cuz we’re about to be sold out of hospital space

Haha yes.  My 3% gain this year is much higher than average.
This same sub when PLTR got shit on by Citron kept posting for everyone to "keep buying the dips" when there was a massive sell-off, trying to prop PLTR up on everyone's bank accounts. Now these same people are acting as though they don't engage in at best questionable practices? Fuck this sub is getting ridiculous.

Dude Jesus fucking christ how is it a pump and dump if it pumped and didnt dump. The dude made me 15k over night
I can already tell how much smart you are than me.... keep climbing you fucking retard you
I was wondering where the other post about his schemes went. Mods are obvi in on it. The amount of money you can make being a mod to this sub is insane. You could literally get rich. We make jokes about retarded this and autist that but there's some pretty smart people that chime in here with really good plays/ideas. And mods are 1st person to see the DDs with all the juicy tendie potential.
🙌🙌
Save some for csps and wheel it.
Gonna wait for the market crash nd buy
Dude get a life. If you think WSB has the pull that these massive hedge funds and banks do that pump and dump stocks right and left, then you’re seriously deluded. They’re the real criminals and don’t ever let anyone tell you otherwise. Ever heard of Citron? They pump shit so they can short it on FUCKING TWITTER FOR THEWORLD TO SEE. Get the fuck outta here. 

Edit: I come to WSB so I can attempt to make some money so maybe I don’t have to work until I’m 65 when my body is shriveled from arthritis. Like yay 35 years from now I’ll have 500k after putting some money away in my employer matched 401k that trades bonds and slow growing ETFs so I can drive the same Toyota Camry years from now because 500k ain’t worth shit due to hyper inflation. Fuck you boomer. Fuck that. 

Let us momentum trade in high volume stocks without always being accused of pumping and dumping shit. I know I speak for my brethren that maybe we can escape this bullshit rat race game of life if we make a few good trades so we can live how we want to live during our prime years. 

End rant
Buy high, sell low
Happens to me every time I sell a stock
What else am I supposed to do with my money? Let inflation eat it alive in my .5% savings account?

I want her to nickname my dick "the ark"
It still blows my mind that in 2021 basically we still don't have a highly successful product or even consulting firm who specializes in this shit. I mean having double digit internal systems isn't exactly a new phenomenon, I mean sure, it may be "relatively* new as in this decade it got more mainstream, but you'd think there was something out there.

I know tools like mulesoft exist (crm 🚀) but that doesn't do the grunt work of really fine tuning the data governance. That's a huge part of the puzzle...
Are you sure about that? Because I am 70.39528% sure that sopht is not a bot.

I had never purchased a single stock before GME was $9.00. 

I had not even heard about GME until after the the Corp's leader with the hoodie's DD which was when Microsoft agreement popped. 

It's not too late. I had a few 7x+ baggers (small, nothing life changjng/nothing to envy.) closed today. Shares are better at this point though unless IV comes down. 

Hmmm thinking about IV got me wondering... with GME being the meme stock it is, if scalpers spread 'believable' rumors to profit. Today, even 0dte was pricy imo.
The shorts can conspire like this too I suppose, to create 'disappointment' to cause a sell off and take some steam out of the wsb train. This might have been what happened today. There were some hype making today out to be a squeeze day. Lol

Diamond hand guys.
This is the way.

yeah but same issues apply to AGNC, it's not at precovid levels even. still down 25% from early year highs.

Thats the way
Hey, shares or options on tsla?
Na
I don't buy the $100 + short squeeze theory. But that hasn't stopped me from holding shares in case it bleeds up.

 I misunderstood short interest ratio, so I know nothing either. Should have done some research first.
Go hog hunting bro, rotund bitches need love too
TTD?
Obvious pumping and dumping ?
[deleted]
You can get USOI right now for $5~. 

If you were fine with a yolo that pays a range of,

-  .0300~ to .1229~. 

- Per month avg TTM is .2646~

Close in dividend per month. 

To AGNC if you take the stability per month. That AGNC is known for into account.

This month USOI would've been $2600 for OP. If he put all in. 

Definitely not a "super" safe + high yield bet like AGNC. For the risk to safety it's a decent alternative.
u/sir_jacks_a_lot posted about a ticker that technically broke the subs rules. It moved like 0.4% after he posted it (could be a total coincidence) the next morning that same ticker was featured in a news segment and it pumped like 22% and he got banned because people accused him of pumping, when it was the news.
Good bot
Son of a bitch, I’m in.

If you never add any money to this account and continue gaining 50.98% every 3 months, you'll be a billionaire within 10 years.

That's also assuming no dividends.

Edit: formula was off, doing 59.8% for all but the first 3 months. After correcting the formulas, it would still be over 100 million dollars, though.
I just want it to hit 270 by March. My expectations are so much lowered
Should I just go all in 1200 shares PLTR and theta gang that shit with covered calls?

Can Cohen even pull out at this point without being investigated? I'm sure there are lots of technicalities but he straight up admitted his involvement is the reason the stock is up.

If you don't keep your phone on life support, how the fuck is it going to obey you? Just like with anything if you keep it close to death and carefully monitor the only thing that keeps it alive you have undying loyalty.
The fact that all Chinese tech companies have been engaged in anti-competitive behavior for 20 years and it is only now, that BABA, after Ma spoke out, is being investigated, shows that it is politically motivated.

If it weren’t politically motivated then the CCP would have just been cracking down on all companies over the past 20 years.
Probably an unpopular opinion, but there’s no way in hell I’d touch options.

Yeah, they faked stuff like rolling a truck downhill to make it look like they had a working truck. They were showing off a touchscreen interface in a truck that turned out to be a picture saved as the wallpaper on a laptop. They claimed they were producing hydrogen at an impossibly low cost - in reality they had not produced any hydrogen. Milton also purchased designs for the trucks from a student project. None of it was his work.

Everytime something bad happens, it becomes apparent they were lying about everything. When their deal with GM started to unravel, we all got to see that they needed GM to not only produce the Badger, but provide all the battery and engine technology because they didn't have any. When the garbage truck deal fell through, it is again apparent that they lied about their capabilities. There are other companies already making electric garbage trucks, so it's not like it's some impossible dream. Nikola just isn't capable of it.

If you hear anyone from Nikola talk about a new plan or initiative, just know that it doesn't exist.
use Grindr instead. then we‘ll swipe right on each other
This is the way
How is STIC a pump and dump, when we get a million approved GME posts. All those bots are literally advocating for a short squeeze and spam “buy shares”.
FLASH SALE!!!  Scoop up some BABA 20% off!  Who knows how long these deals will last??
Exactly this. Pay the extra few bucks to TurboTax to get the trades entered properly into your Schedule D.

Bottom line: If you have trading losses, you can deduct up to $3K from this year’s income and rollover remaining losses to next year, and so on.
No I’m not accusing him of that, I just don’t think it’s good advice to forget about any investment for two years. Sure it’s good to be patient, but you should always be following your investments actively.
No. Someone likes you, apparently.

No shame in that bro
what happens if it moons 9:30-9:40 trades sideways for 10 more minutes then tanks? or if it dumps first 30 minutes then pumps the last 45 minutes of the day?
Capital gains are federal taxes. Every American living anywhere on earth has to pay them.
Cuz the rest are swiping left on you
I haven’t gotten many dividends in my time, but do you guys realize all you need to do is buy the stock the day before the ex-dividend date, and than hold it until after market open on the ex-dividend date.

I didn’t realize it was that short of a time period. Not bad. As long as you can get out at break even or better it’s a win win.

It doesn’t, they probably just wanted the stocks back so they can give them to the next autist from here who tries that. Either that or they realised that they gave apolloo PLTR

You're right though. Foil does two things. 1. Takes longer to heat up. 2. Traps moisture in the potato so you don't get no crackly oily skin. What a joke.

1500 oct 1 in webull. Is currently 2870. Feel bad when I see some of the gain posts here in wsb but at the same time I am up 52%  if I make 50% every 3 months I'm going to be a happy retard.

As paramount plus rolls out next year I think youll see a difference in some of those issues but Netflix overall is a very expensive streaming play to invest in and they will still use a large portion of ViacomCBS content in the catalog. They aren’t compete with Netflix as much as compete against HBO Max Peacock and the smaller services, Netflix has a different product that’s more broad than anyone else. Showtime will compete against HBO which has a lack of leadership. Disney is competing more with their bundle against Netflix at a high price point. the SVOD business is wide open and I’m even more bullish on Fast and Showtime. We don’t have enough info on Paramount Plus 2 year slate which is the entire reason there is outsized upside on the trade. It’s a show me now story. So once you see the slate you can make up your mind. I’ve seen enough and know where I’m placing bets.

I hate the guy but I will tell you something. He did shake up the normies and they'll never be the same. Not the political process because absent a civil war that won't change.

But he basically shattered normal political positions among voters. Take a look at the nytimes analysis of how major cities shifted towards trump this year. He effectively convinced a group of younger minorities that voting D means you're a wage slave forever and voting R means a chance at prosperity.


Bad dude all around and one if I shook hands with I'd check all my pockets and wrist to make sure nothing was missing but he was highly effective at breaking up the passive political thought pattern.

Depends on if I see a large catalyst in the horizon, if the news has hit then I definitely sell.

I'm currently sitting on some gme calls that have appreciated a lot but I feel confident that better gains are on the horizon so I'm chilling. Usually I'm happy to leave at 50-100% gain though, reminding myself that that amount of gain blows away what you'd get with regular stock.

I also spent like 70$ on 35$ calls that were worth like 800% more and I almost definitely should've sold before they went back to earth but I sometimes I just need to scratch that itch lol

This is classic WSBets misinformation. 

1. Buying shares does not mean they are unavailable for shorting - your broker may still lend them out.
2. Buying calls, especially when they go ITM can cause MM buy shares to delta hedge
Saw a post yesterday that one of the mods quit and turned off some bots
During the March crash, some SPACs did drop under $10 but not too much, stayed above $9 and went back up above $10 eventually. Biggest downside I guess is waiting for it to do something while missing out on other trades. Once the merger completes though, no more $10 floor.
Haha.  It's all just memes and jokes around here.  No one here actually thinks highly of Cramer.  We are just excited he chose to finally acknowledge us, even if it was an ill botched attempt to get new viewers.  Everyone knows to inverse Cramer 90% of the time
I think so, it seems to be the move lately, just get out when it pumps.  Pick one that looks like it has potential to get some momentum via who owns it or the bs product they may sell
Pumping barkbox? You must be demented. Look at all the THC 🐝 posts and what kind of clusterfuck pump that is
I’m a bit confused about how being an LGBTQ girl who’s married to a guy works. Now that you’re the breadwinner in your house are you going to start pegging your husband or are you going to start cucking him with other chicks? Or are you gonna do both?
Friends are ok but a girlfriend is a better start. It can be very awkward in the beginning, so having a relationship with your model can help a lot. I built my portfolio by reaching out to models on Instagram. You can definitely offer your work for free in the beginning, but I would try and keep that to a minimum (maybe let them use some shots on their social media). Goodluck!

Fintech: SQ, PYPL, and I’m playing a minor position in poop c o I n for the lulls. If it prints me 100x I’ll be surprised but pleased. Also more traditional companies like Visa are still dominant in global payments and will benefit from the trend. Conviction buys on SQ PYPL especially 

AI/Robotics/automation: my main AI buy was c3.ai right at IPO open. Companies like NVDA IBM google and twilio have AI units but they’re not pure play AI. ServiceNow (enterprise software) has been acquiring AI firms too. I like alteryx for AI but not as much these days. There just aren’t many pure play AI public tickers so I do lean on ETFs here. For robotics: intuitive surgical is the gold standard but has cooled off recently, but teradyne is my conviction buy there. Automation ADSK is #1. Rockwell automation. Most of these companies are somewhat involved in more than one of the sectors I mentioned so the lines get blurry. 

Telemedicine: TDOC more sustained value, M3 for potential rocket 

Genomics: CRSP, EDIT, NTLA (this last one hasn’t popped as hard yet so good time to enter, room to run)

Cybersecurity: NET, CRWD

3D printing: stratasys 

IoT I don’t really have a good single ticker. I have a ton of ETFs like WCLD, SNSR, etc. BOTZ, there are many many ETFs in these sectors you could look up the holdings if you want to dig deeer

That seems like a very specific situation given that steel production or output can be considered part of national security and or domestic policy. Also AliBABA sells commodities among other things.  what advantage would China gain by limiting its potential market. Theirs a obvious risk to this but no more then throwing money at AMC. U may be right in the end who knows but given the size of this company it won’t be going anywhere anytime soon I don’t think. Even if I make 800$ I’ll be happy but the chances of this falling below 200$ is very low. Also it seems like a local provincial govt did that I’d imagine the central govt would handle BABA and doing something like that would shatter any image of China being safe for investment

Not enough for sure, I’ve been kind of trading off my own gut. I have started looking at RSI, MACD, and Volume indicators but I definitely think I need more experience to make confident plays off those. Today I thought the MACD indicator was a go for GME but obviously that was a bust 😅

I haven’t done terribly portfolio wise, I bled from 7000 all the way to 1.8k on SLV calls (what didn’t help was that I took a day trade ban and diamond handed the slv calls hoping for a pump that never came) from July to November 4, but am now back up to 6.2 on my Robinhood from NIO, QQQJ, PLTR, JOE, CRSR, and GME being my biggest gains

Death it shall be
Great question. I'm keen to find out, and will be thrilled if they have made a breakthrough beyond Li+ ion, or any new chemistry even if it includes Li. But I haven't heard any inklings. 

I was disappointed by Musk's announcement on Battery Day. I was hoping for new chemistry but he rolled out an incremental architecture improvement which, while heralding a big performance improvement, is not very innovative. The new battery that QS has announced is a light-year ahead of Tesla.

There are three categories of chemistry that I would expect to see in upcoming EV battery releases. 

1) Lithium-sulfur. The energy density of this chemistry is extremely high, but there are significant challenges. Similar to the battery QS developed, lithium metal is part of the cycle, and this can form dendrites that puncture the separator and short the battery. It's also fairly flammable. But if AAPL manages to overcome this with a solid electrolyte or other engineering innovation, it would be a huge development. that would greatly extend the distance a car could drive without a charge.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium%E2%80%93sulfur_battery

2) Metal-air. Similar advantages & similar challenges to Li-S, but more possibilities in the anode metal. Many are being explored in labs around the world.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lithium%E2%80%93sulfur_battery

3) Intercalation cathode with Na+ or K+ ions, or possibly divalent ions like Ca2+ or Mg2+. The architecture of these cells would be similar to Li+ ion batteries, where the ions are shuttled into a lattice on charge or discharge. Different electrode lattices can accommodate different ions. In my undergrad I worked on Prussian Blue analogue cathodes with K+ ions, and there is a lot of research still going on in this area. These can provide environmental benefits or ease of manufacture compared to Li+ ion batteries, but have so far been much lower capacity than Li+. So I doubt they will be used in cars unless someone makes a big breakthrough.

https://www.greencarcongress.com/2019/01/20190128-natron.html

4) Honorable mention goes to the 3D architecture of Dr. Amy Prieto of Prieto Battery and Colorado State University. It's typical Li+ ion chemistry but the copper foam substrate architecture improvement is way ahead of anything Tesla is doing.

What is your background? I am a big believer in genomics too. however i have been reading a lot and it seems like science is just not there yet. We just don’t understand genetic underpinnings of most complex diseases. Apart from monogenic diseases, most diseases are caused by many different genetic mutations and environment so a tool such as crispr while revolutionary for basic science is simply not adequate. Also it seems like crispr has its limitations. I read that cas9 is error prone and cutting DNA seems to cause an aging like effect on the cell. I was surprised to learn crsr fixed sickle cell on human patient. This is very promising but a lot of genetics/biotech seems to come up with miracle cures on lab only to fail phase III. 

I am not doubting you. Just truly want to understand this and hopefully ride this once in a lifetime opportunity. What do you think about these points? Also what is your background?

It’s only a matter of time before this sub wil get taken down for facilitating pump and dump schemes. They guy we are taking about got banned, but later unbanned prolly by the mods who are in on it.
Are you sure about that? Because I am 98.95196% sure that MakerofMarkets is not a bot.

How do I find these companies before they go up like that?
Who cares
Do they do this in practice before this options wave of 2020? Or did they just write them naked and cover with cash? Retail theta probably writes CC on shares but I always figured most banks would probably write naked OTM calls.

The medicinal effects of THC have literally been proven to offset the harmful effects of the smoke to varying degrees, with good high-THC weed likely getting enough of this effect to completely cancel out the harmful effects. It doesn't really have harmful effects on the heart to cancel out in the first place, just medicinal effects on the vast majority of cells in the body.

China has done it before but for companies with a much smaller valuation. Also it wouldn’t be Baba that decides to randomly cancel the contracts, it would be the government that writes legislation causing them to be invalidated.
Which platform do you use to check these?
depends spy might be better over like 5-10 years but if he wants that house in 2 years may not really do much in a big fund. some years are negative historically also thats why they say to invest in S&p 500 funds when you plan to keep the money there very long term

Your daily margin should be enough to eat into ITM exercising.

You do it in chunks and sell the stock right away (and hope the spread/volume is decent too), you will pay a price but not as badly as the guy trying to offload a low volume ITM option.

You son of a bitch you did it. How does one do this
Bout tree fiddy
Yeah - agreed, but it's tough when you see shit rally after closing when you have time left.

For those 600% calls, I'm curious when you are happy with the gains and sell? Like you had to make a conscious effort to hold pass 200%, 300%, etc. In other words, when is it enough to sell.

I'm always worried that if I hold, the underlying could tank and I can see my gains get wiped out, which has happened all too many times.
The top is sooooo close. Also ban
Yeah that’s easy.

I feel for ya, but there's a reason why even call holders \*khm\*pumpers\*khm\* recommend stocks. Sure, you can do calls, but you can get burned easily, and now you're seeing it in practice.

It's better to take less gains and enjoy orders of magnitude lower risk, but still be in position to potentially take a 3x+ gain in a few short months
Shares are the play in a short squeeze. Short sellers are only out 0.4% in interest to hold their position for a week. In that same time you are out 100% in time value decay.
Triple-dip recession
One this degenerate sub? Prolly like 60%
We need you to jump in to force the squeeze more. The more we work together providing upward price pressure, the more we make the shorts sweat.
I hate boomers
This kind of stock expires
Do none of you degens have rule 34 Cathie Ark?!
[deleted]
Bingo; in general yes because there isn't a very close performance replacement that is also cost advantaged. We're not going to build skyscrapers out of legos. 

But the concern would be projects (especially private) may get shelved for the time or reduced in scope to meet budgets. I would doubt it would be a huge hit compared to any gains.

I'm curious about the % of ppl here that use margin. What's y'alls guess?
Basically. People don't really get that in the real world. There are legit types that if you cross they will turn over every rock to screw you over and there is no recourse. Either the fix is in or people are afraid of them. Works the same way in the job force. In some fields if you cross person x then good luck finding a job you're on a blacklist

There are a lot of misconceptions about federal labor law. Another one is break requirements - federal law doesn’t have any, though some states might. Federally and in Iowa, there is no requirement for a lunch break or any other breaks on on 8-hour shift or a 12-hour shift or any other shift, though there may be requirements for restroom access.

Losses are applied against gains up to your total gains.  Of what's left you get to deduct $3,000 from your ordinary income and carry the rest of the loss forward to offset next year's gains.  Some states do not carry excess losses forward to future years

MVIS was the most recent one that got pumped to oblivion and then dumped the next day. It was rumored that MVIS was going to be acquired by Apple and the entire story was related to Electric Vehicles and LIDAR technology, which is hot shit right now.

My hunch is that the market doesn't care about market cap when they pump and just tunnel visions on the stock price, which was at $5 at the time. My bet was that by $10, people would start questioning the market cap of around 1.5 billion for this mediocre company. Sold options right before the market closed.

Guys if you think about the S&P as a main holding forever is actually retarded. Companies only make it in after they are already huge and consistently profitable and priced in and can’t moon. Boomers holding SPY forever will get clapped by the lucky retards who find companies working on the FUTURE best things in technology
Do me do me
So MT is doing the same amount of production, just can't keep up with demand? Can any competitor step in and fill the shortage?
The end is bad advice. Don’t forget about it for two years. There is a good likelihood that this might Hertz after the squeeze demand goes away.

I honestly don’t have a specific one I’m interested in at the moment after these two. I recommend looking for high growth targets near nav. Don’t chase the high flyers you missed out on.

I have quite a bit riding in Nvidia and Wayfair calls for March! Really hoping for a green tech week next week! 😟😟😟

A bit worried. Maybe I should have waited till next week or till Jan before buying calls? 🤔
If it makes you feel better I have 500 shares at $20.95. Not super worried. There will be more pumps before this falls.
Only thing I'm worried about is a decent sized market wide correction that lasts a couple of weeks like September which could possibly happen. Gonna have to keep a close watch.
The 200 is MSFT?
Why the fuck so many upvotes. I thought there was an unspoken rule you gotta lose or make at least 50k to get this many upvotes. This is some bullshit fucking retard simps. Smh 😔

Does anyone know what's the effects of smoking weed using a joint vs a cart vs a pod. I want to know what effects they have on the health (heart/lungs) compared to each other, smoking cigs, and no smoking at all. Is there a study/some reference i can find. Its overwhelming to google since theres so much information out there. Im sure someone here smokes and researched the health effects. please let me know thanks.

Look at the Netflix content spend, a majority of it is wasted. Viacom can produce a large portion of the content required for Netflix Amazon and any one else that needs productions capacity and additional content. It’s not the same as the leaders in SVOD. Showtime will do well paramount will do well Pluto will do very well and VIAC will be a huge player in the supply chain and a key distributor. It’s closer to a pure content play than any other major media firm.

Where’s an example of where these contracts have been canceled before? Also Jack Ma was ousted from his position as CEO years ago no ones betting on jack ma their betting on the fact that Ali baba has positioned itself into being an essential pillar of Chinese commerce a fact which isn’t even disputable. I’m aware of the u don’t actually own any shares argument. AliBABA does a lot of business all around the world no one believes their simply going to say haha thanks for the free money and cancel the contracts. This isn’t some Rupert Murdoch money scheme where you give them money and u get false promises.
It all depends. For one, I do my best not to pay attention to the insane wins posted here bc that shit is not the norm.

What I've been doing lately is keeping to my conservative plays and occasionally buying some very cheap lotto calls to scratch the itch. Up 600% these last three months so I think it's working out

Lol Jack Ma literally roasted Xi and the CCP in public, then when Xi got mad and indicated he was gonna cancel the Ant IPO, Ma tried sucking up. Too little too late, Baba is going sub 200. Also the shares you buy on the NYSE aren’t actual shares, u don’t get ownership in the company. It’s a VIE which gives u a share of the profits but China has canceled those contracts before and can do so whenever it wants.

Some have several. How many cars do you see on the road? Each sale will generate thousands in tax revenue.

The wealthy cheat the tax man billions of dollars.  The implication of a higher GST will prevent them from cheating or writing off personal expenses as a "business expense". The program will extract billions from the wealthy class, and they'll be forced to stay in the country because of their company and all the investors who profit from it.

There is no cap on warrant gains but it's incorrect to assume that warrant price will go up to meet stock price, often the stock price falls to match the warrant price due to pipe and warrant dilution.  But yes, the risk discount goes away and the price gap between warrant price and stock price closes once exercise is possible.
Hey Bro, I want gains like you.

How hot is your mom?
With calls, when do you guys normally sell your positions? 

I usually buy monthlies (or further out if price is okay) and have been selling with plenty of time left and before decay (>2 weeks left) to give me cushion in case it drops. 

Last few plays, the underlying has skyrocketed after I sold with plenty of time (PRPL and RIOT for example), so I realized 30-75% gain instead of 5x+. 

How do you guys balance being safe and closing out for a marginal gain versus holding?
STIC and wait.
I was just wondering that myself
They just deleted this post, which is all you need to know.

You're thinking of gst as an income tax.

You need to also keep in mind there would be no capital gains, income taxes, or property taxes.

This will enable class mobility. You can choose to spend very little one month and end up paying next to nothing in taxes.

The wealthy spend much more money then a poor person does. And thus will pay much more taxes.

I like the smell
An option is the right to buy 100 shares of the underlying stock at a strike. So you can have more options than shares available. And writing or buying an option doesn't increase of decrease the share count or the float available. 

If you buy 5 shares and decide to hold then in theory there is less shares available for purchase for other buyers.

If you make 14% a week, every week for a year, starting with $530, you will have $482,000. That’s an ROI of about 90,000%. I’ll be honest, I like your chances.  I mean, just because you’ve had a negative ROI so far over your entire trading career, who’s to say next year you won’t outpace the S&P by 89,980%?

For those of you wondering how to figure this, which I assume is most of you:  take a calculator and put in 530, then multiply it by 1.14, then push the equals sign. This is what you’ll have if you make 14%. Then push the equals sign again. That’s what you’ll have if you make 14% on that. Then push it again, that’s what you’ll have if you make 14% on that.  Push equals 52 times. That’s your annual compounding return making 14% every week. 

For ROI, net profit divided by initial investment multiplied by 100. 

Some quick advice too- I’d go for 2 years of this strategy, because $482,000 isn’t enough to retire on in this day and age.  14% a week for two years starting with $530 would leave you with $438 million. That should be enough. 

I believe this will likely be achieved.
Isint there a rule about gain/loss posts having to be over 2k
I don't get why buying options affects the amount of available shares. And when you buy shares this affects the amount of available shares. I really don't understand what he means.
Same here brotha. Hoping we’re all A-OK next year. Merry Xmas
Check out TastyWorks.  Their charts are absolute shit but their platform is AWEAOME for trading spreads.  Low commissions too.
Automod daily threads and zeejayzee quit 😔 we are far from great
Diamond handed bulls had a great previous 2 months.
I know right. But the fundamentals are there for the hype to fuel long-term adoption not just a pump and dump. Even if there's a bubble in pricing against how fast these companies' operations are actually growing, we are way below the level at which I could call these sectors fairly valued. 

If you're too impatient then yeah wait for a correction so it can rip but time in the market beats timing the market if you're holding for a long time, which I plan to

Okay so should I buy in for more now at current price or do you think there may be a small dip early next week?

I guess from the over all tone of your post the answer is shut up and buy now and hold

My top tips (Lessons learned)

1. Come up with a thesis with your play
2. cut you losses early if your thesis isnt working
3. never hurts to take profit
4. do not play FDs unless you are okay with -100% 

For example I bought puts because I thought more covid and shutdowns would tank the market. There was more covid and shutdowns and market didnt budge, so I cut my losses.

its better than a stimulus check
Thanks. I’m just looking for clarity on when the redemption call can happen at the earliest. Using my example, if they merged in March and the stock climbs to $75, 30 days after the merger I can buy my warrants at $23 and sell the shares at $75? My point here is to find out whether in that case PS can call the redemption the day after the merger and take those warrants (since it’s above 36 for that entire month).

Put another way, is there anything in the agreement that makes it impossible for me to exercise those warrants when the stock is well over $36 or is my upside capped at 36 for warrants.
CANT WAIT

Yeah but I’m fucking retarded
The only success I've had lately

Edit: for clarity, I don't play astrological patterns like head and shoulders or whatever, but I have learned to follow the trend, watch for bullish price action and buy off of the moving averages and lower trendlines, take profits at resistance and fib retracement levels. Biggest key here is learning to buy off support on red days
If congress actually gave a shit about the investors they’d ban algos instead of this PDT bullshit...

Change my mind.
Webull and I don’t trust them. They won’t let me withdraw the last few dollars I have left in there. I just use ToS and pay the 65¢/contract + regulation fees. Cost to run a business.

Volume went down by a lot for the latter part of the day. The charts to me look like BABA has a new pair of shoes and a new base to ground it. 

I think the base might change slightly into the middle of next week especially with people who find they don’t have the heart to stay in by Monday morning.

After that I think baba is going to run. This all being dependent on how the news looks coming up — but it looks like the CCP is just flexing it’s muscles as a warning.

Alipay is the future of financial technology and major government and private banks worldwide are all watching Alipay very closely. China doesn’t want to fuck up their chance at having very literally the biggest asset in the world — which is why Alipay was so highly regarded.

Short of Jack Ma being assassinated and assets being seized i think BABA is going up up up
dont roth’s have a yearly contribution limit?
If people bought baba it's on them, it was their choice to buy not cramer's. He is just a guy with an opinion, people need to think for themselves.

Been buying shares AND options. GME TO THE FUCKING MOON 🚀🚀🚀🚀
His reasoning is solid. I only observe WSB and rarely buy any of the talked about stock (GME, TSLA, PLTR, etc.) but this guy had some solid reasoning and I had cash lying around.
This just shows that China stocks are just not worth it. Small companies might be making up their earnings reports or not even exist in reality. Big companies might be taken down by the government at any time. Stocks are hard enough without this kind of black swan stuff.
Ah I guess I must be using the word “ai” wrong. I assumed it meant something along the lines of a program that can take data it hasn’t seen before and come to an acceptable output.
Lmao
I always lose also, just try n learn from the losses and play conservative. Go into shares instead of options for a bit
been a good december. up 17%, broke 25k so that's been a relief. still down 11.7% AT, so hoping to make that up in the next 6-8 weeks. 🙏🏽

Right now the idea is that a short seller accepts an annual loss of 20.2% for as long as they hold the position. And this is why short term calls are such a terrible idea. Options are just tradeable contracts and don’t affect the float of shares trading. If the stock stays flat, a short seller will lose 0.4% in interest in a week, while an OTM, FD call holder’s contracts will go to zero.
They don’t “suck” but usually skimp on things like power supply, mobo, case quality and low quality RAM. But they’ll have the CPU/GPU combo. 

Get yourself a good quality PSU, NVME/SSD, screen and case since those are permanent. Then find yourself a good deal on an AMD cpu (good luck lol) and then sell your ass so you can afford a mid-range GPU. Then GTFO of this sub, you’re in the wrong place nerd.

Would recommend just watching a bunch of youtube videos on how shorting works.

longstory short: you make money on stocks rising because you have positive shares. So if you have negative shares you make money on them dropping.

Really just go watch a ton of youtube videos.

Anytime a stonk sells off, like BABA, that creates resistance to any future increase. It can overcome eventually, especially with good news, but betting on a quick recovery for BABA, is well, stupid.

Whether we like it or not, the unspoken truth is that first and foremost this sub is a vehicle for pump and dumps. But so is Robinhood. And dont even get me started with brokers featuring "social trading " (aka pump and dump on steroids). 

It's a real issue for which the laws and regulations were never meant to deal with.  30 years ago, no one could imagine commission free trade from a smartphone while also being able to coordinate your trades with millions of strangers at the same time would be possible.

i think its absolutely crazy that in this community, people display their losses like a badge in order to belong. and i’m not new here either, your sentence “fuck off bro i lost 23k in one day on lulu calls this is definitely for me” just struck me as fucking hilarious

Most of it just slots together. All you need to do is makes sure your motherboard supports your cpu (correct socket). Spreading thermal paste isn't all that scary but most amd CPUs come with some paste on them already if you don't want higher grade stuff.

Then just grab some ram, an SSD, and a gpu. Also a power supply which I would suggest to not skimp on, high rated psus are more energy efficient and less liable to break and if you go overboard with the amount of power supply you future proof yourself to stuff like newer gpus requiring lots of power.

both, all of a tons of shit. except SPACs. i can't bring myself to trade most of the meme'd up shit here. beginning of nov had a good chunk of AMD and BA, but have reduced those holdings by about 50%. i got caught with a thousand shares of BABA... so the idealistic, regretful me wishes i had taken a clue from the streak ending, but you can't read into stuff too much.

other holdings, aapl (was bagholding this, but the shares are now profitable), msft, and nvda (this one's been shit for the past week+).
This.  😂 exactly this
Buy shares
they have a fair amount of interest (15k+ preorders iirc, could be wrong), with close to zero marketing. i dont think getting interest is an issue, moreso the manufacturing portion. and for that, arent they partnering with an OEM?
I gained $80k from it as of today 😂😂
2021 gonna be start of the next great depression? or more bull run?

If the thread didn't confirm you have brain damage, this did. If China cared then Hong Kong wouldn't have been fucked so hard over the protests and riots. HK lib's most compelling self lie they made to themselves were "BUT CHINA WOULDNT SHOT ITSELF IN THE FOOT AND HURT HKEX!!!" Xi already showed that he is willing to send HKEX to dust if it means gaining complete and full control, now he has it and stocks are back to normal(except HSBC rip) while some are even at ATH. Why wouldn't he do the same to Alibaba? He can castrate BABA for a few months to take over company, then business as usual when he does it. Revenue isn't going anywhere, they are green with money. You don't own the actual fucking BABA stocks so whatever happens to your investments and money will not affect their main ecommerce revenue in anyway shape or form. You guys are beyond fucking retarded if you think he would care about you guys.

Pretty sure he tried but dems kept shutting it down. The polls said he was going to win a second term so they started blocking everything even if it included helping americans. Speaking of that there was a thing in 2017 that included the wall money before he got it via EO. The bill included the money AND mandatory parental leave for 10m+ corporations. It was one of the biggest wins ever for dems and parent related work rights. Reps put it in so trump could get unlimited wall money, it was a great compromise but they blocked it since it would hand trump a win. THEY BLOCKED MANDATORY PARENTAL WORK LEAVE.

Old people like that shit
The movie theatre industry is bound to go extinct .
yes and no. it's not a loss til you take it, and that's the risk on any play. it just went bigly against us. if you don't want to or can't hold on, take the hurt and move on. that's a hard thing to do for most people though.

if you're going to hold onto the stock, figure out what you might be okay with letting it go for, and sell calls against it. i fucked up earlier in the year and ended up holding like $300k worth of BA at an avg cost of $185. pull up a 6 month chart to get an idea of the dead money (and SO MUCH pain) i was holding... eventually exited with a gain. though not as big as i wished.

when it dipped to near $140, i figured what my acceptable loss was and sold Dec calls on it at $165! felt like shit when it rallied back from the dungeons of hell, but you know what, i told myself i'd be okay if it rebounded to that level ($165 + $7 in call premium) and that helped balance the fomo.

Why I'm extremely bullish on ICLN and why you should be too

Feel free to comment on what price you expect it to be at by EOY 2021

&#x200B;

* The strong and growing renewable energy trend is supported by Speedy Joe Buyden’s climate policies, increased global adoptions, and cheaper renewable electricity costs
* COVID-19 further pushed ESG conscious investors to sustainable investments
* ICLN may be the best ETF to capture the growing renewable energy trend (lowest cost entry, high trading volume)

Decided to fuck around and look up 5 random tickers and see how they performed between April until now.

All 5 I’ve never heard of and have vastly outperformed my mix of stocks and options.

I quit.

(See everyone Monday)
Lost a lot of money this week. Is the only way to get it back taking Ohio State over Clemson?
I love this type of shit. Godspeed
Bought some positions for fun. Definitely not risking any more due to the ccp.

Money is for security, health and freedom. After a certain amount, be wary of how much time you spend chasing more, as you may one day look back and say, why didn’t I just enjoy my freedom instead of wasting time. Find a number you want in savings to be secure, go for it, and leave never looking back. You will spend more time in the dirt than you will above it. Cherish it gentleman and women.

I know what the fuck a Roth is. I do a backdoor Roth every year bc I make too much. Dividend stocks are still gay. You have to look at total return. I’ll take a stock that goes up 15% vs a dividend stock that goes up 6% and pays 3%.
Thank god we at least have international markets for me to get my fix tonight.
When is $CCL restarting dividends ?!
Make sure to set some aside for tax if you sold.
The easy answer:  BRK-B trades at a book value of 1.25.  Go look up the book values of AAPL, KO, Merck, and other top stock holdings of BRK-B. They are all substantially higher. Many multiples higher. AAPL is BRK-B’s third largest equity holding. The market isn’t reflecting this in BRK-B by a massive margin.
that makes me feel a little better! yeah, i was quite surprised it spiked up so much
I’m invested in MCAC, noticed it goes down quite a bit, so it’d be gay bear if I see literally any profit when it goes up, sell, then buy back in at a lower price?
If Santa Clause really cares about us he wouldn’t let the stock market close tomorrow. Phony jolly guy if you ask me

Enabling just means that it encourages your behavior. You can make your own decisions while other people enable you. 90% of the people on WSB wouldn't know what an option was or which one to YOLO on without the encouragement of thousands of people on this subreddit. Ever since this sub became hot shit for the boomers to talk about, there's been an influx of actual dumb fuckers who take WSB advice as gospel and don't use their brains to make decisions.

Fuck man, don't be a real retard.

Think it can drop another 20-40 per share. So we could see 200, or even 180 per share in the next few months if they heat up a lot. Don't buy in all at once!
You can almost buy a S P A C share near nav and watch it go to 100+. Pick a spac with no revenue but with a game changing idea and you will do great. More speculation the better.
Just copped Fire and Fury by Michael Wolff. Good read or nah?
Why don't you just do something like " hey I'm starting my account with $280 and I'm going to hit 5 grand in 6 months and if i dont ill get a WSB tattoo" and post your trades along the way
Bro, I was going to all in on 1/8 but at the last fucking second I watched some rando fucking 500 subscriber YouTube channel who explained that the real squeeze won't begin until around march with Q4


He could've been wrong but I decided to go with 4/16 25$Cs and buy a lesser amount if it means I dont get absolutely fucked since I'm putting 3.5k down I might as well not get fucked you feel me and absolutely that was the way. 

Currently up 400$ still on gme , I'm going to continue buying minimum March calls or August but I recommend further dated calls if you want to play safe anyway!

Good luck!
Honestly, it’s not a terrible idea if you trade with some discipline.  I wish I hadn’t blindly listened to the advice that you “should never trade in a retirement account” as an absolute rule.  When considering how few options there are in 401k for most folks (not everyone has Brokerage Link or an equivalent feature), starting with IRA or a Roth IRA would have given me a huge boost.  Sure, you can’t deduct losses, but I don’t plan on needing that..
I see a picture of Elon, is he buying gamestop? I didn't read a word you wrote. Buying more shares.
For GME to still be a thing is to rely on physical sales. Although digital games are on the rise, there will always be people preferring physical games because it allows them to resell. The thing is though I don’t know if people will sell games to Gamestop with things like Facebook Marketplace and EBay.
“What a relief! We thought you were gay.”
I don’t think that means what you think it does. 

It means that if shorts want to cover, it will take them 5.6 days to do so.
Generally they only buy a small fraction of the 100 shares you are obligated to buy under a call option. They aren’t hedging 100%

Can SOMEONE do a DD post on BFT
Except longer to come back? I bought a lot today to lower my cost basis. Wonder if I should just sell monday at a loss or wait till 229 cost and sell at no loss. It will come back but may go to 180-200 before 230 and I want to free up the cash.
This is just statistics only retards vs company future retards betting on Jack Ma vs Leader of China. If Xi wins then BABA is going to be delisted. If Jack Ma wins then Xi gets deposed and China becomes capitalism, which coincides with the decapitation prophecy. Pray Xi loses or good luck with the class action suit to get BABA reinstated

Well said, I agree propping up zombie business and failing enterprises is ridiculous.  Just give regular people money I guarantee it will get spent and boost the economy.
Best day to sell on the 28th. They’ve had a steady uptick every 10 days. If u have calls on 15 I suggest letting them go on the 7

The market is not efficient.  That’s the biggest falsehood about the market.  Most people don’t read and learn what companies actually do. That’s the opportunity to develop an edge and make boatloads of money.
Sectors i dont pay much mind too for the most part for now, although, at the moment i am looking into semi conductors. If you can get TSM $120 calls under 4.00 for april, that would be golden. Look up some DD for them and its a solid play. My average is 3.63 at 3 contracts, i wont be adding more (since my account isnt too large at the moment)

Also look into what sectors are hot at the moment as well 

Also ive been trading for about 6 months now so there is still much i have to learn in the sense of what sectors and stuff there are and all or a good amount of stocks that are in them. I have noticed that after oil stocks shoot up and go on a run, shippers usually go after.

"Japan tried several fiscal policy measures to break out of its liquidity trap, but it is generally believed that these measures were not executed well—money was wasted on inefficient public works projects and given to failing businesses. Most economists agree that for fiscal stimulus policy to be effective, money must be allocated efficiently. In other words, let the market decide where to spend and invest by placing money directly in the hands of consumers. (For related reading, check out What Is Fiscal Policy?)"

Your premise is that I have done way worse that your 79% gain YTD.  Good for you on those returns — but it’s 100% false that I haven’t done better than that. And the year before, and the year before, and the five years before, and the tens year before, and the twenty years before.  Do whatever want. There’s are thousand of ways to make and lose money. But, are you lucky or are you good?  If you don’t know the difference, than just go draw charts with the moron named in my post and live a happy life. That’s all anyone is trying to do.

You know what's better than 600 dollars to placate the masses? How about not 600 dollars, and a free fucking market that doesn't inflate asset prices faster than you can catch up to them creating massive generation wealth inequality.   


If 600 dollars is enough to make the peons quiet down then money well spent by the boomers I guess.   
   
I'm still waiting for you or anyone to tell me why it makes any sense at all in a year when most people have actually made more money than they would have otherwise, and those that didn't got massive unemployment benefits. Rip the Band-Aid off, kill the zombie companies, burn out the overgrowth. Then instead of hoping you're one of the lucky ones to have an inheritance passed down, you could idunno, have a shot at assets at non manipulated/inflated prices?

Some people think its a pump and dump but based on the future opportunities growing in the dog market, it definitely struck me as a solid play. Everybody loves dog, and if the rise of pet insurance isn't enough to show people spoil and care for their dogs like children, idk what is.

I think you'll be okay, it's still relatively unknown. They need an announcement about their manufacturing contract before I jump in big. IDC if I pay in the 20+ range since this can easily go up to a 10b valuation.

Read the warrant agreement, it's an attachment to the S1/A: https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/0001811882/000119312520191638/d930055dex44.htm


In simple terms there's exercise and redemption - redemption can't happen until you're able to exercise.  

You can't exercise for 30 days after merger, or 1 year after PSTH was started, whichever is later - so if they merge 6 months after creation you have to wait 6 months for warrants to activate.  If it takes over 11 months then it's 30 days after merger.

There are two different structures spelled out in the redemption section with different thresholds, one is cashless at $20 (see warrant table for exchange rates of warrants to shares), the other is cash at $36 where you pay $23 to exercise 1 for 1.

Once the redemption is called you have 30 days to either sell or exercise your warrants or they give you a few cents each.

PLTR is the next PLTR, it just went public a few months ago and is very misunderstood by "average" and institutional investors. It still needs more profitability to explode, but once it does it's going to rocket 🚀.  

It's still a good price to get in, it will probably hold between $40-50 for the first half of 2021, but once it's clients continue to show increased efficiency/profits, it'll become a hot item for big $$$ corporations and world governments.

Hahah thanks bro
Someone give me some reassurance on AMD calls 😔
Bought 4400 shares of ICLN at like 16 bucks and 1400 shares of BLNK at 7.50ish. ICLN going to 100 would be absolutely fucking insane.
You are right on one thing, the dream is a complete joke and the only way to make it is to gamble on things like WSB.  However 600$ is a drop in the bucket an every dollar you give to the average public gets pumped right back into the economy.

Thought you were the same person because you replied on their behalf. Anyway my point to OP remains, we must factor premiums and decay in these calculations.

Original statement was inaccurate unless the expectation is for the options to jump ITM quickly after purchase.

It's all long term positioning. The key is the us house in 2022. Dems barely kept their majority. R need a weak economy and the house flips in 2022 because the incumbent party gets blamed for whatever happens between now and then. It positions them better for a 2024 run with a generic boring R (cotton, hawley etc) and a chance at all three houses for the first time since 2017
RC calling a proxy vote with his new law firm could do it.

Only dipshit Americans. Actual poor people who are out there starving to death right now are waiting for our shit to collapse so they can start ganking our shit instead of dying for us to gank theirs. American society treats me like shit for having enough of a moral compass to care more about those people which just makes me care even less about American dipshits and even more about those people. The few American people I know who are decent human beings are free to turn to me for help with survival if things get truly bad for them, my preparations are meant to let me secure the survival of more than just myself, but for the most part the world's rich people such as the US can get fucked for all their murder and thievery and other crimes against humanity and nature

IPOC
I'm 29, still can't wrap my head around why anyone who has been working this year needs a stimulus check. From what I can tell most people made more money this year, and anyone who didn't or lost a job had massive unemployment supplementation earlier in the year, and also are now getting like 11 more months x 300 which is pretty good.   


Juicing the economy at this point with needless stimulus for people like me who had a job all year will get taken back via inflation AND THEN SOME. All you're doing by pounding the table for stimulus is propping up boomer retirements until they die and leave you with an even bigger fucking bag that your dumb ass essentially begged for. The are shitting on younger generations and you guys are just fucking lapping it up like good little dogs.   


FUCK THAT. I would love if they would stop manipulating/propping up an economy so that people young enough would have a chance at actually affordable houses and stocks, but nope, you guys would rather try striking it rich on a gambling sub because subconsciously you know it's your only fucking shot at the American dream because the boomer financial engineering has royally fucked you out of a legit shot at wealth accumulation.  


But yeah, more stimulus please, that way when I eventually reach retirement age all the gains will have been milked dry by boomers and the dollar will have been so debased that any entitlements I get like social security will be paid out in worthless fucking fiat.   


Fuck you people dumb.

i don't have much because it was all boomer shit forever that barely grew & i didn't put much in until last few years. back then i was still paying like $10 to make a trade on shares so i didn't get into actively investing until semi recently, last couple years.
Right now — 10,000 shares of FST. Biggest gainers on the year were AMZN calls in January, SPY calls in Apr and shares of various EV SPACs in from October to present. Biggest loss also AMZN calls and NOK calls. 

FST is a fast food spac. While Fast food spac probably sounds retarded, it’s trading at basically NAV right now. Extremely experienced management team, and if you think COVID will be over in the near to mid term, this is probably a pretty good play for tendies with almost no risk. Look at OPES for an example of a restaurant Spac moving. (Currently BFI after merger). Trying to be more responsible now that I’ve fallen into tendies, but still love blowing my wad on weeklies as well.

BABA TO THE MOON!
Lancadia holdings II, holding company owned by Tilman Fertitta is merging with Tillman’s casino Golden Nugget to go public in the iGaming space. Golden Nugget is the only iGaming company that’s already profitable because of physical location and it’s already up n running, it’s the second public iGaming stock and besides draftkings there’s no other public iGaming company to invest in, also their CEO is richer than Mark Cuban and an amazing businessman who owns many companies like Landry’s restaurant group (bubba gump shrimp, mortons, etc) as well as a lot more, he’s always on CNBC everything he touches turns to gold. The merger goes through Tuesday and if you do your research you’ll see that it’s virtually guaranteed to merge, ticker will change soon too. It’s volume and buyers are ATH along with its stock price, up AH, and people are beginning to FOMO. I’m increasing my position Monday while I can. This is going to be big. Gambling at home is the future.
Incorrect. He sold a cash secured put. This means he already has the money to purchase the 100 shares at the selected strike price. If the buyer exercises, he'll be required to buy 100 shares at the strike price. He loses money here because the price of the stock is much lower than where he was forced to buy since he wrote the contract.

It isn't particularly better or worse than in any other community with established pecking order, so it doesn't bother me too much. I've been through dozens and dozens of Internet communities over the years and I know how people roll when they perceive themselves to be above the "plebs". I think it's just human nature, we kinda tend to be dicks to each other, especially under the veil of anonymity.

I'm no saint either, I sometimes bite when I should just bark, but nobody's perfect.

Best of luck to you too!
My friends just asked me if I there is a casino. literally do they know they are casinos in town
the BABA bagholding in this sub is going to wipe out a lot of people


for those that don’t know anything about Chinese politics or just power in general, gtfo of BABA while you still can. This isn’t a dip, this is a show of force to put all other Chinese entrepreneurs in check. Jack and his empire are done, XI will make sure of it.
As I stare at the bark box in front of me . And then stare at my stock accounts ...

Great job.... what are you doing.
Damn, now I gotta go to Twitter to know the whole story.
Damn, how much yoj got in your acc? I was wondering if people withdraw to have a little spending money for nice shit if they have a good ass green day
I just watched the big short. Good thing nothing like that is going to happen again.
It's an acquired taste lol but now I just crave it after a hot ass day. If I were to give up beer for liquor it'd be cause of the calories. Losing that beer gut is a bitch.
That’s the final straw I’m exiting my bear positions. That $358 pre market was the final straw. I mean what the fuck was even that?

Beyond meats..... wait 10 years. And retire.
ICLN or RIOT
Story this far. Started with 888. Bought 4 .96 calls for 384. Sold at 5.50 for a gain of 2200 or whatever.

888 + 2200 = 3088.

Withdrew 1000. 

Computer decides somehow that 384 is 5x the 10-bagger that never happened. RH is thrown off to believe that a multiple of 47 is there because of a withdrawal on a factor of less than 10. 

Kinky-fucking-lies. 

Tell me more.
So what's your story. How'd you get here?
GME for sure. But I also like the stic ticker and upcoming Barkbox play, which I jumped on today.
never unless taxes. last time i withdrew money to buy something was like 2014 and i bought 2 or 3 pounds of weed to sell.

when i buy a house ofc tho

I worked a part time job as a janitor in college, I was able to pay all of my room, board, tuition and still have money left for Friday nights."

Tickers? Positions?
Story time:

From the monday before thanksgiving to the Friday a week after I turned $1.3K into $10.3K. At that point I started to panic that I'd lose my money and despite continuing to identify killer stocks my trading became retarded dropping me to $5.5K. 

Still not sure just what to do, but if you're losing your mind like I was it could help to step away from the market for a week to clear your head (or wait a little longer to find the next big pick).

Edit: also if you're about to start with options definitely start small and study up on how they work.
It's an acquired taste lol but now I just crave it after a hot ass day. If I were to give up beer for liquor it'd be cause of the calories. Losing that beer gut is a bitch.

Absolutely you’re doing the right thing.a lot of those urgent cares are scams. They got the doctors who barely passed. Since my insurance allows us to do free FaceTime doctor calls, I just do those. Although I’m a healthy guy and would only go to an urgent care when I needed a sick note for work

SolarWinds is an interesting one. Had shares in them and pulled out the second I heard the news. 

Interesting part is that they were on a pretty consistent uptick before the breach, this could get good if we just wait for good news. Either it’ll go back to normal, or it could get pumped BIG time, and I feel like the latter is more likely.

Or they could like, never come back from this shit and they’ll die lol, but that’s unlikely.

Taxes figured into my decision to roll my ITM GME CCs. I took a low five figure loss on them to keep my unrealized share gains. The loss drops my 2020 taxes and deferring the share gains pushes them into 2021.

Still ended up sending the IRS $10K this week.

Ignore the taxman at your own peril.
OP what resources did you use? $4 to 100k sounds like a pretty good return.

It’s not quite that...

Most of them are arrogant beyond a reasonable point and just think they’re smarter than everyone else

They continually try to time “the big crash” to be contrarian and to attempt to be the last one standing holding all the cards while the “retards” are BTFO like some shitty remake of “the big short”. 

In reality, the world doesn’t work like that. They get absolutely blown the fuck out most of the time and they spend a lot of time sitting on the sidelines slinging mud and hate at the market and anyone making money off of shares and calls, refusing to accept that their own toxic mindset is holding them back.

They’re annoying. It’s not just you who feels that way.

outside risk of the shares running away from you and you watching from the sidelines 'waiting/hoping for a dip'
Thank you!
Appreciate the info there. Looking into this more and more tonight. The S1 is admittedly blurry still (sec actually sent PS the original filing back and told them to amend because it wasn’t clear at all).

So final question then, the warrants are not capped at $36. 

Based on my understanding, this thing has to be merged for 30 days before PS can call the redemption (which takes another 30 days). 

In other words if this merger happens and the stock goes to $75, I have to wait 30 days to buy the warrants at $23, at which place I can sell those shares at whatever the stock is 39 days post merger (50,75,100, whatever).

PS has to actually wait 60 days before they can functionally redeem anything right? Or am I wrong? 

Key here is the capped warrant structure. I’ve read the S1 twice and can’t settle on how this part actually works.

Cheers

The RSI is always between 0 and 100, with stocks above 70 considered overbought and stocks below 30 oversold. Divergence between the price and RSI can also be analyzed for potential reversals.

No, we want the market to fairly value things, including labor, buttfuck. When asshole bulls like you drive up energy/commodity prices and short bonds (driving up interest rates), then the economic recovery never happens, and wage earners suffer more. Also, your speculative booms drive up housing and other costs making it harder on wage earners, who are most of the population. Go fuck yourself with a splintery 2x4.

Good thoughts man. I suppose I should be a bit more charitable here given the time of year.

Why don’t we go buy Palantir and wait 3 years to make an extra ten$ a share 😂. Anyone who didn’t get in on the beginning with meme stocks like that won’t make squat. Dismantling BABA anytime soon would do irrevocable harm to Asian markets. You get in now your guaranteed to make some money. Whether it’s two months down the line or six. China wants foreign investment as much as any other country even if its on their terms. Dismantling BABA and telling everyone go fuck yourselfs makes no sense. China govt is evil not stupid. Anyway I am a biased autist as I bought around 45 shares for like 10,000$ today.

There are more short shares than the outstanding shares available for GME. Thus, people are buying to force the short sellers in to covering their position (this means buying the stock back since a short position is a borrowed position). This covering of stock will cause a short squeeze and extreme profits will be possible because of the amount of traders buying back the stock

1. Make gains. Let's say you turn $2500 into $10000. (hahaha)
2. $10k-$2500=$7500 gain.
3. Set aside like 25% of that gain if you want to be conservative. So in this case $1875 goes into cash and doesn't get touched.
4. Reinvest the rest or spend it on chimkin nuggies idc.
5. You'll get something in the mail from your broker (Robinhood or w/e you use) called a 1099 in February, maybe March. If you threw it away you can download another copy from them.
6. Whenever you do your taxes you check the box or whatever for "capital gains". Use the 1099 to fill it out.
7. Whatever taxes you owe on the gains are subtracted from your withholding (if you're lucky enough to have a job). If the taxes are bigger, then you owe money. Use what you didn't spend on chimkin to pay the spooks. Or pull a Wesley Snipes and don't pay. I'm not a lawyer.

As I frequently withdraw from Robinhood you're lying. And even if you weren't this is inaccurate mathematically. 🙄
If it isn’t PLTR related then no!
All good stuff. But whatever you said about research and reading 10-k is b.s. There are people who do this for a living. If we are trading based on all what you said; the market has already priced the stock with the news and the 10-k. 

Basically TLDR you are saying “Better buy an index fund “ 😴

I’m long BABA, I bought them shorty after IPO.  Strong fundamentals and I’ve been using their services even before IPO. I have private label business, selling on Amazon.  

However I’m bearish right now. I’m not selling my shares ( in my retirement account) but I wouldn’t recommend anyone YOLO on options. This shit stuff is far from over. 

You will have much bigger chance to be rich by buying any SPAC in hot sector that hasn’t been mooning. 

People thought it’s just like Google / Apple/FB anti trust shit. Chinese government is nothing like US gov.  If they want you to be in prison, you’ll go to prison. If they want to disappear, you’ll disappear. It’s no joke. Jack Ma needs to suck dick and shut up.

> However it is far from perfect, because the weights/thresholds that the algorithm uses seem to stop working for lower priced stocks. (For example the algo has trouble with tickers like GE). More work is needed to generalize to algorithm to handle a broad range of tickers.

Haven't looked at the code yet, but could that be mitigated by normalizing the stock price internally?

Can you translate for us retards? What do all your pictures mean? And all the symbols underneath.
I imagine being a Perma-Bear is hoping for the downfall of society .  You want things to get worse for other investors, regular average people, working people trying to make ends meat.  You want people you know to financially suffer and you hope to profit off of that suffering.  I can't imagine living my life like this, wanting catastrophic bad things to happen to people for my own selfish gain.
I wink my warm butthole on onlyfans a few times a week and old pervs send me hundreds of dollars

Can someone less retarded than me explain the percentage of ETF in the ARK daily emails? For example, look at Google for today. Cathie bought .2681 of google for ARKG. There is no way that’s 26 percent of the fund, is it? And there’s also no way it’s only a quarter of a single percent...unless it is..
Nice gains bro. Mostly Options or Stocks?

Age is a factor. I've been terribly naive in my younger years, even now in my 30s, I let myself get hyped up way too much about some stuff, but I do recognize when this is happening and can at least be aware that I'm not being rational, rather emotional. 20-25 year old me would have no clue that I was being driven purely by delusion and other people's schemes a lot of times...

I've counted enough years already to recognize a phony when I see one, and Cramer is a textbook example. A crony with a rather mediocre poker game though, he gets all cutsy and shit, but he doesn't hide his hand very well at all.

Investing in things that are "good" or civically responsible   is great and all if you believe in the company and/or are worried about having "ill gotten gains", but this is all being traded on the secondary market so you're not financing the company directly. 

If you were buying their products or their corporate bonds I get it, you're helping the company, or if youre some pre ipo investor, but otherwise i think its just gambling with extra steps. I agree that it's ridiculous.

Steel is in very high demand and there’s isn’t enough supply. Feb 11 is the next earnings and will boost their stock prices up.
You’re right, but it’d work more often than not. And even if you did get assigned you make money on that too. 

VOO, a pretty boring ETF, is $339 a share. $1,500,000 gets you a little over 4400 shares. 1/15 $355 calls are 40¢, so if you sold 44 contracts that’s $17,600. 

That’s not an impressive percentage, but for playing life on easy mode it’d be hard to beat.

SPACs still give an advantage to companies, they can negotiate how much they want to go public for like a normal IPO. With direct listing they face risk of being undervalued.

How’s Monday looking boys
Bingo! Selling contracts is the WAY to go with high IV. High IV means high premiums, and selling contracts means you’re on the delicious side of that. Just make sure you’re totally comfortable with owning those shares at the strike price if you get exercised!

Once you own those shares, well.... looks like now you can start selling covered calls! If you google “the wheel strategy”, I think you’ll find this strategy to be quite lucrative.

I’m actually 25% Mexican 👍🏻 but mostly German and Irish.
SFIX was a 1.5 bagger for me over the last 8 weeks (I just buy shares like a boomer).

Dumped 85% of my shares after reading your DD, though.

I'm a little leery about buying puts because I think the perception that this is a magic escalator might take a quarter or two to dissipate.

But I wouldn't be surprised to see a major pullback based on how radically it's risen.

This is why I buy and sell shares like a boomer. I don't need the difficulty modifier of time constraints.

Hope your play works out, though! Solid thesis. Just might need more time to execute imo...
You have 35k, what stock do you yolo into and sell CCs on 2021?
It’s Christmas Eve, what are you doing here nerds?
The stocks seems like a fine pick but the exposure rocketing it up to 19.50 over the course of a day was a fast pump so it dumped to 17 and is back to 18 on a relatively low volume day. I wouldn’t be surprised if it has another dump next Monday.

I exited my position with a trailing stop at 19 and I considered re-entering at 17. I’ll watch it for future plays but for now I’m not convinced I wouldn’t rather park my cash elsewhere.

But the housing market is supposedly on fire, will continue in 2021, and RKT is the leader in that industry.
Float % is not what you should be looking at. 136% is based on what people consider the float size to be. No one really knows what the float is, some say 144% others 300%. Just look at the amount of shares shorted, which is current at 68.15M.

Heyyy this is legit I'm working on something similar but I'm using the spy as a gauge of when to buy SPXL and SPXS respectively...it's still WIP though. I was also thinking of using the QQQ as a gauge and trading TQQQ and SQQQ. I'll probably use your code to get some ideas if you don't mind.

Russell Top 50 index is outperforming Russell Top 1000 index & S&P 500 index. Even Russell Top 1000 is outperforming S&P 500 index. So small businesses did a lot better this year and will do a lot better next year compared to big (tech, banks etc...) companies.

Feliz Navidad Pendejos
This is not what quants do.
I am kinda bad at the object-oriented part of Python, how exactly is the first and second derivative calculated?
Means no keeping shitposts to a maximum
1. Literally you cannot buy/sell for 5 minutes or set amount of time (sometimes due to big announcement. Look at the day they announced the microsoft deal). This happens when there are absolute batshit crazy amount of short covering or selling. Look at Kodak, multiple trading halts one after another.
2. It's possible because hedge fund shorts literally thought Covid lockdown will bankrupt gamestop but they didn't do their homework and fell aslept at the wheel.
3. You absolutely will. Unlike people playing options won't get as much but given how shorted the stock is you will most likely still 4-5x over time at least without the worry of timing when the squeeze will happen. Anyone telling you when it will finally squeeze is just guessing at this point. Buy shares and forget about it for 2 years.
I wouldn’t be surprised if rkt never sees 30 again
Pandemica took my life away 😭
Ill settle for 35$
Fuck, retards here will get tricked by anything.  

Ay morons, use the charting shit that comes with your broker if you want to use tEcHnIcaL ANALasys. Don't trust random posts that give no period of the backtest, don't provide ratios like maximum drawdown, upside to downside, sortino/sharpe etc. How does this perform compared to holding QQQ or whatever nasdaq ETF? I don't even need to test it to know it did worse.

However I will say it is probably posted with good intentions.
They should somehow allow markets to be open 24/7 on RH like cryp

Does make you more aggressive in reaching goals, gives you alpha mentality
It's the other way around. Tech stocks have become too overpriced so money is rotating into small caps now.  Because of QE and stimulus, the dollar has been getting killed, so people are just rotating money around looking for a safe haven that still has some juice left to squeeze.

Compare QQQ and IWM since the crash. QQQ went gangbusters until Sept. and has slowed down since. IWM was fairly muted in the recovery, but has taken the lead since the end of Sept.

If you're bringing up Fastly, they're the perfect example of not doing theta gang. Stock was at 25 pre-corona, stayed in the 20s the next 2 months mostly. But then it \~5xed on the way up.

If you had bought Fastly at 25 but listened to theta gang on the way up, then the calls you sell will always get assigned and it would never be a very profitable strategy.

As for right now? Sure, maybe right now covered calls on Fastly look like a good idea. But they also looked like a good idea in June, and if you'd done that, it could have been ugly.
Cmon mods, ban this shit out of here.

Only problem is printing to much will cause your money to be so worthless that you will have to cash out your entire portfolio to get some BBQ sauce. Wtf are tendies good for with no sauce. 
First stimulus package is forecasted to cost each middle class American about 75k in long run do to inflation. But yea let just print ourselves all the way to fucking Venezuela. Oh and where did the money in these printing frenzies go/ going to go?? 
-Fucking gender programs in Pakistan, 
-Fucking black cards for politicians. (Why the fuck some are given government credit cards is just beyond my knowledge anyway but there is a very long list of misuse) 
-Oh and lets not forget the food stamps we are still paying out to dead people. Maybe pull from that to budget out a stimulus package? Nnnnaaaaaaaaaa. Why put in the extra effort when we can just print more money easier.   I could go on. 

 Just for clarification I’m not opposing a stimulus package. I know a lot of good can come from it. But you retarded fuckers who are ok with the people who need it getting less then 25% while the bulk goes to god only know what are beyond fucking retarded. And not the good WSB kind. The “we feed you Mac and cheese so you don’t choke” kind. No tendies

Lol, the fact that I have to argue with retards on this sub, and explain why a higher price for steel would increase the price of a steel stock is sad....Look at oil companies in the U.S for example. If OPEC cuts thier production (less supply), the price of oil increases. Making U.S. production more profitable ,which increases thier share price. Is opec decreasing thier production permanent? No!, they could increase it tomorrow. Does the demand for oil change because opec cut production? Not really either, people still drive the same amount more or less....... In this examlple though, let’s say OPEC is going as fast as it can, but can’t make enough oil, people are ordering oil 6 months in advance, the prices start and keep climbing, and It’s though it might be months before they catch up. And let’s say you own a company that produces Oil, sure, its no OPEC, but it’s going to be worth alot of money in this scenario.

Nah dude, the MOASS is still, like, a 5% likely to happen kind of event. Too many variables and uncertainty at play for this thing to reach boiling point that easily. A month ago, when I first invested in GME, the whole uber-squeeze scenario did not make sense to me right away, and I knew legit nothing about nothing then, and I know nothing about very few things right now. The big players like Melvin Capital and BofA do not just let themselves get fucked over easily like that, they've got loads of ways, connections and ammo to bid their time and exit at breakeven or even minor profit.

I mean, I'd be livid af if this thing moons to $420.69, but cautious optimism is best approach I think.

What is quite likely, is this TSLA scenario, where we slowly burn up and up for weeks and months next year, as long as a constant stream of new positive catalysts hits the news every few days and the overall sentiment keeps slowly, but surely shifting from "HAR HAR Blockbuster bankruptcy" to "well I'll be damned, they're actually turning this around..."

Then, we might hit those $60+ price targets, which, even now, for most people would be a 3x at least, and I'd be willing to bet a few bucks that's more than 90% of WSB gamblers make over the course of the year
Oh and trading halts means you cannot buy or sell. Prevents and absurd change from mass hype

Every generation, there’s a massive market bubble that traps retail investors into thinking it’s the easiest thing in the world to double your money, and then on the way down, everyone gets completely wiped out, leaves the market, and misses out on the actual 10-year bull run after. By 2021 EOY, we will have completed this generation’s cycle.

i don't see how that one is a pump and dump play when GME was like right at a billion right before he yeeted in along with a lot of the WSB whales. WSB isn't really moving GME even though supposedly we own 7% of the float
But if youre lucky and gamble and get 2000% you need lose 95% to return to the squalor from whence you came.

We are weak. We deserve this
IWM and small caps are also in a bubble imo. IWM is up 25% on the year with the worst earnings outlook for 2021. I understand the recovery trade but that’s fucking priced in dawg besides maybe a couple names. Since small caps, cloud/security/gaming/ecommerce, EV/solar, mid cap tech are all “overvalued” there’s only two safe havens in the market to throw money in and get a guaranteed return.... mega cap blue chip tech and SPACs. FAANG and SPACs might as well be the new bonds for 2021. How retarded?

Buying from other retailers feels good and they’re so thankful for your service. Even send you thank you cards and shit lol
There is no "set" price for a stock. Buyers place bids, and sellers place asks and whatever matches becomes the latest price. When people short, not only does it increase the number of sellers, they're motivated to sell so they're likely to move their ask price down to the bid. So the bids will just keep getting lower and lower, and the asks will have to come down if they want to sell. 

This is why it's a good idea to look at the bid and ask spread when buying things, and why volume and open interest is important.

It'll be a snowball effect and what seems like a bit of bad news one day will cause it all to crash rapidly.

19 year old guy starts investing big time this year in renewable stuff, obviously makes money in this cocaine fueled market and boasts about it on reddit, meanwhile giving people shit for investing in companies like Exxon because ''they are unethical and he considers the ethics of a company alot'' but is invested in Tesla and motherfucking Disney himself. And weed of course. Gets over 4000 upvotes and a shit ton of these retarded emblems. In my opinion ridiculous.

I agree. Remember “STONKS NEVER GO DOWN”
This, the more time this goes sideways, the more they have to do some weird spreads and shit to manipulate their way out of a loss and actually turn profitable before years end.

Shorting a stock is essentially borrowing shares you don’t have to sell at market price, which forces the price of the stock down because the market orders are now fulfilled. Then, the short seller buys the shares at the lower stock price and returns them to the brokerage they borrowed them from.
[removed]
It doesn't. In fact, if you just bought shares in the 15 most short stocks on a rotating basis, let's say monthly or semi-annually, you would outperform the market.

Yes. It's a total fraud. If someone didn't know that before the Hindenburg report, fine. It seemed pretty obvious to me a year ago that this company was a total fraud, but whatever.

But if you held the stock after Hindenburg, then you deserve to lose. It was a big sign in neon lights that said "SELL NOW". Anyone who was too stupid to sell is too stupid to have money.

One word - Panic. Just remember shorters sell stock they dont own thinking it will go down and they will return the stock by purchasing at a lower price. They borrow and sell stock of a company they feel is under pressure. If correct, they get to purchase it cheap and return the value keeping the difference.If wrong they lose their pants.

OP thinks stimulus is still coming. No one tell him.
That was my immediate thought after I saw this newfound fascination for the old fart. Cramer's a dude with an interest and an agenda, everything that kind of dude does is calculated and serves some kind of purpose of his.
Im sure if the democrats had left Lesbian Dance Theory advancement in Pakistan out of the bill it would've had a better chance of getting signed.
> Imagine, the items are accurately described, it arrives in 1 hour via Doordash/Uber eats and there is no fuss no muss. 

I think this particular point is really worth expanding on because it's potentially game changing. This is why I think think all the negativity about DASH is extremely short sighted. The same people who are super bullish on GME often tend to be extremely negative about DASH, which makes little sense. DASH is absolutely moving toward expanding well beyond food delivery. They've already signed contracts with places like CVS and WalMart, and they're working on Walgreens right now. There's already DoorDash drivers delivering flat screen TVs right now.

If if anything is going to compete with Amazon, it will be with something like this. Think about it. You order whatever random electronics you need from GME, and literally 15 minutes later it's at your door after being dropped off by a DoorDash driver. Unless you live in the middle of a major city and within a few miles of the Prime Now warehouse, AND you pay a huge extra fee for under 1 hour delivery, you are not going to be able to get anything from Amazon delivered to your door that fast. Plus, Prime Now's selection is pretty limited and you aren't always going to be able to find many kinds of electronics on it.

Amazon's entire edge comes from their economy of scale and using major distribution centers to deliver you batteries for your dildo in 2 days or less. This is an excellent model for dramatically speeding up delivery times for online orders to within a couple days, but it *does not work* for deliveries within an hour. Amazon's model cannot be cost effectively scaled up to improve delivery times much more than they already have it. Amazon has already even tried to do this with Prime Now, and it's failing. Amazon trialed doing restaurant delivery like DoorDash for 2 years and  eventually gave up on it.

You know who \*does\* have less than 1 hour deliveries figured out? DASH. DoorDash already operates in most parts of the country and is very quickly starting up operations in even rural areas. They have a massive workforce of drivers all over the country, and they've rapidly gone from 20% marketshare to over 50% in the restaurant delivery business so far this year. Their gig economy model is perfectly suited to operating without any form of centralization around warehouses and instead takes advantage of existing brick and mortar restaurants and retail outlets.

If OP's vision of GME ends up playing out, GME partnering with DASH or UBER would be as close as anyone could possibly get to being a legitimate threat to Amazon.

The main advantage that brick and mortar retail has these days is the fact that you can get something instantly by walking into a store and not have to wait for it to arrive in the mail. Amazon's main advantage is the convenience. It's often worth waiting a day or two for something to arrive when it's so absurdly easy to just press a couple buttons on your beep boop machine and it's on the way. Now imagine if you could take that convenience of being able to sit on the couch in your underwear while you order those dildo batteries, and combine it with the instant gratification of having it in your hands just minutes later? 

Hell, in a model where a store like GME partners with gig delivery like DASH and UBER, in most cases you could actually receive your items \*faster\* than if you literally drove to the store and got it yourself. DoorDash and Uber drivers are usually lurking all over the area waiting for the next delivery ping. Unless you live literally next door to a Gamestop, odds are there will be a driver closer to the store than where you even live. When you place your order, they will get pinged to head to the store, and in the couple minutes it takes them to drive there, a GME employee will grab your items off the shelf and have them ready to go when the driver gets there.

There are dramatically more GME stores across the country than there are Amazon warehouses, so even with the closure of poor performing locations, for the vast majority of consumers, this model would hands down be the absolute fastest possible way one could purchase and receive consumer electronics.

This is an oxymoron. Sales tax places the burden disproportionately on the poor, who must spend a greater percentage of their income on basic needs.

Wait I think it's more like if there are more buyers than sellers -> stock goes up. If there are more sellers than buyers -> stock goes down. 

Shorting is just another way to "sell", as in its selling without owning the stock, so it adds to the sell pressure overall. Of course since they don't own the stock, if they are wrong, they have to quickly buy back (cover) adding to the buyers side, causing these short squeezes.
Think all the short squeeze people should’ve left by now during the dip to 20.00 support and the people that are in are those that believe in the earnings and cohen takeover 🚀🚀🚀

$MT calls should have always been March - June.  Very risky before their earnings call in Feb.  I would expect MT to remain mostly flat through January before we start to see the rise.

Everyone on this sub is using them interchangeably. I gave up and joined them

This time it's different
Twitter abandoned him but we have not. Cramer, come here where you’re appreciated (mostly).
We streamed it this year. Cracking a few cold ones watching a church service was a new experience.
You should've repeated the be patient line more times lol.Dropped half of my shares two weeks ago, during the SPAC hard days, when it came back to the 11s and moved to BFT.

Still happy with BFT but THCB hasn't yet dropped a DA and this may drive the stock back to the ground.

Even worse, the SPAC bubble may pop with QS and we could possibly see everything crashing.

Do you think this is still a hold if DA doesn't drop by the first two weeks of Q1?
Good Americans play options on American companies

People keep repeating the price target of 30 because that's what it around trade roughly based on its valuation. Its a great company with a solid team. This stock will pick up. However id advise against options since who knows what the timing is

Magna has too many players in the game, where else could they go for quality manufacturing without giving up a ton of company control.

Example being magna owns 6-9% of fisker for example
The people who really made bank today had them yesterday at 40 points above where it finished when the stock was up and IV was low. Someone who decided to load up on OTM puts then is rich now

The naïveté on display here about Cramer is just incredible. Dude doesn’t give a flying fuck about anyone here unless he can con you into his media ecosystem (and judging by some of these comments, he’s doing a pretty good job). Christ almighty everyone, get a grip.
Have your mom go get a good financial advisor. Do not mix family and money. Upside is not worth the downside risk.
Why is it that when amd moves nvda moves in alignment together

I really do hope our lord Ryan Cohen has something better planned.
The analogy would work if there weren't nearly 50 manufacturers in the 1920s. But I don't disagree with what you're saying.
That's a good point. A lot of people think GME is a shit business with a customer base that hates them. Which is kinda true. I'm all about the short squeeze+PS5 sales. I am short-medium term hold on this but not long.
It’s going parabolic
i had over 3 weeks to expiration, but I felt like it was gonna have a 10% dip coming up and trade sideways. 

ugh sold for like a 25% gain when I could've 5x'ed (and even more potentially).

Well, a neural net by itself is sort of a primitive form of an A.I., but in this case he actually doesn't have a neural net. He just created some equations to run price history through, and ran old data through to check how the equations worked, and they worked reasonably well for him. This is not a foolproof method going forward (nor is anything, of course!)

But yeah hold on to it imo. The share price doesn't match the valuation and the actual company is good. I'm like you, have shares at $12. I want at least 24 but is should hit 30. Might take some time though.

For people who have calls though yeah idk

DO NOT DO THIS
The more money you have the more you’re willing to lose. Obviously I was pissed I lost $500 on the bb calls but it wasn’t that big of deal. I remember back when I first started with a couple grand, losing $500 was hard because it was such a large amount in comparison to my balance. Now I can take those risks more comfortably. When I hit 100k I’ll be more comfortable with 5k risks and so on.
Pussy
How dare you diss our lord and savior Jimmy 2 Crames like that. Didn't you know he works so hard to make us all money and "for free!" 

Accept our sincerest apologies lord Cramer, this fool will be circumcised from here very shortly.
Yes if you hold through the merger
I have many different things working for me in different ways. 

On example, Gilead has been is almost perfectly oppositely correlated to the market this year.  At $57 with a 4.77% dividend yield, GILD is a good bet for a double digit total return in 2021 and beyond. My thesis is that it is super cheap right now due to end of year tax loss harvesting and hedge funds and this riding the wave down, making selling worse. It’s a tremendous company. 

Make market agnostic bets. This is more much complicated. One example, Fitbit (FIT) trades on the likelihood of Google completing its acquisition. When the deal closes (likely in my view) the stock will trade up to the take out price and you’ll get cash. Don’t be stupid. Some deals are very very risky. Only invest in what you understand. There’s always risk.  You just have to decide — is it risk that you can sleep with? Don’t do anything without really understanding this question. 

Take your time. There’s no hurry. The trade will 95% still be there tomorrow or will come around again.

Do the work. Me, a stock broker, your brother’s friend, and zillions of people on the Internet have stock picks ideas. We aren’t responsible for your decisions — and not everyone knows what they are talking about. In fact most don’t. Any idiot can buy PLTR because it’s trending on WSBs. Do they really understand how governments buy their software, how they can grow, and how defensible their technology is?  Most people have no idea. You have to do research and read a lot. There’s no substitute for hard work. If you don’t have the time and inclination to do research, that’s 100% okay too. Just buy an index and live your life. Don’t gamble on stocks you aren’t interested in learning about. Sometimes you will lose money, sometimes you will make money.   Even Amazon was down more than 80% at one point. All you can do is move forward. The market doesn’t care about your cost basis. Just try to make smart, reasoned decisions and you’ll be fine. And no matter what you do, I hope you and everyone lives a happy and prosperous life!
When is PLTR gonna take off for real?

I feel like I'm holding this meme garbage and it's weighing me down like a very heavy bag of shit.
No
I'm super wary of investing in "this thing might happen in 5 years".

Because yes, it might. But then again it might not. However GME does have a unique set of positives. For the immediate future they have the top of a console cycle. You can buy just based on that. If the other stuff is going to come to pass it will be clear enough by the time this current console cycle is losing its initial steam.

In short you can buy and hold for at least a year. It's just a nonstop string of positive catalysts between here and the Q4 2021 (reported in 2022) comps (which may not be great depending on how things go).

Yup. Options trading is almost like a short term high. It’s not sustainable in the long haul. A couple years ago, I sold all my shares to trade options and lost it all. I’m now just sticking to buying shares, and my gains are more steady and consistent than ever.
I do it for my mom but not a chance in fucking hell am I going this year
3300 calls were only 7.0
I'm still on Steam myself, Epic is only for Fortnite which I haven't played in over a year now.

But, Steam doesn't have a particular monopoly on this market other than a tiny bit of brand loyalty, as most PC gamers, including myself, associate online PC game downloads with it. Origin to lesser extent, and Epic to a bit greater extent, have both proven Steam is vulnerable to losing this market share though.

With 7 billion in revenue and a lot of trimmed fat (1000 store closures) and an extra cash from console sales, it would be totally viable for GME to divert a couple million bucks into a side project that can compete with these platforms. It's really not even that technically demanding, you're just hosting a glorified online marketplace, I can find you 10 Indian programmers who can do a stellar job at that for $150,000 tops.

Maybe so. Except for the fact that Cramer isn’t actually reading any of this - he just mentions WSB because he sees some fresh blood interested in stocks that he figures he can flatter into watching his dumbfuck teevee show. We all need to get a bit more cynical about how guys like Cramer play the game.

It gets complex when it comes to the stock trading at or above $36 for 20 of 30 days. Management can redeem the warrants in that case but has to give notice, etc. You must be vigilant and informed. Read up...

I have a similar question.  ie. how can they just show up in your holdings if you don't have the appropriate amount of money in your account? Is there a pop-up message that asks if you would like to buy?

China “re-educated” their autists.
Perfect representation of people buying BABA calls
I think Nikola - great company, very future looking. For some unknown reason quite cheap at the moment. Scaling up their manufacturing capacities very rapidly and quite probably will increase revenues at least 100% next year.
Yahoo had an article on Monday which is how I found out about it. Yesterday CNBC did a piece in it. But  this site definitely helps.
I'm out and about and can't answer everything, but yes, you have a floor. The SPAC itself incurs very minimal expenses during it's existence relative to it's assets (shareholder $ equity aka Net Asset Value or NAV).

If the deal falls through, and the SPAC fails to execute a deal prior to their expiration date (typically 2 years from date of inception), the aim would be to have been bought in as close as possible to NAV. Basically your investment is secured against your own cash if you bought at NAV and they don't get too silly with DD expenses.
Not too concerned but a 🎅 rally would be nice to cap off this disastrous year. Not for markets but just for people in general

Shit is going to zero. It's a house of cards. Once Anheuser Busch cancels their order for 800 trucks, there will be basically nothing left for Nikola, since they aren't going to get the energy deal they desperately need (why would a utility extend a special price to a company that is so obviously lying about it's capabilities?).

Why, what’s happening Monday?
I said the same thing to u/ahminus earlier in one of the comment chains on a different thread, about the similarities to TSLA's short squeeze, which wasn't violent or fast, but took weeks, months to unravel.

With the setup we have, a slow gradual decrease of short interest, which has already been happening lately, followed by a slow gradual increase in price seems like the most likely way this short squeeze is going to effectively play out. That would also make it much less violent, and the price probably can't go super-parabolic, but it will definitely help push it a bit higher than it would be without this massive short accumulation.
Both

i see that makes sense - so has that historically worked well for u? Or are there times high volumes were followed by a downward share movement? I would think high volume can be selling too, right? In that scenario, the stock might sink.

so this is my first time investing in a SPAC. When does the stock usually take off with the most momentum? Is it when the merger is announced? When the merger is executed? Is there still a chance that the merger could fall through or not get voted through and sink the share price? If it were to fail to get approved, wouldn't the share price sink? In that scenario, you would be wrong in saying "you have a floor for your investment as it's a cash secured investment"

Thank you!!! This has helped ME! I for one appreciate the altruism. I have $866k in brokerage started w $425k in March. Not all is invested (dry powder per ur pt 5) so my returns are actually better than it appears. Scared af of options. Other degens don’t give me shit about my ROI. 130% return ($300->$700) is fine w me. If I can take my $860 and turn it into $2MM next yr (130%) I’ll be 😂😂😂 Trying to learn here. Thank you again.
Fucking hope it pops to there soon
Very nice bro! I’m not doing options currently, shares only. Starting out with $150 and hoping to get principal to $1500 in a few months then really start cracking out trades. I figure if I can make 10% a month on a different trade each month I could be a millionaire in 5 years.

They had an Nvidia chip to do AI. They found it insufficient. They built their own AI chip -- considered one of the best in the world. 

And FSD is already starting. Apple even has it in process for their new car. 118 miles without a driver intervention. But you have your Fox "News" channel which tells you that it's all a lie and gubermint bad.

I know MJ is, but I'm surprised no current active NBA player is like a billionaire (I think LBJ at 500 million is the most). Given the enormous contracts and shoe deals, it means they must not be great at investing since a lot of popular stocks returned like 5-10x in the last 5 years alone, and most have been playing for longer than that (some stocks like TSLA, AMD, and NVDA returned even more than that). Or it's more likely they just spend it at strip clubs and NDAs.
How long that take you bud? 12 years? 😂😂😂

Find stock with IV > 100, around $10-20, and then sell ITM puts or get 100 shares of stock and sell a call OTM. It’s so damned easy.
Lol $4100 times 70 = you missed out on $280k but no way you would of held that long lol still hurts.... I been grumpy all day .....bahumbug

Sure man, by all means, continue to believe it’s definitely not stripe and pass up on this play. If everyone were to write off stripe as a possibility it might push the price lower for me to accumulate more shares

In 2016 Tesla said its cars would have hardware on board with Full Self-Driving Capability, dumbass. 

The "Full Self Driving" you are talking about didn't even exist at the time!

The chip to do FSD, according to Musk, didn't exist until 2019/2020. In what universe was he not lying in 2016? 

Why would you think you get to make money off me? I am not buying their shitty stock, not buying their shitty cars, and there is really absolutely nothing I would ever want to buy from them. 

I have watched the latest investor video in which they discussed the capabilities of their chip, which is why I know it will never work. If this world consisted of intelligent people, they would have instantly dropped the stock like a rock, but it's full of uninformed idiots like you. 

It wouldn't surprise me if Tesla was being supported by government money (since it has been since its inception). In a real market economy, Tesla would have been bankrupt seven years ago. In this fantasy land where a shitty car company gets huge government loans, where the SEC doesn't lock up people when they break the rules, anything is possible.
Neural net is “automated teaching” compared to this where he’s manual teaching the ai, if I understand correctly.

You set up a Roth IRA. (USA).

You can set a beneficiary (obviously the wife's BF) - no tax.

If AMD sky rockets after I sold my calls I’m going to put su bae on time out
Hi are you me
You do realize if you’d invested a million in same stocks you’d have gained 715k 🤷🏻‍♂️
Baba is on like a 3x dip.  The US Chinese companies ban, speedbump on the ANT IPO, and then the anti-monopoly audit.  Damn dude, this ticker is cursed, watch the upcoming recession bring this to a 4x dip.

I think Baba has excellent financials (amount of debt they have vs asset values for example), so it will go back up eventually assuming they can manuever all the politics

They can't simply just replace CEOs like underwear anyway, this will 100% tank the stocks because it went from China state company stocks to CCP company stocks, who the fuck invests in companies that would put country interest first and company second? Hell, who the fuck would invest in commies? That's like a cockroach investing in pesticides.
MCAC is a SPAQ that is merging with Playboy just buy that retard
Idk why I went so hard on dailies today but I blew through 300 on GME and PLTR today lmao
Are options taxed the same as shares? I discovered y’all in November and have done a bit of options trading since and have never done taxes for them? (I’ve just bought and sold, haven’t executed any options)

imagine they value the IPO at 3x the price when it hits the market.
Yeah toned down comment in the name of goodwill for fellow man during holidays but exactly right.

I lost $250 on Baba! Fucking China!
Yeah, I feel like most of the people reading the original tweet didn’t understand the subtext.

Just a heads up, don’t be an absolute fucking retard like me dude. Be VERY FUCKING CAREFUL WITH OPTIONS. I originally had 10k in my portfolio, got it up 150% to 25k in 6 months with trading shares. In TWO WEEKS, I LOST EVERYTHING FROM TRADING OPTIONS. I have only $1500 now, and hate myself every fucking day for it. Do not be like me and be super careful or you just might lose everything....
Buy $BABA and Marry Christmas retards
Positions or ban
Baba bruh. They axed it in India.
Would I? No

Should you? Do you need the money? That’s what $600 or so after taxes?

How much did you make today from stonks
$20 is the clear support here, downward momentum got rejected hard today at that price, multiple times, just like the upward momentum got rejected at 22 yesterday, also multiple times. Sideways movement seems most likely for the next week, unless Daddy Cohen graces us with another "over 9000" 13D meme. Or maybe we get that retarded $2,000 stimmy. Maybe there are more catalysts, but these are most likely.

Bearish sentiment is slowly waning, and their hit pieces like that Motley Tool article earlier today and that retarded Shilling Alpha short thesis yesterday are borderline self-parody at this point.

A lot of non-WSB investing community is already woke on GME bull thesis, sounding off in the comments of afforementioned articles. Twitter is frenzied about GME too, following Hedgeye's bullish $50 target. Word is out and spreading fast.

With all this in mind, my fully amateur, incompetent, retard prediction is more of the same - opening hour bullishness resulting in big initial price spike/gap up, followed by meek/slow mid-day movement and small dips and rallies by the end of the day for the overall sideways trading pattern. We've rallied hard and fast this week, stonk has to cooldown a bit.

Lowest point is probably $19

Highest is 23, because 22 wall is very strong and thick and there's another one at 24 behind it. A lot of long buys happened during the September q2 earnings dip into the $6 range, a lot of those longs will be exiting at 4x for sure.

Diamond hands baby, this is now an almost guaranteed 2x and a very likely 3-5x, some time in 2021.

Good luck to all.
I am currently homeless with -16 dollars to my name. Let's see if I can pull it off.

Great work, which I truly appreciate.

When I saw RC’s letter to the board released publicly before earnings, and you look at the timing, it is clear RC has this all planned out. He gave the board enough time to react. They did react, but only just enough. RC won the initiative roll. Now RC bought a bigger stake at $16/share. Sherman will spend Christmas and New Years crafting the January earnings report with that on his mind. RC calls the tune, and Sherman is dancing like an overweight, sweaty white Boomer at a Bee Gees tribute concert.

I believe RC is in no hurry. Time is on his side. Shareholders are on his side. He has big dick energy and the capital to finish what he started. 

I’m in for 15K shares and will not write any more CCs against my position. I think it is foolish to time this to the day or week. RC is executing his plan and we are welcome to ride along. Don’t be a Sherman and react to a single event.

BABA briefly went negative YTD today (it's now up 2% YTD end of day today). Very few tech stocks this year are -YTD. Only ones I can think of are Intel and Cisco, but those 2 literally have no growth. All other big tech Chinese stocks (JD, BIDU, Tencent, NTES, BILI, PDD, etc.) are all up a lot, despite the narrative so BABA has been a huge exception, not the norm. Hope it rebounds.

When 3 hours go by without a mention of baba you buy calls and make it babasito
It’s kind of like this- Calls are what you do if you want to make zillions of dollars, puts are what you do if you want to lose all your money. Choose wisely.

Walgreen's had a big ass sign on front door when I went in today that said sorry we don't have the vaccine yet.  General public lol.
The issue to me is playing single contracts. If you play with multiples you can pull some profit and let winners ride. 2 contracts, set 1 for GTC sell order at 100% profit let the other ride, 3 contracts set 2 for GTC Sell order and let the other ride, etc can be done and messed around with depending on your exit strategy and # of contracts. Playing 1 contract really limits your plays and pressures you to paper hand winners.
They probably will and you knew that when you bought em you masochist

I know we're made to believe from all the gain porns that hopping from stock to stock as it gets hot is the way to make big money but the truth is, it doesn't work for the majority of people.

Has it worked for you?

If not, and you want something with HIGH HIGH probability of getting HOT HOT, this is definitely it.

How long of a wait? A few weeks at the most. A couple of catalysts:

Cohen or any savvy person knows you gotta strike the iron while it's hot.

I don't see any reason to wait, but he did have to wait until the next year so the profit incurring from the squeezes is cancelled out by expenses incurred in order to acquire more than 50% of the business in shares/options as well as the expenses incurred from acquiring the business.

Gamestop is going to report Q4 sales on the 13th of Jan or something I think unless it's a rumor.

It's just a few weeks, I personally wouldn't advise trying to time it but that's up to you.

Don't get me wrong, I was thinking about it myself until I saw this month's 13D where it was stated "the Reporting Persons (Ryan Cohen) will not hesitate to take any actions that they believe are necessary to protect the best interests of all stockholders."

The wording is MUCH MUCH stronger than the September 13D. Let's see if he stays true to his words.
I’ve paid over $5M in federal income taxes 2015-2019 and I can confirm that you are completely full of shit.

Look at the 5 or 15min chart for this week. After the first gap up it's been pinned right under 132 all week. Every time it got below 131.80 calls starting pouring in for 1/15 and 2/19. They just needed to accumulate and shake out the weak hands for the real run. 2/19 145 calls were hot.
Unless they had a catalyst coming up, I’d say your better off in PLTR

Sure but you are comparing PLTR which makes roughly a billion in revenue and is trading at 50billion with ABCL which makes around 20million and trades around 12 billion.
Just buy a 2070 or 2080 and upgrade once next gen hits

No I think my comment was misunderstood. It was severely downvoted
Don't knock it till you try it. You'll be so focused on your tender giblets resting gently on the freezing cold chunk of stone, you'll forget all about your last thoroughly researched, wsb-assured premarket call you lost everything on in the first five minutes of markets opening :3
Lucky shot, you won the lottery. Gratz mate, well done. For real.

Now don't you dare to risk that money again. Get 90+% into some safe investing like stocks, because loosing 100k on options is easy AF.

That is one of, if not the, biggest one month gain I have seen. Impressive. Don't fuck it up.
I wrote a dd on this and this has the potential to go big . At this point it’s just too expensive and too risky to invest in especially on the current given price. Majority of the partners are still in clinical trials right now meaning that the company will not have any meaningful revenue until those companies start to sell drugs as royalties are going to be their main source of income. I’d expect the stock to dip even more.
You saw that perfect pin right under 132 too. They’re just screwing with us atp

Yes!  That was him.  I don't really follow internal Chinese politics but I recall there were major Western news exposes about that power struggle.
You've the PS5? Congrats!
Here are some basics. 

There are many ways to make/lose money. 

1: Shares. You buy a share, it's yours! It's worth what it's worth. It goes up and down. Buy low and hold or sell high and pay taxes.

2: Buy Call options. This is a contract to buy 100 shares of company X at price Y, before a certain date. The contract costs a certain amount. You can sell the contract or execute it (buy the shares at the reserved price). For example, let's say I think PLTR will be worth $33 or higher by March of 2021. I can buy a $33 call option (the right to buy 100 shares at $33 per share), expiring in March, for a certain price... let's say $400. So you pay $400 for the right to buy 100x PLTR at $33 by March. If it hits $40 by March, you make 100x the difference (40-33=7x100=$700). If PLTR fails to reach $33, you loss the full cost of the contract (-$400).

3. Buy Put options. Same as buying calls, only you're betting the price will go down. A put means your willing to sell a stock at a certain price. If it goes below that price, you make 100x the difference. 

4. Sell call/put options. Stay away from selling anything unless you know what the fuck you're doing. Just don't. 

5. Start small, lose it. Start small again, lose it. Start small again, big win, pro style, Chad trades. Bankrupt. Now you're ready.

With $100, you're not going to have many choices if you're aiming for option... cheap options are typically long shots and more often than not expire worthless. Buy 1 share of several stocks you're interested in investing in/following. Use that to learn how good/bad of a choice you made and why. Keep reading, saving and eventually you might be able to jump in the game.
🚀 🚀 🚀
Tis the way
You can't. Look for a serious post from a guy here that was working in quant funds. This is similar to trading bots with predetermined strategy.
😭  

I can't see family this year because of CoVid
[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQidck9xpX0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQidck9xpX0)
Nobody. Just buy long dated calls with around 90 DTE. Don’t be dumb and buy weeklies like 90% of WSB.

Gains will be slower but more secure.
Down 40% for the month. Maybe wait
ok sweet i should be fine then lol

Fubo right?
Only time I really buy puts or short is during a bear market. There are so many possible ways to make money on stocks going up right now
Can you explain your reasoning? the short sellers have an absolute mountain of shares they need to buy, do you see an outcome where retail investors abandon this company allowing those positions to be closed without a price shock?
When did I say that?
Still you

You talking about the Bo Xilai? The guy who lost in the power struggle to Xi which got him and his posse deleted from the face of the Earth, Stalin style? It's funny because Xi ended taking over Politburo anyway by playing the long con yes man, the same thing Bo wanted to do.
Depends on your normal base hourly pay. Some people here make much less or much more than $27 so it's not much of a question.

Sold around 40 to 50% profit. Was purchasing very long dated calls. A good example was PTON $100c for September or October. 

Purchased them in June for $3.00 and sold them in July for $10/contract. Saw PTON keep rising and rising and rising. Remember in September or October that same contract worth $33/contract.

Anyone who thinks BABA is going down for good has no idea how big BABA is. It’s basically AMZN if everyone had an Alexa and was in effect forced to make all purchases in daily life through it. BABA owns Alipay. Alipay is how life functions in China. The economy would collapse without it. That’s how big BABA is. People who think this small bit of news makes the company less attractive has no idea the scale of this company.

Funny how everyone's speculating and been talking about how it's just a VIE, but at the end of the day it's just another ticker, and will act like any other. People make the CCP out to be some destroyer of worlds, gonna delist it, but like really? It's a country that's best interest is to support it's companies with the biggest powers. It would be stupid to and they're not stupid. Just trying to big dick for now to show some power because Ma is an ass going against them. If he woulda never said anything nothing woulda happened, but because he did they're whipping it out  then just gonna go back to business (and really it was only to show power over the opposing party that Ma stands by but that's a whole ass post)

I think you're an idiot if you're playing options on it though other than LEAPs. Honestly expecting a recovery by Feb/March but could be longer, either way just sitting on the shares for now.
Did something happen to NIO or is everyone just spooked on a red day?
Wow someone read the top post on r/investing.

QS has already priced in 10 years of growth at this level. What are people expecting?
Your cat will be stronger after this. Godspeed
Honestly it just makes them look even more guilty like a little kid saying “you believe me right? Right?”
Opposite of that. They anticipate an event tanking the stock price, sell so they gave negative shares, and then buy back the shares for less money (or hope to) so you they then have have zero shares.

of course there are other ways to profit off of a stock falling in price as well.
> I'm just gonna twiddle my thumbs while we wait to see if this goes sideways in a range for a bit.

With the level of short interest in these shares, the longer this trends sideways the more violent the green dildos are going to be when this breaks out.

This is like when your wife don't wanna give you a BJ on Christmas day, unless you buy her a $3K ring. Instead you went to a nearby hooker place in hopes of having the same experience for $650, only to get busted by the cops and ended up costing you $10K in court fines??? LOL
Why? Is there big bad news?
Can’t guarantee 1000 but I’d wait for a dip Monday morning, buy itm calls. Sell at a high spike. Rinse repeat. Or buy leaps. I also bought some long dated Nokia calls because it’s cheap and can pop on any new contract news. I limit to only 1 or 2 calls per ticker and have been buying shares. Tbh shares have made me more money than options because I never want to sell when I’m up on options. I always get greedy. I’m changing slowly though.
Yeah - it sucks that they get lumped in with the alibaba shit, despite being completely different / unrelated companies.
No because I am not poor.

But what *are* calls and puts?
What's your total gain?
So if I have 900 shares I’ll be awarded 200 warrants which means I’ll be able to buy stock at $23 30 days post merger. So if I spend the extra money to exercise the 200 warrants I’ll be able to capitalize on the merger and buy the stock cheaply. Then sell for a profit at what the stock price will be after the merger.  Is this correct?

Planning on getting more tickers added + cryptos, improved parsing, and maybe some charting to show upcoming tickers that are growing in popularity on smaller niche subs. That way I’ll maybe not FOMO as much 😂

Always been a fan of the libertarian idea of abolishing your national tax agency (IRS, CRA, etc) and implementing a large (and possibly progressive) sales tax.

I think Gary Johnson floated that a 28% GST would make it so the average person would pay a similar amount of taxes compared to paying income/property taxes.

It's a good idea because:

1) Can't dodge the tax. No amount of spending on accountants will enable you to dodge that 28% GST. 
2) No need for tariffs... Just reduce the GST on goods you want to promote to the consumer. 
3) No need for tax rebates. Just lower the GST on the goods/service that those people would use. 
3) No government waste running the tax agency.
4) lack of capital gains taxes will make country attractive to investors
5) lack of property taxes would... Again... Make country attractive to investors.
6) lack of a corporate taxes would attract corporate headquarters.
7) People and companies decide how much money they pay in taxes by reducing consumption and paying for products with low GST.

8) Everyone knows what is going on.
Waste of $ imho

Question, you dabble in spreads at all? Specifically call debit spreads. I’ve done lot of research on it and have concluded this is the better route to go. While your profit is capped, Ive heard your chance to make money is like 90%. I think next week i’m going to open some up. What you think of them?

Yeah exactly. They buried the hatchet and that follow-up was great. The CNBC guy wrote a book on the whole saga, too.

I think Icahn is also in on FNMA as well, which is really funny if still true. His previous average was $4 if he hasn't sold it off. If they both hold it when it goes to $30 in the next 18 months, that would be hilarious way to come full circle as two big name activists with much different strategies in the market.
But I come here for the quibble.
TDOC
Doesn't the increased raw material prices just help them cover their losses when everything shut down for 2 months?

I mean, you yourself have said it's due to increased demand from when customers were shut down. One would think that MT was struggling at that time as well.

So 2 months of (-) lost revenue, (+) increase prices => hit sales goal for the year.

The company I work for (automotive tier 1 supplier that makes steel parts), is barely making a profit this year. At the peak of the shutdowns, we were looking at only making 50% of our sales goal and being deep in the red. Now we are only looking at 1% profit this year because of increased demand. I would expect it to be similar for our suppliers.

This.  Data projects most companies invested in just gave them the ability to centrally store and access it for years to come.  Historical data, usually from multiple systems.  From there they installed resources to help interpret the data.  The problem is they don't really know what they are looking for other than measure and comparisons of the usual numbers and that's what they associate to ROI.

Pltr isn't a magic 8 ball answer to a business question, yet.  However, its value is derived from leading you to that answer.  As business grows it's measures, markets, customers and technologies will continue to change.  If you capture 50 data points today you will likely capture measure/analyze 5-10x that in coming years.  This is just the beginning.  Assume that their offering on the non gov business will evolve.
To be fair most wouldn't care not remember it but I'm sure it would help out a few people. Those that want to show off will always be in debt up to their eyeballs.
I've had this exact same sentiment. My feeling is once these moratoriums expire, it's going to cause a massive snowball effect specifically in the housing market. 

Interest rates are low due to big money moving to bonds and out of the market due to uncertainty. When evictions start up again (due to record unemployment and eviction notices, and americans are so far behind on rent) then homeowners will take advantage of the current high prices and evict and sell the first chance they get. But I'm assuming nobody will be buying, leading to market flood and house prices dropping. 

When house prices start falling, all of a sudden people are upside down on these inflated homes they bought because the mortgage rates are so low right now. 

I'm a doomsayer sure, but I see NO other outcome than a housing collapse right now. 

But I'm also retarded, so.

I’m a professional accountant so hear me out. Tax season is around the corner and we can have all these gains on the books. 

Yolo QS long calls hoping for a dump so you can show yuge losses, and when that shit pumps back up? Check mate IRS.
Buying calls would also tie up your money. Here the decision is between buying a long dated call vs buying shares of a particular company. The poster believes that the stock will go up, but doesn’t know when. The poster presumably believes that it could be a long time before the stock goes up. In this scenario, it makes more sense to choose stocks over calls in the long run, given the huge amount of risk, uncertainty and costs associated with buying derivatives. If the poster does have a strong conviction that the stock will go up, but is uncertain of timing, then it would also make sense for the poster to keep the money in the company as opposed to moving it around to investments they are less certain of.

So if this news broke today, and everybody in the market bought their one share instead of sold it, even though they weren't buying anything according to you, would the stock price go up today or go down today you fucking goof?

News influences investors, and it is their decisions on what to do with that news with regards to their shares that determine the price.  You walk around posting condescending corrections of people when you are fucking wrong, and you get called out for it.  Tough shit.

You need to learn general charting. Using the 30 min 1 hour and 2 hour time frame to really gather all the info you need is important. 

Knowing bearish and bullish patterns like head and shoulders/inverse head and shoulders, etablishing where key levels are, using up our down trends while using sup and resistance, and paying attention to bullish/bearish divergences will get you extremely far.

Be patient on your entries and quick on your exits when your pattern breaks.

may I know what was your first investment cost? Just can't get my around how one can double/triple thousand to 100K. Just curious I wanna be a gold retard as well, school is sucking all my cash.
It was evaluated at 18$...it’s a great tech with not that big of a moat. There was so much hype at ipo and people paid so much to get in... hype is slowly dying. Very bullish on the technology and the team but less on the hype
Usually slice it up in 1/2 inch pieces on a steel pan, cut some of the fat off to get a coating. It renders insanely fast. Cook about 30 sec or so each side whatever gets a nice sear. Salt and pepper. Its really rich which is why I've held off cooking it, on a 12oz steak, I can eat maybe 4oz before feeling full. So you need to be hungry or have company.
>but that's pointless since I do not know for sure what happens tomorrow.

Exactly. If we all could see the future, this shit would be cake and we'd all be millionaries. But yeah the "What if" will kill you. I try to not open a chart for a while after closing out a position, it's tempting tho!

Also grats on the 100k. that'd be a life changer for me, too (currently at 3300. started with 400 in march)

Well, letting go of one's pride is the first lesson a good trader should learn. He is just paying more tuition for that lesson than the typical person.

I checked on thinkorswim again, he is back to down $166k. And because theta decay does not take holidays, he will be down $180k if FB just opens at the same price on Monday.
This is wrong. In terms of market segmentation:

JD is basically a knock-off Amazon, BABA has two lines: taobao is for B2C and Alibaba is for B2B, PDD is a low-life dollartree store.

The immediate competitor for PDD is Taobao, not JD because JD doesn't really sell fake brand fake shits on a massive scale, and Taobao has lost much of its ground in the past few years.

It’s hard to imagine while we’re in a raging bull market but eventually this bubble will pop and when it does those tickers will fall the hardest. Everyone knows these valuations make no sense. Every retard on this sub with a 2 week old robinhood account is making money fomoing into meme companies that have never earned a dime of profit and probably never will. You really think that is sustainable? It could be in 3 months it could be in 12 months but a crash is coming and when it does people like you will hold all the way down.

A realized gain or loss is when you finally sell that position and whatever its worth becomes yours.

Please cut the sarcasm, if you think your nonexistent stocks actually influence the worth of China companies then you are genuinely fucking retarded.

You buy 1 stock in AAPL, you own it. You are influencing it. Bad news can't tank it if everyone keeps buying.

You buy 1 stock in BABA ADR, you don't own jack shit. BABA "stocks" are what people think it's worth if it was an American company. You guys are playing with nothing. Bad news will tank it because you don't fucking influence anything. BABA will continue to drop as long as HKEX holders continues to fucking dump it even if you mother fuckers keep throwing money at it. I bet you own NKLA too you dumb bitch.
This is something I can get behind
$100 ain’t jackshit with options lol u can only buy weeklies with that money. Paper trade first and stack up ur bread before u start trading 😎😎😎
True
Buy shares in big companies with a bright future, wear your seatbelt and don’t do drugs
Maybe, we'll see. If it was 42-43, I'd say it's the top. I strongly believe they will crush earnings tho and go past ATH after earnings.

He's probably referring to the fact that the OP will be taxed at the income tax rate and misused the capital gains term.

Depending on the OPs salary, it could be much lower than 35% if this is his only source of income.

They did talk a little bit about how it’s unknown if growth will slowdown in the post covid world, but they also pointed out how untapped their total market is in terms of new customers so who is to say

Personally bull on gaming and esports in the future in general and CRSR seems like a company that can manage financial metrics well (so far) so that’s also a plus

If you want a real space play, look up N P A. It’s a reverse merger with spacemobile. You can probably double your quantity of shares with it and it has potential to double in the next few weeks.

Pretty sure the safe bet is leaps on blue chip tech winners you are confident about.  Shares with margin for everything else.  For me its 50/50, sometimes I worry that I am not diversified enough.  Then I come to WSB and my approach seems very responsible.

Although I sold the call option this year at stock price +/-500...  **pre-split**. Changed to stocks. I don't regret due to the knowledge and stress I had back then. Sometimes I have the fallacy to think 'what if', but that's pointless since I do not know for sure what happens tomorrow.
Same. I'm so ready to be on a moon mission with Bill

It’s funny that no matter what your losses are robinhood still displays notifications. Imagine robinhood had ai and recognized our pain holding fd’s and said things to make us feel better. Instead the app just cheers you on to blow the remaining balance. Like wtf you know my shit say -99.9% and buying power at .69 why are telling me about tsla right now!

How is not that tying up your money short term though?  He specifically called that out, which is why I replied.  If you have a strong conviction that a stock is going to go down or be flat for the next x amount of time, why would you leave your money sitting in that stock if you didn't want to tie it up when it could be actually making you a profit?
But does CRSR have a 10x potential in 5 years?
Good

Nah don’t buy calls it’s too risky. you never know when Ackman will announce the merger. It could be Jan 2021 or it could be Dec 2021... also if there is no merger before the SPAC deadline then everyone gets their shares bought back at $20 a share. That’s the worst case scenario. Your max loss is purchase price (currently at 26.30) - 20 a share. Also if you hold through the merger, it comes with 2/9 tontine warrants. Basically u get more shares for free if u hold thru the merger!

Buy shares and get ready for a 6 month hold!

True, I meant more like Benz and Audi’s
Not for anyone but experienced breeders, especially so with frenchies, the breed has issues, you'll most likely need to artificially inseminate and have the pups delivered at the vets by c-section, there are reasons why these are expensive dogs.

There are some dogs that fetch outrageous prices for puppies that are a lot easier (cavoodles), but if you're chasing dollars then you also chasing trends on animals that live for a decade and soak up a lot of love and care in that time.

TL;DR, this isn't a side hustle, people do this because they love dogs, some make money, most do it for love.
GME please fly again
I bought more calls on the dip. Probably just end of year shit. It hit $232 in premarket yesterday so I’m not worried about it having some downtime. SalesForce is a beast. I’ve been in IT for a couple decades now and never came across more than one or two large corporations that didn’t use SalesForce or Slack.
That’s depressing asf
The ride quality and silence that cars like the S-Class or Audi A8 have is pretty amazing.
For sure man. Honestly, your best bet is to find a strategy that works for you and doesn't make you fight your own psychology. 

I've taken to locking most at 20-30% profit and just finding the next train to hop on. 20% isn't huge gains, but if you're splitting your acct between only like 2-3 stonks, shit adds up.

Anyway GL with your trading next year!
Lol, sold that two days ago right before it took off. Looking for something under 11.50 for now

Won’t be able to enjoy the weekend knowing that these will likely be down like 10% on Monday. Not a good feeling...I should not have bought these.

CLDR  u meant to say right
Didn't try margin myself, but options straight outta the gate... The portion where I was negative on the graph was a penny stock pump and dump... Never again, till the next time.
People aren't seeing how the CCP has been circling this for months and this is just the beginning. I have a feeling that BABA is going to be made an example of, and what's going to happen to them over the next year will be in business textbooks about the difference between western and chinese business.

I always had a little soft spot for JSDA. I invested back in 2013 but never really made money or lost just broke even. But I’m thinking of opening a small position maybe buying 10,000 shares. I think JSDA has potential to go up to $5, they got rid of the old CEO and improvise some of their financials. I think it’s a good bet but it will take time for it to get back.
EXCUSE US, WHO WAS HELPING WHOM HERE??? He only had to put our memes in his show, instead he made huge losses and still thinks he is more of an expert than the average authist here

This is fascinating!  I've had it all wrong for years!
$420 way too high, wouldn't $50-$60 be reasonable?
buttcunt?
That's gambling, not investing. There is no need to treat winnings separate from starting amount.
True 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Think of it this way. Lets say you got $50,000 in Amazon. But hey, you know this shits going up over the next year. Buy call leaps 6-8 months out, and for the same move you would have made 2-4x more with the options than just holding the underlying. Obviously this is an example, sometimes you buy calls too far out it may not move as much, etc etc, but you get the point.
Ban again
Lmao.. you ever been in a Benz you poor bastard!
with every dip, i kept buying more calls, once at 280, then at 255.. not sure my ass can handle any more of this lol. what exp date you thinking at this point?
Just read CRSR’s outlook update from November end and it kinda made my PP hard

Glad I bought more on the dip today fuck everyone who is selling

Wow teach me

Lmao came here to say, “none of us do either”
Not if I suck your crispy well done toaster dick first gay boi
Serious question. Why do y’all do options ? Like compared to just buying regular stocks. Or even spreads which are a lot more likely to make money. I feel like half the time people
lose money and a lot of it when playing naked calls or doing puts.
No way lol
Hard not to buy a dip like that! Why would China want to handicap their biggest online marketplace? imo it’s more of a show of who’s the boss

35c is like pennies, right?
So, maybe some1 can clue me in. I buy this call at 40c and if the stock hits 40 before the expiry date then I make money? How much money? Max cost on 1 contract is $225. That means i need $225 buying power to buy that call, right? Whats my potential profit if it hits 40?

Note: I'm okay to lose all lol
lol BABA is nothing compared to the CCP - they could nationalize this company tomorrow or transfer 100% ownership to Winnie the Pooh and you would just have to take it up the ass

Nice couch pennies
Oh nio, the day of hitting $50 is never gonna happen. Fuck me
I mean the warrants are around $4.50. Exercisable for 11.50, so $16 per share. Right now they’re a little over if not even. I’m guessing the higher return comes from the ability to buy more and then make a profit when the stock goes up? Do these warrants swap over to the new ticker or do they expire before the merger?

Yo this is awesome!!! Hopefully you bring even stronger gains in the future. Best of luck!

FUCK THESE GAY ASS MODS
jokes on you morons. i sold when i was down 80% last week and feel like warren buffett now 🤡
Lol this meme is already out dated
If you lose the remaining $420 are you depositing more? I lost 4600 (Half all of my savings) and have the other 4600 in buying power waiting for a good investment. I’m scared as fuck to enter any positions now though I have trading PTSD lolol
Shut up before I suck your dick f@g
Wow. Just wow.
HOLY FUCK IM FREEEEEEE
instead of those pltr calls shulda bet it on hawaii +7

Holding until the merger no matter what. The floor for this thing is $24. Big money already in no way they’re selling before the merger. If a nice company is announced this thing will goto $40 easily. It’s going to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀😎

Where did you spend the 600?
Idk what your point is? Doesn't change mine.
i had robinhood since 2018 but never really used it till this year but ignored the tax forms because it cost extra on turbo tax. I had less than $100 in my account those 2 years will they come after me when I actually report my rh portfolio this year?

I just tried it out. I'll let you know how it goes

word. at least three fold of whatever would have been put in.
You may be right, but I sure hope you're wrong. If you are, I'll 12/31 25c you in the stratosphere!

When did you sell
I'm riding the ICLN train, taking profits a few times a month and rolling them out about once a month. What a time
Not a bad idea🤔
This is exactly the place to be as a first time investor. Disregard the naysayers, and people who make responsible investments...
Streaming is recurring subscription revenue bro. That is far far different than retail hardware sales. Cope all you want but this thing is at the top. Best case scenario from here is a slow grind upward but lagging the overall market.
Confused - why would there be so many short sellers in the stock when it seems to be known that the stock tends to jump after a release of new generation of consoles?

More than 50% gains just with shares in tech etfs.
Yeah waiting for jan to rebalance and add more calls and shares. Dont want to realize any more gains before 2021. January is gonna be a good month for us retards. I can feel it in my left nut
Smart man
Very nice. Good work.
Yea watch it for sure and maybe set a stop limit and see what happens. I'll be watching closely also. No one ever went broke taking profit.
Honestly this was NOT the easiest year to begin trading. Coming out in the green is a win no matter the scale

That said, what is this -- a portfolio for ants???

Monthlies are the way if you are going to do anything. Obviously the gains for weeklies can be insane but so can losses. Leaps are dope too. Gives you ease of mind which is actually nice
I wonder if anyone had 1/2 of their portfolio in BABA. Sad. Not supposed to happen to a huge successful company. I didn't put half but I feel disgusted by my setback anyway
Ban u little bitch
Can someone teach me how to read these graphs?


Does it say the initial investment amount anywhere here?
I’m in it but just shares because I’m a wallstreet bitch.

I’ll join you on the moon

For holding with a $10 cost average? Literally nobody is telling you to sell retard. Glad you feel good about making the only reasonable decision. It was either this or your dick gets stuck in the toaster but I bet you did both
Time traveler slipped
Yup. RH knows how retarded their customer base is.
yeah I had January 25s. Was up like 30% the second day MT became the hype on wsb but it just kept bleeding lol.
Are you literally retarded?
Bought in on tbe originally post at $14.25 for 200 shares. Holding until $25.
Yeah I’ve never really dropped much cash on options so haven’t really thought about hedging but I guess it makes sense since leaps are expensive so lot to lose if it goes sideways. I’ll probably either do that or just buy shares
What’s your position by the way for Baba
What’s the logic for buying and selling?
Likewise asshole! Now go fuck yourself!
Looking to buy calls for mid January to Feb. What's the 🚀🚀🚀🚀 that will take me to the moon?
Yes the wording indicates he means it will go down, when he seems to really mean it won't go down.

I sold all my solar stocks at their max yesterday...I REALLY would like to get back in, but it seems hard as hell to get them on a dip these days (unless the companies are based in China, i.e. JKS, DQ).
Lost 40k today.  Whooooooo fuck you BABA
This should be discussed more around here. Certainly a risk to the moon mission.
Selling to open has unlimited risk. Could end up negative 6 figures
Yessir! I’m in with 300k worth of shares. Bought in at an average price of $26.22 lol
Just think they have jobs (the ppl who thought of this) while alot of good people remain out in the cold.
Yeah thats why im all in.

Mean reversion strategy, well done. That was pioneered in the early 80s! Renaissance trading.
Whoever had $300 calls on this got straight torn up today with that dip. It’s at $220 now but God my Christmas would be all kinds of anxiety because Monday morning open this gonna drop to $190 😭 😭

I never said NIO had a lot of revenue did I? They have similar revenue but the TAM for NIO is exponentially larger than Palantir. There is no chance PLTR can maintain their current growth rate whereas NIO will likely continue to accelerate.
Merry Xmas to all of you retards and autists 🎄

That true, but there’s also the possibility that him being in his mid-to-late-20s the VCs probably didn’t take him seriously. I can only imagine the boomers at GME do not care to listen to him given that he’s still young (35). The change he wants is at a much faster pace than what Sherman and execs think it should be. The execs probably think the pace they’re taking it is the right approach given the increase in market cap since April.
No one believed it would go up. That’s what made it difficult
Bro, it’s called a joke. This is WSB. Fuck off Mr. “you do realize”.  Don’t be mad because instead of a bonus you got the jelly of the month club membership. Merry Christmas!
Fine line between posting your opinion after getting a position and encouraging others to follow and a pump and dump
Most sold too early, and are now regretting it. In other words, still retarded.
Eh half joking at this point

BABA will either moon or crash in the coming weeks
[deleted]
A well trained monkey could do that
God forbid we ‘overheat’ our economy
Yo, funny ass animation, but I just want to comment that there is NOTHING wrong with selling half at 200% gain. Half the idiots in this sub end up dead in the water because they refuse to lock even partial gains.

Personally, if I'm even nearing 80%+, I lock at least 25%. I also do stonks not options tho.
Come on bro! Always something to celebrate, if you lost tendies, u learned not to lose them for 2021!
Hmm so after he has posted some new pics, does this point still stand?
You easily could have taken profits at the top then doubled down when it sank but you got greedy and doubled down. Last time I checked pigs get slaughtered
But you currently have -20k+, you won't even show the other positions. That means even though there is more money, it's coming from you
He may have been in the money for less than a day depending on what he YOLOed. That's why you attach good-til-canceled limit orders to take profits automatically.

Exactly - he originally said he would hold GME until a double. Then he sells within a week. He is playing this sub for his pump and dumps now

Notice how this stock is a low float SPAC with low volume? Easy pump and dump target
[deleted]
1. I suppose my concern there is the hard concavity and slope value checks
2. How does buy&hold compare when using those earlier backtest start dates?
nope
Why would they do these special dividends? Never seen anything like that before.
Warrants give higher returns. Theyre similar to options
Commenting to come back later
This shit again?
Why can’t Christmas be on the weekend. This is bearshit. I’m gonna have to do some parlays this weekend.
100% of available cash + same amount on margin.

I see the exact moment you YOLOed....
I dunno I don’t know Chinese
Every time it drops a couple dollars tho, it fuckin slingshots back up. Just the Ark way.
Probably, but at that price why not just buy shares?
Since you're new, I'm going to tell you this now -- Continue to just buy shares (Not like shares of GME, just in the future, buy shares rather than options)

Idk how much money you put into GME, but you would be like 80% down easy depending on what kind of options you bought.
Yes
to retards with FD calls, -0.7% in a day is a world ender
You know how when you cum inside a woman some of your seman infect her brain and make her smarter? Which man did this to cathie wood? I want to follow his moves in stocks

The second company I was with legit have a mass exodus of all of its lower level employees, luckily I was the first one because I heard shit got right there when management caught on
Nice job. Go fuck yourself
I backtest strategies similar to yours and have a program that scans the market for tickers that meet my technical requirements for entry each day.

I would suggest adding an RSI component to your requirements.

Bear in mind that as the market changes, these strategies need tweaking. It’s a bit more complicated than you assume, but not by much. 

Don’t be a bitch and use a strategy like this to buy stock. Calls only, mf. If you want to minimize risk then do diagonals.
[deleted]
If you watch it from the perspective of satire, it's pretty damn funny. Maybe they can save me from bankruptcy from going all in PLTR too.

I mostly held steady until I dabbled with options right before the September 1 2020 correction. Then I went all in on PLTR when they went public.

You don't think the way people operate on daily bases has changed? You don't think companies that used to spend thousands of dollars on employes traveling for meetings will change company policy? Do you think streaming will suddenly decrease when Covid is gone? 

I don't own Home Depot, but if you cannot understand that covid has changed a lot in our societies than you are a fool. And FYI, Covid will be a part of our lives for a minimum of two more years.. we won't be going back to our offices until 2022.

Well I described exactly what robinhood does and you said something different, so yeah.
i think nio is a good bet if you give yourself more time, jan might be a roller coaster with the senate race, stuff might go nuts upward or downward, dudes will shift their portfolios and NIO might be a huge beneficiary or the other way around. im gambling a lot but its mostly with my profits, i still got some loser AAPL Square Paypal GM blah blah leaps

Yeah, probably right. I might put some money in for a longer play.
You worded it wrong FYI. Seems like you think it'll go down, threw off the whole message
I like the sound of STWD. Cheaper than most other high yield dividend stocks. Pretty consistent performance and the dividend % is crazy. I’m thinking I will diversify between T and STWD
I wish,  took out a loan for it 😂
NIO has no reason to fall only good news incoming and they are directly controlled by the CCP. Baba is gunna be ok in the long run the company has more potential than Amazon, people are just so fucking dramatic and forget fundamentals

so your gonna wait for everything to run up and let all of us make profits, and then when it bursts 6 months - 1 year later you're gonna hope it makes another run? why not just get in now lol
Exactly. And look at the comments in your thread. People were laughing at the idea of GME breaking out. Now they're shitting their pants at the mention of not "mooning". Its a dangerous mindset.
So it currently doesn't spit out a response for buy, sell, or hold? The output graph is a bit difficult to interpret because I can't tell what day the algo called to buy/sell
With a strong routine and realistic approach you will see more gains year by year at least, Dont discount yourself
I’ll look more into it. I know of it. I think that’s what I’ve been doing the whole time but I’m retarded. From what I see from my short time here is that as long as you’re not making crazy weekly otm calls you make gains in meme stocks. As long as they’re at least like 6 weeks out. That’s what I’ve been doing.... and it’s working 🚀
They just gonna reload for a magnificent flight
Good for you.  I was homeless too once.  I didnt have wsb to help me out though.  Just my two hands and my sweet mouth.  The fellas at the dock still recognize me from time to time.

Thetazon been murdering options since July. I'll get in when it gets over 3250.

Seems like most people don’t remember this, or too young to have lived through the financial crisis. Cramer is entertaining, can give some clues. But lots of people lost their retirement accounts in those days and blamed Cramer.
“Metrics”? Are those those number things? Just looks at the green line retard

Casa Cuba Flor Fina, great cigar.
I bought 23 call  at close yesterday and sold at open.  Made 5 bucks and someone lost 21 as is expired
chinese companies can all go fuck themselves so far as I'm concerned.
So is it like giving money to charity?
cramer wishes he could chat with us under his real name- he'd get lit up if he actully posted anything here
Oh wow. So it can either moon or crater? 50/50 ? And if the vote doesn’t pass, it tanks ?
Exactly!
That does cover it. That shit almost doubled yesterday and you had alot of calls in XL. I thought you were full of shit too until I saw that.

I've got full-blown Autitsm though. So if any of them reading this are trying to breed, they better have those feeling good kinda titties, or I'm taking a star away.
I was down about $4,000 when the stupid penny stock I was fucking with tanked, completely unrelated to covid. Me being smart decided to hold it for a bouncy that never happened. 

Around that time I was looking at PLUG for like $5 a share, but held my penny stock like a moron. Then the major tech company I work for decided to use zoom for their meetings and I thought about buying it at $112 a share, but that seemed expensive and I didn’t think the lockdown would last as long. 

I needed to buy a car and bought a model 3 in March and started watching a bunch of review videos. Eventually that had YouTube suggesting Tesla stock videos. I finally took the loss on my penny stocks on July first and bought six shares of Tesla pre split and made $1600 in a week. So that hyped my up and I started putting every penny into Tesla along with a few other trades here and there. 

So I’m up a total of $17,000 for the year and up about $21,000 since I stopped fucking with penny stocks. 

What a crazy year.
Isn’t Nancy famous for insider trading with Visa IPO? She’s one of us.

You should be setting up your IBKR account now then cuz its a bitch to deal with them. Took me months to go through the checks and balances. Also IBKR isn't like Robinhood, if you don't make 100k yearly you're going to have to lie multiple times on your options permission application to buy/sell them.
Cash out atleast 20k so when you lose it all you can atleast start over

You say that, but the CCP could very easily pivot into another e-commerce giant. BABA’s assets could be sold off, the entire thing could come crashing down.

Unpopular opinion: Tesla’s mission was never and will never be about making money. Elon Musk is not like Bezos. He will 100% compromise profits if it helps him reaching Jupiter or wherever he wants to live in now
Just a few that interest me. I have fantasies of becoming wealth independent from my shrewd investments but in reality my capital is a pittance and I work too much to really ever be able to do that. But hey that's modern serfdom! Trickle me timbers
I was thinking the same thing. I’m not an options expert by any means but all of the major trading platforms have “Retard Gates” setup. On Schwab it isn’t even possible for me to purchase a contract like he’s describing. It’s not even an option for selection *if I wanted to*. He probably did something else but no idea what. Bought puts on accident then panic sold and lost a shitload of money? Idk.

How much?
It's only a goal post move if you're a fucking retard with the critical thinking of a road kill nodding in agreememt to everything people say about $GME.

Understand the most basic thing; **the squeeze WILL happen.**

People who keeps saying it's today/Monday/Tuesday are just trying to get all the paper hand pussies and overthinking small capital bitches to pump, hastening the short. A typical good retard take would be that they are addicted to the rocket euphoria and don't want it to stop, I mean who wouldn't be? But the truth is flatlines is when people may start leaving, see AMD past few months and how much people want to fucking leave AMZN. 

Speed of the short squeeze will heavily determine whether EOY stays at 20-22 or rockets to the fucking moon, because that's where all the useless FOMO mother fuckers will buy in. Day traders are the most fucking ADHD pussy sack of shits that exist on the planet, they rather earn 5 dollars a day rather than do weeklies or long even if it's something like AAPL.

If the squeeze keeps getting delayed, paper hands and your typical bitch tits will definitely get manipulated and leave at small profit. The only way it gets rocket to the fucking moon by EOY without the short squeeze happening, is if Cohen announcing that he upped his stocks even more. Other paths to the moon without a short squeeze would be Q4 earnings report or announcement of ecommerce platform(or concretely working on it) but then that is way past EOY. Chances of GME annoucing that they are working on ecommerce before EOY is about the same as striking the lottery and getting struck by lightning at the same time.

News drive prices, otherwise CRSR wouldn't be dumped like crazy.
Im sorry I'm here to make money

Lol that's my retirement plan
Is it a good idea to park cash in BRK-B though? Or should I hold onto it and wait
 for the next decline?
Ah a ghost shit
That’s my outlook on it. $450 a month in dividend gives me $450 $0.01 gambles every month. That’s x450 leverage. If I get a good one I win $4.5 - $7,200, that max win becomes $55 more to gamble each month.  If I lose, that’s lost taxable income. The day you get enough income from it to quit your job, and have gambling money you are set.

Edit: assume the stock rose well above the strike. The option price going from $0.01 to $16.00. It would be $4.50 to $719,550. The dividend increase from the reinvestment is now around $5,985. 

From there on blow it all except what you owe for taxes.

That site is the biggest toxic shithole of a forum I've come across. They all act like they're oppressed because they have to work "hard" to warn 200k+ salaries. And plenty of complaining about "diversity hires" stealing their promotions when most of them are foreigners themselves.

I only used the site to get a estimate of what I should expect as a salary since I hadn't applied for a new job in a few years. And honestly, that's the only thing the site is good for. It's pretty much just a dick measuring competition over who has a higher TC
Personally my 3 big dividend stocks are Starwood Property Trust (STWD) 9.8% Verizon (VZ) 4.3% and Abbvie (ABBV) 5%. 

Whatever you do get a couple and diversify in different areas. Reinvest your dividends into whichever dividend stock you can get the cheapest at the time. If one dips use the dividends of the others  to buy more.

Maybe they are like every other fucking ticker today and got sold off in the first five minutes then pinned under a price the rest of the day. Disney the only one that broke above . I'm about to start taking Friday off.
Follow up: What do you do to hedge against market crashes (like march this year)? One of my safe bets went from a steady +10% per year to -50% in a week. It's gonna take 7 years to get back to where it was, probably.

What I mean is, when you collect gains, where do you put them that's protected from such events? Gold? Real estate? A retarded 0.1% interest savings account?

Or do you buy lots of puts when your knees tell you a storm is coming, but leave your stock alone?
No worries, you just have to get a 50 times return of investment for next year. Proud of you retard!
Thank you for this play 👑. Ima 💎👐

If you don’t work at Wendy’s, I strongly urge everyone to look at your companies 401K plans. I forgot the exact number but 70% of Americans don’t know wtf is being taken out of their paychecks every two weeks. Investment companies will milk the shit out of you with high expenses.

Great stuff. Could use a bit more cuss words, however.
Curious what BABA will do in HK
I’ve never done a leap tbh, just a couple few months out calls on AAPL and ICLN so far but feel like ARKG should be easy money as well. How do you hedge your leaps? Buying a put as well?

That only happens if people have money sitting in cash waiting to buy. This market is so insanely bullish and greedy right now nobody has any cash left and even if they did why put it into a covid bubble stock when covid is almost over?

Maybe a small dip in Q1. The rest of 2021 is going to shoot upwards, all over your moms tits.
So they decided to drop all the good news after close

No idea. I’m hoping for 50% profit early Monday and get out. My luck it will go down 50%
What that trader did that was illegal was he created a lot of orders and canceled them to create the impression there is a lot of buy interest.  The SEC considers that market manipulation.  What OP suggests is just trading ideas.

Edit: by a lot I mean thousands and tens of thousands.
Thanks for the advice bro. Saved your comment so I can come back and read again to absorb everything. Currently have a lot of family over and can’t focus. Merry Christmas

Great write up.

I struggle with 12. I always feel like it's too late to double down. 

For example: I invest 1 portion of money into CompanyA+. The stock performs beautifully and is worth 5 portions of money by the time I have another portion of money ready to invest. Now I could "double down" on CompanyA+, but since that would only take the investment from 5 to 6 portions, it feels like a drop in the bucket and I end up searching for another stock that hasn't had such a run up yet to invest in.
Some people just get coding. It’s not for everyone
Good on you. I went autist and bought 12/31’s
Yeah exactly. Maybe a little down the road from now. I'll grab the code here shortly and will take a look. Amazing idea and thanks for sharing. Quite happy to collaborate on this in the future.

This is a stay at home stock that has benefited from covid and guess what? Covid is coming to an end. You still holding Home Depot too?
Same dude! Haha steel to the moon
Im trying to get better at selling the real ups and downs. Not like the dumb shit day trading, more like on a weekly or even monthly basis. Bought in few that doubled, the stagnated, then started dipping, and exited about 80% up. Really considering buying back in when they're down again.
Have you tried putting it on Wumbo
Then Brexit happening the week after will dip the market back to Earth.
I know nothing about RBLX - thanks for the heads up 👊

Well, I’m no expert on the matter. Maybe. Maybe not.

This can't be more accurate fuck me
Vanguard is a wonderful company. Look up what the founder did for us average shmucks. I have my entire Roth and 401K with them.
BABA is nothing like Luckin’s accounting scandal. Big nothing burger for BABA will jump 5-10% on Monday. I bought my kid a Winnie Pooh Toy to celebrate it.
If you didn’t convert your calls into shares over a long weekend then you ain’t even black
Alex Jones is ultimate WSB chad. Cramer is a crying baby back bitch
Another 10-15% sounds likely
Well done! Yeah been an amazing year. Up over 7000%  it’s amazing. Very grateful!!
I like this idea
So they buy in, find any positive outcome and sell them?
baba going to 100s soon :S
What’s a good entry for fubo? feel like this thing will be triple digits I’m the future.
Even if you know options, it is best not to trade options when you open your eyes in the bed soon after you wake up. Things are usually blurry in those moments. Go freshen up, get some coffee or breakfast to jump start your brain first.  In my case, I was trying to sell 10 call options (covered calls) and entered 100 instead.
Did I fuck up buying the baba dip?
Yo right?  Make a few mil.  Spread it across dividend stocks and other boomer investments like bonds and treasury securities (LMFAO), and live off the \~4% return.  4% of 3 million is 120k a year.  120k a year to do nothing sounds like a dream to me.

Im burning through jobs as well, i miss the people but the companies i was with were for a quick check anyways, basically prostitution.
It’s too perfectly irrational. When it looks too obvious the only profitable approach is the George Costanza philosophy until all the aggressive money gets collected.
They settled a lawsuit from a former employee that had been seen as a potential obstacle to a merger; some are seeing that as a signal that a DA is imminent. Could be that, could be something else, I don’t know.
"My company"
thats nuts
They are 🤡
Options on BABA were weird today. The stock went up 7 points from 11:30 and calls kept dropping
Shares? Boring.. FDs? Stupid.

A large position of LEAPS calls and shares mixed, appropriately leveraged delta given the IV and price of the underlying? Rich

Time for the AMZN coil to unwind 👀
Nothing is rational in the real market
Yes. If you hold through the merger and don't abandon the stock you will be awarded two warrants (at $23) for every 9 common shares you own. Exercise at 30 days post merger or July 2021.

22 warrants for every 99 commons, etc.

Just hoping we get back to ATH of 33.50 sometime in the next 4 weeks. If that happens, I’m out and exit with $100,000 gainz. I’m long term bullish but pretty sure there is gonna be a dump of shares, once lock up expires. Not interested in bag holding.

Ok thanks. I had skimmed the S-1 awhile back and that was my understanding, but I’m not an expert so I wanted to make sure I wasn’t missing something.
Think about it like this bro “I could have anyone of them but I’m in no rush.”
I have 6c for that date and I’m not worried. Was up over 100% the day I bought it but fucking day trade restricted. If you read some of their threads it’ll definitely make you feel better about it for now but come Monday we’ll have a better idea
Infinity DTE shares.

I trust Cathie enough not to gamble on her lol
A bit of smoothing on the graph, to take out the noise perhaps?
Anyone still locking gains or tax loss harvesting will be finishing up Monday and Tuesday so their trades can settle within the 2020 tax year. There is also the potential for more stimulus/budget vote shenanigans so you might not be totally hosed.

Ah yes, classic buy the news
Idc what the price tag is, no one looks good in a turtleneck. And congrats on the nkla gains!

Really nice to hear you’re doing well now and i wish you all the best and a merry Christmas retard
Go back and tell her you work at Wendy's, so she knows you have stuff in common and gives you a shot.
Damn Ive ripped off in the past guess i have to do more research before buying
I just held. I was holding OSTK for a long time, sold half then diversified. Then I sold half my TSLA when I was 100% in profit, then bought other positions
Merry X-mas you retards thanks for helping a new (+newly unemployed-fuk you CA) dad make some money. My first purchase was PLTR + ASAN on the direct offering -we're up 21k since

But those are too expensive,  frand
We'll see what happens Monday
The current situation with Jack Ma reminds me a lot of that governor in a central Chinese province- whose name I can't recall - the one who a few years was building his own red guard divisions.  He had 1950s style propaganda posters of Mao all over the city along with his own portrait and was seen as a threat by the Politburo.  Overnight they shut him down and threw his entire inner circle into the deepest, darkest re-education camps.  Dozens were arrested and there were army units brought in from other provinces to surround the provincial capital.
Sounds like cancer
Man. Theta going to be eating my nio and pltr calls all long ass weekend.

I hear ya. Often times I’ll sell my initial investment and invest it in a new winner. The rest I leave in there and it usually keeps going 🚀
Boomers really are retarded for putting their accounts in this shit
At this point, I'd sell some puts and wait to get assigned - that way you are buying when it's low, and otherwise getting premium while you wait. Like 5-10% otm
YOUR DOWN VOTES MEAN NOTHING!  I'VE SEEN WHAT MAKES YOU UPVOTE.

I'm also still in with 100 shares and a $13.50 cost basis.   Just not in for the long term because its bleak.  Someone just made a good post about SPACS and how they are to make short term gains and are riskier in the long run.

My brother is homeless for Christmas for the first time ever, feels weird man
Those numbers make me sick. I know I have no reason to feel like I missed out but I do. Took a lot of restraint to not fomo buy a put or two this morning
hi
Definitely not, but we can still hope
And the fundamentals haven’t changed that whole time. This company is obsolete and will be out of business soon. WSB coordinating a pump and dump doesn’t change that.
You don't want a girl that's with you for the money so that's good.
bullish, the "govt" is half the problem.
Just shat and wiped and it was completely clean. Not like 99% clean, 100% fucking clean
It's not tho.. The company is showing green numbers, covid had turned the world to work differently. PCs in the households are increasing, number of people streaming is more than ever, nber of gamers are constantly increasing.

Corsair is definitely not undervalued for its potential market cap. And they make some of the best products out there, a lot better than Razr and are Logitech.

The price has dipped, but it will continue to rise long term, the company is most likely the best in its franchise and had a lot of room to grow.
So high risk reward for bottoms haha
Neither is 1/15
Wut

I use my 401k as protection from me red dildoing my ass from time to time.

For me, this is a long term hold. I won't be selling any of it for a long time and so the warrants are just simplified and in the bag in my head at $23.

Intriguing. I like BABA but don’t know much about antitrust in China yet. If you can get comfortable with it, BABA will continue to be a good stock. That said, splitting up BABA might okay and unlock value.
What’s your next play
This is correct.

What I meant was.. that in the context of trying to make $15k a month with $1.5M of the underlying.. was that if the underlying blows through the strike, you'll have your shares called away, but if you're trying to maintain $15k a month you'd have to buy back into the underlying at a higher price, and thus have fewer shares than before

Every transaction is by definition a buy and a sell, not sure what you mean here. 

The CEO was apparently very upbeat about next year. Do you think she was lying then? And what reason do we have to believe the market will start understanding the lack of demand in the coming months?

Shit you right, your personal habits are indicative of the entire market! All the people camping in front of GME on Black Fridayand inside of the store for the last month must have actually been hallucinations. I really need to stop doing acid while I do DD

Its def not a bad way to do it. Just keep in mind you have to exit the position at some point to make a profit.

Today saved most of my covered calls. 2.2k out at $20 with $12 basis, but luckily in my Roth and not the taxable account

Tl;dr: 14k shares at $12 and 180 calls between Jan-July $15-$30
Yeah I’ve done -70% before in a day, lol. But that was when I had only $4000 in my portfolio and did all in on Tesla for battery day. Lol.
Why do you think that we're gonna bust through to $33 before the lockup?
But was it tax free, and did the mm match your investment?
His $BABA calls killed normies and boomers who bought it yesterday
So, wait for another dip and buy?
Lol
He posted but his comment is hidden
No it's the final merger vote. Not sure when the ticker changes but it is usually pretty quick and some brokers won't have it right away so if it dumps you may not be able to sell. Just a warning.
You're getting downvoted but atm you can only see your comment by looking at your profile.

I always wonder with things like this, how was anyone supposed to know to buy OSTK earlier this year? Was it just all related to covid (like how buying ZM made sense I guess for those who did) or did something else happen to make you anticipate it? What are you doing now to anticipate similar growths elsewhere or should we just follow the memes lol
When will options be available ?

News drives the price, not investors. "Investing" in China ADR stocks like BABA is equivalent to playing price is right, because you don't actually own anything. You win money by guessing how far they can go so you can sell nothing at that higher price point. How the fuck are people still thinking they influence China stocks lmao

Kicking myself for missing the Hasbro boat. $35 buy in now at $95. I pulled all my stocks currently expecting a market crash in the next few weeks. I'm gonna dive back in with my $800 and go all in on something. I want to do options but every time I try to learn, I get real smooth brain. 2021 is gonna be fun!

Ok thanks. Then if you sell in the 30 days after the merger your 2/9 warrants are redistributed to others instead of transferring to the buyer of your shares, right? Until then the warrant rights transfer with each sale of a share? (Well technically 9 shares)
Why are you so angry? Lose some money?
Hey bby 😘
I put in 1k last month and I'm at 5k after having pulled out my initial 1k. Just playing with profits thanks to WSB's PLTR->MGNI->GME plays (and BEAM somewhere as well)

I sold at $56 with a nice profit and then YOLOd right at $61 on the run up
I agree. This is just China showing the world and other companies their power. This will rally hard. A lot of institutions own this. I’m already over leveraged with my calls and 40 shares at $255 so I’m chilling for now. But this is just shaking weak hands out. Take a break, come back in a month and re-evaluate then.

It doesn’t have the be a bad Christmas. Money, women, stuff in general shouldn’t effect your mood. The sooner you realize that relying on external things to change the way you feel internally doesn’t work, the more free you will be. 

My recommendation, if you are around others right now and have been acting/feeling pouty - tell them you’re going to change your mood and you’ll be back in a little. Go on a walk or go sit in a room alone and decide that you’re going to have a good Christmas. Stay in the room or on the walk until you can make this deal with yourself then come out. Hope you have a good Christmas dude.

No that is why we gamble our lifesavings away!
The key is the merger completion not the LOI. Upon completion of the business combination you either hold the stock and get the warrants on the other side of the ticker change, or opt for the $20 NAV.

Once the ticker flips, you'll have warrants at $23 in other words that are exercisable 30 days after the merger or July 2021
What do ya'll want for Christmas? I'll start, PLTR $35 EOM
If you have the “hello new taxable income” and gamble it all away, do you have tax on it or not?
Is this guy buying commons in large positions or calls or what is the strategy here? Clearly throwing a ton of money at anything can yield these kinds of numbers but this is risky AF and can’t last unless his risk management is also as good as his picks.

I feel bad for people in Ghyna. Imagine working hard to get out the rice paddies and have a decent job where you can now start investing. You remember being told “GHYNA NUMBA WON” all throughout your life so you decide to buy BABA at $300 only to discover the only people making money live on George Washingchads land.
Smart dude
Feel bad for the kids with shitty parents this Christmas. Part of why I gamble is to set this one kid I know up for college later down the line. I have about a decade to do it. Hopefully some YOLO's pan out.
So when he sells the calls, someone will buy his contracts that he paid to someone else within the bid/ask range and that is where is gain is? Someone is paying a premium on his premium for buying calls from someone else at a higher strike price a year and a half in advance because no one would think that GME would🚀 but because diamond hands he’ll 🚀🚀🚀?
IDK
Lol yes we do

Horrible advice. Paying out to a charity will still require capital expenditure. $200 at an H&R Block office and they'll set you up to roll your tax debt forward over the coming years, so he'll only have to pay a few thousand vs. 35% short term capital gains tax all at once.
How is the price defined though?

Come on in, retards.  The water is warm.  Just don’t sell.
Put it this way, I'm slightly negative yearly on my play/yolo acct from having to fight back from some big losses and I've still donated here and there from my big  wins and trust me I haven't felt bad about it once. So I'd probably take that raise and if i could keep even a dollar more after taxes by donating that extra income you bet your wife's ass I'd jump through hoops to donate to something I care about instead of handing my money to the government to set on fire.

It's more likely than not based on his personality. He is an extremely controlling person that is not keen on take orders from others. Look at the articles about his time running Chewy - when meeting with VCs for funding, he never thought that he should change his strategy but was frustrated that others didn't see his vision. While this is not a bad thing since he did a great job with Chewy and can bring that same energy to GME, his personality definitely would not mesh super well with having to answer to shareholders if GME stayed public.

Sell your losing positions to reduce your taxable gains. If you have $5,000 in realized gains and you’re sitting on a $5,600 unrealized loss, then you’d better close that loss. Otherwise, you’re overall down $600 and you still have to pay ~$1,000 to the IRS for that realized gain.

Close for a loss, and now you have a $600 deduction instead of a $1,000 tax bill.
It's tricky. I exited my positions at a HUGE loss today. BABA is a great company but I have 0 faith that the Chinese government is going to be lenient to them after what Jack Ma said. These guys have a bigger ego than all of the Trump family combined, no way they'll let him just walk away. It's also going to be used to teach a lesson to other companies to behave themselves or be prepared to face Xi's wrath. 

Probably many months before BABA starts gaining momentum again at this point.
Graham Stephan taught me it’s not losing, it’s “tax harvesting”. Now you can be reinvited to your wife’s boyfriends house tommorow for Christmas.
So yesterday BABA $230p for 12/24 were selling for $.02/contract at their low and today they were worth $18/contract at peak. You damn well know there were some insiders turning $100 --> $90,000 in one day. 0\_-
How about the type of fucking retard who hasn’t touched an option maybe? Lmao
Don’t know - RH is garbage.
If there's a wide bid ask it will put in a limit order halfway between unless you edit it, and it will warn you that there's a wide bid-ask. I use the app, fuckhead. I know.

>GME?

gme has a 1.4bn market cap. Billions going into it would make price skyrocket. 100 million could probably do that.
Dude how, what stocks did you invest in??
This needs to be way higher up. No one in this sub understands algo trading to know what to look for in a “good” back test

this OP is acting like he just invented fire and these autists stand to lose even more money than they already are
Why arkg down go :(
What a coincidence that's me now! The homeless and $4 to my name part...
I don’t believe you were ever homeless tho bro like fuck.
Im not gunna lie to you guys but after working in an office and being only around thick thick girls ive developed a taste for them. Almost like the first time I tried wine, now I get it.
Yes, this is what I meant
I am in the same situation.  Congrats!
I’ll bet you it won’t go to 200 by expiry that’s for damn sure. The Nikola of batteries
I really don't understand the value in holding GME stock. Is a short squeeze possible? Yep and it's looking more likely lately but you can get those kind of returns from options of all types and you stay fluid
Pleas*
Without news I wouldn’t bank on it
You bought QS at peak boy why were you expecting
Merry fucking Christmas
How do i invest in tinfoil hats
That'd be amazing
I've been reading this sub for almost two years and its mainly for the entertainment value. This sub has top tier memes..

Which is why its being blasted as "dangerous" by some professionals. 

People from r/all occasionally see one of those top memes and start thinking they can Yolo their life savings in a get rich quick scheme. 

But its not this sub's fault. 

Its the casual newbies that dont do proper DD before jumping into shark waters. They may not be listening to their wifes boyfriend either. Thats on them. 

Tl:dr...Dont be a moron. Laugh at the memes but think before you Yolo actual money.
I said he would never be broke again, not that he could retire early. Bro was living in a box a couple years ago
Girls don't exist on this sub.
Why did I laugh so hard at this?
RIP your calls
Yeah I got the hell out of here this morning while flat. Didn't want to sit through the losses and slow build back up. Hope you bulls have luck diamond handing, I'm sure it will be fine come Jan 21, I just sensed much better opp. cost elsewhere.
*nine
Pmok3! I'm sorry to have disappointed you but I'm glad to see you here! Long time no see.
Yea it had a great day today and AH looks good. Monday is the vote so I would hope for continuation. The gamble with SPACs is on ticker change day when it goes from spac ticker to company ticker. Some run like QS and others tank like Canoo. It's like gambling on ER.
Because it’s overpriced. Just because the company is well run doesn’t mean you should buy the stock at any price.
What do you think about the current dip in BABA??
I’m thinking the same thing, I’m up 458%, 71% last 30 days, I’m going to at 25-40% dry powder First of year.
Good time to do some great dd. what do you make out of the gilead rumors?
Fuck yeah it is.
Cant play in the game with no skin in the game. Anyone who was already holding in that case would get to participate but paper handed bitches watching from the sideline obviously arent going to get to participate. Something something time in the market beats timing the market. Also you’re playing yourself if you’re still using robinhood so thats on you.
These r all shit

Inverse all this


Gonna buy baba 

Gonna short tsla


Ure right about Amazon is shit
I believe that kind of trade is called a risk-reversal.

Yes. 20 at $16.50 and made about $310 in options on the way up. I’ll buy more if it goes back under $25.

We love you too 

Merry Christmas Retard
I get that 2020 has sucked...but this is the greatest year I’ve had in a long time. Lost a ton of weight, doing very well financially and mentally. Met a lot of new people. Picked up a bunch of new hobbies. And I found this sub. I’m pretty happy with 2020.
Fuckin pltr
Yes plz. A fire sale would get me so hype
PTON sounds to me like "Python" which in vulgar spanish "Pitón" (the pronunciation) means "Big cock".
So. How many billions went out of BABA in the last 30 days? Where is all this money going? GME?

Honestly there’s no “right way” to research stocks. If you’re new I’d recommend watching YouTube videos about investing, there’s tons of information out there. Just take any advice with a grain of salt and make your own informed decision. Don’t jump into trades, read about the news surrounding it, watch how it moves, see what normally happens during big events, look through their quarterly presentation and listen to them talk about where they see the company in the future, look through their balance sheet, do they have a ton of debt? Are they expected to increase their dividend? Where are they allocating capital? It sounds confusing but once you get a hold of the basics is actually pretty simple. Just don’t feel like you need to jump into a trade. There are always new oppurtunities
I'm sorry but treating wsb like we're some underground financial heroes is fucking cringe. We're retards gambling on stocks and often losing money (at least I am lol)
I woulda thought we got up to at least 382 before end of year and then dumped but nah. Just a small dump here and there and SPY looks like a shit sandwich that teases you with its succulent buns.
Ironically the more money you have the less you have to pay your taxes. That is because the IRS is severely underfunded and cannot afford people lawyering up. This was probably done in purpose for obvious reasons

Then link me to the right one, sistaaaa.
Exactly this. Made so much off of SPACs. Goev. Has been a bit disappointing but I still got in at $12 so its all good. Also I strongly believe it will hit 30 within q1

Ironic considering how basic your script is. Couldn't even do a basic tax check before posting this useless shit. Not surprised the teenagers here lapped it up. Maybe it'll help them recover from PLTR and GME tanking in a month?

Yeah at this point I feel like we just gotta hope we don’t start looking like black mirror within the decade.

This isn’t a political sub, and I would never claim to be an expert, but best case scenario (investment-wise) means all world governments are purchasing and using their surveillance products, among other products and purchasers, obviously. Not saying the technology is good or bad on its own, but it seems really, really hard for that to end up being a net positive for freedom, privacy, rights of the accused, law enforcement deescalation, etc. 

Again, just my opinion.
So basically your new strategy is 100% gme.  This guys fucks.

Is this a viable strategy - Selling a slight OTM put 6 months out and buying that same strike and date as an ITM call in order to reduce the cost basis of the call?
I think demand tends to be inelastic in something like steel. You're not going to halt a project because steel now costs a bit more.

Man fuck the market it feels so dumb right now the pattern is so predictable throughout the day..... dump at open —> rise to green —> peak before 11 —> slow decline into close...... really getting pissed off at this

Other things I’ve learned this year 

1. Never intraday trade SPACs 
2. Never short Tesla 
3. Never buy $SE options 
4. Amazon manipulates the entire market 
5. AMD is the king of gayness that will never hit $100 sorry 
6. China stocks are unreliable 
7. 99% of the time FOMOing means you buy at the top and it sells off in the next 30 minutes 
8. Getting banned from Robinhood doesn’t help my gambling addiction
9. If it has a good run profit takers will crash it tomorrow.... unless it’s PTON
If it's a closed transaction, you can likely offset. Also need to consider the wash sale rules and probably a medley of other stuff to really make it confusing.

Alibaba is younger than I am and Chinese stocks are extremely volatile.

And when you say "China doesn't f--- around" I hope you know the reality of the situation. Their courts have a 99% conviction rate, trials last less than an hour, there's no formal plea deals or dispositions, China has some of the highest rates of official executions in the world, and many judges have been busted for taking bribes. That- is how it works in China.
You’re not ready for option trading. I am trying to learn it, and constantly stay confused, so I just stay away from options right now.

His railroad company returns something close to 16% dividends and has doubled from the bottom with a known trading pattern based on season. It‘a an amazing stock to day trade due to the volatility and gap in the bid/ask spread if you know how to work a bid/ask spread(where I learned before moving onto options).

Did you buy it at 213 or 222?
Nein
I just realized. So I got a spread and calls. Bought a different strike price (confirmed in messages) while acct shows a diff call w no spread. For example - bought 230c, my acct shows 220c
That’s a lot of photoshop
You can do that?
The only tendies you will see are at McDonald’s when you’re working
Statistically speaking, there's a 50/50 chance of earning/losing money.

It isn't. The only way it happens is if Cohen pulls out, but he showed us and told us he won't. He told us he will do what is in the shareholders best interest.   
A man is only as good as his words, especially in business. If Cohen pulls out now, he will lose all my respect, but he won't.
My guess is more stagnation
What I took away from this interview was buy long calls on any company Ackman has a 20% short position on so he can inflate the price of that company when they get bought out.

nice. what tactics u changed if u dont mind me asking? what did u used to do (so i cud avoid it hopefully) and what do u do now? thnx. and congrats again. im currently like 30% down on everything so i gotta do soemthing about it 😂
I can so relate. I can have an amazing trade. Close the position and instead of walking away Iwatch it every minute and see this going up/down (depending on the call/put) and... dang. Going back in! I perfectly timed the trend reversal, but not the direction. 

And exactly - I then pause. Go in in a good moment. Exit. And repeat like a moron
If I realized 1k loss on stock A and realized 1k gain on Stock B. I still have to pay taxes on stock B, correct?

I remember discovering them after it became an open secret that their platform is what tracked down bin laden for seal team 6 lol
Of course, It looks like a great tool and I appreciate the share, just thought it was amusing you picked 4 examples that combined didn't prove its worth. Thanks for the contribution to us little guys.
Well I didn’t make the post before today I made it after. You buy when it’s down 6%. I mean obviously unless you think it’ll continue down, which I don’t.

No and Elon isnt a fan of SPAC's and given SpaceX's declaration of Martian independence its unlikely they will ever go public unless they absolutely have to.
Instead of keeping stack of cash, just invest all of it in SPACS at nav price. Best case scenario you have some great surprises. Worst case scenario, notbing bad happens.

it's an interesting idea, I tried a few stocks but most of them seem to underperform buy-and-hold strategy, still dropped a star tho
Woah that’s the lowest cost basis I’ve seen on here lmao. Sorry for all the questions but where’d you hear about nio so early and what made you think it was a good buy at a time when they were nearly bankrupt? 
I had some great gains on nio too but I got in at $21
I would have rather fought in WW2 than invest in BABA

Spike proteins don’t seem to be mutating much, should be good.
Pretty sure there’s pics of burry getting in at 12-14 too. He added. At least that’s what I’ve seen lately. Burry holding long is the good thing for options. If options are trading on options’ momentum alone a lot of ppl are gonna be fucked regardless of stock price. For retards: Burry isn’t holding long because he thinks it’ll go down. Options wouldn’t help otherwise.

My p/l doesn’t matter to me once I enter the trade. But I try to keep the loss to potentially 20%, and I try to hold as long as I can.

Idk if y’all have noticed but Elon Musk and the guy who own Tesla kinda look alike. Just a thought tho.
Nice!  Up 328% on the 4/16/21 25C's.  Think I may go for more soon.
Procure at 600, sell @ $750
Market does react immediately. That is true and the reason why the stock is down 30% from ATH, but to say they're getting delisted means 3 years have passed and they've not proven their financial reports. As much as china is shit at doing financial due diligence the point is there are 3 years of doubt left and given a delisting is now somewhat priced in, the risk reward seems worth it. Any slight positive news means a jump.

Alibaba is not big and stable? Ali baba which was about to IPO the world's largest financial firm isn't big...? And has been growing at least 20% average since inception. How is that not stable?

Authorities definitely want a part of the company if not oversight (at the minimum). Which Jack seems to be coming to terms with. Which parts, and how quick they are handed over is a matter of results from the probe. Can take a year too.

This sounds great and all, but at the end of the day it's still investors driving the stock price.  Without news of absolute destruction of the company, the numbers are going to get people to buy back in after they got startled this morning.  Either way, I bought Jan 29 c 215's and Mar 19 c 230's when the stock found support at 215 today.  Been nothing buy up since.  Going to make a fortune off those if this doesn't snowball, and even if it's messy for a while, this is a stock that traded at nearly 400 a share in the past year and the financials have only gotten better since.

Now a lot of the new people here see this sub get mentioned on his show and start calling him daddy. He was hating on wsb until it started making him look stupid so he changed his tune.

If you really want to pump and be like the media, change your Title to “NIO reaches deal to increase charge stations by 100%”.  Then in very small writing mention how they now will only have 200 charge stations.

I really don't understand your logic here.  If you wouldn't touch calls, I'm assuming that means even ATM calls, so that means you are generally bearish on the stock for at least the next few months and think it has a very high likelihood of going down, hence no calls.  But then why shares during this time?  If you are sure it is going down further, and you don't want to have your money tied up in calls, you are ok with have 10 times as much money tied up in shares that you believe are going to be cheaper for you to buy a couple months from now?

Great advice. 

I actually was not doing a lot of options, but laveraged CFDs that I paperhanded. Also usually trades after I got some good results - textbook greed to be honest.

I have 2 accounts. One for long term investments (which is doing ok. I lost tons on Wirecard, but that was special), and other for swings or daytrades. I keep the accounts separated so I'm not yoloing my long term buys. 

Guess which one is the trouble kid? 

I gotta get my shit together and stol daytrading and do more swings actually waiting for good accession, not forcing the recovery. 

I when I lost 4k I wanted to get it back quickly and her ei am. 8k loss in 4 days
To remind people like Jack Ma CCP is the boss, to show other companies they need to play by CCPs rules. China is at a pt where they are taking the lead the many fronts and this is a show of power.

Puts were significantly higher priced in SPY last week and then Monday opened with a sharp crash, after that the put/call price difference was much better balanced. QS puts have been significantly skewed for a good time now and the sell off is definitely coming, question is will you be out before it eats all your gains or are you going to diamond hand your 5-digit gains into 4- digit gains.

Holding on with you my man, I’m not about to lose 1k like that. I’ve been in so many positions where I exited at a loss due to an overreacted sell off and each time I regretted it later when I saw the stock jump back up. Alibaba is a giant in China e-commerce, and I’m pretty sure it’ll go back up once this crap is over. The market is just overreacting right now and just selling the news but soon it shall go back up. It’s just about time and patience and averaging down now.
Y u being a  𓂸?
Skimmed it. Essentially uses technicals on moving averages and one or two other technicals. If stock is going up and it just did A. Buy. If stock is going down after doing buy= sell. 

Just add the technicals to your chart and tell yourself to buy and sell when it hits the same conditions. That’s the hard part. It’s easier if a program tells you to do it. Less emotion.

He timed this right but he lost out of the gme run. This first boost GME had to 16 on like Monday he sold. I know this because he went into stic with 1.4 mill but his position of gme was worth 1.7 mill when it almost touched 20 before earnings in like late November I think.
I went all in on GME today, I don’t know what to think
You might be onto something. That’ll help me forget my losses. Two birds with one stone.

Someone mentioned it in here already but it would be so dope if you could add friends on Robinhood and watch their accounts in real time.
My VXX calls are down 75%🥶😈
For example:

I bought $22c 4/16 for $2.85 per share, or $285 total. This gives me the same exposure as owning 100 shares.

If the price does not reach $22 by 4/16, I lose it all (unless I sell early - same as shares). For every dollar over $22 (called the delta, in options trading), I make $62.

To buy shares, I'd need to put up $2200 vs $285 for options.

Happy holidays. Hope this helps. Check out Adam's videos.
The ICLN train is printing nicely.  Check it.
There’s one thing that has been unclear - and is unclear in this post - about the tontine structure.

For now, there is no disincentive to sell, because the 2/9 warrants follow the stock, correct? If I get them when I buy shares, I get them when I sell shares too, right?

So when does that change?

My understanding - someone please correct me when I’m wrong - is that it changes on the merger date, after which the warrants are lost (redistributed) if shares are sold.

Thoughts? Corrections?
What the hell is this blue shit? Is that advanced mode or something?

I have been working in beginner mode (red) but hope to get to intermediate (green) soon.
yea jan gonna be fun with the spikes.
1. Irrelevant. The market reacts to real and perceived risk.

2 & 3 & 4. Chinese companies are highly competitive and the big stable ones are invariably government owned and run by Communist Party Members. Alibaba is none of these, meaning there are a lot of powerful people that stand to gain from Alibaba's fall. The immediate public shenanigans are anti-trust laws, as that is one of Beijing's rules they only enforce against private ventures. But the real struggle is behind the scenes, as the authorities will want part state ownership and/or party members in executive positions.

5. A US anti-trust case only entails the breakup of the company, and the courts move MUCH slower here than in China. Whatever risk there is hasn't been priced in.
I mean we do realize we’re in bubble territory right? I haven’t played the market long enough to see historical similarities, but I’m pretty sure it’s not normal to see everyone around you making money. I’m up $300k (389%) on the year, and i have been known to eat crayons
$216 right here
I did, leaps
I use interactive broker.  Sometimes I can get filled at midpoint, sometimes I have to pay a few ticks above the midpoint to get filled
As long as it's a realized loss, if you haven't sold you can't consider it negative.
lol go ahead and look at the recommended stock u tard. AGNC hasn't out performed the SPY over the last 10 years, even before the covid crash

sure it has a 9%+ divided but loses value each year

since inception it loses 2% a year in value, if you bought after it ran up in 2009 you'd be pissed at the return

What time frame is this?
Q4 is going to generate a couple bucks per share. 

I don’t think shorts can withstand a 5~10% buyback. That’s a squeeze 

On the other hand, if boomer management wants to pay a boomer dividend shorts will be forced to pay that dividend.

Because shorts borrow from long1 to sell to long2 now we have two holders waiting for a div and shorts must honor that by using their own money.

I think management is planning on option 2. Placing a shelf offering and paying a fat ass dividend. Forcing the squeeze, diluting Cohen as a side effect and recouping the $$$ of the payed dividend.

Either way, it’s fireworks.

Enjoy your confirmation bias and happy whatever the hell you celebrate.

Back to my original point though...

You said you could turn $300 into $5K so roughly 17x.

But the stock price would actually need to hit $26.19 for you to see that type of return. If it hit $25 even you'd only make $$$ by selling early in the day for a much lower premium than what an on the money call would garner two days ago.
lol only 100
GME will probably move faster than PLTR in the short term.

PLTR is a long term buy and hold that will eventually pay bigly but could take some time

So get GME April calls and then add PLTR shares or leaps when you can

If you know an employee they can sell to you, or you can find a broker to set up a transaction, or you can join a fund that's trying to buy shares at the next fundraising round, or you use a secondary sales platform like EquityZen or Forge. The minimum investments tend to be high, and you generally have to be accredited ($1M liquid).
In on this, too. Hoping it can return to the $8-9 range within the next year or two.
Nice work BILL
Imagine giving medical advice on wsb
thats basically wsb too though
Thank you. But not a decade. I almost have enough from 6 months of stock trading to pay it back off now. ☺️☺️
I’m 10,000 stonks deep at 21 average price. Sucks that we keep hitting resistance at 30. It is, what it is. Long term hold.
How is everyone feeding their addiction with the market closed?
Is Monday the time for BABA leaps?
You're making money?!
Same thing happened with Nikola when it came crashing down from $60 to before $30, put prices were insanely high, so it's definitely coming.
not in cali, banned
MT is a slow mover. It's not EV / battery, so you have to buy long dated calls and be patient. Good luck fellow loser. Happy holidays.
Well thought out, honest, and wise. 

Downvoted.
I have 10 watchlists, grouped intentionally and I see for a fact some stocks are removed. In my Excel worksheet, all stocks are present so I audited the lists and they are indeed missing. This nerd is fuckin pissed
that’s excellent returns! why do you pick SPX over SPY?
Did you make the 900? I got that 325 in the pocket and rotate back into BABA.
Happened to me a few months ago
What you mean
$BIIB $GILD $REGN $VRTX looks cheap to me. Not sure they're taking over Gilead, but if they will, I hope I'll be in (as I was in when they announced Celgene and Allergan buyouts)...
If you bought this today or pre-special dividend it is a long term hold. Don’t sell out at 100% gains or you will be like me when it was 1.50 sold at 3.00 only to watch it get a $2 special div. Buy, hold and see where it goes. They provide engines for military and civilian aircraft, and I believe they have parts in the Meteor air to air missile which will become the missile of choice for every Asian military excluding China into the future(fast af and long ass range). They are a good long hold, as in 10+ years. Make sure you reinvest their dividends because their dividends are misleading due to the number of special dividends they have been paying out.

Just because one that shit alters your dna 🧬 and long term side effects ie 2-3 year have not been seen due to expeditious nature of the rollout. Only benefit to taking the vaccine I can see is if you are hoping for a black swan and getting super powers from altering your dna

Holy shit, this article makes this sub look like geniuses.

I know all of this. I’m saying it should be put in a DD post.
Started the week with a spy short which paid off, then went in heavy microvision, fubo, and had some holds on thcb and cgro. Basically everything went perfect but the first two positions pooped the pants bigly as of yesterday morning
Futures are fun too
Alot to consider i have explanations for each of them and thats what i love about it. I dont get in because i think im early i got in because i genuinely believed they were extremely undervalued and held. I could also say luck but luck is when oppourtunity meets preperation
Again this is correct. We have two groups one says don’t use dividends unless you need the income, use a growth price that carried more, as the name was give , SPY. 

It’s obvious these days there are two groups in this sub. Those that work a lower income job, and those with high end paying jobs. 

The comment of holding the dividends goes more with the original poster. Homeless 3 years ago. If one was homeless three years ago stability is what one needs. 

I would hazard to say you have stability, and an income large enough to hold your own. That’s fantastic. Brilliant even. Not everyone has both of those.

 It’s obvious the comment wasn’t geared toward you or myself. 

It’s geared toward those here with little income and little to no stability. Paying it forward in society to get someone a leg up and shoes to stand in. 

I grew up in poverty. My family is still in poverty. The majority of this area is dirt poor except those that own the lands. The business owners don’t live here. *stands up on a soap box* for the benefaction of the impoverished, a hack to get infinite betting money.

On second thought, maybe it's true. Algo trading may play a role here. What if he jumps on a penny stock and we follow and the algorithms of institutions also dive in to inflate further.
I advance pay, I can’t deal with the stress of month to month.
Could this be modified to a CLI program that returns a simple buy, sell or hold indicator? You could even just run it against a watchlist exported or something. Then a user can just run it whenever they want.

I am not. The features promised by AutoPilot have never worked. The FSD package will also never work. 

Also, I don't try to allocate too many brain cells to know about random products that are going to fail. 

Elon has promised "self-driving" capability in 2019, IIRC. It has never done that, and it will never work other than in limited scenarios or accepting crashes in cases that people would never crash in. 

Who the fuck cares about lame features like "lane-assist", which Daimler also has had for years?

You want that I am not right, you want me to be some idiot that wouldn't be able to explain how the "top-engineers" at any of the tech giants are almost all in the wrong place, but unfortunately for you, I'd actually be able to design a safe self-driving car, but I do not think the technology or the people exist to make it work in a commercial product. I have made similar predictions since the first day any kind of self-driving was announced and none of the reasons that existed then, have changed. 

I understand there is a vehicle that can do 35km/h now and perhaps it will work, but it mostly seems to have been certified, because if it hits someone at that speed, nobody is going to die. The technology is probably similar as in Waymo and that too is flawed.

Anyone "investing" in this either just wants to track people more and doesn't care when people die, or lacks a brain.
not everyone can turn a penny into one hundred dollars

New season is pretty good so far
To add some tips to my other comment, here are some things that helped me: buy shares and stay far away from options. But you probably won't listen so if/when you do options again, don't buy weeklies and don't risk too much of your portfolio in them. Personally I try to maintain at least 90% shares, 10% or less options. And implement some other rules that force you to stop/reevaluate/learn more etc if you're losing too much (whatever that means to you). 


Also margin has been really helpful but **only use it for shares, and hopefully safe/long term ones**. Going crazy with margin can kill you. It's essentially a loan for investing so be really careful

Exactly it’s not about how much money you make it’s about the percentage. If you can keep a consistent percentage once your portfolio grows big enough, you’ll be a fucking king
Depending on you risk tolerance split some into ETFs like VTI, VOO, and maybe a high dividend one like SCHD (although I’m not necessarily a huge fan of high yield ETFs). Then find solid undervalued stocks in each sector and put some in those as well. Banks and REITS are still discounted (IMO) right now. Just make sure they are well-positioned financially. Of course, you could adjust many things here. If you have higher risk tolerance maybe some growth stocks thrown in as well, Amazon, Disney, ARK ETFs, whatever as long as you research them and think they have a good future

Basically a blank check company sets up a shell company with money from institutions at $10 a share. Generally they amass $100 million to $700 million, although some are now in the billions. The SPAC finds a private entity looking to go public, comes to an agreement on valuation/equity, and then announce an agreement. 

It’s essentially buying a mystery box at $10 a share and you find out in 1-10 months what’s in it. The shares are protected with a $10 trust floor, meaning that if shit hits the fan you can always redeem your shares at $10 until a merger is approved. Almost always once the target company is announced the share price goes up anywhere from $11-$30. If you buy around $10 you have almost zero risk of losing money. Biggest loss is opportunity cost of your money sitting at $10 while waiting for an announcement.
Exactly, it's evolved from meaning an autistic person, to meaning someone who thinks doordash is going to the moon.

There have been times where I got destroyed when market is more volatile than I accounted for.  Like post elections and vaccine news came.  Lost a good 70k there when the market gapped up like 125 points of whatever it was.

In late March I had a good run where I turned 120k into 900k
I miss being a child, when politics didn’t matter. Sigh
check my previous posts i got banned from wsb for over posting about GMHI/LAZR sub $15 lol soz guys

Your long term option is there.

You can sell weeklies or whatever you want against it for covered call money just like with stocks. 

Although you're catching on a bit seeing how that makes it a "spread" (mis matched). Covered calls aren't free money, I'm just messing with you. They aren't "slightly better than holding a long position" it's creating a spread that caps upside. It can't be better than a long. It's literally a strategy designed to "lower volatility". If I was managing boomer portfolios (I'd rather die first) then it's a strategy I'd employ to lower their portfolio volatility and generate income. Not because it generates superior returns.

Anyone who thinks it's "free money" always says they have a better strategy. Hence, it's not fucking free money, or a good strategy.
This is the way
If that’s your logic ZM would be more profitable
I’ll try not to spend it all in one place

Ey autist,

>Only a handful of stocks that aren't state owned go anywhere, and those that do come and go year to year.

1. The timeline to comply with delisting is 3 years.
2. Even so, Alibaba isn't your Luckin Coffee selling leaf water to turn a profit.
3. Alibaba isn't about to get destroyed in China either... thousands of small businesses depend on it to export shit to the rest of the world.
4. Speaking of exports, China, the king of this shit wants to get rid of the company that helps it get shit out of the country? Right.
5. Google/FB/Amazon are all being investigated for anti-trust, you don't see their stock tanking. China doesn't fuck around, when it sends a threat, it follows through. It did that with Tencent back in early 2018 and now it's doing that to prove a point once again.

Yours Sincerely,

BABA Bag Holder

With that logic I can say Apple may get delisted and their business model could collapse overnight and technically I wouldn’t be wrong because I hedged it with “may” and “could”.
exactly. i am long BABA with shares, but i wouldnt touch any calls or leaps on this. the tencent scandal lasted several months and i expect it will be quite some time before BABA is good graces again and allowed to rise. better not to have a lot of your money tied up in here

Best advice is to wait for a really hot meme stock (when you see like 10 mentions of it in a row in the daily discussions and then see mad prayers as it goes up and down thats it) and go all in on options. 2 weeks out is the boomer route, weeklies is WSB style. (go safe)

Nothing like the feeling of rolling into the weekend with massive positions on margin - 5000 shares each of PLTR, VLDR, GOEV, SRNE and CIIC to name a few.  Shitballs.  And my plan for the day was to get off margin and be half cash.

For fucks sake don't go all in if you ask this question... Get your training wheels with one contract
Uno reverse card
Here’s my process for a trade

1. Identify something that I am comfortable having a perspective on a direction, whether that’s up down or sideways, and also relevant to option Greeks.  
2. Structure trades in a way where if the underlying does move against me, I can exit for a reasonable loss, say 10-20%.  If I lose 20%, I can get it back on the next trade, if I buy a naked call and wait for time to kill me while gambling on delta, I could end the game for myself.

Examples 
1a:  I figured that Tesla would rally into sp500 inclusion.  I wasn’t super sure, so I did both butterflies with a high price bias, and a calendar diagonal, that way, if I am wrong, and it doesn’t really rally, I won’t lose a ton of money on theta decay
1b. I figured that post sp500 inclusion, the implied value on tsla would crash, similar to post earnings, so I held a butterfly the Friday of, paid 10.4 for it a 600/650/700 butterfly, and while tsla was crazy Friday, closing w a print of 695, I felt comfortable that there’d be some selling on Monday to get it back in range.  And on Monday I was able to sell that position for 20
1c. Going into Christmas, I figured there’d a slightly upward bias on Spx price and potentially narrowing range.  So I traded butterflies, each time trying to make 20-30% and adjusting as necessary.

Well IF they do then you minimum 20x your options. If they don’t then you sell your contracts most likely for a profit anyways because the stock looks ready to bounce. I’m only advocating holding these options for a few days.

If there were no “if’s” this buyout would be public knowledge and the stock would be at $100 already. That’s kind of the point of speculating.
Good tips thank you!

Try looking into more what I call COVID companies. Companies that lost 75% of their value almost exclusively due to virus. Oil companies both up, mid, and downstream are good in my opinion. OPEC+ getting nuked by Russia was a small factor but it’s mostly COVID. Occidental Petroleum isn’t going anywhere and will probably fully recover by next winter. Schlumberger is another like that.

Wells Fargo is another like that. I not only hold shares, but options expiring in June at $40.

Most likely up. 3 day weekend so people don't wanna tie up capital, get back in Monday.

It's not necessarily being bullish on weed stock in general. I think TLRY has bottomed out long term is all and I think LEAPS will do really well if purchased right now. Btw weed possession is basically decriminalized in even the reddest states.
Yep.. keep getting paychecks
I have.  I'm up 45% now all time
Yes but GME is a very unique case with the amount of shorts vs shares available
But the rules are unclear. In America, the law dictates what happens if a company does something illegal so you know what risks are present. In China, if Xi wakes up on the wrong side of the his bed then you’re fucked. It’s a game of roulette.

Honestly, I like Cramer. He just doesnt work for me and I know it, so I poke fun. BABA is down like  20% this month, but still up 3% for the year. Read between the lines. Once all this nonsense goes away, this stock is springing back up. If you can afford some long dated calls, here's your millionaire moment.

To be honest, all the know it all retards here claim to understand the inner workings of the CCP strategy.

It's a bit of a gamble at this point.

What's not a gamble though is that Baba just dropped almost $50 USD from its price a few days ($260ish) to $212 this afternoon, and is about to have its best year ever with near 100 billion revenue.

That is not going away any time soon.

Be ready for a rally back to 240-250 next week, but also be ready to hear more news on China's anal probe into Jack Ma's asshole, defining new lows for the company below 200.

I will be buying the dip every time we drop 5% or so.

Bought at 253, 228, 220, 218, 212.

Just think about the fact that Baba grew 30% last quarter...

Whilst I don't think this will be resolved quickly, don't expect Baba to lose 100 bil of valuation every day.

Maybe similar to steam but that seems like a lost cause since steam dominates and I don’t know what would incentivize me to switch since steam is free and game prices are pretty standard across the board. Physical stores give it the ability for same day delivery for online sales which is important for gamers (we aren’t patient). Also creating a community effect would be powerful which is what chewy did. It's key to capturing us. Gaming has a huge community and they can take advantage of that. But since this is all my mind can think of, I'm glad we have Ryan Cohen as the activist and me as a small investor

PDD is the bottom feeder, the dollar tree of China. You can get shit for pennies but you have no idea where they came from. They are not competing with BABA whatsoever, that would be JD.
They are protected by the UK they are a grandfather level company, they are also adapting to the modern market and with brexit over with finally they will only rise during the recovery. They have a huge upside potentially a 10 bagger from shares long term 1 to 2 years max
Hahahahaha I do forget this shit is an actual job to folks and keeping it open 24/7 would forever fuck them.

Eh, fuck it... fuck them... KEEP THE MARKET OPEN 24/7!!

Think it’s worth the hold?
Go on, elaborate 🚀
Good recommendation, I suggest you take it yourself?  

If you review the trades and what positions I have been in, it provides insights on one way to trade options that may be helpful.  But you can go ahead and spend all your energy on being toxic if that’s what suits you.

Go to Denver and find the sketchiest neighborhood.  You'll be the only one speaking english.  I don't know what it was, or exactly where it was, but I had some bomb Mexican food in that neighborhood and the service was spot-on.
Sell or else you'll probably hold until -99%. There is no scenario where you make your money back. Actually wait for a bump and then sell
I think a lot of people are going to be disappointed in the long run. QQQ & now QQQJ can be a great alternative with less fees and more consistency.

I’ve been trading options since 1999, so much of it comes from experience, and yes luck always matter.

Saw it at cathiesark.com and was like.. bro why

People on this sub are so quick to jump down someone’s throat, especially when they’re salty they missed out on the initial DD and saw it late after the spike. 

As far as I’m concerned, /u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT posted solid DD, got really lucky with timing, and is flexing his massive dong on us all.  Until I’m proven wrong, I’ll continue to ride with him.

I'm too late for that. Ps, wuts a call? I call ppl all the time and just end up with a tmobile bill. Think I did it wrong.

When it goes up
Alibaba may be delisted in the US.

Alibaba is in trouble in China over anti-trust laws.

The market has priced in that risk.

This sort of dramatic rise and fall is very common among Chinese private ventures. Only a handful of stocks that aren't state owned go anywhere, and those that do come and go year to year.
Would have it been worth it to you to hold at a even bigger loss for 5 months? No way you would have held.

2. Georgia run-offs occur. If Dems win, run for the hills. We’re fucked. Dollar to die, market to die, everything to die. 
3. Stimulus arguing AGAIN lmfao. Can see this not getting signed until Biden is in office. 
4. A lot of people about to get kicked out of their houses / apartments bc eviction’s can begin occurring again. 
5. We are just overall at generally overbought levels. Just look at the Russell 2000. Most managers anticipating 5-10% pullback. 

Personally, IWM $185 for end of January looking extremely juicy.

Why the fuck did my dumbass think it was the end of December
Ozark, Bloodlines, Succession, Black Sails, Narcos, Peaky Blinders
What’s your play? I’m balls deep in icln leaps 7/21 30c an 1/2022 33c
Ok thank you. Burry bought it at like $4 a share. It’s bounced back pretty strongly since then. He picked up the stock when it was looking it was going under. You are all picking up the stock after it’s significantly recovered to it’s pre-crash prices. Burry is holding it long though not playing the options game. So you guys are getting in in the hopes of a short squeeze. I saw the DD post saying it’s just like VW. Who in the fuck would believe that? VW is a auto company with fairly excellent and consistent sales and a bright future full of possibilities. The bright future full of possibilities is the part that makes a short squeeze a plausible occurrence. Good luck and gods speed retards.
Yes, I think it will be worth $45 to $60 by next summer. If Ryan Cohen ends up taking over I’ll double my price target and probably hold half of my current position long term
Ap❌t
I do. I'm personally holding April $20 and $25 calls, but I think GME will see above $25 before April earnings. I'd personally sell before earnings though because they've traditionally dumped after earnings.
Ur too kind. Robinhood means I'll get all the rich ppl money??? Cash money!
During
The cats been out the bag for some time - look at MT share price over the last 12 months. We’re now above pre-COVID levels
Literally exactly the wrong approach

Looks super fucking bullish
The parks are still very lucrative and by all accounts should bounce back with people desperate to get over lockdowns and restrictions. And their commitment to making so many new shows will not only elevate Disney Plus in the streaming market, but the Star Wars brand as a whole.
What you described is literally the situation that DCA is designed for. Don't do it if you don't have capital to spare though.
Puts seem too obvious. Therefore calls.
Succession is phenomenal.
There’s like no talk about it though. I’ll mention it to people and they’ll be like wtf and buy a ton. Someone needs to do a DD I don’t feel qualified though.
Don’t catch a falling knife. Wait for it to lay dead on the floor before you pick it up. 

Or go full retard your choice
Since you did it manually there is no real way to tell. And you’re not transparent about what results are on training data vs test data. Again maybe because you lost track because all you did was ad hoc adjustments.

This is correct, it's a reverse takeover with APHA absorbing TLRY. There's some bad blood tied to the APHA name with the short report and overpaying for assets so this seems like a good move to me as an APHA holder. Also keeping APHA management who have made APHA into one of the Canadian leaders is the best move for the company as well.

Can’t believe people thought FUBO was a good idea. ANother pump and dump. 8 channels for $16 a month? Come on ..
Lmfaoooo
I'm in this at least until June. The global supply shortage of all consumer electronics, including consoles, is gonna spread the extra earnings from console sales deeper into the year.

Also, if during those 6 months Cohen makes big dick moves, I can easily see myself holding for longer, maybe even into 2022.

And if squeeze gets squooze, I'm selling at $155, which is a 10x for me. I'm not betting on it though, it's highly unlikely...

PLTR's lockup period expires in Feb, so I expect a rise in Jan to make bank for the insiders, following by drilling when they cash out (note that the CEO is shilling the company in Jan, in line with the thesis). Long term I'm bullish, but take care you don't pay for Alex Karp's fifth beach house.

Don’t worry about it. In the time it took me to reply to you I could have explained it. We’re both fucking idiots.
Yes, but GM would be calculated on a sale price of 600 if you're selling at 600/tonne so the COGS @ 600 would be 480 for GM of 20% ($120) and markup of 25%. 

Or did that line mean you procure at 600 and want 20% margin so sell at 750 for the 20% margin.

Sorry just getting into this so not too familiar with the Corp finance/accounting terms
He’s pulling a scorched earth policy. It’s classic narcissistic behavior. Got rejected. Makes it about him, destroys everything and stomps off blaming everyone else. Lol so Classic narcissist.

Are you buying leaps on this? Can’t imagine anything sooner than a year will pay off big
Are you in just the ETF or also calls?

What are your settings for the MACD indicator in tradingview? Thanks!
Looks like a trainwreck.
I need some new tickers, I think mine are broken...
short term aggressive buying -- thinking march/april 240c? but then again who knows the chinese regulators? :O
NVDA pleas! You haven't split in over a decaaaddeeeee!
This made me hard.  Did you cry?
Never got into lethal weapon but will try again
Then you don’t owe a dime until withdrawal in retirement.
Ma isn’t rebellious and based on reports he’s already looking for any way to salvage things, I’d give it until March untill BABA is back into 260$ if not higher. BABA has institutional investors outside China too. Regardless of what autists think China can’t just steal your money and tell u to fuck off. It has a very controversial reputation and it would  make it worse by doing stupid things like what people are suggesting their doing. I bought around 45 shares of baba today so my opinion is biased obviously.
Nice dude
Yeah besides the virus of course the economy is usually booming and alot of it is to do with them tech companies! If you want a Country that is politically and ideologically very safe ( people here don't really care too much about politics.. If you start talking politics people will get bored very quick haha), stable and peaceful ( our cops don't even carry guns haha) , and veryyy friendly people then ireland is s great aul spot! Although the weather is fucking shitttttttt. Things have also gotten very expensive here in the last 10/15 years aswell  due to the amount of money in the country. I'd recommend anyone moving here stay away from Dublin its the exact same as any city in Europe ( but way uglier imo) 

Its nice having the government that will help pay for things such as healthcare, college, very good welfare support system etc.. Just makes you feel.. Idno.. Safe? Now because of that system we pay high taxes which sucks but id rather have it this way imo

Yeah haha our food here is just pretty much a mix of all the other world cuisines with some of our own dishes ( not many stand out Irish dishes at all lol ).. Like if I was to eat out in England I'd get nearly the exact same food as I would in Ireland! People say our food is boringly unoriginal because we just use so many other countries dishes but atleast as a visitor you wouldn't struggle to find the exact same food / dishes / restaurants  you'd find back in America! Today for dinner we made an Indian dish and yesterday an Italian pasta haha!
Obviously not
What you invest in?
Ban this guy mods. Spamming this thread with BS a bunch today.
Government shutdown coming Monday...
This one truly seems YOLO worthy.

Yeah besides the virus of course the economy is usually booming, lots of money in the country! Country is polically and ideological very safe, stable and peaceful.

Icln leaps are printing
Isn’t 20% what the S&P 500 has done this year?
Smart money will load the truck out of it on its way to 450 at 500 range if a major bad news kicks in. I know I will and Cathie will. I highly doubt if it will go to 400 range ever again.
Anybody else buy that SQ dip?

>scared

Yawn. Roll 110% of those earnings into $NKLA calls coward
This is fucking awesome man

I did okay! Thank the lord.

We all would’ve congratulated you!
72% is better than "nothing much" bro
How deep are you guys in ARK funds and which ones? I’m 60k in ARKG

NVDA really dragging me down. Need it to stay over 520

😂bought it in The beginning its nothing like 15 euro but for me it dienst count
Not gonna lie, wanted to fomo into something today. Forcing myself to hold off until the right moment presents itself
Time in market > timing the market with regards to shares.   Just buy in.   Unless the next dip is in the next month you will still probably payless now then if you wait to buy.

Stock price is determined by what price somebody is will to buy or sell a stock so stfu with all the technical shit nobody gonna start selling tesla down so just give me your money and I’ll throw it away for you
gains is gains, and bears can make gains just as bigly as bulls, sometimes more bigly. I don't hate the playa, I hate the gaybear game.

I really liked reading that.
Literally LMAO
3 weeks behind, i have so many pissed off customers
Lol someone recommended them at the beginning of the day, saw the gains so I jumped on board. No regrets.
Lvmh or L'Oréal are good
DA?
can you tell this to Jack?
Get you some GME in there too. Will be good to hold shares for the next 6 months or so
Haha too real
3 rocket ships..
Yes just do what I did. Buy 10K in Aapl calls expiring today and they triple and I don’t sell. Then i find out why they go to zero so fast cause the market closed three hours early today. FUCK THIS SHIT.
Long con
lol you know me too well.  Monday I start with shares
BFT and PSTH will be a quick 3x gain at least for 2021, I would prioritize them. Palantir for the longterm, it will be worth 1T by 2030 (20x)
$200+ easily. But PSTH and BABA also very lucrative plays
BABA 230 by 12/31?
My ARKG OTM calls will help me with my net loss this year. Dunno why I did it but it was thrilling.
I feel that feel bro. Merry Christmas
I work as a wingman. Hmu
1 share of Tesla and no Apple. 

Mostly REITS and options on EV stocks along the way. Try to keep it to under 2-3 contracts at a time and not be too retarded. I’m a paper handed bitch so I don’t hold too long. I’ve played a lot of SPACS the past two months that’s helped out quite a bit.

Biggest % gainer had been PLUG at + 850ish %.
Show us
Yeah I had bought them earlier this month, I took the 25% loss and am now in ARKG, got some 1/15/21 105c and I’ll end up selling those around the start of January and buying back into MT for April. Doesn’t seem like MT is really going to move much in the next 3-5 weeks
Airlines don't make any money bruh

usps slow as a mother fucker this year holy shit
Good luck.. I will sell those to you
I fucking love SPACS. Also buy Rolls Royce stock retards

It is pretty slow but I love the story to it. I watch it buzzed lol.
It already ended?

My guy, GME is what you need 🚀🚀🚀
Putting it all on the mouse. With the a covid vaccine soon people will come back to the parks and them announcing so many new programs, I see Disney only going up.
That's good vibes . Merry Christmas
I personally would sell, yes. If you want to bet on SNAP still you can buy a more reasonable position
I’m high as balls would love to start a new show so get some shut eye brotha

Not sure of timeline—insiders respect Hank Fuchs, who is their R&D lead. They specialize in niche treatments. I sold JAN 100s for good money, so the market has a similar idea about acquisition. Worth taking a flyer on long term
Your new mom should be QQQJ.
yea its probably not a good idea to invest in a ceo who previously bankrupted the same company
Having 40k to drop on investments in the first place means you're in a pretty comfy position though. Perhaps that not high-class for WSB, but that's pretty cushy in the grand scheme of things.
This guy. Last 2 days have not been good
Thanks!
yeee ty.
Hmm so i haven't done much research into the fundamentals of this company and I'm basing off this opinion on how mt got popular on this sub and just some quick look at its balance sheet.

The first post on mt was done by someone claiming that steel is rising and that mt used to be $240 at its height. 

A couple of red flags, this company already zoomed 20% in 2020, is not profitable, has net depreciation of 2 billion every year, has had a overall negative net income over the past 5 years, is super cyclical going from 4 billion net income in 2018 to -2 billion in 2019.

Also comparing it to slx, the biggest steel etf, mt has just been matching that etf. So why not just buy the etf if the stock performs the same.

Also you just got a splew of posts popping up after the first mt post. All of this screams pumpers to me.

I started investing in CL before the OH acquisition and I'm right around 100% gains right now. Plus Aphria and Tilray operate in Canada and will have the largest international footprint if they merge. The US is a huge market but its not the only market. If you're thinking of investing in marijuana and wait until federal legalization you'll be late to the party.

I am a beautiful retard.

That’s because being smart and successful actually will make someone a 9.
Same here man, steady gains all year long add up huge. No need to go parabolic, alow and steady is just as good. Trading like a pussy is fine, for us it's life changing money that we can make or lose, so you have to play smart. As the experienced traders say, preserving capital is almost more important than making it big. 
Congratulations again, I love to see it.
It’s gonna get crushed next week and January. Thinking it settles around $19-$23

That spike on Tuesday was an organic increase and NOT shorts covering. It was a direct response to Cohen increasing his stake in GME and putting out a very strong statement about protecting the shareholders' interest. He did put that statement out on Monday, but gains on Monday were halted by a short attack, so the 25% explosion didn't happen until Tuesday.
These smug fucks are always so stoked when they get a dunk on a straw man.

Thoughts on BABA 1/15 C 260$ am i retarded or nawh
Stranger things
I mean I was thinkin hookers, blow, guns, a boat, or sick vintage guitars.
Ma already has no stake in Alibaba. Nothing is stopping the CCP from breaking up the company, but it would bring a ton of extra work for no reason. Besides this is probe is meant to build anti trust laws which are long overdue in China. I doubt this is only targeting alibaba, we will probably hear about Tencent and others soon enough.

Oh, also, Perdue running a commercial that he’s been “totally exonerated” from that insider trading investigation. You see it at least 3 times every hour on TV. It’s crazy
I looked at it yesterday and decided against it, so at minimum +10% Monday
My guy. I’ve been playing this shit since it was 10 dollars. Friday’s are always a dump usually. Followed by Monday’s where there’s a morning pop. Then you have Tues-Wednesday where there’s sometimes a nice rally. 

There’s too much opportunity cost out there people are missing out on. I love the company but it’s the truth that there’s other plays if you’re looking for a quick grab. 

Good luck.

Trying to decide b/w leaps and shares.

I think shares is the way.  You don't have to fight Theta.  Stock can take years to break out.  

Although leaps, you are controlling more shares with lot less capital.   As im thinking, shares I think are the way.   Those ridiculous gains that hit the front page here are 1 / 1000.   The others are getting gang banged by Theta and Gamma finishes them with triple orgasm.
I don't gotta imagine bro.....

You shouldn't trade based soley on TA, but they're useful for identifying entry and exit points. Money flows is all that matters in stock price now, but a lot of times, TA can be useful to see when money will come in and when money will likely leave. You don't think that there are algos written with every TA that just scans the market and look for potential breakouts? Price support and resistance at the bollinger bands, SMA, and TA price targets happens too often to be a coincidence.
This is the way.
Adding up the numbers, buy and hold all 5 of these tickers would get you an additional $6.5k compared to using this algo. 


That being said, if you know of a reliable source of historic options pricing and stock pricing, I’d be really curious to see the results of theta gang wheeling options vs buy and hold

Nice! Seems decent but you need to test it on more than 5 stocks, could easily be luck. Also obviously this is obviously not a good strategy for larger sums of money since you'll be taking huge losses from short term vs. long term capital gains taxes.

Stop being a pxssy, borrow from your 457b like me and YOLO it. 13K at 4.25% with 120 fee for 5 years. Payment like $245/month. If you can't make 245 from 13K, I'm speechless.

> Should I pull out now and take the loss? 

Depends on your risk tolerance 

> If it doesn’t hit the strike price will I lose it all? 

Yes and no. At expiration yes, there's a break even price you have to meet or it expires worthless. At any point before, no you can sell it for profit/loss regardless where the ticker is

> Will I lose more if I hold? 

Unless you're selling options, no buying them you only lose what you put in 

> Sorry I'm new

That depends entirely on your financial situation and your ability as an investor. It makes sense that someone like Warren Buffet holds a surplus of cash and looks for a good buying opportunity. Use the  S&P 500 as your benchmark. If you could have made more money by just buying in and holding than having cash and waiting to buy dips then you probably have no business holding surplus cash.

I am down in Atlanta area for the holidays and it’s a very different climate here than what outsiders (non Georgians perceive from media reports). Outside of few cities, it’s all RED in this state. Atlanta and it’s surrounding neighborhood will vote for Dems but even among Dems, there’s a split here. For every 8 political commercials on TV, 5-6 are all Perdue and Loeffler attacking Warnock and Ossoff. Ossoff is being called a liar and that he can’t be trusted. Perdue running fear mongering commercials that if they elect Ossoff, Dems will defund the police, increase illegal immigration, raise taxes etc. Loeffler is saying Warnock is some crazy radical. it’s shit show down here.
He is a literal pumper...by definition

Yeh yeh whatever you say man, I didn't buy BABA so I do not fucking give a singular shit about its future and how far it dips. The sole fucking reason I even commented is because I didn't know /r/WSB was degenerate enough to have money in $BABA, even worse are the retards who all in on $BABA. Don't shit yourself in fear just because you all-in on $BABA and mad I'm exposing that shit you dumb fuck. 吃屎啦傻逼
Fug it. I’m not an investor I’m a WSB retard
They're diluting shares. He may be right but I think the risk/reward is no good due to the fanaticism around the stock.
In one month, you will again be homeless with 4 dollars to your name.
Ohhh this stock has been rubbish for a very long time, the way this company was run was aweful, execs flying around in private jets while the company bled money, multiple stores in the same shopping malls that both lost money, an AOL tier online shopping experience. Things have been turned around, albeit slowly, the private jet has been sold, those stores haven't had their leases renewed, online shopping has improved and their online sales have surged by multiples over the last year.
The bleeding has slowed, and everyone is betting on a return to profitability next quarter. 
It definitely looked like this company was on its deathbed back in march, these shares were shorted for a reason, but the company hasn't folded, gaming is in a boom, we are at the start of a new console cycle, and those short positions must be closed.

tl;dr it's bullish. It's just you will need to buy and hold shares like a boomer for this play.
My sell order got rejected because the actual bid was higher than what I was trying to sell at which lost me money in the end. Fuck these dumb ass rules.

Bought the BABA dip.  10x 300C for Apr.
I'm totally down with crashing world markets if it means taking down the big banks.  Especially Goldman Sachs.
You too my brown brother
7 contracts at $1.49, down 69% (nice). I’ve kind of been trading in and out of them though. So realistically I’m probably down more like 80%😔
I don't do options because I'm not confident in anything. Just shares.
You can buy shares in after hours pal
To the guy who mentioned in general chat yesterday the 4D Pharma spac:  

Thank you! Bought warrants yesterday after hours and today. Wanted more overall but happy to have a starter position. Had to research to figure out the ticker but I’m willing to take a chance on the technology
How the heck do you guys know which options to buy?!?!?!?!? Help me!

But have you considered that one good piece of news and the price moons?

I wish there was a good place where I could look up historical short interests data but the posts I read were claiming that the short squeeze could be at least like JMIA or SFIX
I just buy what Cathie buys bruh. I could spend all day researching but its not gonna beat her.
I know that... what are you trying to say “not true”???
ha, i can how that came off as me complaining that i picked up a loss. i should have been more clear, i didn’t buy yesterday when i saw the post. i was more annoyed with the blatant pump and wanted to shine a light on that. however, it is on anyone reading this board that they do their own DD before buying.
Bro why 😂

No stock goes up forever. Everyone knows it’s a bubble waiting to crash. One bad piece of news and the price crashes
Not sure if y’all know who Chris Sacca is but the guy literally traded his student loans with margin to $12m+ in the dot com bubble.

Then wound up $4m in debt when the bubble burst 👻
Up 137% on FUBO and the bleeding after hours still won’t stop... ouch.
When you have relationships with people that have insider knowledge, you both have restrictions.  
Not sure what part of that is so difficult for you to understand.

What position do you have? Premiums are just so damn expensive.
That premium tho
What’s your cost basis?
Online scalping is a humongous 2020, and soon to be 2021, problem affecting:

1. New Nvidia GPUs
2. New AMD GPUs
3. New AMD CPUs
4. Even new fucking Intel CPUs are feeling some pressure
5. CPU motherboards even
6. Yes, new gaming consoles too
7. a bunch of other consumer electronics

Main reason why? People spending way too much time locked down at their homes due to pandemic, so out of boredom, work-from-home requirements and newfound interest in tech and gaming, the demand for consumer electronics is literally unprecedented. Every retailer will tell you that - I keep up with PC news as I recently built a new PC for myself, I had to pay sky high premiums for the CPU and GPU, because the demand is outweighing current supply. Since I bought and built that thing, the prices of said components have increased roughly 15%. It keeps going up and up, like stonks.

Lack of consoles has nothing to do with GameStop, or any retailer for that matter. There's literally a global shortage of everything consumer electronic, because fucking opportunists are buying up 50, 100, 1000 units and reselling them for a fuckton of extra margin.

Fucking webcams are now selling for 5x, 10x the normal price you'd be able to buy them in 2018, 2019, because Zoom and Teams are everywhere and there's retarded demand for them.

That's why some countries are already talking about making the practice of scalping illegal and punishable by prison. It's literally disrupting the entire global market, which is already strained without it.

***Fuck your retarded, uninformed, smoothbrained "argument", you furry fucking, mouthbreathing, idiotic gaybear.***

Jack Ma is an incredibly persistent, hardworking and diligent person. He is also a complete goofball who everyone recognizes as pretty dim. The CCP have funneled both him and Alibaba into their positioning because they knew he was not ultimately a threat.

It took you 2 years 11 months to make $6000?
ETL’ing data into a standardized format isn’t something Palantir invented, but they have a neatly packaged product that makes integrating unique data sources into their platforms a bit easier. Most of the time, you would still need a developer to create those “hooks” into the platform depending on the type of data, but it handles a lot of the annoying parts of it internally within the code.

A lot of the appeal is the ability to search and give context to a piece of data within milliseconds which empowers analysts who use the platform to make links very quickly between two pieces of data.

Yea the less positions you have the more time you’ll have to research them and go in depth. Also NIO has a big event in a week or two and if there presentation goes well it could easily rally. Up to you man it’s just my personal style to never have more than 5 positions open at once (currently have 3)

Ok, so your post reports results on the training data. No one cares how it performs on data the algorithm has seen.

Please make a notice on your post that the results are on training data. Reporting individual tickers is fine but also report the test dataset accuracy and preferably an average over many tickers. The current post is misleading to all the dumbasses on this sub.
Has legs until it doesn't, unless you are holding for a year or more
Haha thank you. I’m only 20 and studying Finance in college rn. I’m hoping to make a career of this whether it be in Trading, PE, or hedge funding.

I’m going to allocate about 10-15% of my account to day trading options and with the rest I’m selling covered calls against $AAPL shares.

I appreciate the caution tho. Best of luck to you in your career, marriage, and life. Keep killing it.

I’m not him, but if you think the stock will be doing well 3-5 years from now, risking waiting too long is not worth the difference between a 110% ROI and a 100% ROI. At some point you have to just say it’s time to buy, accepting that you might miss a future downswing.

Not true. Retail investors typically dont short stocks other then buying puts because it is hard to set up on brokerages and most are not intelligent enough to do it effectively. You are under the assumption that retail investors are shorting but in reality it is big institutional players that will hedge there shorts

Nice gains bro, enjoy your tendies.
cramer actually suggest buying options? i never hear him say that
My sincere hope is that Monday turns red or mixed at best. Trump has made no indication whether or not he's signing the relief bill, and Monday is the last day before a potential shut down. I liquidated a good chunk of my portfolio and I have orders placed but they're not filling.

Then the market needs to go immediately green.

Yea. I think today was just a healthy pull back and some profit taking. It’s poised to do well going forward. Think I’m moving from a scalp stock to a hold. Gonna sell covered calls on the next green day and let it ride.

Most of his theories have some truth to it and a few turned out to be true. So exactly like wsb

You must not know Chris Sacca, he yolo'd on an unicorn early stage (like 10k users early). If I remember correctly it was Twitter.
But what if you die before the age at which you can withdraw from your Roth IRA? Isn't the money wasted?
Because RH can crash on market crash day so absolutely not.

I'm gonna be homeless when my wife sees my losses come tax time.
I never said it would be for free
I thought that too but I’m willing to overlook it because of how undervalued it is making it a relatively low risk imo.
Please charge your phone
Thanks for your concern.  However, to clarify, whether you withdraw or not doesn’t make a difference.  Once you sell a position, there will be tax implications.
Yeah that sounds terrible...they just get you in the door with the rate but it really doesnt mean shit. Thanks for the tip
microdose = little baby bitch, eat 4
From the 5K 1.4 is in nio I trust nio way more then fisker. So maybe sell 700 of Fisker buy even more nio and palantir?
Kind of nice to have alone time and no responsibilities every now and then. Enjoy the time and do what you want to do!

Congrats.  Yeah, i am also pretty heavily invested now, just always weary when everyone starts hopping on the same ship.  I've read everything Vito's posted and done my own DD.  Just asking questions.
Pretty solid right?
Back in the day when I bought my 970 UPS pulled the same bullshit.  I came home and someone was on my porch playing with the package, ran off when I got home (it was a little kid), and I emailed them and they said they were under zero obligation to do anything.

I haven’t been alive during a bear market yet
You also need at least 10k steps a day it’s very important, cook more, eat out less things like that. You want like 4 good lean meals a day that were actually prepared. Sorry I use to work at a body building meal prep place and telling people to eat less is the last thing they need to hear lmaoooo
Merry Christmas Eve, ya fuckers. See y'all next week for new year rally.
Of all the shit you could say about California it blows because they’re against non competes? Who in their right mind is pro non compete lol.
Chad buys the dip 😎
No
You can totally pay more than you expect. For example, nothing is stopping you from placing a $1 bid on a .01 ask. I constantly get filled a few bucks over my ask. I assume if I trade with tens of thousands I’d make a few grand that way.
I agree with all of that except you can’t target fat burning in a specific area. Crunches will burn fat yeah, but it’ll burn fat evenly throughout your whole body.
I don't understand why so many people use margin with such high interest. Ibkr has great rates, even Robinhood is now 2.5%. why not switch?
NARC ALERT

It’s kinda like The Lord of Flies situation right now
god i hate comments like these on this sub. take that shit to r/investing, stocks or w/e.

you see these millions gains posts? you don't get there with that attitude. seeing these "ok take gains and put into spy" on a 3 million post is at least somewhat justifiable, on 80k is just nonsense.

tl;dr: Sir this is a casino
What was your position? Sorry if it’s obvious but I didn’t see it.
ALPP has made my Christmas 🚀
So are we done doubting G(HIV)+? Or are we still hooked on the sexy girls in the room? I hope yall got in on the pre-holiday dip, might not look back from here.
100% for sure
Find a third
Either I’m a genius or I’m fucking retarded. Holding $375c’s
They don't have margin calls they just start selling your shit lol. 

And their requirements were insane it was like 75% of value for Tesla stock while I was there. Made it impossible to daytrade shares on margin. So it all looks great on paper but in practice it's pretty much useless since you can't really utilize it as much as with other brokers who are more laxed. I rather pay a higher percentage for when I want to use margin rather than pay a low apr but have barely any access to it.

E-commerce already represents more than 20% of their top line. They already have a deal with Microsoft in place. They get a cut of every digital purchase on Xbox they sell. And I believe this may be just the start. Besides, on fundamentals only, their current e-commerce sales (meaning without new consoles yet) already justify a 2 billion market cap

God damn this a great story. Thanks for sharing. Super happy for you man. Now do like me and get the F out. Lolol
ARKK literally pulled back 0.98% but that's a massacre here.
Just reading thru the WSB rules... Doesn't this whole GME thing directly violate #3? I mean thats literally the gameplan with this thing right? Buy up enough shares to force MM's to cover their shorts and send the stock to the moon?
They filed for 'being able to sell up to 135 million shares, collectively'. Does not mean it will happen. Seriously dude, this company will be one the front runners to space-related activities in the early 21st century. Think planetary science and traveling on Earth AND Mars.

Even if you don't believe in any of this, it's a bet (in a retard casino) on this stock jumping significantly once Virgin posts their failure analysis and new launch calendar.

Can you autists even imagine if SpaceX was public, the ups and downs during the initial launches (and huge failures)?

Retards be sitting on the sidelines asking too many what ifs and being generally skeptical of anything pushing the fucking envelope of human kind.

I just bought some leap calls today. 

I was shorting earlier this year at $260, but at $210, I’ll take a small yolo.

CRM got chopped up. No clue what that was about. Fund having to unload?

Also, new year means rebalancing. Might be some crazy runners early January. Curious which could be

Fubo actually tight
So essentially your trying to say they will never cover, Ok, short the stock then. Every dip forms into a higher high, shorts are literally losing more and more money as they wait. Sure some of the big ones hedge, but do you think they are just going to keep watching this shit rise and rise? Your logic is flawed
I’m gonna set this picture as my screen background so I can atleast get tiny doses of serotonin every now and then before I realize it’s not my account

When I checked Google it said -19%. Then ca 10 min later the graph showed a narrow V shaped recovery and the stock was back on -1%. Later that V shape was gone though. Don’t know what happened. Anyway, I think FCEL will do great the next 30 days.
Wouldn’t touch BABA until it’s clear that Jack Ma is in the good graces of the CCP again.
Merry Christmas!

Too lazy to look at the code but have you tried normalizing the dependent variable, I.e. the stock price?  This could resolve your issue with lower stock prices.

watch your diet, especially your fat and carb intakes. You’re probably eating too many calories and not burning enough. Crunches are a great way to burn belly fat.

i just saw ur post history

you literally are only holding 1 stock in your portfolio at any given time. 1 million bucks. all in 1 stock, no options. only 1 row.

im like the total opposite, 10% of your account value but i got so many rows of stuff cuz i like to have a little of everything, it's like playing roulette with multiple numbers instead of "all in in green"

CRM up 5 bucks from the 220 lows. If you had 300 shares that's 1.5k in a few weeks. 🐢 > 🐰 like the story 😂😂. Yea hope it can move up a bit faster. Same with BABA although that actually has to be through shares now with the IV.
Yes...because IV is very high.

Do you know what happens to leaps when IV goes down?
Nice! the absolutely perfect Christmas card!!
Drink less beer and more water maybe also eating less won’t help at all you need to eat more greens to speed up your metabolism and lose belly fat
Burpees is a nice combo workout. Also, jump rope for easy cardio.

Got 130 euro up. But think to hold it for longer
Jesus who are the idiots who got FUBO at $55-60? I hope no one here.
There is an official report of short positions put out twice every month by the NYSE. It's delayed but that's the most reliable. Alternatively, u can look at a single broker and extrapolate. People have been doing that with IBKR's data
Oh damn, yeah I've never used ibkr as a broker...only recently looked up their rates after RH cut theirs. What is this auto liquidate feature?
almost sold my sklz today. i will never sell now because of this post
So what’s going to be the next money making play? The past couple months it’s been ipo’s, spacs, and ev. It’s not going to work forever though

Ima give u some advice. Take it or leave it but it worked for me. The one day you take off - use that day to go on a hike. Preferably somewhere there is a payoff at the end. Go to Alltrails and just search for some shit near you. 
It’s not a fuck ton of serotonin or anything but it’s a lot less soul sucking then watching your calls expire otm. Just makes the 12 hour grind little worth it when you planned a cool hike end of week u know?

“Target became a prominent example of another kind of personal data vulnerability, when the New York Times detailed how the retail chain analyzed shopping patterns to determine which of its customers were probably pregnant. Target then sent them ads for relevant products, in one case outing a 15-year-old girl who hadn’t told her father about her pregnancy.” 

Lmaooooo I didn’t know this happened to target a couple years ago, fuck. Lol
Also, everyone's freaking out about 6k puts yesterday, while two days ago (Dec 22) there were 35k puts sold (15p 22 Jan 2021)

Mhmm one of the largest companies in the world, most dominant player in eccomerce and cloud servers is going to crash on monday and never recover. Youre a fuckin retard. Im done wasting my time responding to you
Draft kings, PLTR, Spotify, say hi
Huge level of support there at $20, probably why I'm so calm right now.
I'm quite keen to free up some more cash and put it in my account to buy those dips because at less than $20 it's great buying, I'm with you expecting it to trade sideways for a bit, things will get spicy around earnings. 
Huge potential for good gains here still.

Seems like you bought at the top but will work still

I have absoulutly no idea how to code, wish me luck! Keep getting synatax errors. Downloaded python onto my mac and trying to run what u said in IDEL

Robinhood showing my buying power is -50k
If you are into this to make money next week, it might be the time to move on and look into something else.

But, if you do have some conviction, then stop buying into the unlikely MOASS hype and have some patience. We might very well see GME go through a TSLA like slow burn next year. In fact, we might be at the very beginning of it.

This is a unique situation in this company's history. A lot of unknowns, variables and uncertainty, but whatever you buy now - shares, long calls/leaps - has a high probability of turning into a multibagger, because the company is STILL undervalued.
Started with 15k. Down 75% all time after today’s close. Does this count as blowing up my account? Or does it need to be 100%?

Why FSR tho. I've considered but by the time they have a viable product they'll be in a crowded market. They're hoping people are willing to rent their vehicles and that their shtick on the greenest EV will be a large enough economic moat to differentiate.

The best thing I see about them is their CFO who unfortunately has breast cancer. The CEO is an incredible car designer but he already has a history on startups.
Baby gains go in the daily thread, read the rules.
You can check his post history and read his DD. No one should be buying calls that expire before feb earnings, imo. 

I have a few feb calls, with the majority in April - June.
I'm giving myself time to be right. This isn't EV / battery play, where you'll see a 50%+ stock price increase over 2+ weeks.
Bought spy fds maybe meant to by for 0.01 and bought for 1 idk
Ibkr offers great rates but their margin requirements are so high you can barely use it. Not to mention their crazy auto liquidate feature lol. I swapped to TD just to avoid all that since I don't use margin much anymore anyways.
Hopefully PLTRs program will run and say “you guys retarded? The best way to run the IRS is to make it go away”.

good, I should buy some put there now.

This is solid Dd the problem is all these leaps are expensive like the July 35 cal is 4.20

Okay but I see a 100 posts a week now that say "remember when such and such happened and no one took it seriously this is the same", why would yours be the needle stock in the hay of hopeful wishes? "If they do merge" sounds like more hopeful wishes
lol keep telling yourself gme is a solid business and you're not just in it for potential stock market fuckery that could possibly occur🤣

think your over diversifying.. you only got 5k better to go balls to the wall on something your extremely confident about
Positions
You think that’s bad, look at what happened to pltr
Hmmm
1) not true. Plenty of stocks do not always go up (even blue chips). Usually the higher their dividend, the less chance of them going up. But yes, go long. 

2) pick a basket of individual stocks IN SEPARATE SECTORS. An entire sector can get clapped (oil, tech, etc) and leave everything else fine. Pick 1-2 stocks per sector. 

3) If you’re going long none of this matters. Buy on red days. That’s it. If you wait for certain stocks to trade 5+% lower than their average you’re gonna have that average move on you in a bull market. 

4) yup. Plan an entry and plan an exit before you buy anything. Is it a 30% gain? Capital loss harvesting? Long term Capital gains tax? Retirement? Dividend? Know why you’re buying and what constitutes an exit. It doesn’t matter if it keeps going up after you sell because you made a plan and stuck to it. Over your entire career you’ll win more than you lose WITH A PLAN
r/investing told me to avoid BABA, so of course I went all in because that means it bottomed out.
That's pretty good, but a great c-suite and bullish macro-trend is necessary but insufficient. 

For me the sticking point in their business model. how do they see growth going forward when most games are downloaded from online play stores and most consoles are bought online?

Why would China want to permanently damage  one if its biggest assets in terms of global commerce? This isn’t some shell company that’s lying about its sales like WMV was. It’s a multi billion dollar company. China’s done this to stop people like MA from being influential.

IB är de som alltid varit aktuellt om man ska köra från EU, båda för optioner och OTC stocks, Inte kollat Tastyworks, men möjligt att du kan köra med dem nu, Andra klienter som ThinkorSwim, RH, etc är off limits för Europer. 

Avanza är typ bra om man börjar spara i guess, Norndet är väl helt ok, fördelen är att båda har ISK om du inte vill betala 30% källskatt på vinster. Nackdelen är att deras options courtage är ett rån, Där är Degiro bättre men dem har inte ISK konton mer. Europeisk optionsmarknad är överlag jävligt B, Den är sjukt illikvid, så även om du gör typ 100% så realiserar du ändå sällan mer än typ 70% pga spreaden är så bred.   
Vill du köra amerikanska optioner så köra Tastyworks eller IB, håll dig borta från CFD's, och Bull/Bear certifikat om du vill tradea med hävstång.

Are you a millionaire now?
There are many websites to get it from. Just google highest paying dividend stocks.


Edit:.... the way I see it... 

buy the stock now for its underlying security that it will hand out an income. Now not all pay monthly, they each have their own payout.

Only invest new cash in dividends. What your Yeild in dividends is your monthly gambling limit. That’s money if you lose, you just won’t pay taxes on it??  Someone clarify that part about tax. So if you win it big, just reinvest in dividends yielding stocks again because the underlying price means nothing I’d the monthly dividend continues. If it’s stable, more people will buy into it for that portion and not the price trade. 

Only gamble with the dividends. Payouts only buy more stocks. Losses only count off taxes. Steady increase in profit. 

Maybe I over thought it, but isn’t that basically what gamblers would do? You want to win those bigger pay outs. Not take it out and buy some new car. You’d buy a new car when it became pocket change. Something you’d make in one week with your gambling addiction.

Disney did slap cheeks over the past few months due to something I saw on the news (too lazy to look it back up).
i feel attacked
I think JNJ might be like 2.5% off of the top of my head and it's almost impossible it tanks in price. Not sure if that's high enough for you. There's of course like JPM too as the best bank. Disney will probably reinstate their dividend soon and it's around 1.5% I think off the top of my head. The problem is if you wanna find a 5%+ dividend stock, that stock most likely will never grow.
Imagine being autistic enough to make those gains yet not enough of an autist to live in a capital gains tax free country...
Large companies are so shitty that they can't even get a report showing data from their Inventory systems and their HR systems at the same time. This isn't a technology problem though. It is because Tom the Database Administrator for the Inventory Database says that the RAM is maxed out and because of that he cannot add any new users to access the system. And Brenda in HR says that she cannot allow anyone to pull data from HR until her assistant has put it in excel and applied the correct fonts and removed the "Is Sex Offender" column. 

If you give Palantir 5 Million dollars they will come in and tell Tom and Brenda to both shut the fuck up and add a palantir username to every database then let Tableau connect to those databases.

You can deposit for a 6% penalty? Sounds like a bargain considering there will be no tax after that
Sold some (4) calls today 1-15-21 25c for 2.00. I figure if they get called way I made good money. If it goes to 50% I will buy it back. Either way I’m good will make about $5000 on the deal so won’t be too hurt unless it  moon shots in the next few weeks (one being a short week. This is where I hope to buy back).

Can you afford to clean your Deak now?
I need to just park my cash & let it sit. Took a big loss last week so I’m looking just let some shares grow and focus on other things
When you short you hedge by buying calls, that's literally what call options were made for. I have no idea what happened, but one of two things probably happened: 

* somebody hedged their long position

* somebody, in the absence of shares to short, bought puts to bet on stock price decline

Also I haven't looked into it, buy you also have to differentiate between selling to open and buying to open. If somebody actually sold to open that probably means that somebody wants to establish a long position through getting assigned (while also collecting premium)
I’d be up 115% if I didn’t try out options on CRSP. It just broke even last week. This seems like the perfect stock to do CC or CSP’s with. It’s got good premium and low volume
is there literally any real reason to be long-term bullish on GME besides Cohen? lol. I hold some shares cuz I am rehtard but I'm wondering what the narrative is here. short squeeze yeah, what else?

Debating just depositing and extra few k in to pass the barrier and taking the 6% penalty hit just so I can do it now
What's considered a dividend stock? Literally any stock with a dividend or does it have to have 1% yield?  If it's literally any stock with a dividend, it's MSFT, AAPL, and NVDA. 

If it has to have 1% yield, it's probably JNJ
I'm worried about what happens when the IRS starts using Palantir 😶
Look at all dat head, all dat head inside dat hair
So why would Tesla hire them if it’s so transparent?
GYNA of course
Looks like I had the right idea lol

Congress passed the omnibus bill already. Trump either signs it, vetos, or ignores it until the congressional session is over on 1/4. Then they have to pass the bill through congress again. 

The $2000 stimulus is separate thing now.
We wouldn't tell the cops if he decided to duel Sherman in the streets
We don’t do penny stocks here.
Unfortunately not, always have to do multiple buy actions when I choose to go in. You can sell all stocks at once though.
If you're in the Christmas giving spirit, don't forget to toss a few tendies to our boy who gave us [WSB Synth](https://wsbsynth.com/)!
You rolling these out bro? Or gonna just take assignment?
So should I leave this sub like the mods
Yea... hate to see it. feb 5th is because it’s after demo day and it gives you time to so won’t eat so much theta and you don’t have to deal with Earnings on the 11th + lockout. World will finally see what PLTR has to offer. This thing is getting held back and it’s disgusting to watch honestly but when it does finally go up.... it’s gonna run.  Anyway, I have shares and calls.. investing in the future.

SEC OPEN UP
That's great and all but it's historically not as good as an investment as SPY if he's just looking to invest safely for future/retirement/house or whatever. It's just if he want's dividends for some reason. Unless he needs more income TODAY he should just put it in indexes. plus another yolo...
Haha that’s gold
If your benis grew 71% in a year would you still call it a “modest gain”?
I think he's saying that your great-grandkids will be the ones spending all your tendies.
I work on the other side of the drapes and have yet to meet a tech who wasn't down to earth and cool to work with. You guys are awesome despite taking sh# from the surgeons from time to time. Keep on trading. If you're like me, you'll keep the gains churning in the background so you can give your job the big F U if they ever take you for granted.
thats why real retards have PLTR stock as well as options

Max greed. This looks like multiple losses on short positions. Were you buying Tesla puts all year?
What's the ticker for China?
Kids, unwrap your presents early we're taking them back to the store. China made them and now they're taking them back.
Don’t buy puts. Just hold. I have 265$ April calls. This will rebound in the new year. Alibaba is one of China’s biggest assets from a global power perspective. This is all a political stunt to get Jack Ma to adhere to the govt. honestly just turn off notifications and come back in a month and re-evaluate
After it ate all the cmg?

What is even happening with PLTR I feel like it’s gotta be the most manipulated stock out there rn. Of course I got calls on it
you feel robbed because you are. RH charges 2.5% lol
What’s a good entry for FUBO and what price can you see it reaching in the next year or so
I know. It’s like my kids.
Unless you have hundreds of thousands in that, you’d never know. (Also maybe you do?) Disclaimer, I am very retarded
Same here, though my dick is way, way, WAY smaller than yours. 

Which broker are you looking at? I am kind of into Interactive Brokers, but they require $20,000 minimum initial investment or some shit. I don't have that much, so now I'm looking to 10x my Revolut monies with GME and hopefully set myself up into a better platform.
Lol imagine being happy

Why doesn't CCP just flat out take BABA - they are communist, they can do whatever they want.
DASH looks like it might run next week
Cheap calls are cheap for a reason. No shame.. I've made bad plays. Sitting on a $360 loss $JD $105c 1/15 I bought RIGHT BEFORE earnings, hoping it would rocket. Needless to say, that didn't happen. -91%.

Live and learn. Happy holidays fellow loser.
I'm on my phone waiting in a line to get groceries. I'll do it when I'm back home. I grabbed some shares before close to support the troops.
You've got 4 months to lose it all, buddy
Investing is finding companies with good long term prospects for generating revenue and holding positions for years at a time. My current plays here are ARKG and ICLN, I expect those to 2-10x between now and 2030. 

Gambling is trying to play shorter term trends, take advantage of investor psychology, looking to ramp up risk for greater potential reward. Think scalping TSLA dips or doing a hit and run on the weekly meme. 

Unless you have incredibly disciplined bankroll management, gambling in the way WSB does is a near guarantee to go to zero.
[deleted]
Yeah I’m barely down. I’d even say flat. That DD is looking at irrelevant data. The world has changed in 2020. The stock market is a new monster.
The potential is there but it just so fuckn disappointing
For sure and I don't dislike his DD post giving everyone the investor deck. If he's still holding then good. I'm p bullish on the company based on what I've seen, barring some few fundamentals. Like you said before, we all need to take these posts with a grain of salt.
serious gamble with poor odds. good luck

You have to look at the delta to see how much the option will change with a $1 change in the underlying stock. It is also possible that implied volatility decreased, making the option worth less.

I read a DD about the market being down today. Is my app glitching because it shows all markets green?
Dip at 2:25
You’re an idiot
Revolut. Very nice for wrangling money in different currencies. Stocks are an afterthought there, but they have GME, and I've been using them for my personal needs for a while now, so one thing led to another, and we're now in this love-hate relationship, same as this guy who posted this picture.

 not actually true bro lol
Would def be nice if hyln stopped being garbage
Congress already passed the stimulus you dolt. Trump has to sign the omnibus bill into law for you to get the $600. The $2000 is not included in that and is a separate thing now. 

Basically the government will shutdown Tuesday. If it shuts down you’re getting no stimulus. If it doesn’t, you might not get stimulus.
I love your country!
Volatile stock and the market overall has been in kangaroo mode.

Find me an r/investing that turned 30k into 280k and 120k into 900k.  You don’t have to yolo in a manner that works against you with option characteristics.  Gambling against time is not necessary, options can be yolo’ed in different ways.

But I’m sure you know what you’re doing
It’s a boomer stock pumped by a boomer, they always move sideways
What timeframe are you trading on

No it wasn't
Use VPN to Moscow and buy from GOG store...
I hope so. 60% down
I love how everyone loves the 30 strike but I keep seeing the dates pushed back. First it was gonna print this week then for sure by the 31 now your saying February. I hate this stock and it’s prob gonna moon after the 31st when everyone’s monthly’s from the first spike expire (like mine )
ye bought back in too and it sucks
Most times being more than 3 -5 spots otm for options reduces movement. Same is true if you go too deep itm .

Not being able to call a person would stress me out with my accounts. I can’t even imagine dealing with errors with Robinhood.
What's the issue here?
BABA has lost 30% of it's value in the last two months. 

In order for it to reclaim former ATH at 317ish it would need to see 42% growth.

Do with this information what you will

ChYNA
Thanks for the tendies retard.
That's one strategy. Happy holidays.
Scenarios 1 and 4 are highly unlikely. Maybe a 5% chance. Scenario 2 or 3 will most likely happen. As for as market cap: GME P/S is .2 at the moment. Comparable b&m retailers like BBY are .6 P/S. That puts GME around $60 a share or $3B market cap.
Hopefully, accompanied by the customary coke & hookers! Thanks for the thought!

He’s really one of the very few “experts” that doesn’t constantly say the retail investors are idiots.  Pretty much every fund manager and moron CNBC parades out gives bad advice.

You’re going to get a ton of troll comments on this sub, but just invest in companies that you’re familiar with like Apple, Tesla, Netflix, Uber, etc. If you’re not comfortable with that, just invest in Index Funds. Also, if your stocks go down a bit don’t panic and sell them. Investing is a long term thing. Good luck!
If green energy is really a thing and coming soon why are Iran and China investing trillions in oil and gas explorations and drilling right now?
Google "GME short float", sort by descending, edge secured!  I wish it were that easy
Russia has nothing to lose. Their economy is always shit. China on other hand, their economy is intertwined with ours and other countries
if you can't beat em, join em
This is really good. I read your code and the algorithm seems pretty reasonable to me. I saw a while back someone posted a piece of software that scrapes WSB and performs sentiment analysis on it. I wonder if it would be possible to create an algorithm that scrapes WSB for a couple of stocks with good sentiment, use your script to buy low and sell high. We could get a custom WSB trading bot!
TSLA hammered my puts shit
Monday? Unknown. Is this the top? Probably not.

In the long run, if GME can carve out even a 10% of the gaming market and hold it down, it’s not going anywhere. Shorts initially started with a Blockbuster scenario and made good money shorting it on the way down. Now they most likely have to contend with a longer time frame. 

Regardless of a short squeeze, I don’t believe GME is in danger of bankruptcy. What you’re seeing in the price action right now is a fight between shorts and longs. This shit has almost completely detached from trading with the market as a whole, indicating unique underlying movement and pressure.
No I have no idea. Haven’t been successful in one  at all. You do seam a bit salty tho. But educate me if you will?
Bought at $16.90, sold at $19.00, thanks for the tip yesterday. Might jump back in on Monday, seems like a good one to hold onto after all. I just got nervous. My poor, measly, toilet paper hands...

Congrats on your excellent year, can't wait to hear all about the ride!
My cat keeps crawling on me and purring so yea I guess I’m dripping in pussy
I'm sure you all guys are autists-in-chief with pertinent opinions, however my one rule is to always go with my own DD and at times, gut feeling. We'll see in January, hope you all see ridiculous gains in your future 🚀 ❤️

It depends on your goal. If your goal in a group of rising millionaires and billionaires is to remind them that no matter how rich they are, they exist at the largesse of the CCP and if the CCP is willing to destroy BABA and Jack Ma what makes a smaller business or less influential billionaire think that the same or worse won't happen to them.

China has a bunch of businesses ready to step in and fill the shoes of BABA. Will it be a hiccup, sure, but a momentary setback in a vacuum that will be filled quickly.

They don't give a shit about an ADP in the US unless it's extracting money from the US to China.
Account is down 3%, but my calls are down 42% and 18% respectively.

20K shares at 21.20 + 2k worth 21 Dec 31 calls + 10K in April calls when that delicious wire comes in on Monday.
Man I never thought I’d end up reading this entire thing, but I did. And it was great. 

I can relate to this heavily. 

I started 2020 with about 10k in savings and only ever day trading stocks. I started trading options in February, but I’d never really breakout. 

In April, I was able to grow an account from 2k to 10k in a few weeks, but lost it all on SPY weekly puts (🌈🐻) during the recovery.

In September I was able to take $500 to over 45k in two weeks thanks to miraculous YOLOs of $SPCE calls and $SPY puts (yes I returned to gay bear- but it worked). 

Until it didn’t. I got caught up and lost 30k in a $SPY weekly position chasing some losses, and my account dwindled down toward $0.

I was on the verge of broke, but sort of emotionless. The numbers on the screen didn’t even mean anything anymore. I had taught myself that successful trading requires you to separate emotion from good and bad trades.

I took a break for a month and returned with $2500 in late November. This time I took a position in AA- Alcoa Corp. (not a wsb meme stock) I owned shares in my non- options account and saw that it was having a nice rally. I bought 323 weekly options for .10 and sold for $1.00 on op ex day. I had brought myself back to over 25k again. (Mind you I had a pdt restriction on my account all this time because I broke PDT). I could finally day trade again.

Over the the last month I grew that 30k to 100k.

I’m currently sitting at $100,000+ (over 1000% gains YTD)

My goal is to sit on blue chip stocks and sell covered calls against them for income (boomer status, but I would still play options- just not 100% of my account)

Your story really puts it all in perspective. Mad respect for sharing and I hope your wife sees a full recovery quickly. You deserve it.
Yup, theta decay. I had 20 calls that weren't worthless, but worth a lot less than they were yesterday (even at today's high). So not a loss per se, but a loss given that I was rolling in it yesterday and I could have made a grand more.

How beta is it if I’m doing a long distance relationship
Maybe text her to tell her you're long on PLTR.
Meme was mediocre, clip was fire.
It’s a market economy run by the state/govt, not a capitalistic market like the US. Market economy serves to keep the people productive and working, not for capitalistic purposes. Xi cares about the market so long as it keeps the people & economy going - without robust economy and work there would be civil unrest.

Last night, I did the test multiple times and all were negative. Tonight, I am going to do the test again because I woke up with a headache (another symptom of COVID) and feeling like I’m coming down with something.
Put it into a schwab account and buy spacs that are close to their listed value or companies that haven’t announced a merger yet but are worth less than the ipo value. Or Tesla calls.

The year is 2025. House speaker Nancy pelosi's brain jar has agreed with Mitch McConnell's new human skinbody to vote on the $12 covid stimulus package. This is the 37th revision to the package initially introduced in late 2020. One dollar will be split between all americans, two between all illegal immigrants, and the rest to Jeff bezos. Due to stimulus hopes, SPY has rallied to 600.

But I didn't sell at the bottom and picked up another 3k+ worth of puts at 216.

How not to be so retarded.
...and end up on a list
I canceled my trailing stop loss 2 minutes before open lol
I asked for help, got a DM and told them what they asked for then they called me a liar... motherfuck I asked YOU for help why would I lie 😭😭

That stock is headed to the pinksheets. Hydrogen relies on electricity to produce so it will always be more expensive. The only reason why it was attractive was the fact that it offered greater range but now with battery tech, BaaS and solid state, its less of a problem for EVs.  Plus they got caught lying about their technology.  It's a Theranos.
Sameeeee
I'm literally short it right now lol

Yes, seriously. Screw around with the rest all you want, but put at least 75% away in a good mutual/index fund, or pay off any debts to your name. Congrats on the gains.

I started earning $15k-$20k a year this year and I now live very comfortably in my 2nd world country, well below my means. To a bunch of you, $15k is a tiny seed capital, but to me, that's an entire year worth of income which can feed me, clothe me, pay my bills and keep the roof above my head.

Any chance you have other recommendations for good dividend stocks or would just checking the app be the best option?

At one point Robinhood had a huge error and costed me some losses. I complained to their customer support and they erased the trade from history.

So I got back what I would have lost if I had still been holding it. A second error came the other day and because I didn’t have enough screen shots this time, my $13k loss was my loss.

In my case because I broke my promise to myself to not get into any options positions to hold over an uncertain Christmas weekend unless I got a good buy in opportunity for gold calls. So now I'm sitting here worried about my options positions hoping they don't fuckin die on me because I went and traded something less certain than discount gold calls
this dumbass doesn't know there were companies in 1919 that turned to nothing
Well they were both bald...
I feel like it was just a low volume day. I had nothing big up and nothing big down. Biggest position is Enph which was up a little, and my other large position in Thermo was flat.
💦💦💦
There are other costs other than commissions. Like slippage.....
I guess in the end, the tendies were the friends that we made along the way
This all seems like great advice for a long term play. It seems like your contention is that technicals are pointless though, which is obviously stupid. Plenty of short term traders have made good money *consistently* trading on technicals.
Lol for real. This could have just as easily wrecked my life to the next degree. But I got lucky as shit.

I’m neck deep in $MT so just trying to determine if a hedge is even worthwhile. The only bear case in my head is if construction slows way down globally due to economic crisis and no one is buying the highly priced steel that MT is slinging. 
My Anecdotal evidence of a bullish play is while purchasing the supplies for a large chicken coop and predator proof run I ran into the following; fastener prices were stupid expensive and the welded wire rolls from “Gina” were backed up in port and also fucking pricey. Got me thinking about steel. Lo and behold the very same day I place the orders for supplies I see The Godfather mention his first steel DD.  Bias confirmed and next thing you know I’m 10k in shares and $2600 in calls.
It was bro, but events like this are unplanned and fuck up TA
I don't think its anything to worry about, it's a new ticker, can be volatile. I think when we get closer to Q4 results it'll be back up to 50s.
Pump pump pump I’m in bro
This goes against everything that happened today. Also, at like midnight last night I put in a sale on all of my pltr shares (26.53) the ten minutes later I cancelled my order. The market needs a ride through the year, too many big banks trying to make their 4th quarter look good.

Yea if your Dick is small enough- it fits in the hole you drill in your silver coins. When IRS see that behavior. They audit the next guy and leave you alone

You do realize that TSLA is 1.6% of SPY. Even if Tesla goes to 0, SPY will only go down by 1.6%. Lol

What made you choose MT?
give everybody personal checks! some gets spent, some gets saved (essentially invested so pretty much as good as spent), some goes towards debt which then frees up other money to get spent. literally everybody wins
I will always harbor a hatred for $QS until the day that manipulated shit tanks hard

I wouldn't hold for long without protection because I don't see how they plan to protect themselves from general collapse of the market or society. If you want to dump you can, or you can hold for a little while to get a better price to dump at, but if you want to hold for a long time you should choose between either hedging the position with options protecting against a price crash or changing your mind about holding it long-term.

Sorry to state the obvious, but that was dumb. You might make some $$$, but still not a smart use you investable funds- especially while you have other obligations. First thing you need to do is acknowledge how bone headed that was. Secondly forgive yourself. Everyone makes mistakes. If this goes south, money lost will be the price of your education.  It should be a short term problem, so move on to invest another day and live a good life. Another obvious statement, unwind the position as soon as you can. Investments shouldn’t keep you up at night.  Have a wonderful holiday and good luck!
LEGGGGOOOOOOO
Thanks but why ants?
Anyone but Robinhood and be wary of Webull, its Chinese owned. Everyone has cheap trades these days, no reason to go with the Robinhood anymore especially considering the stability of their system and priority of their trades.
Same I’m 60k in ARKG holding that shit

Gotta keep up with the times. SPACs are backdoor IPOs in which a blank-check company IPOs and then finds a target to acquire/merge with. They start with a base vaue (usually $10/share) and usually move up from there over time.
Oh I shall. I have no problem holding shares - saves me from myself.
What’s Celtx?
Lmao

They’re churning their servicing book because they’re usually quite considerably more expensive than all of their competitors so they can now but whats the floor for interest rates where they can still stay profitable? I would argue we are nearing that now. They rely on technology (other companies are catching up and replicating that strategy) and extremely aggressive sales tactics. In reality, a lot of their purchase business is lower end FICO first time home buyers because they’re one of the few companies that go down to 580 FICO and can close it quickly.  The purchase market is booming right now but QLs isn’t and People who have had more than one mortgage in their lifetime usually shop around and higher end FICO conventional loans and those considered more safe for servicing are getting taken care of through the wholesale channel (RKT is expanding in that but lower margins than retail) or banks. This IPO was a get Dan Gilbert excessively rich move and it worked well for him obviously but I would exercise caution. 

Excuse my typing and any mistakes, Merry Christmas
Some of the top threads on r/investing and r/stocks are ones telling you to sell BABA AFTER this drop. No wonder they never make any money.

I’ll prob withdraw jan1 or after for tax purposes.
Balls deep in ARKK and ARKF.
What brokerage is this?
There's a number of class action securities law suits being filed against BABA right now.  I called one of the law firms last week and they confirmed that options traders are qualified as part of the eligible class.

Amazing job. Please don’t lose it. Would recommend buying shares of companies with high potential and no risk of bankruptcy.
Yeah, those are my thoughts as well. Between Steam, Origin, Epic, Stadia, Google and AWS versions of Stadia, Parcer... I'm not sure what is unique about GameStop's position besides being supported Ryan Cohen.

Time will tell. But replicating Chewy for physical gaming products seems to be a pretty weak vision. We already have subscription gaming bundles like Humble Bundle or whatever Microsoft is doing for Xbox. Having a lot of stores is not exactly a "wide moat."

I'm also concerned with what happens around January expiration dates when all of WSB starts unloading their ITM contracts. This whole GME situation is a fascinating powderkeg and I definitely want to watch when it goes off haha.
Just woke up, what the fuck happened today???
Yeah I mean that has nothing to do with why people are losing money here. And tbh at this point poses far less risk than the ccp toppling the company

I bought TSLA at the beginning of the week instead of QS, I know that feeling
Jajaja I don’t play WoW. Diablo 2 when I was in middleschool tho
TSLA finna be messing up SPY returns for years to come since it's so overvalued... flat returns on SPY for a while.
Man I just wanna know if he dumped or not 😳
This is the way.
Because the party isn’t the only thing that has made China what it is today. Punishing one of the best businesses in the country is just bad for well, business.
The Virgin Fed
- Works from home
- Prints money at the problem
- Gets bullied by Trump tweets

The Chad CCP
- Probably drinks 1/3 the world’s supply of Remy Martin XO
- Evaporates 100B market cap from BABA overnight cause CEO said naughty things
- Welds people shut to stop virus
What are you referring to?

I have 500 shares also that I got at $13 so still not the end of the world.
Saw his post yesterday, don't know what STIC is and don't believe in the Bark Box concept but had to pick up 200 shares today just 'cause sir\_jack is in it
If I lose the gains, won’t have any taxes to worry about.

But to your point, I’ll be withdrawing next week and resetting

Lets have Elon speak Mandarin, see how intelligent he seems.
Yeah  I'm bullish on JD as well, let's just hope while Baba gets fucked it gives JD some room to stretch it's shit. Hopefully this mess doesn't spill over tho....
Not that i know anything about anything, but wouldnt it be more efficient to train a neural network for this kind of job?

Instead of just hard coding slope analysis and shit, with neural networks, you could also add some **sentiment analysis**, or any other information you want to the mix, play around with weighting different streams of data, and end up with a more accurate result.

*You could also run many instances of training at the same time, and pick the one that performs the best, something you cant do when you're the one doing all the coding.*
Cool, appreciate the info man!
I love FSLR, but they have a big weakness. They only manufacture solar panels and the profit off them is small. They have a large war chest but management fails to expand their operations or product offering. They are currently a one trick pony, though they do that fairly well. If they expand to Solar roofing, I will probably get in. Their technology is appropriate for it more so than silicon wafers. Plus, higher margins.
Holding shares because fuck calls on these risky SPAC's

We ride! To where only Tusk knows
Thanks for the quality write-up. Personally, I unloaded BABA, JD, and BILI this morning. I was up a little on JD and BILI, but my BABA loss offset those gains. 
I believe in all three for the long term, but I would rather err on the side of caution for the near term. 

Perhaps the main motivation for the CCP is to preemptively mitigate the rise of multi-trillion mega-cap, monopolistic, too big to fail, multinational, media controlling, multi-industry, tech overlords. I doubt they’re looking at the US and thinking how it’d be great if a handful of companies controlled their country.
oh my
Thank you brother. Merry Christmas!

Stonks go up, but sometimes they dont

Also, the squeeze they said tdy isn't the big 65mil shares squeeze. Plus, if ur holding shares, this literally cant go tits up cause there's a solid value play that has the stock trending up anyways.

No the days to cover has nothing to do with fines, it is the total amount of shorts divided by the average daily volume. For example, if the amount of outstanding shorts is equal to 50 million and the average daily volume is 10 million, it would theoretically take 5 days for the shorts to cover. If the volume would dry up it could actually be favorable for us since it would take the 🌈🐻 longer to cover. 

Anyways, it doesn't f\*cking matter, GME tot the moon🚀🚀🚀
True but he was talking about calls
Yea I totally feel that especially this holiday season! Instead of paying a little extra to the  local coffee shop they have a starbucks cup on their insta. I also think that most of this "small business support" is gonna dry up next year when the world goes back to normal. 

&#x200B;

I go back and forth on the personal checks: most people used them to save or pay off debt we need people to spend it!! Maybe lower the income requirement and increase the amount of the check to get the cash out into the system??
I believe that HSAs are treated similar to IRAs in terms of options - you'll need to get approved by your brokerage, I use Fidelity and am qualified to sell CCs on my HSA and IRA, but no other forms of options - but you can unlock higher levels of options. Just need a large account and to email with them.

That's like calling Nazi scientist who helped Hitler massacre Jews saviors just because they spoke out against the Hitler...

If stock goes up, then you're risk also goes up. Try not to FOMO. (unless its Tesla). 

Tip # 2
If stonk goes down, then start buying; stop being a degenerate and stop selling.

Im in big for 12/31 3220 and 1/15 3250! Let get it
Bought 2x  $222.5 BABA calls when the stock was at $218.  At close I only had a $100 total gain.  Was that IV fuckery?  Feeling like the gain should have been about $400 with a .50 Delta.
I may be red on the week but seeing NKLA just continuously die really makes me happy. I fucking hated Trevor and this fraud ass “dream” from the beginning. I wish I wasn’t banned on their subreddit :(

Hoping 2021’is better. Made and lost too much money last year probably lost 10’years of my life from the depression. Hope you’re doing well tho bro. This place can get dark fast.
I'm in your exact position. Should we hold and be bullish by Jan?
It’s actually FDA clearance for their 510K application that is currently pending. It’s likely it will get approved, and it is the appropriate approach for the company as the product is not novel. 

NNOX is far from the clear post clearance, as there will be other regulatory hurdles to go through for any future enhancements but it’s a really positive start for the US market.

Yeah it really is absolutely absurd.
ARK funds have ruined my sense of reality. G and K dropped like 1.5% today, but I'm sitting here thinking how I'll never financially recover from this.
Lol thats terrible. Hopefully you diamond handed thru

Do you know if you have the ability to trade options with it? Or does it only let you buy shares
By selling shares against a stock you own
Because it's a pretty saturated market with an entrenched encumbant. I'm fine if they want to enter the space, but they need more than that to squeeze these shorts with deep pockets.
I am diamond hands mode on Tesla cause I’m retarded

No need to lose sleep when you're going to lose the money
On average we probably have more profits than any other forum for investors/options traders. When Cramer talks about the the "redditors" he's talking about WSB.
That's just common sense, but go ahead and lose 100k in 3 minutes which was your life savings and lemme know if you brush it off as easy as you did just now.

You’re on r/wsb and you haven’t hit on a Tesla call yet? No wonder you’re asking these questions...

It’s prolly going down a lot more
Ok so you are saying the upside is $35?  Because that’s what MT was 2 years ago. I’ll take a 50% upside.
This is the way
They posted that article a couple days ago and it went down and came back to where it was within a couple hours, those bastards just wanted shares for the low, but I don’t know why it got hit hard today

I have no complaints with Schwab.

mix both. shares are your foundation, with leaps sprinkled on top for leveraged gains
If it's your first proper play take it easy mate, just get a appl/msft feb or march dated call ITM to test the waters, take the more risky plays on PLTR and shit once you're comfortable.
Nah fam that's a very high IQ move they ain't ready for that

If I wasn’t poor I would’ve bought calls after earnings, plan was to use weekly gains to buy further calls which worked 1 week but was killed by theta week 2, still holding at 90% losses, plan is to get into June calls
Yeah I fucking feel that man... Hopefully while baba is being fucked JD can find a way to sneak along the sidelines.

I did, did a transfer from the bank my employer uses for HSA to my brokerage. It ended up being a headache, the bank closed my HSA account which caused all proceeding contributions to get stuck in limbo for a while till I got it sorted. Funny enough, the transfer took like 3 weeks, and I ended up investing it all in index funds the night before the crash in March started.

Let’s hope, it had  a great run this last week and decided to drop off hard. I’ve heard from multiple people they expect it to be in the high teens early 2021 but let’s pray
Losses you mean? the price is creeping up, short sellers aren't making gains, if anything they'll want to make their losses this financial year and reset their positions.

3% gain. You must be proud
SHIP IT!
yeah i'm sure some are definitely hurting i'm being at least a little bit hyperbolic. i'm just sick of seeing all these people on twitter who surely don't patronize small or local businesses bitching about the government not helping them. lots of the businesses being propped up are businesses that were struggling anyways, personal checks to citizens would be a better use of funds than that.

Got fucked on BABA but bought more on the dip.
I mean sure but you’re gonna have to place calls out pretty damn far I thought we’d have reached 25 by now but I guess the fuck not, I’m buying leap ‘23s

What happened to the post that said "  They're making great fast charging batteries and bringing them to the market in the next 1-2 years. Thinking" etc.?
Shorts have been covering for the last year and a half on GME. Its part of the reason why weve gone from 3$ - 22$.

And its also the only reason GME has frequent up weeks of + 20% then down weeks of -20%. Thats not sign of a healthy normal stock, and its pretty easy to see mini short squeezes just by watching volume/candle activity. 

Some shorts have already been covering this week, all that happens is that they cover, GME moons, volume dies down then they drive down the price again. Short ratio has been very low these past weeks (only 35%). 

This has been GME like clockwork if anyone has actually been playing this stock for the last 5-6 months and Im sure even longer because I started around august/sep

Stop expecting a short squeeze like volkswagen or whatever chart you looked at. Without RC doing an insane full on takeover and if he doesnt then theres virtually 0 chance of that (might as well play lotto tickets then and lose money lul)

Just buy leaps(4-5 months min), and some shorter dated options(1-2 months) so you can buy the dips and sell the rips. What do you think /u/deepfuckingvalue has been doing? Go track his posts, I remember before earnings retards here were saying 'This IS aLL oR nOThing. RC wILL AnnOUNce A tAKEovER duRING the CALL' and meanwhile he was closing positions taking profit because he knows how the game is on this stock.

Anyone able to port an HSA account to a brokerage from your work account? Hopefully with option privileges?  My standard account offers some boring etf investments but I’m trying to turn it into a yolo account
Market should be open all day everyday. I need a constant influx of dopamine.
Only down 45k on BABA. Could be worse. Thank god my 12k PI*C shares at 10.4 printed this week
Yeah this sub is actually a Cramer fan page. We’re just emotionally stunted and can only convey positive emotions through adolescent teasing.
Looking back, I took profits and sold a bit early. Whatever, we’re doing well anyway and you can’t do everything perfectly.
CCP may not like Ma but Ma is not the CEO anymore. I don't think this fundamentally changes much for BABA. That said, it might take longer than expected for BABA to recover but you never know, next earnings might be record quarter.

I also think this is a risk worth taking. It's about probabilistic thinking - is there more upside at this point or more downside? To me with most US growth stocks, upside is limited at this point because they have grown as much as any stock could grow in the last 9 months. BABA however, is almost negative year over year. This might be a big opportunity in the long run.
Yo AMZN NEEDS to step up soon or I’m fuk
I've had 5 of these this year alone
SEC is on his ass for sure lol 😆

Short it then, time wizard
robinhood held up two of my put options on this last night, because “market price” is apparently too limiting at open..

so mad lol, but i should know better.. short term i think baba has room to go down, it’s china..
You should do ccs then, what's stopping you?
I’m just yankin your chain haha. I think that’s a good strategy in your Roth man, you don’t always have to be fully vested IMO

Its gonna cool off soon. 4h MACD looks to be crossing into a bearish trend today. Last run did the exact same thing. Put a buy limit at $18-19 which should go off somewhere next week. If identical to the last run, should go to $16 in the next two weeks then a run up from there. Put half next week, half week after.

I mean - yea. that argument can be made.  But we also have historically low interest rates which Jpow promised would remain untouched for years.  It's basically a play on boomers refi'ing their suburban homes.  Certainly not on younger gens who generally lack the funds to put up a down payment or the job security that lenders demand.

For people who want to get into TSLA, but you’re sacred:

Tesla is a good buy ( for long term) no matter how expensive it is now(wait for dip tho). I see so many Tesla in Hong Kong today. I always knew Tesla is quite popular here(not a household name, but often mentioned in local forums) but I did not expect Tesla to be EVERYWHERE. Considering the fact that Tesla is not cheap, and there are so many cheaper options, seeing that many Tesla is mind-blowing. Can’t say for sure but buying Tesla dip never do you wrong. It reminds me of Apple (iPhone4 era).

But if the market crashes, your money 💸💸💸.🤡

Different for everyone. Gotta meet your *basic* needs (not wants), everything after that is great.

This. Is. Not. A. Game!
Also, don’t rush and buy it all at once, like split it in 2/3 and buy dips!

What does this even mean?.. you honestly believe PLTR will see no growth going forward? Or is it because it doesn’t “moon” every week?

Ended down for this week. Not ideal. Thanking my lucky stars I had zero BABA. The fuckery of SQ, PLTR, and SE was a force too great to fight this week. Most calls at least 2 months out, so praying.
Only the people who have bought shorter term options will likely have to cover. I’m willing to bet that most of the people who went short on GME have probably bought contracts with a farther DTE than most people here expect
He owns 97k shares and there has roughly been 4.6m shares traded today alone. You really think his post can move mountains? Did you even realize the CEO went on CNBC and posted about barkbox going public with all of the other pet supply tickers up on the screen making this SPAC look really cheap and undervalued? Naturally people got in thinking they were hearing about it first on CNBC after hours and premarket hours and Jack got incredibly lucky. Hats off to him for doing his DD and picking solid times to switch positions. It's worked for the last 10 months and will hopefully keep on working.

that being said our online sales have 3x'd this year which is great but not anywhere close to the revenue we had last year
Ah yeah my bad it is a margin account. 

Makes it even worse because I’m taking like 50% margin there to get 1/3 as good of returns as I’m getting in my Roth that isn’t even fully invested
I wouldn’t invest either. I was just in it for the earnings play. That went wrong.

teach me pls
u know it's been a rough day when ur eyelid starts to twitch
I guess that's why the calls I bought were very cheap.
Downside: business is heavily dependent on debt to buy houses. 
Counterpoint: near 0 interest rates for the rest of time 

Downside: low profit margin on house flipping, if profit margin gets big sellers might not want to sell to them
Counterpoint: convenience of selling this way is huge and will be worth it for some non-negligible slice of sellers
Counterpoint’: imagine if they lean into home loan financing ... nothing ever bad happened there right? 

Downside: it’s not PLTR or GME
Counterpoint: it’s leadership has the Peter “I’m literally the villain from bioshock” Thiel co-sign

Seriously OP, listen to this guy. This is a once in a lifetime opportunity and the odds that you go bust making another play like this is very high. Sounds gay, but calculate what you need for taxes, put that aside, do not fucking touch it. Then keep 10-20k for play money. I suggest putting this in a separate brokerage, consider it a fun money account. Whatever is left over, open a ROTH with a reputable brokerage and get yourself some blue chips/indexes with good dividends. Compound interest on 50k is no joke. If you play this smart you’ll never be broke again

Depends on the sector of medicine. For example, with pharmaceuticals these are often ongoing treatments, meaning you have a kind of 'subscription' for many of the most profitable drugs. Cancers and such affect large numbers of the population, and the therapy they require can be ongoing or recurring for decades.

Solving motor function problems seems to me like a one-off thing. According to the CDC, [only about 1.7% of the population lives with paralysis](https://acl.gov/news-and-events/announcements/cdc-research-finds-spinal-cord-injury-leading-cause-paralysis-united). Compare this to about 39% of the population being diagnosed with cancer at some point in their life (and that's just cancer, not other diseases that have pharma treatments).

If there's a huge list of medical applications, where's the list? I'm interested to read the list and be convinced that the applications are supported by evidence.

At the same time, I guess having the neuralink running on patients and sending data back might allow them to do neurological research that might have value in some way. Still, it's not clear from what's publicly known whether anything new beyond motor therapy will be gained.
You must have a lot of short interest with your investment firm. It would be a shame if someone took those profits from you.
That's cool.
Rofl at "it's mine"

For now.
Interesting that you say that. I have the same intuition.

It's funny, this move could be your big profit opportunity. Buying deep OTM puts as downside protection is very profitable when their is a big move downward. Trump transition presents this risk in and of itself, in addition to the other concerns e.g. market ATHs, stimmy issue, defense bill issue.

Good luck!

Thank you for the information, again. I'm watching for potential breakout with Schintzer. From what you included it sounds like that will happen. Thanks to your previous posts I did the DD and now have long positions in M T and C L F. It I think you might be correct. I think we all worry when something is pumped, some folks here didn't have such a great year. It's also been the tech and ev gods who saved many of us so non-tech takes time and resources from that mega-trend.
Good luck
Did you get the super chewer box they offer?
Did you use the past three years of stock price data to design your algorithm? And then did you decide the algorithm was good based on the performance over the past three years? Then you fit the data on your evaluation dataset and it will of course be a good algorithm. Did you have any sort of cross validation? Maybe try on data from 2000s and see if it still performs well.

We tested December 22, $20 support today. Passed with flying colors. $19.6 is the next support, looks to be even more loaded and harder to break through. Unless we get some super bearish, short-term, Sherman-esque fuckup, we will be either trading sideways or inching slightly upwards until the end of year. And I'm fine with that, this is a 3-6 month hold anyway, possibly 9-12 months - you can't expect 25% daily gains, it's not realistic...

Sell some OTM calls for 50 premium, make sure they are 20 or higher, keep your premiums, once you have enough buy another contract. Then use those premiums and repeat. By December your one call should be like 3. That's what i would do if you arent 100% confident


Infact, I'll do those with ya. I am getting my call for January 2023, but I'll ride with ya.. diamond hands tho. Never sell
My body is ready for the ©️hristmas 🅱️ow

There's no premium for covered calls. I do monthlies and still only get around $0.40 or less for close to the money.
best bet is to go OTM at the early point of a WSB meme train.

Yeah, I bought at 216 and feel gross about it. Hopefully I can dry my tears with tendies.

Back at it Monday huh?
I love being dominated but pegging is too much. She can eat my ass and finger me though while i stick my ass in the air like a bitch lol
He bought short term otm calls and expedited to hit triple 7s. Robby hood unfortunately feasts on these accounts because of their high volatility and zero leverage. He should just yolo the rest into something long term otm with a low buy in and hopefully strike gold.

Did you buy yesterday before close?
You don't think there's money to be made in medicine? It's actually a pretty great market to be in , because it doesn't depend on affordability. It's mostly covered by insurance or governments. You can basically "gouge" the market as much as you want.

Also , size is only relevant with respect to current valuation. Neuralink has a valuation of around 200M right now. If it goes to 1B , that's a 5X return. 10B and it's 50X. It doesn't need to be a centi billion dollar company.

There's actually a huge list of medical applications. And the capability needed by the device for the different applications  is not that different. It's about where you put it in the brain and the "software" you run. Best part is researchers are figuring out more and more applications everyday. They just lack a device to do it more effectively and in a portable fashion.
Why?

You make money on these run ups it’s no secret.

G H I V - will run tf up next week! IM TALKING GREEN FKN candles.. and will continue up until it’s January merger (a steal) 

I P O C - this is a bit pricier for calls but my F’n GOD this explodes 1st week of Jan towards its Jan 6 merger. I’ll sell on Jan 6 morning and I’ll buy back in once it dips that day.

(Honorable mentions: FCEL PT: $20 by end of Jan and PLUG will fly with its huge battery conference Jan 8

Let’s get rich. Don’t take this comment lightly. I’m up $378,000 since June and my go to style of DD and mentors are spot on.

I'm an idiot as well and just as two negatives make a positive, two idiots make a genius. 

I'll probably do something similar, but with OTM calls because I'm cheap.
I’d sell man. QS is wildly volatile so might as well profit off the options while you can.
BLNK is so overvalued
Alibaba intelligence more like alibaba inbreeding.... Fuk u Ma

I’m fucking killing it in my Roth. Up 17% since 11/4 with only 60-70% or less even actively invested at any given time

If only I was as uninhibited with my main cash brokerage account...only up a little over 6% in the same timeframe

The main lesson here is yolos are rewarded. Don’t be a pussy
Checked my RH recap just for fun. I made 840 trades between January and July. But more importantly, I earned 43¢ in dividends.
GME $12 on Monday you mean
Like what OP said, don’t 💎🙌🏾 weeklies.  Get ITM when it dips, take the gains.  Rinse and repeat. It’s the only way to play PLTR right now.
Reading through the comments it seems you retards still think stimulus is happening. How many fucking times will congress keep dangling this out there and people still believe it. There is no 2k coming your way, now not even 600. Everything between now and the next Congress in January is just a song and dance so that people don’t start marching in the streets.
Fuck DKNG I’ve lost a lot of money on calls that were like a dollar or 2 OTM with like a month till expiration and I would just bleed every day hoping it’d go up. Also don’t know anyone who uses their platform

If you want stimmy, you dont raid the Congress. You raid the Federal Reserve vaults
Oooooof - yes, but it has to be from the medical students in training
Bought the dip too. But now I feel like a commie and agree with op, so guess I'll add more PLTR to balance it out

Lol I hope not but- you’re probably right. 

To anyone feeling FOMO. Trust me when I say massive gains can happen everyday. Just watch the “trending,” Tab on the stocktwits app. A handful of stocks, everyday, is up 200% or more. Buy at 200%. Sell at 500%
Virtually everything was really down
If they are OTM they will expire worthless and you will keep the full premium. You shouldn’t be writing options if you don’t know what you’re doing

Everyone is sedated with pharmaceuticals, overfed on junk food, and fatigued from a sedentary lifestyle
And rightly so. China is still not a transparent nation and its internal finances are largely understood to be a mess. Furthermore, accounting practices are shady at best and financial reporting could easily be embellished in China's favor, to mislead and instill further international investor confidence. We saw some book-cooking very clearly with Luckin Coffee which was caught on a fluke. Its almost certainly happening at every other Chinese company to some extent as well. The depth of the deception is impossible to know given the secrecy and unwillingness to submit to international standards for accounting transparency.

Alibaba would be undervalued by Western metrics were it a Western company. Its not, and thats what confuses most US investors. As such, the pricing accounts for the risk and is not only appropriate, but perhaps even optimistic depending on where you get your China news.

As soon as I get certified for life- I’m back to degeneracy in medical sales bc there is so much money in that.  Especially if I can be a tech as well. 

The outpouring of positivity since writing this has been nothing short of fucking amazing. Honestly tho, it’s exactly what I expected from all of you psychos. Huge respect to everyone here making it for themselves and merry Christmas idiots. We will talk about this place years from now as if it was something out of a book.

Thank you for the confirmation!

I love AI. It is called alibaba intelligence
Bought my very first call ever on MT. 25/march calls, kind of wishing I made it April or May
Bet it's mostly stocks, this is the way
Can’t imagine anything more terrifying
Help me. I'm so retarded and I have no fucking idea how to use this code.

I also can't stop drooling.
Sound advice and principles. Well done OP; upvote this man. Happy holidays and may luck be ever in your favor.
What is it with bitches now and pegging...all of a sudden this is like something they all want to do
This is where I'm at with it as well - why won't every cloud just make this as a service available to every one of their cloud customers?

Especially given their niche as dealing with non-tech businesses, which almost exclusively choose to start in the cloud these days (legacy are slow to migrate, but also slow to adopt any new tech so not exactly a win for PLTR either).

Don't get me wrong, I've made money on them like most of us, but also realize they are running a long race against some very big players who will likely take notice really soon.  AMZN can stand up competition in very short order, and capture the entire AWS base.  Same for others.

We'll see how big pltr gets before that happens - could be an acquisition on a significant sustained dip - maybe after first big cloud builds their own, second big cloud will buy these guys?
[deleted]
Yeah, this is where I bought 235 12/31 call for $260, and sold it at close for $210.

Also, I seem to forgot to add “/s” to my comment, and you retards think that I’m actually serious. Oh man...
Down 11% today thanks to BABA

Whew... rough day man!!!
some of us got hit harder today than others I suppose :(
Positions? Everything was virtually down lol
You be riding the rails?
Went all in BABA calls expiring March, probably a bad call idk we will see next week 😪
They’re being investigated for anti-trust violations in China
Ali byebye
Same
Customers don’t lose because they’re obviously willing to pay in exchange for not having to leave and pick it up themselves. That’s like saying someone “loses money” by buying a TV they want.

Restaurants also clearly think it’s worth it or they wouldn’t do it. 

Uber and the drivers basically do get fucked though. Only winners are at the top of UBER.
Fuck you . Lol congratulations
you need to be banned for this legit faggotry
Not AAL lol there are better options out there
Why can't Jack Ma just "disappear" and be replaced by someone more competent yet😭😭😭😭
Chin up buttercup
If they were OTM they will expire worthless

A perfect storm of shit
Goodnight, sweet prince.
I want face rippers!
But if you had bought a single share your investment would be worth almost $400K! Only one hundred years!!!
My magic 8 ball just told me to “expect a magnificent gap up on GME over the weekend” verbatim
I dropped 1 k on it for fun March expiry debit spread
It’s almost guaranteed to return. Will you have the patience for it tho? I dumped some airline shares for MT calls cuz it may return tendies sooner 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Most people haven’t but I assume it’s beautiful
I read every word on a post for the first time on wsb. I also work in steel production. I was going to keep quiet about this until feb but the cats out and now those who refuse to believe this will make people rich are delusional
Hold like Braveheart and the Scots and then skewer them for tendies.
Jack Ma got caught with a transsexual prostitute in Thailand
All that money you made and your still here on Reddit belittling others achievements and arguing with me. You sad as fuck 🤡🤡🤡
Thanks baws. I bought some April 30c the day after your first post and they're sitting at a pretty +80%. In for the long haul
dipped as low as 362 but rallied to near green EoD. UK COVID shit. 

Buying the dip was free money after the first hour and a half
I'm following the guy who clearly knows what he's talking about with regards to steel, and after doing my own research.

I bought when he posted the original DD. I'm up 30%.
And it says he has no positions so he would have had to sell his options and there was likely no buyer.
>No, not at all.
See his post from yesterday

Can’t catch every train 🤷🏽‍♂️ this MGNI track will take mad fast enough

Just being pinned by MMs at below $28 for options expiration.  When options activity is cleared the SP will move higher with ER in February. Own shares.
[removed]
If you give it the same P/S valuation that BBnB has it gives GME a 28 value. That's 20% on the upside.
[deleted]
My calls are ready for blast off 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀   Naught last week when it dipped. I like January so I have Jan 29th 2021 and 2022 calls
28 percent on spaccccccs
They started about the same amount lol
I guarantee everyone that this model is fit and evaluated on the training data and what you are seeing is an algorithm that doesn’t generalize to one second from now.
I feel like a significant portion of GOOG ads are bullshit. If you search say “Target <product>” often the first result will be an ad for Target- but you were already planning on being a customer! Clicking that makes it seem like their ad worked. A lot of people will just click the first thing rather than scrolling down to the unpaid search result they asked for. Obviously sometimes a competitor shows up as the ad, which would be the intended goal. Wonder if companies will catch on that a lot of their ad spend is bs
Made 1900 today and for me thats pretty neato. Merry Xmas autists
the problem with options is volume if nobody buys your options your fucked regardless if they’re deep ITM or ATM or OTM. 

It’s just shuffling the money around. Same with shares but at least they don’t expire
I heard there’s a country that blocked people’s pandemic relief money on Christmas Eve. I feel so sorry for their people, must be some poor shitty third world country.
Would be pretty messed up if BABA 200 becomes the new 300. How many people thought it was a steal when it initially dropped into the 280s in early Nov?
Nice confirmation bias
Genuinely kind advice thank u haha
If I were you. I'll tell your uncle I lost it it all. But in reality, every profit I make. I'll keep 100 percent of it. Lmao
Opinions on MVIS? I doubled up today on the dip, smart or stupid play. I got greedy and didn’t sell 2 days and missed out on some nice tendies.
I sure hope so lol. Next week could be yuge
NKLA puts are better than sex
Yes in fact I’d say ToS is the primary way to trade with TD
The fuck happened with BABA lately? Haven’t been paying attention cause I don’t have any.
im not half the man I used to be
Matched with a girl on Tinder who said she wanted to peg then I said something wild and she unmatched. Fucking blew it 🥺
Now this is investing!
Actually frightening.
Fukk forgot to close my dec 24 options which I sold. They were iTM.

Beginning of last week.
It will have to be federally legal for any kind of juicy gains. When’s that happening? Mexico was suppose to do it this month but it was pushed to April of next year.
Over any 20 year period, yeah. I mostly leverage the indices and sell covered calls on REITs.
2k in kanuckistan money is like 1500 usd. Also our government is trying to take it back from a lot of people apparently because they rolled it out on a "pay first, ask questions later" system for god only knows what reason lol.
If the goal was to lose money...I’d be a very successful trader
If OP put all $100,000 into spy, monthly dividend equivalent would be about $113 a month. 

If you’re looking for dividend there are better choices than SPY.

Edit: if OP DRIPs his monthly dividend in AGNC, he would gain 28 shares a month. Which would be an additional $51 in dividends
Uber actually makes money for basically doing nothing. Drivers earn pennies. Everyone else is sucking a big red dildo
Hey if past performance is any indication, you know how to time a dip right. You’ve got more balls than I do going in today lol but I’m looking to get back into BABA as well in the new year. Good luck to you too!

Wtf is a petition gonna do
# **BUT THE ARMY NEEDS MORE TANKS**
They are all broke
Anyone bitching about this is a true retard. If you legitimately followed sir jack you would be up about 20% just like him.. his initial DD was right around the $14 mark. Then you either take the profits today or bet on another run in the coming weeks/months and hold. If you knew anything about SPACs you can play this scenario 2 ways.. 1. Ride the initial rumor / LOI wave or 2. Ride the merger wave. Bonus points if you just bet right on a near NAV and rumors flow quickly so aren’t stuck holding your dick for months waiting for it to pop. 

There’s probably another ‘wave’ coming, so you idiots who bought it after a 20% run up can hold tight and hope it runs again when the merge takes place, maybe near the $25-30 mark depending on how the market responds and Barkbox fundamentals. Plus you get a sweet Becky ticker in your portfolio (BARK). I’m jealous, it’s cute. 

Otherwise don’t fucking complain, SPAC above NAV but before merger is all hype/rumor/scrambling for position. Did this guy both guess right, influence the hype plus the CEO was on CNBC last night? Looks more like lucky timing and he might have decided to lock in the gains, or not, idk if he confirmed it he sold or not. 

TLDR; don’t 100% follow someone blindly, fomo, then complain. It’s not over, some people took profit on this run. It’s probably fine either way, or it won’t be and you’ll be holding barkbox bags.
lol if 1.6mm autists used this it would crash world markets rofl
Elon, shut up and take my money you Modern day Midas you.
Yikes. Man didn’t realize how precious his time is
Lost 17% net value, mostly on a large BABA call collection, and I had to make tough decisions on what to sell in my portfolio to be able to double down on BABA. Twas no fun

who cares about 1 company? they can let this drop to $180, strip their market share and spread it across 100 companies, that would be better for brand value
That’s only if you’re an expendable drone. Suit and tie requirements are a way for employers to exact dominance and suppress individuality. The tie is your dog collar symbolizing you have an owner.
You didn't meet the minimum "YOLO" requirements
This
 is the way.  A simple process requiring only patience will beat most of the YOLOs on here or anywhere else.
Why are you mixed about weed due to covid? Because of retailers not doing well?
Same
If the stimulus passes, Apple is gonna moon. I swear I see Tik toks all the fricken time about how “why would you buy the Apple headphones, instead you could buy 4 Apple stocks”. I swear if the 2k stimulus goes through half of the white girls in America ages 18-30 will buy at least one stock of Apple
That’s just what I do. I’m also an idiot so please don’t actually follow me or listen to me. Personally, long calls that are ITM for companies that are well established have worked better for me than weeklies on anything. I’ve made the most gains on PayPal, Walmart, Tesla. I don’t fuck with shit like NIO or GME, but that’s just me.

Also, gains are gains. Every day I try to resist the voice in my head that says “I’m up 50%... but I should just keep holding longer....” because that always fucked me over too. Ya 50% isn’t the same as 200%, but it’s better than negative -%30 lol
WTF?

UBER eats is a funny transaction where all four involved parties lose money at the same time.

-Uber loses money, no surprises there. 

-Drivers lose money after accounting for gas, mileage and everything. 

-Restaurants lose money because of huge fees and cuts.

-Customers lose money because of fees and tips.
Omg i havent seen that in a while. Still funny.
You have both COVID and BABA? Damn, you need like exorcism
Use WeBull instead of Robinhood. I snagged some shares in pre-market at $16.5
This is top it’s over. Ima pick up PLTR for 3,50$ next year
Who would have thought CIIC would be the most consistently green stock in my portfolio.
Why would the people who bought today be morons? Do you know how many people were holding it at close last night? The people who bought today got a better bargain then most.
I'm gonna wait until I"ve made 100k from trading before getting any wsb swag. only 90k to go
Thanks for jolting my memory of the other outtakes, been a while.
There's a conflict between what MS wants in their deal (physical stores) and what he & this new activist firm wants.  I don't get his plan to try and turn gme into a version of steam, but ya maybe it'll work.  Should be volitile stock either way!  Good one to play the ups & downs.  I got 1/15 19.5p, fingers-crossed it dips.  If it hangs out flat a bit might grab a call - if they can oust the CEO or take over a few board spots that should be good for another pump.
I mean it's technically takeout with a middle man. I just paid $100 and the uber fees totaled like $8. So it's still $92 for takeout.
The only functioning one is steam though, every other app is trash ass cancer for your computer (epic games store, origin, etc). 

If someone wants to come be another steam platform, please by all means, try to compete with the gabe.
Exactly, yet identity politics and idolization are at all time highs...turns out it's quite easy to keep the plebs down.

The Second Account is after I YOLOed btw. Both accounts started the same at the beginning of the year
hmm i played stocks only. bought around 80.
i'd argue that the pandemic has been *better* for small business that non-pandemic.

all these people who had never heard of small businesses who are now bitching about the government not helping them were never going to shop anywhere besides walmart and amazon anyways, so their customer base hasn't declined, so any stimulus help they get is pure profit. it's unfair really they deserve *less* help

Magna won’t make that much money, relatively speaking, on autonomous EVs for Apple. The beauty of autonomous vehicles is that one car can service the needs of many people instead of just one. If we ever have truly autonomous vehicles, the total number of vehicles that need to be produced will drop significantly as private car ownership drops. The real money makers will be Apple and whoever makes their LIDAR. My money is on VLDR but I have no positions because I’m still butthurt about my 12/18 options that expired literally one day before the pump.
after hours and with a bunch of people buying 1-5 shares, it likely won't move much. Action begins again Monday morning.

Check his post history. Dear god....
Shhhhhhhhh
ARKG is weighted like Chad in biotech companies, not virgin loss-exposure like SPY
Diamond hands til Cohen calls a shareholder meeting in March
Unless you invested in one of those 99% companies which died in 100 years, and we don’t even remember they ever existed, genius.
This sounds good. 

I have 2 broker accounts. One for investing. Which is doing fine. I recovered a lot after Wirecard (had tons of it) but basically this account is my buy and hold account. Shares only. 

The second account is my daytrading or yolo account. And there im like 2k up and 4k down, which results in -8k. 

I gotta recover it. No pressure, this are not my life savings or so, nothing that will change emy life if i lose it, but damn it sucks. 

Especially that 2k win, 4k loss pattern. 

One advise I got, I think im gonna follow is - buy indicies CFD x20 on red days and sell on green. 2021 may not be so different from 2020. 

It still sucks. Need to clear my head over Xmas, not think too much and fucking go into 2021 to recover bro!

Lol 2k a month would be cheaper then infinite corporate welfare

Yes. Calls up 30%. Shares up 6%. I liked what they were buying in that fund
This is the same person in March that said don’t buy market crashing.
I'm suprised the 🌈🐻 aren't in full force in this discussion thread rn. They must be off setting the table for their wife and her boyfriend's romantic dinner tonight.
imagine american brand capitalism under yang's UBI

it would be like that meme of the futuristic city
Well today was awful.
when articles come out urging you to sell after going sideways for a month. were going fucking higher.
not lower. higher.
As smart as this is, fuck it. We yolo all winnings of PLTR calls.
BABA at 220... 

Holy fuck
See you Monday bb
This DD is retarded.

1. They're not close to FDA approval, nothing past early phase 2.
2.They didn't go public at cad 4.40, that was their 3rd capital raise in like a month (massive dilution cuz they know the stock is overvalued)
3. Had nothing to do with MMED per their own CEO.
4. He's in for like 0.01 cent per share or something retarded like that. This is literally free money for him. 
5. MMED main focus isn't Psilocybin, it's some other compound that's I'm too retarted to remember the name of cuz clearly my DD sucks even more than yours

can you trade on thinkorswim with a TD account I fucking hate the TD interface
TY, post saved.

I have all my IRA and 401k shit in Fidelity, maybe I’ll just go there
Why isn't BABA moving anymore?
Been holding calls for too long, every spike is a sell bc theta has been eating my ass
That'd be good for my port. I'm just saying to hedge for large January flash crash + volatility.

Do a remind me of this comment for Feb 1 or so.
[removed]
Of course I exit at the very fucking bottom, wipe out half my gains this year.
Only down $5K for the day 

Today was a good day
Might be a dumb question but, why is everyone talking about buying calls instead of directly buying shares?
CRSP was down too it was just low volume
[deleted]
If you read his DD, you wouldn't have bought calls that expire before earnings.
ARKF is cheap. Its a slower to grow but you can look for 2 percent in 2  months and its guaranteed.
Agreed, and thank you.  That's how I lost a fucking *ton* over this past year.  Total stupidity.  The next dumb shit I moved into was selling half at 100% and waiting for it to go ballistic, when I should have just taken my 100%'ers and been happy.  Most of what I lost this year were those two things.  I was profitable in *so many* positions and either broke even or lost it all.  Total fucking stupidity.  Well, maybe some of it was being naive.  Nah.. stupid.
or you could have just short sold GME with all that money yesterday and got an near 10% return instead of 1% playing with a ludicrously hot, overvalued stock. Could have even sold short covered puts with the current IV level and IV crushed some retard super bear
You are correct
I Was rejected by McD unfortunately
Good for that guy
The goalposts were never moved this sub just can't read, just like the original DD where half the damn sub thought it was an earnings play. It's *after* 13 days not *on* the 13th day, which means Monday, as today was day 13, and they either cover or pay  fines which they might take and keep shorting harder, with their dumbass behavior lately. Also, it's only a portion of the shorts that have to pay up, maybe not even enough to trigger the MOASS yet, but enough to go up significantly.
Any other good news you got?
Calls and a red portfolio
This was free money.  There was no way, absolutely no way, this could go tits up...until it went tits up. Now we either cut bait or sit and wait.  Sucky predicament.
Good point. They never asked me this in the interview.  Fake it till you make it I guess.

Bought @13.02 10 days ago. Thought I would provide DD from the gambling angle which I know inside out

This is exactly the real risk here. However unlikely, Alibaba as we know it could cease to exist as some other entity is cooked up by the ruling communist party. It would keep Jack Ma in check despite his wealth, set precedent and quiet other pesky Chinese billionaires who try/tried to interfere while allowing greater CCP control over commerce. They have no fear of the US ADR collapsing as they seemingly prefer moving to local listings on the HK & Shanghai exchanges anyhow. Again,  more control and less exposure to Western interference is a priority over a raging economy.

The only mitigating factor is that that China's growth still seems tied to Western consumption/trade and they are too smart to nationalize to the extent that they begin to economically regress. If they manage to ruin Alibaba, they will shake Western confidence in perhaps an unrepairable way, at least for a very long while. Also, economic regression will very likely lead to violent internal protest and discord by an emerging, young middle class that simply won't accept it. China is not as stable nor unified as many believe and they do not want to risk social fragmentation.

Anyhow, long story short, all Chinese ADR's carry much more risk than Western companies and thus they aren't underpriced, but priced accordingly. Its a bet on China's move toward open markets, capitalism and democracy versus more suppression and nationalism. If you believe the former will ring true over the next decade or 2, then the ADR's are cheap. If you believe in the latter, you could wake up with worthless stocks. (Im about 30% of 401k in Chinese ADR's).

All the research I've done has not yielded anything other than speculation from most analysts. I would love it if a pro-trader executive specializing on China would share some insights.

For shares, they definitely make a difference in some situations. I'm down thousands of dollars on a trade because TOS opened 5 mins too late when price was at my breakeven point which I had a sell order at. In that 5 mins, price went back below my sell order and once PM hours started for TOS, price kept dropping. I was asleep the entire time. Woke up and saw price hit my sell but I still had my position, ugh.

But mostly, I use it to buy penny stocks since many of them run right when PM officially opens.
Have fun staying poor
Too far out. Feb - June, like he said a ton of times.

ARKG struggled to make a comeback today, despite the end of day rally for SPY. 

SPY is due for at least a modest correction. It hasn’t even had a -1% day since **October**. If we see SPY correct slightly back to $355, ARKG could deflate substantially back to $88.

I wouldn’t be surprised to see ARKG below $90 before 1/15.
Yea man buy high 🚀🚀
Didn't tell you not to just to be careful. Sorry man

I personally got in on options when RMG was $11, but that’s because I used to sell instrumentation to Romeo Power around 3 years ago and thus followed the leadership on LinkedIn. Which is where I saw the announcement of the planned merger via SPAC.

Who told you to buy 1/15/21? He said in the original DD:

Feb (after earnings) - June calls.
Finally see some RMG posts in here.. never understood how it was never on anyone’s radars. It’s an incredible battery play, and one of the few SPACs that had options. 

I went in deep with May calls when price was at $11. Currently up around $200k and planning on holding through merger and Q1. 

They have signed $234M contract with Lion Electric and says they have $2B+ in advanced negotiations, and will come to light in Q1. Very likely the majority of that money will be via the USPS contract, with work horse, and Romeo will provide the batteries.
Woot!

I’m not arguing w you because this comment was written by someone who clearly hasn’t read any of the DD. 

They might be wrong, but there have been many many posts explaining why GME has potential. They don’t usually say “GME iS BeTtEr ThAN WaLmaRt GuYs!!” 

Agree or disagree but at least read the DD.
I will stop the world and melt with you
i think they can and do significantly affect the economy, but the upward inertia of the stock market is too strong and in the long run will be pulled or pushed up by any number of factors.

that's why i find it pretty dumb when people talk about presidents having "pro-market policy"
Who need details and graphs right?
hopefully all my 1/15 calls print....
RMG doing work
I'd argue that there are a couple of times when going short/ having puts is okay. You just can't hold them blindly and need to have an exit planned before.

1. short index funds as a hedge for a whole market correction against your stocks/calls.
2. short individual stocks that are overbought, overextended, and technicals signal a sell. You need to have a sell price target in advance though. Don't just hold because when they rebound off the support, they usually bounce hard and fast.
3. buy puts against your stocks as a guaranteed sell price.
not obvious, china only opened an investigation, what if they take action?

Why deep in the money? I went deep OTM...
Curious to know if ARK bought more BABA today to average down on the shares they bought on Monday.
360s 1231
Sure. I mean you’ve got to live somewhere right?

At the same time, tying up any extra capital in an investment when mortgage rates are so low is hard. You don’t want to be locked into a rate or return of 2.5-3.2%.

You want to be able to deploy as much of your capital into investments with the highest rate of return. 

For example if you buy a $500,000 house and have to put down 20% the. You’re locking up 100,000 that could provide a much better return. 

Whereas if your rent was 2,000 to 3,000 per month all in then you’re looking a minimum of 36 to 48 months of living expenses over 4 years before you “lose” 100,000.

Hell you could travel the world for a lot less than rent in any major US metro area.

I tried doing a search here and I can’t find any talk of it. I’ve taken a break here for a bit just getting back. Got that Christmas bonus to blow!
Her are my rules... and they’re gone.

Probably do some good DD and play it moderately risky.
MGNI.. i have no idea what it does. I picked up 25 30c two weeks ago.. luls. How high is this going? Should i realize profits
It's -2%?
Can’t wait for the “my robinhood account was hacked!”
I already owned a couple $25s for that date so I was just able to cut down the downside.

I paper handed some stocks a few days ago🤷🏻‍♂️
When you realize he can't get the ticker x because us steel already has it.
It was for whoever sold you those calls.
I have 3 brokers, RH, Webull, and TOS. 

RH for small options play where I don't want to pay $1 for each contract. Webull for super early premarket trades (it opens at 4am EST) and also has free options but I hate their UI, and TOS as my main account since it's the most advanced. If TOS had free options and earlier premarket hours, I'd shut down my RH and Webull account.
I picked up RH on a whim because I wanted to trade options and I know they approve anyone. Next year I might check out TOS or WeBull
google is a hell of a tool

Hey guys. Shorting NKLA felt like easy money. Where else can we find easy money like that? Or maybe that's selection bias. Just follow Hindenberg etc? Looks for bullshit-sounding IPOs and toxic management?

Dismissing TA as nothing more than "squiggly lines" is pretty boomer. Yes, learn about companies to make your picks, but you still need good entry points. It's the combination of fundamentals and technicals that makes a good trader bruh

I totally understand your skepticism. But I’m clueless. It’s not like my account is in the red or anything. I’m not too worried though I’ll just make damn sure everything is transferred out on Monday, they still have like 25k of my assets
Presidents don't actually affect economy as much as they make it sound like they do
I trade shares which is also worthy of a ban. It has more upside potential than it has downside that is my rationale
Stop telling us about the bun, Frank
Obviously
I haven't been able to find much of a bear case, and I'm a contrarian. I spent 4 hours researching steel after his original DD.
Oh ya
As a board member,  you should suggest them to start making ev, or solar panels. Put it up for vote
$20, irrational as it gets. why anyone would bankroll this zombie company is beyond me
So you’re saying, nice entry point for BABA if we aren’t in.

That’s a nice aunt’s analysis. 

It has more to do w lack of debt, cash on hand, and a badass billionaire taking an interest. They also still sell make sales (somehow). 

No one is putting their money in GME because they think gme as is is the next big thing.
So $700 ? 😂
How about $600? It’s all we can do.

First of all, Why the fuck did you trade on Ally. 2nd, own their stock but have zero money in their accounts. 3rd, they might be doing you a favor for prohibiting you sell on a red day. “Hmmm this retard wants to sell BABA at this price let’s not let him do it and he will thank us later.”

Technology wise , it's not even close to being the same thing as DBS. DBS involves putting in large and long rods , genrally 2 or 3 deep into the brain. Neuralink involves around 1000 micro thin ( less thin than hair ) flexible threads. And they can't reach that deep for dbs yet ( that will happen in further iterations when they replace the visual camera in the robot to something like a red light scanner that can see that deep ). What you want to compare it to is other BCI tech , which is a different conversation ( I think they are far ahead , but thats  somewhat subjective as most are using different approaches and a objective comparison is not possible ; I could write pages on this ).

Also , on-chip spike detection is something they are working on which very few others are. Most researchers do spike sorting in large external computers. As an analogy , think consumer GPU ( which uses shortcuts to work ) vs impressive but power and time consuming ray trace based rendering done in a data center.

Utility wise , paralization is only their first target as , bluntly put , those patients are fucked up enough that it is ethical to test it out on them. You wouldn't put something like this in someone who has , for example , lost a leg as they can still live a life even without it. The downsides of  this new tech override the positives. Not so much for someone who literally can't do anything , even effectively communicate.

There are many potential uses and market. Neuro-prosthetics would be one , as an example.

From what I understand (which isn’t much) APHA is absorbing TLRY but keeping the ticker. 

I also heard something about a lawsuit but I haven’t kept up on it as my minimal focus went from weed stocks to GME lol
Nope. Thats the rest of the market when they all think of selling at the same time

Dont feel bad man, you're not alone

Once I went back to shares i immediately started coming back outta the hole I dug for myself. Definitely tried option too soon before understanding them
It is absolutely going to $0 over the long run this pump is literally nothing but a WSB orchestrated short squeeze. If you’re going to fomo in at the top at least set a tight stop loss. Good luck.
If they have massive revenue behind them, then they are legitimate. The dotcom crash was basically any company placing dotcom in there title got a retarded valuation even if people had no idea wtf they did if anything at all...

> Hey OP, big follower into the GME story. 700 shares(cb 14.50) and a few calls here and there. Love the write ups you've posted these few days. Wanted to give you some food for thought on your write-up tomorrow. We are most likely getting our bi-monthly report on short data (hopefully). With all this frantic buying WSB and RC(combined easily 20%+) has done, along with, im sure, other retail investors that see gme mooning and want to get in. The float is DRASTICALLY going down. When 

Thank you so much for your kind words. Means a lot to me and I greatly appreciate it. These are my very first Reddit posts ever. 

I do agree with a lot of what you are saying. Others were concerned that because WSB is paper handed and a lot of us will take profits at 2x or something that it won't go parabolic. One of the things I was going to mention was what you mentioned, the FOMO factor. 

At the same time though, the shorts are big players. Without a MAJOR catalyst like Cohen revealing he has enough options to buy 50% of the company or something like that, I think will more likely squeeze like TSLA did. (Over a few months, as they slowly start convincing investors that they are there to stay)

Through all the memes/informative articles/shills, I do believe people are starting to be better informed and tougher handed.

I was super tired last night, and I was trying to put the DD up before it is too late. I think I did a really bad job at drawing the picture in regards to used consumer electronics model. I might touch up on this first because the people need to believe in the business before they can really believe in the squeeze.

Mannnn, in re: #12 I remember when I thought I was a genius for selling TSLA at $800 earlier this year and quadruple my Boeing stack at sub $100.

Turns out the "crazily overvalued" TSLA had a nice 4x from that point, and Boeing had a 2x.

Even when I was ignoring #12 in the best of cases, I was wrong.
lol... people will still be saying this to me in 10 years, just because of my username.

I don't study with the same intensity anymore, I found that I can make $ just by (generally) following meme pumps, buying contracts 45-65 days out on solid stocks that have been consolidating for a while, and an occasional yolo.  It took a fucking long time, *countless* books / vids / lectures and a lot of money to figure that shit out.  Simplify and follow the trend.  2021 will be the year.

Edit: RemindMe! 2 weeks so I can tell this guy he was correct.
Everyone holding baba trust me you are not fucked at all. Long term this stock is going full on Amazon status. This dip is a blessing and a curse. I don’t hold baba cuz I knew this was coming but she’ll bounce nice when it happens.
So BABA lost what? 100 billion today? Yikes.
Idk but I need this because I basically bought the top. Average price of 14 per share. Sigh.
so glad most of you made a million dollars this year, thank you so much for the constant daily reminders!!! absolutely nothing changed about my life this year, despite spending every waking minute here.

Maybe BABA. It was at 300 a couple months ago, down to 220 now due to regulatory problems. My guess is it will double in the next couple years from 220. Leaps are a decent play here.
That chart goes back to 2018. When did SPAC merge with XL?
Should have had some TSLA calls

That’s how bureaucracy works. You put in 900B and end up giving $600 to consumers... when 600x300M is only 180b. So we could have sent out checks 5... 6 times as big? This happens with literally everything the government does. Including the other 5 trillion they gave out. At this point the government could have loaded every Americans brokerage account with enough to not be PDTed.

according to zero research and just based on a few tweets i've seen that may or may not be true, historically S&P growth is greatest under a dem president and split congress, but also the difference is just a few percentage points no matter which way it's sliced and the only logical conclusion one can reach is stonks only go up

Nah there’s going to be hype leading up to GA runoffs on the fifth if there’s even a hint of Dems sweeping.

I’d expect McConnell to fold before then and let a bigger stimulus through because if Dems do sweep it’ll be even bigger. Not that there won’t be more in the future anyway, but if Mitch the Bitch wants any participation trophies he’ll get a big deal done before then.

And hoooooold. 

Fuck me. First thing on monday I'll do is probably YOLO in some stupid shit and paper hand once it drops a little. 

I still got 13k from my 21k trading account in. Any ideas for a 2021 comeback? Gotta make at least 8k...
Get assigned and ride it out, sell calls against them on green days.
Imagine thinking China is more powerful than the USA 😂 they are some dumb fuckers. See $LK and $BABA
“I don’t want a raise, because I’ll have to pay more taxes!”
just put a post it note on your cam when u are naked.
I'm sorry about your loss
Ace man, now withdraw and get started again
How do you factor in trade costs and capital gain taxes?
Sure. Nothing to do with global COVID shutdowns.

Yeh, I took it as 'not enabled' on his acct.
Kudos to [u/patrioticparrots](https://www.reddit.com/user/patrioticparrots/) for not deleting this post.
That volume, though.  If you sell them at market order - you will tank it back to April's level, lmao
Anyone who thought that was going to happen is hilariously uninformed. 

Biden is the guy responsible for making it so that student loans are not part of bankruptcy protection...lenders paid Biden off through his son who was sitting on a legal board that he had no business being a part of. There was controversy about the payment at the time...long history of going through Hunter to pay off daddy.  

RIP to everyone gambling with student loan payments, git gud at politics suckers 😆
You are too nice.
I dont know. That dude’s head is not proportioned right. Big head, big forehead, small hair on top
dude I'd let him pee on me for a share and will come back every day for more
I think we get it, you are overexposed to pltr, you are scared and you have realized you have made a bad decision, it’s still a pump and dump. No amount of shilling will change that. You will lose a fuck load of money.

Edit: I REPEAT, NO AMOUNT OF SHILLING WILL CHANGE REALITY, YOU ARE GOING TO GET FUCKED AND THEN I WILL LAUGH EVEN HARDER THEN I AM LAUGHING RIGHT NOW

Edit 2: THE MORE YOU SHILL THE WORSE YOU MAKE IT FOR YOURSELF, SO KEEP GOING, KEEP REPLYING TO JUSTIFY YOUR POOR DECISION MAKING, KEEP DOWNVOTING TO MAKE EVERYONE BELIEVE I AM LYING TO YOU, KEEP DIGGING YOUR OWN HOLE DEEPER AND DEEPER
You gotta be stupid to see how the CCP fucked BABA and still think its a good time to immediately buy a BABA call. Shits gonna trade sideways until its safer
Depends, is he dehydrated?
TSLA saves my ass every time
Boom boom loser
Because RH's AH is only 2 hours and premarket is only 30 mins while most other brokers is way longer for both.
bruh no one i mean no one goes around and fucks with the pooh gang

jacks probably gonna get slattered in honey and spitroasted
The loss not enough, not enough volume, theta, could be a bunch of things
Big brain time

Let’s have a little BABA bag holder cope thread in the daily. Roll call retards how much are you down today? Did you sell? How much more can you take before you give up? Give us the juicy details 💦
Bro wanna buy some Enron stock?

I get in BEFORE volume. I think it has some good room to run I think it’s gonna be good.
I am hungover and horny as FUCK
hhe loves china so tis a safe bet
To late 😅
Same for me with v u z i. I saw a training with someone using the glasses and bought in without any DD. Fukr went up 170% in 2 weeks.
Jack ma fucked the pangolin
So are my feb calls fukd
On thin gay volume that is. Penny stocks will fluctuate +-50% all the time. I’m not even slightly worried. I need to build a position before you homos FOMO the crap out of it
Down 3k off of it today from short puts at $225 lol

Bro I’m sure if it was up 2 or 3 percent he would’ve maybe played it differently. Yesterday I told myself I’d hold until 2022 but when I saw the numbers I sold immediately.
Small face, dirty penis.
I hope not. I need my 8k to clear so I can buy more. THEN it can go up.
says the guy who led everyone into the 2008-2010 recession buy telling everyone to buy at the top and then got called out on COMEDY CENTRAL by Jon Stewart and cried like bitch get fucked
Nice job calling the top idiot.
Probably but even Cramer said he wants to wait another day to see how it goes.
You know whats funny, my wife is actually on her period right now and I 100% got denied booty.  She came over to sweet talk me into letting her buy a new car, somehow she got a back massage, I got no sex, and she has a new car.

Yikes! CCP clapped those cheeks
Your prize is my gratitude cus I just bought 30c 12/31
Damn, you timed that buy option perfectly.  
Fuck your and merry Xmas with that money
Buy something from a different industry based in a different country. Perhaps even use a different asset class.
Wtf that doesn’t sound right
Only if you didn’t sell before and are not going to sell later, but today - just today
I am a drunk trust fund baby so no problem yoloing

They attempted the ez way but House Rep blocked it. Will do more formally on Monday
[removed]
Yeah i dont see a Ma Bell splitup scenario. Baba is too intertwined in their economy and quite frankly their most successful domestic company ever. Heck how many citizens and Committee members own Baba?  Its like owning Apple. Everyone owns Apple. National pride that drove them to try to build their own airliner means they aint gonna shoot the Nio, Baba goose. Tighten the collar aye until jack ma toes the Party line.
Good. Keep the status quo
Jimmy is our guy! I will fight these little stock twits nerds for him
Red, just like christmas
Honestly I feel like you could pick any China stock this year and win big bucks once Biden in office.
Lel kek
Perfect, I learn by doing
One of my best trades of all time was dumping my huge amount of BABA calls last Friday at a 20% loss wew that was gratifying then and it is very gratifying today. Never touching anything chinese again (except NIO you can still get this D 😘)
https://i.imgur.com/LWozrXv.jpg Look at today’s volume on BABA on the year chart
damn BABA got absolutely destroyed today, 13% in a day for a company with 600b market cap...
In for 15G! Let’s roll

Whenever price drops too quickly toward my buy price, I tend to reconsider. In your case, it straight skipped right past it.
Idk...I’ve sold TSLA spreads the day of and they pushed the order through. I would check to see what your level is...
Lost 1k today, hope nio fucking moons
God fucking damnit. Have to spend the next 4 days with family and not gambling

Thanks for the tip! Absolute steal!
I'm in on those as well, down 30% fml 🤣
You wrong , Cramer always says he doesn’t like Chinese stocks since reasons we all know . He specifically said that if you insist buying Chinese stock the only company to consider is Baba cause it have been managed as American company
Same here chum. I 4xed from this time last year
Blah blah, just buy the dip. Today was a clear sign of a panic selloff.
I knew Tesla was the move today. Decided to lose some on FUBU instead smh
I bought 1000 shares of l u m o back in April on a whim, should have gotten more fuck!
Monday Trading Plan: 

Rather than buying another stock on Monday, I am gonna go out and look for a used Hot Tub Time Machine from 2010 on post-Xmas sale. Then I will travel back in time and make some YOLO trades.

Sharks are just sexy fish
Weekly QS play. QS made me about 30k so I’m not mad about it. Snaps dip took me for 1k but I got til Jan 31 with them. Averaged down. Bought in more in today dip on a few others
Not apple leaps
Thanks, will look into it!
What are we supposed to do for 4 days
I see youre still learning options. Maybe if it dips a bunch monday you can sell for a slight profit
Probably the richest too
Why do you assume I use RH? I mean, I do but still. I also have a boomer account at Vanguard lol! I just needed to know if I'll be staring at my phone for AH action for 2 hours or more this afternoon haha.
No I mean OPs opinion
If BABA tanks on Monday, I'll pretend hackers got into my account and went on a BABA spread buying spree
END THIS ABOMINATION!!!!!

Then again I'm also mad most US brokers don't offer swaps of any kind.
I gave her a gift too
C’mon guys its about time we bring SLV gang back, are we all in hiding now? Bull case, silver in solar, Biden blows the budget on green infrastructure, retard silver hoarders, commodity super cyclone. Risk case, too retar, no downside visible.
Bro, you can fuck my wife whenever you want. I bought STIC yesterday because of your post and I'm already up 26%.

Hell no. The 600 check one barely passed. Now they're grovelling over 2k.
Zero chance, unfortunately
First I hear "the rich people will pay fines for not covering"

Now I hear "Its supposed to happen Monday not today"

I swear if someone moves the goalposts one more time I'm selling  even on boomer returns
I thought 250 was a good support. It was until yesterday.
Everything was red lol ya wife on her period. Still smashed her tho

As well as more ARKG

Only a true retard fails to see how closing excess stores actually improves their balance sheet and increases their profitability. Your put will expire worthless...
Ok buddy.... That's why the chinese have so many businesses..... Trust me he cares about money just as much as the rest of us🤡🤡🤡
Xi took his disgusting micropenis and fucked every BABA holder
Obviously. Real Chinese food is fucking disgusting food for pours.
Geez. Well high risk high reward. Just do me a solid and don't lose it on a stupid ticker. Do you plan on diversifying and actually investing some or just continuing to yolo? Whats the end goal?
>CRM, BABA

same, help
Sir this is a wendys
Did they not vote today? What tf is happening
Haha, you tried to warn me.
WTF are you reading? It keeps getting downgraded. I'm still in it for the long haul and buying on these dips, but I don't expect my major tendies for years down the road.

So Ally was blocking me from selling shares today, I called support and they told me that Ally has “made a business decision to close the account” lmao what is this shit I’m so confused. I’d been slowly moving my positions over to RH and just had some of my stinkers left in Ally (mainly BABA) so is this there way of telling me to fuck off already? I’ve never had any bad transactions or negative balances

Guy on the phone told me I should be able to liquidate everything any time I want but the app was literally stopping me from selling BABA today 

😡 Ally
Hahaha, okay, this one is really funny!

Got a few 1/15 ACB $7p 's and acb fell today by 5% and the put value remained the same and even dropped some. Could anyone explain for my retarded ass, I figured the put value would increase

i remember back when i was an emotional bitch and i put 9000$ on spy 0DTE to try and scalp and constantly revenge trade.

im glad ive grown. i dont think ive touched a spy 0dte since that day, (3-4 months ago) and I usually dont have that much control. Much better trader because of it, dont day trade boys. By swing trading you increase your chances of profit vs day trading by like 40%
Thought so. But I'd take 10k. Better than nothing
CNBC headlines saying $2K stimmy check not likely and then goes on to say Crazy Nancy will hold a vote on it Monday?

Yeah it's retarded, but fuck it.
Good for you. Now go home and get your fucking shinebox!
No because I have no friends
I assume you use RH. After hours goes until 8pm EST. Not sure if it closes earlier today or not.
Me for months: if BABA hits 250 I'm buying 200 shares. 
Me today: I better wait for 200.

American Chinese food is better than authentic Chinese food.

What’s your plays
Who else thought $TSLA was a dead boomer stock 😅
I thought it was too late to get into alpp but with the nasdaq listing in the near future it will only go up. Buying at open on Monday no matter what the price is
Well today was fucking brutal.  I am diversified, and on a green SPY day, all my shit was red all the way across the board.
I’m not touching the piece of shit until after New Years. Already played it once and almost got burned.
Getting momma a gift with these last minute gains ❤️
Looking to go bullish too, bought in at 225
Thanks.
Why are you right and the guy above you is wrong ?
Come on now. . .LMFAO!

Who the fuck is still selling after hour? Fuck off and go home already you pathetic POS!!
Bought the NVDA dip
I tried to daytrade it today, and lost $50. So yeah I feel ya
[deleted]
Would u let Tim Apple pee on your chest for leaps
calls on anything
IV tanks after earnings, people anticipating something increases the IV. Options prices are heavily based on IV. So you sell while the IV is still high, meaning you sell before the earnings.

If you hold options through earnings, you could be right about the direction, but lose money. If you’re wrong about the direction and the IV tanked, god help you.
Gaining money is not as impressive cause you have to pay more to the government 😩😩😩 /s

BABA WILL TANK TO $ 100

TOO BAD JACK MA DID NOT SUCK XI'S DILDO

Cool cool thanks
Small asian peewris got ya good eh?
Pretty sure this was an open casting call for a low budget movie. It also features the iconic backflipping nunchaku guy.
I think if their tech actually works good they'll  have some catalysts by then and/or new customers to make it go up.
same here, more than 50% gain just swinging/holding some GME shares in the last 35-40 days. If he makes 100% off of me, but I make 50% in the process, I'm cool with that deal.
Selling drugs to kids
I’m prolly gunna regret not buying the baba dip

You guys are fucking crazy!
Cheater

Woof. Good luck Clark
I really feel it’ll start it’s ascent towards 100 the closer we get to earnings on the 26th. That’s really the only catalyst I see saving my calls
If silver would stop being a bitch and hold 26 thatd be dope
Its a spac. Mergers are announced
6000 on GME it was my first time buying on a  Green Day, the following day the stock dropped 30%
Fat chicks need luvin too
off what
I think it will; today was a low-volume day and every move is magnified.  Even if it drops further it'll bounce back eventually -- can't see it going too low in the near future.
Remindme! 10 days
what the fucking fuck, corsair? 2 big down days in a row? No. not okay

Well account is at ATL, I am officially not having fun anymore. Luckily it's all long dated, gonna delete RH app and let it ride. MSOS, CRM, BABA, MT, DM
BABA leaps seems like such an obvious play that it’s bound to fail. That being said, in for 11/21 270c
Merry Christmas everyone of you degenerates
this is my strategy
Well they are releasing the first real (albeit watered down) AR glasses in 2021

Won’t be long before they are fully functional

They created their own arm cpu, might not be mind blowing but it is real science. 

I’m 1000% sure they are working on the “next iPhone”, if you expect them to make a world shattering release every year you are dumb as fuck. 

Lack of iPhone innovation is a pro for the company.  Milking revenue while they come up with the next thing. 

Apples real problem is they are the definition of a monopoly and are using it to crush competes (worse than any other company)
bruh PJ traders fuckin love selling off. They're the quickest to smash sell on any spookiness

However it took them 6 months to come up with a bill that ended up funding some strange shit.

Even I’m scratching my head on some of it.
No. 2 on Boomer Investing 101 = diversify. They will never buy $3 million worth of BABA so the joke is on you

Why tf is he always so cock hard for the Blazers? Been a fan my whole life, they always suck except that 2001 year when they got hosed by the refs in Game 7 vs the Lakers
You're right, I *am* insane, but that doesn't make my guess *wrong*.  What caused it to drop?  News.  What will cause it to go up?  News / sentiment *countering* what cause it to drop.  How likely is that?  50 / 50.  I'm leaning toward people seeing that massive fucking drop when they look at their portfolios, panicking because the market is closed, and selling more on Monday.  However, if "good" news comes out, maybe they buy the dip.  If it doesn't between now and Monday, I'm thinking we see more freak out.  Then we have to take into consideration Asia, Euro, people on holiday and not even looking at their portfolio, etc.    


...what happens if *more* bad news comes out?  It surely ain't gonna make the shit moon.  

What are the odds of funds pushing news to push it down further so they can buy more, cheaper?  Pretty fucking high, since that's the kind of shit they do.

Of course, I could be wrong.

If boomer invests 3 million he is up 30 k on your ass
Expiration was today

Besides, fidelity no longer allows to trade options on expiration day

Also, I tried to write a covered call, the system wouldn’t accept. It said I have no buying power. But when I sell a covered call, I sell against my holdings. I have done it many times. Not having buying power doesn’t apply in this situation 

I think, the boomer street is trying to stop WSB
I’m all in on MGNI leaps (and FLueNT, but I can’t talk about that here).  But I’d be looking at UVXY if I was expecting volatility.

Added another 300 shares on the dip. 500 shares total. This is hitting $30 by January 2021 🚀🚀🚀🚀.

Just wait for some catalysts regarding new deals and it'll reach the moon.

Reported. Shill post for a stupid website
This is just a flex. Ccp aren’t going to eff their own company. If anything they will protect it. Yes a bought the dip baby
So here is what I did this week: 

Bought:
BABA
CRSR
TDOC

Sold: 
PRPL
Opendoor

Merry christmas you filthy animals!
Congrats you have been scammed by a P&D
Fuck it, I made 20% profit on GME with daily swing trades, and now I'm 30% up with some solid 💎👐. If getting in early means holding the bags for the pumpers and collecting fat double digit gains in a matter of weeks, DAYS, I'm sold.
Is this curable? Asking for a friend but I also can’t feel my legs.
Sigh this why we needed that other mod so we can get rid of stupid post like these.
Happy holidays, you filthy degenerates.
stocks or options?
Just flip it and merry Xmas you filthy animal!
What’s the stock trading equivalent to Charles Barkley putting 100k on the trailblazers to win the west?
My account was at all-time highs yesterday, even WITH tens of thousands of unrealized losses in BABA... 


Today wiped out all Q4 gains. I'm back to fucking September.
Doordash is another recent example.

I mentioned Facebook in the sense that it has poisoned our discourse, makes people more connected yet more lonely, isolates people in echo chambers, helped elect a simpleton to president, etc. While I recognize how profitable data collection can be, personally it's not a company that I would highly 'value,' if that makes sense. IMO
same
You can still buy puts now.
What if it drops more next week?
Indexes green, what do you mean?
Probs did
Merry Christmas ya filthy animals
The bagholding will be epic when all this is over.
Don’t fight it, stay away

One of the things I miss about nyc
Why not just spy instead...? Unless there's a need for monthly income
Bought 20k worth of baba stock today. Merry Christmas guys buy the dip.
Mainly people thinking, wow, green by EOD.. buy.. then price slows down, oh, never mind, I don't want to pay that much anymore. Also the call holders thinking, maybe I should secure my profits and sell.. supply > demand, price drops.

Or I made that up and it's not how option pricing works at all. This is why I moved away from options for the most part.
Puts it is then
minor setback for a major comeback
Proof of the trades?

CRSR gonna need to partner with GME to exclusively sell their gaming gear at the newly created cyber cafes / TSLA showrooms
Nah like 350 lmao, not enough to truly be upset about but enough to say fuck!
Full speed ahead! 

I can see a moon over yonder, it’s dipped beyond the horizon.
Oh stfu. 99% of the people who are getting their panties in a knot have never even fucking heard of these people before trump pardoned them. Suddenly it’s a giant issue. Fuck off
Was definitely a stressful ride and admittedly I’m nervous about BABA. Good luck to you man!
Embrace it
let's get the bread! I have 09/21 $250
Biden basically said no to cancelling 50k in student loan debt. Despite the fact that it would only cost 1T and literally be a stimulus for middle and low income. This is why I have no doubt the market will continue mooning under status quo Joe. His administration will print and pump for the mega rich just like everyone else and maybe throw a few peanuts to the plebs
earlier her hair and makeup looked like she just got railed
NIO is gonna pump January whatchu talking bout

...??
Markets close early today. After hours move up as well.
It is only bullish under Trump presidency, it’s actually the worst case scenario under Biden.
It’s following snowflake I guess cause they have a huge position in it
Nope
Speak EST
Another lesson learned. Ive seen thinkorswim being recommended a bunch so will check that one out
They should have sourced it WSB instead of TSA
man, I bet a lot of people bought BABA weekly puts on Wednesday just based on the charts potentially setting up a drop.
Christmas rally is last 5 days of the year plus first 2 days of new year
So better than most of WSB?
Good things take time
Beating wsb by 103 percent. Not too bad

Cultivation has zero margins. Also Canadian product is see as inferior. Get into retail, cultivators don’t make sense and bleed, that’s where the mergers come in.

GRWG is good, curaleaf and sbvcf are more speculative.

Edit: If the oils/pharma market grow hardcore, and for non-retail usage, then I can see Canadian cultivators succeeding.
I'm not in balls-deep, but I have two options plays for 6/18/21. I did a little research into the price of steel and it is indeed going up. The only steel ETF I could find is also going up.

This probably won't be a 10-bagger, but it appears to be a fairly secure position to increase in the next year.
$MT and $VALE, also $ICLN (I can’t explain why, its just been so good to me). $AMD and $PLTR for the memes. $FAN and $ACES for the index memes.
Slight red day today, but huge week overall. 

Merry Christmas boys. Have a great weekend. See you Sunday night for Futes. 

And as always...keep holding GME.

Until the pissing contest between Jack Ma and Chairman Xi is done, this is a risky proposition. I will be waiting a little longer to see where this lands, and definitely will go a lot longer than February with any position to account for some time to manage the unknowns. Your position looks like an “all chips on red” at Vegas, right now. High reward, maybe, but too much risk for an old guy.

Lost 10k on BABA calls. Merry Christmas to you too Xi
I’m in SPACs but to have 150k to yolo on PLTR shares at (I assume) a young age, it seems like that’s not possible without having at least a giant startup pool

Hey y’all I fucked myself over cause I’m a retard, lost all my gains cause I am new to calls and made a oopsie, what do I get in on on Monday to make some of these ouchies go away
Ahhhh....yes. Yes.
100% has more impact than 200 or any random number. Go beyond 100% and then you imply the limitless nature of your potential gain.

Agree with all of this except Dave Lee is a fucking G, not some rando.

Check out his YouTube page, it’s a goldmine of info. Found LMND and NET early because of him.
Let’s be real here, I’m sure he has his own agenda, and he wants this thing to pop. Obviously the more reads this post gets, the more attention it garners, and the chance of this whole mooning thing coming to fruition becomes higher. However, whatever he posts isn’t false as the steel prices are going up. How big of an impact will it actually have on the stock? We will have to find out. 

Though, what are the chances of this thing actually taking off? Who knows, it might be 70 to 30 percent chance right now.

This is a pump and dumb and sadly, many people on this board are going to be stuck holding this stock with 25-30% loss in a week while this guy makes a healthy profit and moves on to another bullshit stock that no one should hold. Please BAN him.
Once upon a time when these positions were a little more mainstream they discussed how they would get rid of social security, basically we could cut a check to every person under the eligible age, for their money they paid into it back. The current old people would be grandfathered in. Moving forward, no more payments, no more deductions from your paycheck. It’s not perfect but we’re going to have to take an L at some point, or our social security will expire worthless like the 4/20 180 SPY Puts this sub was holding.
Why not just multiply the low price stocks by 10 or 100 and then get the answers?

If you bought shares rather than calls, just hang tight. You'll be fine and you will make a lot of money. Question is when. While the short squeeze is why many of us are here, this is also a really great value play especially with Cohen potentially becoming a big part of the company. That's why this play is so special ... even if we don't get our squeeze, we still have the value play to fall back on.
You need a radio station dedicated to WSB market news.

I want to believe you but everyone who has said the market will tank on a Monday was wrong. ATH incoming.
Thanks, OP. My take: this is dangerous. Jack Ma is def. locked up somewhere getting his balls beat with a cactus like the Daniel Craig scene, false charges will probably fly against BABA officials, and BABA is at risk of being cut up into little turds and sold off to state-owned banks.

So you bet your sweet tits I rode PDD up at open and BTFD in BABA! Mama raised a moron, not a fearful cuck.

(2022 spreads though. This IV increase was fucking nuts and BABA could drop some more...)

What does your algorithm say to do today regarding BABA? Buy the dip or wait to see an uptrend confirmation?
Oh no....you lost 70k in a day
71% is pretty good!
...and then what happened?!
If you can take thousands or even tens of thousands in losses and still live the same life, enjoy it. Good things don’t last forever.

If you can use this in real time couldn’t you just pull real time data. Have it spit out a “buy” moment. You execute the trade manually. Then have it spit out a “sell” moment and you execute the trade again? Would essentially work on any platform. You just need real-time data api.

for $600, I bought 155 x IWM 120p expiring 1/22/21. I think mango fucks shit up bigly the next 4 weeks. Y'all need some kind of hedges if you have any long positions.
When Jack Ma speaks you get the idea he's an inbred dipshit on a good day operating with all of 1.5 brain cells, literally sounded like a six-year-old onstage with Elon. CCP should have eaten BABA alive by now.
Its down 33% in 2 monts. More than half of these losses  were in 1 day (today). I would call it darkest. I think,  it's oversold,  and should bounce,  at least in short term
I bought all the dips this week basically, my cost basis is $3 right now because I forgot to sell some when it ripped up past $92 today

I am going to need to start selling some at the rip and re-buying at a lower cost if I can

AMD usually goes up, them comes right back down again. Has been doing this for months...

Yeah the problem here is social security and Medicare is a pyramid scheme at this point.

It isn’t the people paying that would need convinced, it’s the people receiving which generally makes up the majority of the voting populous.

They do not have the funds to float long enough to stop supporting those dependent on it now.
Usually pile their gold horde at tax havens like Ireland or south east asia then issue bonds to pay expenses back at home. America literally has to bend down and suck corporate dick with tax holidays for companies to bring back home cash.

Yesterday was -0.92 at close. Today it did closed higher which resulted in a net gain from the mega pump at the end. I got in after the huge AAPL rally day, so the movement after that really fked me. Foolish for me to think it will continue to rally like a meme lol

ICLN. TAN. have been great for me the last year. And I don’t see those going anywhere but up in my lifetime.
Ditto, but that’s more of a lotto i got in on Monday since there were rumors of a price target increase which just got published today. So hopefully that’ll provide a short term boost. I’ll take a two-bagger on it if there’s a chance.

I exaggerate a little but after Burry letter last year I put my full ira of near 20k in GME near $3.70. Then in March-April market collapse I put in 30k new money near under $4, but in April it dropped below $3 and I bought several thousand shares between $2.80-$3.30 on margin

You bulls are gonna get what you deserve 🐻

#FUCK BABA, FUCK XI POOH BEAR FAT FUCK, FUCK CHINA AND CCP
TL;DR

tl;dr
Diversify up to 100%. This can be achieved by putting all of your account into a single stock
I bought some 290c, 300c, 305c for BABA at close, I might be the king of retards 😃🔫
Options are fuckin nuts, I watched some baba 215 puts go from $40 to over $500 to worthless by end of day
I kinda liked the fireworks screen saver.
Have 4 days for CCP and BABA to start making out in front of the camera.
Totally.
Who knows. I have watched this guy for a month or so. Nice to see an opinion with some money behind it. I wish WSB made you verify you have 25k in your account before posting just like day trading.
LMAO
🤴
If Baba could just open at 235 on Monday that would be hella cool.
Source? It's definitely just around 175 fulfillment places worldwide but I do agree that I did not illustrate the 'gap' that GME will fill more clearly.
There is a reason they are called FDs
In the night you will be visited by the three ghosts of Tendies
If you didn’t buy the ARKG dip today you must hate tendies
Fuck I forgot to get my amzn calls in

Pleas don’t fly yet jeffie
I’m now beyond balls deep in GOEV, I’m nipple deep and soon to be gargling for air.
Oh yeah. He was 100% right, haha. Its just the market doesn't yield to corruption even when its that blatant.
RH as usual glitching and confused with the early market close. Guess its our Christmas present from our buddies at RH
Good luck, that's too risky for me.
Omg I thought the same until I read this comment. I was wondering why more ppl weren’t commenting it was fake, lol
12/31? Fuck it I’m in
My broker (fidelity) basically emails my financials in early January so I roughly know what I’m looking at tax wise, but I’m a freelancer and get like 25-40 w2’s/1099’s a year and I hire an accountant to do it all for me.

I wonder if he’ll be happy with my new found gambling addiction haha.
That dude has impeccable timing
We're exactly like that meme eith the orangutans.

I don’t see PLTR hitting 33 in 8 days but I sure hope it doesn’t nose dive
This guy belongs here
Nice. I got feb expiration so I’m just along for the ride now
I hate x mas. Eff the new year. 


OPEN THE DAMN MARKETS
Get to the back of the line...
I rode those +60 25C down to zero! Merry Christmas you filthy animals.
What was position
What's west of the west coast but still in the same timezone?
Short term I think it will drop to 80 see what happens then
Since ‘plant-handling’ companies can’t be publicly traded in the US, I think WeedMaps is going to be a really popular pick 👍
Ugh they blocking the stimulus again, back to 3-4 months of talks
Imagine not buying those ARK dips today 🤣
Damn
Thats Revolut and it doesnt have options. Only stocks
It needed a pull back.  It's been ripping.  Plus there was something today about SQ buying Tidal.
24 year old company that no one uses anyways. SQ and Paypal are better
How
At the worst times

Unless they changed it it was 4 days before lol
At the high point. I’ve become quite skilled at it.

Yeah I bought some stocks, it will go up, but it might be a while.

Oh boy
Stfu and go play with yourself. He’s not a fucking financial advisor. You go on Reddit and make decisions at your own risk. Post your losses or gtfo and stop bitching
Why do you say this is a pump?  Just curious.  You can easily google all the news on steel and supply chain issues.
Positions?
I see. Well I hope we both win. Cheers mate
Demand will slow, sure. But homebuilders have been much more conservative since ‘08. Maybe I’m looking at it through rose colored lenses, but there’s a lot of new construction going on right now that’s being built on demand. Very different scenario from the last go around because builders aren’t left with their dick in their hand and a bunch of spec homes they can’t sell.
Didn't know today was a half day. Closed a risky position like 30 seconds before closing by coincidence (although a second one is open and will fuck me on Monday)

Marry Xmas you god damn degenerates.
-0.0073 lol
Jaydon 4 mod
Do we not make a new thread when the markets close on a half day? Is this because zeejayzee quit yesterday? They won’t let me say his name
PSTH calls r so juicy. gonna be even better when i hold onto one and exercise it 🥺😎🥺😎🥺
Today was a day that institutional investors took the day off and the insane asylum was run by the inmates who in turn sold and took profits because they have paper hands.
So many retards losing money because they didn’t know the market close early today 😂

UK tanked prices with their covid-20 but saved us with a brexit deal. I've got conflicting emotions about our tea bagging brothers across the atlantic
BABA isn't a bad buy if you have a longer term horizon like 6 months  or more.  If you are trading weekly FDs well, that's a different story.

Did you buy the warrants on AP.XT?
i closed at the top thank god
It’s ok just hold. 225 EOY.
shit volume/OI what u mean?

OI should be higher then volume when eyeing positions like that
This.  The man pomps the everloving shit out of our stocks every chance he gets, even our shitty SPACs lately.

He kneels and worships before the altar of Su Bae and even named his late dog Nvidia. Pretty much every single day he mentions a CEO appearance on his show, that company’s stock will moon.

Only people shit talking Cramer are newer people hating something trying to fit in cause hating shit is cool.
Made $8000 today on $26k
The global casino is closed for Christmas! Try to enjoy the holiday, doing nothing meaningful for the next 3 days and 1/2! 🤡
You’re right.. I did
Needs a catalyst. WSB projections were Q1 - Q2 in 2021. 

I'll keep holding shares as this shit rises even without squeeze and I kinda want to see GME succeed.

Merry Christmas my dude.
Way to stick it to those commies
I want to bang Sara Eisen

Need GME to drop like a rock next week!
SPACs usually decide their trend in the first week. I bought some shares just in case. Lemonade and Porch Group seem to do entirely different things, but if the housing market lasts, I don't see why this can't double.
😩 all in on PLTR, but fuck. I had to delete my Robinson after today to prevent emotional selling.
beware of ENPH, price is WAY too high imo. unsustainable
Because we’re going to get the $600 stimulus and Trump was just trying to look like a good guy and distract from horrifically corrupt pardons without actually doing anything.
**HOW MANIPULATED IS THIS MARKET..** last 20 minutes spy goes from 367 to 369!?? Also I’m a bull but
That isn’t good news. Long way down when we could have started the climb back to 369 on Monday 🙄
Nice grab.

Agreed.
Lmao

The wider economy is in a bull run, therefore IBM is also within the bull run, it is a underperforming stock, for sure, but it's part of a global bull run.
does this include baba?
Mvis calls had a part to do with it
I bought too. Up 25 percent. Thanks sir jack!!!!
My man, hopefully it catches some volume on Monday
This would be more fun if on up days, someone handed me my profits in cash.
Palantir is such a dope name for a company
Robinhood is the worst mobile game I’ve played in a while
Bruh that shit is going to go sideways. The only thing that will move it up is if they win the investigation. Until that’s over, I wouldnt touch it.
How does this work? I downloaded the code, but have no idea on how to use it...
making good plays nice
It might be my mistake since what I thought I saw was he moved 100% of his liquidity into STIC, and then posted the gains bragging that they're locked in. My assumption is based on the # of shares he has compared to the movement that occurred around 9-10 AM EST. I do see some other comments supporting this but again, maybe it's a mistake on my part.
When do you guys tend to enter your day trades?

People would need to be convinced that keeping that extra 10% of their check would benefit themselves and the country more then the government taking it. I don’t really think it’s possible, people are really stupid. Milton Friedman died trying lmao.

what company are you talking about here? BarkBox?
Either way my friend!  Best of wishes works too, and that is my wish from me to you.  Enjoy the break and get those dusty bowls washed and filled with something for Santa.
Merry fucking Christmas retards, take care
😀
You were supposed to buy the dip end of day to enjoy a full week of deliscious tendies starting Monday 😋
What amuses me is this video has been out for years, yet people in this sub claim to not know anything about the company. Goes to show how little research people do, even for the lowest of hanging fruit like YT videos.
Been sitting on a $29C for a month, this checks out
Santa
PLTR and NIO shall indeed...fly again 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Portfolio margin :) 

I'm sure you can sell puts without being cash covered on tasty with a regular margin account.. look into upgrading your margin account, maybe you missed something
now's a good time to buy tesla shares and sell calls on them. (Or sell put spreads / IC)

tesla is going to be way more stable going forward but there's still relatively high IV as a remnant from before, so cash in on that before the Iv drops.

BRB forking this and making my own for swing day trading options
Not gonna lie my head did hurt. So I laid down and thought a little harder. I can't believe I messed up such simple math. It's actually 5x not 4x. 

In all seriousness though, I don't think I explained the 'gap' in the marketplace clearly. I will write this more clearly today.
I need to use it. I have a grand in there 😂
I hope everyone pre ordered today for mondays rally
You went the opposite direction. Most people here go from $100,000 in the bank with a nice house. To $4 in their wallet behind a Wendy’s sucking Dick for tendies

Thanks, both my parents died on Christmas when I was 12
I still need to look more into that. Seen a couple posts about it

Who did she piss off at CNBC
MARKETS CLOSED BITCH
He's called out the Robin Hood reddit traders many times on CNBC and on interviews for being irresponsible gamblers (he's not wrong).  He refuses to use the term "Wall Street Bets" even though there have been quite a few callers on the show who say they're from WSB.
Yes the retard is strong with this one
If u can’t wait for the 4 day clear to buy options on tdameritrade, buy a stock sell it next day and you’ll be able to buy options with that money.
Yup, all sorts of good things coming for semiconductors next year. I’m in MU and ENPH now, really hoping for a good breakout.
Me too he’s in my DMs
Down 5.5k in two days but still up 30k on the month. Ain’t even mad. Loaded up for next week/month.

Went deep on $HIMX today. 100 03/15/2020 $7 calls a s 5,000 total shares. I feel it in my soul.
Already bought some a couple days ago and sadly my German broker doesn’t offer options which is kinda retarded I know but I’m just getting started and will probably switch to another broker next year.
Lol you would bitch about losing money on a stock that someone else talked about. What, did you think you could just come here play internet lawn darts with stocks and you’d become rich? Lol go spend 10k hours looking at charts and then go fund yourself.
This is not the way of the Holiday Spirit.
Well I lost all my money but at least I learned a lesson about ahh Christmas or something
I want to invest but the app I use in the UK (freetrade) doesn't list them.

I bought a few cause they were cheap. 

I've got $20 12/31 and $23 12/31, as well as .50 1/21/22 for the long haul,  as well as roughly 40 shares
But jews are white too
Can’t wait to see my December statement. It’s gonna be a hot mess.
That’s terrible, you know he can’t afford them anymore
Theres plents with 5 digit shares
China fucked me good today but the NIO leaps I picked up on sale will be my revenge
Lol. Who here expired worthless today?
X already ran like 60+% this year...
I have a lot of room, GME buys at $3 made my account near half mill. ATVI buys were at $75. GOOGL at $1600 and today with BABA
SSPK boys don't miss out. It's weed and technology.
Reeeeeeeeecap of today's market driving news:

* After POTUS' surprise backlash against the stimulus bill, rightly making fun of the bigly lame $600 check - House Dems moved quickly to try and pass the $2,000 amount they've been trying to secure now that POTUS has made a very public statement on it. McTurtle, now put into a no-win situation has been trying to weasel out of it by political maneuvering. GOP and House GOP is now pointing to foreign spending cut as a means to push back and "secure" the $2,000 amount to Americans. House Dems are moving to another vote on Monday now that today's vote was blocked by House GOP. Meanwhile, as the bill stays stalled on POTUS's desk, the likelihood of a govt shutdown and lapse in UI payments for the 12 million unemployed Americans increases. Good times all around!
* China, after making various antitrust statement in the past months has finally made good on their threat as they launch an antitrust probe on BABA. Shares of BABA drilled 9% in HK market and was down as much as 17% in US market during intraday low to $211. It'll be interesting to see if this will have actual material impact for BABA once the dust settles, but given how they blocked Ant's IPO, something is likely to come out of this instead of some unknown internal political posturing. BABA closed down -13.34% to $222. Shares of rival PDD is up big on the news, closing the day out up almost 9% to $152.75, while JD is down slightly -1.10% to $84.49.
* In WSB meme stock land, GME closed with red day, pulling back slightly to end the day at -2.04% to close at $20.15. RIP to all those that went all-in on $21c and $22c FDs this week and didn't take gains. MT continues to trade fairly flat as its a long-play, once again, don't buy weeklies you dumb fuck. PLTR also close out red for the day, down -3.28% back to the cursed $27 range to close at $27.75. TSLA was able to close out its first week of S&P trading on a green day, though its down overall for the week. TSLA closed up 2.44% at $661.77 after reversing from a fairly red opening yesterday morning.
* The market edged out a green day yet again, with Dow up 0.2%, S&P up 0.4%, and Nasdaq up 0.3%. It's Christmas Eve and the market has closed early, so if you're still hoping to get out of your 0dte FDs then you've done fucked up. Market closes tomorrow on Christmas day and no doubt the 3 day weekend will force WSB to yet again have an existential crisis as they wonder what they've been doing all year long and why haven't they become a TSLA/GME/insert-ticker-that-hasn't-sucked millionaire yet.

(Yesterday's recap: none, because I was lazy)
I’m going to stick to that rule next time I’m up to it. Conversely I did manage to buy SE 1/15 calls on big discount (which was one of my trades) so maybe I’ll make some of it back
Bought baba at 220
Half day for Christmas eve.
I thought they were doing a separate bill just for stimulus checks?
Says the post and the account is deleted, but because of the management on this SPAC, fk it im in  


No but actually, strong buy. Same reasoning that went into IPOC before any news of clover health was out.
Same
gaaay
Well.... I’m finally positive YTD.
And I’m only down 60% all time.
Honestly, it feels pretty good to be digging my way out.
That’s awesome dude keep doin what you do and spreading the word
Covid 20 and probably another v2 virus pandemic is bullish for stocks.
Watch this algorithm somehow fuck up and everyone goes broke as is tradition
And here I thought BABA was my safest holdings 🤡
Just hold man those are not bad plays
Usually there’s a big move end of day. If it moves against the direction you want to trade, you can get in at a good price. Also, it’s like the end of a chapter if you’re planning on trading off of a thesis that won’t kick in until after market close it’s the latest you can buy.
Lol, forgot I was in central time again and missed the close. Merry Christmas you dumbasses
How we feeling about our QQQJ calls?
 If I lose you win. But yours are 100% more likely. I own like 350 stocks tho, so any gain is great for me.
where is the promised gme short squeeze?
TSLA mooning next week. Stimmy talks failing brings $ back to GROWTH STONKS
Imagine if markets were just open for 10 mins a day. The volatility would be insane. You'll have a chance to get rich or go broke every trading day.
What app is that? PLTR put was nice.

[deleted]
You're right and I also do see that he was on around 2ish PM EST. The stock barely moved during the 2 hours left before the closing bell. Maybe there was a staggered amount of time between his interview on CNBC and movement on the stock, but when I also compare it to XL's 86% rise yesterday, that was due to Citron's report, not the actual CEO's interview when the market opened.
Has been freed for a long time
Ahahaha wtf is this interview lol
You get the leftovers Noone wants for cheap

Daahhhhahhaooown

When will the GME shorts have to cover?
[removed]
Not sure, but you could look at his recent tweets. Just people saying why did you pump Baba and it’s down now blah blah blah, he’s not talking about us. If he was actually insulted by the shit people in WSB say he would have said this a long time ago lol
Wow 6 out of a million+ inoculations sell everything
yeah I don't think there's any cause for concern here my man; drink a spiked eggnog and relax
Santa Rally starts Monday sir
I’m looking at you PFE!!
Idealistically yeah.

I remember when Clinton started cutting down on military bases.  People had a shit fit.

Only one in recent memory to have a budget that was projected to be balanced.

If we got closer back to that then yeah it may be more practical.

But how you do start cutting Medicare and the rest?
How does one reach peak retardation please tell us

every day the market is open is my channukah, christmas, and kwanza rolled into a nice fat blunt 🐴
I don't understand, the majority of posts here were positive about Cramer. I still inverse him though because he made me lose a ton of money in my first ever trade.
Merry Christmas you filthy animals!

Today was a good day to buy into pltr. I would have bought more if I wasn't already 150k deep
No stimmy. Y market no crash
Well, fuck this day.  See you autists Monday AM.

Happy December Holidays
Ya, that’s what I do just to be safe. Just thought maybe there was a secret I didn’t know.
Not bad, double the losses in half the time

Sounds about right. Although even if the deal ends up being net negative for the U.K. which I think will be the case, hopefully 2021 has to be better than 2020...?!

And I got it so wrong on the announcement, GBP dropped by like 50 cents as the press conference was happening so my $1.36 calls expired worthless 🤦‍♀️

Never touching fx again.

Have a great Christmas break!
Ugh 3 days of family and holidays with no markets. *barfs*
i think he got unbanned
SQ burying itself into the ground while all the major indices fly. Of course I bought calls at the top
For holding the line and going down 13%, we'll be rewarded with up 2% on Monday :D
I **ca**n do some puts a**ll** day
It's about to be a long boring weekend
Yeah... I thought it was gonna move up more, but learned my lesson. Never traded a Christmas week before. At least lots of my index funds will help make up for a loss within the year if I have to take one.
That’s weird...What’s the expiration on those? I had ToS do something like that where they said I entered an order but they couldn’t provide the evidence...
Buy high sell low
I bought at the peak, but instead of crying i just started buying more as it dropped. I had 3x my initial position when it bottomed out, now im laughing. 🌚🚀🚀🚀
Heads up boys. 

Santa has something big in the works for us...
And that will never change. Which is why we should give them less money. This is where we disagree, you believe the government can be fixed, I believe it is more or less impossible for one person to spend another persons money efficiently, which is essentially what the government does. Nobody spends my money better then me, nobody spends your money better then you.
It’s one of the retards here moving to Twitter since Cramer “told” everyone to buy BaBa at $260. Always inverse Cramer.
No
Nobody does, its univerally despised
All I know I bought 100 185ps expiring 12/31 yesterday for $100 total and sold them this morning for $40 apiece. Problem is they keep going up and I hate myself
BABA gonna end this thread of it slides to sub 200!!!!!!!
Been freed apparently
Merry Christmas guys

Thanks for this year my, dudes. Won some, lost all of it and now clawing my way back.

Stay cool ✌
The only thing I would report him for is chronic masturbation
You look like you kept buying short term options.....
Lol who’s your broker? On thinkorswim they will be assigned this evening.
I want my money back
We didn’t ask for your help Cramer! But, please pump NIO and PLTR.
British people go on holiday. So Merry Christmas

Dude they both have big news in January don’t paper hand you bitch
Wish I could get this to work from the comfort of my phone. Thanks for sharing OP 🚀

Edit: spelling
Drink a cup of salt water. My goodness. My wife had me do that once and I was sprayin' for an hour straight
Ah shit was hoping a Christmas special DD would go for some banter but alas, see you all next week
Your sample size for a working algorithm is 5 companies? Largely in the same sector, in the same bull run?
For PERI? Growth was slow. Now growth has been revamped especially with connected TV. Same for MGNI
good lesson lol albeit a bit expensive!

I keep 0DTE's ITM and almost always don't enter til an hour til close for power hour shit
Just stay alive then pussy
After hours
1100 shares at $6.80 yesterday.
Until 3pm est.

Greedy fkin mms pinning pltr below 28
[deleted]
man nothings moving now, what a boring day
I think he was born
The only reason I am up today is because of SIRJACKALOT. Free him 😡😡🚀
What’s a 10 dollar percentage
The memes are QUALITY.
Everyone shows themselves
Irs okay homie you made profit, now if you wanna get back in sell cash secured puts at your cost basis. Thetagang calls this the wheel.
Okay you dummies, I've had a hell of a month with SPACs and I just spent some profits on 200 shares of GME and 200 shares of PLTR, since they're both red today.

You've been posting about this bullshit nonstop for a month, at least make me some fucking Money while I'm scrolling past the wall of posts 🙏
Definitely. Both times like ~$300k over a few days
Who bought puts at BABA LOD?  Me.  Fml
Less tax $ for Uncle Scam, winning
Is Cramer on tonight?
All these fucking SPACs just 2x for no reason, SEC needs to curb these mergers bypassing IPOs
Portfolio is full of spy puts! The end times come next week
[removed]
You lost out on a GME call? In 2020??
Yeah I don’t mind holding this long term but the share lockout ending in February has me wanting to take profits. But I got in at 14, so might not be worth it
I’m hoping to make some gains on my 1/15 VALE calls and put it all in to MegaTendies 🚀🚀🚀🚀
lol did you buy FDs?
Alright raise your hand if you yolo’d on BABA
[removed]
LET ME INNNN!!!
[deleted]
I was his manager.
I like the shorter trading day. You get both volatile hours and a much shorter period of nothingness
[deleted]
Yeah, I grabbed a couple more positions. Now I'm done Christmas shopping and I'm now I'm content to hold. Happy Holidays.
Fuck me for buying these shit calls on shit stocks. 

https://imgur.com/a/FWlBnJN
Lol I know man. Sorry :\
Yeah so why isn't it in the goddamn picture? I need confirmation that my position is in the outer orbit.
Same reason they buy and sell at open. To gamble, obviously
to make money off the gap up or down the next day
It all gets better from here bro trust me I diamond handed because I know this game. January is going to be an insane bullrun for these stocks.
What a fucking pussy. Imagine being on wallstreet where you have access to hookers and cocaine every day but you let this affect you
You can pre-pay an estimate. It's similar to withholding from paychecks where you give the IRS a percent estimate and then do the full scale accounting once the paperwork is final
Both
I mean I’m up 25% for the week 🤗
Cost basis $4.19 on mine. Bought weeks ago when it was back at 92 still. Wbu?
People with even less brain cells
[deleted]
Noone could've predicted the BABA shit. Poor guy.
HELL NO
They’ll exercise if they are itm by a penny. It’s not instantaneous
I think they will survive, but that's because I also invested in it.

It's a gamble what can I say.
If we count my calls I got you beat lol
ive tried to read some really retarded shit before, this was the most unreadable
Ackman gets called a clown for this one, in reality its the entire market that should be insulted because everything he said about Herbalife is true. Something like ~1% of all Herbalife sellers make a profit. It really is a scheme and Ackman was 100% right. Unfortunately the market can remain irrational longer than you can stay solvent.
Fucking aye mate
🚀🚀🚀
Watch metals fly now that you cant buy any calls
[deleted]
Yeah
LMAO, and look at what happened EOD. That light volume dump that happened all day got ate up in a single 5 minute candle.
Anyone here in Mvis calls?
I JUST started calls last week, take a look at trading monthly or yearly calls on the ETF TAN. With the Biden administration I think we will continue seeing a huge bump in solar.
Next year will be far worse
They already do that. Raise taxes and close the loop holes. Where are they going to go? Europe, where the EU is going after them? 

They want the protections of being US companies and operating in our legal system, they should pay their fair share.
Merry Christmas you filthy fuckin animals
I see that goverment ordered 140 dollar hit contract on your head.
He recommended BABA at the top, now when it’s at the bottom he’s screeching to sell. That’s the help he provides
Awwww shit.  Spy is really about to hit 380 on Monday on stimmy hopes isn't it...
Wasn't he also pumping $W?  -15% in the last 2 days.
damn your timing is on point
Im down 30k lolololol
Lol
I hope for you that this will be the new support. I'm glad u had the chance to get in at such a discount... I'd like to buy the dip but I'm broke af
Holy shit I thought the market closed @ 2pm and now I am for sure FUCKED.
When it’s down like this it’s a discount dawg
Wtf market closed already
Gains a gain :)
#Don’t forget to eat your green bean casserole
0 share. I win
Ladies and gentleman, the casino is closed for today. Please cash in your chips in orderly fashion.

If you have lost money and you owe money to the house, you will be escorted by casino’s security staff to the room in the back. Merry Christmas
I would love to see ticker $XXX on my screen... Until Elon would start tweeding again and I'd have to sell my soul to cover bessa... Again
Ah damn
Retards are attacking Cramer? Smh kids today
why dont you open a margin account, they dont get taxed as much on capital gains, if you make any lol
We both can agree there.

The government is terrible at managing budgets.  And yes the small guys get the shaft vs corporations.  Which is completely shi tty.  Ideally they would increase funds and incentives to small businesses over corporations but lobbying ensures they always get the fatter part of the pork spending.
Lol I ended up +22.44
Oh look, we now both have the same amount of money in our account
[deleted]
🤡>🎅
Merry Christmas or Happy Holidays? Which one is politically correct?
[deleted]
But im not done trading :(
X
This ... have you noticed how expensive pedigree puppies have gotten over the last decade? especially for breeds like french bulldogs, and pugs. Good breeders have waiting lists.

Young professionals have increasingly been getting expensive dogs in lieu of having children.
PLTR is my most bullish position. But we ain’t seeing anything over 30 until at least January 1st.
Yea I got cocky after a solid week. Not worth it.
Stop shilling that garbage
Just put aside 25-30% and don’t fuggin touch it
[removed]
saw that and was like fuck, but glad out before eod, also flipped some shares at 222 from 218
This ^^^^
wait. there is still extended hours on christmas eve?
Woah good work either way. I've done all in one stock and always feel so antsy.  Its easy for it to move either direction.  Have you gotten burned doing that?
I would use the villagers as skipping stones.
[deleted]
Why do you guys buy end of day? What's the advantage?
Little
The one who said the christmas run will be a green one and full of tendies.. show yourself
I'm proud of all you, way to close the week above 20$ my fellow 💎 handy artists
[deleted]
i'd be more comfortable with 240 as a lotto, but I don't see it dropping more on no news either so 🗿
congrats and fuck you
542 shares in GME. Whose got me beat?
Predictions for 12/31?
[deleted]
always trust your feelings
You’re gonna fry on Monday .. lmfao and you fool SPAC merger run ups are the easiest money in the game right now
You will get exercised by Sunday, it's not instant haha

The true value of gme is like 35 a share.

Cramer for mod?
Market is closed tomorrow.
By 1/15/21? If what you say comes true, my portfolio will be in a very happy place. I have a shitload of ABNB shares.
Thanks Santa for the 480% gain on SPX yolo 🥰
Of course
Spx closed at 3703, that’s actually a surprise
amzn plz
Yeah I am jacked to the tits right now, same strike and expiry

40x $95c 1/15 as well

If I die, I die.
2k stimmy talks **not** going well :(
Nah man I’ve been hearing about delisting for about 5 year now. Lol
That’s when you get burned. Stay the course. And good job
MT is on a space journey bro 🚀🚀🚀
Merry Christmas you retards!  I gotta go return some presents.
keep 0DTE ITM if you must at least.

Tbh 0DTE is fucking pointless, you should have enough BP kicking around to at least day trade the next Friday's expiries
Down 3k 😀
i meant this exact moment after early close lol
Merry Christmas all, see you Monday.
Lose your entire account 6 times learning options.
It’s been a good year for me: https://i.redd.it/g9gf3qnoc6761.jpg

XLK, TAN, ICLN were my biggest gainers, took $25k off and transferred to my savings

Merry Christmas, and happy tendies
Merry christmas everybody.
That isn’t true. Cut social security, cut welfare, cut Medicare, Medicaid, cut the EPA, the FDA, military spending on defense only, no pointless wars, and were a lot closer to 500b then you think.
Cant wait will we can say good bye to 2020. Good lord, this was a shitty year all around
Ass chowder
Happy Holidays guys. I made $38 today, going to treat myself to a decent bottle of wine tonight 🤷🏽‍♂️
time to take off this clown cosplay and put on an ugly christmas sweater 😀
Apple cucked me so hard today, goddamnit.
Fraction of shares here but in @ 14.23.
Will let it sit until merger and then make decision.

In the mean time approach all millenials with dogs and ask if they've heard about our Lord and Saviour Barkbox.
Nope
Puts are immoral
I call those "yoyos" my fav toy
Yes retard. The market “HALTED”.
PLTR back on it's way to $25 before 🚀 to $28 and then back down to $25...

This is the Circle of Life
I paused day trading today when I saw where things were headed. 

I’m in rough shape but hopefully next week gives me some gains.  Decided to 🙌💎 and hold. Hoping GME isn’t a bust.

MVIS  OI puts at 6 are almost double the calls for January. Trying to push the price down. Load the fuck up on the cheap. This company has great things going for it.
[deleted]
In at 216.87 tee hee
NIO/XPEV, please don’t fuck this up further. I’m already 24% down on fucking XPEV... $ROPE
Should I have sold my calls yesterday
Should be illegal to be able to sell stonks on Xmas Eve.  only buy orders go through
Lost $300 lmao
Have faith?
u grow up in a closet?
BABA bag holders will be rewarded Monday
Thank you Santa for the rally, very cool
A fine day for day trading tbh. Big and fast swings all over the place. There are more strategies than just buy call and hope it goes up
You have been banned from twitch
I bought some. I don’t think it will hit that price by 31 but I’m hoping to scalp a profit.
Lost 8k today. What a great way to start Christmas. At least I’m still up for the week :( not a loss till ya sell right. Fuckin Amazon and nio
Lol they made sure $AAPL closes under 132 for their covered calls. We run on Monday 📈🚀
Thanks, now my orders of random seeds are going to take two months instead of one.

get fukt chit is only going up from here
Anyone else load up on SPY puts before close?
I think aapl falls to 115 within 3 months.
I had 2 covered calls that have been ITM for a few days. They expire today. The market just closed, but it still shows me with the calls, and I still have the shares. Did I just get super lucky, and they didn't get exercised? I've never been called before.
How do I do this ?
GUH
Today was a good day. BLNK rallied when it needed to most
Well that was fucked
Shit bro :-(

I'll light a candle for you
FRHC
i was scrambling to make a move before 1 but couldn’t get it done

reeeeeeeee

alright what’s a $1k play for monday
Yup
Shit I bought the 40 strike
Ideally I’d like it to jump to the mythical 40 before EoY so I can sell for Mr. Taxman
Lmao
Finished today down 4%. Not that bad right
I don't need to believe because he exsists
I have some very conservative debit spreads just because it tends to trade within a range for weeks. But hopeful it will run up
Up 11k today selling puts to you guys. Stonks only go up

Competition is good. Also, why the fuck not, who says Steam, Epic and a few others are the only ones worthy enough to capture the entirety of the market?
Does this mean I have to pay attention to my family now?
why did I even type that in to see if it was a real company bruh...
Steel godfather what do you think about my 3/19/31 $28 calls? Should I hold or roll them up to April
THIS SHIT REALLY JUST CLOSED WOW
See you incels, cucks and tards next week
i did EoD just to make some money back, and fuck yeah, it worked, but i think it took like 6 years off my life
Wut ticker?
FCEL and yes
BIG green DILDO at end of day
Market is closed tommorw bud . Monday we see a $10% RIP
SQQQ calls. Tons of them. Ready to watch the market tank?
Only being down like 8k today feels like a win

HOHOHO!
So you think Mitch McConnell will be huge on he green energy, huh? I’ll take the other side of that bet.

Dear Diary, I lost tons again today.
You too bro
yea same here but i think pepole are overeacting a little

shet hit nearly $212 lmao thats like even below last decembers market price

i lost the opportunity to jump in a gud price 2day but i think we can expect more bad news in the short future which might drive the price at around $230 or below

i have a feelin pooh and the gang are just gonna break jacks kneecap to show him and the other china companies wat happens when they try to fk with the gang
Children?
Aslong as it wasn't weeklies

Down $777 today, good omen?
A small price to pay for salvation.
No chrimbus special miracle for me, thanks a lot tim and eric
Loaded to the plums with BABA 1/15 130p.  Xmas / New Years yolo premium flip.  I think the market is going to shit on this one a bit more.
Which one of you insulted my boy Cramer? https://mobile.twitter.com/jimcramer/status/1342164016911806464?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Etweet

Cramer come back baby, we love you here
Christmas may have been bad but I got a good feeling about New Years 💵💵💵💵💵🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Went from up ~60% for the week to up 11% cause I can’t help but fuck myself with puts 🤡

ARKG for my 2020 ira?
Good grief
Wow living in the west coast must suck
lmaoo david tepper took a yuge position in MU when it was in the 40s a few months ago. I knew it was time to go long again, but wanted to be a fgt and play weeklies on mega tech
I keep waiting for abcl to find support but it just keeps bleeding. Fuck
howd that go?
Welp lads and gals have a good 4 days to decompress
Same
yes sir yes sir three bags full
Made a shit ton off TSLA today. Sold and now I’m balls deep on NIO and BABA leap calls.

China Gang Rise Up!!!! 🚀
Fav stock long term?
Look at the chart it'll plateau for a week and then dump
Got in on NIO for the (potential) run up. And an ARKG leap. 

Still 💎 🙌 GME 2022 calls.
For Xmas movies, I recommend Die Hard, Lethal Weapon, and Trading Places
Good game out there today boys. We almost had em. PLTR gang still hanging in there.
Congrats on your $23.84 gain
Bot more Chers
Merry Fucking Christmas Mofos! Market closed :( at least for me

I bought calls when it was at 212 and got IV crushed the past 2 hours. I’m hoping for a 10% rippper tomorrow.
So the Santa Clause rally was a fucking lie...
Fair enough! Hoping for the best.
He looks like a low rent gay porn fluffer fuck boy
2 grand does
No
Merry Christmas everyone!
That end of day green candle is good news for next week hopefully.
Lesson learned.
Down 3.5 percent today womp womp
PLTR to the earth...
I’m not sure 35 months of giving homeless blowjobs is worth the 100k
what about $TAN?
If you look at PLTR’s one month chart you can see a giant wedge forming, likely 1-2 weeks of slight downward movement and then we’re flying.
Buy MSFT 🤓🤓🤓🤓
Casino is closed you phaggots. Go enjoy Christmas with your wives and their boyfriends and I’ll see you degenerates Monday morning.
EVERYTHING HALTED?!
Yeah fuck today. Have a good weekend y’all.
Redistribute some profits to homeless people if you can. I feel so bad for these these bastards, it’s fucking freezing in the midwest
You jump to conclusions as daytraders make decisions lightly. Pump and Dumps are not one day affairs and he'd have to be trying to turn it into a meme stock to be guilty of that.
Thank god it closed early, all i saw today was a continuous bleed down in my portfolio
Yeah that tax scheme was proposed before and the problem is the tax revenue wouldn’t cover spending and would result in larger deficit, inflation, or unproductively increase sales tax.

Again you can’t run a government on 500b or less.
Time to sit under the Xmas tree doing nothing until Monday
...and ARKG
Not even letting it stay over 29.  27-28 just stuck in the mud
Had 2k cash left and used it on baba dont feel great about it
[deleted]
position or go fuck yourself
Took a giant shit after watching BABA today. Puts on my anal health
I understand what you’re saying, I also care about people and business’ but frankly I’m not convinced the government is the solution to our problems. I’m convinced they’re the problem. The government, the way its set up, is always going to give more of the benefits to their donors, and friends, so the small guy will get left out. Better to allow the market decide then the government, more fair, more efficient.

I do remember that, I disagree with those bailouts as well. What is a bailout? They take our taxpayer money and give it to the farmer right, so, why not, we just keep our money, and the farmers charge more for their product, and we pay more. 

Because the military is global, operating in multiple wars all over the world at any given time. Ever listen to Eisenhower’s speech on the military industrial complex? It’s a good listen.
Same. Cash gang didn’t last long. YOLO
It’s such a weird feeling to have your trading day end at 8am :/
holy fuck these are some ugly buys

except BABA tho probably
MERRY FUCKING CHRISTMAS RETARDS
cant explain that
spoke too soon. biggest transactions of the session are all sells at close
Guys... I’d love to tell you to hop in easy wins next week like FCEL, FUBO, MGNI, and plug.

But come on.. these are the easiest run ups to $20 you’ll ever see 

**G H I V** 

**I P O C**
my 5 mins BABA fds didn't work lol
Call the ambulance, but not for me
Sir, you just played a bad hand of poker.
you guys turning u/vitocorlene into a meme 😂

I verified independently your statements and found them to be true. $MT is to date the third largest underlying in my portfolio while I wait for it to pop. So far it has been teetering on mild losses. Same pattern of $PLTR in late September. 
Position: 2000 stock and 100 1/22 25c
See you on the moon! 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Thank you
Live a little bro. AAPL 125/128 or 130.
Welcome brother
What an awful fucking day. Red everywhere . Santa u fuk
thank god markets finally closed i can finally stop clenching my asshole
Hope people do their own dd and not fall for the mt pump
well done boys, good bear bashing
rip to the people who still trying to day trade. lol
Merry Christmas Lads - see you next week and let’s go make some new year tendies
Never gonna stop being funny.
Who ever swung baba calls with me ✌🏻We eating steak on Monday . I REPEAT BABA WILL OPEN AT $260 Monday
This is the way
Somehow I ended green today. +23.84
Ended green marginally LOL
Nice
Switch to fin tech

Interesting close
I'll be dead in 100 days
New bill will be passed in Jan 2021 that will propel all green energy stocks. I will make a DD post about it, but for now get Panasonic, SunRun, and SunPower stocks. They are going to the moon in January
did the opposite haha
the wick on baba's candle has convinced me to buy in

wheeee
do not do this then
Anyone think BABA 12/31 250c still possible?
[removed]
I’m glad the squeeze happened
I got in at 216 today. We will see if I just lost some money. The dip was too juicy to pass up

Stressful shits? A little colon cleanse in your coffee will smooth things out.
REEEEE BABA FUCKED ME REEEEE
We just need to wear him down until he doesn't care about anything anymore. Just like we do to all new members.
I like it, but the security of April/Jun may do this favors in my opinion, but anything can happen as we have seen!
It’s over
Game Over
who got SPY calls for next week?
Buy the dip retard
i mean I'm down cause I sold ITM put credits today lol

Just saying there's tons of downside risk still
[removed]
Go on MU ya glorious basterd
Holy fuck its a real tweet. You're a grown man Jimmy, stop embarrassing yourself.
Santa hates Cathie Wood.  FUCK U SANTA
Just wait till all options expire at end of year.
Hope you did!  ARKK going to make us rich!
It hit 20.21 for a moment.  Are you a wizard?

What a fucking day lol  
happy holidays fam
Honest question, how can you file in Jan when the paperwork from the broker won’t be sent out till mid-Feb?
Is it over yet?
gotta love it!
Ok fuck it, I'm in both for shares. I will share in the WSB Journey. 🙏
Lost like 1600 trying to trade zero day. Guh
#Pencils down
He’s talking about people on Twitter calling him out for BABA and shit I’m pretty sure, nobody here actually insults Cramer like that
I bet the people selling Xpeng in the 40s are the same dummies who bought at the top
bout tree fiddy
Just get ass railed by everything I touch
Thanks
We should send him lube and a giant red dildo
Hey man just chill out
Bro lay off Cramer he is one of us
Took the fattest L this last three hours 🥴🥴🥴🥴
Merry Christmas, ya filthy animals...
✏️ dicks down!
Oof that IV and low volume on what I thought was discount calls on BABA
Get the cucking of a lifetime if there’s another slide
I’m jacked to the tits going into this weekend
What does that even mean
$200
Bull gang rise up
PENISES DOWN MERRY CHRISTMAS FUCKERS!!!
This will be my first time trading options, I mean I know I’m retarded enough to be here, but just to confirm it: $30 call for MT on 4/16/21 is the way to go yes?
Thats it. Spent all my money on the dip.

PLTR, GME, BABA, AI, FUSE, XL

basically the same thing that keeps dragging me down.
Merry Christmas!  

My ass hurts from today! 🥳🎅
Wont happen. China wants their version of GOOG, AAPL, MSFT in the world stage. The government wants that. 

So stop with the fear mongering. Name a single company that Xi’s government tore apart with BABA’s size. You can’t. All they have done is to fuel the growth of mega companies and they will continue to so. It’s good for China and their economy and move towards the world stage.

Unless Xi plans on kidnapping Jack Ma and make him disappear, BABA will be BABA
STOP THE COUNT
All I want for Christmas is AMD to hit $100 next week.

That is literally all I fucking want...
stock price is too high imo
I’m up lol. Bought BABA calls at 217
I thought that shit said 4 million and I almost cried
Real men bought the BABA dip , gay frogs was playing with penny stocks / GME / PLTR / SPACS
I think he was just retarded and didn't type it correctly. Usually people denote options by their expiration date and strike price(and c for calls and p for put) Ex. AAPL 1/15 $145c means an apple call option with a strike price of $145 expiring on the 15th of january
Just clench your butt cheeks, buy TSLA leaps and believe in your messiah Elon Musk
Ofc MU pumping at close after I get out
I’ll take it. The adrenaline high made me feel like a god though.
Apple's been poaching Tesla and Cruise engineers for a few years now. I thought it was well known that they were entering the field? They just don't have anything ready yet
Lmfao Xpeng at 42 really?? This market is so over dramatic I love it. Guess that’s the free money play then right now. Calls and DCA it is thank you paper hands
[removed]
But, you’d have $394,500.
doubled down on the dip for my calls
Yep
Im in for april 27 C
Well that was fucking brutal
Baba $250
Bought 275 shares today. Lets see what happens.
Let’s go mvis
Losing $100 makes you hard?
Alright so who else bought that BABA dip 🤚
You cant short the vix. You can long puts or short calls.

Let’s wait and see, we cant make conclusions on where the stock ends yet . But he clearly used misleading statements regarding the stock yesterday, that’s a fact?

I'm never opening robinhood again.  So 3k is my maximum loss
This Christmas I wish Santa rims RH’s asshole sooo hard so it stops with the 1d old news that keep coming back
How cool is this pump knowing good and well that bill isn’t getting passed today and likely getting vetoed before Monday. 🤡
I swear PLTR is just staying pinned under 30 until all options expire worthless. MM are fuk
Power 5 minutes
Have already lost 3k trying to do this. You can give it a go but be warned that volume has been very low. Very easy for MM to pump only a couple thousand shares to keep price higher than strike price.
Faith
If you bought 2 years out, why do you care that it went down 8% in 2 weeks? That's nothing. And even with the 2 months IV crush, you got 2 years man. If you bought near the money you should be fine. Give it at least 8 months to a year, or be down >50% before giving up on it!
Up 25k
I wouldn’t either
Lots of things could make it go up. RC buys shares, some shorts decided to cover, RC takes over, good Q4. Lots of possibilities
I'm sure they found ALL the cases. LOL
50 big ones? I bet you believe in Santa again. Ho ho ho.
Bad move, Christmas cheer will continue into Monday, wait til it clears 370 at least
Lambos are primarily made from aluminum and carbon fiber, soooo....

But! Hyundai uses more steel in their vehicles than most other manufacturers (because they make their own steel, duh!), so, maybe Hyundais are the steel horses we'll ride into valhalla, all shiny and chrome like?

OK.... so essentially investing in PLTR will net you returns not much greater than just investing in the stock market overall? What's your fucking point lol. Is 14% annual returns supposed to be some sort of miracle stock?

Covered on all of them already except the 200p.

Gotta love the bears, they are so retarded they hurt themselves in confusion and just scramble to buy puts at any price
I need in on that to ruin that too
Delicious, thank you
I bought 1/29

Absolutely. "5% co-owners who would drag their balls through a mile of broken glass just to see him cut down a *single* board member to size"
My GME calls decayed to shit today as well. I did sell most of my position yesterday (thank baby jesus even though his bday is tomorrow so he still fetus jesus), but the loss of a thousand still stings :(
Can’t be calling yourself a god at 100k. Maybe a prince

Bought pltr
Buffett’s BRK-B because they own a shit load of AAPL yet it’s not substantially reflected in BRK-B’s price. Plus they own dozens of other great businesses. Plus great pharma names. Plus it’s BRK-B and Buffett. It’s valued like a financial stock struggling with low interest rates - yet it’s so much more. You’re welcome. Don’t sell it.
 BABA black sheep have you any wool?

Lowkey where the hell were you cheerleaders back when GME was $3? What has changed since then? I'm curious whats making a bunch of retards(or autists) see this failing business as a good idea? From the understaffed stores to over 750+ locations closing in the last 2 years. [That number will be 1000 by April](https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2020-12-08-gamestop-has-closed-462-stores-so-far-this-year-783-since-last-year)They dont even own the buildings so the real estate angle is dead. Every single thing they do can be provided by Walmart, Target, or Best Buy. Y'all just riding a hype train like usual? Or is there an actual turnaround plan for this company?  
  
Oh yes - 17P - 7/21.

Impending inauguration is the biggest. Stimulus Bill has a couple green energy investment sections. I think any renewables related comments out of the Biden team will be received well by investors, especially prior to his inauguration.

So that’s why it’s called a broker
low brow content, imo. do you player.
I agree... but there’s no way BABA should have been down 17% earlier.. any intelligent investor should have realized and bought the dip
Loaded BABA to the tits. Lmao people paying 100pe for AMZN with literally EVERYTHING from BABA, but 25 for BABA. Even with commie risk 75% discount? LOL

I got in at PLTR at 25.90 so even tho it’s down today it’s still offsetting my losses I’m currently at like +1% for the day it’s been rough was up like 15% 2 days ago but it’ll all be Gucci by January... just glad I don’t buy options at the moment

Yeah no problem. They're hard to wrap your head around but once you understand them it makes sense. Ask away
Trust in Cathy bro. I bought ARKK today.
Pharmabro's never lie
Bought more today
Here's a DD for you: theyre merging with Barkbox. Look at every yoga pants wearing, starbucks sipping, organic dildoing, husky dog loving instagram obsessed millennial  and how they treat their dog (not kids because they're not having kids, they're buying dogs).

Should I continue?
Yes
Nothing lasts forever my friend
PLTR yes, this is a decent consolidation phase and the news flow for them has been exceedingly positive lately

GME no...it's up like fucking 35% in 2 days lol
What I’m saying the point of the government is to help support any and all businesses.

Remember when Donnie started a trade war with China then subsequently had to bail out farmers?  You saying he shouldn’t have done that either?

Operating a government on 500b or less isn’t feasible.  Have you looked at the budget lately?  Hell I think the military spends that alone.
It’s everyone’s fault bud
Just remember. BABA had a record sale few weeks ago on their version of Black Friday. 

Their revenue target for 2021 is $106 Billion, which is 49%+ from 2020. Come February earnings, it will be back up. Probably wont breach $300 until they resolve the situation with Xi but their core business is booming amidst this turmoil with the government.
Crash, it's almost guaranteed. Lenders are not happy and they've got what 9b ish debt? Not quite sure about the currency conversion right now.

I would go with ARKG then.
Agree on Twitter, disagree on Facebook. FB has behind the scenes Data Analytics & AI Software which is world class.
Shit man, I don’t think the pump even happened.    Straight out the gate on Monday it went down.

I mean, we’re talking Electric vehicle AND skateboard technology.  Together.  

The future is now.
Incredible, besides Cohen reshaping the company this Microsoft revenue sharing deal with GameStop is a lot bigger than you think, game stop having the market cap at 1.4billion is just a fraction of what it’s suppose to be. Twisting that knife into Melvin capital and BofA is so bitter sweet.

I like the longer term plays of PLTR - but the option premiums are too high - so I'd look at the stock.
Still cute
Up 1k for the day
BABA calls last chance boys. Will open 240 monday
I hear you
i don't think market realizes how low demand for fixes is right now. its more of an insider secret. still, the market does what it wants. at the close once again there is pretty strong buying. i have a hunch some vested interests are pinning it around 70 for their end of year bonuses
Current position, ~1k shares in SPCE, this baby will take off come Jan 4th
Right when I think I’m out, BABA pulls me back in 😤😤
We close in 5 mins buddy
I think it’s more about selling Funko Pops, Pokémon Cards, action figures, etc. The kind nerdy stuff that you would find in Hot Topic or the big kids section in Toys R’ Us (RIP). There’s no way their business plan involves selling digital copies of games. Even with exclusive DLC or whatever the fuck that wouldn’t be enough to resurrect GameStop. They’re just a meme at this point, and nerds are fickle as fuck.
Stop the count!

This is literally a thing. Worked 10/11 times. Seriously
Yup, Motley Shills came out with the lamest hit piece of all. Even they can no longer spout the usual shortie bullshit, too many of their readers have already awoken to the truth, so they basically write a neutral-leaning-slightly-bullish article, but then title it in a way that it sounds like buying the dip is a bad bet, hoping to sway title-only-readers into the bearish attitude.

BTW, $20 ended up being a massive limit buy price, a lot of longs piled in, the price briefly dipped below and then just strong bounce back into the $20.05-$20.15 territory.

This is actually good fucking news, because the $20 support from December 22, 2:30 PM held strong and didn't let the bears drill it any lower.

Lets see what last 5 minutes bring  


EDIT: solid ending of the day. Contrary to this sub's hate for red days, a modest red day like this is good, healthy and revealing. $20 is a strong support, much stronger than $20.6 that fell without much fight earlier today. That means we're wedged in between $20 and $22. That's a massive improvement in just 4 trading days.

Next week, expect total chaos and fireworks. Short tutes will be desperately clawing to minimize end of year losses, paperhands will keep the volatility high and longs will keep piling in at dips. Expect we test the $19.5 support, if that breaks, we might be in trouble, but also, if the bullrun stomps through the $22 wall, we can see another massive green day like this Tuesday. 

Fun ending of the year.
Wont they pump again when they start announcing partnerships?
Also if it goes past the final date, do you lose all your shares/money completely? Sorry for the questions just struggled to get someone that actually shares knowledge 😂

Here’s a documented upvote since you’re currently sitting at 69. Didn’t want to ruin the mood.
IV on these BABA calls are fucked
what if big pharm crushed up remdesivir and diluted it with water and called it a vaccine? 😂
RKT ticker is a setup for a P\D IMO. Bout as bad as NKLA.
You too bitch
It's only money man
Same here, pretty much across the board
Ty

All in calls
VIX pricing is always bullshit. Lots of space to play tricks. Tried to sell put spread at 400 and sat there unfilled for 2 hours. Then I raised price to 600 and it gets immediately filled. Why would this happen?
Calls on Arkham Asylum

The trades I made for it are all spread out and retarded so I don’t want to try to figure out how to screen shot every thing and make it look pretty. About a month and a half ago I yolod everything in pic calls, then reinvested those gains into more calls that were otm. I had 15 dollar strikes originally, the final product was 117 30 dollar strikes for January.

Lol he prob bought the bags I sold at 19
pence won’t do it
If you pussies stopped selling we would be green
What the heck thanks man!! Been trying to work it out for ages I thought you had to sell on thst date and it just depended what the price was on that date. 

What's the best trading app to do shorts? I'm on 212 ans can't work it out for the life of me.
yeah that makes sense. im thinking about a similar weight for my 401k
NVDA should buy Tidal instead of SQ imo. That way they can use their super machine learning to fix the recommendation algos and beat SPOT at their own game.

What’s carrying this EOD rally?
[deleted]
Well rode BABA Calls up for 20%, I don't have more conviction in BABA than this. Sold em before close.

Let's see how I feel about my paperhands Monday lol.
PLTR shares sell covered calls
It's up from yesterday's open as well, what are you smoking. Up 2% last week overall. Up 13% last month. Excellent performance all around. Would have made money on any AAPL calls other than weeklies, LOL
We all pump here to sell options dumbass
[deleted]
Ffs Idk what I expected. Happens every time I go all in on puts. Next time I want to do that I need to inverse myself but then it’ll probably finally dump
My ego just grew a full inch.
I always set limit orders. Who the fuck creates market orders other than boomers?
Any gains I make go right into more plays until 0. This is the way right ? I don’t think I have a cash out option
Pltr?
[removed]
APPL was pumping nicely at the start then it all went downhill and it literally stays flat when with the huge SPY green dildo like a minute ago bro
Put it all in USOI...24.55 % dividend rate now...it is @ $4 a share. Just live for now off of 2k for now ?
I see almost everything as red, bit confused honestly
Ok maybe AMZN isn’t the call EOD
Oof, portfolio looks pretty shite right now, but I picked up some cheapies today, hopefully we rally monday
Ur talking to the guy who sold his CRSR 30 calls 1 day into nov rally
Still holding 2 12/31 13c
You can’t maintain a yacht if you’re retarded ⛵️
Good, now that you've got some real money gtfo of robinhood.
Lol where have YOU been the last three months

Spent mystical stimmy on aapl 1/21/2022 185 call
Someone convince me to not buy 8k of GME shares
OOF
Get in on NVDA and Wayfair calls. Such dips don’t come often! 😎😎😎
Never pay for financial advise, never pay someone else to click buttons or research when you can do it yourself, but his videos that that were once private/pay for access are now on his account and floating around the web. There's A LOT of good information in them. Don't pay for his services tho.
BABA going up but my calls are going down. IV “crush?” They’re five months out
Oof
I agree. Might liquidate some shares for a few of those spreads!
Hold the loooiiinnee
Merry Christmas everyone 🎄
There goes another paycheck
Did you forget to charge during your shift behind Wendy’s again?
AI, they're currently dipping. But their stock will most likely double in the next year. And SPCE.
Tsla
I just hit the live button. I thought everyone has that button.
Not really. I sweat when I don’t go all in because I think “man if I moved that other $500k in, could’ve gained another $X.”

Gotta have conviction bro
I lost all of it on weeklies.
Merry Christmas MFs
How did you get out, first step...
Made back some of my BABA losses from the bottom, -3.7K more to go
Down $800? That's cute
come on palantir you fucking cocksucker
“Dude, my corporate overlords have like 15-20 pages of special interests they want alone.”

“Yeah fuck it.  Everyone throw your lists in together, we’ll just present all the pages together, and just all agree to vote on it together?  Yeah, good?  You good?”

“Sure but let’s give the people like 5 or 6 hundred bucks, and then we can just point the finger at each other and say that this was the best we can do”

“Sounds good, I’m going home for the holidays.  Merry Christmas, assholes.  I’ll call y’all from one of my vacation homes or some rich fuckers yacht”

As SPY rallies into close, my portfolio keeps getting more red. Wtf.
Puts on all the Vaccine Druggies.

Big Pharma lied. I'm SHOCKED.
BABA 220C 12/24 was a 10+ bagger
GME 20.21 eod
Smells like horse shit.

Most modern trading UI's have checkpoints. If you try to place a market order on e.g: ToS, e-trade or Interactive, if the market order you place is so far off the theoretical price (which is what this person is saying), the order gets rejected immediately.

Don't fall for this shit.
I think Im the only one who can lose money on SQ calls 2 times in a row
[deleted]
Just look at it upside down
Bought some GME shares in case we see some good action Monday.

Approved
Greedy fuck
Facts
R M G is Godly
BABA dip gone just like that
All major indexes green.  

Pretty much everything I own is bleeding.  

🤣
I already did in the past with zero success. The last time I bought SPY leaps, we were down -8% in the next 2 weeks and the last time I bought AAPL leaps, it was flat for the next 2 months and I got IV crashed.
Bought them ofc yesterday lmfao
im thinkin of gettin in but seeing all these bagholders sellin so quickly and sharply cause pooh and the gang are investigating makes me xtra cautious

Probably fomo'd and bought at the top.

Got in @ $255 got a long way to go for me GUH
i didnt realise plastic was going anywhere. lol

they are bouncing back and will adapt to be clean energy businesses
Ok? I do have an issue with it, the money disproportionately goes to larger companies because larger companies qualified for larger loans. Instead of taxing people and giving their money away to someone else, let people keep more of their money, which they can choose to spend wherever they want. That is allowing CONSUMERS to decide winners and losers, as opposed to letting the government decide winners and losers by choosing who gets how much bailout money.
why do ni and pltr look so similar lol
8 minutes to buy your FDs! I’m selling $AAPL calls and $TNA puts! Hot ‘n’ Ready!
bleeding
there's always a bull market somewhere
P&D or not, OP is making me $.
I've not found any place that takes tax deductions as legal tender
I got wrecked today
oof
That’s right. Long term baby.
who still holding GME calls?
This is the kind of weak ass pump with the sole purpose of trying to get us to hold heavy bags. Not buying it.
Inverse of course
Buy and hold baby, buy and hold
You can’t drive a lambo if you’re retarded 🥊
BABA 2022 leaps anyone?
Merry spacmas everyone

Merry Christmas and diversify
10 minute pump incoming, hold on!
Goddammit. Took a bath selling roku call spreads. FUUUCKK.
Where are all those GOP anti-libs today? Y’all blocked a $2,000 stimulus check an silently slink off the chat? 

Where’s all that big dick GOP energy now? 

Pass the fucking stimulus you assholes!

This. Jack has 🧻 hands, took profits and is likely doing coke and hookers on his new yacht. Happens daily. I would have done the same thing.
Jesus major volume on BABA 300C 1/21/22 - smart money knows v shaped is inevitable
Even that would more than double my net worth
Nice! Looking to up my gambling game, this sounds great
Is that Asian Alec Baldwin on the left?!
Cathie and Buffet don't dump their entire holdings the day after though ;P
Good call, they’re on discount right now

Bruh it’s cool off, over sold rn
Totally agreed.  Holding $20 when the last time it had a run up it didn't hold $17ish.

Sentiment on the ticker has gone up, plenty of catalysts upcoming, and people are still FOMOing in and out.

What anyone does with their money is up to them, but I'm about them shares and long calls.
last 10 min pump lets go
What ever happened to the brexit deal? Thought that was today...?

I'm down 20% on 3/19 25c. Everyone who bought march calls last week is bleeding
Was thinking of buying a baba put but realized that time was last week latest. Bought 2/19 210c. Worse case scenario it crashes into a Ma Bell situation but unlikely.
seems like a good hedge against a long american recovery
This is the way
so, drill then flat to close. nice little xmas fuck you
dont like seeing red lol
I put a limit order in for 2 cents over what I paid, just hoping it dips a tiny bit and I can scalp a couple hundos

Short squeeze may happen, but trying to pick the exact time it will happen is pretty fucking hopeful.  You need to assess your conviction levels on a post like that.
Yep. 1.5 month long bull flag with declining volume. It’s gonna wreck 2021. I wouldn’t short it with your money.
Probably vipshop. I don't know much about this one at all tbh- but it could be a real sleeper. Will have to look into this one.

Epic big chungus rally coming next week?
12:58
APPL is still down if you considered yesterday. And honestly if I hadn’t got out my contracts would have lost 15% of its value easily. But it’s holding decently well, so I might re-enter
Damn, that makes me sad
You couldn’t even name Chrysler or Ford. 

You’re all suggesting small businesses do not receive any help at all (see PPP).

Anecdotally I know a lot of small businesses that took advantage of it, and that’s fine.  I’m not the one who has an issue with that.
Don’t gamble bro. Make your own decision and be confident in it.

Got a shit ton on KGC calls
Somebody already posted similar story here about buying TLRY and lost around $30K right after sending an order simply because of the wide spread. 

He called his broker, TDA, and they made a deal with MMs to lower average entry price cutting his losses to around $1K. 

If the guy in the post is not using RH, maybe he could try to talk to customer service of his broker...

Hi yes thanks for telling us something we already know.  In case you haven’t figured it out yet, most people on this sub, and in general, don’t want to wait 20+ years to cash in on some gains.

Hmm (temples fingers) I’m retarded

What is a ticker\\gang you learned not to fuck around with in 2020?

I'll go first: TNKR.
No I bought the exact middle price. The Vega on it is $38 which Is wild. Probably should have made note of that first.
But I thought this whole sub was just pump n dump🤔
I hate this market so fucking much. It's literally designed to steal my money no matter what I do.
well.. they're from Ohio
There's a webull python module someone wrote on GitHub, super useful, and you can use finnhub for real time ticker prices
Pump you lousy bitch
i've been hovering pretty much around -0.5% on the day with one spike down at open and one huge spike up immediately after before settling at this boring level. i guess arbitrarily a win will be closing green, a lose will be closing lower than -1.0%
CLOSE THE DOOR, STOP THE COUNT, TURN THE FUCKIN SHIT OFF

I agree that SFIX is trash. What's less clear is when the market will realize. COVID is great for SFIX, since fashion-crazed folks can't go shopping physically. On the other hand, all you need for Zoom is a decent top, no pants or shoes or accessories. 

Why can't SFIX stay at this level until in-person shopping picks up again?

why'd you buy into baba? Or buy AMD weeklies, you'd be better off buying amd 2022 calls
BABA rocketing to 230 end of day
That is literally what I said. The government shouldn’t pick winners and losers. The consumer should via purchases. As far as tax credits, like I said previously, the tax rates are to fund a budget of 1.5T+ per year. I would want the government operating on 500b or less. And yeah, you can remove all tax incentives after cutting the amount of tax you need to collect into a third of what it currently is. Why would the government need to maintain the same tax revenue if I’m proposing they do absolutely nothing to interfere in the market? They obviously wouldn’t.
That's what the dude who did triangles. He said it will gonna take off this week

Lol do it
Probably quite low. Cathie said they'll expect something like 20+% from the next year.
You guys loading up on anything shares wise before the weekend?
I need a Christmas miracle
Buy the dip now before the stimmy passes. Who gives a fuck about your tiny ass gains.
If this happens we all buying x at ipo.  Yolo on x calls

funny that some of y'all are freakin out about GME being down 2.5% after being up >33% on the week but in reality i'm super bullish seeing it hold $20, very excited to see whats in store for next week.

Buy the dip. Just reenter at 36.30 x 1200 shares.

I think I observed this in RKT and WY today. Gonna grab a couple of shares and see what happens.

Although, WY is pretty close to it's 52 week high, and in the case of RKT, I might have gotten "Golden Cross" mixed up with "Death Cross". Welp, here goes nothing!
Buying the dip on this bitch
Np.a to the moon
Ban this retard
I mean it was probably not right, but you never know with this things
Sadly a lot of people at the time were pessimistic and led to me selling early, congrats to everyone who made big bucks
I hope so! More money to spend on stocks haha.

fake news yay.
People follow him for sure and it's not his fault that he has followers but also in his last post, he wouldn't show his holding in the company to show that he bought just before market close yesterday, and he dumped it today at the high. To me, it's obvious that he hyped it on WSB to get people to buy it, and sold off the momentum he created. You can actually see the volume change from when he posted yesterday, to yesterday's afterhours, today's pre-market, and today's 10% drop.
Announcing a new entrant to NASDAQ breaks a rule?

Lmao what, AAPL is green on a red day.

You can’t quit, you still have $330 to lose

Why are you comparing two companies that aren't comparable?
Yeah I mean this is not profit taking. If you want to take profits what you are describing is perfect
Can this guy read a balance sheet? They’re hoarding cash, repaying notes due March 2021 and extending debt issued until 2023. They’ve cut net losses nearly in half and cash flow is up froM last year. GME is restructuring and the stock price is reflecting that.
NIO probably gonna gap up before NIO day...hopefully

PLTR DD recap (Serious) for those who missed it! (Gay mods removed first post...)

Hi guys first off I'll keep it fast and simple cause some are retards some autistic. 

Since Cramer recognizes WSB, we have as much to say as Credit Gay and Shitron. WSB analyst ANAL KING price target for PLTR 42$+ for 2021. This is not financial advice, do your own DD. This is for autism purposes only. Invest at your own risk.

This is a former DD post from u/Felsommer so all credit to him! :

https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/keu3ca/pltr_will_moon_soon_i_got_proof/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

Next the 1H must watch video on PLTR :

https://youtu.be/_0i9XU3MA7s

And a last one Alex Karp saying PLTR will be the most important software company in the world :

https://youtu.be/6loNXj3LSaw

Now I could add way more, like all the clients they already have etc...etc... so also do some research!

TLDR - All in PLTR 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Buy shares if you're serious.
replace reindeer at top with bulls, bears on the bottom. otherwise gj!
Pretty sure its singular for stocking. Where Santa touches you

Hit baba calls, up 100 already, still getting into gme like rn
Exactly,  we are on the same page.
 If you like BABA I think you have to do it with deep in the money calls right here.. .i would like another day to assess...

You, like the congress people who represent you, can easily name Ford Chrysler and GM, but what about the thousands of business you can’t name, that aren’t big enough for congress people to care about because they don’t donate millions to their campaigns. Where do their tax dollars go? To bailout a company, while their own company fails? It’s insanity. Nobody is deserving of a bailout. Especially not big business.

It’s kind of true but don’t say that :/ there are smart black investors too, I wish as a people they become more educated and level up in love also.
But that is not what you said.

The problem here is you’re basing an argument based on absence of facts.

Regardless, if you really think they shouldn’t interfere in any business then you’re asserting they should remove all tax credits and small business incentives.  Let the consumers decide right?

You can’t have it both ways.

If you want FCEL, I'd sell the $12p 1/15 and collect premium. If you get assigned, cost basis is \~10.31. If not, you pocket a very nice premium on a high IV stock.

BABA dip is free money guys. It basically like the FB dip during the spring, expect a V shaped recovery.

What dip do I buy
to short more and drive the price down, because nobody actually wants to hold GME long term.
True, but it's currently 100% of my portfolio, so I'm thinking I need a bit of diversification.
That's nothing on JKS or DQ over the last few days.
I’ve been in the SPAC game for awhile. Haven’t seen a price movement like what’s going on with $STIC for awhile. Even promising spacs like $BFT don’t budge this much with 100M volume. $STIC is trading at ~4M volume and going absolutely wild

Gotcha. My calls are far out so no biggie but just wondering. Thanks man

So what we betting 700 TSLA  before 1/1??
Imagine being cash gang this week and not yoloing into SPAC’s.
They need to cover today because it'll be the 13th day that GME is on the threshold list. 

Clearing houses might force them to cover their positions for failing to borrow. Combined with a random positive headline, this could very well lead to a mini short squeeze come Monday, similar to what we saw in October. 

In fact, it might be conducive to buy weekly calls for once.
Ok I was told this group would help for 10% of any profit I make. Guess I should call my bank.

You will stop hearing about it shortly after it stabilizes at $50

S&p is a big hotel. The parking is in the basement. Let’s say it has 100 floors. We are probably on floor 94 right now and need to get to floor 70. Obviously not going to the garage because we don’t need to leave the hotel, but need to go back to 70 because they need to do construction on the upper floors so we can keep going higher. What I’m trying to say is, well, we need a correction.

Today was the perfect day for shorts to attack GME but it is only down like 2%.  I know they didn’t give up with that short position. What is their next move?
The app is actually already under review for both app stores. Not sure if they have anyone reviewing during the holidays so I'm not sure the exact timeline on when the app will be here, but I'm shooting for next week.

It’s still on, waiting for a clear break
With 300k you could have made the same gains in an index fund without the stress if you invested in March or April.
I’m saying they should have bailed nobody out. By bailing them out they are picking winners. If they do nothing, the consumers pick who survives via purchases. The market naturally chooses winners and losers, we don’t need the government interfering in that.
You seen the airbb dude ?
nope owning RKT is worse
Any interesting plays to buy?
BABA calls are the obvious choice, which is why I’m scared of them 😂

Made so much money off buying calls when JD dips then shoots up immediately
And I was worried about my 2022 Leaps. At least I'm not you
Let GME die already 😩
Right? Jesus christ I get that it's a casino, but how can you lose with the odds so fucking heavily in your favor? It's amazing.
Hmm not a bad idea, just keep the train going
Damn retards really buy Jordan’s for 8x the retail price. Been in the wrong business my whole life apparently

Should I sell EOD or eat the holidays and see what happens next week?
Do I get into RMG now or nah?
How can I be happy if I can't watch the lines move.
It's a 2021 rotation trade into commodities. People put $ in what they value. 2010-2020 saw people placed money in digital companies, including retarded companies like Facebook and Twitter. This next supercycle will be placing value into real stuff that can be used to build out our future. Will people be behind on this trend? Yep. But not steelgang.

You could do that, or my preference is to roll to a longer dated call at a higher strike. So farther out than 7/16

I made some mostly due to stic. Most stocks seem to be down today. Mostly holding GME and ARK funds
Woof BABA, what a day. Sold my puts early at 100% profit, but if I'd held on to midday, my contacts clocked in at over 500% profit at some points. No matter, profit is profit!
So im retarded. How do i save this to look at it weekly on my phone?

Thanks I assume I may have violated a rule? Please advise.
Again, the plausible sounding applications do not sound profitable because of the small scope of applicability. If you can give a motivated explanation of how neuralink could possibly find profitable application within the next decade I would be happy to hear it. Maybe there's something deeper cooking behind the scenes but based on what has been made public so far, it is no more advanced than standard deep brain stimulation tech plus some very simple machine learning. It will already take a lot of work to restore motor function to paralyzed patients, and I don't see this as having much potential for profit in light of the very small scope of applicability (paralyzation isn't exactly a "growth" sector).

But again, prove me wrong if you have something insightful to say.
DKNG plz

oh shiet BABA on sale
Attention r/all newcomers:

The huge %gain is totally fake. Probably had a 50k account, made \~100%+ off buying calls on any tech stock, then withdrew 50k leaving 6k.

The chart will mess up and show massively inflated gain%, and it is especially common to see this happen on 1 month or 3 month timeframes.

Still a gain, but not anywhere near 1400%. It's yet another fake "i started with nothing and made 5-6 figs" post that now seems to pop up every hour as more autists figure out how to do it.

Do your part of keeping the sub not-total-garbage by reporting trash gain posts showing 1 month RH lines with no positions / trade history.

&#x200B;

Like really, he's showing he went from 6k to 100k i na 1 month time frame pic. No one is asking for a pic of the MASSIVE play he would have needed to make, to represent the one line up in his chart? That would have been one fat play. He would have posted that if it actually happened, not this chart image.
Trump must have called Loeffler and Perdue and said he'll sign the bill
Pretty much all my stocks are red today, yay
Weak hands not welcome
I mean, what would you consider success? Maybe he doesn’t bring GME to a 40bn market cap, but he could at least double it just by refocusing their business. Once we start seeing deals being made (I’m thinking something similar to Xbox Gamepass) we’ll have a better idea of his plans. But he is ambitious for sure, you have to respect it.
[deleted]
Yes I understand. IV isn’t bad but no volume on my strike. Hoping it picks up on Monday.
Coz I bought calls. Sorry

Last time ppl bought the dip on BABA it kept drilling. its down $100 in a couple of months
How low are you on the CNBC totem pole if you are working today while Cramer is off?
Good I can sleep in my Porsche instead of my wife’s boyfriends couch. He cooks in the kitchen like the dude from baby boy. F$@% him. His florentine eggs is pretty good though.
BABA
Chinese government just wants to put on a show. BABA is clearly far and away the largest and most pervasive company in China. Alipay is weaved into the fabric of everyday life. NO ONE uses cash. Everyone pays with Alipay. 

Chinese government knows they can’t take down BABA but they can’t lose face either. Jack Ma knows this, which is why he is so deferential in public and says the government did the right thing. This will be no more than a slap to the wrist. They might try to foster the growth of smaller competitors but BABA is too big to fail now.

There is a cultural nuance here that is literally missed by the entire Western world.
Who else is holding everything bags right now
Bought baba calls at 212 but IV was so fucked that I’m still down lol
Anyone buying FB calls? 🤔
Damn that's a good return on $4 worth of calls.
what do you think of the other competitors? one of them was up 10% today due to baba news
I bought on March 16th, I couldn't care less, long future ahead 🚀🚀🚀🚀
This is the way
I did
Took a gamble and bought NKLA puts yesterday even though they already lost 10%. Feel like unless something drastic happens they only got one way to go
you are a hero to the people , fellow autist

You got me.

Nice man. Weeklies is why trying to trade based on the daily thread sentiment is so fucked up. I keep reading people panicking at the slightest drop, but I check my calls that are months and months and months out and they seem relatively okay.
Mattresses must be a hot commodity for Christmas
KG!
Based on if trumps says it’s a no go or not
Same
amzn is trash
It's not trash. The stock is OTC right now and folks over at r/pennystocks are getting ridiculous returns right now with ALPP announcing it's being uplisted. It's possible that if you get in early enough you'd see a return while the stocks still hot (it wasn't expected to break $1 until 2021 but it's evident that even it's 3.5 expectation in 2 years is going to break soon).

ALPP isn't just a pump and dump. The company looks to be very legit and a decent long-term hold, we're just getting to the results of that "long-term" quicker
This is the bee’s knee’s. Awesome job!
For sure, Santa delivers presents to kids everywhere.

BABA black sheep have you any tendies?
USA: congress can’t agree on shit and shutdown looks likely and same goes for stimulus

China: clamping down on big tech, I think it’s part of a bigger picture so China can look like it gives a shit about global rules/laws but the impact isn’t great

Europe: Brexit should be good news for the market, but having the world’s largest economies fucking around is going to put weight this

Oh and many equities  are overpriced as well and there is a massive imbalance with far too many call options outstanding versus the puts in the market so this helps drag shit down as market makers aren’t worried about fucking themselves on put obligations.
F my life been staring at this shit for a freaking month

added another 500 GME shares at 19.97 and sold 24c for 1/15 to bring it down closer to 18.5, won't complain if i lose them.  Cohen's $16.02 Dec-18 buy as my guide
Santa is real because BABA was selling for $211 today , that is the best Christmas present ever.
This business of flipping devices for $100 each... If they're constantly buying and selling them at each of their 4000 locations, and delivering them within an hour or so... wow. Would take some tech investment to keep the inventory distributed well, I think, but much better than waiting for a particular item to ship across the country.

I would say though that AMZN is in a lot more countries than GME is. But if Ryan Cohen gets this up and running, and then starts expanding to other countries with a system all in place... astronomical growth prospects from there.
Which dip to buy?? 🤔 GME,RIOT PACB already have FCEL
Yes to 20
Nothing to degen on today unless I want to bet on middle eastern soccer. Today is a withdrawal symptom kinda day. Might watch uncut gems today to get in the spirit
We the consumer should decide who fails, with our purchases. If a company cannot survive off of the consumers purchases, it should not exist. 

What you are proposing is that the government picks winners and losers, as opposed to the market picking winners and losers. What you are saying is inherently unfair to smaller business/small people, because the small guy isn't in the room drafting bailout legislation, but big business is. Big business and big government work hand in hand to consolidate each others winnings.
Having an order in below bid and not getting a fill is probably the most frustrating experience known to man

FUBO is bending me over. Just doubled up  to average down.
Don’t get me wrong, I understand where you’re coming from. But don’t think that thinking the stock will be 40% lower 2 years from now isn’t just as speculative as thinking it’ll be $200/ share. For me, doesn’t really matter what happens. Own shares with a 300% gain, traded away my call options with a huge gain so not much can happen where QS would be a loss.
BABA shareholders: I’m never gonna financially recover from this.
Fortunately, I don't take ethics lessons from WSB accounts.

Again, just read or re-read the DD and the comment for the full disclosures.

Earnest readers will understand that this is a speculative play by its very nature and they are free to buy, sell or hold the security as they see fit.

I learned that Congress tried to sneak in a clause which would nullify the insurrection act of 1807 in the 6k page long “COVID relief” bill
The BABA bears are loading up on $200p while the BABA bulls are loading up some $250c. Whatever happens next week, there will be both loss and gain porn. THERE WILL BE PORN 𓂸 🍆💦
Congrats on robbing that guy and cracking his RH password
classic spy fuckery
NVTA shares
Merry christmas lolol

Hope BABA recovers. just bought far OTM leaps for July 22
$SQ purchases Tidal would be high level retarded - perfect for Jack
Cyrx?
At least they are delicious!
uneventful day

wish I had more cash to buy right now
Fggt
Why?
lol dumbass
Canoo is gonna be a hit long
Then why are you confusing them?
I’m boring. I don’t do weeklies. I don’t yolo. I don’t panic sell. I don’t do puts. I only fuck with companies that make sense to me.
Less than 11 years. After that all our dogs will be dead. 😭
Do they have options available or just shares?
I had 20k 2 weeks ago now I have 5k fuck you guys
Same
I’m almost there...
Anyone buying the tdoc dip?
I have 7/16/21 ICLN 28c. When it hits 28, should I roll it up to a 7/16/21 30c? Take home some of the profits?
A hostile takeover. A sexy hostile takeover.

If you bought NKLA in the last month or if you didn't sell in the last month, you absolutely deserve that L. Peak retardation
I’d still clap

if i could have anything for xmas
Great time to come onboard the tendie train.
Smart man
Yeah my puts r eating shit rn
I’m thinking of 20k on G H I V 15c... should I do that or shares?
Santa Claus is not real. This is the lesson we can all take from this week.
Lol good luck
[deleted]
Buying the BABA dip ofc. But I also think JD is a strong buy rn since they're a substitute for BABA in terms of ecommerce in China.
Apple 134 close would be amazing
FCEL and FUBO
At h’what time CST does the market close at today?
Uhhhhh CRSR doesn’t have a bottom 🤧
You better ask Santa for more margin.
Jan 15 but yeah should’ve gone further out
Already in had leaps
That are down 40 percent rn
She still fine

You losing your loss porn is too meta for me.

I'm in this post and I don't like it.
Um um um short squeeze at 12:55? 😭💎🙌
Who’s in VALE? Really want to dump my March calls
so when is steel week? next week?
That pig-tailed BITCH
Same
146,000 shares were bought back by short sellers this morning between 9:30 and 10am.

That's a drop in the bucket, multiple millions of shares are still sold short, it hasn't happened, when the squeeze comes its going to be slow.
bought more pltr and gme yesterday, i can only afford to eat cup noodles this Christmas
for sure, ambitious too.  it's just crazy how many folks actually have success following up their initial attempt.  the pool shrinks considerably the number of people who can do it twice, three times, more
This shouldn’t be the last of the BABA bad news so I guess I’ll wait
"short term gains"
can you read? weeklies or stfu

AAPL Calls EOD?
Is that Cathie Wood buying BABA?
Meh, do people even use Coudera anymore? OPs hyping makes it sound like a new undiscovered company but the data science industry has already moved on from using it.

LOL, merry christmas
I heard laughing in cnbc background
What do you think of 670c tsla 12/31
You trolling me rn? Or this actually a thing
Broke ass
Congrats and fuck you.
Crsr has dipped 15% from its week high in two days. Yeah very normal behavior. Talk about fomo before earnings.
and out 221, thanks for heads up looking for more downside now
it's probably because you're betting against the trend

the trend is why buy the dip works

learn to identify the trend
BABA ends the day at $230 and my leap will be ITM
A company valued at 50B got a contract for 9 million in revenues?

Seriously? That's newsworthy?
i sold 10 1 dte 25c covered calls yesterday for .75 cents

I couldnt believe what dummy would buy that
GME >>> BABA
Goes red in one day and you think it's RIP? Where is your foresight
Apparently China cares about monopolies? I had no idea, I thought that was kind of the whole thing over there.

Why the fuck are you buying weeklies on ark
im never gonna bet aginst tsla again...

i hope it crashes to the ground next week tho

Wiyh nothing to show for it

Oh yeah? What’d you pick up?
Bought earlier and I'm up 20% lmfao
it will moon on "baba fined 10 million" lol
Remind me! 1 hour
Salmonella same
😂
Eod Monday for capital gain/loss totals?
In his other threads he says MT has good management, is the largest steel supplier in the world, and is vertically integrated. Vertical integration = better able to keep costs down/better margins in an environment when the global supply chain is fuked.
Everyone just go buy 10 shares of GME now!
Yeah I as buying that dip too. This play just has so much going for it right now with the new administration, any bills coming up, etc. I've got almost 10k riding on this.
Lmao 🤣😆

I had a dream last night that BB leaps we’re a multi bagger. Not sure if I am a prophet or I just need to take a break from trading.
cant wait for that fucking cocksucker to disappear
Meaning? Higher IV/risk?
BABA with the classic dead cat bounce. RIP
It's pretty easy to see where the profits are for rocket reuse. Success in one venture doesn't guarantee success in another. If you can explain how the neuralink will actually generate revenue without overstating the capabilities of the technology, I'll happily concede the point but I'm guessing you can't give a careful argument. As it stands, the demonstrated capabilities of neuralink are no more complex than ALREADY EXISTING TECHNOLOGY which is not particularly profitable because of the small scope of applicability.
Chill out man it’s up almost 30% this week
Won’t be a penny stock soon
I bought gme 25 12/31 today... I feel I belong here no matter what happens with it
Pink Floyd disagrees
This is the way.
That’s why they called it PAC12 after dark lmao
I have GME CSPs @20 on 12/31 and cover calls @25 on 12/31. I wonder which one will hit.
Don’t get me wrong. Pump and dump definitely happening, but its a long weekend, they just announced an incredible vaccine management staff, and they’re in phase 3 of their trials with half of their goal done. Definitely going to be a good long term
I just bought ARKK @133.42 and am hoping it takes back off Monday and this is just a shitty Christmas
Handle forming on CRSR daily

Bft pump in 3...2....1.....
Believe they have some catalysts coming in the new year. NIO will be fine
Made me check....
And you think it went up 40% in 2 days organically? That's what a short squeeze looks like. Yesterday was it.

The short interest is probably stable from week to week because shorts are going to re enter here.
Stop being a Bear and join a winning team bro. Bull 4 Life

I posted some lost poss but that shit disappeared - dunno what happen
Matter of fact it’s all dark
Lost a bunch of money today. Merry Christmas everyone.

Patience
I really wanna dump my VALE $19c 3/19😐
you know we talk that STIC talk, that STIC talk 🤤🤤

and I’m gonna need me more STIC talk, that STIC talk 🤑😤
Yeah not enough red yet
That place is about to turn into a riot
You want free money???? Buy the BABA dip bound for fucking Pluto 🚀
We are getting some institutional buys on CRSR at 12.50pm ET. Thank me later.
ok you guys. 

what did we learn this week?

Who are the retards that truly thought AAPL was gonna kill TSLA and bought puts? I wanna shake their hand lol
I’d bet my left nut on this
Yup. This is your entry point. Under 19 as I type this.
He wanted to lie to them so those dumbasses pump us too. You're good man.
Yes
>weeklies 

Dude. 69% is insane for a year. We have to be so careful to avoid the YOLO bets on here because we all know there are huge YOLO losses too. I'm in the same boat as you, similar gain. My best trade this year was QS @ $48.99. Not selling those till the fat lady sings.
What makes you say that
Buy the BABA dip? The investigation might well only result in a slap on the wrist...
Absolutely SMACKED today, ooops
This guy said he would hold much longer, but he sold today near the top. 
Clearly pump and dump. Mods get it right, don’t now why they unbanned him. 
This is clearly illegal and could get us banned
*Merry
Second time I’ve seen this verbatim
you called it perfectly.  also a hit piece against GME came out earlier.  called it.  💎 🙌
More like it’ll be trading at $25.
I got a head start and bought a bunch of shit before the dip 🤡
To be clear, im not leaving. I took the opertunity to buy more calls
So we are picking who gets to fail?

They also bailed out Ford...
If you have an IBKR account you can options trade in the UK (I’m from the UK and have an account)
What consoles? They’re way backlogged. Unless you mean the ones being scalped on eBay.
PUMP ITTTTT

Yeah I’m hoping for that. Get a nice scalp
Holy fuck spy is mooning get in now or miss out on the biggest opportunity of your life
Lately they’ve just been mining a hole to bury my calls in

Thinking about buying more airline shares. There is a good chance airlines will recover in 2021. Should I buy now or wait?
yes
Shit is flatter than Anne Hathaway's ass
Meanwhile over at TSLA
Yeah this little pullback today was necessary.  The dip got bought up really quick.  Holdingnin anticipation of a green monday.
You know, in fairness, BABAs choose 1 of 2 policy is pretty shady and monopolistic
[deleted]
Thank you Bruv. I’m holding for a couple more months
Right, so next time ask this in the daily discussion and not as a separate thread here or go to r/investingforbeginners and learn to read the room a bit better.
dude if you didnt buy them at open you already mistimed it
Haha you’re poor
what if you told us about this before it went up 20%? wouldve been better for all of us lol.
Can someone inform me why so many stocks are shitting the bed rn? I mean I’m 💎🙌🏾but I’m still curious
IV fuk bro
Both legs of my BABA call spread are up lol option magic
Mama Cathie pls bless us
GME all in, you will be millionaire in no time
jesus big pump
You guys dick ride him so hard that you buy whatever he says at any price and it pumps the stock. He's taking your money.
It’s so obvious that door dash is manipulated so fukin much. I mean all the market gets rekt and this fuker stays up 😡😡
I second that
Great work, had a look at the code and put in a pull request for a small typo, still works fine before changing and after
Imagine buying GME 22c 12/31
tis really amazing that the key to financial freedom lies now in the correct sequence of buttons pressed on one's smartphone. 

Press the right button, you're up in the clouds. Press the wrong button... you start over.
Yeah but they can also lose you everything if you dont play it correctly or the stock doesnt go up before your options expire worthless. Pltr is a stock that is a long term play. Think microsoft in 1986 or amazon in 1998
lol my BABA leaps were worth more at $212 than they are at $221 now  
  
Fuck off, IV
Looks like Xi sold his puts.
Ya almost 3 percent ass fuck
bahahah! the first "do all the work for me" post
sell my LAZR 1/15 30ps? I have a feeling it's going to run on Monday
That much is clear
This will probably be brought up in February, but what is your next option target after the Jan/Feb rally?
This retard bought at the top, won't share his positions and if you check his history its all OPEN spam. Ban this dipshit already

I honestly believe that people on WSB dismiss how BIG the used consumer electronics market is. It's because as I mentioned in Pt1, I don't think many of us can relate. 

The profit margin on these honestly puts the profit margin on new consoles to shame. 

'Gaming eBay' is an understatement. I ship hundreds of items on eBay alone everyday. I am very familiar with the drawbacks that they just can't overcome due to the core structure of it. It is going to be a hybrid, delivering what eBay wishes it could, at the speed faster than Amazon, customer service better than Amazon.

It is true that the console makers want digital. However, at least this console cycle, the concensus is people are buying more disc consoles. Digital is the way of the future but as laid out in Pt 1 of my DD, Gamestop will grow by keeping to the old model alone (albeit I project the growth will be 'little', in the low double digit). However, with consumer electronics they can scale.

Who else is in every neighborhood like GME is and who else can fill the gap in the used consumer electronics market like this? Nobody comes close.

People are upgrading their phones, GoPros, Drones... etc every year or two. If they can just hit the sweet spot and not get too greedy with the value they give for trade-ins, they can create a revolving door for a huge base. Especially with the way they give more in store credit.

Even with "not getting too greedy", the profit can easily be greater than the profit from selling NEW consoles. They can of course, start with the smallest margin to attract as many people as possible, and establish the reputation/consumer behavior (want to upgrade phone? forget craigslist/eBay/kijiji, just go to Gamestop/PowerUP)... etc etc from that point they can experiment with pricing. The "hustle" every trade-in model they used to employ is very short term based, and not sustainable, but moving forward they can and will change.

Cohen really knows how to attract more bees with honey.

Used consumer electronics is VERY liquid. You may be amazed if you ever get into it. 
Once they unlock this beast, they will literally start scaling as if 5 consoles are being released every year. They're already starting.
All of you who bought BABA, serves you right for betting against America. 

Unless you're actually from China, then that's fine, but not if you live in the US.
Jack MA I averaged down show me those brass balls u have let’s go
Buy the damn BABA dip 🚨 🚨 🚨
You probably did buy them at a dip though... i wouldn't worry long-term... i think in 12 months it's higher than right now for sure
[deleted]
They just diluted shares what, 2 weeks ago? It traded in the $7-10 range until this week. $14 is the top imo until more positive news.
BABA will close at least 230
GME shares if you want to live
It’s literally up 26% for the week what more do you people want

I'm waiting to cash out some gains in 2021.. taxes blow and i already made bank this year..

when i lived in chicago i had to dvr all my west coast sports (lakers, dodgers, kings, sc football) and watch that shit the next day. so lame. west coast is the best coast - big e smalls (i think)
We OWN GME how did we let this happen??
That’s reasonable
Holy fuck it’s looking bleak across everything today. Fuck U Santa
BABA ripping but my 250c FD is flat. I’m. I’m not worried though.
The economy is. But if the Chinese government doesn't like you, you're fucked.
Same
The guy that made Chewy.com is increasing his stake in GME and it’s looking like GME is going to follow his vision. He has big ideas for the future including esports and moving to online gaming. The hope for WSB autists is that he is initiating a hostile takeover and forcing GME into the 2020s.
Pls fly BABA
i always had CHWY in the BECKY portfolio man youve been missing out
No stimmy means lil timmy has no money for GME games
why would China face repercussions for a pathogen from the wild? this pandemic type shit happens every so often, it's spread was impossible to contain in the era of globalization + international plane travel. 

if you think otherwise, you've limited sensibility
I think that 500k share purchase and the ensuing coverage on reddit and twitter had a lot to do with it. I do of course take ownership of that purchase.
What a totally shit day. Can the holidays be fucking over already.
Can you guys please stop doing stupid shit in your Robin Hood Accounts
Amazon is so gsy
Thank you for this DD. Very strong and glad to see some good shit mixed in. Gave me the courage to buy my first contract after lurking forever.

If it makes you feel better, I lost about double that
[deleted]
And the cycle will begin anew.
If it breaks 215 there is no support until 200. That’s about a 25%-30% drop on leaps. It’s worth waiting to see what happens monday before hopping in.
Pinning SPY at 368 today? Lame. Idc which direction, just go fast
Yeah, seems like a solid play. I’m hoping for it to pop and hit 20$ sometime by the jan 20, but who knows.
STOP THE COUNT!
Thank you!
Been there.  Old company was based in orange county Ca and our annual meetings were at Balboa Bay Yacht club
Rip. Sorry for your puts
Really didn't expect that power hour BABA pump.

Wouldn't trust it with free money though.
Holy shit that TSLA green dildo just now
[deleted]
It’s down 55 cents....
dat baba pump all cathie
Very bullish on this play. I've got February 30c and May 30c. Hoping we get a BLNK-like run up to 50 in record time. That would give me some serious tendies. IV on these are all low and the premiums are low too. Great time to buy in before anybody really discovers this stock.
Lmao, AMZN will never be at $3000 again in your lifetime.
Gotta respect a guy that goes all in
If enough people used this wouldn’t it make massive dumps happen more often?
Amen.
Nah another short week. All plays should be made for January or don't play at all.
Don’t they know they’ve been on the 13 day list?
Hmm there is not going to be a squeeze but if I pretend like there is can I get some upvotes

I don’t get how it’s possible. How is it possible that everything I buy puts in fucking moons? It makes no sense. It every fucking time to. Doesn’t matter what the fucking stock is. I’m not even gonna say what I got puts in now.

Merry Christmas bulls and bears. Have a great weekend!
All of them bitch ( ꈍᴗꈍ)
I broke my own rule and listened to one of the retardd here and bought RIOT calls two days ago. Never buy what you don't know 🤦‍♂️
Sad Baba 🥺
thank you!
Hope they bring someone useful in
Who else is left holding the ARKK bags 😭
Had a buy orde at 20, but fomo'd 400 at 20.3. Rip ez 120 extra dollar. A lot for newbie like me

The government should have let GM fail, like they let the shareholders fail. Why should GM the company be bailed out for its incompetence? Who loses? The consumers still need cars, they will buy from Ford, and other companies instead, GMs assets would be auctioned off, and the workers would seek out new opportunities at Ford, or other car companies, or maybe in a different industry.

They shouldn’t have passed the cares act either, the government had no right to shut down business for “14 days,” so I mean you’re saying they had to give people money cause they fucked them over by closing down? I mean yeah I guess but my idea would be not to close down in the first place, and if you keep giving money to the states you’re incentivizing more lock downs.
Puts.  Lowest price on the puts in like a fucking hour. Motherfuckers.
first, you need to cover yourself in oil.
At least Intel is green lol

NVDA has been so garbage last 3 months. What's up with it?
I meant noob as new to this.
How did you know there was going to be a merger? Where did you find out about this?
So I guess BB isn't popping off past 7.50 afterall
Im holding july 25/30call spreads. Shit was like $100.  Super cheap and i think pretty likely to hit considering this holiday season has been all online
Employees and the CEO will be allowed to sell shares on the 31st. They are prevented from selling due to SEC ipo rules.
Nah my shit expires 22nd of January. Ik i shouldn’t be worried but seeing me down so much makes it tough lol
great DIP!!!
LOADED UP!! 🚀
I FUCKING HATE AMAZIN AND NIO SO FUCKING MUCH
It will fill your quantity at market price unless you place a limit order in which case the order will not be filled until the price comes back down to your limit, or until the time limit for the order expires.
I’m buying the CYRX dip. Im feeling it.

I just went to one of the wealthiest areas and now i feel poor😕 Everyone’s got a huracan, g wagon, Bentley, or Porsche

Look I'm not gonna call you retarded or anything but the short interest has been over 100% of float literally this whole time
Rip GME boys
Ah, I hadn't seen that statement yet. A little over a week ago they said they weren't. Apparently the backlash from their earlier statement probably forced this one.

Also the class action lawsuit that is starting to be filed probably had some impact on their transparency.
Why would you buy puts???? Do not listen to OP unless you wanna burn even more money.  This thing just got smoked 15% in one day after already bleeding out for the past couple months.  You really think buying puts while the stock is now at $216 is going to help you out?? Have fun losing more money as BABA rebounds over the next few months.
Dude you are spamming this so transparently hard, chill out a bit
BABA you got this, Jack Ma, you’re my boy!!
Not understanding this bullshit with Penn at all
Doubled down on feb calls, lets get it

Was watching BABA all morning and didn't manage to get spreads filled at the lowest dip. Ah you can't always time these things.
Teach a retard to fish
It really pisses me off how so many SQ card readers seem to default to a tip option even for transactions that never required a tip before. That has nothing to do with me buying 0dte at the top this morning.
Holding for complete annihilation just seemed more appropriate at this point.  Down from $80k to $10k now.  Just finish me off Xi.  Seize BABA.  Declare it a government run company now.
BABA starts ripping my march calls start dipping...went down 7% in the last 3 minutes as BABA ripped 5 up...🤣

Chances of arkk doing another 100% gain in 6 months?
Hey Shorter

There are a ton of companies that would fulfil that outcome along with Stripe.

The question is how many in that wave will belong to the big stakeholders. I think most people in this for the warrants will have been in for months, and like tsla, will have become personally intersected with the stock. Sell offs here are just so incentivized against. We will likely see some depreciation immediately following, its plausible, but that will let more FOMO investors in at a value price.

Her internet is garbage. Hilarious she forgot to turn her monitor on or something and she had fireworks on behind her
Lol you are clearly delusional if you think Authoritarian means communism.

China abandoned communism when Deng Xiaoping took power in the late 1970s. They have private property, competitive markets, a central government, and other characteristics that are incompatible with communism. They are a one-party state-capitalist nation, not a communist one.

Does everyone here have any idea of their history?  Since when do you have private property in communism lol
that was a brave move

MO BABAAAAAAAAA
I’m telling you all because we’re in it together. Don’t be scared, and by leap calls for BABA. Or at least a few months out. It might go down a little more, no one knows. I highly doubt it’s going below $200. Now is a good time. Print money with me. Ignore the “smart” kids that don’t belong in WSB and belong in r/investing. We’re here for high risk high rewards, that is the WSB way. 🚀
Fuck it I’m doubling down on my BABA puts
libertarians who voted on Nov 3 will move to the Repubs probably. I don't think either Dem wins in the runoff.
Going to laugh so hard if BABA somehow rips for 35 minutes to green.

Once again selling BABA puts was free money.
GME right guys? Where did the confirmation bias queers go?
The fact that everyone here is saying jump ship to the largest retailer in one of the largest countries IJ the world is a sure fire sign to buy the fucking dip.

BABA isn’t going anywhere. Chinese economy is going to the moon.

“facing no repercussions” 

ultimate bull flag
GME is slowly dipping fellas. It means two things.
Short holders are desperately trying to drive the price down, which means if it dips below 19 get back in with every spare dollar you can afford to lose.
GME is gonna jump back up next week at some point.
Again, shares, not options. No weeklies retards! If you’ve been selling at the top and buying at the bottom consistently with GME you’ve already been printing money.
Get in now because we’re either getting a MOASS or just the stock returning to its actual value, which is way higher than any of the mainstream cucks give it credit for.

Edit: A Typo
Was holding puts for almost a month I had actually given up on even breaking even. Boy was I in for a surprise.

I find genomics very interesting, but I'm worried that people may associate it with Hitler and hamper its growth.
But buy investing in China you're actually making that happen, without foreign investments they wouldn't be anywhere near as well off as they are now, and by helping them you're negatively influencing the US economy, meaning there will be less good jobs here.

Sorry bro
Lolsedans
BABA opened at -10%, way worse than I predicted.  BABA at $230 looked too cheap.  That had to be the bottom right?  way oversold right?  fuck....  options down 50% today.  as usual I rationalized myself into staying in for more pain.  nice thing is that at this point the daily total loss won't be so bad.  I'll kind of miss the days of -$8k.  Then -$4k days.  Then lots of -$2k days.  Now my position will just go out with a whimper.

In 40 minutes
what happened to crsr
GHI.v is definitely gonna POP as they have a meeting Jan 20 to affirm everything. Calls before then. 
It’s still cheap in terms of SPAC’s ~ $13 range currently 
Jan 15 $15c for a 5 bagger maybe more.
BABA coming back to life 🐂📈🚀🚀🚀
wall street still mad about the direct listing
I'm tellin' you bitches, BABA has a few more days of dumpage before it turns around.  But don't listen to me, I ain't learnt shit.

"iT's *bO*unCin*G"*

Nope, downtrends have pullbacks just like uptrends do.
Glad I sold the 12/24 GME 22C's for a profit of 10 bucks earlier, haha. Bought right near EOD yesterday.
EZ BABA V SHAPE RECOVERY
Buy rmg
What do you want for Christmas? What does every kid want, every tanager, even your granny wants? PLTR shares, that’s right! Daddy Karp told you own his skis, Merry Xmas! But not to the 🌈🐻 😉
baba 240 calls for next week might even print if this bs is over by this weekend...
[deleted]
Yep 1 EST
Power hour coming in on christmas eve like a limp dick
It’s Dec 30th. PLTR shares are sliding with the coming lock up ending. 

Karp makes a single tweet. “💎👋” the night before the end of lock up.

PLTR $40 12/31
Guys. Guys. Buy 🌽🌽🌽
Where’s that BABA intraday gain porn?
The Bears are first then the CCP. How dare they try to ignore the power of MA!
todays fake right? we open right how we closed yesterday on monday
💯 I’m loading up personally
CRWD held off the "Russians." Impressive.
QS looks like they stabilized the fuck out of that shit

^^^^^^^or ^^^^^^^holiday ^^^^^^^opex
They sold them at highest price? That sounds good the, yes?
EZ BABA RECOVERY
to mimmick my peen
[deleted]
Math checks out, 1200% gain is more than a loss.
Does marker close early today, like the banks?
Chuuuuuuch
China scary
PLTR up 5.8% for the week, GME up almost 27% and lol BABA.
Stable roads?
Finally took a 200 share position on BABA at 216, pretty great risk reward play here
😳

GL

!Remindme 4 days
Think XL can get above 30 by close?
I am down a fuck ton of money holy shit
Pull up!!

Ho Lee Fuk
GME Futures? :D
CGRO gonna hit 40 once it merges
And I was right again, testing 20 after hitting 21.43 in the opening bullrun hour.

I was doubting we see a below 20 dip today just half an hour ago, but now it looks more and more likely.

This is a rocky ride, the only thing smooth on it are our collective brains...
i wish mkt close early everyday
Trump say bye bye
[removed]
probably nothing, just the free stock
Jump out of FCEL Jan calls?
Would you be open to sharing your trading view custom chart you use?
SRACW
Dont sweat the technique
Buy VLDR dip?
Na ge
Not crazy, I wouldn't blame someone for being sketched out by ccp fuckery, I think it will recover though
BABA ripping up is so obvious
Fuck it.. I got in GME
Lost $200 but hopefully this will teach me to stop being a gullible retard 😂
Buy the dip
Agreed brother.
Why come on here and make shit up?
This sounds fake as F\*\*\*. Pics or didnt happen.
BABA, Sum Ting Wong! Wi Tu Lo!
Even if it IPO let say at 60, it'll probably open at 500 lol
Gonna run up for nio day
I will
[deleted]
Yeah I was in at 23 ish originally and then kept adding so my avg is a little higher than that. Even at $26 I would have went in there for sure. Especially now, right before xmas. A lot of downtime over the holidays for people to read up and research stuff. I think you'll see the gains continue up until liftoff on LOI.

Again, the premium you are paying here isn't lost on me. But when you take into consideration 1) the downside risk being capped (you stand to lose, if it fails completely 20-30% of the investment; compare that to the downside of an options contract) and 2) the tontine value inherent in the stock (9 commons becomes 2 warrants at $23; if you look at it in terms of share volume, that's a 22% increase just for holding the stock, not taking into consideration the absolute value gains derivative on those shares when the stock  jumps).

A deal is going to be made for a variety of reasons. The first leg of this journey is Ackman getting his hands dirty trying to catch something biblical. Even if they slip out of his grasp, he has a huge list of amazing value companies to target that will excite the market (in and out, fidelity, etc).
Baba lmao mooning
Goodbye gamestoooooooppppppp
Are we sure it’s going to go up again or is it over leveraged?
Did you buy at the top during the morning rush?
Once again I here to announce that door dash is pumping on very little volume.

Very cool, very legal!
Starting to see that lol
But think about it though. the Santa rally comes because of people's merry moods after holidays, right? This Christmas is gonna be complete shit. That should mean the market is gonna be shit, too. And if the market is shit, inexperienced investors are gonna sell out thinking "Why isn't it up? This is supposed to be the Santa rally!", causing stocks to go down even more and leading to a correction of >1 percent. 

&#x200B;

Just my two cents. I hope I'm wrong.
40 minute full thrust 🌝
That’s okay I just enjoy your stories grandpa
Already got 400 shares 🚀🚀
Got $9k and 40min before close, what's my play?
Calls going up in value on flat MU trading...
Don't matter, if they failed today already shows Republicans aint having it.
Blame the CCP
yes.
!remindme 10 days
Motherfuckers, SPY leaps will print. QQQ leaps will print. AAPL leaps will definitely print.  
Instead everyone is grabbing 12/31 GME and PLTR calls like true goddamn 🤡s
Took a nap. I was green. Woke up red. Merry fucking Christmas

JACK MA PLEASE TELL SUPREME LEADER WINNIE THE POOH YOU’RE SORRY
#Robinhood should give us a free stock for Christmas to be honest 🎄 🎁

trains dont get me to the moon 😡😡😡
Damn, why you hate your sister that much?
200 more shares GME!
Yeah that’s why I’m asking for a rebound..
They are not making any money. They are underwater, and have been this whole time. There's been about 70 million shares short for months now
Alright market. Sell off until close. Let’s get this over with
Because it’s Christmas Day?
200-1000% are full retard gains, you will get there but your gonna have to lose 100k first
#fake dump
Iv on pltr options sucks now, still wheeling though
That’s why I said in any sort of normal sense. Not some of these rich retards YOLOing weeklies with 100k
Buy the NIO dip. Nio is going to launch soon as Nio Day approaches.
WSB user with 20% OTM weeklies expiring upset becuz gween letters r now red >:(
I don’t buy. I sell.
I'd be lying if I said I knew lol. I'm just hoping it pumps
Fuck yeah my dude, $100k on the way soon! Keep it up
Wendys gift card would have been better
What tripod/remote do you use to photograph yourself?  🤢
Baba is about to rip
Or plummet to the core
What’s your play with ATO? I grabbed some 1/15 100 C but the volume is super low, you think I’m good on those?
It's taking a break.
I want off the sleigh Santa
Short sellers of GME aren't realising this. They just chase ups and lose out because they don't hold.
ARKG, which I will be putting money into each month starting in January. There’s plenty of other threads discussing why it’s such a promising sector but TLDR is genomics is going to be the future of medicine and healthcare and we are just seeing the birth of this industry. Picture investing in the internet in the 1980’s
SRACW is my gift to you

get in now
ur port going to $0
so many TP handed pussies in this sub TBH

ALL gave you good dip buys today. These 4 should be on your portfolio for January no doubt
Going all in BABA in your 401k is the most autistic thing I've heard all day. Welcome to the short bus pal, you belong here!
I bought 4/16 250c
On Monday it d better be limit up
Good to hear

why would it go up?
How much did you put in?
Thanks OP!!
No woes just boredom
If you’re going IBKR, you’ll have access to tons of margin. You could do a measured gamble - like throw it all in a 3X leveraged fund for a day.

I really like TNA for the coming year, but LABU is also intwresting w the whole genomics boom.

Also FANGU for tech 3x
Just show em your wsb profile. Im pretty sure theyd make you cfo or something

Congrats and eff you btw
Literally no one even knows about it yet. Did PLTR or CRSR take off immediately? No, it took time
/u/dhsmatt2 has a good track record, gave good advice pretty consistently but WSB is full of degenerate gamblers
It’s legit and will have a run up before Nio day on the 9th of January
happy cake day! 💎🖐
Why's GME going down?
poor
I’m hoping it pops back up on Monday. Get some back on these and then roll out
Guess who had a note in his phone to buy gme calls when it was 4.62 but decided it was worthless instead?

This guy 😎
Yeah cuz Amazon is great in the US 🤡
Well you know hate on China is what brings the upvotes nowadays
people are calling pump and dump on him, and while I think GME is a total shit stock and would never invest in it, this is a decent company STIC/BARK.
well they're about to keep making money lol
Exit strategy? You mean fucking now? Find another stonk to fw before game cock makes your bank flaccid

Yea, you can come out now.  I think,  it's jammed

Isn’t now a good time to stop though?... we should be evolved enough

As more states legalize weed, Weedmaps revenue declines (they’re forced to cut ties with unlicensed shops and deliveries once a state goes through legalization).

Screenshotted to save my account when I get dumb
best arkk fund? retarded question. none, its pltr
Yes sir anything for gains 📈
Guys I feel it in my balls, PLTR 🚀🚀🚀 next week 💎🙌
Are my 12/31 AMD 92c safe?
Power hour not sweating
PLTR forming a giant 1 month long bull flag. Consolidating on declining volume. January is gonna be nice for PLTR.
It’s sad WSBbot is gone cause this post is trash.

Ya, got carried away 😁.

They reconvene on Monday to continue fucking everyone so who knows
Thanks
True true.... But this shit dropped tencent too tho soo point still stands.
no they won't lol.
Bought the dip yesterday at close. Cashed out my call today at 270% profit. #onlywintoday
How do you people not know how to set limit orders?
So it’s power hour now?
ARKG or ARKW idk why but I want Cathie to continue to be my sugar momma
Lol
[deleted]
Be patient. It’s at the pinch point of a pennant. Breaking out soon.
How’s Power Hour treating y’all? Closed out all of my positions and waiting for the last 5 minutes to open some for next week.
Besides Ryan Cohen taking a huge stake in GameStop is their any other upside about it? I mean they lose money and they certainly aren’t a startup
Your buying power is 2x how much I have in my bank account... stfu.
Thanks
There’s no way I can afford to pay two mortgages. I wanted it to be a quick recovery
Is god punishing PLTR? All good news about new govt contracts and all this company does is stay flat or go down.
The EV Mustang looks cool but ok
Congressional republicans are the world's biggest cucks. They haven't been fiscally conservative for 4 years and now suddenly they care about the deficit again.
The yt crowd is 🤡🔫
at the next red day.
Just bought more. Alibaba is here to stay. There’s room in the Chinese market for competitors and everyone still has room to grow. Half of the country is still underdeveloped.
Great. Your life savings is in the hands of the CCP. How comforting
[deleted]
How difficult would it be to get a job at ARK? Lol
what dip do i buy
Sounds like the CEOs job description in the title of this position.
Sounds like they need to remove the CEO. Lazy fuck.
China is doing "antitrust shit" with them. Probably an excuse for ccp to get in cheap and pump that shit to the moon if you ask me.
Nice, I just got CRSR at a discount!  One week later....  Nice, I just got CRSR at a discount! 

And repeat....
Should I go all in Amazon dec 31 $3245 calls ?

If you bought BABA on October 27th, forgot about it until now, and then checked your account you'd be down 32%.
You don’t cause retards don’t actually make tendies
Are the big tech antitrust suits priced in yet or should I load up on puts
GME stills manage to ruin Christmas. Managements fault
With stonks money?
Not a good move. Baba is a shell company for the real Chinese BABA. 

Check SEC filings. Stay far away my dude.
I would encourage you at this point put 60% of your earnings into dividends. 

Something like 3,847 shares of AGNC to get a monthly dividend income of $461.64 until you sell those shares. Of course they say diversify the portfolio so you could throw in the others. There is an app called “the rich” on the Apple store that lists out other high Yeild dividend stocks. I don’t think AGanC is on there but it’s $15.60 for $0.12 dividend a month. $1.2 for every 10 you hold. 


Noted I do hold options for AGNC. 
AGNC $16.5c $0.01 12/31/20
AGNC $16.0c $0.04 01/08/21
AGNC $17.0c $0.04 01/29/21

Doesn't matter. Those posts have an impact on stock price, one way or the other. I didn't comment on the validity of said report.
A run up from ~15 to ~22 in 2 days doesn't impress you, nothing ever will.
[deleted]
Just got to play the market sometimes.. watch the herd of sheep and act accordingly.. sometimes financials and analysis doesn’t mean anything.. this is a circus
Stimmy is fuck but we're also on a short trading week.

Every short week this year has had a selloff ahead of the holiday.
So overblown but I bet we see red again Monday before a rebound
Wasn't the avg. volume 120mil+ in May/June?
WHO loves GameStop? Literally everybody I've ever heard of in real life or reddit hates that company... both employees and customers.
Quite a few of them until $12
Gme???  I was told thered be a squeeze
Wtf baba
Because China will dick all over the US in 50 years

WSB is getting into the 2021 commodities rotation. Inflatrating the boomer stocks before the boomers know what hit them. HEY JIM CRAMER! Merry Christmas you filthy animal!
NIO day coming up.  Hold for now
I paper handed out at $16 after earnings from $13 entry 😪
No reason, just China.
Absolutely, like the retard I am
So when are we getting money?
Compared to other wsb gains here pulling in 200 - 1000%... I’d say it feels small. However, it is better than the 8% I’m getting in my 401k and rothIRA. 

One lesson I’ve learned is that puts always fuck me over and weeklies always fuck me over. I will never do weeklies ever again. I’d rather have slower gains over a longer time and not freak out when things dip 2% in a day. It’s a lot less stressful. But still stressful.
In 40min
Maybe, just maybe, institutional money was what was keeping the market green all along
Ford should make decent ICE cars. They had 50 years to beat the Japanese and couldn’t.

The roof flew off their new model.
Icln leaps 33c you’re welcome
10am
Well that was a Federal Intervention bounce if I’ve ever seen one.
Lol, we thought the shorts would give up on GME. Nah, these idiots are digging their own grave deeper
So you’re saying this is a no go
Thank you for the in-depth response! Answered all my questions
It’s finding it’s support at around 18.20s also there are signs of an uptrend coming. Give it another week or so before anything drastic
BABA RED -> My port that does not have BABA RED = Cyber Covid Virus ? 🤔
Damn dude nice, feels bad I only had like 40 bucks to spend on pltr or I couldve started profiting myself. Currently if I sell ill only have gained like 7bucks thanks to the price of buying and selling.
My gains got run over by a reindeer
I’ve been staying away from BABA this whole time, but I bought calls for next week. Just a small position. Think it’s at peak fear here.
[deleted]
FDX went down $10 today after it’s high of $276, with the only news since then being a price target upgrade.  Yup makes sense.
Holding lots of shares. Fucked for now
LETS GO
I’m sitting on 25 shares @265.19 average rip 😭
Legit thought 290 was a steal, then 280, then 270, then 260, then 255, then eh now I’m stuck painfully bag holding 🙃
SPY is green still.
Idk how weedmaps makes money but I'm bongs deep in sspk
What’s my prize if I’m right?
Soon, play is for 18-20 dollars
Rmg!

What time the market close today for Pacific time?
Yes this is really impressive.
Let’s say I have an ITM debit spread on 12/31 and I close the short leg eod 12/31 and close the long leg 1/1... is there any rule against claiming the short leg as a loss for 2020? Or is that covered under the irs definition for “straddles”
“Not bad for a 19 year old”

*tiny pp gains*
That was the move clearly
AAPL kept up the momentum. VLDR and LAZR on the other hand...
Yeah, but trump is a dip shit lol I think once he is not longer and office, hopefully the negotiations with china stop being shit, actually if that happens it may moon as it should
BABA is opening +5-10% on Monday. The anti-trust news is overblown.
But all your cash in $GAY. Not kidding.
Lmao that sounds like 25-30hrs a week at Wendy’s cut the man a break he will eventually get promoted from fries to the double stacks.
Fuck you bezos and jack ma
If SPY ends red, buy calls.
Chinese government proves if they have a monopoly
Closes at 10 right?
ARKG 4/16/21 $140c

Just bought 100 of them

This dip is a blessing, please do the same. Thank me later.
Riskier than arkk, but has big potential. Those pharmaceutical companies moon hard when they get good trial results or approval for new drugs
The house will pass the $2k stimi Monday buy buy buy!

Fake bounce you’ll be fine
PLTR keeps building lower lows it’s still bullish AF
Ok bud. SPY has barely moved since yesterday's sell-off.
Down
Roughly 220k. I made a second mortgage after it dropped to 260 and bought half calls half shares.
Why's today RED?
Beautiful dip on GOEV today.
Most obvious dead cat.
I think 212 to 217 was short covering personally. Not a lot of motivated longs out there imo
You’re retarded if you think BABA will go lower
Paper hands boi
How do you say tendies in retard
There’s a reason puts are priced much higher than Calls for QS dumbass
It is down 2% after a 30% run up. Unplug for a while.
Senate rejected the revised bill today because they kept all the foreign money the same just increased the payments to 2k which kind of misses the point
Go easy on the coke fellow autist

This defeats the argument that nobody buys at GameStop. Plenty of fucking normies go to GameStop. The name is fucking synonymous with gaming for fuck sake, of course your granny is gonna go to it first to buy you a new PS5...
Game stop. Technical analysis. 20.20 is the floor for the Gme and the people. Only up from here. Add 10. 30 eoy price target.
Listen if you get paid my March 300 make money - let’s hope
If your not greedy and you didn’t pay out the ass for them, then maybe. If you can sell as late as end of next week with a stock price of 26.75 and be in the black then I think you’ll be okay. 

Risky play my friend. At this point I would just be trying to find a good exit point. Don’t try to hit a home run on this one.
Damn dude, just think of all the cool shit you could’ve bought with $10k!

Why tf is alibaba down 15%? Is there any reason?
F
Aside from politics which is very iffy if repubs keep senate-- it really depends on how the fund is actively managed. For example, RUN was biggest holding in October.  Now it's PLUG.  If they move and shake right and politics helps, could be lucrative. Personally, I think most of the big plays in the sector are exhausted and won't have earnings growth to justify these valuations.
You're not the first to ask. That should be a simple change. I'll do it
Correct. Chamath might be the next one after Cathie.
Shares on BABA is the play. It's now 100% of my 401k at $218 average

STOP THE COUNT
haha
Easier to pump.
Still mad I didn’t buy in when I saw them at 16
Fuck it, I'm in on MVIS. Let's see where this goes!
Then watch it go higher.
It remains illegal for AMZN to have a good day
Why would anyone, who's not Chinese, invest in Chinese companies?
If you bought BABA on July 1st, forgot about it until now, and then checked your account you'd have about the same exact amount in your account as you did then.  6 months for nothing.
Man so weird the concept I bet must of us have for money now. Down 3000 this week but said wtf when I bought my girl makeup for 70 bucks lmao
Thoughts on AAL calls? March-May?
All in

Yikes. This was actually good DD. What is going on around here
It's Early Power Hour; BUY any dips--statistically, the days after Christmas Santa rally. + upside on stimulus. Let's go!!!
Once TSLA goes the rest of the market will go
Robinhood is 1k free margin, then 2.5% after that... Use 1k with a stop loss sell.
Margin called?

What's the total loss in dollars you're looking at?
Tesla announces new EV and stonks go up, Ford does it and it just stays in boomer land 😤
It’s just contract after contract dude, conference on the 6th I think and then live demo on the 26th followed by earnings after, strong chart, strong company, what else... oh yeah 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
They also post clickbait titles and thumbnails saying March 2.0 is coming every week so

waiting for it to do something since weeks ago, it only went bad, maybe it'll move with the deal
this is just robot wars.  we are all just along for the algo roller coaster ride.  That sell off yesterday in the last 10 minutes was utterly absurd.  The entire s and p 500 chart looked like it had an infinite slope at the end of the day yesterday. Now a big dip with a stupid bounce up.  Computers are assholes.
BABA c 215
closed my CLF calls yesterday at a small profit. holding on MT Mar 19 '21 $30  though
It's okay boys. I remember this all too well. It was Christmas Eve of 2018. Everything was blood fucking red but then a Christmas miracle happened. Mnuchin activated the PPT and with their ample liquidity, boxing day was the greenest MF day I've ever seen. Since boxing day this year is on a Saturday, I have no idea what's going to happen.

Power hour ?
Don't catch a falling knife.
right i mean why would companies redo fleets as hybrid when ev fleets will be coming   so i took a loss also  after really thinking bout it.  pure pump  it aint nikola but it still shit
Makes the 800 shares I bought at $13 seem pathetic.  I got desperate and bought another 500 today at $19.  Which is dumb since my target for this stock/spac was to double which is $20.  I believe it was supposed to open at $10 but immediately started trading $12-13.  BarkBox is a solid company with good revenues now, good revenue growth, and good margins.  I'm going to hold until about $25 and then possibly get out.
Which brokerage is the best for this? Or rather, which one let's me use this algo?
Feb (after earnings), April, and June.
Dont just sit there watching your stocks drop like flies, get in where the getting is good. C3.AI (AI) is on the move to 200 eod. Pum pump pump it up.

True. BABA is so undervalued though, even moreso now, that the government could take pieces and it would still be a good stock to own. Obviously depends on what they take though.

Have a Merry Christmas guys. Ha ha ha.

Here's a post of mine regarding my investment beliefs on my QS post. This regards Peter Thiel and Palantir and the long game in the software and EV space. I hope it raises your conviction to hold your shares a little longer.

I like how Elon controls his supply chain, right down to owning the nickel mines etc.

You're points are solid. Musk will maximize conventional battery technology as you describe with increased energy density.

The delta between the two battery technologies poses no immediate (10 years) threat to Elon's business.

From a Technologist POV:

Ultimately the best conventional battery will be as good as the worse solid state battery.

From the Corporate POV:

The holders of the right patents will ultimately win this war. The mega cap companies know this and made a sport out of stealing IP and losing in Court. It's actually a speculative revenue stream to them.

So long as they break even and wound their competitor., its all fair game.

Never discount the role of the Courtroom. Microsoft under Bill Gates is a Master at this. Especially when there were still rules like enforced Anti-Trust. Now its just rhetoric.

Elon Musk should take stock in that. Bill Gates plays a chess game that could humble Musk one day. Gates cornered the world market of PC Operating systems because he always studied weaknesses. Elon's market share is next to nothing at the moment in the overall car market. Yes I can be bearish and reasonable too.

Im not dying to buy an electric car either or any new car for that matter. An EV battery vehicle is still a luxury, and most people will hold out longer for the technology to mature. Yes an EV battery vehicle,  not an EV vehicle using an electric battery of any sort. (Analogous to Gas Powered vehicles)

Musk should buy Volkswagen while he is still able too. His stock won't hold up forever in this EV commodities market. (Holding NIO, QS and FSR) I believe China's pollution crisis will drive NIO ahead of Tesla sometime soon. Pollution created to make the majority of our products, including a near monopoly on EV parts and batteries. Why should Musk act as a middleman to the Chinese customer base? He won't much longer. NIO and Tesla will wage war for the European market.

Peter Thiel can handle Bill Gates or Google. He created the Operating System for government and large Enterprises called Palantir. He has peppered the entire industry by funding startups that are positioned to replace uncreative business models like Snowflake.

Palantir's superior mastery of data analytics combined with his bigger picture approach will humble Microsoft or Google one day.

Good thing Thiel is a Technologist like Musk who now owns a piece of SpaceX too. Peter is far more Corporate than Musk. That is known. They are good friends to the benefit of both of them and us futurists.

Anyways, back on track. QS is well positioned to own the rights to the Electric solid state battery of the future.

Technological Autism (Musk) vs the Long Game (Thiel). Not even a contest. Thiel will die far richer than Musk.

PLTR, NIO, TSLA, and QS will go BBRRrrrrrrrrrrrr.

FSR too lol Br Br Br. Henrik will sell his nice Ocean Design, He's destined to design Apple's Project Titan EV. Steve Jobs favourite car was the Fisker designed BMW Z8. 

Tim Cook is mirroring the Fisker Inc. business model. Tim Cook knows the way. Sorry Tim Apple.
Which is good for smaller competitors. Long stonks
No I didn’t, but business that did can still speak out against it. Everyone is going to operate in their best interest, if the government is giving out free money of course you take it to stay competitive with your peers, but you can still hold the opinion that they shouldn’t give it in the first place.

> Alright fine business can be hard, let’s take away all the tax breaks then

Sure. The government should be operating on a budget half or even a quarter of what it’s currently operating on though, so as long as taxes are cut half or by 75%, then yeah, remove tax breaks.

>the fed

The fed isn’t congress. The fed doesn’t give out free money to people and business’. Fed action is not relevant to our conversation. Although, I think the FED does a terrible job and they did cause the Great Depression through their mismanagement of the dollar supply.
Aw fuck i fucked it

100 shares of aapl and sell calls on it
I was literally you and stopped doing options except cheap yolos. I just buy shares now.
I sold my BLNK puts too early. Lost out on $2300 of potential gains. But made $1600. So not too shabby. Off to bed 🛌 😴 

BABA September 2021 285c!!! 🚀
I forgot I had this. I mean, my numbers are small because I am poor and dumb, but I picked this up back in 2019 for like $3/share. Only got 30 shares, but  this vid makes me happy as fuck.
There’s a feeling that goes along with buying FDs. It’s not always positive. It often has fear, frustration or the sense that maybe you’ve bit off more than you can CHWY.

But doing the real thing matters. Days wasted on "investing" may keep you busy, but they never seem to go anywhere. A life spent on real risk may not always be the easiest or most stable, but it’s the one that pays in the end.
I'm not an alcoholic, I'm just addicted to seeing you pretty.
Fuck it going in on BABA
More than we'll end up getting from stimulus.
Idk what you’re in but I’m up bigly this montj

It’s only a problem when the lil guys do it 🙄🙄
How old are you?
Let me explain what’s going on: this year sucked for normal people and kids, they are pissed off cause they had to cancel Disney vacations this year, couldn’t go play outside and shit. 

Enter Christmas and kids want something big to make up for the shitty year, they want a PS5, but we all know that the only ps5s are like 10x normal price  and since this fuckers didn’t give us our stimulus well what can you do as a dad???

Obviously sell your stocks to buy some nice presents
Still a negative fuck on people, threw a few hundred to my local pet shelter though
hey ma we got chicken or what?? MA!!!
YOLO'ed into BABA calls
Fr I just saw the headline that said “stocks up...”. Which ones!? had to double check my shit because like 13/15 of mine are red lol
Yes! I didn't think Jack Ma would let this drag on for so long, but the fact the big boys closed their millions of dollars bullish options after todays drop is not a good sign

I saw another post saying it will hit $25 in Jan then blow through $30 by earnings potentialy mooning into June. Too bad my calls are probably too short
Thing is there’s no oversight and corruption runs rampant in these Chinese stocks. Worst of all. If you don’t play ball with Chinese government, they’ll crush you until you submit. That’s all I have to say on the matter, I don’t want to get detained next time I visit HK.
Imagine a world with no war and no weird shit.  Just business and pumping stocks and Brrrrr money printing .  Life would be so much better
The "Analyst" that gave FUBO the $8 price target has been barred from FINRA to act as broker or associating with a broker-dealer firm. He's trash.
Haha I'm down because I bought at the top. Whoops. Let's just hope it moons sometime.
Man December really sucks fucking ass. I thought this was gonna be such a huge month after the election but nope... flatter than my sisters tits
Dear VIX, u gave us Christmas in March. Now, how about Christmas in December Thanks! Your friend, Bearly Legal.
Nice
I can live with a red day that looks like this. A day where my portfolio is down this much but SPY is still green would piss me off.
I love chevelle too, just not actually seeing that shit
dips is being bought up 🎄🎅
Bought 10x april 26c when steel daddy educated us on MT and steel for the first time 10 days ago. Return on my positions Already up 71% as of today despite of the last two days.

Lead us deeper into tendie town papa steel!!!

BABA CALLS BABYYYY
Mah Belleh! I ate a babeh! ARKG
Your comment yesterday about not going in when wsb is in stopped me from FOMO. Although, I have not professed to step 2 of finding a good spac close to Nav. I bought THBR a few weeks back that’s up but other than that I’m still trying to learn how to spot one early on before the pump

If your looking for more information on this trade check out the investor section of the VIACOMCBS website. The UBS event is there when they mention the investor day and the recent earnings call highlights the strength of Pluto. They crushed earnings recently.

Holy shit why did you buy such an early expiration
The shit is down pennies on the day and was up the last two days.  You could have pottery clay hands and still hold easily.  MT is not a weekly play, it's a monthly one.
Come on you motherfucking GME

But..like most here wud say.. bUy tHE DiP
I have have been swing trading OTGLY since October. The price dipped several times due to Cyberpunk 2077 delays, and more recently due to the negative reception of the game. If you bought the dips and sold within a few days like me, you made several 10-20% gains.

I took my newest position after the dip caused by Sony's PSN decision. The stock price has since become far less volatile, and headlines in the news about Cyberpunk 2077 are starting to simmer down. This is no longer about swing trading, the investor's time to shine has come. I'm in several hundred shares for under 18.70.

If you're reading this right now, you can pick up shares at under 18.40 to either start or dilute your position.

tldr; unsure of specifics but RH apparently does support the warrants and they will be accessible upon the split. 23 exercise price 30 days post merger or July 2020, whatever comes first. Good luck...

I don't use Robinhood because it greatly limits my ability to make moves based on my own research. FNMA is a prime example. Many posters saying, "oh sounds interesting but its OTC!"

Then they just don't take a position with the only reason being they have an iPhone app. Just get a real account somewhere, most are free.

Anyways that's my RH rant, as for your questions I therefore have no deep knowledge of the RH system, but did see on twitter the other day that someone got a response from RH Customer Service confirming they would get the warrants.

Exercise price is $23 30 days post merger or July 2021. You have to waive the $20 NAV offer during merger to collect the warrants, 2 for every 9 commons

People online are complaining about the premium to NAV. Its really hilarious. Considering the likelihood of a deal closing (100%) and the tontine structure, even if you got in now, at a 30% premium to the value of the net assets, you stand to appreciate by who knows what % by the tontine.

And anyone who's read this DD and the S1 and then still comes back and says "maybe he doesn't make a deal", you are unreachable. There are over 150 targets in the pool with a few of the whales (the one's he's really doing work on in the first 6-8 month since the stock listed) mentioned and receiving hype. The absolute worst case scenario here is that he captures a wildly undervalued blue chip company at a great valuation and turns it into a monster like he did with Canadian Pacific, Chipotle and his recent CDS in the spring.

Another note: lots of negative chatter re: food industry. I think for a lot of reasons he won't really opt to go this route if there is an interesting fintech or media play he can make instead (look at the composition of the board). That said, something like In and Out would absolutely moon. Family run, established brand, extremely simple product that people are obsessed about and a gigantic runway in terms of expansion to central and eastern states and Canada. Ackman loves Canada, and loves quality companies.

EDIT: sorry for the rant. I added a TLDR for you, dearest OP commenter

haha thanks. You have to be a whopper of an idiot to lose in the last few months. Between QS, TSLA and renewables I'm a happy camper. If GME hit's 19.80 it's sold!
Damnit. Sinking ship now. Losing good mods and inspiring people. I want to know where they're going to.
GME... didn’t even dip that hard, and will shoot next week or Jan
Hold on to stock bud.......it ain’t going lower. China will slap them w a fine remind Ma whose in charge.......

Question:

i have 8 12/31 $23c on GME.

Exit position and take this loss, or is there a chance to recover some of that loss going into next week? my butthole is scorched man.

Edit: wrong date
Im just looking at what is says on the RH spy page
Welp. My 12/31 AMD calls I bought earlier aren't looking great
Yeah, no way not up by then.  Definitely not selling shit
buy the sq dip?
guess ill try an amzn 3180c for 2.7 why not.
Most SPACs don't have options
Hey, I use IBKR as well!! I have a few momentum trading ideas in mind but as you said, I'm too retarded to actually execute and follow up with it. 

When you manage to implement something please let us know! I wouldn't mind something that I can just use in trading view that alerts me when to buy and sell. Thanks for doing gods work.
Wow neat trade
Someone tell me why ICLN is a buy for 2021
I bought them after.  Got some nice cheap ATM Jan calls that should pay off these Christmas gifts.
I got the $29 on the dip. I think it’ll gap up over the holidays. Good luck!
Feeling really good about my decision to swap calls for shares before the year ends. Yikes

Eh so you paid a little more than you should have.  Just hold the stock, Bark Box is a good company this thing should go up and make new highs in the coming weeks

Increases are 100% passed on in the COG’s. That’s why they have Price Time of Shipment policy now. They don’t know what those COG’s will be, but being a miner and shredder and able to supply 50%+ of their own raw materials - they should have nice margin enhancement.

I’d sell. I played fcel for a few weeks but never held overnight. It traded between $7 and $12 like clockwork before the last dilution. They got some good news and I’d say $14 is probably the top of the channel now. I bought late yesterday and sold at close to get out even. Or, I could be wrong and it goes up next week. I don’t have enough faith in the company to hold it.
Hey, that's what Cathie and Buffet do. Hats off to him

the otm calls that i see people buy here are insane...
I have not seen their software. Ive kept close tabs on their press releases, their website, I follow their LinkedIn. I save and digest comments from reddit users who claim to work with it; government, military, and civilian. I have repeatedly returned to their SEC filings for deep dives. I just fucking love data organization technology. 

I'd like to think, as an outsider, that I have a decent grasp on what they offer. I will also freely admit I'm just some guy with no first hand experience in the tech industry.

Rant/soapbox:

100 years ago "we", as a world,  built and revolutionized physical infrastructure for our modern world. Physical roads, physical com lines, physical retail buildings, physical data organization, physical safe money deposits. Today, we're just beginning to build the digital infrastructure that will support us for the next 50-100 years. Digital currency, digital com lines,  digital "roads" (telecom and fiber), digital retail, digital data organization. Palantir, and a host of other emerging companies, stand to capitalize on this digital revolution in infrastructure. I'm bullish on all of it.
I loved that game. Thanks.

Whole fucking china bout to buy some MT Steel. This is like Christmas for me. Wait. It is literally.
You ever bought anything off wish? They’ll promise you a Bugatti and ship you a bumper car

May be a retarded question, but since higher prices don't necessarily mean higher margins if COGS increase in line. Is $MT not going to get margin squeezed or at least margin stabilization at higher prices due to the higher cost/shortage of raw input?
Solid logic to the moon

Sad noone here suggested the AirT blow up
Such a fucking baby.
The only real downside here is scenario 1 since taking the company private wouldn't let people other than RC benefit from the shift he puts in place. If the other shareholders are bought out at a reasonable price relative to the price today (let's say a buyout of $25-$30 per share) then we'll miss out on RC taking the company to a >$10 billion value (>$150 per share). I'm hoping for an announcement regarding RC becoming CEO and putting in his own board while not taking the company private (which is realistic since he would need $2 billion to buy out the company at $30 per share), which would set up a short squeeze where you can sell at the top and buy back in when the stock crashes to earth for a long-term play on RC's vision.
Pay off my student loans? 😂 jk good shit.

OH FUCK  
spy is red
ok i picked up more shares too
Part of my thesis is they wouldnt be stupid enough to buy it. Maybe im wrong
Fuck.
Trade more as you wish. It’s your money.  But are you smart or lucky?  If you don’t know the difference your money may be sad.
Fantastic deal
Yea bc its gonna be the highlight of global plays next year. Countries need to repair the damage covid has done to manufacturing supply chains. Like OP said too much volume for this to pop off in just a week or month

GME
Thank you
In an hour
i think that will be fine. mine are all 12/31 so you're safer than me. just don't be greedy with profit taking/cutting.
I’ve got both because I believe in the company long term so I got me some stock. I’ve also got calls because I believe the company is undervalued, if you like analysts’ opinion they have OPEN low at $30 mean at $85 and High at $120. Therefore, being super conservative the stock will at least hit $30. 

It’s competitors Zillow is at $120 and Redfin at $80. I like OPEN business model better and I believe in due time OPEN will dominate both Zillow and Redfin. It also helps that the queen Cathie Wood keeps on picking up shares of OPEN for her Ark funds.
Hey there! I hate to break it to you, but it's actually spelled _mon**e**tize_. A good way to remember this is that "money" starts with "mone" as well. Just wanted to let you know. Have a good day!

I am on margin account where I trade options and 100% of the time I have 100% equity. By definition you cannot buy options on margin. I had 20 strike calls long and 21 strike calls short. I was fully covered. And I had a limit GTC order placed from yesterday night trying to close my options today at more favorable terms. 

Exactly when they attacked GME at slightly after 11:00 AM, when stock was trading around 20.65/20.70 range, i was liquidated at market rate. My order was modified and submitted.

Friend of mine sold his BABA calls for a 35k loss.. he was even a few days ago
So puts at open. Got it.
I appreciate the guidance papa Vito! If you’re correct you will change my life!
You got to grab baba at 215 man

Do people really think the government is going to shut down the network that powers 45% of their exports
people will laugh but this company could be worth more than google in 5-10 years. If the ability for an individual to sort through internet data is a half trillion dollar idea, imagine how much the ability for a business to sort their own data is worth. The same way every person uses google, soon every business/organization will use PLTR. Google had competitors as well, do we even have meaningful competitors in this space yet?

Google had to monitize their tech by using ads because the website was free. At least PLTR is targeting entities that actually have budgets for this sort of thing.
BTFD on BABA.  

It's basically a national champion for tech.  China will not break them up.  They will add regulation so Alibab opens up the 1 or 2 option to other retailers, but Alibaba will still be dominant because economies of scale.

Alibaba also has the best research in AI in China.  And AliHealth is huge.  just BTFD in stocks for your retirement fund.
Yes, because your broker wanted to fill exactly @20, but the stock’s been @19, so it’s not what you wanted to buy at. Sooo easy man, just do your DD
Not very Sneks today

If I spent half the time I spent here researching and doing DD, I’d be rich rn

Hmmm
COMMENCE POWER HOUR!
Any dips to buy at close??
💎💎👋👋
Damn. Anyone here have BABA calls before today? On the other hand, anyone here have puts?
Very sought after as well
I got butt kcuffed by Canoo also.  I'm guessing CEO's comments were not helpful either.
Okay, I’m in a 40% position right now... looking to DCA over the next few weeks. Any idea when SSPK is expected to merge? I read Q1-2 2021
One hour to go.

Power hour or sour hour?
We all did lol
HERE. WE. GO.
Thats what I think. I sold puts on it. So if it goes down I am screwed.
Are markets closed early today?
Story time: Last Friday I held two FCEL 9c till expiration. I was under the impression TDA would close them automatically since I didn't have any buying power but I wake up Monday with 200 extra shares and an $1800 margin call.

I'm still holding the shares which are up 30% today. I sold half of them yesterday when it went over $13. I'm just gonna hold and see how long TDA will let me keep them. If it pops again I can sell enough ccs to cover my margin. Is this even legal?
I am literally pumping everything I have into baba calls at $200
Isnt the china thing not another, on top thing to what was already going on? So an additional catalyst?

I agree. This will be the third red week in a row. Last time it happened was in March it shot up like 19% the following week. I'm hoping for 10% increase before 1/15
Every stock is in red. What a way to celebrate Christmas 🎅Ho Ho Ho, Merry Christmas!

JK either way I don’t care

I know theres enough of you retards to pump aapl past 134 by eod
Your mom messaged me to stop it
Lmao on baby gates
So 4 dollars?
Make your own decisions
That's a valid point. Many people don't have enough experience. Diversification is quite important. Buy low. Don't use leverage. Some of them ignore these rules. 

If someone is doing high stake gambling, then taking profit is pretty important, at least get the original investment back.
wait a bit, until institutions can react on the news. the load big !
Yep real estate is due for disruption. They vertically integrate the entire clusterfuck process. I am long on both Z and OPEN I believe they are both winners long term, assuming this sector really takes off.
Come on Tim 🍏 go up
First to $100

Lmao at your flair
Yes 👏

shit manipulated as fuck so you got a chance
you donkeys have pushed STIC up way too far to get a good entry. I guess I will have to wait until options are available and sell puts to get assigned.
Would it be a good idea to hedge my BABA calls with one or two puts expiring next week?
Bottom is in boys, back up the truck and load the fuck up
that's pretty good. kinda feels like when I bought BA last year at $330.
Somehow only down $10 for day...
I’m laughing at those paper hands that sold SQ today.
Then good luck to you, I honestly hope the ignorance of Chinese power struggle would stop the dip. I really enjoy the memes and retardation here so I all homoly hope you fuckers don't neck yourself because of their endless "who has a bigger dick" contest.
GME is squeezing as predicted. Just not the shorts but the wsb's balls
do you hate having money
Yeah this seems like a great couple month out call buy
I have 5k worth of both. Will buy more at dips. Thanks
SQ you’re doing amazing sweetie
I had 75 shares @ 13.92  
Sold my 1 TSLA stock (sorry papa Musk) to get 30 more @ 20.38

Buy the dip on BABA?
Finally in PLTR on this low volume dip. Let’s 🚀
sq daddy
depends on how much money the central party members have invested in BABA and if they have  exited already.

If they haven't, this is a good plan to let the world know Xi is in charge, teach Ma his place, while also allowing party members to get a better entry point before letting the probe give him a slap on the wrist and it rebounds.
Got them too.
That's what I'd suggest, as long as it is within your risk parameters - e.g. not making your portfolio too dependent on just this one company.
Keep selling covered calls on PLTR through Jan?
xi jinping was upset so he made a few calls and shaved off 300B mkt cap from the biggest company in China. Let that sink in.

All hail lord Xi
I choose to believe the only reason my account has seen so much alternating red and green this week is to be festive in the spirit of Christmas. I just need the festivities to end on green by EOD
tsla is better hedge than spy puts
RH doesn't have market orders for options. They only do limit orders
He's been unbanned (ban probably lasted less than an hour)
did the same this year started with 2k and at 4.1k rn
I am shocked GME hasnt diluted at 20... Their management really is dumb as fuck.

Invest in yourselves and give the gift of SPY 370c
when u nut but she keeps suckin
Not for a short squeeze play. I buy and hold, short sellers pay about 20% interest on their borrowed shares until they give up and cover.
I’ve never had a single good experience with baba. Fuck man need this shit to REVERSEEEE
I’d buy these dips if it weren’t for the long weekend ahead
How are the indexes green? It seems as if everyone is fucked on this holy day.
How so? 25—>100—>300 at prices between $19-$21.50. Up, down, up more.
Looking at your calls down 90% is a religious experience.
Im like -15% on shares, -40% options.  It's hold until worthless or get lucky from here.   Grabbed a few GME calls for 20c 1/15 tho
The majority of the Santa rally normally occurs AFTER Christmas.
just buying shares.. IV is too high for calls

Thats bigger than the severance check when i lost my job of 3 years, so well done, congrats!

Fuck. I’ve been balls deep with 6/18 calls since a few days after your original post and doubled up so far. Do you think rolling June calls into September/October is a good idea with the next gap up?
Ok, let's go ahead and add "santa claus rally" to the list of boomer lies.

Yes, definitely expected, Gotta think. its end of year, last minute christmas people getting in as much profit. And a bunch if panic sellers jumping on the sell train. It’ll shoot up again
PLTR 300$ by 2021 !!! Easy money
Welp.... bought the dip. They seem like good friends. Hopefully it'll work out! :)
Picked up a starter position. Thanks

Unlike most of the hot EV plays lately, HYLN actually has revenues now, not in 2026
Wish I didn't buy 4 shares this morning.. I had 6 shares. Hard not to make it an even 10 haha

It’s been bouncing between upper resistance and lower support trend lines the past few weeks, forming a bullish pennant, and in the next few days it’ll have to make a decision. We could see it break 29.5, 30, 31 and after that it’s clear sky’s 🚀
Probably bounce but I wouldn't hold the bounce.

you can see he is rolling it in to GME right now.   At least he stands by his stance.
BABA dip buyers should take profit and watch Monday.
founded in 1865 jfc was abe lincoln playing snake when he got capped????
Careful with the lockup release date EOY.  I’m waiting to get past that before doing the same as you.
Before earnings - $28. After earnings a pop and blue sky. I thought this was going to be short term, but now developments out of China and scrap prices jumping as much as they have coupled with order books booked out until June - this has further legs for AT LEAST September/October.
So glad that you locked in some gains. 

Nobody goes broke taking a profit.

Best of luck to you!
This sub is great. My retirement account dropped from like 13k to 9k before I started looking through here (back in March of this year). Without any options and 7% contributions from a $65k salary, it’s sitting in the $50k range (hit $60k last week but had a pull back).

Thanks WSB!

The housing market is actually on fire right now. They’re having supply chain issues with various products, but forecasted volumes for 2020 are being exceeded by most of the big players. Home prices increased across the board during COVID since the resell market has been so hot, people are getting great mortgage rates (the lender’s problem, not so much the builder’s), and material costs are being passed on to the consumer.
So, those vans will be rented not sold?
Nah I'm fucked as of today.  So pissed I didn't sell my options s yesterday when there was hope
Same
WSB has lost its meme power. Maybe we can pump something for a day or so but I'm not sure we will see weeks of running anymore. A month ago PLTR and NIO was making everyone stupid gains for weeks  straight
So i should double down
Mango was right, its chinese virus!! Baba killed whole mArket!
Hope everyone has a merry Christmas, I’m red today so stealing presents for collateral

ccp: "we have found no wrongdoings in alibaba's part"

*stock recovers and goes to all time highs*
Yeah, it wouldn't surprise me to see a bearish attack soon.

If we get 2 green days followed by 1 red one, I'm down. I have no options, just shares, so I can ride this out however long it takes.

I'll probably be adding more next month, payday can't come quick enough...
Who has alibaba puts lol

What do u think it will end today/next week at/ open Monday at?
i bought more ARKG at 105.9 today so I know the feels broo
Baba 300c 1/22 alright alright
Probably 1/15. No 1/18 expiration lol.
Comeon BABA, lets break that 220.  Crazy swing in options today

Dang I have shares and I am not this confident. Also not sure how the runoff results will affect this if at all. That’s right around when they were going to announce partnerships. The Apple Car announcement kind of shat all over this too. Holding for now though. 💎👋🏻

Overreaction for baba ? Do calls for 2 weeks from now might cash in ?

bought the BABA dip with shares and calls.  to put things in perspective BABA makes 50% MORE revenue than AMZN at 1/3 the PE ratio..... if this was an American company it be $500 easy.
I let them ride an then my short term plays with my hedges usually balances everything out but I couldn’t predict this shit was going to happen so I wasn’t set up properly
Sexy to btfd
We'll see about that. Looks like people are selling in preparation for possible shutdown on Monday. Then we'll really fall.
Baba delisted
SPY X-mas sell off?
Aye aye captain
Those TSLA 665 and 660 calls have been one big game of hot-potato alllll day
Bought 5 more BABA to DCA. Thanks
In in for 200 share already, and I'm probably going to pump more in

42% up.  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯ and my dogs love those things
Someone once tried to tell me the US’s press was as unfree as North Korea’s lol
Might buy more tbh

Your not doing it right then. Play the morning reversal with shares and collect premiums from the dumbasses who think it will tank or spike in a week by doing covered calls and puts. PLTR is literally such easy money.

All good points, but what catalyst would cause this to make big jump and be more just something with a stable price that isn't going to drop? Holding value is one thing but open calls need real movement if we're talking about the shorter term ones as you have some Jan 21 and even some 12/31s.

Oh no you gotta call all 3 credit agencies and tell them you have a pending issue that you wish to resolve.

The real question now is : can a chinese multi-national relocate and give the finger to the CCP?

With most of the products sold coming from China it is improbable, but without relocating it's HQ BABA will always be very undervalued because of political risk.

all hail Xi Jinping. no one in the US has the balls to do what he did. Big tech is too powerful lets be honest. I gained alot of respect for him srs.
You know, there's stupid and then there's really, fucking stupid. It should be obvious that you cannot front run an economic recovery in the commodity space. Because if a bunch of boneheads bid up prices of key commodities like steel or oil, then the recovery never happens and demand stays depressed. Sell that shit and move on.

Not the best day 🤔
But they just can't make them disappear out of thin air same as they can do to a person with a net worth not in the billions of dollars. This would also present Xi in a very very very bad way. People like Ray Dalio would also probably back off intensely if the party made Jack Ma disappear, and Ray is a good friend of the party as far as I know.

Liquidated my position for ~30% loss. Taking the rest of the year off. Could be worse right?
Depends on how much money you made. If you can afford to spend 500-1000 on a quality cpa, do that because they can potentially save you taxes in ways you never imagined.
Well fuck me then

Pretty clear that it was a successful attempt to unload bags. I got out with huge profit due to all the pump here. Looking to get back in soon. Careful with all the pump threads you see here - real easy to see what OP is trying to do.

4) Fake Honey

I watched a doc about how they have a whole science lab just to test if honey is real or fake made from corn syrup in Germany. And apparently Xi, aka Winnie Da Poo eats soo much honey, China has to pump out fake honey to the rest of the world like it’s no tomorrow trying to pass it off as real. 

Fuck you Winnie Da Poo! I see you! 👀

Woke up just in-time for ATH half an hour ago. Happy holidays, retards!  🚀
Yea you’re right.. China is going to hurt itself by bringing down one of its biggest companies.. makes sense. This is all politics and will eventually blow over. As usual this is overselling on fear. Revenue isn’t going anywhere, the company isn’t going anywhere. This is about as strong a buy that’s out there. Just don’t play short term.
You gotta play both sides for max trendies 🚀🚀😎👨‍🚀

My SBE calls have been crushing it this week. Have calls for March and may. This will run hard when the merger with ChargePoint is complete before mid January. IMO ChargePoint will be the leader in EV charging, in tandem with the Tesla supercharger network. I say this as a Tesla owner. I just don’t think it’s on peoples radar like it will be once it’s ChargePoint and not SBE after merging. Buy the picks and shovels, not the gold!

 RemindMe! 10days
Nobody really wants to authorize a trillion plus USD debt package right now when a new admin is coming to power in a month, it’s all bluster.

You’ll see back and forth and then a week after we have President Biden we’ll get (more or less) the same package President Trump nixed.

None of these people actually feel any of the pain that any American who is in the bottom 95% has felt this last year, all they’re worried about is optics: Republicans have to look like they fought hard to only do what was needed to keep the economy from dying, the Democrats have to look like they’re doing all they can to make the world a better place.  The more pain the people feel the more each party can tell their base “I fought for you, but the other side made this as awful as they could”.

Both parties are ass.
I hope you sold man
I'm getting assblasted by ebay, damn

When they had that market cap the EPS was 3 and now it's -4. Is Cohen's mom going to buy 100M PS5s?
Honestly, I'm thinking about taking some off the table. This Tidal acquisition sounds dumb af to me and looks like they have more money than ideas. They should be spending time building products and markets that actually fit their core offering.

The actress ended up paying a 100+M USD fine. Putin put an oligarch in a cage when he went against him. There is this Chinese billionaire in exile in New York City making quite some noise. Say what you want about these authoritarian countries, they don’t let money and influence rule everything when the top dogs are concerned.
I think you might be a little too optimistic on this. Financials < CCP. 

A great case study would be Tencent. Again one of the largest companies but pinned in the past as out of control youth gaming did not fit into the narrative.
Way overvalued in comparison

I thought the lockup period didn't end until March?
no
You'd be up by ~48% if you bought everything equally
Congrats everyone who held. Truly remarkable
While I think you will be alright since they will go back up. I dont think CANOO has any rocket fuel. 

They dont have a working commercial model meaning still premanufacturing + subscription model meaning they will spend tons on marketing and customer acquisition cost.

HOWEVER, once established, subscription is much more stable revenue so maybe rocket then

Dump Truck Hour you mean
You’re right, if Baba falls, wish and pinduoduo can be the new kings of e-commerce
Americans are racist who would have thunk
Totally agree. I’ll be out if we see an actual short squeeze. Unless of course they pivot to something promising (e.g., eSports) and not filling stores with  figurines. But I imagine about two years from now there will be a ton of RH investors bagholding this as it dwindles back under $5.

It just goes down by $5 for every $100 you make above the $70k (single) threshold. The threshold is higher if you're married or have kids.

Buy dip for shares

got downgraded for being over valued
ARKK is down 2%. thats extremely v olatile for an ETF. and tesla is up for the day.

the next rug pull ARKK is taking a 10% haircut

Not as exciting as other plays.. but WMT is set up nicely for a run up.
What % of all this do you think is already priced in the stock? Hard for me to wrap my head around the fact that not a lot of the market hasn't realized this yet.
Poor Burry. Does not understand how the market works. Call me Burry maybe ill explain it to you.
Literally everything red except almost GME. What a stupid day
Buy the AI dip

To be fair, he said AT Wendy's, not behind Wendy's.

hope you bought the dip
Look at BLNK. That was riding around the 20-30 range for a while and then broke out and within a week it hit 52 where its at now.
It hit 211 institutions shift to buy
Why EOD?

Jesus. Even MGNI is taking a day off.
Of course it's still massively down. We haven't recovered yet and we're far from it. That's why you can still buy airlines at 50% off pre-covid levels. The idea is to buy low and then sell high, remember?
I’m not even into Chinese stocks, just don’t know why this became so tempting all of a sluten 🤌

I’ve recently learned how quick you can gain and loose. This might be an addiction....
Not really given they are a newly merged company A lot of the high growth assets are either new IE Pluto or new for major growth shifts IE showtime and CBS. I expect the streaming news will be significant and it will drive the stock higher. My comparison is to the 2019 investor day when we first got a real picture of the Disney streaming story. My trade is in part based on expectations being much lower than Disney and they over delivering in a big way. I think the upside could be greater than a 10-15% move post investor day. Also betting on a run up to investor day as we get more info but I like how they are doing new Star Trek and building on the franchises they own. I see the streaming wars going 1 DIS 2 VIAC and that’s a big part of the trade the street will just realize this on or even a few days after investor day 2021.
real talk the smart play is to not play BABA at all. too news driven.
No BABA?
$BORK
Lol maybe 100. Not 90
Market closes early today.
Thinking about buying this SQ dip. Would i be fuk?
366 or lower at close
Good idea. Might want to roll out further though.
The upside is probably gonna be 17/18 pre merger and the downside could be 14.50, so you might get another window If they take forever for merger

I agree or making an adapter like comma.ai

Looking at BABA dragging down my portfolio...

“Alexa play Not Afraid by Eminem”
Naturally I sell my 0dte tesla calls for a little bit of profit and it goes back up $5 two minutes after I sell. 🙄
Why would there be an IV crush Monday..
When the only green things in my portfolio are SPY and QQQ... what
You mean 0 to infinity
Only reason it hasn’t is TSLA lol
Wouldn't you first have to have a competitive market for antitrust to be relevant lol
It feels random because no one talks about them. Look at their financials and the value. Do you want an unproven technology doing surgery on your guts — or the leader?  There are only a few winners in this space.
Per month?
Bought calls on the dips.  GME, NIO, PLTR, ARKG, VLDR
TSLA BABY🚀🚀🚀
fuck it dude why not im in lol
Reasons I hate China (in order of importance):

How is his wife holding up?
BABA was down only -8% in Hong Kong but it's fucking down -20% here in America.
Lmao
Haha yeah stock go down number get smaller
Awesome. I RSVP’ed.

*edit* thanks for the gold! May it turn into many 🚀’s
Via a short you invest money in the lending of shares in order to profit later. It fits at least one dictionary definition. 

My own understanding of the concept is slightly more sophisticated than that of the dictionary, but even then it would be possible for it to be an investment. For example, if you have stalked every employee of a given company and figured out each and every single one of them is a complete retard, you could short the company (assuming that at least one of their competitors isn't) and you would have made a trade that can't go tits up.
one word
Don’t worry when I get mine I’ll buy you a 4 for 4
not yet, IMO
Same I got just below 19
why do people insist on chinese stocks when we got all these delicious fucken US stocks at home
I'm in.
BABA rising.
have been waiting for this to happen. I hope it goes down to 90  so that I can buy some
SMART! If senate goes blue in a few weeks, this is a 5% gainer instantly
Exactly. Or passed out and woke up with a dick drawn on your face. You just opened up your account and feel like you should have one.
not 100 for a round lot? at least you'd be able to write covered calls against the position for a while. 

90 is like 🤡🔫
Wish I had a stimmy check to throw at it

Good for you. I’m sure you’ll be homeless again like the rest of us soon.
Hop on SSPK before  its too late valued at 400m but I'm smelling a multi billion buyout from a big cannabis player come 2021.

Check their revenue and profit.

It is a dog shit company
Everything is ON SALE RN
Next Friday is New Year 2021! time flies! 🍾🎉
Lol not at all, I’d do the same thing. If you look at charts, you can easily see best times/prices to buy in and easily see $1-$3 increase within a couple of weeks and make 100k-500k depending on the amount of shares you were able to buy.
Good time to buy ARKG
NP looks too good of an opportunity to pass up, barely ran yet too still early
yes. if the CCP wanted to destroy Alibaba they wouldn't draw it out. They'd just do it .

Yeah sadly only 1000 warrants @3.50ish. was trying to average down but waiting for a bottom and missed it 🤣. gotta hate/love that volatility.

I'm delighted to announce that I will be BTFD on CRSR
Wait 3 days before buying the dip on big news like this for an individual stock
At least China is actually doing something about its tech monopolies. Our anti-trust processes won't achieve anything
LIDAR...so hot right now

Long BABA and Short GME...you must really love the soup kitchens
Don't buy BABA options, the IV crush on Monday will rape you, violently.
Buy the dip you cowards
Fuck are you spying on me?
Wait at least 3 days imo to see cause this shit gonna keep dropping wr havent seen the bottom yet. And you gonna have to buy leaps to be safe too, these types of black swan events dont recovered immediately.
You say that, but nasdaq is even :p
Saved*
Selling puts on this is profitable if you sell around 26-27
Palantir took two days to reach that level of 29 and in the space of 15 minutes it lost it all, lolllll
And my cautious optimism turned out to be right.

As a rule of thumb, when you have retard rallies for 2 days straight, you can expect pull-back/correction/consolidation on the third, maybe fourth day. And that's what's happening today.

Shorts are bidding their time, longs are either out of ammo or conserving ammo, option volume cannot push the price on its own, so we are now in the standard GME stuckness period, which can go on for days... a lil bit up, a lil bit down, up, down, just bouncing...
Nice poem poetryboy

Absolutely an overreaction. What incentive does the CCP have in ruining their most prosperous company? This overreaction to political theater is a huge opportunity for anyone with cash right now.
Small caps? Maybe?
Of course 55-60% of people don't wanna pay their debts.
What does it mean when. “ If the Option order results in a short position through option assignment or exercise, a fee may be charged. The ability to generate or maintain a short position, through either exercise or assignment, may be restricted.”  Mean?
Wow I just looked at Baba lol... tbh this looks like a buying opportunity. Baba still the e-commerce king in China. This is just like when they bring in FANG for their quarterly media harassment. Always bounces back

He hasn't transitioned like Elon and Bezos yet. Those dudes were goofy looking then changed with piles of cash. Bezos when he founded Amazon looked like an average dad and now he looks like an MMA fighter.
Just buy and then average down but sub 100 for ARKG would be good.
Buying BABA right now on the dip “be greedy when others are fearful...”
Nah. They'll incur minor fines at worst. The ridiculously wealthy don't really play by the same rules.

This has huge implications in manufacturing. If the vaccine widely being used in China is not effective it could reasonably trigger a delay in opening after Chinese New Year.

They don’t care.  They all got paid a high salary, ample vacation, and top tier healthcare.  Even if they do “care” they will only fight if it doesn’t hurt them.

Mom & dad fighting over allowance amount.  Kiddo gets nothing.
Yes. Markets generally go down faster than they go up.  Go look at a chart of the SPY (S&P 500). There are always corrections. Buy quality stocks when others “feel” scared.  Commentators love to talk about how they feel about the market. Don’t care about good or bad feelings.  Healthy companies with little debt will continue to operate and innovate in market decline.  

Consider Microsoft as an example: A stock market decline has very little impact on Microsoft’s future with massive profit margins, tons of cash, boatloads of optionality as they ride a growing wave of cloud computing and digital tools. 

Yet you could have bought Microsoft in the mid-$100s in February / March 2020. Yeah, the recovery was somewhat unexpectedly quick. But, some idiots sold Microsoft in the mid-$100s. Others  bought the dip. Know the names that you want to get into and have the cash ready.  You likely won’t pick the bottom — that requires dumb luck — but a sale is a sale.  Then hold through the recovery and for the long term. Some companies like Microsoft need to get bigger.  They have to. They produce too much cash and therefore they must do ALL of the following: invest internally on long term R&D bets, invest internally on nimble short-term opportunities, buy more companies to grow revenue and profits, give capital back to shareholders with dividend increases, and buy back stock.   What else are they going to do? They are going to get bigger. Hopefully, if they continue to be smart and focused, the stock price will weigh them as more valuable.

At what point does someone minimize the “business” outlook and just recognize that it’s possible someone with money recognized an opportunity where the amount of money he can park in GME for a while will force the hands of those shorting. What’s the plan after that though? Everyone seems to think he wants to legit turn the company around for the long run but who knows. I think the only thing that’s clear is someone is going to get caught with their pants down.     I don’t think the hype is unfounded necessarily. I just don’t think there is going g to be a resurrection of The store like people are arguing about here.

Everything in my portfolio green, except PLTR! My paid Technical Analysis experts on YouTube promised me PLTR would be at 40 today! FML
Word
Anyone else think this baba dip was a tad exaggerated
Oh yeah you’re fine lol
Too gay for me, not feeling the festive atmosphere of fuck with fckn, for those reasons I'm out. You still got 2 sharks.
Love my brkb shares to hedge against my dumb as fuck options plays such as leap snap puts at a strike of $5
Xi swung his cock and balls
But the share price is down 1% today after going up near 40% in a week, isn't this time to sell? /s
can't dip fries in the oil at the same damn time
Marvel gonna catch up to amd
anti trust on baba
Ok WSB just bought 12/31 BABA 250c... 🙏🙏🙏🙏 pleas tell me I’ll fly again
If this is something that should happen in the next few weeks shouldn’t i wait for it to sell off again before I buy in?
[deleted]
Is there a way to find out what Ark is doing with BABA EOD?
Tempting but ive seen this movie before, i know how it ends. Waiting a week
You won’t
He's a degenerate commie
CRM calls 90mte
For sure I’m definitely not planning on holding until April and June, just enough to get some money back on a bounce then get out. I don’t trust this long term at all 😂
Don’t they own like 10% of the market cap in their holdings right now
They’re both autistic
Local top? 🙏
Wondering if I have to buy using someone else’s account to trick the market into going up
Ok, I didn't get it :)
The "!!” were excessive
I feel your pain. I'm heavily invested in NIO and thought I was buying another dip today but it just keeps going down.
Tsla 0tde puts so tempting. If this shit drops 2% it’s a 10bagger
but you have to use paper anyway to dry off your wet asshole
Nose diving - **down less than 2%**
Oh no :( its a dead company now
Lol for real. I’m still bag holding tons of stuff. Capital all tied up. May have to do some Xmas triage
I bought BABA at $305. I don't feel anything anymore
You wanna trade on Xmas eve bro? I like early close.  Speeds the day up
Things will be fine by Monday... chill. End of year sell off. Every company is taking losses on stock price right now. Even profitable ones.
Great thanks!

Someone said that it was suspicious you were pumping steel with such detailed DD--only thing is, it's not you simply speculating, as there's concrete information on the rising prices! Keep it up!

Facts

Maybe next week. $29 looks like a stretch as of right now.
CCP antitrust is way different beast than EU/US antitrust.
You asked for a red dildo you got a red dildo
Just loaded up on GME 1/15 $30 calls
R.I.P your taste in whiskey.
2021 Year of the Chinese flexing their tech companies.
The amount of starving people I could have fed for the holidays with all the money I just pissed away is astounding 🤮
Bought these at today’s current lowest so I’m hoping for the best
Yo fuck Christmas man I wanted presents today
Decided I wasn’t going to buy anything today - ended up buying loads.
PLTR is just a big disappointment today... My calls are slowly bleeding to $0
Sorry to tell you this,  but these breakup valuation wins might work in the western world but definitely not in China.
GME just playing with us right now, it will start to moon towards the end of trading hours
Same here. I didn't go in with much so I am not too worried
I feel like I'm playing Texas Hold 'Em and waiting on the sole river card that can save my ass.


Except that card is PLTR and it's not happening.
Whoa that's advanced
STOP THE COUNT
Still up 9% in a week
Baba calls could be the fucking play... or not 😬
Everywhere I look in my portfolio I see red. Even these boomer T shares I don't remember buying are bleeding. And yet SPY is still green. 

Perhaps I'm not very good at this.

Damn I finally was able to day trade for the first time yesterday (got 25k in my Robin Hood account) RIP that dream bois down bigly
1pm I believe
So democrats wanted to boost payments, Repubs said no. Then Republicans wanted to cut the foreign aid, Dems said no. Which side am i supposed to hate more??
China and XI monopoly
Means it’s almost time to moon
I'm pretty new to this but every holiday week has had a selloff.
CRSR dragging my mood on Christmas Eve. At least I got out of most of my position on that last spike. CRSR your mom still a ho though.
More like no news right now so people are randomly dumping. Just sit back and relax
Buying PLTR right now makes a lot of sense. Its being pinned below 28 for today's options expiration. It'll likely jump next week once that pin is done.

It doesn't protect against it as much as selling the opposite side, but your short leg will lose value to IV crush at a higher rate than your long leg. 

I'd sell put credits personally here, though.
The only one giving people a santa rally.
I think this also has to do with the questioning of the Chinese vaccine sinovac and the approach of CNY. If the vaccine is not effecting manufacturing after CNY is fucked. I work in manufacturing and am rushing all of my shipments out prior to CNY.
Damn Palantir really gave me the shaft today
Monday? Lmao we aren’t getting it, 100%
Ok.  Just ordered 2700 shares and 200 C14.50 12/31 Let's go full retard. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
What the fuck are you talking about?
Oh shit okay I thought you were talking  about another stay at home order. Yeah I wouldn't be surprised
Why do you have to put it in bold? 

It’s profit taking before EOY. It’s not the end of the world. Go back to bed grandpa.
GL.. PLTR raped me today but you might be good. Probably heading back to 26 area before things take off. I’ll be back in with you soon..
I bought shares at 304$, 10 minutes before the antitrust accusations came out. Fml
10 am pst
What happen to baba btw?
You are a retard, if the institutions didn’t collapse when every single stock and bond was going down 10% a day they aren’t collapsing over knockoff Chinese Amazon going down 15 in a day
How is this different from the already established Chewy?
big sad
Final boarding call for the BABA 🚀🚀🚀
Fucking HYLN just wiped out all of this week's gains.
With 50k capital you could easily stack 3% gains monthly just by selling options - Cash Secured Puts and Covered Calls.

My favorite strategy this year has been buying companies that have a ton of potential (PLTR, MP, MAXR are my big winners), with high IV, and selling CC's on them until they get called away. Up 50% this year (I know this is nothing for you degens but it adds up), mainly using r/thetagang strat's.
I sold my Tesla at 640 two days ago to buy ARKG at the top AMA
Well its about time then bc GE hasnt been the play in years
You do not need to cover your position today if you have been a good kid.
have to actually get shit done at work in the last hour here. merry christmas/happy chanukah to all and see you fucks next week!
Owning a few long dated calls is the only $2000 stimulus anyone is getting.

nice!

This is the strongest GME performance it's had this year,  it typically gives up a ton of its gains after a crazy day. Encouraging for bull in the short term
buy the ai dip?
Know the word: Bubble.
Yeah, but they do market orders and can sell way below actual value, so I can't imagine anything that wouldn't sell at 3:50 if it was ITM. That's legit free money for MMs.
No
wait till eod.
None, we’re just waiting for DA and it rocketed way too much yesterday. Should be $13-14 right now, not $17.

Sold out of PRPL nice gain last couple of months. bought more CRSR 

People selling CRSR right now are mad
#ARKK FUCKING NOSEDIVING, IS THIS THE END OF THE BULL RUN?
Don’t catch a falling knife
What’s with all the people talking about a stock but refusing to say which one lately?
👽
Dip buy
I truly believe 90% of the people in here are genuinely retarded. You guys have to be with how irresponsible you all are. Hopping on the FOMO train inflating the price of so many unprofitable meme stocks. Yolo'ing entire portfolios. And then to act with disbelief when you blow up your entire account. Jesus....  
  
This shit sure is entertaining though. Especially when the stupid plays end up working out. Merry Christmas you stupid motherfuckers. 🎅🎄
Plan is to lock in profits on overvalued meme stonks to buy more baba if it dips
Buy the dip f****t!!
Time to buy
techincals never mattered. did technicals predict jack ma will get absolutely raped by Xi? Nope. if you had technical coloured crayons for BABA it was a solid straight up rocket. Fuck crayons.
[removed]
What re the requirements to receive the proposed 2k stimulus?
Good for you my man...the BIG lesson here is to never ever give up. Good luck to all in 2021. And Yeah, Merry Christmas 🎅 🎄
Profits before new year.

I think all the stocks that have had large runups are being sold off in high volumes.

I didn't get the memo unfortunately.
[deleted]
Basically, she’s saying dont overreact. Situation is not going to be worst case scenario the way people are reacting. It will be resolved with some new rule that will foster growth and competition for smaller players (which China’s been trying to do anyway for the past few years). BABA, TEN and other big players will continue their path to greatness because China wants their own Apple, Google, MSFT in the world stage
Via con Dios!!!
Everything selling off because people want money for Christmas. Anyways, nice buying opportunity for y’all
You forgot the other news that came out. CCP has been using baba and other private tech companies in china to help them analyze stolen data from US companies and government. We have no idea what the repercussions will be from that as well.
Looks like I’m dumping money into pltr
Palantears 😢
Hopefully it does, if not no worries.
Fuck yea. Except I have 2/19 $31 calls LOL a little to ambitious hahaha
probably some institutions trying to get out before year close. they have almost all the float.
i thought she bought baidu, not baba.

Anyways wtf the only green in my portfolio was ark and now that's down too
Depends can you suck on the way in and out? Can you suck two at once? What if it was tip to tip and on each stroke out you were technically down stroking the other? Middle out!
This is where we excel
Same bro, chasing pennies here...
Looks like a red Christmas for me
I'm giving it a few more days to deal with the shock of this drop.  I'm betting that the news and the market reaction will scare off a few more longs.  But overall, yeah, I agree, this will bounce back.
Next week
We wish you a Merry Christmas and No Money Next Year...

I’m long BABA too. I ain’t worried. Worse case they break them up and it’ll be worth more when the individual enterprises are spun off and allowed to flourish unhindered under leadership thats singularly focused on growing that business.
This is it. Baba bottom is in.
NVTA having a bad day, lot of their smaller holdings too
baba dumping 17% when in hk it was only down 8%. defnitely unexpected.
And some say their gains grew three sizes that day.  But very un-fucking-likely.
Ruined mine too fuck them
Ok campers, who crashed my stock by buying a call? Not coooool dudes.

The only upside of the dumb trades I made today, nothing really turned around so I feel like the dick only slapped me across the face once. It didnt come back around and plus the mushroom stamp.
Well what happened today is expected right?? Or am I completely retarded and should pull out cause it made since that if it had a day like that next day would be particularly good aswell
Yeah I'm just waiting.  Keeping money available to jump on it hopefully before it moons.

Yeah maybe don’t buy the baba dip. We are coming up on CNY and could absolutely see an extended CNY is the vaccine they are using is not effective enough.
You’re totally right, I was just concerned I’d be hit with a rug pull and forced to diamond hands all weekend so I sold out. What this proves yet again is that buying cloudflare calls on its dip days is the move basically every time.

There's buying the dip and there's fucking with the Chinese government.

No way we have a red Christmas right???
On another note. So where the *fuck* are those shorts that are supposedly forced to cover today?
BABA can’t go lower than 0% YOY, right? right? guys?
Thcb news?
BUY MORE VLDR
So for the better part of the year, fundamentals haven’t mattered, now technicals don’t matter.  Boys, we’re trading on pure retardation now!

Thank you gme and nio! Merry Christmas
There it is like clockwork dip is bought. Do bulls not want proper prices?
If this is a sell off I can't wait for the bull run.
What dip did you buy?
So people selling China stocks because of Xi and jack ma having problems? Yea that’s a logical way to trade lmfao. Every company including baba sucks Xi’s dick. Baba shouldn’t even be overselling because jack nana being in trouble doesn’t mean shit for the companies getting oversold. Y’all are all just really that stupid aren’t you lol?
As long as 99% isn't unemployed yet, we in tech still have work to do. 

Oops, did I just say that out loud? Oh, well.
Just got off the phone with a BABA investor.

Their initial findings suggest that the earth's core is made from nacho cheese. More to come soon as the dip continues.
LOL at you thinking it’s something that’ll happen in his lifetime.  I’ve seen Elysium,  have you?  You think that’s possible in any of our lifetimes?

2,000 stimulus will pass. Monster rally on Monday. Get ready 👀

Just a dip, it always rises bb
I don't trust people who don't know the difference between "you're" and "your".
Just lost 40% of my whole account; that was not very tight butthole.
What makes you say that
Maybe buying to close?
I tried to jump on this and pre market activity screwed me. Bought as fast as I could ton open today and came in at 19. 

Now I'm down.  How do you not get ripped off by pre market run up. Who are these people buying pre market? How do you buy pre market?
Who the fuvk cares. At this point it’s moot until they sign the papers.
QQQJ leaps are free money
That’s all my savings bro. I ain’t no millionaire like y’all
How do people get out of cheap covered calls when on Margin?

Putting new cash in doesn't let you buy options right away until it clears. Then it will probably just reduce margin than give you funds to buy out that option.

It sucks being stuck in a 100 share position that only costs under $50 (with profit) to release.

Is it hard to get Naked options clearance from TDA?
[deleted]
Tsla looking like that struggle tree in Charles brown in my account right now
They had their anchor from Asia on and she stated that even China’s own state media is trying to bring calm to this situation, that this is because Jack Ma went too far with his criticism of regulation and the regulators are just trying to foster competition and growth for smaller companies. This is in no way to break up BABA or cripple their business because China wants a big player in the world market the way US has Apple, MSFT, Google, etc
April Mt calls taking a dump...time to eat them up

One of the worst days all my stocks drilling they ruined Christmas 🤢😡
BABA racing to green boys!!
I agree with you here. There is some phenomenal DD around here regarding a potential takeover too and I’m inclined to think that is much more likely than him pulling out.

I think there will be some sort of reality check that brings some of these valuations down a little in the next year. If they stumble their way through some improvements and valuations drop a bit I still think there is room to move up a little from here, and a lot of room to move with better execution.

I bought 10 shares at $212. 10 more and I can sell a CC !!
Would have to get back over 218 for safety.
FCEL isn't even a battery stock?
I've got February 19th. Am I good?
Yes
Don't bother, TA has about as much predictive power as tossing darts at a newspaper. It only works for this guy because he's randomly longing tech stocks during a bubble, but simply buying ETFs would've outperformed him hard.

It's am easy way to turn investing into a spectator sport though 🙆‍♂️

Give it time.  It's got real industry presence with the Hyundai/Kia deals.  Boomer stonk, but will go up

Yeah, I've been there. 

PLTR is trading in a very predictable way atm. Which is why I'm selling options on it while slowly buying more shares. 

The charts are showing a breakout mid Jan. But I could see positive news sparking more intrest. 

But, I could be wrong and get fucked. It's been working for a month now.
I’m thinking I’m gunna need to get in. It’s unbelievable. The antitrust China shit. Doubt anything would happen but who knows

BUY BABA

BABA is the CCP. It’s a joke to think they would actually punish the company severely.
There we go SPY flat again.

I did not time it right and only found the first bottom
People in here legitimately think the squeeze is scheduled like an earnings call. Bananas
Damn. I have got to get better at this. Here I am, thinking I’m Responsible for choosing an expiration a few months out. Before I know it, I’m still waiting to turn a profit and expiration is only a few weeks away. Fuck.

You have won the Ass Hamster seal of approval.  *Ass Hamsters:  You know you want one.*
Where's the dipshit that has been pushing a pennystock with a ticker similarly close to PTON (take out the O). It's down almost 20% today.

(I know his username, it's u/x2Arawnage, I just want him publicly shamed and banned)
CCP buying shares now
Anyone that's bitchin about GME right now clearly hasn't held this very long. MMs have a lot of ammo, and REG SHO hasn't really played out in the past.

Oct 8th's giant pump was because of the MSFT partnership news. It likely has nothing to do with the fact that it was on REG SHO for 13 days.

Just diamond hands this thing and tendies will rain soon enough. Shares and April calls.

Yeah the chart is OK under 3. The issue is it’s owned by a bunch of reckless, insolvent crooks. So you can hope to trim it at 6, or double down a 2, 1, delisting.

If you’re feeling down on yourself or unappreciated, know that markets are inefficient. Be grateful for the people in your life who are there for you, and fade those that aren’t. Keep working towards whatever it is you’re doing and when the day comes when you shred “earnings estimates” watch as all of a sudden everyone wants to be associated with you and your stock price goes to the moon. Your intrinsic value is hung like Hulk. Keep at it. Merry Christmas

Wtf is going on with baba?  All that volume and it's going down?  Tf?
Agreed , but im holding my calls until they crash. I'm not falling for this.
I appreciate the wisdom. This might get burried in replies but. I finally dug my self out of debt and I wanted all knowledge on investing. I though wsb was for legit advice, but it’s tendies and memes. So all advice is greatly appreciated
How did I start today so green and end up here?
Of course 😈
Can't believe so many people are missing out on 🧹⚡
Don't catch a falling knife.

Today isn't the day to buy $BABA.
With unbreakable glass just like the cybertruck...oh wait
I understand why brokers sell ITM options on expiration day if you can't cover.

I don't really understand why they do it like an hour before close rather than like 10 mins before close, tho
Played it way too safe w/ PLTR 29.50 CCs, should have sold fuckin 28.00s

Baba has been the closest Chinese company resembling a western company possibly ever. 

I guess china had enough of their coddling up to the west bullshit and not going by the CCP demands.

Don't invest in China ever. Looking at you, NIO bulls

It's in a range, and will likely tap the lower bounds before heading higher.  For me, if it taps lower and starts to bounce up, I'll add.  I opened a partial position a few days ago.

Shouldn’t all Chinese stocks be plummeting? This shows the government hates growth and will come after them next. NIO, and other companies are all connected to the big ones like Tenecet, BABA and Ant group.
I shorted it near 22 tho so I'm up nearly 20%
Imagine trusting China 😂
Where you think it’s headed price wise?
Up up up
Which brokers allow algo trading? Do some forbid it?

Yes

Been trading for a few years and rarely shaken up by some of the big moves but I gotta say... this BABA action pretty unreal
Going to buy SQ because it’s low. That’s my TA.
I’m so glad the market closes in an hour and a half so I don’t have to lose anymore money
Fuck no I ain’t selling either.

Ahh the retards that fomo buy the top then cry when it starts to dip some and paper hand panic sell for a loss all while blaming us for their idiotic decisions.
Buy shares on this play, hold shares till if we squeeze or till Q4 earnings. Most of us retards have figured this out, why can’t you?

Never actually played BABA before so that’ll be interesting
Another reason I moved the fuck out at 18
It seems most stocks today are fucked. It’s just a Christmas week sell off. Only stock in my portfolio positive just barely is apple
Yeah. I bought these BABA shares for Christmas. They don’t fit. Can I get a refund?
No way. Even if it is, the juice is not worth the squeeze.
I don't even get it man... I think they just have a hate boner🤡🤡🤡
Dw brother!!! Everything is red rn. Next week we get tendies
If you don’t buy baba right now I promise your missing out
Can somebody tell me I’ll be alright with my GOEV bags please ? 🥺
Not buying a stock which has already rallied up. That's a fools game.
Small brains not realizing that reverse mortgage my liver means I donate my liver when I die. Lmfao

pfff TESLA to 2k by 2023
He started with a very modest amount of money and made it into his fortune. Not his fault people follow him. I don’t really think he is a pumper. Take his positions with a grain of salt.
Gg, now take out 80k and invest it reasonably lmao
Does this apply to BABA?
xi is probably lowkey the richest man in the world brah. doubt he needs th emoney.

it’s worth it to keep trying options because someone also made $100k in 3 mins

Went cash monday except TSLA. Really liking these pullbacks. You know top performing wallstreet chads dont have to trade on Christmas. They got their bonuses in the bag.
BABA makes $. $ wins in the end. I think this is more lip service to look powerful. The government loves BABA's success, they don't want to ruin it.
This is the worst fucking green day I’ve seen in a while
yo tell me when its time to buy icln and ark leaps on the dip
A lot of people missed out on the TSLA rocket early this year. Maybe some of those people learned lessons (especially those who FOMO'd)? Call it early positioning? Buy the rumor early? Everything gets pumped here in WSB.
Buy the dip!

Looking at the screen like Clark griswald..  Guess I'll return those presents now

Oh my average right now is 14.56 or something. I don't mind averaging up to 16 or so

No problem, get out before the next leg up, though. 😊
“The COVID-19 vaccine developed by China's Sinovac has an efficacy that clears the 50% level needed for approving emergency use in Brazil, according to a biological research institute in Sao Paulo state.

Sinovac has asked Brazil not to disclose the full results of trials of the so-called Coronavac for 15 days, according to the Instituto Butantan, which is overseeing the trials.

The Brazilian newspaper Folha de S. Paulo earlier reported the Coronavac had shown an efficacy greater than 50% in stage-three trials.”

[source](https://asia.nikkei.com/Spotlight/Coronavirus/Coronavirus-Free-to-read/Coronavirus-latest-China-and-Indonesia-ban-travel-from-UK) 

"I'm worried that perhaps the efficacy rate is not so high after all," Dias said.

[source](https://www.google.com/amp/s/thehill.com/homenews/news/531567-chinese-vaccine-test-results-delayed%3famp) 

I read about a plant where 50 people were covid positive after getting the Sinovac vaccine. Not looking good for this one...
its not down even 1.5% lol
Hope you're right. Holding on hope for GME in 2021
You’d double your money selling $1 water bottle at bachelor parties faster than with Tesla at this point.
Most likely just getting hit cuz of BABA, china sell off
🎵I'm dreaming of a green Christmas🎵
Weeklies puts good idea
Worthless showing without account value
Boutta return some Christmas gifts.
The price I think it's going to hit is actually a tad below 210 but whatever, if it doesn't hit then oh well. Not putting a big amount into it anyway.
You guys have shares right? You haven't lost anything until you sell. "Boohoo, im impatient and bought after a 28% run up in a week." I bought in at 16, and the following week it dropped down to 12. Also its a fucking holiday, retail traders are out doing anything but trading today. Hold the line, shut the fuck up, and wait. This stock is the most hated ticker on Wall Street of course youre going to have some ups and downs. Hold on to your purse, you nancy. We are still going up to 25-30 before EOY and after jan, anywhere from 35-40 without a squeeze
☠🐱📈📉
Gut feel Monday gonna be a ripper
I'm loading up on BABA expecting a bounce on Monday. Wish me luck boys.

I sold TSLA for ARKG yesterday 🤡🤡🤡
Can’t believe the $BABA calls I bought at open are still up 10% somehow 😂
I think I’m immune to the beer flu. I accidentally coughed on a couple of workers 2 weeks ago and they’re still coming to work. Nothing to worry about.

Options trade in increments of 5 cents on a penny. If the option value is below the smallest trading price it is effectively worthless.
So many dips today can’t even decide which one to buy.

Worth looking into
F I I I
It’s a victim of its own success at this point.

The amount of money in near term options literally went up over 10x this week and (surprise) most of that is in calls.  I’m now a conspiracy theorist but I absolutely believe people writing calls to make money will do whatever they can to keep options from being too painful on them and would sell shares to cause a bit of panic, might not work on a trillion dollar company but when you’re talking a few billy I believe they have influence.

Or I dunno maybe being up 50% in a week it’s not uncommon to have a red day here and there.

Regardless I’m not fucking leaving.
How’s it gonna spread when borders are closed from the US. The new covid is just fear mongering and who cares the europoors can dump all they want. That’s all they do anyways
Seriously, what is even your plan. We still have six days for the shorts to be covered, like did you really expect a moon on a half day christmas eve? Stop bitching out and hold fast
CCP and Premier Xi to BABA holders.............. He steps in the single door. Gets his ass whipped with 20 lashes, like that dude up in Singapore.

Why would anyone buy options if they weren't expecting a short term bounce
As a software engineer I still don't know what EXACTLY they are trying to do. This sounds like the marketing talks for folks who don't need to know. Oh well, wtf should I care about that? Moon it is.
What do you mean?
[deleted]
Looks like nobody has any orders in to buy.

If nobody is buying and someone lists one for sale at .2 the price will show like that is the price when really the price is 0 because no one has an order to buy at any price
Or a great chance to load up?
Are chinese stocks a systemic risk for the rest of the market?
I sold the top this morning should’ve bought back in at 17. Good luck.
My buddy's pulling out $16k from his 401k to double his investment in $GME first week of the new year. I've only got 400 shares and trying to buy $420.69 calls but Fidelity won't let me 🤷

Wow.

What is an option?

How does a contract work?

Who buys an option contract when it is sold?

If no one in the entire world wants to buy your options contract, those must be some dumb plays you've made.


You should not be here.  Leave before you lose more money
How can we keep this shit secret?
So many newbies in here who don’t realize when an Xmas sell off is this bad the post Xmas/January bull run is really awesome. I wouldn’t sell, but you can if you want someone’s going to buy the dip and everything will gap up so it don’t matter

PLTR: When the Dip Keeps on Dipping

A Christmas Story
Christmas ruined
Cnk looks decent but is overpriced by comparison imo.

AMC now is like when CNK was $8, I assume that's when you bought in.

The big difference is AMC is at rock bottom, and has a history for being much more volatile, which means you'll probably be able to cash out sooner on it than CNK
Oh another dip to be bought up 🙄
Blood red for me today. See you guys on Monday. Im out
BABA is on the rebound!
guh

Bought BABA dip from 280 all the way down, is this what Alibaba intelligence feels like?
Someone turn on the 🖨️
No. Today 1 million shorts had to cover. We are at 4 million volume. Rest of the day is red and if we are lucky back to flat EOD.
ha. deepfuckingvalue was down 30k when he first entered the trade. he is now almost at 4mil, you fucktard
Me tio
might be a good day to play the sin wave...you should be up a decent amount rn. maybe sell and wait for it to drop again, then buy back.
Im feeling unwell
Baba fucking up my jd profits today.
Must have bought at the tippity top yesterday FOMO is a bitch
What if they are dated for april and beyond and up 70%?
My experience with DD like this is that it's almost never right. Why? Because you have to be a MM or at a high level in the SEC or maybe a securities lawyer with decades of experience to *really* understand this stuff.

Also, I don't believe in EMH but I DO believe that traders will look for obvious advantages like this and trade away any advantage you might get from it. Meaning stuff like this probably is priced in.
Are you feeling it now Mr. Krabs?
Este es el camino.
I really want some NKLA puts but I keep thinking it'll tread water for all of 2021. No strikes look appealing.
I speak with zero authority or special knowledge but I would be watching any Chinese company closely.

The market requires respect for private property and China laughs and laughs and laughs at the concept.
That's a good idea. We'll see what happens. Zm has retarded strength potential so I wouldnt be surprised if it moons for no reason

Big rebound on BABA now, get in now retards
Just bought more THC🐝 warrants
Thcb from +5 to -5 😑
Ok, I thought you knew for sure that he dumped it.
To be fair, after a quick +20% in a day would make sense
You're not allowed to sell or Huawei AI marks you with a red frowny face
So China is dead set on destroying its most valuable asset to challenge the big four in the the West. Smart
my guy doesnt understand options or IV crush
I wish I knew how to do code or whatever the hell python is. I guess I'll just have to stick to making wild guesses and 20% gains through sheer stupid luck
lol shorting GME yesterday was the freest money of the week.

sorry bulls

 It's still not enough.
I'm still up big on it. If it being down 1% is enough for you to be down big, then you're doing something wrong.
Look at the chart, what do you think?

Comparing them now is absurd but it’s also absurd to think SpaceX will be the only game in town.  Bezos has deep pockets.  It’s not hard to entice people from SpaceX with stock options or more money to jump rocket ships.

Lol this retard thinks the market cap of AZN is 128 million
I know it’s retarded to theorize anything on BABA at this point but someone answer me this: BABA was -8% down in Hong Kong and now we’re down double that amount(and counting). If the CCP is truly this child eating monster shouldn’t the natives have sold the fuck out?

Anything Chinese I don't really trust, I consider it high risk. The government has too much control. Some shit out of left field and all of a sudden the company is illegal to own or something crazy.

I actually predicted the very top of the September crash and bought weekly puts, and it was only like a 3-bagger. Any other stock would've been like a 20 bagger.

For real. Politics has become so insanely partisan from the last decade or two. Remember in the history books when they actually worked together and collaborated? God it's so awful.

Yeah. I feel like some 1dte spy calls are the way to go even if stimmy and spending goes south. Fitute trades will buy anything, and not buying anything Friday and all weekend will have them acting like a heroin addict for their next fix Sunday night.

China basically released another wave of COVID onto BABA.
Those puts ran bigly though
Anyone going cash gang? Or is this just a shitty red day?
The G*a*ME play is easily a minimum one month hold to four months, I wouldn't worry about a near future dip.  There has been plenty of well written DD, including rocket emojis, that have all basically indicated it's not a short term (one week) play.

Just my two cents on margin.

It’s so disappointing. I’ve lost 6k this year. I have to figure out a way to inverse my myself. So tired of this stair step to the bottom...
Bought in today for some calls. You fell prey to the typical sell off after merger. Most SPACs sell off for a bit right after merger then bounce back(if it's a good one) so you should ride it up, take profits right before merger then find an entry after merger so theta isn't touching you at night. There are some cases where they don't sell off after merger but it's very rare.
Right there with you my fellow *investor*.
was just thinking about buying puts on BABA..just wanted to wait an hour now its gone!
If you have to keep track of day trades, then you are poor.

Alibaba intrlligence!
STOP THE COUNT
Anyone lose big on BABA?
Raise your hand if NIO is hurting you rn
dude its down 1% on the day. how did you manage to lose money.
It is clear that the greatest risk to GME Moon Mission is the weak hands who panic over a 1.3% down day after +25% ... this is a buy and hold type of play
Nobody wants to sell
You see the interview with Elon Musk and Jack Ma?  TSLA should be multiples higher than BABA.  Only a fool would not sell BABA stock after watching that interview.  Jack MA is a moron.
CCP just wants to flex their power, they know better than to completely upend a major domestic retailer like that.

But yeah, Chinese stocks are always inherently a gamble for the reasons you mentioned.
Thia is the market we are living in.
AMZN at its pinch point
So when you sell a call and buy a call at different dates but at the same strike that's called a calendar spread, read more about those. Understand where the profit comes from (theta burn of sold call) and how IV can impact your position. The strike you sell can be at a higher call than the one you hold (now it's a diagonal spread). The call you bought in both situations works as collateral, so if the call you sold hits, your leap would be sold as collateral but you still get to keep the premium on the call you sold.

Can't tell ya what strike, that will be dictated by your risk tolerance and how much cash you've got.
FCEL bros it's time to buy the dip 🤑
It was up 50% hahahahaha

Sure, in time.

But right now that knife is falling and you're more likely to catch the blade than the handle.

I'm going to steal another Redditor's comment and say that how China handles this says a lot about how foreign investment should look at China. If they nationalize BABA get everything out of China. If they fine Ma with a slap on the wrist then and move on then buy Chinese stocks. Both of these represent extreme ends of the spectrum, what actually happens will fall in between.

Well, I got a 2x on GME in March-May, and then rebought in at $4.24 and was selling covered calls on all those shares for months.  I got some called away, but repurchased, and then got assigned on a $15p that I sold for $1.05 right before earnings.

But, since my cost basis in all those shares ended up < $0 from all the call premiums, it was, I guess, an "infinite" return.  :)

Literally like a free $820,000.

Looking like we may not retrace < $20.

Although, we'll have to see next week.

Holy shit! I used to work for the CEO of this company. GREAT guy.
The indexes are green, but I'm getting destroyed. Down 1.8%. I won't financially recover from this until Monday 🤣
We dont read
Alibyebye
No, it doesn't.  In fact, I should have a flair that reads, "ain't learned shit".  I've stopped trying to learn shit, I'm actually making a bit of $ by following meme pumps and the occasional yolo.  The BABA play is a premium flip with no ITM expectation.  Total gamble, but I'm willing to risk a little $ on it.

Edit: RemindMe! 3 weeks
STIC was on cnbc twice, but never actually popped until SIR JACK posted
I’m seeing that I was completely wrong. Brb investing in $ROPE
I don't think we will see any crazy moves till after the 25th. Everything seems on auto pilot ,cept BABA . Poor bastards.
Thankfully my 20k reup doesn't hit rh until Monday apparently
Yeah, i feel the same way. I think this is the top. And to make it worse, I think we are at a point where as things get better, tech will sell off more offsetting the gains from travel, industrial stocks
To all my fallen BABA soldiers:  GUH!  This war is not over.
A rope and a chair, keep it simple imo.
You likely won't continue to make money indefinitely with those holdings.
Not sure, maybe a bit more saw it on tv.

Also you avoided my question like a little bitch coward.
If baba gets delisted, do shareholders lose all their money?
Dude only place to go from here on WISH is up. I jumped on the bot with you yesterday. Bought july calls because when this catches fire it will double
[well that happened faster than I thought it would](https://reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kjdkdk/_/ggwjk64/?context=1)
R we buying baba long?
Imagine this happening to amazon
Im hoping this does well. Ford gave me the boot and stuck me with the bill on a $7800 engine replacement that they won't cover. Bumming a car for 4 months has sucked.
[deleted]
GME down .33 cents and it’s going to cause mass panic lol. Hold your shares retards. We aren’t going to moon everyday of the week. Resume moon mission next week. Stop buying weekly calls.
More like CCP wanted to buy another aircraft carrier so they shorted BABA
Daddy pow
Yeah, woke up this morning to see my shares down 16%... (yes shares because fuck you). Merry fucking Christmas
If it doesn’t seem to be breaking out I’ll probably sell next week or the week after while its still got some extrinsic value
Baba a buy at $200 weekly support?
Tsla go ⤴️ call contracts value go ⤵️
Why am I in NIO calls again?  Did I think it was seriously going back to $50 soon?
GE is a good play right now but shhhhh
XL is starting that late-day U-Turn. Get in while you can.
its prob just a temp pull back but i want to hear about the WSB bro that finally fomo into GME at 21+
I Bought BABA LEAPS !! Happy now? I said it! Lol
Nothing like losing over 7k Christmas eve! How fun
I loaded up more this morning on the dip. I think it's going to pop in the next two weeks but has resistance above 52
Are those FDs? Maybe. Theta decay still hits tomorrow but I wouldn't lock in a loss greater than 30%. We could rocket up at anytime.
Regardless SPY goes up
Dumped all LMND yest at $135 phew

BABA 100 EOY
Alexa stop playing bulls on parade

I don't know how high it's gonna get, but I don't plan on selling for a bit
That's far enough out for them to do another flight attempt. I say hold it until the day before the next test flight.
Bought GME this morning 

This is nice
Missed the bottom by a lot when buying up.

Ah well, nice to have positions sorted before I go away.
Buy the FEYE dip???

1/2022 30c
just be patient if you wanna ride the amd wave their ER will come and so will ur tendies.

BABA 12/31 P's

You mean support?
Christmas Eve portfolio massacre in fucked
Can’t believe jd is dropping too, I really thought I had a big brain play
http://i.imgur.com/ESGPzyW.jpg
When do you think you will buy more baba?
Scenario 3 is higher. GME already has \~$1 billion in ecommerce sales. CHWY for comparison has \~$7 billion of ecommerce sales and is valued at \~42 billion today (about 6x ecommerce revenues). While CHWY's valuation is based on extreme growth going forward, if we assume that a fair value for an ecommerce company is even half of that multiplier (i.e. 3x online sales), then GME should be worth at least $3 billion today. That doesn't factor in any additional growth that GME is able to create, which could raise sales figures into the billions. even if the company only manages to capture \~10% of the gaming market (about $175 billion worldwide today), all in ecommerce sales, if we base the value of the company on even a 1x multiplier then the company would be worth $17.5 billion or $265 a share. While the growth scenario is very much a projection, it shows that there's definitely space for the company to be worth billions in the future.
What is the deal with TSLA? Is this stock going to 1000 or what? I keep selling puts and betting against Elon and I keep losing! FML
I just need it to drop 3 more dollars in before end of day.  Otherwise I'm poor
Buy BABA leaps?
anybody buying a 660 p on tsla?
[deleted]
F
Im not worried about the GME dip today, but its really not gonna be fun having to look at this big ugly red line on rh until monday lol
N p a going to follow s. R. A. C.   Also, jump your punk asses on the $wish train before it catches fire
30k into ARKG 1/15
Theta gang has enter the chat.

I don't give a fuck which way it moves as long as it stays above $31
Diamond handers now trying to remember why it was a good idea
Quick EOD call to make lunch money what’s everyone got????
Buy 12-31 34c
Idk if to hold thru or sell the news
The fact PLTR is still going up week by week despite this daily immense downward pressure is amazing
Dang, 1k in BABA 250P yesterday at close would’ve been worth >100k 🥴
BABA....scorched earth....
That’s when you sell the news.
Just dumped by BABA leaps for a -99% loss 🤡 rolled whatever's left into puts, leggo!
Yup and my calls thanks it, cashed out too bby
So it's actually 5:30...

[http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=What+time+does+the+market+close+on+christmas+eve](http://letmegooglethat.com/?q=What+time+does+the+market+close+on+christmas+eve)
😂😂😂
Down $7. Nnever going to finanancially recover from this.
at this point i’m fucking done with chinese stocks i’m going to hold on to what i have and hopefully break even within the next year
My take from this is that stimulus checks = GME moon

Mooned when they confirmed 600$ and died when confirmed no checks until next week
You are a legend.
Sweet CRSR sell off
No, fuck you. I doubled my money twice with CNK so far this year. TL; DR: Fuck you.
Let’s see if spy can hold. I have spy puts rn to balance out some of my calls
Do I swap BABA for PLTR?
no, don't do that at this current IV.

Sell put credit spreads, or buy call debit spread.
Oh my god, loss porn would be red. Gain porn would be green. THOSE R CHRISTMAS COLORS
Feel ya! I'm still learning how to hold and not run when there are signs in my favor! 

Get them fking gains homie
"but this week was so green" lol. Like a handful of tickers were green this week but idiots acting like this was a green week around here.
🤡s in here told people to buy the BABA "dip" at 280 lmao tHE ChiNeSE AmaZOn
Someone reassure me that this is an overreaction on BABA
4 was possible at 9.9% but not anymore.

With the bb thesis gone and this p/s ratio we should be in the 4b.

After that, who knows....
LISTEN RETARDS XL REVERSAL IS NEXT WEEK HOP IN THIS DIP OR CRY LIKE GME HOLDERS
🤡🤡
Hmm, now I just need to raid a museum.
Yeah. HK -8%, US -16%

I'm thinking they know more about the CCP than we do here
I wonder the same thing...such a POS stock
[deleted]
Enjoying their gains and not working today I guess...
Already in for Jan 29 call with a $14 strike price. also 12/31 with a $18 strike. hold my dick
Yesterday, all my troubles seemed so far away..
Guilty as charged, I followed him on CRSR and GME and got tendies out of it. 

Follow the money
Don’t do it I have the subscription
Steel shortage = Crash the entire economy. Sure MT will print, for a while; but there will be nothing left to buy.

Think of it like charging a premium on air as it goes scarce. You will make massive profits, but after everyone suffocates the market will drop.
- Check BABA
- Try not to cry

breaking news: BABA admits to causing covid.
You can donate stock?

Brrrr
I love how tsla is just dancing while the market is on its period, tsla that type of guy to fuck during a period
🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔🔔
Its China...a thousand years is short term for them
Looks like Baba's fnally turning around 210 seems to be the bottom
3 day rule
😂
Ah yes the revenge trade. You got lucky, i wouldn't make this a habit
This é le camino
who?
It's truly amazing how dysfunctional the US govt is.  It looks like yet another shutdown is going to happen, even if it is short.  The US govt can't even fund itself to stay open, which happens almost every. single. year at this point.  COVID relief, which should be an obvious, can't even pass after months of bullshit.  Every single minute thing has to turn into an ideological WWF Summer Slam cage match brawl that goes on for forever.
I bought the 370/380c call debit spreads for 1/15. If it closes above 380 on 1/15, I’m Gucci
I bought BABA today at bell -8%. I got jaded I didn't realize it's now -17%. Nothing is real
There’s your support on BABA
*edited
Fuck you spy im holding these 370 calls
yeah... imagine....
Anyone gonna buy leaps on BABA?
GH..IV PRINTING DOE
Lmao that does put a smile on my face!
Just a reminder that it's only money. Unfortunately, money buys shit.
Such easy money to play the swings. Might miss out when it finally breaks through but it is what it is

Free dips on a bunch of stuff!

Bought the PLTR dip
Man...you were right....
Am I able to display my RH portfolio on a big screen outside my house and call it festive decoration? 

This shit is flashing red and green
ARKG WTF
TSLA market cap higher than BABA

LOLOLOL


ALIBABA INTELLIGENCE
That FUBo drop is crazy given all the recent price upgrades
Got 2k give me something good to hold over the weekend
Why they are killing it today and have been all week?
Why did he get banned?
XL showing signs of life

Edit: or not lmao 2% drop in half a second, just not gonna look at it until Monday
I'm trying to close out some covered calls I sold on the pump. 50% gain in 30 minutes :)
Exit 50x 110 1/15 TSM for a loss?

My premium is 2.65 and its at 2.31 rn
Less than 2 hours
Brexit probably
Lmfao everything down besides TSLA Falcon launching past the moon rn
Oh, I understand the idea and why the assumption/speculation exists, but at this point it just seems like someone trying to pump NIO way earlier than it will happen.

If APPL and NIO are going to partner for the iCar, but the iCar isn't expected for 4 years, the partnership news may not be out for awhile. Now is "awhile" a month, a year, or even going to happen? Not sure. Right now it relies on a guy who worked at both companies.
Sold my other half at the top. Ill take it.
This was removed?! This was quality fucking content!
That's fair. Best of luck to you
FSLY sold off more than BABA did for less
Why is Corsair tanking again lol
ARKG rug pull 😡
I kind of wanna buy this BABA dip but I don’t trust chinese companies and unduly influence the gov can exert on them
Literally not impressive. Idk why people praise these guys. Like you know he started with 1.36m. $1 stock price increase is nearly a 100k increase for him. Anyone can do that, esp with stocks (options is way risker).

Give me 1.36m and ill invest in GE, $1 increase would be 135.8k.

&#x200B;

WSB isnt for rich kids getting 1.4m and just investing, no shit you'll make 400k on a trade. WSB is for people turning 5k into 50k
I'm not selling!!!!



Holding psth, mt and stic



Just think of this as paying less in taxes this year
Are $ROPE stores open on Christmas Eve?
If you don't buy this dip, you ain't chinese
Good Point.  What is the next entry....$190?
except you never know what the CCP is capable of. I myself think this is over cooked, but you just don't know. 

plus, BABA is already pretty weird from corporate structure standpoint, ADR investors don't have a lot of protection. 

However, yes, usually a good thing to buy during blood in the streets
Lol, I didn't see any option for flairs
Look at the size of it's competition not in absolute values
We will win
my degenerate 0DTE contracts agree with you
....did I blow my load too soon then?
[removed]
HAHAGAHA TIGGERED BABA HOLDER IM DUMPING MORE NOW !!
Part of me genuinely believes BABA might not be an overreaction. CCP could annihilate that company.
Sure it is...

This is the one pharmaceutical that will buck the trend.
Same
If you believe you have the worst luck and happen to be bagholding BABA, take one for the team and sell so BABA can moon.
True but this has been an ongoing saga for me
FCELL about to burst. Paper hands have been shaken off and volume is increasing! 📈
Yeah that's pretty bad. Sorry about your day.
This is why I love options 

You could have bought 20 BABA 12/31 230p for $30 each = $600 total 

Now there worth $19.00 a piece = $38,000 in less then 12 hours
godspeed to you

Holy fuck i got slaughtered today, just woke up

MT, C, MS, PLTR, RIOT sell off and all my calls are fucked

SWEET
Don’t FOMO if you really have to make sure the stock has not passed 2 percent. Buy the dip, and never play earnings.
Wait. Not even a dip to buy into rn.
The welcome package should include a vasectomy
can arkg continue to go down so i can buy please thank you
You retards are getting pumped by the mods. Monday is going to be a bloodbath for you diamond hands, bag holding idiots. RIP.

Good thing my $90K in 20C,25C,30C  calls expires May
Damn even the Chinese dont fuck with Chinese companies...smart.

No really go to a gamestop right  now and tell me what you see.  I would wager your average console owner has a larger collection than gamestop. You can't even get a charging cable for a controller.  The only thing gamestop stocks these days is pre-orders.  Literally empty boxes "coming soon".  That's it. Wal-mart stores beat gamestop and that's saying something.

BABA BIG FUCKED
Still pissed at them for crashing my 35c expiring today.  But I'm sure this romance will rekindle eventually.
[removed]
Hope that BABA quits fucking it up for everyone is the only play for NIO right now. People are too retarded to do any DD and realize NIO is actually backed by Chinese government and plays ball with them. Instead they see BABAs issues and "hurr durr all China stocks bad"
Paper hands are getting out now, here comes the boom
fuck outta here lmao
Shares. We told you to buy GME shares.

Paper Hand pussies have been shaken out. Time for FCEL to hit that Christmas Rally 🚀🚀
Coincidentally a "Melvin" is a variant of the wedgie that punishes the front business instead of the back, much like how GME puts will punish your gainz

Haha I literally lol’d at this so thanks for brightening my day. If it’s any consolation, I meant to sell some March $300c against my Jan ‘22 300c and accidentally bought the March $300c and sold for an immediate loss of $50 each

I'm sorry you're projecting what's going on with your wife and her boyfriend into this post, but just know with these winnings you can get all the viagra you need to get some blood flowing into that 2 inch limp biscuit of yours.

Edit: because I see you've added a suggestion to short in your previous. You're dumber than I thought if you're suggesting to short a stock that is basically already at its price floor.

I don't know why your daddy would touch you whenever he took you to the movies, but you need to stop letting it effect your financial decisions.
Only thing better than an autist is a whole f'ing room of autists. My dad used to say that the best way to win was in fact to let the whole f'ing world think you are stupid. He was right. Been stupid for some time now and have no plan to let up. 2021 is going to be something else!
Can’t tell if BABA is a potential value play at this point, or the Chinese government is literally out for vengeance. Hard to imagine they cripple one of their best companies?
We’re literally down $2 on the week wdym
He's clearly using the sub as a pump and dump. People follow him blindly.
[removed]
Meh. Hoa Karen is worse
I'm gonna ask you one question, and you have to be honest.

Do you think more people saw his post or watched the segment live or on YouTube later?
BABA should bounce back, this kind of shit even happens in the US where the government all of a sudden decided to “break up” a major company. You’ll see the share price fall drastically but it’ll rebound within a year.

Just a ploy at insider trading. Chinese politicians probably shorted BABA last week. US did the same thing recently with Apple and Google.
Buy the baba dip?
Bought at 18.5 at open 🥴
ICLN
Just wait till Jan.

Everything is down but SPY is up...ok
I got burned bigly last rug pull and learned no matter how much potential this stock has, it is toxic waste until this anti trust stuff is resolved. That being said, if it goes to 200 it will be very temping.
Holy fuck PLZ STOP THE DRILLING BABA. Worst christmas ever.
Options are stressing me the fuck out. Another week of winning at the beginning of the week just to lose it all and more by the fucking end

Lol at this pump and dump. Good that I didn't FOMO.
even this sub said to buy stocks not options on gme
Bull case for ICLN in 2021 is Dems will talk big game about clean energy initiatives and every time they do that ICLN will go up. Then the big pump comes from when they actually get a bill together on clean energy
Dalio must be feeling pretty bad right now. His 42 year old son dies earlier in the week, and now his china baby, BABA, dies on thurs.

Dalio, if you're reading this, I'm sorry buddy.

100s of billions
Holy shit BABA.
Well, there goes my first week trading options, feel like I picked a horrible week to start. God fucking damn is this shit a roller coaster ride. I honestly don’t know how some of you take 2-10k losses so well, regardless of your portfolio or financial situation. I guess I’ll get used to it. 
Only lost like 500 which I’m sick over but I feel the lessons I learned were almost worth it. 
Let’s get filthy rich next year you dick heads🥂

Trying to post a dank meme, but the auto mods are being gay like usual today
PLTR going green today would truely be a Christmas Miracle, please papa Karp, make it happen.
PLTR fucked hedge funds and shorters so hard that they will risk going under just to make sure it never hit 30 EOY.
My FUBO & BABA call's 01/15/21 RIP
MITCH BETTA HAVE MY MONEY!
The only thing that still makes sense now is NKLA is slowly dying into single digits
Don’t fight the Fed 📈, Don’t fight the CCP 📉
I bought them as part dividend part investment play so I'm not super worried but it feels bad buying in August and seeing it lose that $270 resistance last month.

Thanks for sharing your thoughts.
spy 220 6/18
Buy the damn FCEL dip you retards
T H C 🐝 nooo what is you doing
What are some strategies to cut down on my long term capital gains taxes?
Did you play QQQ exclusively the whole time
It’s a fruit company, how can fruit be worth so much

Where’s the rally bulls?! Let’s go! The dips on sale! Make these 🏳️‍🌈🐻 pay!

Why am I up 10% on my BABA calls I bought it at 215 💀
Go tell your parents you think unemployment, Medicare, social security benefits and programs like the New Deal were all bum programs and should be eradicated. That’ll make ‘em proud of your education
We still getting the 2000$ RIGHT😡
Please name a SPAC
Everyone is scared of CCP
Everything I own is red today.  Get on the santa clause rally train!
Just dropped $4,000 in pltr 1/15 28c
Xi is going to use that little bastard Jack Ma as a hood ornament on his Hongqi L5 for the next 2 months or so and then let him go out in the Hangzhou wilderness.
Baba basically same price as it was two and a half years ago.  That’s wild.   Could’ve made a killing with so many other options
My dude it is down 1.5% today after being up 29% the past week.  We're fine unless you bought OTM calls expiring today.

But this has always been a play for like, March or April, so.
What's the play for NIO day
I guess today's red was kind of expected after this green as fuck week
Hey did you know market closes at 1pm today?
Wish I didn’t paper hands baba twice
then buy calls
[removed]
[deleted]
YES PLEASE!  I just bought me some $250 LEAPS's...
ABNB at a day trader's dip. Watch and buy.
?? Why would it
It’s GameStop dude open your eyes. Biggest pump and dump since hertz
Why the fuck did I not sell 🐝 at open
I’m so glad that everything could tank except DASH. Awesome.
BABA $169.95 EOY 🌈🐻🇨🇳
1000 percenters left and right this week crazy



So who did it 5 times and now is a millionaire
Once BABA halts the drop it’s time to buy I think
Lol if you haven’t heard it, it’s a meme

Why, what’s news?
SQ?
XL REVERSAL COMING
pltr has consolidated between 25 and 28 lmao
Jesus sorry man.
PLTR bounces here.
GME pls
Unusual whales plays have been a joke lately

He posted a baba 237.5c 12/31 with a premium of $2.7 that’s not sitting at $1.67 lmao thankfully I didn’t buy that 

He also posted RIOT $9p 12/24 last Friday - that unfortunately I did play like a cuck

That same day he had AAPL 114p 12/24 too

Pretty sure the MMS are just selling these volumes to trick us
Why Santa gotta be like this give me 📈
Why would it go lower?
It’ll be back. Damn near everything’s red hahaha

What strike on PLTR?
Welp. So much for that. Lol
Very smart
I may have missed out on 100% gains but at least I have 50% gains
Is there a counter argument godfather? What is the only thing that could ground this 🚀? Asking for a 🌈🐻friend.
What are you smoking?  It’s 1pm eastern
Ma Huateng did nothing wrong!

Nio fleas fly in rain
Nio is a buy rn. Keep watch for a dip and enter. The only reason it's down is because of BABA and maybe because calls expire today. It'll push up to the NIO day on Jan 9th.
Ban
NIO might dip down to 40 before reattempting \~49/50 again.  Look at the chart, it's trading in a range: \~38 lower, \~49/50 upper.  I put a 'feeler' call into play, waiting for it to tap the lower bound and head up a bit before adding to my position.  March calls.
[removed]
I haven't been this poor since Tuesday. It's rough.
woa...lol

any show polish around? might be better?
PSTH. Should be a target announcement soon. In Bill Ackman we trust... Check it out. 

Or you could yolo into GME like I did...

The Ark ETFs won’t ever lose your money either, but not necessarily rocket time there. 

Good luck buddy.
Usually for the holidays I’d think about spy calls but I feel like there’s more catalysts for it to drop this year
Described as a "corporate husk". Got them a Shitron style hit piece.
I thought y’all said it was illegal to be red on Xmas eve ? 😐

Baba is dead
Its a joke relax
Me too buddy, me too.
I just sold. 3k loss today baby
[deleted]
My portfolio rn: You get to see a new daily low! and YOU get to see a new daily low!! and BABA let’s take you back to lows untouched since June!!!
I can’t believe people sell Stocks like NIO and Xpeng when they are at the low point before a bull run. People are literally so stupid it hurts to imagine it
I’m learning my lesson when trusting this sub LMAO lost everything in PLTR... just lost 60% of my portfolio in GME lmao
Christmas sale!

All I want for...VIX 26🎄
Ss-sssanta rally?? Help
If you have to ask you need to do some googling before fucking with options lol. But to answer your question, no you don’t need to own shares to sell puts. You either need level 3 options approval or you need cash to cover the cost of the shares if you were to be assigned
Well done man ! A great Christmas story
Been up for straight 3 nights putting this chart together for my pltr gang ❤
[removed]
I hope you made the nice list this year!!!
PLTR been doing this for a month.  why is everyone surprised.
Why isn’t baba being halted?
Lol...I’m in for 50 Jan 30C/35C spread... 

Money comes and goes by gains are forever....
Bad day. Wait for alibaba goes to 190

As a Chinese:

IMAGINE BASING YOUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO ON BABA WHEN NEWS OF POWER STRUGGLE BROKE IN OCTOBER LMAOOOOO THERE'S A REASON CHINESE AVOIDED IT LIKE PLAGUE DESPITE THEIR PROFITS
GME available shares to short went to 4K from 150k at 945 am this morning before going back to 150k by 10am. The war is on
Can someone please explain the crazy volume for $BILL 130p 1/15, is it due to hedging of institutional investors who bought lots of $BILL?

How is removing the tariffs good for steel?
i think its gonan dump today, and moon back up monday

Like I said, I’m holding but seeing [some evidence](https://www.bbb.org/us/ga/atlanta/profile/acquisitions/north-star-acquisitions-group-0443-28098983/complaints) that makes me suspicious.
TSLA Cleanspark and SBE coming in clutch to save my portfolio
I did unfortunately
Don’t forget 1pm today
It's a few weeks. Do you have calls or what do you have?
Nice. It’s nice to see even the slightest profit. I’ve been seeing so much loss porn today. With it being so close to christmas, it’s nice to see people win. I’ve made 3k this year, cheers to more 💵💰
That's why you buy shares on GME, not options. Buy shares, we keep telling you, why are you not listening. WHY ARE YOU NOT LISTENING.
PLTR wiping out the paper hands ! To resume moon mission soon 🚀🚀🚀💎🖐 it's the real fucking deal boys!!!!
worst week ever... FUCK THIS
Life is tough on the streets
Aliexpress’s christmas sale is CANCELLED
For some reason I woke up and said "lets chase some shit." stupid.
True retards are still in GME. I hope all of you with weeklies sold the past 2-3 days before you lost a bit off the top.
F it, I just got in on some LEAP's... Can't go tits up.
PLTR you stupid ugly whore. You’re gonna knock my 1/15 calls OTM soon. Cunt.
I'm getting fucked good today
Going for the Deray Mckesson look
I actually cannot believe this BABA shit. There’s no chance they keep this up for long this is such an overreaction
So we’re gonna get cucked again with stimulus. 

SPY 360 12/28
While they do not share how many refunds there have been, they *do* factor the refunds into the sales number. It's not inflated.
Guys it's right before Xmas. We knew everything would go down. If you sell PLTR now you are a moron and a coward. The UK just signed a deal with them yesterday.
somebody need to pass the morphine drip to these baba bros out here
Good to know.  Thanks!
Jack Ma you Minecraft headed mofo, why couldn't you keep your fucking mouth shut back in November?  
  
Fucker singlehandedly wiped of billions in market cap with 1 fuckin sentence
ok friend. DIamond hand  turn it off and come back monday. were still so far up this week were good.  Unless you are dumbass that has shit expiring today.
Well if I could download all my groceries on one dedicated website, I sure as hell would
Any thoughts on Stelco Holdings or Russell Metals?
[removed]
Almost bought BABA $300 January expiration 😤 glad I trusted my gut and not the sub
Baba down 100$ since top
I think alot of people are loosing money today
Biden will receive A LOT of backlash if he removes the tariffs. Mittal is a total pos and has little presence in the US now. Mittal doesn’t care about your money, only his and his yachts. He is going to still get rich off of American steel purchases but not through MT.

Yeah i dumped it too. I just looked it in the eyes and realized i didn't love it anymore.
perfect time to hop on this FCEL dip 🚀🚀🚀
NKLA and BABA digging to find the bottom first...smh
Holy fuck BABA
BFT getting its Dick a lil wet today
Low volume. Gonna wait for the bleed all day and then enter before close

Fuck it bought 30 shares in BABA to hedge against my fucked calls 🤡
Let’s all say it together: GUH
No shit retard
Sometimes I look at these graphs and I'm inspired to waste all of my money on some internet fucker that drew lines on a colour chart, love you all
Good for you man. That’s awesome
That's why it dumped lol

If you are buying BABA shares just sell a put instead (if you can cover)

Premiums are high right now
It just keeps dipping. I though 220 was the floor
RIOT and VLDR FUCKING ME

Great time to load up
On ARKK leaps
Godfuckingdamnit
BABA is negative for the year LMAO
I think institutional brokers are running it down in toe with one another to squeeze as much profit into 2021 as they can.
This is too good
LOL low volume moves and you think this is it? Remind me Monday

Keep going, just don't go full throttle with your account! I think you know this already though 🥳
[removed]
Canoo sucks
Fucking Polar bears ate Santa.
i'm not exactly bullish on baba, but this thing has lost like \~30% of it's value in \~2 months.  it's not like their revenue is tanking, so exactly how much lower should it be expected to drop
Tfw you wanted to buy STIC yesterday, but E-Trade refuses to make your funds available until the 30th for no fucking reason.  


Feels bad.

Must be investment firms selling off to close out the year

Is RH desktop down?
Steel bro, thanks
Wth was that GME sell off
We’ll get em next year boys
oh fuck. Calls on IPAs. best beers out there
I’d risk $2K on it, at that price point.
Bruh im not even going to log on, everything shitting the bed super hard
buy the Tencent dip! free money!
Stop the BABA
GME big sadness. Holding though we aren't pussying out of this shit
Well she bought baba at 260
The Guardian hates the deal but then again what would I expect from them. CNN says Brexit deal leaves UK weaker and poorer. Fox News loves the deal. So I’m guessing this hurts labor and middle class workers in UK. 🤷‍♂️
aliBAbA iNtElLiGenCe 🥴
Xi canceled christmas, the way he intended
That was my interpretation as well. He thinks MT has a much higher potential upside. You have calls out to June, right?

This is the way
Buy the fucking dip on PLTR
[deleted]
[deleted]
rip anyone with baba calls, now theyre red for the year
Jesus god bless all the Baba put holders. Fuck
Listen, I get it.  Money is paper, but the time you spent getting that money is literally your life. Your most important thing.
[deleted]
Is BABA still a value stock or a value trap?
[deleted]
What y’all think of MDB?
Touching your BABA sounds kinda dirty...
Dear Diary,
Today I lost 3k on BABA. My monthly portfolio gain wiped out
How do the U and WS warrants work on these bad boys
Tell me why I shouldn’t offer my first born on baba? They actually make money
With markets closing early I think I’m just gonna hold it was only around 1.72 per contract
Oof
Well it’s been a great week overall if today’s gonna be a red day at least it’s over by 1pm
You sound angry, can I have present, dad?
Fucking a PLTR. I keep averaging down on my 30c 1/15s but I'm almost out of money. Should I stop and just wait it out?
They're selling off BABA like it's going bankrupt or somethin'
I would think about buying the dip if my ass didnt look so red goddamn
Calls on literally anything are free money today. The next 3 months are about to be a beautiful bull run
[deleted]
How many Yolo’s?
Just one?
Baba calls are still dummy expensive
Yep, me too. Followed Cathie like a retard.
Convenient!
Amazing how quickly my account turns red. What a showing by baba and PLTR
Also depends on if you file jointly or single.  By ya that’s pretty much correct.  Unless you live in Puerto Rico for 6 months out of the year then you don’t pay any capital gains taxes after you move there on new positions.
GOEV 🚀🚀

Price target is $30
Why am I still buying RKT :(
Tech down left and right. Who let the Grich run the market today??
Buy a boomer ETF. Don’t knock consistent gains. After a year you’ll forget all about WSB.
those leaps are still fucked no?
What's your best yolo of the year?
You have a connection with CCP insiders?
Oof that sucks, sorry man. All my calls are March ‘21 or Jan ‘22 so I’m not too worried, just hope Dorsey isn’t going full retard on me
[removed]
Haha you are all so fucking stupid on here holy shit
Remind Me! 5 days
Nah fam they're just warming up the fuel cells
[deleted]
You'll see a green candle... on the put price. I warned you guys...
I should know better to play crm
right? Not gonna lie I feel RKT is going to hit like 19.89 and then skyrocket to $23-25 just gut feeling
SELL SELL SELL
PLTR on sale 🥂🚀🚀🚀
Thank you!!
They entered their PLTR trades at open. They had no idea what they were in for. Now they're staring at six MMs with guns drawn. It was a fucking ambush.


This was a fucking bomb dropping on WSB. For a few seconds, this place was Armageddon!

#There was a SELLOFF!
Yes
Weedmaps SSPK pump hop on the train chu chuu
Yeah I got fucked on this one, I'm gonna be stuck with this boat anchor for prob 2 years until/until I can find something else solid to turn it around.
Don't forget about pltr today too...
I think TSLA will keep YO-Yoing between 620-660.

Hard to say if market is pricing in them meeting delivery targets or not. Thats gonna be the next catalyst for some kind of movement outside of that range I'd imagine
thats already half complete
Coming here to comment my daily “Fucking PLTR”
[deleted]
Glad I sold my BABA call for -50% yesterday instead of -99% today, cutting losers saved ya boy a rack
My plan to buy the top was successful.
It’s touching me, fffff. I just bought that dip today too.
Multimillionaire
RIP aliBlahBlah
If only I learned my lesson...smh
wut?
Salivating at BABA. When it hits $200, buy $300 2022 LEAPs?
MM’s doing the most right now
GME is going down! What the fuck! Why didn’t you tell me it was going to do that??? 

/sarcasm
Where can I buy

Edit: Sell these and put all of the profit into GME calls
A bit much on BABA lol
Damn my ARKG calls are toast aren't they
moving my portfolio from $GME to $ROPE
I’m just not looking at RH today
LMAO AND YOU GME CALL HOLDERS DIDNT THINK IT WOULD DUMP. LOOOOOOOOOOOL. TOLD YOU GUYS YESTERDAY. ITS GOING TO DUMP HARDER. GTFO!
Already all in
This feels exactly like the half day before Thanksgiving
Cost basis is 14.29. Balls fucking deep
Down $300 from palantir, baba, ARKK Leaps. 

Up 700 from Tesla.

Update: I’m down 400 now and up 600
Where's the winner takes all post
NKLA dead and buried
STOP THE COUNT
Made a small fortune buying NKLA puts when it spiked to 30 days before the lockup expired. Could there have been a more obvious play?
My wife's boyfriend is gonna be so pissed I second mortgaged our home on 12/24 $30Cs on GME yesterday :/

So you can buy one on BABA? Thanks for supporting the cause.
Webull has some really cool visualizations of potential profit etc.

Still not the easiest platform to use but they really have some potential
Lol idiots ruining their own Christmas Eve with weeklies.
why tf are people acting like PLTR is dead lmfao
The $28 PLTR covered calls I sold on Monday is now OTM. Lol.

I wonder who held it for so long without exercising it. Fucking idiot.
Cool story bro
[deleted]
Thank you.
BABA 1Y graph looks absolutely disgusting
Same
Like Buzz Lightyear, ARK is buy and hold for infinity and beyonddddddd
AMC can get fucked in the ass until it stops being a circle. Fuck you too in the ass for trying to pump this unpumpable limp dick of a stock. AMC is owned by careless, reckless, dickless idiots. Buy CNK and stay the fuck away from AMC. It’s future is bankruptcy or being acquired for 10% of NAV. If anything, short this piece of shit.
No mans land?
So after blowing up my account on weeklies, I’ve decided to become a more conservative inventor and put all my paychecks into long term PLTR calls. Can’t go tits up!
Yeah ZM is spooky but 1/15 is a close enough expiration that I’m not super worried.
Ouchie
https://i.imgur.com/NmZIAVM.jpg
I think your name suits you
Q4 results.
I was looking at BABA 220C or 215P

Both were around 1.50, wetn with 220C, its down 60% already, 215P, up 100%.

all in ten mins

Is BABA even a buy at 200?
Yeah my put spread is dead
Gonna get higher
Tell ya after next week.
[removed]
Protip: It's a shit-tier stock
NIO, been buying since march 🚀🚀🚀
Why do all GME posts keep getting removed?
Copped 200 shares of GME @ $21.24, Merry crimbo cunts
give it a good spanking for being naughty and give it coal for christmas
I told you not to sleep on BTWN and here we are, rotation from Baba to Tokopedia
Short trading day with a closed market tomorrow. 

Probably see a lot of selling off as we get closer to the 1:00 close.

I'm only a few months into this but each holiday week has had a small selloff.
How tf is spy green
Keep at it and you'll be homeless again and ready to start over. This is the way. 

Congrats on the gains.
Can you see the exact time I sold 100 of them today in the price chart? Just look for the drop at 8:45 :)
Thanks for sharing. Trying it now, having trouble with the [stockbot.py](https://stockbot.py) command (sorry I am noob trying to learning this stuff). I downloaded matplotlib and yfinance fine but getting: "No such file or directory" error when I run:

Personal connection.
WOW, WTF BABA. I am just sitting here watching my years of BABA gains vanish. WTF. Luckin 2.0
Yep pltr sucks, sold my put to early
There is but he got Covid and he's super old so...
which dip should i fucking buy, so many of them
Finally? He was banned for like 20mins
PLTR is in Denver. Lots of sunny days.
Upside of MT in Vale
Fun fact: the big boys get paid by what they have under management. It’s the end of the month, quarter, & year.  Follow the big guys money as they pump their #s up just before they charge their customers....and then sell the profits the next day.
BABA back to the 2010 xmas
NIO at it's last support area around 45.60 then no mans land. F
HYLN and RKT are the grinches of Christmas
Yeah. I feel like a spread is the way to go. But I'm feeling like spy 1dte calls @ 2% out isn't unreasonable. Congress knows they are about to get butt fucked by the new year if they don't do shit over the weekend.
F
No sir right to 25 please so I can drop a mortgage on it
You can call me a king because I'm being royally fucked by NIO and PLTR right now 🤴👑
let's see what the geniuses over at stocktwits have to say about BABA
Grabbed one ☝️ might average up if it keeps drilling
[deleted]
Mostly $SHOP $NET $PLTR and $IIPR. Had heavy positions in $ZM at 65$ avg that I sold off
nigga we at all time highs basically
Don’t worry boys! Everything is red today... hold strong!!!
GME pls.....don’t do this to me.
rip pltr, but hold strong boys, itll be back
Should climb to 30 then sit for half a year until they get there online presence known. Then they either beat the competition or they do enough just to stay competitive. Either way this stock feels undervalued and should climb easily to 30 and then after half a year to 40+
Down $300 from palantir, baba, ARKK Leaps. 

Up 700 from Tesla.
If you removed BABa then you would leave a crater sized hole in your best economic producer. If the CCP wants to shoot it self in the foot. Then I guess that is their choice. But BABA can move it's head quarters. They are not forced to operate in CCP.
Not even considering it until it goes under $200.
Don't worry too much, I would imagine they will stack up some of the gravy from biscuit by proxy. I dont see their their balance sheets but I wouldn't guess that lumber makes up more than 20% of their overall profits
All my shit is like 5% down. Omfg
I guess now is as good a time as any to jump into PLTR. Was waiting for a good dip before buying.
[removed]
[deleted]
I don't know what I am, but if buying GME shares constitutes as a value investment (I mean, it is definitely undervalued, that's for sure), then I'm that...

the main reason I chose GME over anything else right now is because, of the 15-20 stocks I know a thing or 2 about and keep track of, GME seems to be the prime candidate to 2x my money or more, but do it faster than any other. We'll see, but so far, it's proving my theory to be correct.

&#x200B;

I'm ready for it to dip back to 17, it wouldn't surprise me, but I'm gonna remain bullish at least until June 2021. By that point, we'll have a lot more insight into what's really going on behind the curtains.
Link?
Ok Palantir, it's not funny anymore.
Jesus ducking Christ BABA wtf
Yes, it can go down. No, it probably won’t average 2% a day like the last month. But if you are disciplined Cathie going to make you some money
Is NIO getting monopoly for investigation too?
make it stop make it stop
Christ they really killing baba. I’m so fucking glad I bought leaps Jesus
Why did you get banned?
Not been following NKLA at all, has Trevor sold out yet?
I really should give up, just losing money nonstop
Pls buy Put Credit spreads in danger
Just think that will all the money you lost on PLTR weeklies you could've just bought solid LEAPs from the start🤷‍♂️
Must be buy now sell later
market is flat yet my portfolio is down 10% what a classic
buy the SRNE dip folks
[deleted]
If you had calls oof
not every candle can be green. not every day can be green. it just doesnt work that way.

Ok bought XL
By a lot
well this is boring
I had an aunt do that. Bought $500 if my math is right into AFLAC back in the 1950's and never sold it. It was worth right at a million when she died.
So fubo not gonna stop going down huh
Not so sure about that... chinas antitrust means a lot more than us antitrust....baba is barely red on the year
sir this is a wendy’s
[deleted]
Gets bought by JPM and they start selling £1 cigarettes
Got this weird feeling China and BABA are in cahoots. This "antitrust" move by the chinese govt is just window dressing. China wants to show the business globe they hold their domestic companies accountable, so "please come foreigners, your business is safe here, there is no preferential treatment for domestic Chinese companies."
I'm also too retarded to use said script in question
You can’t even buy puts on nikola because while they’re up bigly the premiums are so low cause no one wants to exercise these turds
Probably. Guess that means BUY MORE. oh shit bruh im your good luck charm. FUCK YOU the stock is gonna plummet! (😉)

It's 1 thing to play a pump and dump.

It's another to hold one  thinking it's a long term hold.

So many of them here.
Sameo
Lmao Fck you CRM
Knew it was coming, but I got absolutely faded today.
forget Christmas can we just skip to Monday?
Congrats and fuck you
thank the lord

Could we get an F for BABA gang (including me)
Why PLTR is going down?
I sold my calls at open for a 50k loss, glad I did.
No its not.
Going long, CRM or DKNG???
BABA going under like it's about to go for a massive surgery
Gotta be emotionless to the money. It's just paper. It thinks nothing of you and you should think nothing of it. It's an item used to exchange for goods and services as opposed to having to barter and fight.

Why sell?
[deleted]
[deleted]
Who had BABA calls that were expiring today?
This ARKK dip looking tempting
I would pay so much money to have access to a full time live stream following Jack Ma for the next week or so. Even more money than I already lost on BABA
You think it’ll keep going up 3% everyday forever?
closed (for a small loss) my 28.5 PLTR covered calls too early. Shoulda waited till the end of the day and let them expire worthless.

Ah well...

Stocks will not appreciate you as nearly as much as we do, which I know sounds strange given the response so far but after this pans out you will have a thousand upvotes on every future post and be flaired the steel godfather. I appreciate your insight and posts man, you give a lot of effort that you don't have to and tend to respond to everyone.
Fuck it I’m returning my fake Rolex from AliExpress.
RKT mooning into the dirt
Wtf is wrong with CRM
Yeah it looks like in september it bounced back up to 380 and november had strong support. I'm personally not touching zm since it relies on covid but it seems to have good support. Reminds me how nvda had insanely strong support on 480 for the past few months, it was great for a put credit spread.
Imagine thinking you know better than Cathie 😂

-10% today,,, nice.

Merry Christmas
This stock looks primed for a big dump.
Absolutely.. you gotta be crazy not to
Unbelievable overreaction for BABA. Huge opportunity.
all my losses were shorts. all my gains were longs. first rule in and i'm already strapped in
What were you buying
So today doesn't really count, right?
Oh no baba what is going on?
"Not sure. Gonna let the dust settle and gradually ride it up until merger probably"
Oh yea that shits manipulated af u good
Probably no buyers so the price hasn't actually updated at all. The people with those calls are going to be stuck with them until expiry unless BABA can somehow bounce back.
WMT is a tech company and a drug dealer. Bullish
It's speculation that speculation is keeping the price up. China is trying to control that narrative because it benefits them to say it. Others have said speculation is not adding much if any. There hasn't been a rise this quick in many years but it has happened before in a market that didnt have future contracts on iron ore. So it has happened before.
Avoiding the ultra-leftist subreddits today.

I don't want to see those Maoist role players praise China for taking down their Amazon (in such a power hungry, no respect for private property method).
I love how this POS CRM really has no bottom
Is this the bottom for BABA or can it go down any further? Right time to get in for Calls? I know it's unpredictable, but what's your take on it?
Note to self. NEVER trade thanksgiving and Xmas week again. These two weeks have single handedly wiped out my yrly gains

I hope not, they should switch their BABA holdings to JD.

Got it. Thanks again for the tip mate. Appreciate it!!
AAPL going strong
Mr. BABA, I don’t feel so good 😞🔫
Good shit! I bought some ARKG/F/K and MOON
Careful going full tilt like I am the past 2 days after consistent successful daytrading the past month.  I know to set stop losses below support because of stop loss hunters but I was so sick of losing I played more defensively, SQ dropped to barely touch $225 and immediately shot up to almost $228.  Tried to make back my 2K loss and turned it into 4K loss today, I’ll let my LEAPS rebound since they’re mostly ITM but damn loss alot of gains suddenly
No

bruh i bought the BABA dip at 290. fuck me

Not now...wait until 12/31
Just got called into HR because I told a coworker "Merry Christmas" instead of "Happy Holidays." Apparently what I said was offensive, not inclusive enough of all beliefs, and disrespectful to assume the coworker celebrates Christmas.

Fuck NIO
Buying this PLTR dip. This is some fucking bullshit.
Fuck you NIO
What kind of braindead monkey uses market order on options? No wonder why sometimes 20% OTM weeklies on TSLA are selling at $2000 per contract at 9:30 am
Sold TSLA calls and yolod into Baba puts. Pray for me
It says volume of 1, but it filled my whole order of 6 instantly and is still available.

Guy probably fucked up and thinks he's selling 2021
crsr go up please
Thanks for the tendies, retard. You were warned.
get into NET
BABA to the core
Yup I tried to warn everyone 2 days ago about it. I sold naked calls on those absolutely insane premiums. 75c jan 15 were going for 6 a pop hahah. Sold 10 of those easy 6k gain
🐴BIO June ‘21 $5 calls
So definitely no stimmy deal now. We’re gonna be RED unless they fix that shit
And you know that for a fact? Buy more calls then
It’s the Amazon of China they said.

Phew I thought my 28 short calls on PLTR we’re gonna fuck me but looks like I’m safe.
How are those calls doing
Since when MSFT is volatile? It's been trading sideways for months!!
Cathie dump baba now bitch
Just found out there’s no Santa rally cause there’s no Santa 🎅
Baba Feb and March vibe af. Everytime you thought it couldn't possibly go any lower, it just does lol
I said that last time it dumped from $300 to like $260

I got fucked today. I thought $260 was bottom

Fuck Chinese Stocks man
220 exp 1/8/21
Nio calls down 25%

CRM calls down 36% 

don’t even wanna acknowledge my BABA calls 😭
Going to dump a grand worth of credit from selling calls into GME before end of day, like a true retard. You don't have to buy to close sold calls, it's just free money.

Step 1: Join the military for financial stability.
Step 2: Yolo everything you have into SPAC calls

Baba is the exact reason you don't buy chinese stocks. Get too big? Make too much? Piss off pooh bear? The company is now the states, or they will just shut it down. Bye bye baba.
how the fuck are baba calls not down much from todays all time high? wtf?

edit: theyre not even at all time lows for the day...

I need gold to gap down on Monday. How did I get into this? 😞
Way too fucking high lol. I bought during the runup the other day. Then lowered by doubling down today. 

I'm thinking after Christmas it'll trend upwards once the short report fizzles out. Depending on the velocity I'll either dip out at break even or hold.
That is for the heads up, seems like an opportunity so I just bought today.
dont spit in the wind
That’s after Christmas

This is a fake dump, VXX isn’t moving at all

Yes, but its short volume is 30% and it keeps climbing up. Thinking we see a +20% day in the next few weeks. Everyone is jumping on the EV wave and BLNK seems solid. Short term hold or OTM calls a few weeks out should print
I’m banking on BABA back to $240 by EOY.
I'd like to place a new order. 😎
BABA negative for the year. WTF
G H I V
Chinese government takes control of it and the stock goes to $0.
Lost 50% of my port lmao
are we buying BABA dip?
Some companies are just now leaving SAS environments. The desire to change wont be quick, especially since the “big data” buzz has been in full swing and the investments have already happened. It will be governments and munis for awhile i think. For the record im all in, 700 shares. I think it will be a long slow climb
I grabbed shares after seeing jump today and knowing you throw milliions in. Congrats sir! Merry Christmas 🎄🎁
The CCP always wins. Go for strategic American companies like FCX, MP, and PLTR
Shares are where it’s at.
Reddest fucking green day ever
CRSR is my abusive lover. Who’s yours?

People around here think AAPL is a boomer stock cuz it can't go up 30% in a day. Except AAPL options have been printing tendies left and right and are way safer if you get em a couple months or a year out. Fucking zoomers circlejerking each other about MMs and short squeezes...
Slept in and woke up to -8% of my portfolio gone so far. Merry Christmas

Same I got ahold of some ARKK in my roth today.
It’s going down because people are selling today like retards because other people are doing it. NIO is going to have an insane run up after Xmas I would hold it’s not going lower after a day like this
I don’t ski but there’s no reason why that wouldn’t work
Woh woh woh is that the Grinch trying to make an appearance at our party??? I'm ready to kick his ass and PUMP this party some more with gains lol

Fuck VLDR
Good.  Fuck NKLA aim its ear hole.

As someone who has been hurt a lot  by BABA, I would wait.
Lmfao bruh I left that shit. It literally fucks you every single time
CRSR keeps hurting me and I keep coming back. It's like an abusive relationship. I love you baby
he left the 4 cents in there to make the next 30000000% run obviously
Hell I dont. I bought calls like a dollar below the top. I was up a little bit. Oh it will be good. Lost like 2000$ averaging down 0DTE. Fucking stupid. 
Even CNBC said "why would they want that." idiot.
I hope so. My retarded ass has found a home with you degenerates and I have a new calling.. trying to become autistic
I wouldn't mind owning a few dozen more shares. I'm operating with a small budget, but even now, I'd have a few hundred dollars more in gains if I kept my 13.3 buy price.

But, I've failed timing the entry once already, I'd hate to do it again. FOMO is real before and after you buy, for sure...
Zoom out to the monthly chart kiddo, relax
My attempt to buy at the bottom of FEYE was about an hour too early

I don't get it but fuck it I'm in
Maybe Cathie thought today was the 25th 🤷🏻‍♂️
Wow BABA not even giving bounces to sell
True, everyone has been spamming pltr and gme. Not like it's a terrible thing because that's literally wsb. Too safe and boomer to talk about on wsb unless it's going parabolic or plummeting I guess?
Take the profits and hop back in at 160

Cathie gonna buy the BABA dip
Got the feeling some times the market just needs to be ignored, so it self-restart mooning again just to get back people's attention back.

Is it just me or does ZM have an insane support at 380? Just look at the past months. Ever since the September earnings report, ZM has only fallen as low as 380.


What’s so special about that number? Lmfao.

If you truly understand China you will know this is a ruse. I’ve spent a fair amount of time in China. The Chinese people depend on Alibaba so much that the government would never let it fail. 

Small example - Trying to pay for something in cash a few times to a roadside farmer or small shop owners was insulting and annoying to them. They only wanted to use Ali pay or WeChat pay. Granted WeChat is Tencent, but you get the point here. These big brands are so ingrained in China’s life they are not going anywhere.
How? How do you go from homeless to wealthy in 3 years?

I'm bearish on GME from this price point. This is a purely mechanical/technical move up and will almost certainly not hold.

I'm actually long on PLTR, couple of 25/30c spreads expiring in 3 months.
No one said they won't display ads at all lmao, they'll just use other filtering methods, android could take away its tracking rights since its been created. Not many do though

I exited at $222. Overall an $1800 loss on BABA but I predict it will keep going down for many days, if not weeks. Chinese "regulators" have unlimited power and BABA won't start any real recovery until the outcome of the case is decided.
i hate FUTU what a fucking trash stock

Premiums are cheap today, but aren't going to be cheap tomorrow. There's no point losing sleep over $50 today when the gain is so much higher. 

Investing is like taking an exam. You study and take the test. Whatever happens happens, but at least you know you prepared yourself to the best of your ability. It's the same with investing. Study and research as much as you can, then invest based on your informed and educated opinion and accept the outcome. 

There's so much news out there on steel and comparable stocks that have been rocketing based on the massive supply issue. This is a unique situation in the MIDTERM. It's up to you whether or not you want to invest more into it.

What’s the deal with baba ? Did murica declared war on China ?
Don't sleep on large material suppliers, specially WY. I build houses and lumber yards are getting record orders. Contractors everywhere are already scheduling closing dates into JULY!! This shows no signs of letting up in the immediate future and with earnings coming soon I'd expect some serious 🚀🚀🚀

How’s that big buyback from Intel treating you on 12/24. Please share the nitty on how it really played out. Tarducation.
Yes. Shortened session magnifies market moves. I’m getting in before the lunar new year rally
This was because of the merger and how the street reacted but it’s bottomed out and the last 6 months have been a strong recovery’s I’ve risen it the whole way up abd still see tremendous upside as they scale streaming. Content production is where they really shine and not only do they produce for themselves but others through licensing deals making it a long term net positive spend for the different platforms look at the sum of all parts for your value analysis.

Is trevvy unloading nkla? Nikola is shitting bricks!
NIO crew, are you guys still bullish? I'm down pretty big on the Jan 2022 $47 calls I bought today and am wondering if I should hold. Will this BABA news continue to bring it down, or are you expecting a bounce back?

Hello Melvin
That was the beginning of the end
yeah I always recommend checking OI/volume before opening a spread, and I typically do it on the monthly expiries cause those almost always have higher OI (so Jan 15, Feb 19 etc etc). You'll get a better fill most of the time and will generally be easier to exit when you need to.
NFLX has hentai porn?  Sauce
Sell Jan puts the premium is nice
Appreciate it chief I’ll look for something else. Thought I’d buy the dip
why would you expect a rebound on a company with a monopoly investigation pending on its ceo?
Yea they are overreacting.... BABA is still going to be Amazon of China
How's that penny stock doing?
STIC just drew a Batman symbol, quick.

can anyone give me a tldr explain like im 5 reason why baba is getting hit with antitrust from china? i thought china has authoritarian leadership how are they getting antitrust-ed?
ok im in the bargaining phase, if pltr manages to hold 28 today I'm ok with that
at least you've got pepe
Fuck you 🌈🐻, I can’t wait to see the green candle on Monday
Why even have a half day when there's no volume and it's flat. Ring the bell

I am also hurting but trying to buy the dip today to cost average
You think the stock will be only $25 in April? Or are you suggesting calls.
Oof

Right but the move to the cloud was also sold as data integration, data lakes etc. in those efforts companies implemented data governance and data science platforms. These efforts took multiple years and millions, and they just finished recently if at all. Pltr would replace some of those solutions as a packaged platform. But why do it now? What’s the ROI to switch now?

I finally figured out what it feels like in here. This is the virtual equivalent of standing at the craps table. I don’t know any of you personally, some of you make me laugh, some of you make me a little nervous, but at the end of the night we’re all standing here with the same goal ... beat the house and go home positive.

These dips got me feeling 🥴
How will that help them in the long run? Steam, walmart, target already provide most of what the online community needs. Unless they pay for exclusivity with a video game company to become a sole provider of hit games, I don't see how they're going to survive. But maybe I'm missing something. To me, the end is near.
That can't be right. You have it backwards.

Looking back, I probably have 2-3x more losses than wins but the wins are much much bigger than the double digit losses lmao. It's funny seeing so much red in the gain/losses tab but the winners are so big theyre irrelevant.
It was over when it lost that $220 hill.
Ask the shorters who shorted it at 16 and crying about it on /r/stocks
\+6k since Sunday. AMA.
Well technically everybody. But institutional investors selling off BABA at a substantial loss because of paper hands. 

Also didn't China just write up the laws last year?
perhaps, good luck

They haven't even heard of Microvast and it's ripping, so BARK can only go way higher right? Right?
This is the worst weak of the year for me. Took me forever to save and build up to 5k only to lose it all on TSLA on Monday fuck me man. I got like nothing except for my phone and laptop and I room with some bums.
We put BABA in a spliff
These Amzn and NIO calls are fucking burning what the fuck
Sooo is WSB dying after that rant yesterday by the mods? Or are we cool? I’m legit confused as fuck.
Monday
BABA put-holders booking private jets right now
This guy? Sounds like he’s going long ABAB
Fuck PLTR. all my homies hate PLTR. 😖
Because in China an antitrust case could fucking mean anything, based solely on the whims of the CCP. In the U.S. the regulators have to prove a case, and having good lawyers can actually help.
BAIL OUT BAIL OUTS ITS A TRAP
Yeah makes sense, but the June 18th call for $41 is $3.83. The June $43c is $6.73. 

The ETF right now is trading at $40.96
it’s cuz baba is a stable investment,  it’s not rocket fuel.

BABA stop drilling plz 😞🔫
Lol just bought 2/19/21 105c for NET on the mini dip. Figured it’s longer so if it goes down at some point I have room to hold until it’s up again
Was debating 220C or 215P on BABA, guess which one I chose..damn it

&#x200B;

215P

Positions?
Have faith that next weak will be crazy because today SUX
I cant believe im saying this but theres no way id buy baba at even these levels. China can do whatever it wants to fuck them over
Got it. Thanks so much man! I was a bit worried lol
TSLA carrying SPY. Damn get all these other volatile stocks outta my portfolio. SPY should drop AMZN and MSFT. Too volatile.
Worst casino ever
Just bought some CRM $227.50 calls expiring today on this big dip. Ready for it to bounce back up to the $229-230 range now.
Holy baba
I sold my TSLA 660c yesterday at high thinking that Trump closed the market today :(
3 day rule mayne let it dip 2 days and only consider buying 3rd + day
What expiration date?
[deleted]
I hope PLTR ends above 28.5
institutional investors don't gamble with their money. There's tons of other shit you can buy why risk it on a commie fucked piece of crap
That call is down 5% since I said no so that should be evidence enough. Plus China has complete control on their businesses and they could severely hurt the company with this lawsuit. I’m not saying it’s impossible to gain but not guaranteed
Shares so I’m good but man I’m getting jealous seeing all the other price movement out there.
We smokin that $Baba pak who wants a hit?
The market has been fucked up all year
I feel like TSLA is gonna stay in the 671-662 range until power hour when all of us small autists have sold off our 0d FD’s on RH and then moon 670
Yeah, that's what paper handed bitches and bears fail to understand. A price target of 70 till may-june is completely justifiable WIHTOUT THE SQUEEZE. If RC actually takes over, you can even see prices up to 100s. They're going to 5-7x their market cap in revenue and probably have over 1b in fucking cash after 1q..
The US government will not shut down a business, CCP will without hesitation
The next time zi see someone in this thread say “if you aren’t buying X you’re stupid/X calls today are easy money don’t miss put” I am buying OTM puts on that.

Fucked like a 🦆
U made money u did good
I think we're going to see a solution to their money issues next quarter.

Edit: By the way pretty insane to say PLTR has issues, but GME is fine because Cohen is supposedly the Godsend gift that will solve all their issues, and transition them into one of the biggest online retailers competing with Amazon and other already established retailers?
Nope, not really. I'm not the one asking dumbass questions on WSB.
It's called walgreens for a reason and not wallreds.
I use Tradingview and it is awesome a lot of thing to learn. Your tips will help. I will use them.

Mixed bag of calls, mostly fucked.  Trying to buy some dips but never get enough positive movement in between to break out and stay green before it recedes again
Can't think of more appropriate Christmas gift for **2020** than my portfolio being wiped out. Fuck you
I think it could go to 40$ easily by early 2021 abd possibly higher over next year depending on paramount plus launch is received. They have a lot of content In production, like Disney we don’t know what and I expect a lot of the news will be about the future content and international expansion. They saw the Disney play book and have time to refine some of their decisions to be more in line with franchise development and value creation for shareholders. I am very bullish on the future for VIAC

Who the fuck is selling BABA?? Buncha retards, institutional investors see value at this price point. Paper handed fucks
Sir, this is a methadone clinic.
Algotrading on WSB? Nice
If Cohen takes over as CEO i will definitely hold long. Current market cap is only 1B. If this thing pivots and becomes profitable again why not 5 or 10B market cap? Fucking NKLA still has a market cap of 5B. NKLA!

Honey! Fetch me my bathing toaster!

All of a sudden China cares about ethics. Communist fucks
Hoping PLTR ends at $28, just to see if the CC I sold get exercised.
How is buying a stock not manipulation? You "borrow" a couple million dollars and then flood the queue with market orders, driving the price up?
I did that but the dip wasn't coming so I went closer to the ask to actually get the trade to execute

I'm sure it's possible the dip will still come and I'll be down a little bit at the end of the day before holding over the weekend for my gains, it's just annoying how Robinhood's not good with numbers when it has one job
In detroit?
Thank you and you’re welcome.
Next week and January is about to be straight fuckin green after today’s bullshit
My portfolio went to a sea of red with a few green islands in the last 20 mins
You have to loose another 1.02$..do it right man
FCEL primes for a nice rally any minute now 🚀🚀🚀
It's finally COSTs time to shine. $400 by end of Jan no problem
Lol this guy keeps tryna pump this
Merry Christmas bro nice gains!
Not sure if STICk in the mud or if it’ll actually run up
this stock going down to $12-14 where it will stay for the next year

No it’s down because the whole market is sucking dick right now
[removed]
baba 300 june leaps?
You too man, lets hope our diamond hands will be rewarded
You could but this is gonna be a creep upwards towards earnings and then kaboom. So if you can catch a day with a drop then good on you- just don’t plan around waiting for it to happen.
Go back to rep sneakers noob
[deleted]
At this rate BABA gonna drill all the way back to GYNA
I will, but not today probably
Rich people have it so easy. 15%is 200k for them lmao. In this market yall can buy any stock and get the same return in a month or two. Where would the retard boomers be without reddit telling them not to buy GE
PUTS on BABA until $0
Lost 75% of my account in one week :)
WTF   V U Z I?!
I thought so. It's cheap AF on a relative basis. It's around 1x topline. 

If you look at some companies like CELH trading at 25x sales and GLUC at over 50x sales.
They do the same thing in my experience— lose you money.
This is the lowest pltr will be in the next 3 months. Don't lose faith
[deleted]
Got in on the little dip now. 2/19/21 $105c
r/gaybears
Holy fuck that baba rug pull
Ban
Xmas sell off? :(((
We’re all just looking for confirmation bias
NET and GRWG saving me from a red day
Jk I don’t spam. I just have most my moneys in AAPL lmao
I’m gonna double down on this dip for my 1/15 VALE calls 🚀🚀🚀
Don’t markets always go red on Christmas???
Random massive red candle
Anyone bearish on zoom
210 is fine. If that’s the downside
They will be worth as much as Tesla if not more soon. Bigger cars = bigger market cap
Holy shit, baba just keeps going lower
I just bought BABA 1/15/21 165c and I’m a mega autust. So this might just be retarded enough to print
Someone needs to take the eggnog and rum away.
Guh
So is BABA trying to set a record? All the way to zero today?
[removed]
MM pulling the rug profit taking ...buy the dip it’s coming fast
Lol he must be making money and you ain’t 😂
STOP THE COUNT
Eat my dongus you fuckin nerd.

and PLTR
I'm feeling very STICky lads 😩
Isn’t the vote Monday .?
at least April - you want to capture the Q4 earnings date and shareholder meeting in your window
Just so you know, snowflakes will fall across your RH app on Xmas day.

Just like our memefolios
I have mostly leaps but threw in a few of those same 12/31s, fingers crossed for a christmas miracle next week!
Literally just fuck these random quick sell offs man so frustrating
Bid and ask

+ place limit order for the bid price

+ wait for the dip

+ bid price will always be lower than the average price
Baba come on this is a bit exaggerated
What if this is the peak? 😂
You at 1,669,420.69 yet?
She can seize my means of production.
should've exited CRSR when i had the chance now this shit is going back to 30 again
we all know Cathie buyin the fk outta BABA right now
[deleted]
Thanks for sharing. Is this your own version of a backtester?
I'm sitting on a handful of 40c's for 1/8
This market 🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
Limp Weener Energy all week 😑
I fomo’ din not sure if I should sell or will actually run higher
Same people who are calling PLTR a scam stock and shit were also laughing at GME after earnings by the way. Imagine getting baited into selling by them.
Pussied out at the top today after being negative this morning on my calls expiring today. What can I say?😅
When is my stimi check hitting my bank account
Santa wtf is this
Damn I am a paperhands bitch today. I sold my NET calls I bought yesterday for 30% profit when it hit 85.50 this morning...
Because Ma is playing with fire and about to mysteriously disappear or something.
Upvote for cutting losses downvote for diamond hands
Happy Holidays everyone. Its been a hell of a year on this sub and wish nothing but the best for you all, in and out of your trades.
I'm all in on Palantir, SmileDirectClub, and a mix of tourism stocks.
I’d wish you good luck but I’m rooting for NKLA to hit $0 where it belongs, so bad luck
What happened?
QS just grow already
Not the end yet. Dump b4 Xmas coming. 210 may happen
Buy the dip on BABA??
Someone please stop BABA
Yeah the CCP is literally sterilizing thousands of Muslims a day and people are like “they won’t let BABA fail” 😂😂
Doesn't matter, morons across the world will still continue to invest in China while they do whatever the fuck they want. Chinese leaders are complete P.O.S.', I'm surprised people haven't figured this out yet.
So sorry bud. EV is a tough market. I mean, really tough. Everything is jumping in now as all tech is maxed out. 

Were you looking short or long hold?
Bruh you don't buy puts when it's going down. That's FOMO, and that's bad trading. It will go down in the future, which is why you buy puts. 

Listen to me or don't, I don't care. It's just a gift.
W recovery 👏
Buy the palantir dip!
God that wood gives me wood sheesh 😓
Lmao i remember when people in here called 280 the bottom on BABA...what a journey
Just another day of PLTR bleeding me dry.  I hate this POS
Fuck thats a lot of words
Red day b4 christmas. This sucks
Wtf happened to it? Got wrecked
BABA and SQ better fucking be green next week. Merry Christmas retards.
christmas is cancel

$BB
Oh lord... 🤦‍♂️
How far out GME calls?
i want it to $25 then ill buy more
Rally time. Bought the dip
Just closed out my covered calls on mvis holding shares very happy. This is going to continue to leg up over the course of the days, get in now guys prime oppurtunity
$DEEZ $NUTS , Great tickets for the new year
Not at this rate seems like it’s already happened
I already paperhanded mine for a small loss
Shut the fuck up
Was literally the perfect theta play 😫
It fought on that $220 hill and that's where it died.

I'm predicting -20% by end of day.
Sitting on 3k shares @ $1.7 probably consolidate at 3$
Rip
Done holding CRM fuck that shit
If apple doesn’t drop $2 I’m done. If it does drop I’m gonna have a lot of money. Merry Christmas everyone
Aaaaaaand here we fucking go again

Can’t have shit in Detroit
I’d accept “in-kind” stimulus from AOC, if you know what I mean 😏👌
I bet she gobbles up a bunch more the. All the 🤡 here see she did and fomo when it’s 80% recovered
GAME UK will want words..
Buy $300 worth of books on being a man
His dick is probably and innie
Lmao. Now what do we do xD
+1 for creativity
Ford? Just say it bro we are modless now
I know of a big group of very successful day traders who say that 215 is a goal but might be unlikely
PLTR
🤡
3 though...
I can't possible predict, but if you were confident enough to buy a leap, and you had a decent entry on it, then don't worry 

Close your app, walk away, enjoy the Xmas week my dude, don't get caught up in the manic WSB energy, most of the people screaming here have OTM weeklies
Just fucking bleed and hit bottom already. BABA dragging my boy NIO down for no good reason at all.
Thats what I assumed with having far ITM debit spreads but just wanted to make sure. Thanks!
All my coworker talks to me about is stocks and honestly it’s fucking annoying people start trading and it becomes their personality trait
Willing to go all in at baba 150
What a colossal retarded cuck. Fuck you
amd or sne are guaranteed and pretty safe gains cause of their upcoming ER
I see this as a win, boomers never sell
That’s banking on something insane happening I stopped buying puts election week when we almost had a civil war and the market rallied 🤡
Timed the top perfectly on TSLA. Hoping it dips some more so I can buy back in.
There’s a retard filter at the entrance. Only lets retards in.
I just look at what PLTR does every day, shake my head and laugh like a lunatic.
God damn it PLTR y u do dis
What’s the next play? Boxing Day sales? Amazon calls?
Right. Support is at $210 and then at $200.
I have both and NBAC
dammit PLTR, find the floor
Pleas fly again
I got in yesterday before close and out this AM
I’m thinking about it. How low is the dip going to go?
FUBO calls at close for that dead cat? Am i crazy?
Merry Christmas, I guess
BABA makes me so fucking pissed. Every time I say it can’t get lower it does.

Sorry to whoever saw my FSR and PLUG comment a few minutes ago and bought in
Oil stocks and QQQ practically have an inverse relationship, so if you want to short tech, long oil
Anyone bagholding FUBO? I completely missed the 60 boat after I dozed off and now paying the god damn price.
I’m holding 12/31 as well. Good luck. I agreed. I’d double down if I could.
Just bout tsla 12/31 670c, am I stupid ?
PLTR GANG TO THE MOON 🌕🌙
Bro I had 34c 12/31 and sold it at 1.19 it’s now 19.50.  I need to stop being a bitch
Prepare your assholes, this is gonna hurt
MM think of the children!!!
scrooge has come for the turkey
Baby girl Cathie 🥺
Tesla shareholders will never sell that stock. Godamn I should probably buy it again, $2800 higher
I mean the funny thing is they’ve already been selling games online for years and years. I guess a new website wouldn’t hurt because the current one isn’t great. But I have no idea what people think is going to happen to fundamentally transform this business to give it an edge over Amazon.

That said, I’m up about 50% on my shares and just made 800% on a call yesterday so... 🤷🏼‍♂️
Should I buy the SQ dip? Think it's down due to the rumors of SQ buying Tidal, but that seems like such a stupid decision, there's no way they're serious
Baba
If 660 falls I'll paper hand this bitch
What is **LUV**?

Managing to escape margin call by the skin of my teeth today.
I lost 1000, my day is entirely red
From 490 to the 3.2k back to 500 it’s been a fun month.. at most I pulled out 650 gonna take this last 500 to Vegas 🤙🤙🤙 see you when the stimmy hits and PLTR is 35 mid jan
Expiration is weeks from now. Don't be weak.
I think it's because the pump yesterday was from an updated price target and not anything tangible.
Products and revenue are bearish
SOLO on the next dip
Please Jack, do something. I’ve been loyal to you since 30 mins ago. Don’t let me down.
This day turning big gay
Markets just a punching bag today huh
But it’s going up...
I hope you get coal coated in dog shit
Sorry to hear that. I would say if you are willing to average down that can be a good idea. Otherwise just wait a few weeks to see how things go. After all, it's only a loss if you sell at a loss
Pltr guh
Dipping now, how low will it go?
He was asking about STIC.  He should have taken STIC profits already.
Pretty boring day tbh bout to log off and go do some last minute shopping. How tf is it already 11:00?
it was just up 25% and now theres no news its cooling off
As of this writing TSLA is worth more than BABA. lmao.

The amazon of China is worth less than TSLA. crazy times!
I’m converting my 401k to be all SPACs. It’s literally if free money and can’t go tits up.
Already really high at the moment.
An anatomically incorrect position
But my quant, Yang, is all over it.
Wrong way elon
Maybe who knows. No one can predict future.
This has to be the market top
It went 90% and you’re like wHy DoEs iT KeEp DroOopINg
Fuck everything
Bruh Baba is extinct. What the hell.
No. Earnings were literally  better than expected. If you can’t get a basic fact like that right, you’re not worth talking to.  
“ The company’s adjusted earnings per share were a loss of 53 cents per share, which beat estimates of a loss of 85 cents per share.”

Noooooooooo
China is going to organ harvest Jack Ma and take his big head
What hes saying is you should sell bc no extra retards will pump this crap for you even if you post it. You can be a pig tho and get slaughtered next year. Keep us updated retard

What if I have calls though
Rips up close to 100%, fine. 

-10% ???
We’re all going to have to come to terms with the fact that BLNK will eventually get to 182.
Thanks wiseman for following the Northern Star! At the end, there were dog toys cradled in a box, bringing joy for those who stayed up late AH to wait for Santa. It’s a Christmas miracle!
But thanks homie. Merry Christmas! (If that’s your thing)

I stopped trying to learn to read at point 4. Just gonna put all my money in RYCEY
No
GME is a boomer stock now
fax we recover by 1pm guarantee
Just when u think boom 🤯 210
So why did baba die again?
Jesus.  Your wife's boyfriend must even have a boyfriend.  Hail daddy longballs
Would someone mind explaining how warrants will work on RobinHood? Are we able to buy at 23, sell at 23, or what?
Bought the FCEL dip. Now i wait for the Santa Clause Rally 🙏🏻🚀🚀🚀
BABA gonna slowly bleed to $200 hol li shyt
So I guess the next step is they use their own software to figure out how to get more money out of their own clients? 🚀🚀🚀
Tesla puts, right now, are free money.

That's my Christmas gift to you all.

Merry Christmas 🎄🎄🎄
Today but look at their charts over the last week!

Edit month. They’re like inverse
anyone else still looking at rolls royce?  i feel like this is bottom, but who knows.
Looks like MMs are finally cashing out to buy their hookers coke and condoms for Christmas
THCB (Microvast)
That’s the goal 😎Just bought shares at the dip
GME seems risky getting in now, I’ve been fucked by it before
you would short a meme stock?
why are people buying BLNK when SBE (chargepoint) will be so much better after the SPAC merger
Amzn and aapl pod racing rn
Suck my yule log Xi!  😡
I’m with you.
oh you'll get it back, probably not what you put in though
Cathie will load up on BABA today
Yeah that position isn’t for me. If she doesn’t know how to do it right and leans forward too much it just hurts.
It had a short report on it, so it's getting murdered. 

If this stock is like any other that's had a hit piece out on it, it's going to rebound shortly. I doubled my position for the rebound.
fuckkkk
“The Stock Companies”. You belong here.
Yoloing my Christmas bonus on gme 0days.  My kids already got gifts on top of already having everything they can ever want.  Can Santa deliver for me?  I'd like more than a new pair of pj's this year.
Yes but idk what day I 3rd week of Jan but don't quote me on that
LAme
Nooooooo
Absolutely
PLTR and hack
It do be like that
PLTR drained my entire account 😔
Sir, this is a casino.
that seems unrealistic, brontosaur bones are super dense, maybe ever stronger than antler.
Everybody FOMO into AMD so my calls and shares can print 😔
BABA $235c 12/31
I'd like to know!
u must not understand how she trades. she will be double down until this shit hits the bottom.
Markets can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent. I don’t plan on holding this as a long term investment, but I’d be leaving a lot of steak on the bones if I sold now IMO. Price action looks too good.
Already in
What is your play?
I doubt bleeding. I think it will recover slowly. It’s around the support line too.. I mean if it breaks down it’s done tho..
I thought XL was the chosen one.
Short wankers
CRWD killing me
https://twitter.com/RocketManGuyMan/status/1340741894184161280?s=09
HAHAHA join the club, I was done with it yesterday
I don’t see BABA getting much lower than this
BLNK had quite a pop. Puts on BLNK?
They really made a Brexit deal?
He's probally got a ton of doners vested in anit Marijuana

Okay just did it when it dipped
Yes but still need to be careful about buy in price
360P SPY
Triple pay and I’m in!
Let's destroy investor confidence in our companies so we can fuck over one person in particular. That'll show him 🤡
Currently in STLD, done nothing but drill so far :(

Despite good news and rumors, what gives?
No lol
Anyone holding through the long holiday weekend?
since when does revenue affect stock price
that's a weird expiry with lower volume calls atm. So every time orders flow your brokerage will get weird with what they show as your net liquidating value. Check the bid-ask on those strikes, it's probably wide as fuck
Should I buy the alibaba dip?
Buying the BABA dip
 Hopefully China's actions aren't too harsh.
I know it's all fun and memes, but there's some good shit here, appreciate it boss

I think the bit about having spare cash is a good highlight: imo it's fine to gamble sometimes, with money you can afford to lose (especially in a fed endorsed party) but quality really did go on firesale a couple of times over the course of this crazy bull run
SPAC are free money rn like it or not
SPWR FLYINGGGGGG
You and me both. Bleeding here
Baba taking a massive dump
BABA 240C for March guaranteed $$$?
Nope, the ticker will eventually be banned
Not yet, spent all morning panic buying
How is shorting a stock not manipulation ? You “borrow” a couple million shares and then dump them flooding the que and then driving the price down? 

Am I missing something here?
He prefers cocaine
I bought just cuz of meme potential. Not expecting it to pop off tho
[removed]
[removed]
Shares? I thought this was an options group
Yeah I thought that as I typed it lmao
Why does XL keep dropping?
Are we expecting a sell off at close again ?
Yea even if there is reason on our side(the stock is easily worth 300) the mainland doesn't give a fuck. The CCP will do as they please. Cant bet on China tbh
All these paper handed bitches gonna help us fly 🚀🛸
I got Jan 15s close enough for the news cycle to start buzzing about it alreast
That fucker is dying in its $220 hill.

-20% by end of day.
Debit spreads can be priced fuckily until you get closer to expiration.  It should be at max gain, and will be very green, but you won’t see all of that until you’re closer to expiration.
Upvote if we should stand back & stand by on buying the BABA dip
BLNK in dis bitch
You know it’s bad when ARK and is red
It was supposed to be a white Christmas but now, just brown and sad.
GME
If SPY really dumps right after I sell my 368Ps for a huge loss I’m going to lose my mind
If you still haven’t learned your lesson with these Chinese stocks you kind of deserve it

Doesn't BLNK look really overbought right now?
All I want for Xmas is a five figure day. Come on 🥭 sign the stimmy
I'm not touching spacs over $11. There's still plenty out there 9-10.50 range awaiting their turn
This is to remind me to check this out when I am not at work.
given the year thats shockingly good.
Broooo
Fuck me I bought $23 0DTE feye puts at .14 and solder .33 this morning... now they’re worth 100 a piece
Nobody tell him
I just bought feb ARKK calls, so I'm not worried. Just need 2 solid weeks from her and I'll eat plenty good.
Amzn options are retarded why am I in there
Well me neither. But thats why Ryan is a billionaire and I'm not. I'm betting on him knowing how to, not me. Company culture can be changed under the right leadership. If Jeff Amazon was announced as the new CEO would you invest?
Same legit fuck this stock
No.
lol at people getting suckered into that STIC pump
Honda calls would be a good bet right now if you want a way out of the hole you're in. I'm here for you buddy there's no shame being where we're at
Just lost 700 on weekly 🤡
Nah I’m totally fine throwing it out as a gamble. That’s why I’m here lol
BABA just wants to get back home to China so it's gotta keep drilling
Yeah, not very cash money at all... 😒
I am so sick of Amazon’s bullshit
I recall something about Amazon facing similar enquiries by Congress sometime back about monopolies? But they didn't breach the Consumer Welfare Act so nothing Congress could do then.
you dont get any votes for calls
I’ve constantly lost 1300 every day this week so far
Oh man this comment is gold. You belong here
Love STLD
Someone smart give me a end of year yolo.
Fuckin a man
Wow, what a week. This Santa rally has been great. 😩💦
Come on Elon 700 eod pls 🥲
GameStop needs to announce their EV
Whichever one of you said in premarket yesterday "buy the MVIS dip, you can send me a tip later". Heres a tip, you are a fucking retard.
Done with options, SPAC’s only
I’m starting to think some of you guys have a charity etf or something with how much you guys mention it. I know we’re retarded here but nonprofit doesn’t mean they don’t make a profit, it just means they balance out the books by paying execs and shit. You guys are so retarded you actually give your money away to these big charities?
Vldr ran up 50% mon/tues. anyone that bought after that had it coming.
Well when Santa is high on cocaine driving the train to 375 he kinda forget about Christmas and to bring the rally with em
The market reminds me of that one time I was fucking this girl reverse cow girl and it felt like my dick broke. She said “other guys like it when I do it this way.” Other guys like their dicks being broken?
Do you think it will continue?  I planned to trim this week so I closed all short term positions but some of my leaps getting shanked hard
Fuck this CRM lol, I will move to meme stocks again now
Should I hold these XL bags till Monday?
join the not valued at 3200 with no split in sight gang.
Last 30mins of trading day fren.
BUY THIS NVTA DIP
I was doing good last week, took losses this one for being impacient trying to “day trade”. Never again, only betting on “sure” things from now on
Fuck bro. I’d say GME, that thang is moving. I’m not invested though.
I do think there is a play here. They can't just liquidate it overnight. Might be some bleeding until the new year and then a rebound play
[deleted]
Pleas dump so we can fly again
Panic buy
Glad I dumped that shit stain of a stock that is PLTR
Plug is going to go off.
Cathy woods bought baba before this. She is retarded
BABA triple bottom
Selling volume is off the chart but price goes up. How is that possible?
Thoughts on stld? It’s done nothing but drill since I bought calls
I hope bears are eating cause there better be no complaints if we green next week

Edit: when we green next week
Nice!! Learning every day dude will help you so much in the long game for big tendies
[deleted]
Fucking XL what the fuck
This is the best GME dip were getting.

Don't fuck it up because it's a short day.
If you show up with that sweater working in top IB in London/NY and not get fired the same day you get serious talk with manager and MDs think you are complete dement, bro
Look how they massacred my boy baba
That happened to me after September. Had so many small but good green days then boom -10% in 3 days
How the fuck is SOLO green and GOEV -1.58?
[deleted]
They don't until they do. I made 8.5k on June 10-11 when the spy dropped 6% I made 2.5k a month ago when spy gapped up over no news. Or the usual news of stimmy going well
[deleted]
are we still buying MVIS.  would like to add this to my list of meme stocks
Arnold Schwarzenegger’s is pretty good.
I now understand you aren’t but the way you worded it does imply that, hence the downvotes
Their earnings were literally worse than expected lol.

The primary problem is that they offered literally nothing as to why the hell anybody would go there over: Amazon, Target, Walmart. 

I'm actually making a fair chunk of change on TSLA IV crush right now though so that's working out. Banks printed this week as well.
Important to note that forced margin calls only happen after 13 full days on the list. Today is day 13, but based on the volume so far it's likely that it won't make the list since all necessary securities should be able to clear today. Volume has to shoot up (maybe a last-hour spike) to get on for a 13th day and force these margin calls.
You into music? A lot of good ones from rock and roll artists from the 60s and 70s. Loved Claptons and Gregg Allman's  but there are plenty of other good ones as well
gj you bought high
I'll add that to the card I send him on valentine's day
GME is just getting started. Let's not kid ourselves because some of the stimulus money is going into trickle into GME.
How much more can BLNK really rip?
Just checked Iborrowdesk. Shorts are trying to short it hard
That’s why I ain’t trading today lol
Only if you owned TSLA.
red day
Down a cool 6k today. Merry Christmas to me
So its cool to have extra chromosomes in the 2020s
No. Next real bottom is $16-$17. Then we'll ride to $25. Rinse and repeat, new higher lows until March. Buy the dips, sell the rips
Daddy needs stimmy to make some degenerate calls
"buy high and sell low" is just a silly may may, not an investing strategy.
It’s a longer term hold but we’re setting up for a nice lift off if we can break 30-31
You know they aren’t actually selling anything until 2022 right?  That said, I was in early and will be holding long term I love their products and business model and so does their partner Hyundai.
Can someone tell me the meat on FCEL looks like it’s in a fat dip should I hop in?
CCP gonna buy back shares slowly over time. They do care cuz it is a money maker. Just saying.
Man, I don’t like people losing money, but I will admit I’ll laugh when this drops. I can’t believe there are people naive enough to think a company with $0 in revenue and 0 product until 2024 will stay at this level 😂
buy BABA 210$ puts? or sell
what’s the difference
We got a portfolio to burn

I think i've done maybe 5-6 trades based on DD on this sub and all of it went to shitter. 

But based on enthusiam and hopefully legit knowledge of the industry - gonna finally jump on this one, 25c 04/16. If this one doesnt pay off imma stop playing with options lol

loaded half shares half calls on the remainder of cash for the year
baba is going to crater from 1200-1300 today
No idea about that, yet.  I'm a value investor, mainly.
BABA up 2% on the year 😂
This is not how this was supposed to go

Except RIOT is only monthly options
Since when does China give a shit about monopolies? These retards fell out of line and have to be put in their place, that is all..
Seems like the damn alibaba thing is spilling into other Chinese stocks.
When you go all in, it's all stocks? No calls?
And if you order in the next minute, they’ll throw in a free $BIDU with your purchase.
you have less patience than my 6 year old. it's been consolidating and trending upwards for like 3 weeks, chill haha
Baba
FEYE with the Megagay smh.
FCEL.. can’t stress it enough
🙋🏽‍♂️
"And now we'll throw in an extra -5%, yours absolutely free!"
Isn’t there a NIO investor day next month
Fuck crm jesus
Baba 2022 January 220c's are pretty cheap
It’s ok. TSLA just reloading. 💎🖐💎🖐

Ma got the taste of ultimate power, going back to being a nobody is a no even with money.
After dropping down to $17/share today I think we’re fucked. At this point I’m just hoping it goes back up a little so my losses aren’t as bad.
I just need BABA at 225...
I just bought 500 more shares. No shit.
What part of diamond hands do you not understand.
I think I need that stimulus check more than ever now
Hopefully PLTR would fix that.
Guys, genuine question. I got some tesla debit spreads 640/645 exp jan. 29. I bought them when tesla was $622, on december 22. Now this spreads change from positive to negative 50 percent every second. Should I just leave them to expire or try to sell it? And shouldn't it be always green anyway? Thanks!
This is the answer. But yeah I’m stunned that people aren’t hopping all over it.. this is easy double bagger by Jan.
RIP Canoo
Shares
Who did this? lol
I don’t understand... but that’s ok more tendies for us 🤑🤑🤑
Lmfao

Gonna get out the holy water just in case. Cant have anything scaring my baby AP.XT
Welp- I sold BLNK too early. Sold 400x shares at 2.91 and closes Jan $10C in November… FML
I'd play Jan 22 expiry. You get the tail risk of 🥭 fucking with transition too
The steel industry does this every couple years to raise profits. They shut down some of their equipment, wait for prices to rise then turn it back on again. Don't buy in to this BS. Source: I work in industries that buy steel for the product we sell.

Just saying CCP prolly didn’t think that BABA gonna plunge with the antitrust investigation news cuz they didn’t see big drops from US scompanies when they announced the same thing. This means BABA gonna be bought at the dip and recover back to 250
switch to ToS, best customer service I've experienced in any industry
I bought 1 12/31/20 option based on this. We'll see how it plays out.

Always teasing us. Common already PLTR!
Not I. Just bought my first most expensive naked call 220c June 2022. Usually a spread guy, for days like these.
And miss out the weekly monday skyrocket after Friday dump? No thanks
Thinking of loading the boat on BABA shares at this level. $220 is more than 30% off ATH.
Check volume and the bid/ask spread
You are genuinely retarded and after reading this I may just be as well
BABA puts are up 15000%
God speed brother. Right there with you.

That's why I'm not rolling my 12/31 calls just yet. Technicals are set up nice, you can see the bull flags, the shorts don't have enough to keep a big rally down. I hope we finish above 21 even though shorts are trying desperately to keep it below 21

Grab them if you are retarded, this is classic China power struggle and will dip even lower when they announce the falsified charges once backroom talks breakdown again. BAT has nothing to fear because they already offload all their assets to oversea shell capitals, CCP has nothing to lose neither since they will keep fucking them until they take back control.

Car manufacturing is nothing like phones. 

This isn’t a new iPad, Apple TV, etc. 

They had started their Titan project, they then disbanded. They might focus on just the software and that’s getting crowded BB is in that too. 

Google bought Otto a while ago. Amazon bought Zoox  couple weeks ago ( failed start up). We’ll see when there is something. 

I still can’t see a single company that made this shift. Furthermore, Apple makes its money using slave labor in China, etc. that’s why they have high profit margins. 

Finally, take a look at Roku vs. AppleTV. Roku did not have the advantage of a massive echo system, developers, etc. they were launched around the same time (2007-2008). Roku has the most market share. AppleTV is not even #2. 

Feel free to cite examples. Downvoting is OK too.
I think it’ll struggle with 30 for a week or two before breaking out. I’ve been writing covered calls and am looking to stop when it starts testing 30.

I literally fuckinf hate sitting in Amazon calls while they die alll fucking day
Sad this all ends in 2 hours
Chill out people, lots of stocks are currently selling off.

People are taking EoY profits, trimming positions,  tax write-offs, etc.

It's after days like these that stocks will have random +5% days as people jump back in at a discount
And then you have -6% days like me today and wipe out months of your 0.18% days.
Everyone who said 220 was the BABA bottom .. fuck you
Soon $TSLA will be worth more than $BABA 😄 🤣
You trying to get BABA holders to be even more depressed? Not cool man.

imagine falling for a coordinated WSB pump n dump
Retarded. I'd buy muchhhhh further out if you are thinking about calls.
Buy low sell high
I'm buying more when my deposit clears. It's looking like Monday at this rate.
The CCP would love nothing more to show they can and will end anyone—even someone as powerful and respected as Ma—who would dare make a remark even remotely critical of the government.

“Mr Ma’s offending words were delivered in a speech to a high-level forum on October 24. He criticised China’s regulators and accused its banks, most of which are state-owned, of having a ‘pawnshop mentality’ that requires collateral and guarantees to extend credit. What the world’s second-largest economy really needs, he argued, is bold new players that can extend credit to the collateral-poor. He went on to claim that innovative companies and individuals are often shunned by China’s big financial groups.” https://www.ft.com/content/3d2f174d-aa73-44fc-8c90-45c2a554e97b

This kind of political risk on steroids is why extra caution is warranted when it comes to Chinese companies and stocks.

Not a good day for LAZR, VLDR or MVIS
Wait till the bottom shows itself. Never a good idea to buy on a decline. It’s heading to 260

Make it so.
Paper hands, unfortunately I sold for a loss before too and missed out on huge gains.
No stock is fundamental we are in lala land
Lol @ dude calling STIC a pump and dump 

am thinking he couldn’t get in under $16 and is now too cheap to get in over $18 😂😂
Yes
I got fucking rolled
No, actually I only bought for the day trade because of RS news, bought at 0.33 rode the high of yesterday rode it back down and sold for a 100 dollar gain. Then tried getting in today at 0.77 and sold for 0.53, is what it is
How tf is BLNK outperforming SBE?
Nice. Honestly tho, congrats on your play and Merry Christmas!
tldr: yolo your life savings on the next biggest play for easy profit
TSLA new ath by 12!!!
same exact for me
Mods are big ga y. If you say z j z you get flagged for spam by automod. Big gay. Big if true.
It will Melvin fucking around and being a bitch
They said that when it hit 270 too
If china really does pursue antitrust against them, this could just be the beginning. I personally would wait a little while. Dont see it rebounding magically any time soon
> worse than expected earnings
 
No. Earnings were better than expected. 
 
> increased store closures
 
Which is a basic part of the turnaround playbook. You close underperforming stores so you can focus more resources on the ones that are profitable. 
 
> Filed for a 100M shelf offering which they will surely be using soon
 
Why will they surely be using it soon? On the tail of share buybacks when the company has plenty of money? They won’t. It’s a poison pill to defend against RC taking over. A weak one. 
 
 
I get it. You don’t actually want to know why it’s a good buy. Go back to losing money on Tesla.
good point. i stand corrected. fuck Bitch McTurtle

Baba will drop to 215. Easiest puts ive ever bought

BABA might go below 200 in the next few weeks. pretty sure the chinese govt already knew about their anti-competitive practices but they turned a blind eye.
They’ll just insert another company to take BABAs place. The CCP doesn’t give a fuck

It's already failed?! This means we are now stuck with 600 right

I’m with you dude, put in 300$ 5 mins ago
Its never good news when a communist country investigates you for being a monopoly. I mean, communism is basically a monopoly for government.
Don’t worry GME call holders, the more shit I talk about it, the more it will go up. Anyways... GME DUMP EOD GONNA BE EPIC LOL
I almost did that exact thing yesterday, but ended up holding thru
right, right....but does PLTR break 30?
SPY is tricky shit
If aapl could hit 135 that would be great

[deleted]
My question: buy the 50 call in 2023 for $1000 or buy $1000 worth of shares?
i like how PDD is up bigly cuz of BABA
This is normal, Idk why people take profit for only a few dollars when you look at what kind of company it is and where it’s at now, you know it’s gonna be atleast 20 dollars more than what it is now.
Jusdiditthanks
Baba, pleas fly again.
It's not eoy it's 12/24
Doing lotto VXX calls because no way some crazy retard shit doesn't happen in the next two weeks
I’m trying to get good price on baba but no make sense. Why so expensive for 5% otm
Cult vibes for sure. Massive echo chamber
Fake, ban
Oc GN with profit-taking
They won’t dismantle it, but they don’t have to in order to prove the point.

Markets hate uncertainty. All the CCP has to do is let this twist in the wind and keep people guessing and Ma (and the stock...) will suffer for it.

They won’t give BABA the death penalty but we don’t know the length of the jail sentence.
You sure could do that. If you want to basically “put it on black” you could buy a handful of SPY 12/31 368c. If you want to be a maniac you’d put it on TSLA 660c 12/31
between that and theta they just wont stop fucking dropping. Spy been the same fucking price for a fucking month
So we leapin' BABA right?
Christmas 2021 is on Big Poppa Vito. Thanks for the stacks daddio.
Welcome to the gang gang gang.
Imagine imagining
SPY tryna break even on TSLA 😂

It's 2020 and You white devil don't understand communism dd. Xi is just the representative. Communism is the power. Ain't it obv already baba is monopoly. I'm long on Jacky Chan

Imagine being a GOEV bag holder. Yeah that’s me.
Bout time we have someone help us rather than just showing their fucking wins.

Thank you for giving us good content.

Just googled per your recommendation and I'm adding to my existing positions. Thanks!
Just ring the fucking bell
Yeah. Honestly I sold. Might as well offset some gains at this point in the year...
They’re getting ready to dump it, I’m thinking...
[deleted]
LMAO I sold my BLNK calls at breakeven bc it was trading sideways for a bit there, and then boom it starts the next leg up to 53
Mine are dead. No point in selling, hoping I can get some back Monday, but 12/31 is dead. Bought a Jun and a LEAP while holding back tears :,(
Going sideways after dropping that much is the first step of a bottom. So you can technically just buy around here with a stop loss under the little channel that it created. 

Personally, I have my first buy order around 210 but I'm playing catch the falling knife.
Nvda, CRM, Amazon boring as fuck
Barring a huge collapse I’ll hold. I got in on my 665c for .92 so no reason not to hold. For you depends on how much you paid per contract and how muxh risk you want to take.
I was told GME would be at 30 EOY
[deleted]
Good bot
I get the feeling  g m e  is about to 🚀🚀🚀 into the close.
Honestly, good luck, I hope they end up ITM. I'd gladly take a 12.5% return on my purchase in 7 days.
For those who keep buying baba and it keeps dipping... you get what you fucking deserve! - joker voice
I grabbed em
Good news, only down 34k on my naked BABA puts before i bought back
TSLA making the index boomers rich
fair enough, I don't have those diamond hands.
Looks neat will check out

Edit typo
BABA is actually making a fool outta me. This stock is fundamentally not worth 218 USD dollars
june 25 calls are pretty safe, i would put some in april calls as well
Worth it perhaps. Will be interesting to see how it trades when everyone returns for new years.

Feb calls might be better though. Or at least buy debit spreads like 240/250C
If you can't say fuck (in a non sexual connotation) in front of an HR person, you're working in the wrong place, Bro.
Pleas fly again guy definitely just lost 50k on pinterest today
Thanks BABA. Now I know what it feels like to live in a communist Country
I mean the bigger picture of investment into the entire country of china.
I'm still bullish but god damn its frustrating waiting on it. Thinking of opening some ITM debit spreads just to make sure I still get paid if it stays level
it wont go fly again without correction
TL;DR how do I make money
Drill team six incoming in the south southeast sector on GME, over.

Roger that.
This tracks from what I've been hearing. I'm invested in a company that uses steel and while we're set for strong orders,  the price of steel is bonkers and orders books are pretty much full for the first quarter. We've also heard strong demand from China and international steel is no longer that much cheaper than domestic. You can see the CRU index prices go up,  and the longer dated contracts go up as well. One question,  why $MT versus other steel operations?
Jan 9th.
No. You fomo’ed.
Kinda want to grab some yolo calls on BABA even though I hate everything Chinese
Thing ain’t gonna test 225 most likely
It's too late to buy tesla fatties. Leave it. Go PLTR if you have balls or AAPL if you have soft cock syndrome

Is GME done with upside or can go up?
Drill Team 6 has commandeered PLTR
Gme $21c 12/31??
PLUG CALLS
When tepper sold some of his shares in November it was a sign
I didn’t read any of this.
More likely it trades flat at 664 to cuck everyone

Correction 665 was the sell off .... and it’s gone.
Fucking christ MVIS should I get out now or hold in hopes of magic carpet rides?
Look at the volume on the puts and the return whoever bought was lucky
Ok Melvin...
Gonna be a long two hours watching it
[removed]
Still profiting lmao how's shorting at 16 you homeless fucks
Someone who watches TSLA often. Do I sell my 650c expiring today or hold this shit to the end?
Buy super OTM SPY 0DTE contracts to the tune of 2k. Not difficult.
BABA if you ever want to do the "be greedy when others are fearful and cower". Today is a day. This is Spartaaaaaa.
That’s what it do.
with this news i wouldnt reccomend it. this will ripple for at least a few weeks. so that call will probably expire worthless.
MT 12/31 25c gonna expire worthless.

Please Close The Market
Green dildo
Investors finally tried Salesforce and realized its an ass system
GME and PLTR you were my most favoured retarded children, but a few weeks back I found a new child wandering the streets and decided to adopt it for a bit, it's name is BLNK - it is so retarded, it really does not know which direction it is going, it tries new things every day, I think I love it.
Sold 20% of my position when it hit 20, letting the rest ride to the moon
It's near its covid low now you don't think they haven't  already scared the vejesus out of investment?
Autocorrection got me
I love how when you got banned the stock dropped a bunch and now you're unbanned it's back up soaring. I shouldn't have sold at $17:50...
should i let my apple covered calls be executed? this thing should dip back under $130 right?
CRSR needs to go back to $50 again
I love shopping calls
Do a 2k ish value spread that will never fucking hit. On AMZN or something
Please pray for my baba 12/31 calls
Wasnt always like that. I bought one in 2013 and the forums used to be civil.
I love how much REEEEEEEEEEE ya'll have on .10% candles Christmas Eve.
I may have bought one of those
I just buy calls on red days (have a lot of shares ~30 something basis) and it’s worked like 80% of the time
Wow! I thought the drop from $310 to $270 would be as clear a sign as any to jump ship and never look back.
I am really starting to hate CRM
Congrats! I was there once. Then it drove straight down.
Cohen will probably be happy receiving this as anyone would be happy when you receive a Xmas love letter from an autistic boy.

However, these autistic boys hold more than 5% of his company and fully support his takeover
Should have taken them already tard
That's why he did what he did
Basically you just went cliff diving but there is no water to land in.
I mean kind of, but it also makes your post go from "WOW INCREDIBLE LUCK!!" to "oh, another bull making 100-200% in a massive bull market using calls for leverage"

I fuckin knew it hahaha having seen similar behavior on my own chart after I withdrew
If TSLA busts through 665 we're mooning boi
No logos, only tickers. Tickers can’t be trademarked.
Gotta start somewhere. Congrats.
Merry Christmas assholes!
yeah i know, just saying it for the other autists that might join aboard so late... it all went up based on a rumor they would cooperate with apple
When Xi gives BABA his blessing do you think it will just gap up 30% overnight or will it be a slow and steady thing?
I feel like the fact that the CCP can come in and shut them down, or take them over, or do anything they want anytime they want, puts a cap on their value. But I'm an idiot. Probably smart to buy deep otm calls.
Buy $TSLA fractions near EOD so you can $ROPE on Monday
If you're not buying call options in BLNK, you have to ask "what am I doing with my life?" Room for MORE upside exists
What is going to lead the Santa rally? My money is on STZ, BBBY, and MU for earnings run ups for the start of the year. All consolidating.
fcell in beginning stages of its daily rip!!
Lots of foreclosures hitting the market?
Well, it can dump by 5% and I'll be fine. Or it can rise and I'll get exercised for profit. Or it can dump further and I can continue lowering my cost basis using covered calls.
Lol stop buying FDs if you can’t take the heat
Oh also bc of you I bought $20000 of MT 🙏🏻
Here it comes. Its dropped and gonna keep dropping. Glad the gay bear above you got his chance to save some face and sell at a lesser loss. Thanks for your on sale shares gay dude. Go into your tax doing hibernation until your 9-5 that treats you like shit sends you your less than enough W-2 in March
If you're autistic and you know it clap your hands
Wait for it to test 225 again, if it holds I’d buy, if it doesn’t it’ll likely go lower.
$279 seems so far away. sigh.
VXX turn around?
For all you retards that need to hear this, do not let the MM's and Algos win, buy the BABA dips. HODOR.
Microvision can lidar my nutsack
&#x200B;

yeah maybe, but they totally fuck all options holders.
 Nah dude more like your fucked you fucking jabroni why even speak
We need Santa to bring us $700 EOD under the tree
Call credit spread on tesla
Just playing one meme, or former meme, from now on TSLA.
with your brokerage?
I still don't understand
Those fucks don’t take vacations lmao, they’re always trading while their wives boyfriends take their families on vacation
Ok seems like a good move. Hopefully it doesn’t go down too much..
Got a bunch of March 19 calls, hopefully I earn some money, I’m currently down but as you’ve stated you believe it’ll pick up close to q1 earnings
That’s the spirit!
Sounds like your mom needs some bwc

Oh shit, I think STIC is making another run at it!!!
🚀🚀🚀
I just need gold to make a quick $10 down and then I don’t mess with it again
I-V-R. Calls were up real nice and meant to close them and instead bought the same amount I had and then BANG... whole thing went to shit.

Also lost a grip to TNKR. Fuck that gang.
Definitely
Is CRM just not going to go up anymore because of Slack? This is frustrating
Hold all year free ten bagger
I flip calls non-stop. Would not short.

What would you guys think of buying BABA 1/15/21 $250c’s right now? 

I know it *sounds retarded* and it *is retarded* but the calls are so cheap right now I’m trying to figure out if I can afford **not** to buy them
Absolutely wrong. Palantir has a functional product that is exceptionally valuable to their clients.
They won’t have any products or revenue until 2024 at the earliest. This is all pure hype, no reasoning behind it. People will pull out and it will plummet in 2021
Just bought in for more fun.
Buy otm calls on any kind of boomer stock
AMAZON YOU PILE OF SHIT GO UP
FSR going to the moon all of 2021
Fucking hell GME need the squeeze to come ANYTIME NOWWW....
Just joined PLTR gang, feels good man
How does this compare to LAZR post merger?

Donate to my charity plz
Keep going TSLA🚀🚀🚀
A whole week of red. Fuck christmas.
[removed]
lol for real, you don't lose when you bought the dip in meme stocks, while the CRM dip just keep dipping
I have a few calls for April, but I accidently bought $25 call for 1/8. Too early and should sell? Or keep it should be up by then?
I’ve played PDD a few times and I swear it’s the most manipulated gyna
You silly silly heretic
We've all thought we were buying the BABA dip at one point
Comment
I am scared too 😱
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oOYMH_lWNa4) is very importante
Find an otm call and buy $2000 worth?

Make sure it expires 12/31
Same people who would buy calls at the top on overvalued meme stocks 🤡
You got it pal!
Whew that makes me feel better about my account today
Ha. It is probably.  I've got a stop loss on it if that tells you anything.  You just need to buy everything you're bullish on when the market has a down day as a whole.  If SPY is dragging EVERYTHING down then buy contracts as far out as you can afford.  I've done it twice now and it's worked out great.
cursed image
Paid $270 for GME contracts that are now worth $15 lmao....
Robin hood needs to fix their platform, this is 150% gain. I wasn't even aware it glitch like this, it looks cool though.

Put 2k in GME April calls. You'll lose money 100%
I was +50% on 30c that I bought yesterday morning.

Doubt I'll even be able to see these before the early close lol
Why not?
BABA, play Free Falling.
If you read this have a nice christmas and sit straight you retard.

Never said they would
You can buy mine

Means it’s prob gonna dump bro.

How high and how far out should I sell the call if GME is trading at $20 let’s say.
Here comes the Christmas Eve surprise
Wonder if the price is being depressed on a low volume day tho
You're god damn right.

China want to compete is Westernised markets. They want Baba to have a high value,  to rise up the NASDAQ
FUCK YEAH BRUH!!!!

I feel like that was expected post acquisition, but I’m staying in.,, for no reason other than I like it
sell weekly or monthly cc at whatever price you feel good at letting it go
THCB, we can say it now. Also, 🚀🚀🚀🚀.
I got destroyed
Hold these 1/15 pltr $27c’s?
felt this in my soul RIP
got shares.long live BABA
I mean chances are they are still making a profit at this level
I fucking hate what this subs become shut the fuck up you peasant
its on a down trend and instead of waiting to buy calls at 230 you could make money inbetween that.

edit: holy crap just saw it was 218 now
BABA pain is real.
Go buy alone. I won't avg down further.
Send it to the Nigerian prince in your spam folder
IV on PLTR is so high that I just knocked 5% off my entry-price today by selling 7DTE covered calls against them @ $30.  Damn.
ok cool that will work my IG is @gardi_inc
Wait, so shareholders aren't even clear about what exactly the company does? Sounds like a management team to stay far away from!
Because I’m holding it
The $11 clowns are waiting for the WSBers to buy high and sell low so they can get back in.  Hold and make them regret selling to us!
🚀🚀🚀
Hehheh....
Never played options before but I could lose $2k quick to offset taxes on unemployment monies which I paid zero on (and used all to buy stocks seen here)... What's move? How to lose $2k but no more before new year?
AUPH taking off 🚀🚀
Nobody in here is actually gonna hold GME over the holiday weekend, right? Please don’t be that stupid
Are you forgetting that BABA was in the $300’s and climbing just a few short months ago? 

Jack Ma spoke out against the CCP. The CCP can’t be made to look like fools. You’re silly if you think the CCP won’t dismantle one of their most successful companies to prove a point. 😂
short squeeze- it's worth more to prop it up and keep it flat than it is to let it drop it seems
You thing SQ gonna go lower into EOD today or is this the dip? I can’t sell if I get in today 😵😵
Me too. Holding june or july calls
Yeah you likely got hit with the wash sale rule, look it up, they adjust your cost basis.
Unless the ones spun out become wholly state owned.  Jack Ma has already told Xie that the government can have any part of BABA it wants.
BABA leaps a good idea?
Just be patient. They are legit. Once everyone realizes it it will moon again to 80+ - double down if you can.
I took a small position as well thinking along the same lines.
Short NKLA.  That shit will be at 0 in < 1 year.

Definitely looking for an opening in a few weeks, S T I C is a good play but will probably see a pullback under current value I think.
Also look at the historical chart, this shit always booms to some insane level every console cycle
This sounds oddly like shit that “adults” do. Nah.
Betting on China being trustworthy...
3 employees in the entire company 🤡
SRAC the real space play 🚀🚀
hold, you could sell covered calls to lower your avg  price
So glad I bought TSLA calls at open
It’s a shit stock that will fall below 10

I hold PLTR in at 24 just letting it sit tbh but thanks for the advice
No news is why it's falling.  It's boring investors.
Hope they’re shares I’m sure it will come back up....eventually.
Well, the obvious risk is the CCP will be a lot tougher on this than we think. We have no idea how far CCP will go.

I’m heavy into BABA too though (although at this point just trying not to lose more than I already have...) so hope you’re right!
Probably minimal impact. According to that article India could limit iron ore exports, which means higher demand for scrap steel outside of India. So India market shrinks, but the rest of the world increases because of the reduced supply from India.

Thats it im never touching spy again fuck this shit
LMAO WHERES ALL THE 🌈 GME HOLDERS NOW
I'm starting to sadly think that NIO is just this.. up and downs in the mid 40s but that's pretty much it.. probably not a great stock after all even in the long term.
I'm in on 12/31 220P and 12/31 225P. uP $500 on both so far.

I plan to exit these contracts at end of trading day today (1:00 PM EST).

EDIT: Not too convicted on these positions as I'm only one contract on each, lol.
All I want for Christmas is for someone to buy my put spreads on abnb
Who was buy fucking puts?? It was at a 6 month low with insane fundamentals.
72% in a year is insane. In another sub they would be DROOLING. They would bash you because you took risks but DROOLINGA

We glorify 5-200x, huge gains here, but profit is profit

If you could do that for 10 years dude that would be 226x.

Enjoy it and may all your days be green
Holy fuck I'm rich

If it’s fucking stocks why would you dump it? Literally just hold it dumbass
Give it up, BABA.

You're not going to stay above $220.
That's my quirk!
I was excited last night to buy into the dip today 😕😕
I think you’re right on all points
Three day rule, just wait for IV to cool
Yes please Chamath said SLACK was a steal and they going big
Well it might go sideways too
Mods banned sir jack a lot but I think his dd was actually legit. This thing has potential. Just started trading a few days ago and when more people catch on this is gonna fly

Did you dump your entire portfolio into 0dtes?
Yep this will be a good one once people realize that

It's not a history of fraud. This is an ambulance chaser law firm that files investigations all the time in hopes of digging up something. It's likely BS, don't worry.
funny last week i posted blnk and plug, and my message got banned because blnk wasn't 1b market cap and now it is lol
Glad to see Baba take a shit after it absolutely fucked me and dumped a quarter of my account in one day in August for no fucking reason 

Think it was like august 6 or 7
That shit had zero chance of getting through the Grim Reaper anyway
Played PLTR perfectly this morn. Cashed out 0dte puts and turned em into call spreads.
now i know not to - truly never had this issue before I guess I just didn't know - I feel like that's an absurd jump though regardless
Always sell CCs
it went pretty sideways from sep 2018 - mar 2020 as well. i guess covid gave it a huge boost but now its found its footing around 3K again

Fuck I should’ve just bought more meme stocks
Wow did baba puts fucking print
I literally have a race in my portfolio every day to see if WYNN can't overtake AXP. Way more entertaining than whatever work thinks I am doing.

I have 8 contracts in play right now.  Going decently...
> sold Spaq at $9 and went $23 next day

It took Spaq almost a month to go from $9 to $23
Anyone who thinks this guy is shilling can simply Google "steel prices" and click on news.

$SQ dip?

I’m fucking obsessed with NET
I’ve got a lot tied up in 60c 2/19.
I dont know what a spac is and at this point I'm to afraid to ask, and or google
You will likely get a better price, once you place an order to close those calls.
Stopped reading at: "we made money"
cuz the market never cared about poor people getting checks
you bought after it went up 100% in a week?
🙏🏾🙏🏾
Cloudera ☁️ anyone?
With this spy dip FCEL has never looked so good.
I mean seriously do not miss out my fellow tards
I'm experiencing the Xmas theme today, keep bouncing back and forth from red to green on the day.
Yes but patience. Itll be a good short but too much retard strength rn
Fomo is the one thing we're capable of perceiving that transcends dimensions of time and space. Maybe we should trust that, even if we can't understand it.
It wasn’t at 34 yesterday
Papa Elon please goto 670 in the next 30-45 minutes. This will make up for me losing almost everything on battery day. 🙏🙏🙏🙏🚀🚀🚀
Intro Vert, it means in the green in latin
#HOW IS PTON AT 165 😂😂😂
oof
for today! was down -4% on my portfolio, now -11% all time woo!
Don't buy GME dip. It won't be the last. I don't want to see you guys get hurt
Positions? All in GME!
Buy high sell mars...retard
Yes. They announced: declining YoY revenue, worse than expected earnings, increased store closures. Filed for a 100M shelf offering which they will surely be using soon. Good e-commerce growth but 300% of a small number isn't that relevant.

As a multiple of revenue it's trading like a shitty B&M store with bad growth prospects lol
The $8 Price target damage. The other price targets are irrelevant apparently.
THCB the ticker isn't banned anymore
Positions or ban, but probably not because it appears the mods have given the fuck up.
I just rolled down the strikes on my BABA calls in some pathetic futile attempt to get just a little bit of delta in case this is the bottom.  I am like an abused spouse that just keeps giving my man one more chance.  It is just fucking sad.... please everyone avert your eyes.  😔😔😔
He said in a previous comment that he let go of most of his THC-B already
DONT.
BABA is fine. This is maximum pain. They will fine and ease the handling, for they are buying shares right now. Communists love money as much as you do.
How much you wanna bet this is just political theater and pony show for Baba?  Xi is flexing on BABA to show everyone never, ever fuck with the communist party, but at the same time, they don't want to scare the bejesus of out investment, especially into the tech sector, which is where China is desperately trying to overtake the US.  

It's a monopoly anal probe.  It'll probably result in nothing but 'reform' recommendations in the end.  Just a big political show.
Citron got me twice,  once on NIO once on PLTR, for about 60k overall
Almost like 90% of ARKK is not TSLA
E O S E profit taking today...
Thanks, I think I'll stay on daily Riot Plays.
💯 I think it’s oversold here. It sold off on antitrust concerns a month ago too.
I take it back I got scared
?? Canoo is an amazing EV company that's been talked about for a month or so
Anyone selling covered calls on PLTR? Got tons of shares and am thinking this could be a good idea with how flat it’s been. Any thoughts?
It was down like 8% before today’s move
Is it late now :(
Sold FUBO at 34 yesterday.  Looking to get back in.
FUBU up next
No positions. Mods ban this fucker

PLTR just getting its rocket warmed up and breaking out of wedge formation
Yeah mb

Shoutout to the guy who posted yesterday morning “when you see NET drop 5% you buy NET”.
LCY from Tillman entry point, 1B market cap 🤑🤑
Drops on robinhood look way more dramatic than it really is. Except for BABA that shit going to 50
Exactly lol, all the indicators of the real economy are booming.
why would you hold 0dte on GME please tell me you're memeing
Dude genomics is the future lmao, just really think about it. ARKG is going to 300 in 2 years 100%
Hold or sell RYCEY
What’s the juice on BLNK? 🤔🤔🤔
RAVEN!!! What’s your problem........
I gotta say, these daily threads suck as sentiment indicators
I have held my leaps even though it’s weighing down my portfolio. Glad to see MT gang is still alive and out there. Here take this ICE award and may everyone receive mega tendies in the long run. 🚀🚀🚀🙏💎🙌
Rocket moon
lol, you are back
NNOMF in agreement with Tesla 🚀🚀🚀
Bounce It
I got out of PLTR because I was losing my ass so I invested yesterday in some BABA LEAPS assuming it was less risky. I feel like I won the opposite of the lottery.
Idk what is happening here, but someone plz explain
Baba bottom in
tiny spy crash incoming in 60mins IMO, so buy calls
Mods finally unbanned you?!? All hail the jerk off king!
LOL
I bought BABA 220C weekly. pray for me!

It’s hit 30 before but that was days/weeks ago. Could be wash sale? This your first time buying PLTR or did you buy and sell before yesterday at all?
[removed]
Dude how much fucking Adderall did you take
FUBO sounds like brazilian street soccer, what the fuck were you thinking buying it after +110% in a month.
[deleted]
In there with you, but 100 shares @10.54
Wish I bought calls instead
BABA settling at 220. Get your calls in
Lol so brave. What did u buy? Shares?
No, they integrate data from disparate sources and derive insights that would be otherwise difficult to achieve. They tell Airbus when to perform preventative maintenance on which parts and which airplanes so as to prevent larger, more costly repairs after parts fail. They are working with the US intelligence community to analyze and flag mountains of video and other data that would otherwise go unlooked at if left up to human beings. And those are just the things I've seen in person. They are legit
8% wtf you smoking, 695 all time high... it’s down like 4-5% lol
How much u selling that cyber cookie for
i just need sq to end green pls santa
I give up on the market this week
Anyone know when S B E will turn into ChargePoint? 

Charge Point is the largest EV charging company around the globe.
Any reason HYLN still falling? Not seeing any news
ARKK green when TSLA red and vice versa.
FB. They are gonna crush earnings
https://markets.ft.com/data/commodities/tearsheet/summary?c=Iron+ore doesnt seem to be going down right?
Sell it. I am sure Cramer asking to take profit is coming up.
Stop selling XL my god it has dipped enough
I have been looking at them too. Wondering the same
How far out are y’all getting your BABA calls for? July?
PLTR 12/31 $30 is free money
So it will either go up or it will go down? Got it.
Always hold ETFs
Sell it for a little profit. That will drop like a rock into closing.
I didn’t know it was this kind of party
Short weeks should give you your day trades used last Friday.
I’m holding until next year. I’ve lost a lot already. 💎🙌🏼 baby! It’s a Christmas thing issue. Once the defense act passes I think it’ll soar to the moon!
Zuck put his Scrooge mask on
My mom doesn't want me playing with you guys anymore, she says youre dumb and make me lose my allowance
XL is gonna moon again BUY THE DIP
Intuitively, why do you have above SMA as an indicator?

I don't trade directly on RSI but I assume the same principle of meme reversion that RSI is built on.
Seems like the real opportunity for this company is in tournaments/exhibitions/gaming contests. Do they already do that? I have been a shareholder for one hour and believe I can right this ship.
I can’t resist. ALL-in on 12/31 BABA 240s
damn so the MVIS rally is over??
The amount of VLDR GOEV fucking cocksucker pumpers that comment 5000 times a day and disappear lost people an insane amount of money the last few days.
Surprising no one is talking about the $2000 stimulus vote failing in the house..

who bought FUBO at the top lmaooo rip
That’s exactly why that beesh off limits
Thank you tesla sold my 655 calls for a nice gain. Have a nice holiday everyone. Especially everyone who is alone, I feel for you and hope you have a nice time.
The $8 price target, and the $50 and $60 price targets ignored.
Yea.. I should cool down. I will just sit out today . If it reaches 200 I will go in tho.
Whoever said to get TSLA 665c yesterday was genius. Unfortunately I passed.
PRPLLLLL
What was your worst trade for the year? Mine was just recently...lost 14k on fedex calls
they have a very small foothold, which is getting smaller all the time lol
And then more

I just bought a Jan 29 call for $30 and 100 shares of GME. Am I doing this right? When do I make thousands of dollars??
That’s what you idiots get for funding the commies. I prefer to lose my money on AMZN, BUD, and MCD like a real American
No I believe in MA we go to moon got some lottos

I have reverse Midas touch. I even lost money on Lemonade
Buy the GOEV dip, $30 Q1 2021 💪
i would be happy with 29
Soooo...all in on bark box then?
Eh it’s not impossible. God speed soldier
STIC is still super early. Bark looks like a legitimately great business. revenue growing YoY, high retention rate (super important for a subscription business). All this with the pet market growing a ton from COVID. This is one I would buy SPAC or not.
He fear no one
Apple is an auto stock now.  So technically Apple.
Half a life? Tf lmao
You gotta start thinking past this minute, dude.
Anyone else set the limit price of worthless OTM options for something outrageous?

BABA!!!! STOP, STOOOP! ITS ALREADY DEAD!

Finally been day trading TSLA with positive results thanks to the trailing stop loss. Wish I could go back March and do the same for all my trades.

If AAPL hits $134 an hour before market close it will truly be a Christmas miracle for me 🍏🚀
But, chinese stock.
Where the fuck are all you AMD retards at ? We all know this shit is drilling below 90. Why is it even trying to pump
GME contract down 93%.....really hope this squeeze happens or there goes my entire port
Did quad witching happen after the dip? My chart shows 3/23 as the lowest day for SPY. Quad witch should've been the third Friday in March, so before the 21st.
As someone who's a surgical tech. Good luck and God speed.
Fuck yea
Gz fku
will nio go back up for nio day?
yeah no that "history" might make an idiot satisfied but i can see it only goes to Oct 30, meaningless
[deleted]
Is there any reason to hold my 1/15 GOEV calls right now...
Cathie on holiday already???? Get back to work pleas
[deleted]
Sure looks like it’s getting pinned at $29.
When the volume on your covered call is so bad that the spread makes no sense so you’re down 1k and the underlying stock is down 2k. Logic.
Every other day this week
At this point... if you bought enough Apple shares, your calls would print lol. You Need someone to start a meme for aapl on here haha
This is a long play. It’ll grow huge next year
this is not the way
Yeah Apple might keep pushing today anyway the rest of the day so you’ll probably be good. I’m deciding now if I wanna take the profit in my Apple call and roll it into ICLN calls
RIP
BABA starting to flatten out. Preparing to start moving back up or continue to fall further. Stay tuned.
Bof
Got one at 17.10 just to remind me its there, going to average down if it dips to the 15 range. I see more short term downside, like BFT
You YOLOing retards were truly the greatest gift of them all
Buy high sell low. I love that game. I master it every time
Who’s holding RYCEY? Our payday should be imminent. London Stock Exchange is closed right now. The rolls Royce stock trading on LSE affects the RYCEY stock right?
I know AMZN is a complicated business but can anyone explain its sideways movement the past few months ?
Apple and Tesla carrying SPY on its back rn 🥴
Please GME go up

It just ends up being invested in U.S. tech stocks or booze. The booze in Ontario is sold through government stores.
Let’s go to the fucking mooon🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Yeah. Did you? Current management is already doing a decent job of cutting costs and refocusing on what makes money. RC will expand on that and the console cycle will be a catalyst for enormous earnings growth. As a multiple of revenue it’s trading like a short term bankruptcy risk, which it definitely is not.
It’s the closest thing they can find to the world is ending
NGA. Canadian stock. Going to the moon

Solid DD from the pp
no, MM will not let 29k open interest on 30c get ITM
Its a joke and a half
GE gang checking in
So bigger picture here. They want to connect all the data and information. sources together at the businesses and I think big picture is to have all their clients information connected (for what is worth) so they could effectively be the all seeing eye. 

Fuck...LEAPs or Stonks?
How high you think this is gonna go? Tempted to sell mow
Thank you AMD, I guess I’m having porter house steak for dinner tonight

It's china!!!!! Not the US, there won't be a break up it will become part of the CCP and jack ma will end up in a camp.
You and half of this sub.
Anyone else getting bent over by baba?
Yeah that’s why I said it hit my entry price. I got filled at $6 and it bounced back to $6.20 immediately. Just barely caught it.
You got in too late
I'm staying in for the long run
Could also be worthless
Did jack ma not bow before the supreme leader Winnie the Pooh as suggested by WSB?
No. We can only crawl until the MM's has shaken out enough gamblers.
what’s your suggestion lol
If what happened
These are the best.
Fuck $SQ really. Wtf is this bleeding? I exited my position
I see y'all bought that THCB dip
Stock market become sentient AI

[removed]
FUBO wow
So frustrating
I would rather let these fucking options expire than let the MM's win and sell

EDIT:  Oh fuck that is exactly how they win....
A dip after inclusion was expected. A flight after the dip was not a given.
does open interest and volume mean nothing to you
Sell if you have paper hands; it’s a long term hold now.
Strike and exp?
I can’t remember the last time I saw the colour red in my portfolio.

Ya know. Buy a game for 60. Trade it in for 15 cents later. Getting ass raped without having to go gay
Don't say I didn't tell you about SENS
I gotta get out of GOEV.  This is fucking ridiculous
AAPL has hit 134 and retreated thrice
When do they learn?
Why does Berkshire get no love when Apple skyrockets? BRKB is effectively a managed Apple etf
Imagine making just 15% a day... and its more than you make in 10years

Edit: time
Aapl deal w NIO more likely to happen now than with TSLA
Feels good to be making money before the new year but I'm still shocked we aren't red af off of the news in Washington. Not complaining tho
Bought, join us on this burning ship so if it fails I don't feel as alone in my poor choices.
At least you gave it a good ol fashioned college try.
My TSLA call I sold yesterday only up 300% today :(
Yeah, I was there and watched my hands turn to diamonds when it dropped. It's a massively shorted stock that is undervalued because boomers just take it as face value "blockbuster lol" and ignore that gaming as a market is booming and GME has a huge foothold and by increasing their offerings, service, ecommerce platform and brand they could turn things around massively. We just need young money RC at the helm to drive this spaceship.
Just a big dolla fiddy dildo
RH will sell your calls automatically. So lock in your gains or let it roll
My tsla calls are slowly coming back from the grave. Just need another big day to bring iv back to what they were 😂
where were you at 9:40 damn
I could have made 10 grand today but I pussied out, never again.

Lol bro come on
The rug pull on XL this morning was evil. Up 7% before open and goes down 10% at open? Smfh
that's a lie lol
I think 125B is fair. I find it hard to put a value on SQ though, it’s potential it’s clear but how much that potential is worth is hard to determine.
Elon-you will make a believer of me yet

TSLA-MARS🚀

So about that TSLA selloff....
I sold
That’s the daily question for the past month, followed by eod dump :(
Why the fk is Bloomberg covering this Europoor Brexit thing?

I wonder what happened to that one guy who shorted TSLA at 600 with all of his money.

Are TSLA and ARKK inversely related or some shit lmao
Mods just need to start instabanning these. People are figuring out with modest gains you can make it look like you started with almost nothing and turned it into a multi thousand % gainer just by withdrawing the right amount.

anyone that has made some gains in RH and then withdrawn has seen this.
I want one

Fuck today. Happy holidays y’all
NICE. When are you taking STIC profits and coming back to GME?

I'm kinda thinking about another possibility. As shorties keep shorting and weaseling out of big losses, maybe even into slight profits... and we longs keep inching higher and higher as weeks go by, is there a chance for TSLA like growth in 2021?

Is Ryan Cohen the second name to add to the list of People You Never Bet Against, right below Elon?

If yes, what % of likelihood would you give to something like that?

EDIT: Because if you think about it, before this megamooning of 2020, TSLA was pretty much stagnating for years. Now, OK, GME has been depreciating for years now, so it's not exactly the same, but there is a possibility for turnaround story with a visionary in the mix, similar to how Elon's unwavering conviction endured through TSLA's infancy stage?

And shorting TSLA has pretty much been big rage back in the day, not even that long ago. Similarities much?!
Being investigated for breaking monopoly laws in China. It’ll pass as even Xi knows Alibaba is one of China’s best companies

wait a sec if u peak on thanksgiving was it PLTR :O
Buy fear on $BABA?  Let's assume Xi brings the epic commie shit storm of hellfire down on BABA due to Jack Ma.  Aren't companies often worth more piecewise than as a whole?  Investors in BABA will get shares of all of the spinouts, which is typically what happens when a monopoly is broken up, although I'm not entirely quite sure what happens with a Chinese company. 

People who had AT&T got shares in all of the Baby Bells after AT&T got broken up.  It ended up being very profitable.

However selling now is literally selling when there is max fear. Not a good idea
Agreed. Avg down heavy here
Gonna be a huge rip leading into its Jan showcase
Gonna need like...a LOT of things to turn around today.
Saw that ark was buying surface oncology a few days ago so started to look at it.. They have a new deal with GSK that has potential for them to receive $700 million, and yet their entire market cap is less than $400 million. Am I missing something or would that imply that they are very undervalued at current price?
SRAC has been to orbit already

Hold your shares how are you going to paper hand this one

That's what you get for joining hands with those fucking commies.

Go back to bed
Shares or calls?
I could have sold yesterday at 700% but I wanted that 10 bagger.

Reminder fellow small fish. RH will close out your options if you don’t have enough money to buy the number of stock one hour before close. Might see a dip around that time. 

TSLA 670 by 1155 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
everyone knows about that meme story of some boomer uncle who forgot about his apple/msft shares for awhile and then one day found out he was rich as balls.

this will be this generation's equivalent stock. this fuckin shit will print enough tendies to start college funds for future kids in human colonies on the fucking moon.
Is PLTR hittin 30 today?
I just got fucked man I’m so sad
JOE just keeps going up
Long term it should recover. I wanna buy options tho

The market is literally bear traps til the end of the pandemic.

No options. 700 stocks bought around 28.95

I think what happens on wsb should stay there
Yeah! It’s still really early I’m buying again @ 17
Why arent my all-in NKLA calls printing?
Um mvis? Lolol

CHRISTMAS MIRACLE. TESLA, APPLE MOONING AND GME EATING SHIT !
It's just hype
I bought a few shares off this post... THEN did some research.  What’s up with their [history of fraud?](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/shareholder-alert-rigrodsky-long-p-231300525.html)

Looks like it was a pump and dump by the OP.  Glad I only took a small position and didn’t go big on STIC.  Just gonna hold and see what happens.
SQ enough pls. I can only get fucked so hard it hurts too much
This guy
Fuck it just broke support
Should I give up on my 1/15/21 $26c?
Share or call/put? Expiry?
[removed]
When do they expire
F
Free free fallin’
I bought 2 shares at $220...and 2 more set for $215 

Retarded? maybe but LFG!!!!!!!!
Don't worry guys Xi is totally cool, and rational he won't over reach and nationalize BABA.
We’ll I’m playing 6/18 debit spreads
MY MAN I WAS WAITING TO SEE YOU POP UP IN HERE💦💦💦
Just woke up god dam baba
Just barely hit my entry level on MVIS.
You gonna make BANK
Calls but fuck it looks like it’s being pinned down around 227
It’s 28 now, what do you think about next Monday?
[deleted]
Y’all really forgot it’s down like 8% over the last 2-3 days
Volume has been steadily declining
Please slap me again lord elong
Yeah, definitely. People are expecting a big boost Monday (it probably won’t be big but I imagine around $22 point).
how much would i. make off a 675 call expiration that’s today in TSLA, it only costed me 50$
[deleted]
It's a distraction, go buy some other goodies...
i sold at 1400 shares at 18, back in at 17. Hopefully a nice rise to eod.
Hope so, and I'm out of day trades.
[deleted]
DA hasn’t come through yet so probably yea. Depends how long you are holding for
they said gaming on CNBC..
Buy dip
Brooooooo this hits different. PLTR 29c 12/24

I will just leave this here, i sense a need: The National Problem Gambling Helpline  1-800-522-4700
My mvis calls are freeeeefallllinnnnngg
Hold or sell PLTR for loss?
would have been tough to get a fill anyway
Wtf GOEV
Imagine asking that like any retard on here knows the future
Buying $440 calls on Baba expiring in 2022
got a better idea.
Goev is pathetic. Shouldve sold it yesterday.
Kinda boring
Jesus MVIS
TradingView is hard to set up
Is it still a good buy? Missed jack alots post rip
He's streaming. Recording himself. Pretty cool channel. "They work, I hustle they work"
Doo it! I did.
NOOOO HIT 30 TODAY
Good job brother
Aapl slightly elevated but not quite moon!
BABA and BIDU going to be pegged at the same price next week
AAPL KEEP GOING, I CANT AFFORD THIS LOSS

[https://ibb.co/n1CxKhd](https://ibb.co/n1CxKhd)
BABA has rage quit
Wooo go TSLA 🚀🚀🚀
Just dropped 100K on BABA. Overreaction to its finest. Let’s fucking go
What did you make of it when it was 50% HIGHER just a couple months ago...
I can tell you it wasn’t going to be at open 😂
GME gang?🚀🚀🚀
i have one on the way and will post if it's shit or not
he already did, that's why it shows he's up some comical %
Happy Cake Day!
are y'all really bullish on GME, like in reality?

Did you even listen to the earnings call...????
I bought a shitty condo for 390k worth 490-515k now in around 27 months. Nice zip code in Bay area.

 He’s a difficult guy, doesn’t like concerts or shows, doesn’t drink, doesn’t have any real hobbies I could get something for (besides golf which he buys himself everything). I already got him satellite radio for his TSLA so I just need something else to actually give him on Christmas cause he likes having something to open. I’m thinking something else for his TSLA like a trunk organizer or something idk. I’ll figure it out lol.

Is PLTR breaking out soon or what?
Just got in Baba right now at 10:36. It won’t go any lower I feeeeel. Bless lord Buddha, holy Allah, Son of Jesus Christ, almighty Krishna.
Did you collect two of every retard?
Fuck Chinese gov fuck communism fuck baba
Listening to [China's National Anthem](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UctriMuXYS0) as the CPC seizes my portfolio.
Holy shit. That's brilliant. Imagine how many tendies you can get by immediately putting that $20k into FD's
Baghold VALE $19c 3/19?
Why does baby grinch look exactly like Mitch McConnell
Same! I only did shares but I bought my first call with MT expiring 1/22. After this post though I guess I’m about to double down for a June call, thanks daddy steel!!
I'm done with Chinese stocks. The Chinese government can literally do what they want and what they please, BABA can go to $0 if it wanted to. Sold my calls out of fury, have a nice day.
RIP in peace bro
How do you people find these random ass stocks
You gotta gamble those 0.2k away real quick if you want reddit points.
I want to go in BABA now. Pleas stop me
TSLA flying again 😍
So now we’re silent on GME, GME gang 1/15 Calls we holding strong through the new year?  Still think we might have a rally today? Anyone getting out today then hopping back in Monday?
coiling
TY
Blood
Theta + my calls = $0
and buy back after the dip ! you're welcome and merry christmas
I’ll make this easy 

**FCEL** is free money as it runs up to its biggest battery showcase its ever had jan 16 and It’s in their with the big boys like BLNK and sbe. This will hit $20 by then and I don’t think you’ll see another dip like this.. just want us all to have some Christmas tendies
I felt this
Cant wait for GOEV to never be investigated for this pump and dump!
Is nvax a dicey company?
Guys buy BABA
[deleted]
It’s a Christmas miracle! The NET calls I bought yesterday at the dip are printing. Merry Christmas retards!
I know some of you PLTR bulls didn't meet your quota of 69 rocket emojis yesterday and that's why we're not mooning.

Shame on you.
No ones looking, it's going up...
shares? yes
well have you? once you do the top is in
God the red on my portfolio hurts.

Fucking FB ain't even helping fuck
As much as I like green, it’s the red that has the potential for tendies
WAS TOLD THERE BE $GME SQUEEZE AND TENDIES??
Is it?
Serious question

I bought some palantir shares at close yesterday and the price paid was 30.83 - what the fuck?? It's never even hit 30?? market order
Yes
Baba -14%

Party City -4%

I'll let you do the math

Am I the old tard still going hard on DKNG? Everyone else just talking about GME and BABA
bro just buy more on the dip,
And it's basically free money at 1% rates. They had the cash on hand but didn't want to burn it. They have about $800 million of cash left on hand, $180 million can be used for stock buybacks. Once they get their cloud offering solidified, they need to start investing for growth and going after new logos again. If they can tick the growth rate higher and keep the profitability where it is, then the stock will be in great shape. 

That, or someone like IBM buys them, combines them with RH to create an open source infrastructure king, and starts pushing it into all of their accounts.

Rag pluh
Totally not the sign of a bubble.
Ofc the only tech stonk I have calls expiring today is taking a dump
That’s what adderal pretty much is.
Do it faster.
Well Santa rally was a crock of shit
Screw it. I'm going for as much leverage as possible. It's the only way to keep up with inflation. Cashing out my 401k to buy TQQQ OTM calls on a portfolio margin account using box spreads to fund my account and not witholding any taxes to maximize account balance.
[deleted]
you think 1/22 200$ puts are free money??? just wait until you try 1/15 140$ puts!!!
[deleted]
Yup, sold my calls yesterday because I didn't believe. FML.

12/31 calls? Maybe some 750s?
Should I buy more ARKG even though it’s up 20% this month
Lol you guys must be new to WSB. The discussion has been hashed 800000 times in the last 3 months. Longs are squeezing a short position that is over 100% of float. Activist billionaire investor whiz kid aka the "god" is posturing to takeover the company and turn blockbuster into Netflix in the next 5-10 yrs. New console cycle and holiday season expected to show good earnings in new year. Get hyped. Buy some shares for your kids for Christmas. Be prepared to lose it all or ride to Valhalla, no bitching along the way allowed. Your welcome. Merry christmas.

Edit: your wife is welcome. You're also welcome.
FCEL getting nice and stable for one last rip up b4 christmas 🚀🚀🚀🚀

What BABA price correlates to 1tril market cap? Like 310$ right?
So I can kidnap some fucker and make $270k?  

Why is nobody doing this???
Have you considered...looking at the last 3 or 4 daily candles? That's what a short squeeze looks like
Yea I wanted to get in but missed it already. :(
Quick info with no sources: they have lots of cash and are making moves to accept digitalization. The valuation of that should have put the fair price higher than it was, but there was a shit ton of short interest. Theory is that a short squeeze could happen
What happened with that BB insider trading 7.5 call guy?
next year
Why should I buy shares when warrants are available?
BJ of UK claims to have a great deal with EU so it is definitely not great, any details out from any third party who has seen the deal yet?
You still on apex?
The Squeeze will happen during after hours trading, and RH will 'crash'. We will not be allowed to participate

I’m reading up, seems risky as fuck. At least with a conventional buy/sell There is very little risk of complete loss of investment.
Not going to be delisted, I bought call spreads in March.
Dang man, this is the best comment I’ve ever seen.
I don’t like this game anymore I’m gonna go play doom instead

Low standards. I wouldn't turn her away but super hot she is not. The company, though, that IS super fucking hot. I've seen some of the work they do related to my particular industry and it really was impressive. Consequently, I have a fair amount of my portfolio in PLTR. And I intend to hold... practically marrying this super hot company.
You’d have to be missing a chromosome to use this thing

And there's the other half of what APHA gained yesterday.
Alright Ameri-jokes, Europoors have finally gotten done a Brexit deal.  Sign a damn stimulus bill into action already.

Anyone know anything about HRTX?

Hopefully you didn’t buy weeklies. There’s so much dd out there and the consensus is that it could happen any time in the next 3 months and most likely will be bursts at a time leading to the big squeeze.

No , we just clearing $100 support
Ramen Noodle crafts bud.  Times are now tough.
Who knew that in these troubling times, elon daddy’s lap would be a safe haven
I'm slowly regretting not selling at 22 yesterday. I lost 15 shares by daily swing-trading GME in the first half of December (made profit, but then it started mooning and I spent all those profits to buy less shares lol), but we really seem to have topped out at 22 for now.

I'd be down to grab more shares, claw my way back to 250, but I'm also hesitant to sell now considering we're literally bottoming out 20.5 for the second day in a row. With my incomplete understanding of technicals, that is slowly starting to look like a new support - weak one, but holding for now...
STIC 😉😉
no, just landing for its next payload to Mars. All in on shares for me.
what's your favorite mathematical constant

Get the fuck in TSLA now
I’m in an abusive relationship with BABA
How the hell did you manage to do that on GME this week? Lol
They are also cash flow positive (Non-GAAP), which means they can actually pay for this. They got the $500 million for 1% and bought $315 million shares off Intel (buying them out) for $12.02. That's a very good deal considering the current stock price. Also, it means if a buyer comes in, Intel doesn't have to be appeased to approve the transaction.

There is a market perception problem with Cloudera. Are they a legacy Hadoop company or are they a data platform company using best of breed open source tech that they integrate? I believe it is the latter but they have done a terrible job of technical marketing.

"The Enterprise Data Cloud Company" Ok, wtf is that? If it's Hadoop, you guys are dead, if it's something else, we need to know about it.
Wow, IWM actually dropping as SPY goes up. What kind of upside down day is this?

When Tesla rallies after red days it RALLIES. Plus we get the bonus of it being a holiday and news is relatively decent so chances are yes if it’s dated for longer than today.
On the bright side, sounds like it can’t get any worse. Time to get off this sub, get out of your shitty relationship, and start saving your money again. Bluntly put, you clearly aren’t good at trading options or managing risk, so disable that on your broker. Life is full of ups and downs. This is a down for you, but you gotta get yourself together to turn it around. Merry Christmas

I sold my BABA at +1% as soon as Xi nuked Ant Group IPO. When Chinese government want some company or person to die, it will happen.

At 660, do you have the midas touch?? Any other stocks that you think are going to fail today?
Thoughts on BABA??
Up 63% in rrsp. Needed money because I was laid off so I sold tsla from my tfsa made out pretty good. Wish I held on to it though. Bought it around 360 before the split sold 430 after.

PLTR is coiling up below resistance. It’ll pop any day now.
We already do, care to join us?
Shouldve dumped money into stic AH yesterday, is it still a good buy yall?
That’s because the fat is in the federal budget, not the Covid bill. If they start renegotiating the budget a government shutdown will occur. 

Keep in mind that most of the “fat” Trump complained about was in the White House’s budget proposal.
i’ve got a 675 and 700 call in it expiration today
uppies pls
Thank Santa I got PRPL to cushion the BABA pain today
Christmas is red and green, therefore we will have some stocks red and some green.

That's what everyone thought the last few times it tanked. "285 buy up that dip", "270 no way that's a steal", "it hit 250 it can't go lower than this", and then this morning "I need to hurry up and get this for $235 premarket before it gaps back up"
This might be baba's biggest drop ever...bought shares and calls
It's just cause Square is down.
what’s the next day trade move
cause acquiring tidal is a stupid idea.
Why do you stay in the relationship, if it is chronically abusive?

Maybe stupid but averaging down on XL

Ok, fair enough. Would you mind posting proof of your positions for the dimwit retards here?
This is just a covered call right
Held after +30, held after -9, holding after +80...... diamond hands brother there is still more upside
RIOT and SQ just cancelled my Christmas.  All gifts going back.
The most sideways stock I’ve had since I bought at $29
Literally my favorite stock. Every time it drops like it did yesterday you just buy calls. It’s free money.
bought the baba dip. Politics aside, baba is doing a sound and healthy business.
buy up the fubo dip

any NYSE tickers you can provide?
yes
Who knows....only thing I care is that its going up. And if they did, then everyone will catch on soon
I stand corrected - I guess I was thinking of the market in general, not BABA specifically
They made that guy who made the post $300k overnight
You must be new here...
Safest bet is when it breaks the trendline from yesterday to the opening this morning. You'd end up buying much higher but you'll also avoid getting in too early.
You mean roughly when GameStop releases holiday sales and shows they’ve sold literally every single console they own? Okay I bet it’s gonna plummet
[deleted]
FSR and PLUG trying to make something happen here
Are you retarded? This is wallstreetbets.
I’m looking for the next one too, PLTR or LAZR could be solid leaps this year, premium kinda high now. GE $10 calls picked up in March for 1/15/21 did very well. They were pretty much dead until early November 😂
-6% on NET is the best gift ever, its my fifth time i‘ve averaged up
Nahhh GME pops $1 in like 5 mins
Some tickers i havent heard of, the only one i recognized was NIO
CANT CUCK MUSK
Jesus cringe... gay and also went on for an uncomfortably long amount of time. Not that I read it, the scrolling was enough.
Fuck PLTR

Fucking 16% drop on XL from open - gg to any put buyers
I just keep coming back to watch this. Thanks for such entertainment, OP.
Down 80% :)
2026 srac warrants are the real play. Strike on them is 11.50
I refresh the page and it goes up or down
Actually Baba backs XPEV... Which was briefly green but still down less than NIO
Enjoy this years gains, we are all going to spend the next 10 years paying it back

TLDR: Puts on USA

Let’s go JD and SE
I see it as a positive.  

It might take some time to push through 21 but at least it isn't dumping. Might establish a new floor here.
Is this the floor.. Baba..

Anyone gonna go in on BABA? Im at some family event someone tldr the investigation going on into them please, is it serious and could they be delisted or broken up?

At least your portfolio is festive with all the red
Holy shit that hit hard....and close to home
They unblocked this?
Are we tired of winning yet?

it was touching 659 when i commented this. just wait though, it will probably come back down further before close.

edit: well god damn
Same here, but at least they weren't 300 calls like mine. Just got out at -50%. Fucking China!
Yes. They were 0$ a day ago
2021 will be different! (Maybe)
I totally agree, we buy her like super cheap soft toys because the $20 ones only last a few hours longer anyway. My cur will accelerate that timeline lol... 30 seconds to get an opening, 10 minutes to remove the squeaker and after an hour all the stuffing is out and she is tossing around the empty skin like a ragdoll.

Seriously SQ?  I saw support at $27-$28

What the actual fuck is SQ doing 🤡
Im back in at 17 right now. What re-entry point are you thinking?
What a fake gay low volume day this is.  Was going to take profits on my 1/15s but I guess I’ll be fucking with that next week.  Merry Xmas ya’ll, hope your GME tendies were able to put a black market PS5 under your tree.

Some time in the first half of 21. If I had a real date for Investor DAY I would share but they just mentioned it during the UBS event in early December. You can view that presentation on the investor website if your trying to learn more.
Damn, should have held onto my BABA puts, just got a little spooked at the possibility of a quick reversal and secured profits. Oh well
So uh nobody really paying attention to the brexit deal they cut?

Have you looked at the volume on BABA? Already three times the average daily volume.
I sold half of my TSLA for 100% profit. Riding the rest until RH closes them out since there’s no way o have enough to buy that many TSLA stocks.

Same position. So far I’ve been fucked. Might jump off that canoo and into the lake
I got out break even by the skin of my teeth whew.
At what point do we get leaps on BABA, cause nothing ever comes from these probes on the big companies.
Baba will close around 200. Still some dumps to do before closing due to uncertainty IMO. 

200-205 will be a good buy. Don't buy yet!
That’s going to come next week -January
Dang, okay 79% are in, 21% aren’t.

not sure if i should buy baba or fubo
Actually I bought in on Dec 10 but did not get around to analysis till a day off today
Once again. Most of Amazon products is from Alibaba. Chinese government won't fuck it too much imo
67+ million of 70 million shares are held short. With share availability where it is, it would take 6 days to cover. Buy and hold.

Zero day trades left for this guy so I’m forced to hold.

That’s in India. They said earlier this week they were not going to allow any more exports because they need the material domestically. Our government will not do that. However, if the Trump steel tariffs are removed - it gives a huge boost to $MT and other global steel players. Honestly, with the price of steel and shortage of supply, the tariffs may need to be cut back a bit. Not an entire repeal. Imports are still higher than domestic prices by 15% because of the tariffs.
I might be missing something here but why tf GameStop?
Na you posted it in the right spot.  getting hated on is usually a good thing... only time will tell
What are they buying
Next time PLTR breaks $30 it’s not coming back down to earth
Are you using internet explorer by any chance?
did BABA puts actually gained that much
No just hold it for a few years
God damn I love reading your posts, man!! Your initial post https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/kakxrm/gme_tribe_a_story_about_how_ryan_cohen_is_about/ is what caused me to do a little more research and buy 2023 calls at a $15 strike shortly after the Q3 er massacre. This is the shit WSB needs more of. I appreciate this dd and your insight, and I hope you get filthy fucking rich. I have a modest stake, but if we get the MOASS I’ll still come out pretty handsomely on the other side. Best of luck to all of us, may our lord and savior Daddy Cohen take us to the promise land!!!
I don't think it will find support until $200, so I'd maybe buy under $205
No short interest or volume whatsoever . I really believe TSLA closes all time high
Baba?
And another fack pump, we go lower....

Bought the BABA dip with some debit spreads. Low volume day is probably making the sell-off worse.

No, profit and loss are measured in %, not $. You sir broke a bank, well done and good luck next year.

Keep cash on hand for a potential drop.

Or people finally realizing they spend more on electricity than they gain in coins?
thanks a lot mate, do you have some resource for me to dig deeper into this, like good write up or an article?
who’s going cash over the weekend
Classic pump and dump, ready for profit taking?
NO FUCKING 🧢
Yes Nick, don’t put all of your $86 into BABA.
Wait a bit. Catch it on the upswing. You’ve got time
Ditched BABA and now I’m bored and need new positions
The picture is a good idea. The guide trip is a little out of my price range rn and we just went in October.
Can confirm bought near top in August.
Sorry to whoever was in baba. Holy fuck.
Lmao
SQ what the fuck
I think the mixed news of stimulus deal status, China clamping down strong arm style, and Brexit news is a perfect combination for a flat market.
Get in on the weed maps merger SSPK
Can anyone tell me what’s happening with sq?
Sure, but I could also be down 750% with options
Why are SNAP and PINS drilling?
Holy shit GME 12/24 20c have a good chance of ending up ITM. What a world

BABA still too high IMO
imagine thinking BABA will be broken up.
That’s what I’m saying bro
Is anyone still in RKT? What do y’all think?
I sold April calls 10 mins aho to buy pot 🤷‍♂️
This is the way
It's just 2 grand and you can open a debit spread if you don't have 2 grand , TSLA options was 5-6 figures pre split
I know someone needs to hear this. Please do not buy OTM calls on baba for next week... 
Happy holidays
Eat my ass
The question is - do we buy tech calls today or wait till Monday or wait till next year!? 🤔🤔🤔
This is the way
I’d roundhouse my grandmother to have been able to know to get 0dte 227.5p on baba yesterday
Don't ever chase stocks my friend. Learnt this lesson the same way as you. Just make sure you don't repeat the mistake. Oh and happy birthday!

I use Palantir in my job(Softwere Dev) in the transportation industry. When you think of an industry where technology is not their product(Gov, Airlines, Healthcare) a product like Palantir absolutely makes sense it brings together all of the companies data to allow data analysts and data scientists to conduct analysis that “revolutionize” the business.  This is Palantir’s niche. If you think of a company where technology is on the forefront(Big Tech, Financial firms, etc) they already have aggregated their data in “one” platform by going to the cloud. Amazon or Google can simply make a data analysis feature on their cloud platform that would replicate the same functionality and thus making Palantir irrelevant. IMO this is interesting part of it all. Whether you believe legacy companies or companies that don’t normally invest in tech will rely on Palantir or make an effort to go to the cloud.
People are paper handing BABA. Think it will be a slap on the wrist. I think I will buy some calls
Had 2 TSLA 645c 12/31. Sold one 650c 12/31 to lock in half and did some research on call debit spreads... makes sense now!
Now let's see if the GOP can override orange fat asses veto on covid relief. Trump is a good entertainer
Yep 👌🏼
do i take XL out it’s at 29 bro
So sorry man
EEM only down .46% with this BABA movement
So April or June? Pick for me the safe one
Well fuck...there goes $2K for this yolo...
Was reading here last night that DKNG was looking at stockbuy back and partnership with Colin Cowherd. Has anyone heard of these rumors?
Happy holidays!

I mean that tidal deal doesn't make much sense for a fintech company
so wont JD be the winner here? why they selling off?
BABA sold off -8% in HK, now -14.4% and counting in US. Sure Commies are scary and shit but the discrepancy stands out. Does HK know something that we don’t?
LK was a million miles from what Baba is

China has puts on baba
11/30/2020 🤤 🤝 🇨🇳
Sooo what's the meme stock to close out this year?
It has a ton of short volume, I got in on Monday hoping it’d ride the EV wave and potentially squeeze like QS. Went in a few months ago but sold for a small profit, wish I’d just held my long-dated calls but happy with its current run.
Baba 215p... 80000%... If only..
Get that shit outta here.

Someone convince me not to put my entire portfolio into the BABA dip
How you doing?

Yes 100% this
Anybody else playing SATS and VSAT, satellite broadband for airlines and military, etc?  I'm buying it up for 50 cents on the dollar.
check the prices... and check the news china even stated they're almost done filling up capacity
Watching my money disappear with BABA is so painful to watch.
Yes, but at least they had the balls not to ask.
Are PLTR 1/29 40cs actually in the realm of possibility or have I lost my mind?

The pltr mm manipulation to keep it under 29 is so obvious but as long as they let it run next week we gucci
Can someone explain wtf happened to LOW
Well just got absolutely decimated since yesterday. Sold off majority of my positions and gonna go meditate for a bit. Don’t care if they moon, but really do care
TSLA and AAPL got it hard
No I'm not implying that.
ok XL fucked me
Lmao for a sec I thought I was on r/assassinscreed cuz thats all they ever post.
Can someone give me a summary? tldr
Ccp put pp in Jack Mas coke
BABA jumping up to $230 by EOD
As long as the printer is on: Never short.

  
Or if you want to short something, short the dollar. ITs losing value far faster than whatever your picking

Short BABA.
God damn PLTR stop blue balling me, please give me one more 🚀 day so I can get out! I promise I’ll be better next year
Something I'm not aware of for RYCEY?
Can someone explain to me why GameStop or GME is rocketing?
Real talk, real estate in CA/Bay Area or stonks?
Jack Ma was forced into retirement by Xi because he was taking up the spotlight and taking away power from CCP. But to prevent a power struggle, they let him stay as Board Director. They thought installing an army puppet with strong ties to CCP would eventually help them finally fully control Alibaba. Instead, CEO changed sides and worked with Ma to make a shell capital overseas and shifted all the ownership there. Baidu and Tencent, who form the big trio of B A T follow suit. Ma then comes out of "retirement" and hype a super power fintech IPO called Ant Group, that is a big fuck you to Xi especially when it consists of CEOs from different state companies that are market leaders. So now there is a power struggle, because if Xi loses then Capitalism will take hold fully.

GME wedge down forming. Get out of those calls

You are welcome!
You are winney the pooh gay bear Xi. Im sueing
Everything is dead over here in NVDA land. Volume is abysmal still I guess another month before a breakout toward PT
Bought it a couple of weeks ago and it expires at end of the day today. 
Your not seeing it because it’s unavailable. 31 Dec is the next call/put
lol https://i.imgur.com/GjOpq5o.jpg
Honestly, I think you'd make more doing that with PLTR. It's so much more predictable. Morning 5 min moons, then sell off in next 15, followed by day of slow recovery. Rinse n repeat every day.
[removed]
by who? Lmfao
Ughhh
John and Pete najarian fuck pussy don’t they
killed by baba

how much fucking lower is it gonna drop?!
Look at look the LMND's chart and volume before the middle of November and early. Now look at the chart $EVER and realize its fully recovered from their CEO kicking the bucket.

Imagine buying 220p BABA yesterday for a penny.
You could have literally bought just about any put on BABA yesterday and made a 50-100x bagger 

And here I am... holding PLTR
Damn Baba almost completely wiped out gains from the entire year
BABA literally has no buyers - it's terrifying to watch
To follow
So much fear about Chinese stocks, tencent down 5%. Great time to go all in
So SPY gonna give us a nice Christmas or pull the rug in the last 5 minutes like yesterday?
thank you for your service
Is CRSR doing the same garbage it did earlier this week where it goes down to $36 and them skyrockets to the $40s? I just gotta remember that its next earnings date is Feb 8th.
Ya wtf...
I’m in fuckers. MT to the moon 🚀🚀🚀

I need my AMZN calls next week to save my BABA calls to break even. Dangit!
Wait 20m
Bag holder confirmed.
why are you being so defensive lol it's a question, you do it when you're curious
When you say “don’t deprive the sub” you’re implying the sub has some inherent right to the bot, which it doesn’t. Ownership belongs solely to the creator
The delusion is strong with this one
You right that’s too far. Let’s get back to making autism jokes

BABA going to 0?
these are the kind of post i love. sheep to the slaughter.

It's only down 1%...
At least you can read. I never learned.

This...may not be the place for you.
Just buy the Dip
This GOEV dip boutta get bought the fuck up

Just means it’s gonna moon in the next few weeks.  Such ugly vehicles but who knows - stock could moon
For months we were arguing about the money printer until it sunk in. Rather than posting their losses like men, the bears faded into the background. All their BS explanations; 'its not really free money', 'its not actually a money printer', what a bunch of dumbasses

Hey, good for you. Make your own choices.
Ok I didn’t learn the hard way  made 200$ but also sadly missed out on 500$ profit. Don’t buy weekly ITM options for AAPL that expire in 3 days 😅
Its my birthday today. I went all in on XL stock this morning at $34.50 and just sold at 30.50 I lost 10% of my portfolio. Not a good way to start the day.
That’s racist homie

They both are baby
1000% 

But that’ll happen by Jan 6. That’s their merger date. And then it’ll dip to $18 two days after and then rip
Boring day. No MMs to steal our money.
I'll sell my what
Godspeed, fellow weeb, and may GME keep printing.
if i never made any bad trades I'd be so rich

That huge buy on OPEN has me hard, will be buying another 2k in stocks and 1k on calls today probably
Exactly...
Love it!
All talks with no positions
It’s gone up a bunch the last 6 months but it still has room to run. The valuation is stupid, we are talking about $100B company trading at $20 B because it’s still a show me story but look at the last earnings. They are showing and proving. Now is a great opp because we know about the investor day.
TANK U VERY MUCH BABA WE LUV U LONG TIME!
lmfao blatantly criminal pump and dump
Why would I Let her cum?
Love this, just started playing with the Robin stocks api yesterday. Thanks

I think some of my OTC stocks aren't marginable as well.

Got a couple of boomer stocks that will be getting assigned today unless the market 🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕 today.

I will throw some money at GME calls next week when I harvest the last of my tax losses and then after the first of the year when I realize some gains.

I am tapped out. Come on Santa rally, need some GME calls. 🎅🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🌕
This is the way
Go all in GME. Wait ~4 months. Win.

Not a fucking chance
Yeah, went from -50% for 0/15 90c up to -18%. Need a decent day next week.

Thanks! But I’m sure you mean buy high sell low.
It's going sub 200...
Yep.. guh
The one day I invest in gme is the day it doesn’t moon, can’t complain too much

Nice.
I like them to pop after earnings. Also, to gap up before earnings in anticipation.

Held it since it was $9 bucks to $70 bucks lol. I love $SQ but sometimes it needs a breather!
Puts on GME. I ordered two games and those motherfuckers sent a completely different game and forgot to put the other game in the box. Truly retarded
BABA$ DUDE HOLY FUCK!!!!
Do we think IPOC will crank to $20 by Feb??
I started playing with it in July/August... Had maybe 2k between 7.5 and 17.5 calls expiring Jan. Seeing meteoric rise last 2 weeks or so was waiting for a dip that has yet to come to rebuy in.
guh
GME won't stay above the VWAP.  I'm out have a merry Christmas.

Invitae actually has a very simple business: they extract your DNA and tell you what your gene sequences are. This is going to be a necessary first step in just about every new medical breakthrough so they will sell a lot of kits. On top of that the knowledge you gain by analyzing a database of these gene sequences will be immensely valuable.
commenting so I remember to come check this out later
Aptiv has new job openings for Resident Engineers in Cupertino, from their Signal and Power business unit.

Do with that what you will, but it sounds like AAPL is seriously kicking off at least the wiring harness and signal bus assemblies.
BABA really ded
If i had some cash id invest in baba but gme ate it all
\>  **Also, final point: #4**. **Have a plan and stick to it.** Do you know why you have paper hands? Because you do not have a plan.  

Ima be blunt, almost everything you said is bullshit, but this is gold. FAR too often I see people here panicking & acting emotionally. Thats a guaranteed lose
70% down doesn't sound like shares guy couldnt have been down that much in shares unless he margined up to the tits at ATHs

$90 eh? Feel bad for your puts...
Papa Elon, will we see 700 today?
I don't have the numbers other than what RH is telling me, but MCFE $25 calls 2/19 also up big today. Someone betting on cybersecurity market
I didnt have previous position, I bought in at 226. I'm betting itll be slap on the wrist. Hard to call it to be honest.
Holy shit I forgot about this gem of a game
Gonna file a lawsuit for Insider Information trading against this pooh bear name Xi, since the CCP obviously is loaded with BABA puts. 

I know Xi has a Robinhood account somewhere...
they bought tidal
More likely to be MVIS
You buy puts, MM shorts the stock
I am never buying SLV calls again.  Tired of riding that motherfucker.
Agree it’s been slow, but it has not pulled back with any significance. It is going to be a slow burn up and I have said so. This is not going to give you 20-30% swings in a day. It will pop after earnings. It will also gap up before as more info gets out in market.
PLTR swinging like a pregnant bitch
Sold GME 0dte for 33% gain. Jumped into some Tesla 0dte 670c. Butthole is puckered
Buy and Hold GME 💎 💎💎💎
Fair
It’s hitting all time high before close
Don't take my word on it tho nobody knows how the stock is going to move
The great BABA war has begun.

Thank god my baba calls are leaps Jesus
Most in here do. You'll.sell.your left but for 10 grand if you could

I rolled over in to March calls earlier this week.
So I should have really bought BABA puts at open 😭 

Congratulations to those who did 👏
SQ kick it in reverse for thirst please.
Nothing entitles me to it, I'm asking, not demanding.
I bought , fuck it
Why is no one talking about BLNK jesus
I hope the GOP lost senate seats in Georgia 

Clowns 🤡
Was gonna say, I’m getting slaughtered on my April calls lol
Same
I have no reason to trust you, but god damn it I'm in. I YOLO'd earlier last week on MT 2/19 $29c and 1/15 VALE $20c but I'm starting to think I may have been too optimistic that early. Are March and April calls the move?
What if big stonk is mooning because Chinese competition just took a small slap with chinas gov quick scoping baba
Can Papa take us to the 700 promise land today
Yeah then you pay under that very cool joe Biden tax plan
We just riding the brexit trade deal rn, this is going to fade at this volume
i haven't held a put overnight since march so you do you, but i am not touching this until it is under 200
That’s my golden rule. Don’t buy puts. You can hedge with vixy calls
Lost almost 6K in 2 days after an over 25K run in 3 months.  Merry Christmas Congress
However also should have bought the 220p 0dte I wanted to as well but figured why turn a losing play into a play at risk of losing more.
i'm being downvoted by other people who don't know....lol
Gme
Long on calls and shares
Imagine not buying fubo right now
i hope he doesn't answer this. get in or get out
I was just in a GameStop last night, sold out of everything, hiring for 3 positions.
Anyone else having the worst fucking week of their lives? Maybe it’s cuz I’m Jewish and this week is Christmas but Jesus Christ this is the fucking horse shit!

Yeah I'm buying cyber punk for Christmas
Robinhood starting to slip up
Under reported? It’s literally been everywhere and you’re like 3 weeks late, you retard.
buy leaps on RKT now
Just think of it as investing and on ya way
True but risky as hell
Like oh shit pull out?
AAPL 133 gang
Good ole Melon sneaking up his price while everyone looking at China.....
Good time to stock up on FCEL?
Those meme stocks were crazy this year. Glad you could make a profit on them.
Thankfully sold my calls when stock was
Around $20. Looking to enter sub $18
Is stock market open today?
[deleted]
Qqqj what the fuck bro why so flaccid
I don't think I'd buy BABA until it hits like 150 or lower. You guys realize China isn't the US, right? They will just fucking destroy the company if they want to. Insanely risky.
I loaded up on shares at 214 in April. Then reloaded with 400c LEAPs when it dipped from 319 to 290. That's sitting at -80% right now...
Yea it might be the time to enter soon. I bet CCP did this so that they can buy some shares. Baba is too big to kill cuz it’s a money maker for them .
Still 4 trading days left of the year
[deleted]
Yes, but hedge funds and shorts out for blood after the loss they incurred from  shorting at 50 and shorting at 70. Homeless speed runners.
Haha I minimized my risk over the weekend by selling friday, planned to buy the dip but paper handed real quick by buying in same price monday evening. Ah well, it's not like I'm a day trader anyways
Because a lot of motherfuckers are buying them thinking BABA will bounce at least a little bit.
tesla doing the thing again!
Too late to buy into this today?
MY TENDIES
[removed]
I have always stayed away from Chinese stocks no matter how attractive they low
But like when is this
Day ain’t over. This shit box finishes sub 650
Dyslexia is tough though.  He probably meant QS
TSLA you s3xy slut!
I think you’re late.

Go read the recent news
Talk to them
VLDR just ruined Xmas
At least I’ve secured 2 years of write offs this year :) fuck my life and fuck 2020 man how did I not make money this year
BABA isn’t shitty
Looks like selling BABA calls at open was the right play. Second guessed myself but glad to be rid of it now.
Load up on SQ chaps🌝
Feel you breh
Thanks, this run gives me hope but eh
Went from 35 to 230 in a few months.
All that santa rally spamming for 2 weeks. U guys shouldnt breed
I was so convinced baba leaps were the play yesterday
They have not announced a date yet it said early 21 I bought calls for 1/15/21 and June just to be safe.
Brexit deal went through. RYCEY to 100 EOY
It’s not going to go down, but I will say it’s unlikely to do anything today. Once volume picks back up on Monday there should be fireworks it’s just a matter of what kind
Maybe those v bounces were the rallies
any good at cooking pizza ? This guy Dominos
#IPOC pump it CHAMATH
My 0dte would appreciate this
I hate fidelity. On a fast moving stock they always fill you at ATH
[removed]
The volume on BABA. Damn.
What did Jack Ma do wrong? Was he competing against the chinese banks with his company? In any case, it would be hard to break up ALibaba or hurt Jack Ma in any way cause that would piss off a lot of other people that are bringing money in China. I'd buy this dip
hmmm. Up until now when I did SPACs i only bought shares. Maybe I should do calls.
Sick company tbf I’m in
What did you say about BB?
This BLNK ride is unreal.  I just wish i had more than 1 contract.
Someone tell me if a Chinese company talks shit about their government so I can buy puts on that company
I am pounding the table to buy baba
Rookie numbers. Apha sometimes throws off all gainz. Perfect wsb stock.
i feel like i should get on this. I'm on RH...how do i do this without fucking it up?
Just hang on
son: daddy y no christmas presents this year  ? 😥

father: i'm sorry son santa died   \*(in reality he was holding baba calls)\*
I'd buy into a company that is going to build underground cities. Real estate on the surface is too expensive, building up sucks too, let's go the other direction. If ancient people could have underground cities, imagine what we could accomplish now.
Im on the train and people next to me are talking about how much money they made in the stock market. The top is in
So what you guys think if a Gov shutdown happens... impact on SPY? Deep dive?? 

Took a small hedge on spy 305p jan 21! 

Btw for the retards out there I don’t expect spy to hit 305 just more intrinsic value to far OTM versus close ITM in such low IV
Bought JD dip instead of baba
Oh you said paper lol, I thought you meant 💎
Stimmy going limp
Palantir was founded 2 years after the Patriot Act (allowing for mass collection and inspection of data without consent or warrant). They were considered the MOST secretive company in Silicon Valley for years, for good reason. 

They are/were in bed with the federal government and aided in bringing together all the data that the surveillance state collects into a usable format. Snowden talked about how difficult it was to sift through all this data and Palantir is solving for that. Now they are trying to bring this to the public sector, and I bet they will dickstomp any competition.

TL;DR - Palantir was born a surveillance tool for the government to track us better with the mass data they collect without our consent. Now that they have the US feds locked in, they go for ally nation state govs and US based public sector.

Edit: word misspelled
[deleted]
Nope. I bought 1k shares. Thinking of selling calls, but don’t think I want to hold these shares that long. Wish I could sell weeklies. Jan 15 is earliest expiry. What did you sell?
What’s your expected reaction?

Stimulus deal for USA is in shambles right now so if you were expecting ripping green then I imagine it would be muted by political wrangling but I could be wrong.
So what do I do with LULU
Algos just fuking us 12/24 47c holders

Jack Ma fucked around and caught some old school China shit.... get out if you can, they are the tank... he is the student.... this ends poorly
Called the TSLA rip lol
Jesus Christ CRSR ahahahha I’ve got shares but at least do something
Yeah I’m losing hope
Best of luck homie. Rooting for ya
gamestop short squeeze pls
190-205
Why is SQ fucking me
Yeah never gonna be able to time it perfectly. I bought at 226. 
Basically if its just gonna be a slap on the wrist, it will moon back up to 300+

If not, then well you lose money regardless of what point you bought in today.
Baba
190-205 range
Lol @ bark box post getting removed. Seemed like decent DD at first, that guy pulled off a 20% gain on like 1.5 mil in a day, you best believe he dumping at any given moment.
Why
[removed]
China will never take over if they dont let their companies fuck them in their ass.
Sad
[removed]
Honestly it's up to you. Personally I'd wait for it to bounce back and then sell but that might not happen
Hold these aapl 132c that expire 1/8 or sell?
They blocked the increase from 600 to 2000

As they should, we've printed enough fucking money
TSLA legit closing all time high
Regardless of the amount, that's a very nice roi. Well done
The real reason not to sell: taxes. Push cap gains to 2021 with not having to worry about paying until 2022.
Well the retards here provided liquidity probably

Either way all these spacs are like penny stocks, sure there are a few good ones there, but not worth it (imo)
Who’s holding MGNI 1/15 calls? What’s your strategy? I’ve been holding some 22c for about a month now and they are up bigly. Wonder how much this run has left in it...
Buying Jan $270 calls probably isn't the move
I had 5500 shares in July or so around $6. I sold them under $10 to “diversify” 🤡🤡🔫
Baba wat u doin bb
Its pretty crazy how 9-12 month out calls still swing 5-10% any given day even with the slightest of movement on stock.
I agree, but leap calls are big $$$
What’s up with SQ
Is Ghi.v rkt 2.0?
SPACers taking profits.  Give it a month.
but papa only abusive us cause he loves us.

So if i buy 50k puts, MMs will sell those to me?
IPOC!!!!
That’s what you get for holding shitty Chinese stocks. All in America 🇺🇸🇺🇸🇺🇸
Thank you! Please update I'd love to know what little nuggets about PLTR he has in there!
The CCP really hate Christmas huh.
Looks like a Christmas tree on its side. Therefore PLTR will moon shortly after Christmas when everyone is taking down their trees.  Obligatory 🚀🚀🚀
I sold a bunch of 670 calls that I'm regretting right now. This feels like last week when it hit 690
Oh I like you
Hey what do I know, but I think you'll be alright. These calls aren't going to start moving until the underlying moves and that won't happen for at least a few more weeks. I'm way negative on June calls but it'll turn around when $MT rockets.
[deleted]
I’ve been shilling this shit for days. Hope somebody listened. I think it’ll hit $60 next week.
PDD puts, will dip back down after the baba hype cools down

I'm gonna bet we invested in different stocks.

Nah sorry all my money is in GME and PLTR
holy crap gme has the potential to hit $25 today

Literally my life rn
not worth it with this IV
my sq and aapl calls have canceled each other out
No, can we change to GAY?
This is why I never use TA for selling my TSLA covered calls.  TSLA defies logic. I stick to Dr Patel’s advice.  Always set TSLA weekly strike at $200 above current share price. Used this method weekly since May. Guaranteed tendies and shares never get called away.
TSLA 670 by 1200 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I would, but can't trade options on them :(
[deleted]
Im holding the same SPACs, any thoughts on an exit price?
They’re called europoors for a reason
Baba loves to bleed. We'll see, I think it could head for 200 over the next week
Yup great time to buy
No thanks!
The idea of PLTR suddenly ripping seems like a fantasy
Fuck Amzn and NIO today
Trump doesn't need to sign the relief bill. He could absolutely avoid getting his veto overridden by not even signing it at all, and letting the government shutdown by Monday.
GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀
So I shouldn’t have jumped in to cleanenergy at $8.50, guess I didn’t buy the dip.
so buy calls?
Yea i said caonima to BABA
You'll prob regret paper hands rn
Correct
MT is now my biggest position in my modest portfolio! Let's go!!
💎💎 >!GME ICLN BB TLRY!<  💎💎
Get out of BABA now, shit has been bad since last week when they found out that its app is spying on people
Okay Buddy you can do it
Hearing Cramer ramble about anything is fucking painful. Period.  That's your problem right there.
Waiting for the Trump Merry Christmas ya Filthy Animal tweet to rug pull this fake market
Oh fuck BABA has left the chat and banned himself lmfao
Stld only goes down. Fuck my calls apparently
It will go down big before Jan 15 lol

Someone's gonna go after it again
BABA at the bottom finally
Fuck you thanks
Yeah i yell at them to go up, but they ignore me
Just rage bought AMZN as a revenge move on BABA
Nobody tell him

What are your thoughts on 3/21 28c? It’s been pretty slow the past week
[deleted]
Sell your BABA shares then rebuy them since a lower average looks cool and you get tax breaks for securing losses
Wth
Freinds?
That's the kind of Xmas im used to the past 2 years. Glad to be on the other side. Good luck
That was yesterday news.... today GOP blocked the $2000 stimmy bill
Same. I thought the MSFT news was seriously bad for chip makers. Not immediate effects, but it shows a trend
I think PDD too. I bought a few Jan 170c yesterday on a alert for 200. Their like quadruple today😂
Nope, MM not going to let ptlr hit $30 today. I'd be surprised if it holds $28. Definitely hitting 30 next week though.
Who the fuck buys stocks?
Get him a air fryer or something
Dems are having a field day with the GOP infighting lmao. Trump burnt him and the GOP with him

oops
Loading up
BABA a falling knife. Puts are free money imo.
Stock and calls at $30 and $40 on multiple months
You are welcome!  Merry Christmas! 🎁🎄🚀
Not like anything you do with it matters. It’s not even real money
Can you update me when/if I should buy please. I want to be cautious with my last play today. No day trades left. $435 in account remaining to use right now
We close at 370
BLNK turning the thrusters into overdrive
anyone else feeling a huge selloff about 5-10mins before close?
I think that part of it is the primal satisfaction of ripping something apart. Rather than discourage it, we just kind of embrace it now. Cheap toys, 1 day to get the squeaker out, two days to get the stuffing out, and about two weeks of tossing the empty husk around until it’s no longer recognizable and we toss it.
For the long hold, it is easy money.
QS about to take off 🚀
$TSLA about to rip higher :)
I’ve bought too much BABA. AMA.
Dude, how??
merci bohcoo
Bought the dip on baba but it’s still dipping
I’m mad I didn’t buy FL

I fuckin liked that company when Cramer talked about it like a week ago too
well pltr was green for like 2 seconds

Hmmm....how bout that NKLA dip?? Thinking about bagholding for an autistic pump loll
You guys ever talk to your stocks?

My Baba shares are down 25%. Should I sell or sell other shares to buy this dip
Butt Plug
It looks like market doesn't care about Brexit deal done
2 week out baba calls still expensive
Think we’ll see a bounce on XL?
Get out of BABA. Only gonna get worse.
This is 10x or bust territory - go balls deep in calls on nvax
This is your last chance to go all in on TSLA
2 grand per option holy fuck lmfao
Maybe took some profits off the top, but I doubt they dumped it. It really feels like a BECKY stock like LULU or PLTN.
Unusual whales alert on 2/19 FEYE 24c. $1.3M bet

Truee i bought at 647 and it goes down to 645? Retarded
i think everyone knows gamestop has close to 0 relevance in today's video game market, everyone is buying counting on a promise of some jerk who made an ecommerce site to somehow revolutionize the gamestop platform and compete with already established ones like steam and origin.... talk about counting chickens before they hatch. this stock is caca

but i still have calls today because stocks dont make sense

Bought the dip at lower prices with multi-monthlies. No bueno
what is it merging with?
Superb post
Well if she cheats it's a good idea but if she cheats and lets you put it in the pooper then bad idea.
For real.  Cannot believe those Kentucky Fried Fucks reelected Bitch McConnell.

Remember last year when Mango tweeted out on 26th that it was the best e-shopping holiday of all time?

My PTON, AMZN, and SHOP calls hope for a repeat.
That's... actually a completely fair point. I retract what I said op, you smart.
Elon, give me another push. Just get it to 670
That’s literally why wsb exists you retard
Definitely. Although learning options could be monumental. I’ve done the exact opposite, no shares only options, and am up about 450% since March.
Positions retard
Kinda weird to get my dad underwear lol
Elon wants to do a deal with AAPL. Mark it.

TSLA and AAPL going to Mars. Literally.
STLD and CMC are the US stocks to buy. X is over valued. IMHO
how sure of that are u
Merry Christmas and Happy NewYear. i hope you make up your wins in the future. But please take a screen shot and share it with us please.
Buy the dip
Anyone else getting killed today?
[deleted]
Because of the -4% yesterday? Where do you value them?
BLNK and you'll miss it! Paper handed myself out if like 40k by selling calls at 300% instead of the 3000% they're at now 🤡
Wipe your ass with it and just buy more shares 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
I would love to see the Grand Canyon some day. My biggest returns have been NIO, TSLA, SPCE, XPEV, and PLTR. Just been lucky enough to buy when they’re hot and sell before the drop. I’m in on ARK (all 5) and TAN now and just gonna let things coast up.
IM NOT SELLING
If you bought and held leaps from March you'd be up 7500% from March.
ew. my condolences
has to break 29.2
The best Dip for 2020 is BABA. don't miss it
Yaaa my calls not doing so hot
Stop loss at $28 on pltr. 5 min chart shows a nice little bullish reversal. If it fails there, I’ll wait another day to hop in
Anybody have any good autistic share buys? FSR and GRWG looking like top candidates.
This is going nowhere. There is no santa rally. All of it was bullshit
Honestly the market is just algos fucking with retards that know will buy high and sell low. And that includes me
You guys are such pussies, if you sold on most stocks you’re going to be crying after Xmas. Just hold and watch shit go higher not hard, stomach the red days the dip gets bought up
Its not a lot but im doing the best I can with 46 shares 💎💎💎🤚🤚🤚
Wish I timed it better but this is fine 🚀
FCEL has been an interesting ride. DOE interest should make it fun for a bit.
Dude Idk what I’d do. Post update ig

That was all you needed to know.
A good flashlight. Surefire or Streamlight. Don't know you need a good light until you have one.
Buy high sell low merry Xmas
You should feel great about that, but you’d be up 750% if you bought options.
You were long shares and sold? Why?
Lots of selling. I'd like to get some 1/15 calls.

I love AMD as much as the next guy and made a lot of money off it in the past. That said I really do think it’s going to be flat for quite a while, like months. 2 of the worlds largest companies have both said they basically will be making their own chips moving forward, and they absolutely have the money/resources to buy the talent necessary to do so.

That’s a lot of potential lost revenue for INTC and AMD. I think theta gang wins on AMD for a while.
G H I V

mad strenght
I don’t yolo often but when i do, I sell that shit immediately if it rockets. 27% gain this morning, I wasn’t trying to be greedy. This is in my IRA so shit is tax free too.
wow i had great fun riding tsla to 650+, and then thought it should drop down since s&p was the only news that brought it up 70%. guess my dumbass was wrong :/
Literally buy calls we're closing green today it's Christmas Eve
It’s a hobby for me. I enjoy it. I’ve been doing it for friends for years. With everything going on this year - I thought I would try and help give back. My 17 year old son, who also invests, follows all this shit on Reddit. Maybe I have picked the wrong sub and should just post on stocks. Anyhow, Merry Christmas.

I got in at 14. Just sold yesterday. May revisit with some leaps
When are the retards covering?
💩
Holding shares at an average of $18. I feel good about the future.
Everything is up ... hard to differentiate. I look at it like this .. the downside is probably into low 40s or high 30s I don’t see it dropping more than that worse case scenario. There are a couple $50 and $60
Price targets from respected funds in the last couple days.  But the upside is definitely there - look at roku. If they can secure some good content deals or get into sports betting as they are planning to, this easily runs to 100. Risk Reward play. Perhaps play it safe with shares or longer dated options.
When is it
 Desending triangle on GME, full on war between bulls and bears rn. If it does break through to the upside, expect ~23 ish target. If it fails to, 18.50-19, and slow bleed downwards
Gme has a long way to go
Sir, this is a casino.

For real tho, who is listening to citron??
Bft gonna give us a new bottom every day next week

APHA casually throwing off half its gain from yesterday.
Most people would be happy with 10% in a year.

Playing GME daily is fun, make money every 10 mins buy dip at 20.8-20.5 sell at 21+ ...rinse n repeat

Is there a good iPhone app for tracking option premiums? Like the yahoo finance of options
I don’t think you have to worry, after 2 +20% days and still not dumping I’d say it’ll hold pretty solid. Plus, like someone pointed out, we have a (very) thin chance of shorts covering today.

Why did you guys sell tsla??? Wheres my retards who bought the dip yesterday 🚀 🚀
$134.84
Totally different governments in the US. Papa Pooh Bear can do whatever the fuk he wants. Our government is an oily sack of farts with big techs giant dong inside it. Daddy ma angered the most powerful dictator in the world and now he's dealing with the consequences.
Tell me about this company if you would. Nobody talks about it but Cathie owns a shit ton of it. I can’t find news on it when it’s up or down. I’m trying to enter a position.
Fuck LightShed Partners for dissing FUBO!
Woo TSLA 🚀 🚀 🚀
Pahmp eeeeet.
Up significantly early, what else is new. Can’t wait to see how I end up getting fucked today
Thanks Vito, I appreciate the informative posts keep em coming. Merry Christmas! 🎄🚀🚀🚀🚀
thank fuck i sold sq at open

We shall see fellow autist, we shall see.
when are we getting in BABA? 220s?
Alibaba investors not having a good day or month.  But if you invest in China. This is a big real risk.  The government can do whatever it wants. Xi will protect his power. $baba
sounds like the future to me, even though what I am worried about is that it might not be 'the real thing' (yet). the whole thing has definitely struck a nerve though. Say I subscribe to some financial/economic/meteorological data API. Who can tell me that I am getting all the data that ideally matches my requirements at the given expenses? What if there is a better provider, who can guarantee to me a broader access to data at an equally reasonable fee, where I do not have to worry about adapting my code to changing requirements and endpoints every now and then?

I feel that Palantir definitely has potential here. I think it is beginning to have the brand recognition aspect going for itself. Also, it is filling a niche that a lot of people knew was there but no other yet (publicly listed) company was ready to (recognizably) fill. So they are a first-mover in a market that is only going to grow, and it is actually specializing on this task. So while you have established giants who could break this mold, I think Palantir is driving a wedge into this business right now and there is a lot of potential there. Then comes the fact that they are a publicly listed company, which initially solves the problem of the capital-intensive nature of this business. I personally think there is a lot of inertia right now in the market's valuation of Palantir, but it is about to catch some serious tailwinds in the coming year.

One of the many things that I am not sure about is the moral aspect to their business. For instance I dont ever buy weapon manufacturer stocks, but as we know there is a lot of grey area there when considering what one thinks is 'evil'.
Go for feb. Biden gonna pump

It’s been all over the place. Buying what’s hot and selling when I think the run is over. Most has come from TSLA, NIO, PLTR, XPEV, and now I’m in on all the ARKs and TAN.
[removed]
Yesss sell when it’s down! Lol
They should totally go into business together. GME could use PLTR’s data intelligence to figure out what the f*ck they’re doing wrong and PLTR could get into video games which is a bigger industry than even movies.

Please stop being so pathetic, it's almost making me sad
Just now?
Below 50% IV is good for large cap stocks. Its way better than tesla. + chinese regulation is swift and decisive. Everything looks priced in already after this massive drop. Baba is almost at at its 1 years ago level. Good risk reward.
**TSLA**
Yea i could sense that cos it didnt make much sense. I probably would sound like an imbecile if i were interviewed in Spanish or what.

Merry Christmas my retards. Love you all and stay safe out there! :)
Cuz he pumped and dumped it
This is so cool, great idea. You have my shareholder vote.
Feel like Baba could be the most epic long term dip buy ever but I'm not touching it right now. Will be watching it closely
Sold TSLA too early :(
Big changes are coming to GME. You might want to find a different non-volatile play but if you like losing money, that’s on you.
yes

Tim Apple?
I'm not Sherlock Holmes or anything but it seems pltr drops everyday at open....
Legit worried about y all BABA fans anuses. Is Wacko Jack Ma sending barrels of lube?
Just sold my long position for a 70% loss.  Fuck it, all in on RIOT calls
All TSLA bears will be crying when we close at 680 today
There is an implicit fallacy in the phrase "to the moon". Like the sun the moon rises as well as falls. At least from our earthly perspective.
buy 10 share of GME if you read this
me too. he's in florida so i can blame fedex.
Hell this almost qualifies as DD!
I think 4Q is gonna be awful maybe even 1Q but I agree potential 10 bagger here in 5 years if you can hold through. Great brand great product. MGMT going through layoffs. Could be a great turn around story.
Falling wedge on CRSR. Should reverse soon
Step-NIO what are you doing
Like an idiot placed a market order for my STIC stock and now I’m down. Hope this rockets soon
It went
What about March ? Or is rolling to June the move ?
Coffee mug, socks, coffee machine if you bought gme, shirts...
I don't play options with ARK. But i started buying weekly a couple weeks back. ARKK/F/G.
What's your breakeven?
Most of the money made in a bubble is being long
Bought 11 shares (that’s a lot for new retards such as myself), then bought my sister and my parents gift cards for their new dogs... because everyone got fucking dogs while being in the pandemic. Was going to get them a chewy GC too, but fuck that... that doesn’t make us any tendies.

Thank you for this Christmas gift u/sir_jack_a_lot , May your tendies be plentiful and your autism shine brightly.
just bought a june $420c at .69 for the lulz
Why are people buying SQ?

What’s up with NVTA? Can’t find shit on it and I’m trying to enter a position.
Yep fun game back in the day
think i kinda overpaid for those LGVW calls  fkkk
Yes.
Imma need a bit more than 1% after the last couple days tho
Bought BABA bull call spreads in March. Let’s see what happens.
Regret selling TSLA already. Its like that break up that you're not sure if it was a good idea or not.
REEEEEEE JD REEEEEEEE🤬😡🤬😡🤬
I’ll take pennies at this point
In Papa Elon we trust🙏🏼
Yo what should I get my dad for Christmas? Need legit ideas

Edit: these are decent ideas fellas but this guy buys himself whatever he wants the instant he wants it. I need something obscure he wouldn’t even think of lol.
Show me where BABA touched you
I've learned my lesson
ah i see. but possible to just buy, exercise and sell later for a profit right?
lambos are the steel horses we’ll ride in valhalla
Sell and get back in early next week. It may have a small recovery today but it's not done dropping.
Some dude bought $6.25M worth of BABA  Jan 2022 270c leaps , time to follow this play
Fuck no

He broke subreddit rules but I don’t think this was a pure pump play but who fucking knows. The moment it got more mainstream coverage it became an obvious p&d. 

Still a killing anyway getting in at 14.25 yesterday.
What the fuck Square 

Pump the fuck up 💰🟩💰
Good buying opportunity on SQ
Still holding all bc why not, at 1100 rn
Let me ask you this, how do we know its not pumping like everything else did after election/vaccine?
i bought the dip from like 2 months ago
he's in the Senate, the House rejected the additional measure. as much as i love to hate on Moscow Mitch McTurtle, this wasn't him...of course, it was republicans nonetheless

Because the open interest is basically zero look at the spread

just waiting for that daily Tesla crash 20mins before close

edit: actually here it comes now what do you know
I need RIOT to go up and PLTR to go down a little
What stonks and yes
Yeah I’d say definitely buy a bit of both stocks and options. Maybe it’ll have a small correction at some point but I think within the first 90 days Biden is going to make tons of announcements that will be huge for clean energy. I have stock in my roth and then Feb, April and July 2021 calls. Might load up on even more today
Yo CCP u guys bought enough BABA shares and calls yet? DM me when u are done
The OG investors are saying to wait. I’ll wait till next week. I’ll just sell puts on SQ today and get some free money.
Umm that’s it STIC?

Dude relax there is like two algos at Goldman running right now that’s it,
pretty much what i'm doing. got 80 shares at $270. so willing to wait and see how low this POS will go before I can start selling CC at least.
Time for BABA calls yet?
#TSLA 🎄 

If it breaks above the $659 level, it’s going to try for new ATH today! Wasn’t planning on playing it today but I saw my neighbor installing the new Tesla roof and it inspired me...🚀
Profit is profit. Merry Christmas tard 🤝
Congrats homie!!
That would be me sir.
holy shit yea Im out SQ
I’m going balls to the wall in AMZN calls EOD
Well done. Whats that logo middle right?
Trust me, we gucci in a few hours man. I'm up on my 131c but only put 1 option. Waiting for 133c to get a bit closer. I'll let you know when I'm out
I’m never touching BABA again 😬
I can imagine it. My calls were down 50% and I just didn't want to dump more money in. These half trading days with expected low volume after a red day are easy pump days. Now I know.
You don't you just keep making worse decisions that's why the first ones always free
Guys you should watch Fox Business and buy puts on any stock they pump. They tried to pump SNE just now
Point being, we all know US trust lawsuits on big tech are bullshit. 

China on the otherhand... There is a lot of risk still.
do not buy TSLA today

Sell call credits on the rip
Well we are off to a fucking nice start this Christmas Eve. With any luck the early close today will come before the inevitable fake and gay eod sell off
ARKK just doesnt have red days
Fuck 😮
Wrong way, APHA.

🤬
and if MF's getting banned because of a hookup... well... shit, getting them Martha Stewart feels.
Nicely done! From only stocks, what did you buy into? Tsla? Visiting the grand canyon has been my dream for years
Nice, congrats! I just bought more calls, feeling serious FOMO from when I sold my QS calls after it hit $75
Godspeed you valiant fuckers.
the trend is your friend
Hmm yes, can’t go tits up
Because 1. Chinese investing culture is different. 2. The state media in China reports differently than US corporate media
It’s one step up, two steps down, three steps up, etc

Hoping to jump back on Monday. I'm a poor degenerate retard sloshing around with a cash account and have to wait for funds to settle.

That said, bite me coinz have options that expire tomorrow so I'm hoping it doesn't rocket again before I can jump back on the MARA tendies train.
Or cash account.

I traded some BA calls & stonks on the morning bounce to the tune of \~$600 profit.

So, because I believe the next month until the Trump transition risk poses understated risk, I dumped the $600 into 1/22/21 IWM deep OTM puts.  155 contracts!!

Let's see if the tail risk bet pays off for me, at least I have my downside covered.

Ok so fuck this market. I’m out. Have a good one
Bottom for GME? Seems to have a a lot of support at 20.6

Sir jack alot has been BANNED for promoting PUMPS AND DUMPS
Republicans on Thursday rejected Democrats’ long shot effort to add $2000 stimulus checks to the $900 billion stimulus package after President Donald Trump threatened to veto the legislation unless Congress increased the direct payments, throwing the passage of the aid deal into peril just days before the government is set to shutdown, and unemployment checks for millions of Americans run dry.

Fuck, I should have shorted BABA last night.
That’s an incredible return! Great job
If all you retards think BABA is doomed just look at FB and GOOG that has similar lawsuits going on and in US unlike fake Chinese lawsuits. Algos will get you all so bad if everyone jumps in puts for BABA.

It’s AAPL of China and is up these in the big leagues. One anti trust law suit doesn’t mean their printers will turn off at all. Come next reporting period and it go brrrrerrrrr.

That’s a fair assessment but that doesn’t prevent another 50% drop through brexit.

SPACs are ripppin
You could push it a little further out to February so you can play the earnings runup a bit more? That’s the call I have at least, it’s been going crazy lately though I did buy a couple weeks ago. I think you might be fine though, next week should be another good week for AAPL, assuming stimulus talks don’t go terribly. They should have more to run with new products, EV hype, potential that they’ll smash earnings with iPhone sales
Serious question, why would baba drop more (13%) here than in China (8%), aren’t they the same company and aren’t we going off of their news?
People here do not talk about fraud enough. On every bit of news or post we see, there is the risk that its an out n out lie. Right not now you might have a BS filter that works, but the liars will only get more sophisticated

Proof? I don’t doubt it I just want to feel better about my baba call options loss
Not poor enough to get poor people stimulus checks, not rich enough to get rich people hand outs :/
Yes
Welp. Sold baba at open and bought msft. That's an american play right?
Now that it’s in the s&p, I’m gonna be more careful

This shit is retarded. Rallying for nothing like always. Goes up on stimulus hopes, then unmoved when nothing happens.
Lisa for the love of god you need to get it together
I am pretty sure it must be 🌈bears on this sub. You cant be that retarded if you have a institution.
Ya I got about the opposite of good play on them. Bought some slightly out of the money calls 30 to 45 days out (this was around thanksgiving/first of December) and they have dropped like 20% as a stock in that time. 100% loss on the options.

Great news hits my TV, their stock drops. I can't figure it out
I’m not a believer in max pain but total volume of call contracts that have been sold went up about 10x is this week.  It won’t stop the rocket, but it can slow it down... also it’s up an amazing amount in a short time.  I have faith.
Weaksauce
If that money is on shares, go for it.

Shares?
[removed]
Well, then I will ask you: who would sell 31k puts on GME? For every buyer there is a seller. Looks more like someone who is short big in GME is selling puts to cover his short position and someone who is long big in GME is trying to secure a high price for his shares.
Bullish
What are you positions?
Apex too ducking gapped up
Long game so don’t worry friend
Also, this is not the place to ask for advice generally. You risk the ban hammer.
Whatcha mean?
Yes, she will destroy those too. Except for the one you put peanut butter in... I think she realized destroying that would be unwise.
The way you post with such enthusiasm every single day about steel makes me incredibly nervous, but everything you say tracks and the DD makes sense. I put $5k on calls a few days ago and am down about 20% from IV crush but I believe that this one will work out. Godspeed you moron, please keep giving us steel updates and we’ll race Lamborghinis after this is all over

They are going to be wrong, until they are right. Being wrong can be very expensive, and they likely won’t make back enough to cover being wrong.

Personally I think Alibaba is huge. It's even gaining traction in western countries as a source for super cheap stuff. If I don't need something quickly, I'll order it on aliexpress as it'll be a third of the price as on amazon or ebay. 

I would invest but I'm a bit scared because I'm autistic and retarded and have no idea what this news means and why investors have so little trust in alibaba.
I love you so much cloudy boi
Which is the plan. The go to for everything gaming. It's just a matter of if they can reach it. Cohen increases the chance.

oh my BABA
If my crayon holds out don't jump in until around $18
I concur with the PLTR its pretty safe bet. If you want to dip your toes into some volatility and risk, go GME.
I don’t think American investor understands that when CCP GOVERMENT fucks with u 

It’s not like here in the USA where google and Facebook get probes every Monday and pay and fine and tell em to fuck off

All GME shares all day every day. Shorts are out of shares to short, resorting to puts. Writing is on the wall they're doomed. Follow RC into tendie town! $GME to the 🌕

Lmfao. Sounds about right. You gotta have a country accent real or fake to talk on there or else they shit on you. My neighbor has the biggest ham radio set up in the world. Basically a cell phone tower. Talks all over the world. That’s too nerdy for me lol but when I’m on a long road trip the CB is fun.
12 shares or 12 years old?

Both are normal around here.
No reason but I lost money
Yeah this is at a discount
Yuppp
Thank you. Appreciate the super fast reply and advice.
That's worth some YOLOING.
Yeah.  That's why short interest alone isn't sufficient for the sort of squeeze that happened in VW.

The "GME is Blockbuster 2.0" thesis was dead wrong, and the "this will squeeze to $50 overnight" thesis is dead wrong.

I wouldn't have even sold this @ 21.85 if it weren't for that pervasive thinking, actually.  I would have just held to $24.

But, this is looking a lot like there may be a chance to re enter below $20 again.  And I'll be able to take more shares.

There's going to be a lot of buyers who lose patience waiting for this squeeze to take it a lot higher, IMO.
$33 potential?
Positive.
Averaging down on OPEN yesterday is paying off a little 🙏🏼
I lost 7k on BABA and counting.

Time to double down!
Never touching China again lol
If you like losing money
Some obviously did. There are some technical traders that clearly bought back heavily once the market moved up 4% from the bottom.
I’m praying it does ;(
They have a massive recall right now on faulty seat belts. Lowest rates truck for 2021.

It's just marinating. Give it two weeks and sell some OTM covered calls if you get antsy

Gotta test your product 😂

I bought 1k shares at 1.71. I was up 208% at one point and highly considered selling but I was like nah fuck it I’m gonna hold and see where this goes. If it somehow dips anywhere near what I bought at I’m probably going to load another 2500 shares or so and just not care what happens over the next year or so. Cannacorp put up 90 mil at 4.40 or somewhere around there so I think this is really going somewhere big.
Here for you bro. You’ll come back from this. I believe in you!
Cathie no buy more BABA pleas
This year I've made a little over 7k, going from 10k to 7k. I dont even wild plays like post of you. It's been an insane year. Looks like I can go on a road trip to the grand canyon during the summer now
Nice
Hey dude. Thanks for tips!! However that’s Marvell(tech group) not Marvel (Iron Man).
buy the FEYE dip

also probably BABA idk
Just bought 12/24 $26c

Is BABA gonna be okay?  I have 30 shares now cause I avg down but honestly still a little nervous for the long term

But u have to take into account the true value of gamestop. They have no console they basically just resell stuff what value do they have honestly. I would understand if they were developing some console and assembling a gamestop gaming subsidiary but they aint.

They make airplane engines. Everything associated with an airplane took a huge dive this year, Boeing included. They are a stupid company , don’t get me wrong, but I bought in for cheap. The uk backing makes it a penny stock with an insurance policy. At least that’s how I chose to look at it.
HOW THE FUCK IS BEST BUY DOWN EVERY MOTHER FUCKING DAY
Fed suing them for opiates, such a joke.
It definitely has more room to drop. All it takes is another news article from China and it drops another 10%. I'm probably going to wait until it seems like this China stuff blows over.
Then you’re fine..the play is Q1
Not likely to happen today. Low vol and markets closing early
Not necessarily... TSLA would just have to make a monumental move today for you to make a profit.
I was being snarky on the difficulty of getting a console earlier...they need to get their act together and start pushing PC stuff and sell NVDA and AMD stuff.

If you buy 30000 worth of shares your gonna bump the price a bit and that should make people happy, but what do I know

Oh no my weekly is expiring worthless how did i not see this coming
most of the DOW is down. a risky (but potentially lucrative long hold is ba)
I don't think staying in BABA is the best play. CCP already stopped ANT's IPO and has not been afraid to flex on businesses. Also, the market is already hot with JD and PDD gaining market share in that space. It's a little different than AMZN's market dominance in the Western Hemisphere; who's actually using WMT or COST's online shopping in the major markets?

May be a good play for LEAPS or stocks.

Bought some 2/19 Calls on BABA, am I crazy?
man tried to get in on some tsm 0dte calls and it didn't fill before that shit took off, fuck me for not getting in on the ask price i guess
when yates is pumping fcel so hard on twitter you just know you gotta be careful
The way it’s been trending I do think so. However, I bought 4/16 because I think with Joe Budden coming into office will moon the ETF even higher. That green deal is juicy
GME pls say sike
Bought BABA “dip” 🤡📉
And MMs fucking with stuff with no resistance lol
Umm added some march 250C.
Bro sports gambling is not happening before 2022. This market is so regulated it has nothing to do with streaming anymore. Insiders know fubo is very low on cash, look at their balance sheet. This may lead to secondary offering. Of fucking course insiders will sell after a 400+% runup
 Note:

There has been word that a member of the politburo has directly voiced concerns regarding BABA, for anyone with a semblance of understanding in Chinese politics, this is big.
I'm thinking of writing up a new post, a 1 Year, 100% ROI Challenge sort of thing. I'm pretty confident I could achieve it with a small account, and teach people a lot about options/trading in the process. What do yall think?

there's been some huge buying. surprised me how big.  starting to see more selling now. i will be taking some off today and swinging some but its risky. i want to see it under a fib level i have at $67.84 to confirm the downtrend

Going to pick up BABA when it drops below $100
Wouldn’t that be two shares for every 9? Hence the 2/9?
If Jack Ma would have kept his big mouth shut for a few more days, none of this would have happened. No wonder he was denied admission to Harvard 10 times.
A problem.  Very insightful.
GME
[deleted]
If not for this BABA would have been a good entry. Now no one knows
Knew I should've bought the pdd pre market dip!! A caution retard is a stupid retard
Zero patience with this guy
Calls are so stressful
Someone tell Santa to take his rally and blow it out his ass
[deleted]
Yo you work for the government? Could you put in a word with the big man
bft bulls buying coke rn
Got my hand on the trigger. $30,000 YOLO on GME. Is the short squeeze finna happen today? Share price just trading sideways and I dunno what to do. OGs please help.
Baba really going on free fall
[removed]
Pump and dump
I DONT WANT ALOT FOR CHRISTMAS

THERE IS JUST ONE THING I NEED

DONT CARE ABOUT THE PRESENTS

PLTR 30C
They are a piece of shit company
HEY! HERE I EXPECT ONLY NOT CONSTRUCTIVE REPLIES !
FKN is just the ticker..
im drowning with you brother
Op knows that first hand
Market makers hedge when someone buys puts.
I wonder why this is happening right now?
The problem is the people who dont cash in their chips hoping for bigger returns.
Karp is definitely into some Silicon Valley transhumanist shit
For real though why has Merkel been chancellor for what seems like 20 years?  It’s like her and Putin and subtly trying to outlast eachother
Jan calls? You could try rolling forward...
Big money interests need GME under $21 today
Hey Santa, wake the fuck up and give me some damn tendies
$9 mil market cap? Lol, goodbye. This is for sure a ban
See, more than doubled.  But you should probably sell lol cause I’m holding bull put spreads & it never goes in my favor for long haha 

** but aapl does have decent sentiment with it right now, it’s a safe stock in volatile times, and they usually pop a little when they announce Christmas sales (and to benefit from the pop, you have to buy today).
If GOEV could fucking GO already that would be great
Remember when you were a kid and dug a hole some boomer would say you were digging to China?

Apparently Chinese boomers say the same thing and baba is digging to America.
the fuck is a put spread??? i just saw some  🚀🚀🚀 in a thread and went all in

###
welcome to options
all I want for Christmas gme 22.35
Neither did Tesla until this year
Losing faith in PLTR :(
Got in a small stock position earlier this week. Do you know much about it?
Retard
so even if tsla is much higher today it’s gonna stay like this? the price rn is higher than when i placed my call
$ROPE
Then don’t cry when the ponzi party is over
Yo! Just said that below. Absolutely
[removed]
AAPL keeps teasing a break out. Just fly already
my portfolio is more of a means of destruction rather than production tbh
Hope so. Sold some puts at 240 for 12/31 and 1/15 a while ago.  If it stays sub 240 I may end up balls deep in baba
Tendies!!!!
Why is Tesla ripping?
Perfect opportunity to buy some monthlies though, this thing should fly in Q1
Can FCEL please drop like 20% today? K that'd be great.
nice dip on CFII. Loading
holy shit AMD what is your problem
Damn I
 May have to do a call for next month on the off chance Dems win the Georgia run off
Same
Removed? No problem mods, we only read the title anyways
Yes! The shorts are still being greedy and we can squeeze them to Jupiter as punishment
TSLA volume actually looking real good imo, you bagholders might see a decent pump today but don’t expect the 10% days of the past
yeah it's been fucking insane I should probably just sell it but I'm retarded
If u had invested in BABA at any time this year, u would have lost money. What a massive dip... My condolences.
TSLA 💸💸💸
You little shit, I’m in
apex🚀🚀🚀
I knew elon would make Space X public
You call sell the calls for Same date that are above. 

Like if you have AAPL 12/31 $140c you can sell AAPL 12/31 $145c (just made those numbers up). 

It works because the $140 fills the $145 if it goes ITM. so you can do that at the top to kind of harvest from loss when you think it’s peaked during the day
Quick, I'm FOMO'ing with yesterday gains, FSR, GRWG, or IIPR best stonk for  autistic returns???
Sell calls from a different strike to lock in profit
Lmao how are you losing money on AAPL. Buying puts?? Because if so you’re a madman
🚀🙌🏻
It’s out there man
Iron ore is so high that’s why China is buying scrap now to offset supply challenges. China has major infrastructure spending and building going on. They aren’t looking to export many of the finished goods for the first time in a decade. They are using them internally. That leaves the market wide open for others.
Anyone else buying the BABA dip??
GME guy said he’s holding STIC till BARK merger. He also said he wants to 2x-5x his money.
Nio being gay 

salesforce pisses me off 

about to pull out of both and throw it at STIC

“I want $2,000 for every American!”

“Ok, we will call your bluff. We will put something on House floor.”

GOP blocks it and they put their own bill. Dems block it.

Now no one is getting shit.
I don’t have any constructive news about Senseonics, however, Iam currently jacking off.
Let's talk after 1pm
No
Fedex only goes down. Glad I cut losses on my Jan 270 calls honestly even tho that was my safest strike 🪧
Thank you. That makes sense.
281 gang here

13 shares gang
So it was you degens. I just saw an article pop-up about unusual options activity in gme (and sg else i forgot) with jan 22c
Had a neighbor about 20 years ago with a HAM radio and a huge antenna off the back of his house.   I discovered this when, one morning while I was in bed sleeping, I heard through my unshielded PC subwoofer some *loud* country dude talking suddenly.  Startled me out of bed.

Note: 

There has been word that a member of the politburo has directly voiced concerns regarding BABA, this is big.
Looking at BABA puts just to feel something
And what serious fucking science have they done lately?

just keep a close eye on it for a few days lol. hopefully it gains a lot of cushion
BABA is doing some impressive shit. Up 50% YTD to nearly flat. I'm in at 215 if it actually goes to flat
Sold out of baba shares for $500 loss

I was literally thinking of selling yesterday. Fml
fuck baba fuck China
No a few days ago
That would make him the X-Man
When do they vote for 2k?
Let’s hope I make it to Jan as currently going down at a rate of 10% per day.

I see $teel - I upvote. $MT to some far-flung iron asteroid in the Kuiper belt.
It's china. If Xi wants BABA will be nationalized and jack man will come out and say it's a great idea.
Go the the casino and put it all on black you will get way better odds
((()))
this is well documented. they were both HELLA weird in NYC social scene, and kind of fell for each other because few others were as mutually self-centered and deviantly autistic.

I can smell the fear 👃
hey jack ma, go fuck yourself

I think you are right to get out - in 2021 I think cruise stocks should be up relative to index funds in but I bet they'll easily be outpaced by some of the other more meme-y stuff.

This is NOT the way.
How much would clean energy pull back if GOP wins Georgia? Or how much would XOM go up? Place your bets
GOP is the one who scrubbed...
The thesis for gme is that its a hold. Buy some put spreads or soemthing if your scared

Its true tho
Double Down man

You buying this dip?
Yes
700 by next year
ICLN and AAPL are the only two on the list worth a damn. Vigin Galactic is a pipe dream that's going to long term fail like Concord. Intel has done nothing but get humiliated all year, and it's not gonna get better for a while. 

M1 chip alone makes Apple a buy and Intel a sell. 

Marvel doesn't own Marvel, that's Disney. Hell, they've got dividends, which means they have no fucking clue what to do with money and arent growing. 

Microvision... I wouldn't put any money on LiDAR. Buy Tesla instead. No, it hasn't reached peak yet. It'll go up on Jan 4th because production is gonna be announced at 500k+, it'll go up when FSD is released, and it will go full on vertical when FSD is good enough to get past regulators. Tesla makes left hand turns on streets it has never seen before just fine without LiDAR.
shares not options
Well, it is definitely true what people were saying yesterday. Volume is real low.

Smart, it gives you the option to elaborate on what you know while any information you leave out can be played off as a TLDR. Basically any effort looks like above and beyond since those 4 letters are added.

You finally gave my portfolio the killing blow. Thanks CCP
Things will be fine, as long as Papa jack leaves his small ego aside and kiss papa xi's commie ass.

Was never going to be a short term play. Papa Vito said price spike starts in Jan.
Holy hell BABA. And I was debating jumping in at $260.
Santa rally canceled this year?
Oh it was overvalued at like 30... but this company only has a market cap of 1.4bil so it's easily pumped and dumped. I bought at 6... so my logic was fuck it just hold it for couple years
Ok boomer. Let’s fire up the coal burners instead.
It will gap up before earnings with more media coverage on steel and blow through earnings.
Pltr is gonna make me wait until next week to lose more money
Would be nice, it's fucking drilling.

Jesus BABA
Your guess is as good as mine!
Yeah that’s why I don’t buy options with high IV any more. If the IV is high I just buy shares. Also don’t get options that are 2 weeks from expiring on WSB stocks because that is too risky
If you’re throwing away money just give it to me next time
Worst day ever for BABA
VLDR please stop

That’s exactly what i think. Though it might take some time
got in on the BABA sale, if I get burned I will never invest in another chinese company again
so what you're saying is if i had just got the coronavirus i wouldn't have tasted all this shit i'm eating on these 12/24 calls
$35/share in one day? Surely that's an overreaction.
Baba already stated they would operate as normal, and will comply with all regulations. People acting like it's going bankrupt or something. This is mind blowing
I don’t know what to do with my hands
poggers
Intriguing. Looking at some options myself. Joined you for a moderate amount on MT but picked up some X as well for the US specific scenario. Thanks!
BFT BUY NOW THIS SHITS GOING TO $16 NOT STOPPING

Nobody is as dumb as I was today. After PM discussions with a fellow retard, I thought it would be a good idea to bet on the veto-proof defense bill being passed by investing in a couple defense stocks. I figured that they wouldn't tank once mango vetoed since they were veto proof and were being forced through on Mon or Tues. Jan 8 calls on those companies actually, shockingly (but not really now that I think about it) tanked this morning and fucked an otherwise flat day for my "portfolio" (although that word sounds too professional for what I have. 

Thinking about selling and starting over once I finish reading a few books on how to not be a dumbass in the stock market.
Picked up calls at 1.40% down, sold at .70% down a few moments ago. 

I don't know how much more of a spike we're going to get.
GME staying above 20 now?
BABA tanks enough I’ll just buy damn leap calls, the risk/reward is worth the YOLO knowing this thing is damn undervalued in an overvalued stonk market.
Will you guys give it a break on hyping PLTR. Its catching hella resistance at the 29-30 range and will not break out until 
A. They secure substantially more contracts 
B. Prove some worth with vaccine dist.

I’m not saying to sell off. Just don’t expect those Oct style gains again for a little bit. If it can break out I think it goes to around $40 ish.

I'm just referring to those that were really bullish on his DD.
Agree, and thank you for posting. TDAmeritrade updated ThinkOrSwim so that the "NYSE closes in" ticker accurately reflects the early closing time today. We should remind all the autists every time there is an early closing.
Low start up costs for sure and the reason is it takes up small SF - low overhead costs and you can feed a family of $4 for less than $30.  Some people love that. Especially now.
No Brexit pump!
See, that's a different question from the original one. This is a valid point but GME is ultimately two things, a short squeeze play and a fundamental value play. The value play depends on becoming the Amazon of gaming, which people think is possible cause the maker of Amazon of pets is buying in big time and giving GME the good one. The short squeeze just needs the company to trend positively and shorts will be forced out. If the stock will only go higher, shorts would be looking to cut loss not risk more time in hopes that it goes down.

 I got scared when the OP got banned lol so I kept a tight sell order as it was rising this morning
Totally agree. Buying at the top because someone here told me so.
well that's because you have to go back in time to make money on them
Rip baba
I love it when it’s going well which is maybe 1/5 trading days
Yeah this is pretty fucked actually
That shit is great tf is wrong with you
Christopher robin told pooh bear to go fuck piglet
Don’t doubt your vibe GME gang.
He’s still a significant owner through Hangzhou, the face of Baba, and the person most knowledgeable about his former company. 

It’s like another Steve Jobs situation in 1997, when AAPL rehires Jobs. Only difference now is the gov in charge doesn’t let the rehire happen. 

CCP isn’t letting go of his balls. 

Why do you think the stock is crashing 12% as of this moment?
Exactly. Just hilarious how when they do the same thing here FAANG doesn't even fucking budge because everyone already knows nothing will happen.

I can understand playing them. They just signed a 100mm dose contract with the US but I just bought a bunch of shares instead of calls because their stock always goes down on good vaccine news for them. It’s bizarre

Nah but good time to buy? Was fubo
RKT the only stock that seems like it wants to shake everyone the hell off

It's already dropped an unreal amount for how big of a market cap it's got. It's more likely to flatline or bounce up then drop another 10%.plus iv has spiked already I'm sure

Selling covered calls is the best. If it stays at 29 all year I will still triple my money.

Always sell at open to take profits...I booked and re entering
AAPL 1hr and 4hr say we hit $140 by Moonday.
TD Ameritrade question:  I bought GME (share) at 21.32. Limit Order filled at 21.32. However, on my position it says I bought it at $26.04. It’s never hit 26 ?   Thinkorswim swim shows it bought at $21.32 . How the F can you buy shares at prices above current market price or levels its never been ?  I bought &lost 20% instantly. neat party trick huh 
  
Had same thing happen in past with TSLA shares. Anyone else have same experience? Causes ?
What has aapl done to you sir?
Lol it’s been a half hour retard
Yeah their end of day trades email gonna be very interesting today, waiting to see if she bought the dip or not
$2000 stimulus got struck down... bullish? 😬😢
If you have less than $25,000 in your account, you are limited to 4 day trades in any 7 day period. It's a FINRA rule. Your broker (unless you're on robinhood) might reset your current count to 0 if you ask nicely.
I will fight you, all I want is to add to the culture here.

It’s a long play, can’t wait to see the jump when it changes to $BARK
I see you have that Dr. PP dd 👌🔥
yup i'm already 11% up.
So, in other words, 1000% short interest is theoretically possible?

I already understand why that would be extremely unlikely though.

LOLOLOL THIS AGED WELL
I looked at their previous run ups between Christmas and Jan earning and thought the same thing.  Waiting to see how far it dips before the end of the day though.
really low volume
RKT doing what RKT does.. bleh.
SQ what is you doin bby
Fkin love this shit 🤷‍♂️
Read #3 and #4 of the rules. STIC also has under 1bill market cap, and a low float.  


He knows he has some clout here for all the gains posts he put out. This subreddit has 1.7mill ppl, guy was tryna pump n dump 100%. Hope the SEC gets his ass.
I get the guy is going to have a life, but compare him to I dunno someone like Bezo's. Bezo's is my guy. The last time he tweeted was fucking Feb 28. That makes sense because I think before that this pandemic started and is when shit hit the fan. The guy has been leading through this pandemic (unlike the US gov and most other Gov's) and the media bullshit he faces is the same shit Elon does but doesn't complain or bitch about it. If there is one thing you don't want to do  that is piss of the government. Though attacking the media is something Bezo's should consider. Look at Shekrili he was doing the same fucking thing as Valeant accept he was mouthing off so they made an example of him (IMO).

Just my two cents man. I like Musk I do. However this has me cautious. 

The real secret to success is just being a hustler. Look at the trio that founded cloudflare (NET) Two of them were fucking useless, the guy that actually created had some sort of genetic brain disease (I think Early Alzheimer's). Guy's fucking brain atrophied. You don't think they used that against him? Even if they didn't know. Tragic what happened to that guy.
\^
Search back on his previous posts don’t make this guy answer this shit again
😂😂😂😂😂 what?

It is already friggin bust. Look at it! Being tied to the military hasn’t helped it avoid dropping 85% already this year. Being tied to the military isn’t going to stop it from dipping 50% again on brexit.

Don’t buy UK companies pre brexit unless you absolutely despise your money.

Looks like we’re pretty much moving sideways at the moment. The IV crush pretty much cut all the premiums in half from the high at 695. I imagine we’re gonna be range bound until the next catalyst (early January). That’s when they’ll say their delivery numbers for q4
Can anyone tell me what they think about GE? Is it a buy? I was hoping I could get some thoughts on the topic, my mom is wondering if she should sell. Thank you guys
any last-minute hiccups before the Dec. 31 departure deadline could still cause some volatility.

Yeah, based on their past antitrust "investigations" it could mean just about anything, just not anything that's based on the actual "law" on the books, which introduces massive uncertainty.

There’s also the benefit of getting high on your own supply. Buying their food and eating it means more gains for you due to increased company revenue.

So, of last note, if vix rises but spxs only bumps up a little, no big deal, probs a little sell off is coming. However, if both start going vertical together, means shit is about to hit the fan, you should exit your calls. However, if both nose dive, it's a strong indicator that we're entering into a bull market
You know they are folding right ?

I’m kind of thinking the same, scoping out the option chain at the moment
Probably those foreign countries that where getting more stimulus than us
Ugh why did I buy GOEV
The worse thing is that the stock plummets significantly below your break even price (which is lower than your strike price due to the premium you receive), and you start you new position of X x 100 shares down. 

You can always buy it back if things go very against you.
its been floating around 27-29 for the past week. why would you sell at the median thinking its the bottom? 🤡
everything's up. I don't think you picked the only one.

Only idiots left bag holding think being late is good.

I would say ban but you obviously belong here.
It really doesn’t. A lot of ardent loyalists say that Tesla’s engineers work out of passion. That may perhaps be true, but a lot of that changes the second you decide to have a family. I thought that I would never stop pulling those 80h/weeks either, but at some point you definitely have to choose which road you’re going to take. I genuinely love what I do, but I place my family at the top anyways. 

I can’t speak for Tesla in particular of course, but rather the overwork culture in general.
Everytime I want to make a purchase on desktop, I get asked. Never happens on phone though
PS $40 by summer of 2021. More remote work, more training classes online. Changes in certification exams (Solar winds security updates and new training classes) re-examinations coming up, needs new courses. Pluralsight is fairly common and used in tech and non tech industry.

My DD has been hearing people at the dog park the PMP exam changing and needing to sign up at HR a bunch of people for courses at Pluralsight. So I started looking into it...after 5 minute of in depth research, my retard brain said buy. 

So I bought calls on PS and also holding onto GME  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀  and PLTR  🚀  🚀  🚀  🚀
call debit spreads for baba maybe?
They are buying puts to scare people off it’s gonna happen my guy

Unban u/SIR_JACK_A_LOT ya wankers.
Yeah bought some shares at 226 just a small amount. don't have a previous position in BABA. Betting its gonna be a slap on the wrist and BABA recovers by 30-40% next couple of months
Just checked and I sold 50 shares of that in June.  Had got got $1.   I need to stop pulling out too early
Only cocaine Mitch

TSLA just broke 650 here we go
So smart to buy after a huge cap drops that far in a day
So is this what the stock market looks like without mass manipulation?
Congratulations. Fuck you
TSLA back to its week high ladies. 670 by the 31st
Nah u blessed it

Eat your trillion dollar gains and send me 2m for my obviously insider trading advice.

Is baba Fucked or is this a good time to load up.
predictable as daylight
Gotta squoze the squeezes if you want to get ahead
Actually bought both this morning during the sale.
Anyone buying the baba dip?
So this is more or less an acquisition play?

Ryan Cohen triggered the rally recently. And his company was acquired pet.com. Aside from that, his only major investment was going long on $AAPL (a recent investment, not like the fuckin 90s).

I don't know why Burry is going long on it though? But that guy claims he is short on TSLA so I don't know what to believe.
Glad I bought that dip
Idk bro hydrogen is projected to be an 11 trillion dollar market by 2030 and $PLUG is still sitting at less than 15 bill valuation while PLTR sitting at 50 bill in a 110 billion dollar market? Doesn’t make sense logistically to me lmao
I’m more concerned about the digital Ps5 taking a huge chunk out of their bottom line
God speed
Blink at 50? like fucking seriously?!
Boomers finally woke up, PLTR and GME moving

JFROG finally breakout
is there any way to back up these claims you are making? Not doubting, just saying that links pointing to where one can double-check that you are not just making stuff up would be nice.

Also, honest question: assuming all this is true and you believe in it, why do you care so much about sharing this info here? If what you are saying is true, it doesn't seem like you'd need to create hype around the stock here for the price to go up.
In with 140 shares
CHWYYYYY YOU BASTARDS I TOLD YOU 115C 12/31
They already did. Today just 1 million shorts need to cover. We are at about 1 million volume. Rest of the day flat or red.
It's not like Luckin disappeared forever. They are available to be traded today if you wanted to invest in them. It's just the fact that for several months no one has any idea what happened to the company once it got delisted. While the chances of that happening with BABA are low, you just never know 100% with China. Baba is China's biggest and most valuable company and they are treating it like Kohls. I would not put limitation on what the Chinese government is or isn't willing to do. Fact is these oversea regimes can be brutal and unfair in the way they apply law.
Me and you both brother.
Record package volumes..still UPS FDX flat

Your comparison makes zero sense.
If you are buying a chunk of Amazon and comparing it to gum then that third of a stick of gum is like the size of Texas.

FCEL calls I bought this morning gonna pay for Christmas by eod
Sooo.. MT calls = win bigly?
No.  Of course it's not illegal.  The long buyer has no idea they've bought a borrowed share.  You can't restrict them from re lending it.  Such a thing would create two markets for shares.  And "non loanable" shares would trade at a discount to the loanable ones.

So, of course it wouldn't work that way.
wdym?
picked up some 29C 0DTE near open...boy was I early. Thought my limit 0.23 was a good entry
Fair also seems like SPIC and GME could pop at the same time. But we'll see.
[deleted]
Any ARK will do well for you if you want consistent gains. Cathie is a  genius. Id probably check out ARKG while there's a small dip and ride it out.
Luckily I didn't buy BABA and Tencent - while their shares are falling over China's antitrust concerns, my Pinduoduo (Ticker: PDD) is going up xD
Yesterday may have been the buy but honestly this is only the beginning. They are breaking ground this spring so I fully expect this to go through $2-3 and probably apply to be listed. They already are considering listing their ipo before breaking ground

Well I’m at 1600 rn. Guess I’ll just hold
That NET dip yesterday was easy money.

RCEY is like 1/3rd of my portfolio right now. But it’s a long term hold imo.

I’ll save you a lot of time. Go to casino and put it all on black... or maybe red, no black... wait, was it black last or red?
you understand that you are +ive money. did the same thing on tsla yesterday made $1500, by waiting 1 more cycle I would have made 3600. its the way she goes.

Probably the broker will give him millions for an evening to exercise. Then he will get a very big margin call but he has stocks worth multiple of that.

what is Cathie Wood doing with her BABA?
That’s good brother. I scalped the shit out of some prem in those first 10 min on puts
All these contracts and pltr doesn’t do shit. What am I missing?
Sell these and roll them out to some ITM or barely OTM 2023 calls. Buy 3-10 of them (depending on the strike price) instead of 50 of these. Palantir will grow over time, it’s not a pump and dump play. If you roll out to 2023, you’ll also have the option to collect premium, or exercise the shares
Cool thanks

Personally think its overvalues now, had a good run up basically on Biden hype. If Dems don't take senate I'm not sure how much clean energy related spending he'll be able to get through the senate, chances are republicans gonna block it
Yeah that’s scary but tbh not a bad trading strategy. Short everything at open and sell like 30 sec later. This market is so fucked

Thats true but I feel like people aren't investing gamesop long term. Its a meme stock to fight the bears. Even the slightest indirect news story is used to try and pump gamestop.

Saying the N word is a fate worse than death.
You dont need the money tho. The broker will lend you the money for 1h and give you a margin call of 1m because he knows that youre gonna pay back. No problem. Or he will force sell it after close to an other MM which will exercise it. No way its gonna be worthless.

Yup. I used to pay for directvnow when it was $35. I've known about fubo tv for quite sometime now as I'm a cordcutting expert. Basically got everyone I know set up with the OTT stuff after I took the plunge about 5 years ago. Best investment I ever made. $2k a year in cost down to like $800 now per household. More $$ for stocks.

Well they dont need to blindly follow just because hes been right/lucky for a while.

He isnt some kind of wsb prophet, just gives him a licence to pump and dump..

Anyone looking at $VIAC ? I’m bullish on the investor day in early 21 it could be the same kind of event driven strategy as Disney Investor day except VIAC has a $20 B valuation. Paramount plus has a bigger streaming business than HBO max by more than double and Pluto TV HAS DOUBLED their revenue sequentially. Worth a look. I’m LONG AF and looking to size up given the growth prospects and I love streaming. Made a fortune on Disney Investor day hoping to double up with this VIAC investor day. This is still not well known as they only mentioned it at the UBS event two weeks ago.
I mean it’s just flat AF since that 10% jump last Tuesday.
That was funny indeed, thanks
Net ready to pop off
Yes! That’s another one I was looking into
Well at least NWARF is showing up in my account again. Although the valuation is still all fucked up
Once again I should have played AAPL but didn't
BLNK 🥴🚀🚀🚀
That is true. But i figured we should go easy because Christmas.

GOEV has a little funny business going on with the price lol, some interesting bid/ask action but that’s what you get on a low volume day. Bought in literally half a second before the dip, thanks rh.
Pltr dead
Was going to buy shares of BLNK ~a month ago when it was ~$8 a share, but held off. Sick to my stomach seeing it up to $48 this morning, fml need some rope

Ok, as usual, awarding the daily thread means my positions end green EOD, esskeeeetitttt bois!!!
It just crushed the other day I think
Can anyone here actually explain the mechanism for how quantitative easing makes it into the markets? 

All the FED is doing is buying treasuries from banks and shoring up their reserves. Their balance sheet goes up, but no money was created, it’s just a 1 for 1 swap. To create money the banks actually have to want to lend out, and even though their reserves are healthy due to QE credit is contracting and they don’t want to lend. 

Can anyone explain how Japan has done this to a greater extent and still failed to create inflation, yet somehow we expect it? 

Paging anyone with more than 3 braincells.
1/8
Still not what I meant to do. Even less so with all of it on margin.
After one financial report
Damn it feels good to sell at the fucking top
ur a fucking dumbass. look at apple this morning. i hope you sold
Right. Had to include it there lol
I just split baba for loss and bought Tesla, this is my worst loss of the year I should’ve just called it a year and enjoy the holidays smh
Should be fine with the conference and demo day coming

Why is this tanking today?
Buying this PLTR dip, I am in until $40
Bad idea. Insider share lockup expires next week. More dumping ahead
Just a panic sell off before it goes up.
I cannot believe I quit AAPL and it only lasted one day before I am back.

Expiration date
If you're even thinking about touching Baba, it better be in SHARES only. While I LOVE the company, this antitrust probe has me a little concerned. I'd buy a little on every dip, and then be patient. It could be a little while until this rebounds.
Honestly just swallowing something warm is enough for me after losing all my money...

Not very forward looking. Considering the moves they're making to implement sports gambling into the platform. I pay for Fubo/Spectrum and it costs less than  any Comcast or cable package out there with sports, at least to what's available to me.
Imma be honest this sounds hella gays
Now there are vaccines (and they work even with the "new" coronavirus)
Hahaha. Exercise early please.
I hope so - I'm up 400%+ on luckin. Let BABA bottom out, then buy as close to the bottom as you can.

Today half day and tomorrow closed yes?
I lost 20k on BABA, I’m not gonna lie I thought it would be more.
Little manipulation on a low volume day haha not concerning imo
Can't sell low if you don't sell

Well it was a SPAC, which debuts around 10.50 due to the amount of cash they are holding. I think it could hit 20 dollars easy if people catch on
But let’s be real you could have shorted any stock at open and have a 95% chance of making money
Buying dips until I’m broke yes sir! 

*coughs*

It's ok BABA, you go when the CCP lets you.

Baba calls
*A new challenger approaches*
Rofl China going after AAPL next
How much is something like that worth x it's original value if it comes true?
Yep horse race ticker spam guys
You’re a retard dude January is super bullish
aapl 130 c’s printing
The main thing WSB has taught me is that when people overexaggerate a stock thats mooning (when it only climbed up 1%), or is a MUST BUY DIP, or anything like that, they are 99% a bagholder who bought at ATH and wants to break even and cash out. The other 1% is someone who has some weekly calls and are worried.
Just to make sure I’m reading this correctly: I should FOMO in by maxing my margin??
1k shares. Never surrender
Last chance grab icln under 28 Shit should get more calls? $33
Who here had BABA calls
When will MT volume spike?
my baba shares are doing just fine
semiconDONKters
People are not going to be happy with SIR\_JACK\_A\_LOT.
Even on open selloff my ICLN leaps only lose 2% 😎

every green day gives me 10-20%
Learned that the hard way, but thankfully only looking at -$70.  Gl, that sounds reasonable
[removed]
I just realized😂
Brave man
The board at my hedgefund are all boomers 

The 'Three Day Rule' tells investors and stock traders to wait a full three days before buying a stock that has been slammed due to negative news.

So they always have a wait and see cash is king approached on a bluechip that gets hammerd

Fuck you BABA fuck you PLTR fuck you TSLA. Fuck you Jack Ma and Xi Dada too. Merry christmas everybody.

Love the way he says Tessssla
Got out of my 50 369 SPY calls for 600$ loss. Lesson learned. Always check the time when you buy for a scalp. (Bought right when market closed) and didn't want to ride them out so I sold at open.
Ill be bagholding this STIC for a while
Idk why IPOF is moving but I bought 55 shares yesterday so this works out lol
Probably but I think it's the $65 as a whole that could be concerning. For example alot of people have cut pay tv out and stream sports through other platforms- legal or illegal. I think part of the concern could be that a consumer recession continuing forces people to cancel. Of course this is my guess as to why the PT is at $8

I would like to imagine that new shorters entering GME pushed the price down and old shorters exhaled a sigh of relief, only to continue living the nightmare of being insanely underwater because they tried to short GME during a new console cycle
Yea he will, but he's gonna lose out on the biggest bull market in history in 2021

Here we go FCEL 🚀
Sir jacka lot got banned for promoting PUMP n DUMPS (STIC)
WE DONT HAVE MODS
I had $36, fuck it. lol
Wait for the pull back. ARK even said they only expect to target 20% growth per year going forward. We are seeing 20% in a week. Way too fast.
My guy is the reason I’m dumping 30k into a random SPAC with a dodgy MILF CEO. 

Ofc he is banned from making me buy at such a high price. 

Mods think by removing the text contents, it will no longer be pump and dump, but jokes on them as wsb autists only read the title anyways.
I hate when stocks go up close to 1% at open and then play with my emotions and bleed the rest of the day.... nothing is more homo
Hope you bought the XL dip
\+2% -> -4% my paperhands are shaking!
Intentional or not his post legit turned into a pump n dump lol
To just under $30 and back down to 27-28 again.
Well the apology part might be a stretch.
Da fuk pltr?
Why is it going down?
Yeah
Oh I’m going to buy some, but the price rocketed after that DD.. I’ll wait
Roger that man, and good luck to you!

I’m gonna need PLTR to hit 30 before I see my FIL tonight
Ccp is doing it not Jack ma
Pltr - kindly fuck off you piece of shit
Tim 🍏
i don’t think ittl go past 132.50 although i hope i’m wrong
This market is going to tank in January. Market is already flat the last 20 days.
Canoo dipped why though?
They have the cheapest price per month in regards to a full sports package versus the competition.
The ark hype got me but I’m out now, everything in those etfs are at crazy all time highs, I was too late and missed the boat, if it has a dip eventually I may get back in.

Where the fuck is Santa
Volume is abysmally low. Pretty obvious that it's being pushed down by bigger players
While we all want Pltr to take the fuck off already. People in here crying bc it has traded sideways is just dumb. We all knew it was a long play. We got a gift when it went from 15-30 in a week. This support is actually bullish af just chill, it will happen.
Ya rly
This
Invested in BABA when they first IPO back in 2016. It's an awesome company, but it's tough to invest in companies that are run by a communist government. Sure you have the assurance of the Chinese government in some cases, but that's also the thing that makes investing in these companies scary at times. Luckin Coffee is a very recent example, and now Baba. This is a ploy by Xi to get even with Jack Ma for him trying to have ANT go public without Ma's consent.
You'll be fine
Come on apple I gotta buy some groceries today.
BABA only made my portfolio -15%. I'm still alive. Bought a BABA leap and a Jun cause what else can I do

If it happens it won't be until a few hours before close. On a normal day that would be maybe 1 or 2pm, today it could be 10 or 11am.

People who do charting or technical analysis are retarded. They will see in the charts what they want to see. If you want to make actual tendies, you need to raise actual chickens.

Oh GME? Are you ab to do something?

Don't feel bad about taking and spending gains. Don't be the retard that looses it all, especially after the run you've had.

Look at mister money bags over here with a position that costs 100% more. 

In all honesty I wasn’t thinking about it and I just chose the highest available strike, it’s too early for me to be thinking critically apparently.
Why are they keeping Sue Bae under $92 😢

Here’s the thing about SAVE versus the traditional guys.  They only fly one aircraft.  A320 family aircraft.  They focus on one type of traveler, low cost vacation travel.  They don’t mess much in international except into Latin America and the Caribbean.  They are primed for people that want to get back out.  Delta and American need business travelers, they need international travel, those things aren’t coming back as fast as the demand for grandma to see her grandkid and will fly between Tampa and Toledo.  The low cost single aisle vacation airline will come back a lot faster than the full service multi-fleet guys.
No, GME has a declining business model that will keep declining because they have no edge and Keep closing stores.

Because the one time you buy the dip it will continue to dip
Yup. Knew it was coming. Jack Ma gettin sent to the camps for disrespecting Winnie the Poo.
I'm in for GME, my new friends. Only 24 shares cause robinhood is taking forever to process my latest deposit.
I haven't seen the full report but I'm sure it emphasizes the competition they have generally with OTT and the cost of their packages

All aboard the NBA train
Yeah?  You think G O E V W is a buy or just G O E V?
I almost bought BABA at the beginning of this month. So glad I didn't, it's at -60 USD or approximately -20% compared to then. But yeah this company has had a run of bad news and still looks to have a bright future, probably going to wait until the dip finds its bottom and then buy in.

I clearly outlined this in a previous post. Because Rocket Finna Fuck

Don’t follow the sheep man. If people hate this stock (which still has meme potential) that’s a good sign to buy, no matter how hard it is to pull the trigger. But this play requires patience- it is at least a year long hold
Man and I thought BABA was a deal and a half below 250 Good thing  I didn't buy... Praying for bagholders
You wanna make money? Buy puts on PLTR at open and then sell and buy calls at 10:20 am
why is it smashing into the earth then?
That’s what I was thinking of doing they’re so cheap now

PLTR doing the thing again
Picked up some baba leaps on the downlow 🤒
more tendies than most of these autismos, this one included
VIX is a ETF dedicated to market volatility, when it goes up, generally means theres a lot going on with the market, generally sell offs. SPXS is where bears go to buy calls if overall amount of puts are on the rise. If there is a sell off, generally VIX should go up. SPXS is generally a good indicator for bulls to watch if the market is about to fall on its face. Keep these two plus spy on a watch list and it can be a early indicator if shit is going to hit the fan. Dont know what to make of it with alot of sell off buy these 2 being down

I'm buying here, but not going all in or anything. If it goes below 200 I'll grab more shares but then I'll wait and see what happens. What's the worst that can happen from here?
Next week 50 strike had huge volume yesterday so I bought. Regretting it now.

I thought I’d talk to you idiots like you talk to each other. Retard. I will just post memes from now on. Easier for this group of retards to understand.
Imagine panic selling ICLN 😂
just sell so that it can rocket soon
It's a genius solution, even if it's just temporary until they get their own in place
Is GME squeezing today, Monday, or never?
Should sold ICLN at open 🤡
as soon as aapl hits 132 everyone just sells. WEAK
I feel like ark funds always nose dive at open then recover. Let's just hope for a 2-4% recovery

Bold of you go assume we’ve seen the bottom.

You fucking kidding me I accidentally sold 1/20 368p 12/24 yesterday when trying to cancel an order for all them (was a second late one still went through) and that was my 3rd day trade and couldn’t sell EOD for 50% gains. Now I’m down 50% fuck my ducking life
up 14% at open...looking good
SQ 237.5 12/24 let's do this shit

I’m in the industry and pre-Covid Delta would be the only American carrier I’d hold.  They were diverse in fleet and revenue with their MRO work, specifically their engine shops.  However they depend on business travelers, which is going to be the slowest segment to return.  Spirit on the other hand depend on cost sensitive vacation travelers, and we can see there is a massive backed up demand for people to start going places, grandparents to see grandkids, people to get to the beach etc.  Spirit focuses on these travelers.  They’re not the best airline, but they’re ramping up now to move a ton of people.
Pltr mooning
GME GME GME
Ur fucking retarded.
Okay having thought about this BABA situation a bit more here is where I’ve landed:

I think it’s gonna be a slap on the wrist.

BABA is such a poster child for Chinese tech. 

The reason I don’t think they will fuck over BABA  too badly is that it’s going to have very negative consequences for other chineese companies to be able to raise funding from abroad.

If investors are going to always be worried that the Chineese government can fuck over a tech company they are going to be much less willing to buy shares in chineese companies. It will negatively impact valuations. 

So think XI will use this more as a warning shot and not full on fuck them over.

However there is still a small chance obviously that Xi doesn’t care about any of that and he just has a personal vendetta.

I’m gonna buy some shares at open and then monitor next few weeks and see which way this is going then buy more if looking like a slap on wrist. 

I think there’s a 30-40 percent upside here if it’s just a slap on the wrist and I’m not investing any money I can’t afford to lose. 

I definitely would not YOLO and go all in!

Whereas I think once next earnings come around and people remember how much fucking money this company makes and it rebounds. Add to that the ANT IPO coming back to the table. Alot more upside then downside in my eyes.
How high will GME jump?
I was long BABA earlier this week and got out because the price action was the definition of complete poo poo, kicking myself I didn’t buy puts. Any other large cap stock I’d go heavy Into this dip, but not here.
I’m gonna forget I even commented, so your “I’m gonna win and show him” mentality is null and void. Jesus likes to glitter!

I am thinking it will fall little more from here before the end of the year. But it will roar back by early Feb when earnings are due.

CEO was on CNBC twice yesterday confirming merger with BarkBox
Correct, eventually, once the merger finalizes, the ticker will convert to the acquired company.

Some SPACs have a contracted target before they even start the SEC registration process. Others can take up to 2 years.

The good news is with these programs, if you get in early, you have a floor for your investment as it's a cash secured investment until a merger is voted on.

People refer to getting in near or at NAV (Net Asset Value). The SPAC doesn't really have any substantial operating expenses early in it's life cycle outside of due diligence and attorney fees, so it's NAV is basically what all investors have put in so far.

Dude i’m driving
That would be 1/5000th then wouldn’t it! Lol and that doesn’t even include that only a certain percent of that is net profit. It’s easy to see that PLTR will be a dud because these contracts even for hundreds of million will not grow and will even diminish over time as competitors start to come along. There is no exponential growth potential. Thus I’m only semi hard about PLTR.
I never let options expire worthless. Just me
Haha okay Timone

To the 0.3 people in this subreddit smart enough to understand this, here's my outlook 5 minutes before the market opens for today:

The heat map of the global power struggle between authoritarians and libertarians is acting a lot like the heat map of climatic temperature offsets. Hot and cool zones moving around the earth sporadically and unpredictably. Right now the west is relatively cool but the east is fluctuating wildly around varying but all above-normal levels of heat like it has been for over a year now and a lot of things that have been bending the whole time are at their breaking point. Since they're on the faux-communism control scheme in most of that hemisphere, the power struggle being in a heat wave in that hemisphere overall means faux-communism is lashing out at capitalism globally right now while the faux-capitalists in the west can afford to take the hit without too much liberty bubbling up in their spheres. Putin will continue ordering Xi to attack capitalists and consolidate the CCCP's power as long as he's dealing with Navalny, and as long as the US is paralyzed by this game of chicken we keep playing with our impending civil war, he doesn't really need to give our injuries much focus. The UK with their border/supply chain crisis is honestly worth more of Putin's attention than the US right now. So the USD is going to keep sliding to make the market look good relative to it, our market will basically keep looking like a circus with random shit happening and news going haywire all the time to keep the cycle of chaos in a stable balanced back-and-forth loop between the bulls and the bears, and most of the interesting action where real shit is happening based on real factors is going to be from the east. So if you like doing actual analysis-based trading for big gains and you're not just here for the casino of gambling on random ups and downs of the circus, pay attention to what's happening with BABA and try playing your money in a country with anything going on other than America's chaos-on-autopilot situation. Trust me, there are enough foreign companies on Robinhood these days, you don't have to sled downhill with USD all winter or hope to get lucky with something like GME by pure random chance.

TDA cash account is worth looking at
I love getting together with all my bros and getting a massage train going. I love my homies.
So what? Business can be hard, sometimes hurricanes happen, earthquakes, etc. The government getting involved doesn’t help it hurts, they print money, it causes inflation on assets, which pushes poor people further away from things like home ownership in the future. The government doesn’t need to step in and rescue anyone, especially not a business. I run a business, if for some reason what I did stopped being profitable, I would do something else, almost immediately. People are supposed to adapt, not wait for the big government to come fix their problems.

How can I reduce the loss of my shitty baba calls? Is there any possibility? (I am extremely retarted pls be sorry)
I win if you win, brother
Look up their business model. The house market is big, they don’t need to dominate Zillow for now. Also, based on their valuation and for people who take into account analysts opinion, the company’s low is $30 mean $85 and High $110. Zillow is about $120 and Redfin is about $80. Being conservative, I think the stock is undervalued and should be $45-50 before end of year. It has a huge potential. Also, the company just went public and hasn’t gotten a lot of coverage yet.
What time frame you look at op
They never email me back anyways
You comparing share price?
What kind of company are they?
Shitron put a PT of $60 on XL, thoughts?
The focus of the BABA investigation is actual monopolistic behavior (requiring merchants not to sell through other platforms). If China just imposes a measured punishment of a large fine, like the West would do, I think this would recover pretty quickly and signals that capital investment is safe in China.
Chicoms cannot be fucked with, rip BABA

Well you'd be wrong. We are fueled by degeneracy. This does not mean that DD has the be wrong, it means that the action taken on the basis is wrong and usually over the top (YOLO).

As far as the comparison is concerned: comparing the revenue on a single day in 2020 with the years revenue of a company in a totally different sector, country and decade is entirely retarded. Here is a similar statement to what you've said: standard oil earned 20 mil in 1871 while Hyundai heavy industry built a single ship for 140 mil in 2020. 

But which company is a better investment? It says nothing!

Comparing macroeconomic situations to show that the wider market is entirely different is not.

Of course. This is what leads me to believe we’ll have a tsla style squeeze. Lots of people will start to fomo, lots of people will think “this is the top, I better short it.”
I am actually quite pleased to see BABA burn

Hope y’all never invest in Chinese trash again

How? That bill is still sitting at his desk, he didn’t veto it
Its being bought up in premarket so far but 675 doesn’t seem realistic for today

People really seem to forget that a business can survive independently of shareholder value being destroyed. 

We’re delisting CCP controlled companies CCP could destroy the pink sheets for Alibaba as a petty way to get back at Americans.

I truly think they should make a movie about GME and the short squeeze. I think it would be fascinating. They could call it the Big Long ^green ^dildo

I was so close to going big on BABA leaps about a month ago. So glad I can lose that money in an otherwise heartbreaking fashion.
Genuinely curious about this too.
There’s no more consoles to sell so... does that still matter?
I assume none. Because doing anything more than basic buying options has the risk of losing more money than you have
XL sell off at open
government shutdown. SPY 320 here we come!
I’ve done a brief amount of research and nothing stands out to me at all. They’re trying to go digital, which just seems like a final death twitch before getting Blockbustered.
1. Anyone who actually thought 2k would be approved is a fucking tard and clueless about the legislative process

2. Baba is being investigated by the CCP not the SEC. get your head out of your ass and realize this is only the beginning
That’s it NIO 💃🏻
Lol
CLDR calls
Thats the spirit, we make big bucks so we have to give some to those who are less fortunate. Donate some % of your winnings if you can, fuck those greedy ass boomers, we're the future and we'll take care of our own.
Haha. .01 for Jan 2022 calls? Dear God let’s hope not.

Not personal, I don’t care if you are against me on a play as long as you have the balls to back it up. This board of full of worthless talk. If you’re gunna take the time to put a price and date on something, you should back it up with money. Simple.

Good luck on your bets!  <3
If you do spreads, you need margin.
Congress should give a specific stimulus to us BABA share holders
yessir
Baba puts at open orrrr????
They know you were going to YOLO and lose it anyway so they just skipped a step for you
I was promised a short squeeze today
PLTR and a morning dump name a better duo
In for another 500 shares 🚀🚀🚀
May be 238 or so ...but I am closing out at open or around 9.35....I just need 30-40%, so that I can take 4k profit before Xmas. ..and will reenter based on the scenario.
Twitter is balls deep in it. There are calendars with what phase each one is in and when the merger vote is.
So let me guess, you bought above $18 last time, probably sold under $16. And are now back again to buy the high and dump shares 2 days from now for another large loss? Legend
I appreciate the DD. I remember reading an article about this company a while back and thinking it was a great idea. I didn’t know they were public. Still very early, but a great concept. Just dipped a toe in.
I mean it’s going to be .01 so you might as hold
I never got to play it but always wanted too, I’d invest in a company that re did it for 2022
All in GME shares. Easiest answer of my life

Hell yeah brother, I'm with you. We are a group of traders and no matter how retarded our plays are, we are making big money. I'm up 400% for the year so far, I'm close to my target of a down-payment on a house. You can't deny the abilities that we have. 

Congrats on the wins, and congrats on turning your life around. Don't lose it, keep playing smart and you'll make it to a mil soon. Just remember, never fomo, don't rush the trades, even if you're fucking 50 years old you still have plenty of time before you eat shit and die. Take your time and turn your 8k into a milly by playing smart and being nimble.

Or Palantir can say they are working with Oracle, or some other large software company and the stock would move$20B in market cap

great GME dd this morning from a guy who noticed that BABA is the 2nd largest long holding of Melvin Capital, the single biggest GME short.  BABA tanking could put a lot of margin pressure on them, depending on their financing setup.

Thought this was a pretty interesting/compelling point.
It’s only up 134% this week.
Do I sell my april 2021 300c ?
It is unrelated to todays news of the investigation into BABA's monopolistic practices.

It’s ok bud, I herd your wife is going out of town and her boyfriend will raise your allowance while she’s gone if you give him suckies for tendies.

Edit: I’ve never been one for Meme’s like this until it I joined WSB to watch people win and lose lots of money, my friend I hope one day you will be there to joke at me and make me feel better one day 🥺
XL is making me rich but I might roll some into Pershing in case there’s a Christmas miracle?

Probably why you’ve never posted gains. You don’t put your money behind what you believe or how you feel. Huge coward.

I think by the time we see a dip it’ll have hit 38-40 already
Fuck I guess I should as well. Own some in an IRA.
Dude, we're going green. I'm just trying to work out if I sell as soon as I see green. I'm never doing this with weeklies again

Simply looking at the IV really. Anything above 100% is too high in my opinion, but I will sell options in that case. Google the Greeks to understand options before you start buying. Also learn about intrinsic value and time value. Investopedia has all this information

Jumped in XL yesterday at 25. Got stopped out at 24. An hour later the Citron tweet oof
Almost like someone’s selling
Was there any prior indication XL was going to moon like this?
DAME BABA$ u DO WESTERNERS LIKE THIS ON CHRISTMAS EVE !!!!

U SAVAGE BRUH !!!
If the option loss realizes (or expirations) are after you made pltr purchases by exercising, there’s no problem. 

If before, it’s a grey area. Some cpas would say wash sale some would not. Your broker won’t report a wash sale typically though on that.

I also need to know the answer to this.
Imagine when Apple first launched, and went up 18% so someone said fuck it. Imagine when PLTR was $9 and someone said Fuck it. Imagine when NIO was $8 and someone said fuck it.

Unemployment is high because of government restrictions preventing people from working, shopping, etc. The government needs to spend (and do) less, not more.
Yes, but you're here, right? I'd say wait for a dip if you're gonna hold long term. But there will probably be a rush to buy this morning (I assume you also saw the SIR_JACK_A_LOT DD).

Gonna rip at open I can feel it. They’re gonna try to shake us out in the first 10 minutes
What are we predicting GME to hit?
See what happens first , I bet massive amount of people will sell the stock because of the FUD , so you can buy the bottom for today or wait to see if it will go lower next week.

And now they will be free to fall out of relevance without the EU.
The worst part is seeing the % gain of the option you sold.  Just knowing there’s some retard on the other side eating a whole box of crayons in celebration of his 3600% return on a call he bought.

Did the same thing with XL covered calls.  Even went as far OTM as they had and it still blew through it.  Even when we’re right, we’re still retards.

Anywhere between here and $5.70 is a fair deal to me.
My Amzn put credit spread shows a larger loss than my collateral on Robinhood. Is there some possibility that my max losses could exceed my collateral? I thought losses were capped at the difference in strike minus the credit received.

The guy gave a specific price he said it would be at you fuck. You don’t have to buy puts on things you don’t like but if you’re telling people that the price will be lower, by a certain date , you should put your money where your mouth is. People flapping their lips for no reason when they won’t even put their money to back it up are pussys.

After looking into their website, seems like it’s easy to sell a haunted house, sight unseen.
There's a weird 28.8 resistance on PLTR that's so freaking horizontally straight.
Ready for takeoff 🚀🚀🚀
Short burn hasn't started yet at all. They are still shorting by buying put options. They haven't learned yet. But stocks and keep strong. They will burn tomorrow!!

What 🐝 gonna do
Pltr gonna get manipulated as fuk today. Hold through the losses
Darn shimmy till Monday
Everyone's got fomo, if you're lucky, there might be a dip, btfd
Real shit is there gonna be a GME dip I can wait for or do I need to get in ASAP
It only matters the % not the $
Doesn’t seem like it’s going to happen but it’s a great management so next target might be even better

Nice. But in all seriousness, they have set themselves up for success. It’s a mission driven company with very smart people. Wall Street is giving them the shaft because they didn’t IPO, but eventually, and I suspect soon, they will have no other choice but to hop in or be stuck with buying shares at a high value.
All I know is that it's 100% tendies.

OK Greatest Generation
it dipped this morning but it got gobbled up.
I’m not sure you quite understand what it is you’re saying.

Even if they “opened up” everything, which for the most part already are save a couple states, unemployment is high right now and some of those jobs just aren’t there anymore.

Congress dragged their feet too long and the effects of it are not proportionate.  

So if you think it’s wasteful, when you get your $600 you should probably send yours back.

Myself?!😂😂😅😂
Wait for the drop of the first 30 minutes and buy 0 date calls

Averaging down personally
Now Nio dying because baba fuck China
Amen
they make an electric/hybrid power sources basically. you can just integrate it into established production lines. rather than produce whole vehicles themselves. makes alot of sense seeing as even TSLA has trouble meeting production quotas even thugh they have plenty of money and facilities.
Is PLTR really staying below 29 until next year?
69
Haven't heard that in 12 seconds
Read the comments on the post of u/deepfuckingvalue. The increase in the last days wasn't due to shorters covering their positions, but due to market sentiment. Shorters have now bought put options, as they couldn't short anymore. Meaning that this shit will go to the moon. 

Not only this, but we are at war with them. It is of most importance to stay strong now and buy the shares so their short positions will be hurt such that they have to cover their positions. 

Dont give up. Retards strong together 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Edit: to answer your question how many shares you should buy: buy an amount which doesn't scare you when the shorters manipulate the prices like they did after the quarterly announcement. Holding the shares is more important than buying and getting scared and selling again.
They really should have changed their business model about 5 years ago to be a huge online platform with brick and mortar stores similar to best buy. They could be for tech and gaming what best buy is for general consumer electronics.

GME will not make it very long I predict, but good on the rest of these autists for making sweet BBQ flavored tendies.
They also said seminal. Hehe.
150$
Someone give me a good call to spend $100 on pls
Lmao. Video games reselling is a niche market. This company is priced like amazon because it is unprofitable and making an attempt to survive. Pumped up stock because of all these YOLO GME plays. Check this post in 3 months and we will see who is right

Dude with all this retardness , it can go anywhere

But I would say if it hits $25ish, sell the principal and let the profit ride 

Or 

Sell half and keep half of it keeps going up

Well, if you're actually genuine, I can tell you physical games aren't totally dead yet. Lots of people, myself included,  refuse to go digital. Not having some dumbass company decide when and how I can use my games.
I don’t think it reaches $20 but a retest of $25 would be nice before breaking convincingly over $30+

Dear SPY,  
if you could hit 370 again today I would make good money. If you would hit 369, I would make a little money. If you would stay above 368 I wouldn't lose too much money.  
If you go below that, I'm going to be very disappointed and personally offended.
🙏🚀
>This company is priced as if it is already the amazon of video games

Amazon is currently over $3k a share and GME is $20. If you are going to make a ridiculous argument you should at least try to make it have 1 foot in reality.

I personally liked his other picks more. This one feels like something I would buy only to sell before the merger. If loot box couldn't make it, not sure bark box can but tendies so yeah
Yikes
I actually have a fuckton of warrants on this. I’m up 3x so far. The food is awesome and they’re already in Costco and Sam’s club. Marketing and PR set to begin next month. Seems like a no brainer to me. 

Plus I lost a bunch of weight by substituting my horrible chicken tender meal lunches from Publix and eating 180 calorie açaí bowls instead. Also saved money as the bowls are $2.15 each when you buy the 6-pack at Costco.
Bro you def should YouTube it. Its a solid story of autism
Real talk what this does is just moves the shorts to someone else.

Basically, those options either have to be exercised (buying the shares) or sold (kicking it down the line). So bugging actually changes, the shorts still have to be covered, just by someone else
bro we have the same thought
ok time to get XL, I can sense this has same autist strength as QS

The alternative of not passing it is to open up and do what we’ve been doing since 1776. It’s been working fine so far.
🐴BIO and you boys can make enough money to fund your hedge bets, on Chinese stocks, from now until 2030.
Serious question. I lucked out and yolo’d into tn xp yesterday and it’s up big in after hours. Sell at open or ride it out?
Market close at 1 today?
I added some, same dumb question
I bought shares after bug jump yesterday and they already plus 20%. Bad i have only 3
They’re literally closing down 1/2 the B&M stores. A major portion of the country would still rather console on disk for resale. Hence why the disk version is harder to get. They have major investors so bullish they’re trying to take over the company. They have a huge deal with Microsoft.

The future is brighter than “B&M is dead”
they could buy it with an apple watch and some kfconsole tendies
I told you guys XL would rip. There’s still time to get in before 60
Whats a position?
Black and white?
Does anyone know the HR manager here. My clock in username won’t work. However, good morning dumbasses.
No
Currently own baba shares, should i uhhhh, buy more?
Today i wanted to buy CP2077 and i wanted to buy from GME to give them an extra boost. They dont sell steam keys (atleast here).

So a start would be: Selling digital keys. Easy enough.

Cause your cock wasn’t XL like mine
You mean you haven’t had sex covered in maple syrup? You ain’t living life bro.
yea it really is too late. This is just gambling that it will slide further negative. But i would do a call play because people will buy the dip to push it up a few dollars. May be counter intuitive looking but ya know.
Please don’t sell off please don’t sell off please don’t sell off

It is not pumped by wsb it's pumped by RC and it's barely at 1.4 bn marketcap. But go on, and not answer the question. Just trying to have a conversation at least in good faith.

Congrats

He's made her plenty of money over the S&P. I just find it funny every time I get the email. Today it was MGNI.
Google helps a lot.

They lay out the bill and it’s spending.

PPP, extra unemployment, State aid, farmers, and wierd pork spending shit.

Yeah some of that shit is wasteful, but consider the alternative of not passing it.
The very first time I read the phrase "sTonKs onLy Go uP" I though the top was surely in.  
If I had just believed it and bought leap calls on almost anything, I'd be a very rich man.  
At least from then until now, the stonks did indeed only go up.
If you're gonna burn money, do it with $HYLN calls
Only 3.5 hours of trading. I feel cheated.
My "please fly again" message must have not gotten through
Is that a real flavor?! Thought limoncello was the bottom of the barrel

Whoever hurt you...

That can’t do that to you anymore.  It’s ok.  You’re grown now, it’s all over.   They can’t hurt you anymore.
I got 6 x 29$ weeklys for .04 a contract. YOLO
Thats what im saying. Got it at 10.50, may hold post merger for that dividend and go full boomer
Hey how do those remind me thingys work?! 
I need one. I need an Adult please?
palantir fuck meeeeee
It would become the best vaccine out there if true.
With such little volume today, this sub could actually control the market   I’m guessing GME and PLTR
Set a limit buy at $20 until cancelled and just wait for it to trigger... Probably won't ever happen, but if something goes horribly wrong at PLTR, you'll be able to find out quickly.
Good sign, but doesn't mean much if they load up tens of thousands of puts during open market hours, like yesterday...
Wow great content keep it coming

Edit: 24.50
Oh my the uneducated S-3 filing 11 million additional shares added yesterday, oh they got 200 million capital from it. 100+ stock in 2021 no debate.
how do i stalk this profile so that i can become rich?
Yes read their latest earnings statement - right direction financially as well as operationally which will support / increase their bottom line. Although they’re well poised to execute their financial improvement initiatives (favorable working capital, removing redundancies in store, SG&A, etc) the question still remains how successful they’ll be in their transition into e-commerce vs giants such as steam and not to mention potential competitors coming into the market (far stretch but perhaps Amazon or other international players)
Sold tsla last week to buy baba calls. 
I'm sorry Papa Elon. I'll never bet against you and America again.
Yes everybody please do!!
The PR team sucks and theres no big firm giving it a price target. Itll trade flat until that happens
What’s the merger they are working on?
[deleted]
well thats what i was doing and in 10k loss. stfu
Which ultimately turned into paypal
Time to short PLTR
Next Stop: Moon
which way will AAPL shoot today. Probably down right?
Why didn't I get XL 30c when they were $450
Thanks but not in there
If GME somehow makes it to $25 today I’ll buy a new boat.
$SBE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀👨‍🚀
XL is pumping like a madman on christmas week with no volume. once ppl get back from holiday this is going past 50 easily.
Sell if you have a “fuck China” mentality which is fair after this fiasco. Hold if you understand that your emotions in the market are temporary.
Absolutely. Both shares and leap calls are looking really good for CRM.
I'm upvoting because it's true lol
Saw this. Of course more vaccines the better but is it going to be too little to late?

Ok good suggestion
How are the shortsellers gonna cover in this market lol. Fuck them.
COVID will continue mutating like any flu strain, it’s just a matter of when pussies will get tired of being pussies about it. Maybe we’re entering a world where a whole segment of society will lock themselves indoors until they die (awesome! Natural selection!)

I agree about selling, fuck agents - useless cunts. However, how is this better than Zillow?
I bought one XL 1/15/21 $25c at $7.00. It ain’t much, but it’s mine.
I reappy dont knlw at this point, I have shares from 280...
When U/DEEPFUCKINGVALUE is out, everyone should be out.
The government acting as a social safety net is a huge hindrance to the economy, throughout most of our countries history you relied on your family, and community for support in hard times. If you believe society has the obligation to help others, they should do it directly, not by using the government to take other people’s money to pay for it.
Someone on here randomly said they don't fuck with Chinese companies. I wish I could thank him - kept me away from BABA
Smiling and laughing with the Family at christmas while crying deep down about my BABA Position.
Imagine thinking a $2t company was limited in what it could do. Please
Last week I sold me TSLA calls Friday afternoon, at close it jumped like $50. Is that gonna happen again? Should I buy some $690-700 lottos at open?
In at .22 got some high profile talent
What about the guy who bought $28M shares at an average cost of 15 in order to be an insider? Is he just yoloing?
I trusted you China! You dishonour my family this Christmas.

Then go to wendys
GME making me nut everyday I love it
boys eriously. get in to XL.

1 thing about SPACs is that there is too many. Citron basically did the DD from all the EV SPACs and said XL is a winner. its going to Valhalla.
buy the BABA dip, that is all
Congrats theta gang. Whatever happens to my current puts, happens. Not buying anything till last 5 mins of day. Then all in on puts for the rug pull next Monday.
This is the way

Probably not that good of a day to trade lol

Alright BABA shareholders - are we selling at open?
Cathie thinks so
No need to buy puts. I will never short a stock because very little to gain on shorting. I think there are alot better stonks then GME. Dont waste your money on this one
Yes, if you plan to hold for longer than 10 days.

Melvin Capital is made up of a bunch of cucks. SAD! GME WILL WIN, AND WE WILL WIN BIG!
Yeah my personal take is that this is the most likely scenario. MA's just gotta suck some dick and get in line. I think Xi will use this more as a warning to other companies to get in line and know whose the boss. 

Nightmare scenario is if Xi does to BABA what Putin has done to oligarchs he didn't like essentially forcing them to give up their businesses
At least

I’m from the future, GME will reach $1000 today 🌚
Show us your puts then
bought the dip half an hour ago up 10%. Lord XL
Personally I think Mara is overhyped at this point. There are other companies with much better hash rates that are going to pull far ahead of Mara in the coming months.
Gme calls
What the hell INO

Man I hope not. Have 14 contracts expiring today 😂 most are very in the money but a few aren’t
Holy shit oc.gn had 900million trades yesterday. If it dips below 2 today im loading up
XL stahpppp. Let me get some more before you rocket again
Right now the stock is just pumped up by wsb. This company is priced as if it is already the amazon of video games. We are running off the ps5 hype but once that dies down people will see they are bagholding. Video games are moving to the cloud. Soon no one will ever go into a game store it will all just be bought on steam and consoles will just be downloadable
Yea question is how far does it fall before it’s at a “buy”
Good idea! Get half as much for double the cost of two weeks ago!
Shares maybe although CRMs are getting fragmented IMO by smaller companies focusing on specific niches 

They do own slack, heroku and some other stuff though
Positions or ban

BABA is turning my christmas hellish
Get rich like babababiden
That sounds like a plan.
third point with 2.5mil shares of BABA just went GUH
I’m starting to see that, the decay is real and something not to mess with
Definitely not. Zero appeal there. Why pair up with a shitty auto manufacturer when there are plenty of others that are more tech savvy and ahead of the curve
What are the rumors
You probably meant to say “expired worthless”
NGGA please
Shares guy here and I’m feeling sick to stomach
I was pretty upset about buying WMT calls right before the opioid rumor lawsuit but now I’m just thankful I sold my BABA calls for a profit last week. A true Christmas miracle
You have no self confidence, my big dick comment will get tons of upvotes
Well, ultimately the government has to perform its function as a social safety net. Which means taxes are redistributive in nature. That’s why they’re percent driven and progressive. The more you received from society, the more you have, and the more you will give back to keep society running.
Should i buy the 12/31 25C?
Xl just went -7 to +7 loool
Well they should actually
I think I just became more retarded. Which means more 🚀🚀🚀🚀

Diamond handed pirate here ama
Oh, I get it, yeah. But I was more thinking about the, for the lack of the better word, "real", "legit" long positions, rather than these artificially created ones.

Also, isn't it like, illegal to lend a long position that's already been bought from someone who sold it to you short? Because if a long position is lended to a short seller, and that short seller creates a second long position, and that second long position is then lended and sold short, that means we can theoretically have infinite short interest?! That doesn't sound right...

I'm not sure if I'm asking that question correctly...

I understand that 100%+ shorted outstanding shares is happening due to this massive, multi-layer shorting going on, but yeah, I think at some point even SEC would be like "huh? that's fucking illegal!"
Apple should team up with Ford. You heard it here first.
My wife has a peloton. It is an oversized iPad on a stationary bike with their own set of cult videos.
No one is at $20.. its up 2.5% premarket. At open it will be a little over $21 a share
And yes.. everyone is buying shares today. No matter the cost
Once all this settles down, BABA is going to be biggest opportunity!
My wife’s boyfriend would love this for Christmas.

Yeah, I know all that.

I mentioned in several comments that there were quite a lot of shares to be had in the $16s.

IMO, there are going to be a lot between $22 and $24.

Seeing 3m shares push through in about 5 minutes which only took it from $21.50 to $22 suggests to me there are an awful lot right around $22.

GME was a value play for quite a number of larger holders who came in late 2019 or early 2020.  They had a specific exit in mind, most likely.  They aren't growth investors, and their analysis probably hasn't changed, even with Cohen involved, at the moment.

They're "cigar butt" investors.

We'll see.
It’s SIR Jacks a Lot, sir

The nightmare scenario will be if Xi does to BABA what putin has done to many Oligarchs he disapproved of in Russia...

How are tech stocks looking? Everything took a massive dump, E.g. Cloudflare in the last 10 minutes of trading. And these stocks are barely up 0.7% pre market. Is it going to be more selling over today due to the Christmas holiday and the weekend?

It’s actually not as bad. Pltr has a legitimate argument as a company. The only reason these morons keep parroting GME is because some guy is telling them this mythical short squeeze will happen. There is 0 value in the underlying stock, it’s just a technical play that I would guess maybe 1% of the people saying “GME GME GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀” even understand
i bought shares the calls seemed exp, but i woulda made more on the calls lol

Can anyone make a bull case ? Or explain flatness over months ? Maybe I’ll hold through next ER....
Bough a small position in OPEN yesterday. PT of this stock is in the 80's
Merry Christmas anyway, retard
This is the dumbest post of all time.

WSBis a degenerate gambler who puts everything on black time and again and hopes to win. This year, they did it at the best time in the last 13 years. Let’s not pretend it’s because they have some great “financial psyche.” Really they are gamblers who will go to 0 and most investors won’t. 

What’s comical to me is that nobody recognizes this and now all these “traders” are walking around like Warren Buffett. It’s gonna be fun reading this sub next year. Gonna see a lot of kids lose their asses.
Just curious, at what point during the reform you'll admit you're wrong?
Yea, I know! Buying ROPE atm
Just curious, what is your basis for this position?

There are plenty of other stocks with similar gains, are they all musicals chairs?

Hurry! I haven't ever sent her any bear memes it's gotta mean something!
Just the self-fulfilling info I needed to YOLO. Love PLTR, going deeper!
My bet is a $21.50 open on GME.

Edit 21.50
Looks like BABA is catching some bids around 230
Proof?
Tbf. He's right.

 Seems like the bulls are trying to cover their tracks. The one post I can think of I'd seen in undelete was the one where the op stated, something to the effect, I'll invest 100k in pltr if the post gets 10k up votes.

This place got too much attention recently. And I have a feeling they threw someone under the bus. 

I'm guessing this is far from over.
I’ll buy BABA if it gets close to $200
Nope, too pussy
I think $25, but I'd still prefer a reality where you are right and I'm wrong.
Sell it when it's worth 50% more than it was when you bought it.  Or more.  But sell it before it's worth less than it was when you bought it or keep holding it until the new year when it goes poof and disappears.
BABA puts at open?
Open the fucking market. I need to put a load in FLIR. 🚀 $50
right on the dot
Yes... 1000 at market open.
I just told my boomer uncle 

To go fuck himself for telling me to put my 

Money in a index fund and retire care free at 65 years of age

Well that’s good, you clearly won’t need any lube while you beat off to yourself.  


^(gross dude)
Yeah, the efficient market theory holds true
hey, my gf said the same thing...
Sell all your positions that are down money(if any) to offset your gains
Thankfully I'm already down 50% on my BABA position. Can't go down that much more!
Lol. GME actually went up. Still if you gave me $100, I'd put it in a penny stock.
BUY NGA IF U LIKE MONEY

If you told me 6 months ago that the Russell 2000 would end up being a better trade than Chadsdaq I would have laughed.

Why, This place is going out of business Dude.

They sell physical copies to a console generation that offer 100% digital consoles.

The future is Game pases/subscriptions.

Walmart and target sell the same physics games cheaper, literally no competitive edge or advantage.

This company makes money once every six year when a new console generation comes out.

Nothing they sale I can’t get cheaper in a few hours from Amazon.
They’re not going to do shit

I have 12 shades of baba at 283 so I’m kind of hoping the blood bath ends lol
NOBODY MOVE!
I’m waiting for that shit to DUMP at open
Wait for it to stabilize. Dont buy a leap on a huge down day, IV is going to be high as fuck

The spending is wasteful, billions of dollars go to other countries. 900B to send out $600 checks which cost 200b. So where’s the other $2400? Wasted.
He is probably so hard rn
“STIC U” equals 1 common stock and 1/3 warrant
BSBR is up 80% last 3 months - so calls on BSBR?
All BABA calls just became FD's expiring today
The CCP ain’t the DOJ dawg. The CCP is made up of competing families who want a piece of Jack’s pie. I’m not touching Baba for a while.

Poor dude was fuckin tweaked.
Are Baba calls the move?
At least this guy has a working prototype
Nice but plug
Went there yesterday. Current business model is terrible and they are more expensive than competitors locally. If it “squeezes” it will go back to penny stock eventually. Shit company

Haha awesome brother. Made me smile especially bc I'm going to be spending Christmas alone.... cheers from SE Michigan.
Edit- Only alone bc of a covid scare going around my immediate family.
I’m a man of the people. In conclusion, BABA 300 EOD
I’m afraid it’ll be another situation like Luckin Coffee earlier this year where it went up to around $50 quickly then fall to almost nothing even faster after an a similar antitrust allegation
“I Squeezed”
Baba. The only stock actually undervalued based on fundamentals and look what is happening to it. Stocks with no fundamentals (hello QS) to the moon. This market 🤡

Regular income tax. With deduction and shit, the effective rate should be around 20% so 20k-25k
me neither, which is why I stopped paperhanding and converted to the full-blown 💎👐religion
IMO, wouldn't buy calls for anything until next week or the new year, could be a lot more profit taking/rebalancing.  Remember that massive selloff of Dec 2018?

Man I truly feel bad for BABA call holders
Someone really feels guilty about touching you as a kid
It really doesn’t matter if the company has a product or profit or not. As long as we can profit off the stock

Trump may as well have kicked them in the nuts.  If they tank the bill now they’re probably not going to win the senate in Georgia.
He gave a speech critical of Chinese government regulators and banks. So they fucking ruined him
His point is that you can’t be assigned with naked puts- you don’t have the cash to buy the shares by definition. You probably mean cash secured puts?

I mean I’m the one with 10k loss porn posted so no 😂
I thought the same thing around 255. Surely it couldn't go below 255.

<Narrator: It went well below 255>
If we get pinned under $22 today with GME, I hope everyone goes all in on FDs. This thing bout to blast off

In anything else?

GME now is basically where TSLA was a year ago. Lots of doubters out there, but in 6 months I'm expecting a 5 for 1 stock split and this baby being one of the top 5 holdings in the S&P 500 by market cap.

First hour is bullish as fuck, almost always. Today is a shorter day, could be even more berserk in the first 30-60 minutes than usual.

Be ready for a massive pushback by shorties fighting for their lives. We may get 1 or few negative articles shilling sell-off and "this stock overvalued hurr durr". It may or may not happen, they've been awful quiet over the last 2 days, but wounded lion is usually the deadliest lion, cuz it has very little to lose and is more prone to go all out, paws blazing.

Really should’ve dated them longer to avoid theta decay which is huge in the last 30 days. These may print  but i don’t see a big run up before end of January. IV will also fuck you. 2.00 in premium for that option is waayyyyy too high. Good luck though.
You're better off just stealing this money and forge some false loss porn saying you lost it all
Is this funny because Musk founded the bank x.com?
You are a fucking tard if you buy Baba at open
Trump said the bill contains too much wasteful spending, and the wasteful spending should be given to the American people instead, which is why he recommends $2000 instead of 600. The bureaucrats take that as, $2000,+$600, +the wasteful spending. Insanity. They’ve been pulling shit like that since Nixon was president, and Milton Friedman proposed the negative income tax... TO REPLACE welfare. What ends up happening, congress votes to add a negative income tax to all the existing welfare, and the support fell apart. Guess what’s going to happen with this stimulus? Same shit.
We will be here to laugh with you when you win in the end and laugh at you if you lose. I’m new here but am learning. Peace be with you brother 💎🙌
Ok so the GME short squeeze is real. Has anyone considered what might happen afterwards? I mean, GME is still a piece of shit. What's actually gonna happen when the squeeze is over?
Penny stocks are shares traded under 5 bucks with a low market cap. You're thinking of just a small cap stock. Commonly misunderstood.

Regardless, a market cap of 172 mil is pretty small. Either definition makes it a penny stock

That's not to say companies don't pay out the fucking nose for the software, and get locked into infinite contracts for it.

BABA 300 EOD from China Street pumping the fuck out of this. I take no responsibly for the losses acquired by not understanding satire.
Baba, and all other businesses in China, exist only as long as the whims of the entirely unaccountable government allow them to. In America the megacaps own the government. China is the exact opposite.

This is going to cost them a LOT of fucking money, millions. 

In order for them to save some of that money they need to buy into gamestop, raising the demand for gMe stop, FAST.

Sorry to those who bought baba calls yesterday. I was very tempted after recovering at my support buy level of $252.70s but glad I didn’t hold them over night
I hope you guys make a fuck ton of money, but I just don’t see how GameStop is going to be able to resurrect itself as the one-stop-shop for gamers online. It already has an iffy reputation amongst the nerd crowd, and it’s well known they sort of dont treat their employees very well. Just doesn’t seem like a logical investment to me. But like I said... I hope to see you all on the moon. T S N P gang will take you in when you’re ready.

There's some Chinese American guy reading this and there's some Chinese equivalent to twitter where he follows Xi Jinping and he's making bank going along with Xi doing insider trading based on Xi's subtle telegraphing of his upcoming moves. This week is gonna be a solid 40-bagger for the man I'm speaking of but he won't share any of it with us. He's not telling us about this Chinese Twitter equivalent and giving us translations of little things Xi says. Why not? I ask you, mysterious Chinese lurker, why do you selfishly lurk and refuse to participate? I would give you my retarded advice if I thought it could help you, why won't you give us yours?

He won't answer. If he's reading this, he's laughing at me for asking. But I know you're out there, underground Chinese trader guy

Why?
Fucking pls
Just because Ma insulted everyone over there. Literally wouldve been fine if he hadnt started getting full of himself
Actually all the cheap shit people bought of AMZN came from BABA. She’ll be back.
If u wanna buy baba don't buy right away I feel this shit may tank more after a small bounce
Reminds me of my past relationships
I swear some of these guys are trading options and moonlighting as a meme maker it should be the other way around.
It's funny, USA or EU launch antitrust or monopoly shit at AMZN, APPLE, MSFT, FB, GOOG and they falter 1-2% on a bad day..   
  
BABA gets in the CCP cross hairs and gets fucking mutilated.

Not a guh till we sell
How stupid are my WFC leaps
Funny how rapidly sentiment changes. When BABA was flying at 300/share in anticipation for the ANT ipo, it was an amazing buy, great fundamentals, going to be the Chinese amazon and rocket. 

Now that it’s sitting at being almost negative YTD and down 30% from its top, it’s a shit Chinese scam stock and will bankrupt you, even if you go long

lol I aspire to one day be autistic enough to give my nephew $50k to yolo and expect for a cut in the profits (losses) 🥴. Your uncle is definitely on here
Still odd to see JD drop with them, considering this is clearly pretty bullish news for JD
Does this dude even pay attention? GME is going to squeeze harder than you’re wife’s boyfriend’s face during his vinegar strokes.

It's gunna easily double so not at all. I bought at $18+ which is pretty high, the dip would have been nice but hey ho.

Because I agree but I wonder how accurate that assessment is on the general public. Like what % of people think like that and wouldn't go shopping? I personally think we overestimate that. 

There are also some tangential things I could see going well for gamestop, I dont quite know how they would happen, but one of which would be somehow partnering with/just making their own Google stadia/Nvidia gamestream or something. There's too much chaos in how that could be done though, but Imagine the rest
Have you lived under a rock for the past month? The only chance that boomer shit has a chance of moving is with next earnings announcement. Everything else priced in.
GME calls expiring next week. Might not be 1 day but it might more than double.

Dude sentiment with baba right now is very negative I would not buy it. A lot of big money put buying over the last couple weeks. But Im retarded so
GME to the moon, you should reallocate that 2k
There was some demented autist here who had predicted BABA would hit $220 in a month a month back and I had laughed at him. That was uncannily accurate.

So is baba a buy after today?
 Who bought baba puts? Bc my dumbass sure didn’t
Please don’t weak hand bft and sell before Christmas the gains are going to be 2x bagger type shit

what stocks are on your watchlist for today?
That's because steel gang (MT, VALE, FCX etc) has entered the cryo chambers and are going to wake up in 3 months for some sick gains.
😍
It is in China. With the BABA/ANT shenanigans the CCP is just proving once again that you really can't trust chinese stocks.
GME
Plus a double bottom would of already occurred
Nah, not 50%... All you really have to do is pull out before you blow your load.

Know the difference between 99.999 and 99.999999 so you never -100.00%

That was my problem. I put billions, maybe trillions in CDs... and that blew up.

Then I got cocky and did it again.

I have made a million for sure, but I will never see a dime.

...probably not even a dirty penny at the current interest rate.
Serious baba tanks
dope.
Not good, ty for asking!
BRNS
They said the same last month. Didnt turnout better for them.
I say we declare war on China, everyone buy some fake knockoff shit from eBay right now, the money will be funneled into BABA to fight back against the CCP!

Sorry to hear that
Can’t wait for all the dip shits continuing to play BABA options throughout all of this to come back next week with their accounts down 90%
> THERE ARE SO MANY FUCKING THINGS YOU CAN BUY THAT AREN’T CHINESE

Tell that to our corporations, since they're the ones who chose to outsource all their shit to chase more dollars and leave us with less jobs.

Either way, enjoy your ban, retard.
This meme is me but... are we selling eventually? Like before earnings or after in April? Or should I just diamond hand this forever? Am retarded pls help.

Short GME
My first PLTR position will be opened today
My Ali Baba long positions I bought at 300 totally agree with you. Although Baba is now at 229 after hours cuz Xi has a hard on for Jack Ma

It is definitely not too late. Gamestop started branching out to other gadgets like phones, drones, VR, tablets... etc etc

Margin on them used is 20-50%. There is no other business that is known for trading used devices the way they are known to worldwide.

On new consoles, they only make 10% and look how much they go up on console cycles.

From here on out EVERY year will be 3X profit of console release year. 

It will AT LEAST double in the next month.

Sorry guys.  Mistyped -_-
For the long-run i guess so
Too ugly to be hired by KFC
Still, though, generally individual investors (ie people on this sub) aren't buying calls to exercise them. Like the dude above said, you buy assuming the intrinsic value will go up so you buy OTM calls because you think they will go ITM or closer to ITM to fight theta so you sell for a gain or you buy ITM calls because you think they will get deeper ITM, again, to sell the option for a gain, not exercise it. That way you can reap the upside of options without needing the capital to exercise.
I was almost negative 5k at one point

Thanks for telling us some points. Also thanks for not making another steal is going to moon chart.
This year has taught me to stop doubting my vibe, called the rises of GRWG, QS, FUBO, ICLN and few others and also timed PLTR's top. Only problem is I'm too retarded to hold (except ICLN). I've dodged out of market dips pretty well and my worst play was FOMO'ing into TSLA this past Monday. Gonna try to to keep listening to myself and hold. MCFE 1/15 $20c

So we're pumping penny stocks here now?
Aunt Cathie is indeed bae af. I like ARKG and want LEAPS, but options only trade a year out. ARKK is the LEAPS choice with options expiring in 2023. 

The play: ARKK LEAPS, ARKG shares. 

“Shares” are an exotic option that never expire. They’re expensive, but you can own them forever. Worth looking into.

You cannot fucking escape GME on this sub

I’m actively trying to find other shit and it’s just GME GME GME ALL IN GME 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
Should print. Holding shares myself
Aight, so the only thing I don't fully accept is the peculiar koinkidink yesterday, when that massive 62,000 put purchase at 2:13 PM coincided with the big dump in price, basically both happened at the exact same time.

Is that just because that massive put position sent a bearish signal on its own, or is it some 4D chess type of cause & effect chain reaction due to how, well, option shit interacts with stock shit? Or is it that both the massive put buy was co-ordinated with a massive short position as a double whammy, but they are not directly related, they were both just done as part of tutes manipulating like tutes be manipulating all along?!  


Or is it like, "well, hard to tell exactly, but could be that, could be also 7 other different scenarios that end up in a same/similar outcome?"
I think a wheel needs to be initiated with a cash secured put.
There’s a chill in the wind today. I can feel it in loins, GME will be erecting the biggest greenest dildo we’ve seen yet.
Can’t buy the ICLN dip if there never is a dip
What stock dumbass
Baba bagholders , how u feelin?
All I hear is can someone do some DD for me cause I’m a spoiled little bitch.
have fun
It looks like people are telling you to get back in now!!!! And HOLD!!!
Basically this post boil down to:

1. Buy stonks
1. Buy more stonks
Looks like something I would buy then sell when it inevitably drops.

Not wheeling the naked puts. Using naked puts to get assigned the position and then start wheeling. I'll just keep selling naked puts until it pulls back, I get assigned, then use those shares to start wheeling.

Cheers for the wall of text, it's much appreciated, honestly. Merry Christmas and may tendies print tenfold in 2021 for you.

I mean I have over 200k and I wouldn’t be able to justify a 60k car purchase when a 2016 Camry is like 10k.

12/24 AAPL anyone? I'm shitting my pants. If I see my trades go green I'm fucking selling as soon as I can

Is AAPL going to moon? Otherwise just fucking get me rope today on my 12/24 calls.

If you had $300 Jan 2022 leaps. What would you do? Hold em? Fold em? Double down?
how do you wheel naked puts?  you get assigned via margin?
When going out and dropping 60K feels like going out and dropping 3K on a TV without putting yourself in debt, then it's ok.

WSB has "bets" in the name for godsakes.

Also, technical analysis like super and resistance levels and trading based on candlesticks is pure bullshit. That's all imaginary. There's no such thing as a support level. A certain price only looks like one if that's what you're looking for and then it's only a support level until something in the business, broader economy or market changes (all of which happen constantly).

If you're making picks based on this stuff, you might as well just use a dart board.

That said, there is some advice in here. Going short on the market is an almost surefire way to lose. Everyone wants to be Michael Burry and out-smart everyone by going short. But you know why he's featured in a movie? Because he was among the 
.00001% of investors who made a killing in that crash and outsmarted us all. Don't be a fool and trade based on the idea that you're going to be in that .000001%.

Mga will benefit from all the EV manufacturers as well
Real scenario on wash sales — I bought PLTR $25 calls 11/27 in November @ $0.14 and exercised two contracts on 11/25. Sold the rest for nice profit. Cost basis on the shares from the exercised contracts is $25.14 per share.

Around the same time, I bought a bunch of OTM PLTR $35c 11/27, $40c 12/04 and $35c 12/18 that expired worthless. Am I able to recognize this short-term loss on these contracts? Or, do these losses increase my cost basis of my shares?
They were before, not anymore. Model definitely not extinct but they need a slight change of direction in the digital world along with some stores too. Guarantee this hits 30 before 10. I wouldnt get excited if there is a 5-10 down day though its gone up 50% in a couple weeks already which is amazing

Respect. Wish u the best of luck
I don't invest, I just lurk in this sub for the memes. But jesus christ, the cojones you need to have to just yolo 200k on something like this. I'd have a heart attack. Which is basically why I just lurk.
wut r the best SPACs rn?
Don’t be mad.

I noticed a thing.   You don’t have to believe it.   You can dig around yourself.  Or we can keep going until you figure it out.

I. Noticed. A. Change. In. Content. Being. Removed.

Like you spend enough time in different zones, you start to get vibes for the different zones.  In the last two days I’ve felt a lot of “weird, why did this get deleted.”   And then the amount of feeling that increased a whole lot.  

You can choose to accept that I feel a thing, or you can ask stupid questions and rage when I don’t give a fuck.

When is PLTR going back to $20 so I can buy in?
Once again. I’m holding 50 fucking 2 dollar He Xo 1/15 calls. After the reverse split, its trading around 4. Why are these still worthless? 

I’m obviously too hungover to Google and already wrote off the 500 dollar loss, I’m just curious.
I don't own jd anymore but shouldn't JD profit from this (if this was a rational market). I am confused as to why they are bleeding too.
I’m sure you could do that on your own time with your own money instead of the cheap or free vaccine but when it comes down to it, it’s only for your peace of mind and not necessary. I’m 100% sure there are antibody test studies ongoing, but why would they recommend everyone get one? Or whatever OP is implying by hearing about them more? It’s unnecessary.
[removed]
Yes,please. I need you to stop my bleeding.
Going to start selling naked puts on PLUG in hopes of getting assigned. Going for that wheel strat

So uhhh who’s buying that baba dip ?
Fuckin yeet it you autist.
Buy shares
At open your calls will be down an ungodly amount. Baba will sell off all day. This is not the kind of news that a stock shakes off. Institutional investors are selling before hours. Everyone else will jump in after open. Those calls will probably be down 90%. Could try to buy puts with the other 15% but might just want to eat crow and move on. Buying a put on baba at open will be hard to do and it's going to be a mad dash for the exits.
I gave an award on this post. This is legit info. Thank u!!!
Buy RTX, for those missiles being fired at Iran!
Doubt it. At least not 2021 with that U.K. strain and not enough doses. Anywho, buying a house nowadays using the same concept for many years is outdated and needs a new concept. Just how ppl used to go to malls, that’s outdated by online shopping.

Warrants or shares at this point?
My two cents on BABA and you can buy/sell/wank whatever with it.

What makes you think someone like the CPP who doesn’t give a fuck about violating global human rights laws, has thousands of fraudulent companies using US patents, and promotes mass censorship gives a flying fuck about a company like Alibaba being successful if their CEO forgets what hood he’s in.

What we’re going to see is a literal example being made of Jack Ma. They’re going to ensure that future CEOs of companies like JD or NIO won’t forget who’s really in charge, or so help them God, the CCP will make sure their companies fail and they’ll lose some non-vital organs to boot.

Fuck Xi, fuck the CCP, fuck their dictatorship, all in NIO leaps
Do we think the market sells off at open?
STIC STIC STIC
Those two comprise 100% of the stocks I own, so I'm down
Puts on ETSY
[removed]
Its just the beginning but having big contracts like this promotes the company and others will get in. 

Dont forget we are talking about trucks here and each of them are about 300k. so 2500x300k = $750M order. Great start from just 1 company ordering. Compare this to other EV companies that dont even make anything yet and have much higher market cap.
Nah, go for it. Just finance and drop the rest on tsla leaps. Pays for itself!

Tech investors. People didn't use Uber less... People probably found it safer than mass transit. All the while QQQ was super bullish
Where?
broken up companies are often worth more than the sum of their parts, BABA will survive
i might buy BABA though after that long speech. if i get it at 200$ ill go in for sure
Yo what if Xi and Jack are Lowkey best friends and they just shaking out all American paper hands so they can get cheaper shares before BABA literally sells the Chinese every item ever.
SHARES not stocks
BABAs going down not where I would've put it but I'm no psychic, could pull a fast one and surge to the moon.
We have AMZN
Haven’t heard any news that he did.
Is she single?
60k. Are you dumb? How much thinking did that take
BABA puts at open. Xi is on your side. Can’t fail.

Definitely gonna buy baba at the open...just not sure about shares or options
Yeah but who the fuck are you
Wtf happen to steel?
Just venmo it to me
how many tickers does this guy’s last name have?
This is most likely
I do have a friend on this sub that sold a week ago and lost his ass.

At 18.5 I’ll be making a tiny profit at least. Maybe I’ll luck out though...
Technical analysis is a joke anyways considering that stock returns follow a random walk
IMAX theaters were the best.
It’s all Xi
Oh look another wsb knock off sub
I ain’t reading all that

I’m happy for you though

Or sorry that happened
Because if you buy from AMZN you actually are just buying from BABA.
this is awesome!
i got 2023 apple calls and got fucked it tanked 40% but i just waited 2 months and they are up 20% now, dumped a bunch and bought all these spacs and went up even more, leaps cost a bit more but so worth it. but with this BABA shit you dont even know what they are doing in china its scarier

Yeah, and if you don't pull out when they do, you get pregnant.
I guess she gonna go -50% EoY
If the threat of being delisted in America didn't do much to it, it should be fine over this BABA thing. It does make me reconsider investing in Chinese companies, though. As if there wasn't reason enough already.
Yeah I have been able to!
No, they won’t allow BABA to fail. It’s the closet thing to AMZN they have, and China wouldn’t give up such a huge foothold to international markets for whatever is going on...it would be an irrational decision. You do you, but BABA is a solid company, especially if you don’t care to hold for years. I wouldn’t average in (at least not now), but no point selling at a loss
Dynavax is the way. Buy Lo sell high.
Not too late for shares. Calls are crazy expensive so I'd pass.


If the projections are right and it rockets to even half of what people are saying, you'll make a good 50% in a few months.

This shit is survivorship bias to the max.  You got lucky as balls dude. The thing that resonates with me is the part where you are going to school so that you are never nonessential again. I am an ICU nurse, better yet a travel nurse. It has been raining tendies.  There are contracts right now for $7000/week to take COVID patients. I have the extra now to play with options. If I lose some money, fuck it, I’ll always be able to eat. You are retarded to do what you did with your wife relying on you but whatever.  

So I also kind of resonate with the fuck it mentality. I’m thinking of starting an only fans to pad my options account.  If nothing else, I’ll get some laughs and memes out of it.
Honestly? Not yet late. If you're willing to keep it for a couple months, then surely you will be able to close position at 50%+ gain

Yea invest seems to be fine. But honestly anyone doing CFDs there is dumb :( 

I wish someone told me. This shit isn’t free I paid ~6k in swaps. Spreads are ridiculous and they made me sell half my portfolio due to the margin change which in the end “only” affected about 70 stocks. Basically could’ve kept holding and be up at least 50k more...

Yeah, I can afford to hold long term. Thinking I'll risk rather than selling at a loss. The question is will the CCP actually kill BABA? I just dont know anymore. Todays gonna hurt anyway.
Stay away from it, as a Chinese, I m telling you, Chinese gov is not happy with Jack Ma
Ok, so that’s when you buy.....but do you ever sell?

Not in China, being poor and losing is the only way over there.
It's temporary. They know the game.
The coup in Bolivia didn't happen of course 😁😁

I regret buying baba calls at 270. Kill me
Time for the weekly mental exercise of what to do if my PLTR shares get assigned
it's a dumpster fire
Was just out walking my dog and a Flying Spur with the license plate "Maui Jim". I'm not one for coincidences, but I think this means PLTR /45 EOY

Cash out enjoy your holiday
Bet the chinese government buys a shit ton of BABA calls today 🤣
SQ gonna print. It's the next to enter Spoo
🚀
My entire account was green yesterday...took profit
BABA gonna hit -20% today. Good luck to y’all ☠️
Shares are my plan.
Okay does China not have a Wall Street that own a shit ton of BABA shares because it’s their bread and butter over there? Are they not pissed about all this as well?
You're got damn right it was.

Amazons chart is tighter than a nuns asshole rn, and historically January is one of their best months of the year for returns. Time to position yourself accordingly

GME TIME BOIS AND GURS!!!! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
Watch people not buy this BABA dip and chase it when the investigation is over.

Opendoor Technology Inc.  - Google it. Long answer short, they make it easy to buy and sell houses online. Hot market specially now that covid makes it harder to deal w ppl face to face
Ok guys, I’ve been thinking and hear me out:

This short squeeze meme it’s basically imposible, let’s be honest, it’ll go up but it won’t go to the ridiculous prices of 100+ right? Seems imposible right?

But hear me out: THIS IS FUCKING 2020, THE YEAR OF IMPOSIBLES!

THINK OF ALL THE CRAZY SHIT THAT HAS HAPPENED THIS YEAR!!!! 
GME 🚀 🚀 🚀
You can read??
It totally sucks man.
I’m with you man

XL gonna be okay?
A real gift would be not closing the markets
Markets close early today degenerates
American companies gain value during anti-trust investigation, while in china , government squeeze your balls. Learn how to play market. Noobs . BABA. 😅
Baba is now only up 7 pct on the year ... really pissed off at the Chinese government this is so undervalued if this was in the USA
There may be enough volatility to make some money on BABA today. Yes I am autistic enough to try.
username checks out
Play the BABA bounce after the weekend

nervous rn cuz all of my holdings have been green af all week, just know something bad has to happen to me lmao
PLTR always tank at open.
What’s the best place to watch futures on mobile
We're F-ed
Yeah a company on the verge of obsolescence and bankruptcy should be worth much more
I don't get why this Alibaba thing is such a big deal, you're SUPPOSED to get monopolies, that's how you win the game 🤔
Need more DD into this.  I’m skeptical
Jack Ma pleas tell winnie the pooh that you're sorry
I don’t think so

BABA is giving one lifetime opportunity. Forget people talking about TSLA, this is the next trillion dollar company  - let China do whatever they want, they wont hurt their golden goose. Let americans sell.
Folks hate on this stock so much here, idk why. 
I got in when it was at 10.40 😎 

This baby is fresh and will explode
Yes
Yes I have this going on with cruise and movie theater.
That would have made no sense. This drop in no way reflects their ability as a company. They are worth over a trillion. It’s just unlucky it’s a Chinese company.
My guess? Baba news dragging it down
Fucking love it!
Cheers
You must have done well, he called it perfectly and everyone laughed at him lol

Been holding 300p 1/8 since the last lockup expiry. Def fucked up getting in so early, but was able to average down nicely when it spiked up to 357 on Tuesday. They needed to keep it propped up until this next lockup expiry but the gloves are coming off next week.
2/19 or 4/19 call for GME today?? Can only afford one
Mods are on a cocain tantrum with OP

Solid entry, it’s just taking a little nap from last weeks massive run
I bought LUV stock the day it was announced and currently up 70%
It’s gonna dump to $100 for a while
I sold too soon fuckkk... Thought +25% was good
$29 after a 10-for-1 stock split 🚀
What site shows you that info? Just curious.

Also, what does OPEN do? Equipment and oilfield rental business management software?? What’s the angle on it?

That's the best time to lift! No one to bother me.
True that man
TSLA has turned into general theta gang
You docked with your dad’s dick and now you’re sad?
Someone finally asking the REAL questions.
my only question now is when are you adding more April/July calls?
Soon red
Big money isn’t betting on it. In fact, they are betting against it. 

Also, Cohen doesn’t impress me and I don’t need anybody to tell me that their business model is extinct. You took take a BUS 101 class and learn that shit.
SQ is gonna be AliPay for the US. Straight to the moon
I can only get so hard
[deleted]
Not anymore they have it down to 10% so really 5% now, and will just get better
Sell the other 15% of your portfolio and buy closer to the money calls. Might as well go down with the ship or buy a new yacht.
It shows that Cathie Wood keeps on buying shares of OPEN on the dip for two of her ETF funds
Why buy puts when you can sell them?
$CUCK
tf is nio doing
your total is gonna be $21.42 for that stale popcorn and tasteless diet coke
There's always someone who has more.  Dont chase others.  Set up a road map of incremental gains.  Where can you be in 1 month, 3 months, 6 months?  Its much more enjoyable to have your own goals and rewards.  You got this Retard.

I’m not going anywhere.
I swear the comment sections are the funniest thing ever, best confirmation bias for every bull lol
how?
Yes, sorry. Bought 4 calls on Monday then cashed out Thursday for a huge profit.
Wait and have a significant other holding you back from going ? Or just saying its bucket list for you

You get taxed on income, your employer also has to pay tax on your wages. You take some of you income to put in the market to make some extra cash, that gets taxed too if you make anything. You buy a house and have to pay property taxes for as long as you own it. One day you build up a nice savings and pass it on to your children/family, that’s taxed too. You can’t escape taxes.
That’s the risk you take. Everything is what if. If you want a huge thrill with high risk high reward, this is the chance. True WSB degens are buying baba leap calls today.
😂😂 she’s been buying for a long time fool. I’m just showing how she keeps buying while the stock goes down
Are you fucking dumb
BuY tEh dIP!!! 🤣🤣🤣
Made me laugh, Merry Christmas Rocket Kids, and fuck you Gay bears!
Baba at the end of the day will be dirt cheap.

Die BABA you pos. You havent done shit for the past few months.
Weak
You should all in on BABA 12/24 calls
🇺🇸 🦅
??????
I mean, fundamentally it actually is
If you don’t need the money, just hold BABA. This will pass. BABA has a competent management and right now tensions are just high. If you don’t need it, just pretend you don’t have it. I know it hurts to look at, but look at every major dip, what is the one thing that has always happened after each dip?
Short baba or long GME? Asking for a yolo
SQ in talks to buy Tidal, love it
Merry Christmas everyone of you cucks.
Lol it’s like when people say they buy every dip. Why are you even here if you have that kinda money lol
Definitely will. Probably gonna hit 40-50 with the fomo short term
A) AZN, like all covid pharma is played out. And 2) I’ve seen better DD from a 5th grader

Should have sold 2 days ago and Bought the dip again, hope it rides back up
How the fuck would Santa not be real? I literally had sex with him in the mall bathroom 🤔
U might aswell hold
Just make sure you’re buying actual shares or leap calls please. Short calls is a death trap

We are dead sir...CCP on his ass. Jack Ma is fooked - even he’s selling shares
5500 shares, April calls 7 9c, 15 13c, 20 20c. Also sold 18 10 puts
CCP making a perfect entry into Steve
Well of course if I buy puts it will go up. If I wanted to prove my point I’d have to buy calls. Fortunately I’m too poor for either of these things.
I was joking lol
Today will be a 5.5 hour power hour where the market rips.  Christmas is tomorrow, which is the most bullish holiday of the year.  2021 is around the corner and all the homies are gonna want to get into their positions before that face ripper of a year starts.  Also we’re getting unlimited stimmy.  Finally, stonks have been not going up the past couple days so we gotta make up for that today.

Depends on how much you got and how far out the calls are. Tbh I might not average down unless I held a leap, this could be bad for awhile.

Google COVID reinfection. Why do you think there are two vaccine doses spread out and not just one? Even the CDC says it is possible to be reinfected.
Honestly - im cool with a dip... I get more shares on a discount...... Im not selling! 0 or 100 a share..... FUCK YOU BOOMERS - Im not selling.....  


Only way I sell is when RC makes me a 7 figure bank account

After such a huge run who knows.. but i am keeping an eye on it
No fucking clue.
I think the 6th of jan. You can double check [here](https://spactrack.net/)
Same..... country?
Haha, maybe it's their business plan, garbage trucks... loosely interpreted
Who cares? You’d get your BABA shares split into 3 companies as well.
But if you can't send living things through, how tf is Vorinclex there?
Stap makin soft things hard.
Thanks for this, I’m selling my calls at open and gonna buy back eoy
Not really.
Maybe. I still think the squeeze isn’t happening yet and that it’ll retract some, then flatten for a while. IV is insane right now, so FDs are still pretty expensive. 

FWIW, I bought 12/24 $15.50c on Monday for $0.55 when GME was trading around $15.00 (and then sold on Tuesday for $3.00...not a big bet, just 10).
After I fucking sell after holding for 6 moths of course
Puts on BABA at open?
Damn Baba just keeps getting destroyed. Should have bought puts when it was in the 300s.
Tech unicorn that loses billions of dollars and no clear path to profitability?  NUT.
Average down on baba calls ?
We don't ask for much, just that it rockets to $100.  Once there, then we will ask for more
And moved the money into something else that’s moving. Something to be said about dead money. If he sold Airlines at the bottom in April/May and dumped it all in TSLA, then what?
Literally bought both last week, no shame!
I have a feeling this comment won't age well either
Thank you, and merry Christmas to you!

I'm really excited about the growth potential of the area. Between WEC, we also have new warehouses from Amazon, chewy, FedEx, autozone.

Ocala is already home to the largest custom firetruck factory in the world, the largest medical marijuana farm in the state, and our Sheriff made INTERNATIONAL headlines by refusing to let his officers wear masks.

Cleared the dirty dishes out of my room, loaded the washer & cleaned the sink, got some laundry done and did 100 push-ups

It must be the holiday spirit or something but it feels way better to wake up and get something done before open (6:30 in Cali). Spread the love y’all leave a clean sink if you have fam

Edit and if you don’t have fam clean something for yourself that’s the point
Harry is not loyal? 😱
If BABA actually opens around 230 I may be forced to buy the fucking dip
Last chance to get in BFT at anything remotely close to NAV it looks like. Won't be under $15 for a while and could double early Jan
I’m taking my own observations of the sub into consideration.

I watch both WSB and the deleted side equally and constantly. 

I noticed a change.  

You can accept that I feel that way, or you can continue with this terribly middle school level examination of what I think.  Which, as I’ve said, barely goes beyond “a thing is happening.”

One more time:  Fuck if I know, find your own conclusions.  Be aware that someone said they saw an issue.
What if alibaba gets broken up after chinas monopoly investigation
i bought puts on gme
Pissed off pooh bear.
Good luck to you bro, I was tempted last night but seeing how much further it fell overnight got me scurr.

Hope your Christmas is great and your baba boldness is rewarded!
You are crazy this isn’t a dip.. this is China stepping in and telling them they are getting to big for there britches.... I’m yoloing puts

My options are flat but the underlying asset is going up? What gives man?
I’m guilty of skimming through that since it was so long but halfway I saw I smoked a fat joint.
Nailed It! 🚀
Every dollar up GME moves is $10k from my calls. Let’s GOOOOoOoOoOio
If you’re up pretty big then go back to making the level of trades you started with.  As you make more money you usually risk more with every trade. You won’t get rich quick but you’ll at least not be stagnant.
So good to see actual information on here and not just a recycled meme about PLTR

Tesla won’t be dominate in the ev field. I think Tesla’s valuation will keep rising but that will be due to other things such as autonomous fleets and their battery technology. It’s been shown Tesla hasn’t really been able to gain a big slice of vehicle market share and with large auto manufacturers switching to ev soon it will be hard for Tesla to really eat into large autos market share.
am i the only one that has drawn away from the reality? i can spend hundreds on GME, PLTR stocks while i cant even afford a date with my homie's girl friend

How can bears call a market top, disappear for the rally, and then come back and call the next market top like they dont deserve to be tarred and feathered

Yes

It’ll still be overpriced and up-sold, even more so that you’re not paying for the ‘ambience’ or snacks

This is /wsb not /investing - if you ever consider typing the word smart you need to be in a different sub Reddit
Yeah you don't understand whats happening in this sub. Everyone is jumping on the same train and using massive leverage and there's a million of us.  Even if wrong we move the market higher if we all get in.
Buy puts at 25 then. I bet you don’t...
From Stocktwits:

“new court filing yesterday in Jeff Xu’s case. Parties filed joint motion and proposed order for entry of “take nothing judgment”. Means exactly what it sounds like. Judge could sign any day to dismiss case- does NOT have to wait until the 4th now. Appears to be a move to speed things up.”

And GME why did you leave our beloved moon shot out?
godspeed friend
The MOST dystopian future possible:....it is the distant future....president karp has unleashed contracts with every company still standing to carve the world in his vision....and PLTR is at $29 per share....
Can you justify why console big names (Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo) wouldn't rather just have digital content (i.e. game downloads, no discs) direct-to-consumer? Cuts out middle-men like GameStop so no one is fucking with those margins

Unless you believe GME to ONLY be a successful equivalent of a gaming eBay?
Amazon?
Yeah. Donuts way too expensive.
Crushed into the stratosphere like a baseball?
Well it got a 60 dollar price target by analysts.

If you retards aren’t buying into FCEL now, what are you waiting for? This stock is easy money with the Biden admin
apple was flat yesterday, got some nice calls back down to earth level prices
We're the ones who caused that jump yesterday

Did NIKOLA design that road truck?
This is a bit optimistic...
Why was it up 100% yesterday for no reason.
BABA?
Get on board BFT. Before it takes off
Sell it.now. try to make some.money back by selling call spreads..then move.on to something else
I mean, if I close my eyes. Or not
HOLIBABA
This. No harm in it. I got a bit obsessed with checking WSB and RH, kept slowly leaking money and was feeling bad so I stopped for a couple of months. Bought TSLA and stopped checking.
100% profits, but all unrealized gains.
This shit better tank at open. I need to get rid of these puts.  

Gonna move into Fedex calls and LMND puts and see which one blows up my account the fastest.
Vaccines make money, not antibody tests...
Because it went up 90% yesterday you fucking retard
You expect me to read all this shit?
BABA is pretending to fall premarket  🚀  🚀  🚀  It will moon by EOD  🚀  🚀  🚀  Buy the dip  🚀  🚀  🚀  Get in now!
Started July 4k trades CFDs only I’m up ~80k in profits would’ve been 120k+ if my broker trading212 didn’t make a change in margin requirements. 

Prior to joining the market I would’ve never been able to make this much money with like 1 hour of weekly work. It’s a joke it’s unreal and I’m salty because I really would be up 120k+ if t212 wasn’t the biggest CUNT SCAM BITCH company ever. Don’t join this broker if you plan to trade CFDs
WHAT
If I could watch new release movies at home rather than theater, I’ll do. Fuck overpriced, up-sold theater garbage
Ive heard that before

(Fellow bag holder)
I’ve been saying this... people need to be getting the antibody test, not the Covid test, prior to doing their holiday travels
CCP: What a run the past month for all. But as traders looking for short exposure, $BABA is no longer a stock but a full casino. Does not take a ball of crystal to know this will fall back to Arda. Shorting with a $200 2020 target
Baba is safe, Jack Ma on other hand..
stop thinking that having diamond hands makes you a badass ... just cut the loss now before it grows and move your money into something smarter
retard i dont own it but it's dragging down our markets
I'd rather get the coal
Really trying to resist baba 0dte cause I know I’ll manage to lose money as it trades flat
Just go get an antibody test. It's around 180 bucks
Bro you’ve got balls bigger than the GME king to say that around here.
unless winnie puh makes 3 companies out of one and takes what he likes best
Still a LEAP if you buy right at open on expiry day.
May Santa bring you your tendies
Because it’s pretty expensive to do antibody tests if I remember correctly. Also if you had it you can still get it again a few months later.

I fucked up. 

Totally. But at least I know that in 2021 I will fuck up even more.
Why is XL down in premarket for no reason?
You sir, are an idiot.  Fundamentals drive stock prices over time, not nifty patterns. RAD has been in a funk for years. Another Amazon pharmacy announcement would crush them again. Mergers with Albertsons and Wall Greens fell apart.  Stores were sold. Yet, they continue to struggle.  COVID vaccine deployment may be a one time boost — but the company is still facing immense headwinds with competition, their balance sheet, and growth. Your list is Monday morning quarterbacking garbage.

They’re hiring like crazy, Microsoft is scared of them, and institutions are still buying in on these dips
WSB is pumping GME so my guess is it’s going to spike to $25 after 15 mins, RH will break, and it will be down to $17 after 30 mins.
Instead of bags of coal, Santa delivering ded baba 300c’s to the naughty boys and girls this year

YO WHY THE FUCK ARE WE NOT HEARING ABOUT ANTIBODY TESTS 

30%+ of the pop already had covid if you look at recent studies and take time into account 

We don’t know if having vid makes you immune (but most viruses that are beaten by the immune system create some immunity response so probably) but what the fuck I want to know if I have had it and I think this is pretty pertinent info, they can detect the antibodies in blood with great accuracy now so what the fuck is this, I wanna know if I had the vid, shouldn’t be some guessing game and why no news on this fucking eh

What baba calls y’all buying?
merry chrisweed
Baba might go under 100$ by February
!Remindme 80 days
Does China have a Palantir?
It’s not too late to hop back on the train
Can’t wait for PLTR to pump first thing at open and then go from +4% to -4% in the span of 3 minutes 😃
Taking profits and spending the rest of the week with your wife. If i miss the santa rally then i miss it. Been a great year nonetheless
family does not equal enjoyable time, I'm autistic
Baba 200 by open
Damn you fucker
next you should google Bo Xilai for a primer on how quickly the party can strip you of your assets if you fall out of favor with the Politburo.
That’s China
Yikes. When it dips back down you may want to buy back in
Jack Ma getting fucked by Winnie
If you aren't making money off chinese markets and taking a small part of their GDP for over here, the communists have won. Don't let the uyghurs die for nothing. Do your part by stealing chinese money for our use.
No, I wish lol. -10% for fucking BABA. Holy shit someone is about to be rich at open.
Wife and daughter have covid and I'm stuck in our guest room. Gonna be a weird one . Thanks for the love heart same to you
The top
When I see rockets on the side of a tickr I am all in. That's the only indicator I use
Then pick a stock and go semi long and don’t be a pussy
Yeah! That’s what I was saying to some retard yesterday. He told me, “ThAt’s NoT hOw It WoRks.”
Fuk U, We're all retarded here you cuck!  What is google?
I mean baba is pretty much doing the same thing as we speak. It wiped out thousands of investors today
You don't have the degenerate gambler gene then.
This lady on Twitter yelled at me for suggesting that you could use spreads to avoid PDT
Coronavirus is overblown and buy VOO is his core message
I really think there is gonna be an intra day dip. Not from shorts, but from all the virgin take the profit and run boomer lurkers just trying to get back to even on their portfolio
Shut the fuck up
Im not a lawyer or a market maker but there are probably loopholes. Instead of saying "buy option/stock x at this time." Rephrase to "I think buying option/stock at x at this time". Its basically what TD ameritrade Tv does every day. 

But yes you are right, it would be difficult to coordinate where the majority wins.
early close should mean early open!
Penny stock but do the dd on t/r/c/h
Good because I have 130k sitting on 12/31c
Good morning folks...I’m back

What’s the play today?
My FSR - in the money @ $17....looking for that to hit
Looking to buy the FSLY dip...any suggestions

What else is there to play today?
Merry Christmas upside down friend!
Lol
I was told market would rally during the holidays..  yet this entire week has been as flat as a pancake
Docu
are we all buying baba puts today ?
Not going to be bitter about selling at $11 because profit is profit but.....
BABA$ be like : SUM TING WONG
Good Q.

Fuck if I know.  Draw your own conclusions.  I’m only stating what I’ve seen and noticed and trying to get other people watching.

And lololols... no, I had a life before covid.  “Used to thinking like a mod” is some of the gayest wanna-be authority shit I’ve ever heard.

I’m sure all mods are just pristine examples of graceful unbiased moral compass perfection.  /s 

Like hearing a mall cop talk about how hard their beat is.
QS mooning, I hope it sticks. I need more $ for BABA leap calls!!
I bet he got calls
PLTR big green dicks at open , then manipulated 😡like clockwork 😡
Queen 👸
Someone is gunning INO. Calls at open?
Petition to change Baba ticker to Bagbag in memory of all the bag holders
> PLTR will RUN LIKE A TANK TODAY

ftfy
I was right - sweet 40% return in <30 days
China does not shy away from public displays of authority, but I’m sure the company was pushing the limits to increase profit behind closed doors. The public position is that alibaba is willing to do what the govt wants. In reality they don’t have a choice, people would be replaced long before breaking it up. Of course the current events won’t be good for alibaba, but this is exactly what to expect in this type of environment: a business is trying to increase profits, and the communist govt is openly trying to keep cost low for people as a “reminder” that the govt is “for the people.”

When judging this situation it’s important to remember that the the company executives are not free, and China can easily replace high ranking employees with loyal communist party members they want to reward whenever they want.

You could be seeing something I’m not, but it does not make sense to break up the company with all this considered, but I guess we will find out. Remember that alibaba exists as it does because China wants it to, and any news is because China wants that news.
Not helpful but this comment made me laugh
BABA: "Help me, help me!. Xi dick too big fo tiny ass!"
Nice
👅 the tip of my 🍆
$53.9B current market cap 🚀  + $900B stimulus 🚀  / 1.9B shares outstanding =  
PLTR to $502 🚀 🚀 Basic maths.
Vix is down and he hasn’t even tweeted today? You saying later today?
Help I invested in BABA this week and now this guy named margin keeps calling
🍏🙏✈😢
NIO is at a good level, and the BABA news will probably make it cheaper.
Agreed. They mess up the iced coffee 75% of the time to the point where it’s almost not drinkable too. I don’t know how they’re still in business with Krispy Kreme and Starbucks as competitors
Holy shit, baba really drilling to hades. Condolences baba holders
I dont even know what Cheddars is but good call
I never made money on Apple so fuck them and their shitty phones.
Buy stocks bro
Thanks for your kind words. Just hard to estimate the opening price for the calls. I will put a sell order for my buy price

this shit didnt age well
I can’t wait to watch GME get crushed.
Then cash out and take a break

Absolutely. Utilizing reverse psychology I know that when everyone does one thing, you always do the opposite.

Icln calls hedged with icln leaps
stock market being closed next few days gunna be shit.. Might have to play the christmas games .
Thnx💪🏻🚀🚀
Xi making an example out of alibaba.  He is putting jack ma back in line, reminding the local markey no company is greater than the party.  This will keep all other china companies inline for years to come.

Hope so, be the most I've ever lost on two shares in my entire life...
Yes, reliably expecting “just” 2% gains and reinvesting it all is a fine assumption. 280% returns if you compound 2% 52 times... nice.

Absolutely will not happen imo, the uncertainty and lack of preparation/information is what crashed the markets in March.

I’m retarded but even I can see the actual effects of the virus aren’t affecting the market, just policy and lockdowns. Even If Biden says we’ll have to go into years-long lockdown I don’t think it would look like March

Sometimes you can go a day and not buy anything guys
It’s a niche retailer with no future. Here’s why:

Is the TAM growing? Yes, but I can buy video games from anywhere. They have no most and no competitive advantage. Also, the reason for going to the store (exchanging used games) is dead. As such, they need to close almost of their physical stores and move mostly into online sales. I don’t see them competing with the big boys at scale with that model. Hence the massive revenue declines from the last few years.
I miss Trevor being CEO of NKLA. That guy was fucking entertaining with his bullshit claims.
Do you know the date of the merger by chance?

After its broken up maybe, they're obviously guilty of the things they're being accused of.
I've made over 1,000% gains on FCEL, sadly I'm a pussy and my original position was so small that my 1,000% gains are eclipsed by 5% gains on XLK
Would you do PMCC on spy and sell weeklies or buy CSPs?
I had the exact same thought.... but it turns out Chewy has had subscription boxes for over a year.  It’s called the “Goody Box”.  No one has ever fucking heard of it, and it’s a massive failure.

“All this said, I'm not concerned that these variants will significantly reduce vaccine efficacy in the 2021 rollout. Most circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses do not have any mutations in the spike receptor binding domain”

“However, we may see modest reductions in vaccine efficacy due to antigenic drift and will likely need a process in the coming years by which we update the spike variant used in the vaccine to best match circulating viruses.”

20 is the redemption price of the spac. Day 1 the units almost touched 21.

I think shares are probably good if you can get in under 25. Don't think we'll see 23 again. Warrants are overpriced right now.

Shares should damn well print but you'll have to be patient.
You should be holding shares or leaps and feel great about it.

Also keep in mind that MMs dont *have* to hedge, and even when they do - there are various ways to do so.

I agree with the Texas Roadhouse sentiment. Definitely the best lower cost steak chain restaurant!

The gift card is for Longhorns, Olive Garden, Cheddars, Bahama Breeze, Seasons 52, and Yardhouse. I can cook better steaks and make better Italian food. Maybe I’ll get Cheddars as I don’t know what the last three are at all.
So buy the BABA dip or what

There was a wall at mid 15s on Monday due to bearwhale protecting their 15p’s, broke through to wall at $20 on Tuesday where bearwhale rolled up to 20p’s, and Wednesday broke through to 22 screwing bearwhale even more. Whoever is on the other side of the puts the bearwhale keeps rolling up from 15 to 20 to now 24 is working hard to make sure they don’t print a penny. “The market can stay irrational longer than one can stay solvent” There are a lot of manipulative forces at play here, and it seems now that the balance has turned in favor of slaughtering the bears, aka GME is officially bullish (until it’s not)
I for one shall be watching with great interest as you manage to go -2000% on both because autists gonna go autistic

Question for OP? Does your brain hurt from writing this? Maybe you need to lay down and think a little harder. Short squeeze will 4x your money? You do realize that most shorts are not your average retail investor and buy calls otm to hedge?

Nice

Sir, this is a Wendy's.
Feels like it wants to go lower...
> OK, then educate me. How does an MM cover a put they sell?

When you sell a call you buy shares as hedge (so that if you get exercised - you'll have the shares to give up). A quick assumption is that if you sell a put (opposite of selling call) you short (opposite of long), which is wrong. You just have cash on hand to cover your put, that's all. Hedging means reducing your risk by somewhat reducing your max profit. 

So lets look at this assumption: we have sold a put:

 * Price goes up on expiry - we get the premium, everything went according to plan. 

 * Price goes down - we get assigned and buy shares at strike price (which is unfavorable for us). 

Max profit = whole premium. 

Max loss = strike price minus actual price (which is capped at zero).


Now let's say you have a bright idea of "hedging" with a short position

 * Price goes up on expiry - you're fucked on your short position. Infinite losses as there is no cap as for how high the price can go. 

 * Price goes down - yeah, you've limited your max loss (which already was capped at share price of $0) by profit from your short position cancelling your loss from sold puts.

Max profit = whole premium minus all the interest you've paid on your short position. 

Max loss = infinite


With shorting you've reduced your max profit while ramping up your max loss to infinity. And you could've achieved the same outcome without having infinite max losses by buying a put at a lower strike, basically by opening a credit put spread.

Here is a link on how to hedge sold puts: https://optionalpha.com/hedging-short-naked-puts-210369.html

> So, how do they get that cash?

Are you seriously asking where MMs, these entities with deep fucking pockets, get cash? And also assuming that the best way for them to get it is to short?

> What is that if not a massive short selling by MMs to cover those 62k puts they sold?!

So a stock rallies 46% in two days, then dumps a little and you can't see any reason for it? How about shorts doubling down, or new players shorting who still don't believe in the company, or people taking profits after this huge rally, or any bagholders who wanted an out? Any reason really, apart from a "hedge" that eats up your profits and blows up in your face instead of actually, you know, hedging
So they do black magic or something?
I’m starting to think meme stocks may be the only way to make money. Every stock I get into stays flat or immediately tanks. Nothing makes sense

I wouldnt rush into it. It wont have an immediate rebound and 90% of people hate the ccp. The stock might take a few hits between now and its recovery phase.

Inferring what's going on PM by scanning the stickied threads here is one of the best games to play. I do it every morning.
I’m switching now because I know when I switch to calls it’ll be the top. I know this because last time I went into calls it was MSFT 200c back in late January/early February

We should have a convention or at least a web show. WSB is really great, but this makes me want what Jordan Belfort had in Wolf of Wall Street, a real tribe of idiots in a physical location.
The Chinese government doesn't give a fuck about Baba's attractive position in the sector. Their goals are to stabilize their failing domestic financial system which Ant was making an mess of by pushing banks out of payments, lending and index investing. Ant and Baba had closer relationships to foreign banks than to domestic ones and now both are a threat. We all know what China gov does to preceived threats. They delete them.

Premed sucks. I took a few Neuroscience classes that had premeds in them and they were notably more annoying than my other classes cause they were filled with people who memorize everything on color coded index cards instead of problem solving (in general) and they were mega obsessed with the best possible GPA for medical school

Normal college classes were much better IMO

On the [TRADE tab](https://i.imgur.com/7HMPbMh.png) one of the collapsible menus is Trade Grid - Populate it with as many squares you want to keep tabs on and then click Maximize Cell for the stock you want to monitor, in this case PLTR.

Keep a hawk eye on the Ask/Bid lot sizes, an up move is usually preceded by an unusually large lot size (150+ BS) coming over the wires on Bid side.  Same with a down reversal, large lots will suddenly stuff the Ask and trigger downward sell pressure.  There's so much insane algo movement behind the scenes on this stock, only ever seen this behavior with Tesla.
Well if OP stated it, I fit into this sub, and my point that the reading comprehnsion makes me fear for my position still stands. 😁
Lmao yeah check out their News tab. They announce something on a company like every day.

TSLA rules. It proves again and again that they are the only EV company that walks their talk. Tesla 1000usd by end of Jan
Did you not see the other post? Let’s walk through it dumbass

Apple sells fewer computers than leading PC companies

Apple sells fewer phones than leading Android companies

Apple doesn’t sell a meaningful number of watches or AirPods to drastically effect their revenue

So yes my point is entirely valid considering Samsung and Huawei both ship more phones but Apple has higher margins so they’re worth more

Imagine trying to tell a former Apple employee that Apple isn’t a computer company because you missed the point entirely 🤡
The new meme stock is already here.

Yes and no. Perpetual licensing generally means they own the product with an option to pay a much smaller maintenance agreement to stay current. With a perpetual license they dont have to pay again contractually unless they want updates.

No. Palantir does not use AI or even machine learning. It just allows parsing of a ton of data in order to see connections. It also allows for  knowledge management and a collaborative spot to build on that data, among other things. Source - I've used it several times in SOF (and was underwhelmed by it).
I invested at the top. One bad decision doesn’t make you a bad investor. Don’t be a cuntie bitch
I’ll buy 2 today
You possibly have just made the best comment I've ever seen on reddit.
Every broker has tick by tick access, thats just visualizing Level 2 data essentially
My opinion is it's more volatile to buy in the AM as that's when the market is working out the direction it's heading. Other than that I'm comfortable buying anytime.

I can’t wait for the loss porn soon to follow.
SPY
Lol he said he bought $100 worth and now it’s worth $52
Imagine not remembering what happened on Christmas Eve 2018.
A fine ad for tradingview. Hope you got paid well for it.
Baba is safe.  Lots of chinese investment firms and pension fund own it. 

Baba and tencent are to retirement funds what housing is to canadians.
PLTR or PS5???

Give me the PLTR!!!
GME 23 eod get in while you can!
Pltr going to be 29 forever
Also, papa Karp says they are onboarding new customers in less than 2 hours now.
When you have a literal square block head you do dumb shit
I think you fell for that hedge fund manager end of year manipulation crap, steel ain’t going anywhere for a while, you might just as well hold. My take is that there will be a dip until the government announces infra modernization investments
Those and people with money care about it. It's not only the market who will decide if electric vehicles will succeed. Govt policies are also changing to enforce climate change conscious manufacturing. California is planning to ban sale of gas powered vehicles by 2035. UK by 2025. The average Joe will be forced to get an electric even if he doesn't give a shit about it
This why I don’t like to invest in Chinese companies. I screwed myself with LI and still holding that bag
Feels bad, best to project the worst case scenario before open and just come to terms with it, and then maybe, just maybe, it's not as bad. All about setting the expectations right.
yea it wasn't a lot of money I was just starting out gambling but it still hurts deep inside ;)
RemindMe! tomorrow
I WANTED  to say cash the fuck out over a month ago when it took some deep cuts after the steep run up, now I’m saying...TAKE THE FUCKING MONEY! Merry Fucking Christmas to you!

But not "right after" this post, prior to it it was pretty much flat. Check the timing :) Don't understand me wrong, I wish you guys good luck.

I would go for either the Steel gang, PLTR or gme! In that order
I sure know how to pick ‘em 🥡
Ticker symbol has been on the post title the whole time. They’re just downvoting so people don’t get confused as to what the ticker is.
ARKG and ARKQ for me.

What does this have to do with GME?

All my shares are deep in the green. I bought my first calls in a month yesterday on BABA. If thats not a sign that I should stop with options then what the fuck is.

Yeah but Ma invoked the ire of King Pooh. I bought in at 265 thinking that was surely the low point and at the bottom of multiple moving averages. Nope. Not even close. Bailed on my calls at a 30% loss, thank god I did because it's down another 12% since I sold.
I will.

Glad that BABA takes all of the attention today. Buy calls!

$IPOC calls on the dip.
I got it at like 11pm. Had dreams all night it went to $40 before I could buy.
Which call ?
You ain’t shillin hard enough son
lol check out MVIS, the engine behind the hololens. there tearing it up lately. im balls deep in 5.5 may and feb calls.
Who is getting into BABA next week?
Ive never bought an option before 🥺 how do I 🚀
You can build your career. They have what’s known in finance as a “depreciating asset”.
I would invest, I imagine they are profiting a ton from this sell off
and Cathie is life
You are absolutely right, but I would add that this also can be an advantage to palantír. Palantír is cool, simple to use and feels modern. I’m not even talking about the software itself but the brand, the perception. Seniors do decide about subjective intuitions and feelings sometimes and palantír to a firm sounds like a investing in a MacBook or iPhone to an individual. Most of the leaders would just choose palantír as THE data framework instead of paying for old and complicated things they don’t understand and need several weird nerds to get any results from.

Hey man, he made 5%!  Lay off him!  He mixed up the tea leaves with the wax from the green candles or something and read those and that's how he knew he will make 5% on every trade.  He just explained it.
I will never forget December 24, 2018. I was just approved for options and went all in on calls. 

We had one of the largest crashes in years that day. Ruined my first account that way.
And every spac I hold jumped 8-19% yesterday. Meaning he didn't pick the only winner yesterday, the entire spac market pumped hard

SPY pleas fly again
That's bad bro. Let me give you a more extreme example. 1 share has been sold for a total of $20. His saying there is no volume, you don't know the price until there is volume.
My BABA leaps that I bought when it dipped from 319 to 290 were down 50% as of yesterday. Probably down 75% in a few minutes...
I’m guessing it was ultimately paid for by tax payers, like our football stadiums?
once they satellite internet service is fully operational, he will have a huge cashflow from that.
I know that space x being private is not subject to the quarterly pressure, but once they open to the public, I'm going in.
yeah i guess that's true and i'm arguing for the way i think things should be rather than the way that they are.

and it seems hit or miss in the discussion threads. i got suspended once for making fun of the big thing at the DNC about biden's stutter but i've also gotten away with more blatantly political stuff so idk, seems like it's not as heavily moderated but you might get busted

Hilarious you think you have more money than boomers. The entire political apparatus has been setup to funnel money from the young to the old.

Eeeew that's disgusting!

Of course the nature of political debates depends on personality of participants, but there are certain human traits which are very predictable. 
Political discussions, especially when it’s about a polarizing person like Trump will lead to nowhere. 

Maybe you want to just understand their reasoning, but a vast majority of people initiate these debates to mock the other side and shame them for supporting an ideology they think is dangerous and causes real harm. 

Political posts are definitely allowed on discussion threads. Just saw a huge discussion ( read name-calling) about Trump veto of stimulus and spending bill.
Mate Jack is here for quick money. He isn't in for long run and I don't blame him. ATM he is about +15% since yesterday.

He gave us his pick, and many people followed to pump it $3 overnight.

Yes if you buy silver with your paycheck or trading profits and stuff it under your mattress, the taxman can't find it anymore.

alright you win, theres a little company i heard about that has lidar, and hologram hoes. maybe even a vertical to give bezos a boner.
It means current price action is meaningless so far, if about 1.000.000 shorts must cover today.

I was just trying to make a funny post, not shill anything, but ok.
Futures are green
Because he was meant to be in GME till $26 at least (x2-x10) and left around $21-22. But it's not because it will not get higher, but because it slowed down a bit.

He started yesterday (?) in STIC around $14.20, and said x2-x5. $17.40 currently.
Ha I love my broker... 7:30 am... might just cop some shares...
We call those pepperonis in this house.

Fuck same might nap though... got calls and puts on spy as a hedge and I need to figure out what stays and what goes.
OK, then educate me. How does an MM cover a put they sell?

We all know they need cash to cover it just in case that put does get exercised. So, how do they get that cash?

I'm willing to admit if I'm wrong, honestly, but you have to prove me I'm wrong first. Then I'll concede.

I will admit right away I don't know enough about options. So there, I gave you a hook, will you bite?!

One thing I observed yesterday though, in real time, is those 2 massive put buys that smacked GME's price down from almost-22 to low 21s and then mid 20s. What is that if not a massive short selling by MMs to cover those 62k puts they sold?!

Oh you’re going to assume I’m talking about Great Britain when I’m talking about England. You assume I don’t know basic geography instead of actually realizing I intentionally said England.

Scotland is part of Great Britain and they are firmly against Brexit and always have been so why would they be laughed at?

Wales and North Ireland clearly are not the ones in the driver’s seat of Brexit so they too don’t seem to be at blame.

That leaves England and especially David Cameron, Theresa May, Nigel Farage, and Boris Johnson who are **all** British as the ones we are laughing at

So learn to critically think before you assume other people don’t know the difference between England and Great Britain just to be a condescending asshole

I give your country the benefit of the doubt and you tell me I don’t know basic geography and I should blame Brexit on Wales 🤡

I strongly believe that BABA will long-term merely get a slap on the wrist as it is too important for the Chinese economy to fail. However I also believe, that this will drag on for quite a while. Would not recommend buying right now and if at all, stick with shares.

You’re crazy. So I’ll just say: username checks out.
I initially shorted the 40c, 35c, 30c, and now 28 (I was catching PLTR as it was falling to hedge my long position). The 28c but still has a ton of extrinsic value. Also, since my spread is set up properly, I don't mind (though may not *want)* hitting my max profit. Can easily just re-enter the position with new spreads (can widen or tighten as needed). 

On 1/8 if PLTR is still trading around $28 or so, I can most likely roll up and out for a credit, thus getting paid to wait a bit longer to collect more profit.

It can happen. Maybe even double down. If it hits 220 before January double down again. Use your retard powers to lower the cost basis for maximum gains when it goes to the moon. You will be able to buy 2 265 contracts for the price of your original call before this stops.

Regarding BABA, smart people DCA when the underlying dips ,(unless you think it can be delisted)
I feel bullish, they will probably slap him on the wrist eventually but there is a possibility of larger action so I dunno. 

I feel like having a small bullish position is smart after today.

When I saw it dropped yesterday after market I googled and this was first story that popped up I feel that [processing US stolen data for Chinese intelligence ](https://www.businessinsider.com/china-government-forces-chinese-companies-process-stolen-us-data-report-2020-12) is more concerning then the anti trust news bc the anti trust news was Kinda already out there by other actions the govt had done in last few months.   Isn’t this more trouble or a bigger case for delisting in the US?

I’m really wondering if the anti trust news was announced to eclipse this in the news cycle bc it seems to be the bigger news right now.

The only issue I see with that is that those are all low margin items for the retailer. It's not unusual for Walmart to sell a TV for less than they bought it for. The same goes for Target and Amazon.  

I imagine that's why GameStop has already started to expand their offerings into clothing and collectibles and such. if they want to increase profits further, they'll have to continue to expand into more and more categories.

He has more than $800 million just in Apple stocks alone, I think he got well over 100%+ gains just off of basic stocks since 2017 (EDIT: shit, just checked the chart, more like 200% gains lol).

I don't remember his Wells Fargo position, but he surely has at least $200 million more in that, even though he lost a lot of money on it so far...

He definitely earned a hefty chunk off of his GME positions, agreed, he's already 100% up, even with his most recent buys at $13-$16 range. But, his net worth was definitely above 1 billion before the GME saga.

Do not underestimate the power of the china anti monopoly law.  Dawn raids and the like have been commonplace and it is taken very seriously.   I would NOT be an investor here.   But there will be entry points and if you are a holder like OP ( nice DD ) I would continue to hold for the long term.    

This isn’t your typical meme stock for sure.

Disclosure:  long term in at $77.     Holding for another decade.
I saw r/FemaleDatingStrategy yesterday lol. They call guys Low Value Men. And it's not like their arnt shitty people out there but can you imagine if I was like hey guys my wife is developing a possible chronic illness and it has decreased her value a ton should I leave?

There is no use of talking about Winnie the Pooh. He is always power hungry and will be power hungry. This jokema made jokes on Chinese banks. The result is waking up Winnie the Pooh dark mode. They will push jokema hard such that no one will dare to make jokes on Chinese banks/ economy. Let’s see how low they will take BABA before showing kindness. 

PS: I don’t hold any position in BABA currently but I love to. IMO one of the most beaten down powerful company in the world right now. BABA literally owns many golden unicorns in south east Asia.
I'll check it out homie, thank you! I was going once a week for a while, but during covid I got scrambled and haven't made it back. Currently I've hit my deductible for the year though so it's all covered, I'll look into a PT though.

Will wait until day of expiry to roll my short strike. If PLTR has mooned by then, I would've captured max profits on this spread. I can hit max profit even if PLTR drops a bit, so I don't mind a bit of downside.

Amen brother.
Why should i buy STIC?
🙏
i'm kind of similar in that way i guess, i tend to play devil's advocate without really taking a stance or side, but i don't think people take me less seriously because of it. rather they tend to just ask questions rather than engaging. and then i look like an idiot because apparently i can't actually come up with an original thought, i can only argue with others
But seems like half the comments are saying: “I’m going long and holding on past whatever happens to the price tomorrow” and some are saying “it may hit 30+ tomorrow and then go back down”
Tell that to my gf. Our dogs have 30+ toys and are getting probably 20 more Christmas. I don't see an end in sight to all these damn dog toys.

They’re saying Becuase of potential news tomorrow (that some big whale is buying up a lot of the stock) or some one of company announcement, there’s a chance that tomorrow might make the stock shoot up momentarily very high. This will happen Becuase they need to offer a higher price for the stock so people are more likely to sell their shares if it’s being offered to the market above market price

Most people prefer to avoid discomfort. That’s why you see people stick to dead end jobs for years or stay in a soul sucking relationship. It’s easier than exposing yourself to the churn
That’s reassuring 🙏
Same. But now I have a reputation of being devil's advocate and it's hard to get people to take me seriously.
The underlying specifics can be a littke tricky to grasp, but the overall concept is not too hard and should give you a fundamental understanding of the business.

So, for ages business, governments and institutions have been collecting information about people. Sometimes with specific uses in mind and sometimes just to have the data. If the data is properly maintained and ordered correctly (think like columns properly labeled on an excel sheet)  then this would be called structured data and this is then used by analysts to improve decision making by giving information and trends to those in charge.

However, if the data is not ordered correctly and just in a heap somewhere (think like an excel sheet with just random columns of information not sorted whatsoever) this is what is called unstructured data. Traditionally, you would a large team of analysts and data scientists to come up with algorithms and programs to make sense of this information and actually make it usable to these institutions to gain insights and help their decision making. However what palantir is able to do is just add a layer between the business and this unstructured data and just completely structure it straight away. We're talking hundreds of hours saves and way way less people.

What I didnt realise and learned from this video, and i could be mistaken, is that it's able to join multiple databases together and ensure they collaborate correctly. So if we had three sets of data that are competely different to each other and not even connected but are all about the same topic e.g three different hospitals have collected information about heart disease but all in three different unstructured fornats, palantir can go in extremely quickly and just make sense of that data for you without the painstaking effort and time of getting a team to manually sort it. Now instead of three hospitals, think every single hospital in america! 

Add in the fact, that they make bespoken and customised platforms for businesses to make sure its algorithm is extremely relevant to their needs and you can see why it's an easy extremely valuable tool.

The best comparison I can give is, ages ago a large team of coders was needed to make a standard website and they did it all manually through html and css code (if you're not techy, just think green screen text from matrix, but not as advanced ). Now we have things like wordpress and square which means non-programmers can just drag and drop templates onto a website and make a very nice and good looking website in minutes. This is like that, except for data sets and analytics. What used to take ages, could take seconds  with palantir and could be done by non technical people. Analytics is the future, so this is extremely valuable and impressive!
It took 6 months to see my thesis validated ain't nobody got time for that.

“However, we may see modest reductions in vaccine efficacy due to antigenic drift and will likely need a process in the coming years by which we update the spike variant used in the vaccine to best match circulating viruses.”

Found the pajeet.
Just happened for me a couple days ago after being locked all year. Been playing with the less than $100 in my account and made $12 on a $50 RAD call just to prove to myself I can do better than I used to before I transfer in the $1000 I've got coming to invest. Be careful friend, "slow and steady" wins the race (but really, accepting 20% gains overnight instead of constantly chasing ten-baggers is still fucking fast not quite "slow and steady")

Apparently you haven’t done your research. There isn’t going to be a pullback we’re at day 13 mofos have to settle and buy. I’m going in for today’s day trade
It's not a growth stock!!!

This seems like a lot of confidence for a company that most recently grew only 12% year over year.

I know the headline ran with 62% growth and some of the financial sites show that 62% as well. But from their own quarterly press release, that is not the actual growth rate. 

Magnite revenue was $61.0 million for Q3 2020, up 62% from Q3 2019 on an as reported basis and up 12% on a pro-forma basis

Third quarter 2020 financial results of Magnite represent the combined performance of Rubicon Project and Telaria, which merged on April 1, 2020. Third quarter 2019 comparative numbers do not include results from Telaria, unless noted as pro-forma.

Telaria was around a $15M/quarter company. So the 62% doesn’t take into account nearly 25% of the combined company total revenue into the comparable. And when you look at the comparable it’s only 12% growth for the combined company. 

Further the mobile and desktop grew about 3% YoY. And CTV accounted for $11M and 18% of revenue and grew at 51%. At $11M that should be growing near triple digits to be anywhere near matching the narrative. $11M and 51% are pathetically small numbers for what should be a hypergrowth market. And that CTV growth rate has fallen like a rock every quarter.

The guidance is similarly weak at $75M at top of guide. The Q4 combined comparable is $68.1M, implying 10-11% growth. Q4 is a seasonally larger quarter for both of the Magnite companies. As typical you can expect Q1 guide to show a decline QoQ. And probably continued 10-12% growth.

Annual Revenues from the past few years:

2016: 278M
2017:155M -44% YoY
2018:124M -20% YoY
2019: 156M +26% YoY


This is clearly a "hope for a turnaround" company and not a high growth company!!!

I’m bad at math, I knew it was over 10, I then checked between vanguard and robinhood and thought it was over 15, but I think I added it wrong. It’s in between 10 and 15. 9600 robinhood but the vanguard portion I was looking at wrong, that wasn’t a gain over the past two days. So I started manually trying to calculate it over each day, but I’m tired, i just know it’s over 10 combined. So I edited it back to 10+. The gains has very little to do with my post.
So... YOLO STIC? Just say yes and I do it.

Found out a blow job wasn’t really blowing it was sucking? Raped the fuck out of the vacuum cleaner. Mom didn’t understand why the filters constantly clogged. Ended up getting one of those in home systems... now I just fuck the wall.  I have no idea what happens to it now I guess it just magically goes away.

Good christ why not take a lower strike way closer?  You're asking a stock to nearly double again, in just 2 months time, and only then will you be nearing your break even.  I'd roll that out on a day like today and move to something with a more realistic shot

Related-ish, but not the whole story. A lot of MSFT’s problems were intrinsic and environmental. MSFT was trading near current-day AMZN valuations in the late 90s (which was unthinkable at the time). MSFT got hit by antitrust in 1998, before and after which it actually had a very strong run up (investor excitement @ OP’s point #6). So the stagnation for MSFT was due in part to the dot com bubble bursting in 2000-2002 and it was after this that it largely fell into stagnation. But recall that it was also joined by much of the tech sector and other leading tech companies at the time — because during the bull run in the late 90s, for tech companies and MSFT especially, investors had prepaid for too many years of  future growth and it took forever for earnings to catch up. So I think your argument is much more applicable for antitrust cases like AMZN actually given its P/E (120~) than BABA, whose P/E (20~) is already below average and quite attractive for its sector today (even accounting for the possibility of lower growth on the horizon, which I doubt).

No, you're correct. The 'risk' in selling a covered call is the risk of giving up more possible profits if the stock moons. Excluding that, there's no way to get screwed (selling the call itself - this is also assuming you're ok holding shares of whatever it is, which you should be, because the other risk is obviously that the stonks go down )

Sorry to hear
Sell fuckers a data management software program. Aka mailbox money reoccurring money managing your data while trying to extract information aka identify trends in your data. Like if you were a vet it would identify what’s the age of your average pet you see along with how much money do your clients spend on average. Based upon this data you might consider starting to sell some new service based on this data. They help you manage this data and find these trends you don’t even know that are occurring.
I went all in two days ago
Big PP if Big PP
It’s not too late to get on the Triterras bandwagon.  Merry Christmas!
I'd give anything to go back to early March and replay everything again and fix my massive mistake which was buying TSLA puts. I'd be a god damn millionaire right now had I just bought calls instead
Shill would imply I know what I'm talking about.
Thanks for the post. My wife is a beautiful person inside and out, I just don’t like to talk about my mental issues with her. I try my best to make her happy during the day and then stay up all night feeling depressed.
Alt strategy: go long on quality stocks and forget about it, see you in a couple years

Make that for 80-90% of your money and you can yolo the rest
...and probably collateral damage from incoming removal of some Chinese tickers for having connections with Chinese military.
$AAPL is EV stock now. 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
with that attitude youll never make 4k in a week lol

It sucks, been thinking about putting money into a broker like tastytrade to get options access but if I do it'll probably be a 10% loss by default at the rate the dollar is tanking. Then again I have been trading us stocks so I'm allready taking the loss anyway, and getting double fked because my local broker charges like 8 dollars a trade so.....
Can you shill me on EVER
Yes.  stop counting cards
Set for life... I wouldn’t be even posting shit, I’d be like “fuck, finally I’m rich”. Reddit would be the last thing on my mind
exactly give it a few months before people start selling their Tesla shares to pay the rent
the sentiment in the market, from what I am seeing, is people seem to just be buying and hold...and buying more without realizing any profits.

the issue with this is, not everyone will be able to exact the same profit and someone will be left holding the bag once people start unloading shares.

Question is, what will trigger that?
whys that?
Fuck you, the random Kazakh financial firm I've been dumping my money into doesn't *need* "research" to be trustworthy
I am not touching that chinese shiet anymore, I am leave 15 260 mar fuking calls that cost me more than 14k! Not avg down, not selling

GBP is historically very weak... after Brexit it could strengthen a heck of a lot more than this, watch out
They may sell insurance, but their growth will be in their "Agent platform" very similar to Zillow selling different tiers of Leads to agents.
Good thing I start buying around August, if you had EUR or GBP exchanged to USD at the beginning of the year and you're already not doing hot on the returns.... GUH

PLTR it's time to fly once again
Yeah if Tech could dump that would be great. Also if you guys could have those TPS report on my desk by the end of the day that would also be great.
Y’all remember back a few months ago when ENPH was being investigated? Lol we had puts printing and shit and it drilled to $35, then fucking overnight all the mfers bought the dip and it opened up like 6% next day and wiped out all gains.

HOLY FUCK when did ENPH hit $180? Wtf I just checked for the first time in a while.
Not really.
Hey, calls may be the play at open. Might buy some fd lottos for the fuck of it
There's a bot for that, I'd look it up but I can't read

When is solar week on retardstreetbets?
I was homeless and Robinhood literally stole my big short trade back in February (like by "stole" I mean they just took my shit, like "nice position, thanks for paying for it, we'll take that now") and then locked my account and it took me until now to get my account unlocked. Also never got my stimulus check. All you fucks who made money shorting the market, got your stimulus checks, etc. deserve to lose, I can't wait to take all your moneys from all of you now that my account is back and I finally have enough money for other accounts on better brokers soon

You might be missing the being active, or the competition, or the people. Try to find ways to get more of all three in this weird situation in which we temporarily find ourselves.

It might be worth turning down the risk in your investments for a while. If you're taking enough risk to make 10k in two days, yet you're depressed and anxious and turning to alcohol for help (by the way, that's not a good idea) there might be a connection.

You're lucky to have a wife. You can find joy in making her happy, and you can ask her for help when you need it. Your job is to make her life better and easier, to help her be the best person she can be, and to help her have the best life she can have. That's her job for you too though, so let her know that you're having a hard time and she will step into her role of trying to fix things the same way you'd step up to fix things if she needed your help.

Life's got a lot of us fucked up right now, but if we keep helping one another and asking for help when we need it we'll be good.

They also said no sales or revenue for 5 years lmao

U only lose money when you sale
I never see anyone mention ENPH. Shits basically a 2nd tesla. I remember trading it at $30 last year. Damn.
Get in $EVER tody. Gonna be a repeat of LMND.
She thinks I will die on a motorcycle because I’ve had bad luck with car accidents. Been in about 5 of them. The last one was really bad, I had head trauma and some of my depression and anxiety onset after that. I got about 93 grand settlement after paying off the doctors. 100k insurance policy.

Hmm, gonna need to find a bigger stick to poke it with then.
Good advice, but I question "Never hold through earnings".  This would mean you never hold a stock more than a quarter, and as such, would always pay short term capital gains instead of long term capitals gains on any profits.
Yea I hate that, it stops on PC too.

Approved
You put more thought and energy into this one post that 99% of people put in to their life savings
Volatility look more useful to me right now than waiting for TSLA to break a new high like I usually did. An ancient gaming retailer is a weird choice though, but money doesn't care. Will buy the next 15% dip.

Edit:  I wasn’t going to do it but can’t resist.  I haven’t quarantined whatsoever this entire time.  I’ve seen all my friends flown a bunch of places in the world for dirt cheap and it’s been incredible.  So many National parks and zero crowds!  So I just want to thank absolute sheep, I mean people, such as yourself that kept this country locked up for an entire year!  Also would like to inform you I just flew back from a “World Cup” style event from my sport... 5000 people there from countries all over the world and not a single mask in sight! (USA! USA!). It was an absolute blast.  So again, thank you to all of you HEROES that stayed inside you did your part!  Anyway I have to go pack for my trip to Colombia now that I bought a round trip for $150.  Remember to wear your mask and stay inside!  I’m sure the virus just hasn’t caught up to me yet....

this is not only bad advice for stonks but also bad advise for gambling!
2.5% is juicy. Safer to buy dips with that (22 of 25) might be 27 is new dip
No. China has announced it wants more oversight over their companies. They won't stop at some small antitrust, they want total control.

Investing in China is including the risk that this party policy become a reality. Too much of a risk for me.
Oh no. I just got back from getting T/O from subway on base here in Germany and the guys behind me were talking about PLUG, LAZR, and QS. This is literally the top.

I see a psychiatrist and a psychologist. We talk about shit, try different meds, we figured out Xanax helps me with anxiety, but the depression is trickier. Trying to do things I love but it’s so hard with covid.

Unfortunately so many of the antidepressants I’ve tried I fucking hate.

Bro im just trynna feed my family
Btw when I have More cash I’ll be buying those boxes for my dogs.
I take xanax, trazodone, gabapentin.

I was on anti depressants like tintrillex and welbutrin but they really didn’t make me feel good and fucked up my sex drive. 

Xanax helps me a lot. Trazodone helps insomnia. I’ve yet to find anything to help the depression.

I've been tricked by dips from this forsaken company so many times...
290.
280
270
260
I've seen and bought em all...
Top is in
Which is the best stock dip to buy right now in pre market
large if factual.
Baba on sale bitches
My day FOMO in, Chicken out. Result: lose a lot of money.

Anyone know of performance enhancing drugs to supress these feelings?
“Buy the dip”
I rather you share the third
Talk to u/cpttonystark about that. 

Try new things. Talk to a therapist. Write your feelings in a journal. Count your blessings. Not just the big things, but the little things as well.
Is the stock market also going to acknowledge the morning after New Years and open at 1 PM?
Name checks out
Imagine doubling down (again) on BABA yesterday.   
Could not have been me 🤡
Low energy too...
Honestly, some realtors just blow. Zillow has a good estimate of value but just depends on when you list. Realtors almost always suck unless you get one of the top agents or brokers, and then still you have to dangle the commission from the new house you’re buying (if possible) to get a good deal on em. It’s ridiculous. 

the House has market value of $385K. 

Open door says they will buy it for $365K and take 7.5% of that as their “fee”. 

Meanwhile, a realtor would work to list the house at $385K and then try to get you to take the first offer at that price. So you’ll bet $361K after realtor fees or $337.5K with open door. 

Meanwhile OPEN can turn around, slapstick paint job the house and list it for $385K and settle at $380K or whatever, and since they are a realtor, only pay ~3% of the realtor fees. This nets OPEN $27.5k for the 7.5% fee, plus an additional $31.3K potential for selling the house at market after taking out buyers agent fees for almost $59K in profit on one house. 

It’s a fucking sham.

I was cringing so hard at the "diamond hand gang" holding onto their SPY puts in April when the market started to recover big time
well, i have gain from other stuff and can sell it to "save" around 1k tax
No one knows, long term definitely a yes.
Wake up boys shitty Chinese stocks are getting delisted. Ban this man for cutting into our beauty rest
Nope I just see bitch hands like you a dime a dozen posting dumbass shit like can anyone confirm GME PM.  Of course people can see it bro what the fuck do you think this is
YOLO on short term BABA puts?
这样我的世界也可以理解自己为什么
Just to counter, they have zero reason to release technicals. They have enough money from vw and their spac deal to scale up without having to convince anyone publicly of anything. I doubt they're in a hurry to tell their competitors exactly what they've done because if they really can be the first to get there 50bil market cap is gonna be peanuts.
Jack Ma is fine, we are fuked
Thanks, can’t wait for the vaccine and for sports to come back for us!
So a rope walks into a bar and the bartender seeing him says "get out, we don't serve your kind in here!" The rope walks out and starts to untangle its fibers and ties itself into a loop, it walks back in and the bartender says "aren't you the rope I just kicked out a minute ago?" The rope looks at him and replies "I'm a frayed knot"
fucking legend.
I am not afraid to lose the money I put in, I am afraid to lose more money that I put in.
I don't expect DD to already crash this soon. premiums are so insane on puts the sellers will want to keep the stock up for a while :)

I mean, There is not point selling them right now, shiet basically wortless!

I'd wait for this dip to recover a bit and then sell at the loss. I'd say that's the best choice given the odds

But, you do you. It's easy to suggest selling when it's not your own positions.
Is that to avoid tax?
Outside of the stock market, the world is fucked and getting worse. Plenty of legitimate reasons to feel this way.

I'm actually really scared for a market crash, and not because I will lose money, but because stonks are the one bright light left in this world. This world is kept alive on printer ink right now.

Keep pushing along though, you will find something that makes you happy again eventually. Right now is just a dark time.

It’s fucking 5:30 am market doesn’t open for 4 hours and you are asking about PM and if anyone can confirm as if it fucking matters.  You are the worst type of trader and it’s fucking clear you know nothing and are a panic handed bitch.  If you were solidified in your position and didn’t buy at the top you wouldn’t be up 4 hours before the market opens panicking.  Have a great day panicking you fucking hack.

My stock was up 10% PM and closed -2%.  What does your hacky ass, unfounded approach think about that?  Would you have been excited to see GME up 10% and think your god?  Cause it means nothing.  It only means something to absolute retards like you that buy or sell based on it.  Man I see many bad plays coming your way new Robinhood trader.  God speed man!

Sell then instead of saying a bunch of shit we don’t care about. We only care about 🚀
China is an authoritarian technocracy, wrapped nicely around a long dead communist ideology. The CCPs legitimacy is upheld as long as they enable economic growth and financial prosperity for the Chinese people, which is a bit of a double edged sword for the CCP. Ideally the economic reforms China has gone through over the last 30/40 years translate in political reforms, but that ain’t fucking happening

The Trump China relationship has been rocky AF. Whilst Biden will be less 'free-market' on it, I think he'll aim to stabilise that trade relationship clean up the tarriffs etc.

The only issue is if he doesn't want to seem too soft on China so, whilst doing the above, makes a big headline play to assert dominance, that inadvertently fucks Baba

It’s super early you all are so ridiculous for thinking this means anything . Realize you honestly know fucking nothing then understand what assumptions you are making based off data you don’t even understand.
You‘re stating your fear. And you want an answer for a question that you didn‘t ask....

This post is useless

And if you have fear already, don‘t even start. You shouldn‘t have any feelings when investing, you‘re just gonna loose with fear.

Cut down on eating so much pussy. Shit, wrong sub
Would you stfu
For one second the stock stops rocketing going up and people like you ask what’s going on.. Christ man act like you’ve had a win before and just enjoy the ride.  Or sell now and shut the fuck up as it keeps going.  Don’t be a panic bitch
We should have someone who records confirmed donations from this subs activity and then try and beat it YoY.
What makes you happy? For example, it’s traveling for me... maybe try pursuing or taking some free time to do something that makes you excited. Or maybe see a therapist
if anyone bought that call why would they call it at 460 before the expiry date? do you mean something RH specific like RH tries to buy it back when too much $ was lost?

legit never been margin called but if I bought that call the only way I exercise it instead of selling, is if I want still holding it for some reason after hours
If he sells cash secured puts and it's delisted, he keeps the premium. It's a win.

The only issue would be if we know it will be delisted so it tanks like 99% and OP is then forced on the put.

That’s what I was thinking. Outwith all this Jack Ma nonsense it’s an  absolute beast of a company with off the charts revenue. Tempting

I made a lot of money in the past two days, over 10 grand, but I’m not even happy. What’s wrong with me. 

I just feel hollow and depressed and anxious like I was gonna have a heart attack. I took some Xanax and drank some beer and I’m hoping I just knock out.

What the fuck is wrong with me.

I should be happy about Christmas, my  wife, my new house, and my recent wins. But I’m not right now. I’m just hollow.

How do you be happy? Advice needed.

See I think it's possible that there is some massiv liability that all of us idiotic retail bulls have missed. Some big pension fund to pay out, or some lawsuite because Gamestop stores used to be center of an child sex ring in the ninties or something like that.

Imagine I bought baba put yesterday 💦💦💦💦💦
Remember xmas 2 years ago were we were near the bottom of a massive dip cause by Jpow raising rates. Good times
was it just some random comment on the daily discussion? where did u find this gem
Nah don’t bring us into this shit y’all did it to yourselves
Who upvotes the daily thread?
China ruined my Christmas
yep.. learned not to listen to wsb. fyi, if you look at Tesla's hourly, big head and shoulders, i'd watch out.. unless it can get above 660, otherwise looks like back to 627 and if that (neckline) breaks , 600 or lower.
You can also loose 100x on options
The dudes motivation was stupid as fuck
Exactly. Id still rather invest in BA when it was very questionable.  Although I do have big positions in both lol
[deleted]
Anyone cleverer  than me..TLDR is Baba a buy at this point?
BABA boys. Just remember this pain is temporary. The friendships we’ve made along the way are forever!
I'm a long hold on this. Already up 50% on shares so got the flexibility to weather a storm.

I don't see any realistic way for this company not to keep growing, and fast. As OP said, undervalued due to lack of knowledge from Boomers and the fact it isn't a Western based business.

They also do a fair bit in the AI space, which is a huge growth area as we know.

If you're even in the top 20 retailers in China alone, that's huge.
Was a 🌈🐻 and shorted BABA this week. No one bought my contract yesterday but I bet they will now
When looking at sma in tradingview what kinda time perspective do you use? Because it changes based on the time fram you use doesn't it\`?
They have private business and strive for communism. Communism is a process. It isn’t instant, can’t just eliminate capitalism immediately and expect it to work well. 
They currently don’t exemplify communism well. They just call themselves it. They have aspects of it though. 
Cuba is more communist than China

So when do you plan on jumping off the SPIC train and back onto the GME ship?
I like to buy and hold stocks but never know when to comfortably exit.  For example I have stocks that I feel will 2x in a year.  Well let's say they 2x, at that point I would exit... but should I? At that point now I'll feel like... well I was so right about this great company... it will probably 2x again in a year.  I don't know, I'm never confident in when to exit.  GME is good one... like when the f do I hop off.
The only time I was a 🌈🐻 is shorting BABA this week, too risky to continue. Will YOLO some PLUG and GME calls
we moon at dawn bitches
Alright fess up. Which one of you bastards asked Santa for sub drama for Christmas?
So as long as you trade US based options you just pay 1%. It's OP as fuck...

Arguably it has been much easier for IPO stocks to reach those levels because those who got allocations can simply dump and people like to buy shiny new things at very inflated prices. If DASH had been public for many years I doubt it would ever reach that level. Thus, I believe it will be a bit harder to convince people to buy into GME, let alone drive it to multi-ten-billion market cap, but my fingers are crossed
Thanks the DD. Could you provide „source A“?
Good morning and welcome to Gyna’s mad at BABA and wants to destroy the company

As a chemist who has studied next-gen batteries at NASA (somehow even though I can’t read), I’m with you on this. QS looks fantastic, but it takes a long time to scale up batteries from the lab. Also there are a very large number of battery chemistries coming off the lab bench right now and it’s hard to know which ones will be able to scale up to a commercial product. It’s going to take QS a long time to catch up their current stock value.

Having a physical disk is ultimately better than having only digital copy, as you don't rely on downloading whole game making you wait hours. If they are priced the same there is absolutely no point of getting digital unless you live in a box and have no space to keep DVDs. On top of that you can sell physical copy once you're done with it for small return, and there is no such possibility with digital.

GameStop may not work for pc games, but it definitely works for pc hardware. On top of whole consoles world and the rest of things GameStop offers and will offer once RC will start implementing his vision.

TLDR: dump everything?! 🤔🤔🤔
Too many macro risks for me right now. ANT will probably IPO in early 2022 after regulation has been figured out and they can build in the necessary features / reporting. Until that stuff has been figured out (+ risk of trump aggressively trying to delist more chinese companies before he is OOO), I think there are better plays. But if your time horizon is long enough, this is a decent entry point for shares.
I lost 50% of my portfolio in vxx calls. Never again for me lol.
It never opened for premarket.  Normally happens at 2am
This is me right now dude. Idk I took some shit to help me sleep and it’s not working but def gonna make it harder for me to get up at the opening bell tm and that’s literally all I care about rn

where the fuck is the new thread? did zjz control that too? fuck
I truly wish you good luck.

I don't have your retard strength though. One thing you do contribute to is, with each call option, you force the MMs to buy/own 100 shares to cover/hedge, so in a way, you're actually helping me and every other long out here.

they should have a reverse holiday, where instead of the market being closed, its open 24 hours. maybe a whole week straight festival?

It's a half day in the market today, so it's likely going to be a boring day. After that the market is closed on Friday, so nothing of note will probably happen until Monday
I would average down at 230 then u would break even by Q1 2021.
$800 would be at the market cap of door dash Which they’re literally one announcement away from being the same company but with an actually viable business model
I make barely over that and I certainly live paycheck to paycheck. I have a massive life insurance for my kids and I spend/live like there’s no tomorrow.

I also hold property as my emergency collateral if shit goes south
Can't go tits up brother 🚀
250 seemed like a sturdy rail for BABA. I leaned on it, it broke off, and I fell into the chasm
Yeah you right people were saying it wasn't. Not sure if that was true but yeah now it looks like it's there.

Tldr from all the DDs on here:

- Cohen is looking to take over the company, has lawyers on retainer who have already dealt with GME recently and won.

- He Wants to transition Gamestop to e commerce for all things electronics, drones, games, phones, etc.

- Plans to use gamestops brick and mortor stores as hubs to have near instant delivery times using courier services. Need a pc part? Order it from gamestop and Doordash will have it to your house within the hour.

- Brick and mortor stores will still he buy back centers but for all things electronic, not just disk games and consoles. Tablets, drones, pc parts and such could be returned to gamestop for credit. 


- When you combine all of that gamestop becomes the middle man between Amazon and Ebay. Want to buy something refurbished, delivered near instantly, from a reliable vendor? No one else could compete in that market. And there's a huge market for used electronics.


That's why GME is going to the moon 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

TA is actually kind of useful considering that SPY hasn't been able to break either the 370 resistance line or go below 366 support. Honestly, if it breaks, then we may see a 2% day in either direction. 1 pm should be fun
I always thought the best way to use stop losses is set them everyday after the first 30mins of trading. But what am I talking about I don't use em anyways

Lol no. If the Chinese decide to fight against their big companies that just means US companies can swoop in. Not in China, but stuff like AliPay is fairly popular in the rest of Asia for example.

This would be a great chance for US companies.
I did some big math today for myself and counted that if I had 2mil with 3% yearly return, it would bring me 60k a year (i didn't include taxes because I'm not smart) and i was like - nice.
This guy here has 3mil on GME alone... I am jealous
Right because 600 bucks is really gonna stave off eviction
Create on some platform e.g. Wordpress where you can limit people to read/write or just read-only (or can you already do this with subreddits idk).

That means people can join easily and see the content, but can't just start posting anything until they've been approved to post stuff.  I'd be happy losing ability to post on WSBv2 if it means the stuff I read is overall better quality.

Everyone needs that getting scammed by China experience tbh.

It makes you appreciate US stocks and the security of waking up with the company still existing, the books not completely cooked and the CEO not being disappeared.

Hope you didn't lose too much.
If the squeeze does start to happen, buy those covered calls back however you can. It'll hurt spending that money right now, but you won't miss out on $80+ per share gains.

>present some superb plan to make GameStop Amazon for gamers, cosplayers, collectors, and your local esport hub, with some other superb offers only young visionary 

I feel like this is the crux. I'm not really sure what GameStop can do, their current business model of going into the store and trading in games peaked in the 2000s. But post-pandemic world where you can just download a game from your couch, what could Gamestop possibly offer that would be compelling enough to have people drive to a store and buy a product, when they could download it from their couch?

I'm holding some GME right now as a meme play, but I don't really understand the bull case for $40+

It's amazing how they see any small amount of buying by an ARK fund to maintain fund balance as a result of new capital inflow as some sort of positive message from the heavens to pump.
the fine is 80k USD..
Idk if we should be placing faith in corporations to do what’s right for humanity lol.

He is actually right on that. Buy options with an expiration date after earnings but sell before. Usually the stock will have a decent run up the week before and you can also capitalize on increased IV.
You use the penny tray, right?
Stfu
So BABA down bigly, but JD down as well. They should profit from the noise around BABA right, or are the BABA investigation a thread to the entire chinese ecommerce?

I thought BABA gets fucked b/c Jack Ma was not nice to CCP
Bro, come on, I think that’s enough now
That would be confirmation that we live in a simulation.
No. Get you fxkin expenses under control!
strangely they only have itm calls lol i guess some new strikes will drop down later

so in this strategy one would do a roth ira so the taxes are taken up front but not on the gains, correct? So OP turns let's say 100k to 2 million, he is not taxed on the 1.9 million. Is that what you are saying?

I NEVER go full cash gang but might take at least some of my cash off the market tomorrow yeah
I don't doubt that at all, there's many more who are rolling in GME tendies last 2 days.

Here's a counter question. Who's to say it **WILL** happen again, huh?

You know nothing more or less than I do.

It's a guess.

It's a gamble.

And yes, this is a casino, so gamble the fuck away if you want.

I'm gonna boomer my way with boring shares in the meantime. I'm almost guaranteed a 2x eventually, maybe even very soon, and it looks like odds are on my side to land somewhere in 3x-10x range.

I feel this. Sold 6x 12/29 CCs at $15 a couple weeks back to cover my dip. I bought 400 shares after more just so I wasn’t just making money for someone else the whole next month.

Sure, I’ve never been on a discord before but I am generally also friendly and just chill lol
but this isn't market manipulation bc op beieves in this ticker and has listed the reasoning. Plus op has a good track record. Market manipulation is what Godlman Sachs does when they lie about a price target so that ppl follow their directions  - stock is too high for example they might say and then when it goes down, Goldman buys it.

Did you buy shares on STIC? I'm debating

got out my options for small gain some time ago, just have shares left. Dont really care about the price bc will be up in long time. Just shitty to baghold and be 5% less liquid.
Also don't day trade it's fucking retarded and most of you are gonna lose money
The stock market kinda proves the rich get richer tho. Like we see success stories on WSB of people yeeting 10K, turning it into 50K, then yeeting that 50K and turning it into 100K, etc. but the vast majority of the market is people with large principles they don’t need to touch letting that money grow.
That's a volume of 300 shares lol.
Nah, calls are free money

I swear if the GME squeeze actually happens today I'm raging. Can't trade with my shitty ass broker today and won't be able to sell. So let's pray it happens after christmas

I joined GME gang yesterday. No, mostly single stock shares in PLTR (bought at 9.97, sold at $24), NIO (60%), ROKU (40%), and some small call positions in ICLN, TAN, PLTR, and MSFT. Bought like $1000 of FCEL the other day and it’s now $1400 or so. Pretty pleased. I try to keep option exposure low and when I win there I roll profits into shares. The -56% came from putting all my gains back into YOLO calls lol. Learned to diversify and roll profits into adding shares to lock in profits and sustain longer term more stable growth

Also spreads instead of single long calls. So much less downside risk. If the market crashes you won’t blow up your account but the leverage still boosts your gains nicely
>Alibaba’s Hong Kong stock dropped 8.1% to 228.20 Hong Kong dollars, its lowest point since July, in a shortened pre-Christmas trading session. The decline means Alibaba has now fallen more than 25% since a late October peak, when it was riding high ahead of a planned blockbuster listing of its financial-technology affiliate, Ant Group.

He could've used a boomerang tactic with his lightsaber and it would've been a done deal. I know it was for theatrics, but the guy with the Intel drive literally was "running" slow as possible and was screaming "please, please let this Sithlord kill me!"
ALSO! Vader is standing in the vaccum of space with his Cape waving in the solar winds.....

There is NO force user ever (other than Abelothe and "maybe"...possibly the other 3 immortals) that can survive the vacuum of space. It's like Leia being thrown into space itself, dead for 10minutes and force pushing her lifeless, completely cosmically frozen (Blood & all, lungs & heat literally bursted and shattered) back to the ship...
Ok Rant over

Market manipulation is a thing lmao. Nothing will likely come of it, but if a bunch of retards online pump a stock 20% overnight they start getting curious
Can you please fucking go green tsla thanks. 

I was expecting a wayyy harder drop on BABA than a 7%
so we can all agree that mon will be the most bullish day of this year right?
meme ones, but not NIO or PLTR which have lost their momentum. Do something that’s been super hot recently (like last week or two) and try to ride the wave
Autism
This is really the simplest way to explain the bullish thesis around this stock. Even if the revenue drops all the way down to 3 billion next year (is that even possible during the peak of the console cycle?!), GameStop is likely to be profitable, maybe even by a considerable margin.

And we all know what happens when that happens. The chart doesn't lie, and Wall Street is still the same - they can't look farther than 12 months away from their stupid fucking noses, so this stock will moon and moon hard after they see a company whose revenue is 2-4 times larger than its market capitalization, which is practically impossible to find nowadays!

I mean, fucking PLTR has 1 billion revenue and 1.1 billion LOSSES (that means they earn 1 billion and spend 2.1 billion, for you retards) and it has 50+ billion market cap. At their current growth rate, it will take 10-15 years for that company's real value to reach market value ffs...
That makes me feel better 🤡
Might just stick my fingers up there for now

In order to remove shares from available to short, you must buy in cash accounts. Such as IRA. Or if your account doesn’t have margin. 

Shares in margin accounts are automatically available to brokerage companies for lending to short sellers and without your knowledge 

If you buy in cash accounts, nobody can make them available to be borrowed for shorting without signing a lending agreement with you. 

That’s why, you must buy in cash accounts to force shorts to cover because of failure to deliver.
Plenty of time for that when you're rich right?
Wow the mouse is on the move let’s gooooo
How about NGA thats merging w lion electric? Some all star canadians from a power company are merging to form a canadian ev company. Think they just anounced a 2nd nga merger also today, no target but the team has more  canadians and has some ppl from energy background so could def be another ev play that u can get in super early if your broker allows units and warrents (aka anyone but rh).
It's Chinese, what did you expect?
Dkng $60 feb calls
You’re all free to roast the shit out of me for being a n00b but there’s one thing I just don’t get with calls. So you reckon the stock will hit 50 dollars in 2022, and if it does your $100 000 will be $200 000, yes? So why don’t you just buy the same amount in stocks and watch it double in value without risking legit everything? Is there something in this equation I’ve missed?
Putures Fumping

A few hundred or thousand shares is literally a drop in a bucket compared to tens of millions of shares being bought and sold daily. Give the guy a break, not a thousand WSB paperhand retards can move the price that much really. We've seen yesterday what a few dozen put options by gaybear tutes does to a price - nobody here has that kind of control over the price action.

Selling at 22 might've actually been a winning short-term play. I decided to 💎✋personally, after swing-trading forced me into owning less shares for a bigger investment (made profit, just not enough to maintain my original position), but even I thought about selling at $22 yesterday, because we slammed into that wall 2 or 3 times and it held without fail, so I knew then we are gonna drop down to 20-21 range.

But fuck it, short-term profits aren't worth risking the scenario where I own even less shares for more money...
I honestly will have to agree with you there. Same. My biggest wins here are all stupid meme shit lol. That and ICLN calls
anything on your watchlist?

This anti something on baba is nothing. Buy the dip is what I advise
I don't disagree with your logic but that exact line of thinking has me 50k down on BABA.

At a certain point you just have to accept the market isn't logical and just play bullshit instead. I have made more money on bullshit this year than anything else (PLTR - garbage stock, made 20k, QS garbage pump, made 10k, TSLA - 1200 PE, made 60k).

Logic doesn't make money anymore and this is probably my biggest lesson from the stock market recently.

What's your cost basis?
You dont think government insiders also hold large stakes in their national companies that are public?
He's not buying them today retard, he already had it likely when the spread was way larger between the two. Probably paid super cheap a few weeks ago
I bought 150 of these fckers right before the election at 12.80. Then they popped bigly, sold 50 at around 50, and then hold trough te dump. Thats when it hit me, These guys have 0 reveneu, no factory, a stacked board and potentialy great tech. But mass producing and a prototype are 2 different animals. 

&#x200B;

Then it hit me, Nikola hit 80 before they dumped, so i dumped all my shit around 90.

You might be right. I sold my entire position before GME earnings, I was 90% sure it was gonna dip, and it did.

Sherman is anything but a hypeman and yeah, this massive put buy might've been a calculated play by the gaybear tutes.

I'll evaluate in January, depending on what happens until then. If we continue having mostly green days like this, taking a short-term profit and re-entering again at a lower price point could actually be the best thing to do one more time.
Cathie looks at the technicals, will sell if it go below 50 DMA
You know cathie just bought a bunch of baba though lol
Smart, little moves in TLT make for big spikes.  Just keep it reasonably close to the money.
I was tempted to email them the other day asking why they're holding so much BABA and not JD instead.
It is a bit of work to keep up. But, if your in for LT then just ride it out. FB & CRW will be fine. It’s gyna that’s a bit more worrisome, so keep up with news :)

the thing i don't understand about these SPACs is how do you estimate how high the ticker for the acquiring company, in this case STIK, will go? Can I still get in tomorrow morning or too late now? What do you anticipate STIK share price will go to in the next few weeks? SPACs are a whole new ball game - usually in regular companies, if they are acquiring, the stock tends to go down bc the market expects some rough waters as they two companies integrate but this is obviously different.

Take this from my boys, an old general put out to pasture a long while ago. I led you into more gangs than I care to count, and I've got one more left for you.

TLT calls are the plays, bucks, if you think the 2k stimulus is going to happen.

IWM calls are the plays if you think the government is going to continue shooting itself in the dick.

Me? Well, I've got call spreads both ways, and that spread is just a bit tighter (smaller gap between strikes) on the TLT plays, so I win either way.

Cut the bad spread lose when you know which way the wind is blowing.

My next YOLO plan is NVAX after this, so hopefully CRM goes up and they go down in the meantime. Best of luck to you, thanks for checking in

First of all, I'm from Europe so my actions don't affect you in any way. Second of all, we've been locked down for much longer time than you guys have (you haven't even been locked down for the 2nd time, like serious lock down, police hour and can't leave your municipality).   


And thirdly, the fucking lockdown takes weeks to have an impact on cases. Just so some fucking 80 year old grandmas won't die, 98% of the population needs to be in war-like circumstances? Fuck that. Unreasonable, unrational. Grandmas stay at home, if you're fat, stay at home, its your own god damn fault.

How can $2000 pass. There's only 10 days left in the session. It's mostly holidays & weekends. Everyone probably already went home. They didn't even give close to $2000 when there was going to be a depression, so you think they giving that now? Most likely scenario: Trump just signs it. But since he lost reelection and he's butt hurt, the only other option is he doesn't sign it, and you get nothing until February. Which seems to be Trump's 2024 play. Rant about he wants to give you $2000, then not sign it. So you get $0. Then he can talk about how government is dysfunctional and you need him.

Future growth is necessary to justify being a BABA bull. With MSFT, antitrust caused a 14% drop. But the real damage was no more long term growth prospects. The result was MSFT didn't regain that 14% until 15 years later. This was all with pussy US regulators. In China, the downside risk is BABA gets deleted like Tiananmen. 200p 1/15
Tbh MSFT
How to play this IMO

At open if it does or doesn't spike up hard, buy ATM calls expiring next week

ride the day, if SP goes up steadily, hold to EOW next week

If it looks like a flat day, take the theta loss and sell prior to close
ohh its lookin pretty possible now isnt it

How often do those stats get out? Every 2-3 weeks?
Nothing is stopping you from buying.  Nothing.
326k people are dead, have some humanity
But for real though, anyone worried about a prolonged government shutdown? Like it took 6 month to come up with this package, I don’t think the $2000 will pass. I want it too, because I would love 2k extra monies.
Do you think that they’ll continue to get crushed today? They’re down like 7% premarket. Sorry about your position but I’m sure you know baba is a great holding. However I’m considering a call credit spread against them expiring this week. Wondering what you think of this antitrust probe for the short term. Long term I agree with you this stock is on sale rn

OMG! That's my exact plan too! ALL my MT (17x as of right now) calls for Feb & March have already started printing, but I'm greedy and if its printing this much and I'm not even at my break even number....then I'm gonna hold these bags, but as soon as I sell...I'm buying waaay more in PLTR. 
Just wish I hadn't of sold my PLTR 01/15/21 $29c I had 3 and sold them off 3 weeks ago, smh....SO I could buy more shares and leaps right at the start of the dip!
Fuck yeah.  I've gone to selling options, and while relatively boring, I don't get a lot of anxiety, nor do I have to wake up early to watch the markets.  Been getting 1-3k per week using just a little bit of margin as the collateral so I can keep my long-term holdings invested.

This week I sold puts on SNOW and PLTR.  I know SNOW is overvalued, but at the same time, it's but a shit tier company.  If I get assigned, I'll sell calls.  For PLTR, I would probably keep some of the shares if assigned and sell calls on others.
biggest issue with testing is availability and location. 

I've had first hand experience. Testing locations are complete jokes requiring you to drive thru a line for an hour and get your results 3-4 days or more later. Rapid tests are available but only at certain locations and usually cost much more or require you to have sufficient health insurance. Those tests still require you to go to a doctors office or a clinic and you'll still most likely end up waiting a day for the results. 


This test is AT HOME. You get one at the pharmacy for 15$, bring it home, swab your nose and get a positive confirmation result as soon as 2 minutes and a negative confirmation result in 15 minutes. No need for a clinic/long lines/medical professional, no long waits for results. You will know instantly. And the best thing about this is that its extremely accurate too. 


This is why its so huge. Its a testing game changer. 

You could do this shit before hopping on a flight, seeing family members, entering a venue, etc. No time wasted, no extra bullshit.

Yeah man. same here i can watch travel vlogs all day. I havent traveled since last summer 2019. I spent a few months in SE Asia: Thailand, Vietnam, Bali etc. I was living on $20/day including food. With a maid, wifi, and personal pool. I cant wait to rent a motorbike and start hitting the waves in Bali soon. Theres some hot girls that take holidays there too, australians and european girls. (im american)

I heard SE Asia reopens in Jan 2021, and although i can technically go, i am gonna wait to leave in Jun 2021, because i have a few things to get done before i go. But technically i can take off next week, if i wanted. It might be smart to see what happens shortly after reopening, dont want to get stuck in a country if their govt shuts down etc. 6 months is enough time to see what countries figure out a way to live with corona vs the ones who keep going on and off.

BABA not looking good in the short term, obviously, but not too worried long term as long as no one starts calling Xi Pooh Bear. It's an investigation, not a lawsuit, and they don't seem to be raiding offices and seizing contracts for now. The fact that the government is taking an interest might actually turn into a good thing long term.
Wow this premarket volume sucks dick. On some of my positions the tickets have like 3 digit volumes lol? I could probably pump and dump this on my own
Bought a lot of MVIS on the dip yesterday hoping for a spike as well as the supposed squeeze on GME today
My BABA positions  even more exotic.  Ce marché de merde😈
SGEN
we clearly hit the wall at $22, massive sell-off, both short and long positions. Hopefully, most longs sold off yesterday and we continue going up today, even for a modest 2-4% gain, just to keep the upwards trend.
Just rented a dope ass apartment with a pool and 2 saunas gonna have a fucking blast with about 15-17 people. Fuck covid and fuck the government. Fuck it all, this is not humane.
I doubled my money this week with GME already. Who’s to say it won’t happen again?
This can be seen as a wider move against Chinese mega caps. The party will now clamp down on companies getting too big to control. The fact that Ma and Alibaba actually need to be reigned back in by open warfare instead of backroom deals and punishment is concerning.
WHY. DOES. EVERY. FUCKING. DIP. GET. BOUGHT. JUST. LET. IT. CRASH. YOU. DUMB. ASS. FED. I. WANT. TO BUY.
number 3 is pretty retarded, actually extremely retarded

diversifying just to diversify is also retarded, buy stocks from companies you understand and hold them (if you already have a lot of capital and want to keep it safe, putting most of it into an index fund would be better than picking stocks anyway), trading in general is a bad idea so "never hold through earenings" is very retarded
Just pull out mayne tf

Interesting take... for confirmation of what you are saying, as a reference here is a link from the SEC about forced buying on the 13th day for stocks on the  threshold list.  
[https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm](https://www.sec.gov/divisions/marketreg/mrfaqregsho1204.htm)
Because the media will not report it. I wouldn’t be surprised if they started pulling out government officials from the capital and laying them out on the capital steps (red and blue).Trust me it’s a LARGE number. It will make the anti trump riots look like a small family gathering.
Futures are rallying right now due to the new mutation of Covid found in Nevada. That means more stimulus talks.

I paperhanded between $13-$14 range post-earnings. Daily swing trades. Made short-term profit, but due to a big upswing last Thursday and Friday, I am now also holding less shares for more money invested. I already basically lost hundreds of dollars of pure gains by not holding the $13.3 shares, and will continue to lose hundreds more as the price keeps going up.

&#x200B;

Nothing but 💎✋since last Friday. Paperhanding is clearly a losing play during this massive momentum GME is bringing to the table.
What is super dramatic though? If BABA decided to fuck with the CCP then 140 is still too high.

Buy buy buy!!!
Sell!!
My Dad refused to buy Amazon because "price was too high" so he bought the cHiNeSe aMaZoN bAbA
Its going to hit 2K in the next 6 weeks.
Is that Jack from Lost?? Haha
It's not "getting sued". This is China. Accuser, judge and executioner are the same people. 

That Alibaba will get punished is not a possibility, it's certain. And they better beg and kneel or there will be some people literally paying with their lives.
China executes a few billionaires for a reason, you are not exempt if you go against the system.

After all this time I still wonder how actual Chinese people like Ma are able to fuck that up. Hubris? Stupidity? No idea.
Going to go for GOEV instead. So much room to run.
Im kinda retarded but I would definitely hold, NIO day  1/9/21 price will definitely 🚀🚀🚀 easily $60. I also think its a good long term investment.
Poor soul
Baba holy shit
Nah the dip was already getting bought
I’m not an asshole and dont want to kill my parents. Waiting till this passes over but man I’m girl deprived
What are the pajama fucks doing rn
Buying. A K B A
In a blink of an eye, yes, if he keeps on pissing them off
Oh gosh what did Jackie Ma do now?😯
So glad I did not get into BABA calls yesterday
GO EV
Lol I got a spread call for baba yesterday of course
GOOGLE is currently being sued by 38 states. Wasn’t even down a full percent the day that news broke lol
Yeah prob right.

Why is JD getting fucked too
Why would you ever sell? Nio is just getting started. They raised 10B$ last month, with this money they can build factories in US and Europe and expand their branch.
While I will yolo this, it breaks the below $1B market cap rule. Just a heads up.
>I’d buy up baba IMO the big dogs are always getting sued

Remember when FB was in trouble in June end and went parabolic right after? Hope the same happens with BABA unless they get dicked
Get in on gold boys
RIP BABA
Yeah kind of on the fence about April or maybe splitting them and trying out a couple June positions but I got all weekend to drive myself crazy thinking about tendies so we'll see where I end up.
Is my nio call done for😠😩
Hes a legend but have you heard interviews with him? Bruce Lee was Bruce Lee's number 1 fan.
More than 100% of publicly available shares for GME are shorted at this time. To cut losses most of flow will have to be bought back from diamond hands like us, and to do that shorters will have to offer higher than market price for shares.

If people having shares will keep diamond hands shorters will have to offer f.e. $23 per share at open (if that was to happen today) to persuade us to sell, but we have to keep cool and DON'T SELL, till they will start giving much higher offers and they have to give higher offers because over 100% of flow is shorted. Obviously not all of it ends on the same day, though squeeze may happen in just one day, like it was with Volkswagen back in the day.

Small example - when big player is amassing big volume of shares, like R.Cohen did few days ago, shares jumped from under $13 to well above $16 (currently at ~$21) to increase amount of shares he holds by "just" 3% (without calculating let's assume that was sth like 5% of publicly available shares). Imagine him being in panic mode needing to buy 20%+ of available shares at any given day and that there would be few of them (bit exaggerated for obvious reasons) - you could get $40 at no problem. Imagine share holders staying cool and not selling for less than $100 :)

That's why it is important to hold shares, because in the longer run GME will get to at least $30-40 squeeze or not (console cycle is just starting, and for now GameStop apparently has new consoles in store, which are in deficit on market, means income), with quite many saying it being at least $40+, and if Cohen will take over and present some superb plan to make GameStop Amazon for gamers, cosplayers, collectors, and your local esport hub, with some other superb offers only young visionary can come up with GME holders will see those 30 or 40 in the rear mirror of a 🚀 shooting up much higher because big good news might mean price hike, and on top of that one of shorters might say "better start buying those XX% of shares now" - BANG - domino starts, other shorters get into panic buying, SHORT SQUEEZE 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀 !

Holy shit why is baba down so much? That stock has been a nightmare for the past few months.
i live in the most lockdown state in the country besides NY, i live in CA and a lot of bars are open and people are at the beaches. Theres definitely some parties going on, maybe not as much but people are still doing things. The opportunities are 100% there to be found.
Lmao im buying 50 dollar calls at 7
BABA taking the stairway to hell

Hold and buy more as people panic thinking nio is a monopoly in China. BABA and NIO are not associated.
I’m gonna make Melvin bend the knee with the 177 shares I’ll buy today
flat day
Im 700+ shares deep in this bitch. 

Got in at about 5, 6, and 7$ bought a little at 9.50 when the rise to 18 was happening so my avg is somewhere around 7-8.

A lot of people got fucked with this stock because of the slander campaign by Hindenballs which subsequently tanked it. 

Moreover, Ji really sucks at PR. And i mean, REALLY sucks at it. 

He's a smart man, but can't do PR to save his life. A lot of speculation and worry comes from his grammatical errors or poor choices in words despite genuine talking points/updates. 


I've seen the ups and downs with this stock and I've noticed Ji is being smart now, keeping his mouth shut and focusing solely on practical announcements. We are now only hearing about definite progress, authorizations and pipeline goals being met, not anymore on the "its going well! cover shorts! soon!" 


Ji is too honest and forward for his own good. A lot of people back in the summer and fall months wanted immediate results and products on the market, but this shit took time to play out. Biotechs are like that, you need to follow the right procedures, tests and FDA guidelines to get shit out there. A lot of people heard "wow a great solution to covid! look at all this stuff!" and wanted overnight results. Luckily we are on the tail end and should be seeing those results in Q1 of 2021. Lots of EUAs now on the table, stage 2/3 trials and endorsements/funding coming through. 

Also, worth noting that they have a pretty incredible cancer non-opioid pain management drug on the horizon too. (It uses capsaicin, yes the hot pepper chemical)

Overall this stock to me is one you really need to do your DD on to feel comfortable with, because you sure as hell wont get it from day traders who get angry when they dont see the huge pop overnight. (though right now i think we will see some of that action with covi stix approval if it goes through in the next 15 or less days)

Anyway. I'm 100k or bust on this one.
nah. False. You also were talking about limiting down all positions today. This ain't no black swan. The fuk
OP going long on letters and sentences. TLDR at the beginning next time
Someone tell your Papa Elon to dick up the stock so my call doesn’t go to $0 EOD

Only those positions that have failed to deliver for 13 days need to be closed. Now I lack the patients to comb through the Treshhold securites list right now to add up how many positions are effected by that. But I doubt it's enough to force a double digit % squeeze.
That would tank their stock market in International markets, no way they would do that

bye bye portfolio. Time to wipe the slate clean...
True!

Well, that kind of already happened. My options account started at $1k and I got a really solid day trading plan down - and after 100 trades or so, in about 3 weeks I was able to get it to $3k. I have an exported list of all the trades I could show if you’re interested.

But then I said fuck the plan, got greedy, and yolo’d it on a GME fd. I felt like an absolute buffoon. Lost the 2k I made in 4 hours...

The painful lessons hit the hardest. Fucking IV crush man.

we'll be here to see your loss porn in a few days.
She singlehandedly saved my lgvw positions god bless her. (Btw how do you spell that shit handedly handly handedely?)
Buying a $30 call on XZY date basically means that you're willing to buy GME for $30 per share up until the XYZ date. If the price of the stock doesn't go above $30 + whatever you paid to buy the option (premium), you basically lose all your money in most cases, because that option is worthless (well, you could still MAYBE sell that call to someone else and not lose ALL your money, you know, toss a hot potato into someone else's hands, but that's kind of a, you know, dick move... but if there's a retard willing to buy it, I guess he'll lose money anyway, so better you keep some of yours at the very least)

Put is reverse, you're willing to sell at $30 price up until XYZ date. If the price of the stock doesn't drop below $30 minus whatever you paid to buy the option (premium), you'll probably lose all your money, or a lot of it if you manage to toss the hot potato to someone else.

There is additional pricing included in the options' values, based on volatility, time decay, fancy shit like that which they call "extrinsic value", which is calculated with "greeks" (delta, theta etc...). I don't know enough about those greek letters to begin with, let alone what they mean in relation to options, but they can be explained in layman's terms too, it's just easier to use one word for something instead of an entire sentence every time.

There, that's the crash course. Now DM me $10 for the lesson to my PayPal, additional bonuses welcome.
That was right around election day so shit was not stable those few days
RIP BABA
Very **very true**.
Lit. One thing I will admit: I have more fear of civil unrest/societal breakdown than I ever have before. I still think there’s no way groups like that succeed, but there’s a chance they could try something and cause damage in the process.

Sometime back in like June I went and bought a 9mm. Can’t ever be too hedged when it comes to your life lol
The reason why chinese EV stocks have been mooning is that the CCP will be favoring domestic manufacturers, and the switch over from combustion engine vehicles to EV is on the horizon (3-5 years maybe?).

That will be a huge market, and AAPL is already comfortable with china both from a manufacturing and consumer market point of view. Not sure if TSLA would ever partner with a chinese manufacturer to get into the chinese market but I can see AAPL partnering with NIO to get access to market. (Note that NIO is not a "car manufacturer" per se, they outsource production like AAPL does with their products.)

Jamie's resume above seems to lend credence to the speculation, he'll have worked for both NIO and AAPL and could serve as liaison to both companies if the idea for partnership becomes serious.

NIO has 4 models - autonomous driving would be a killer app for them over their competitors.

edit: broken into paragraphs, added stuff about NIO production and last paragraph
Feels like we are going to continue the dump we had at market close yesterday.

Yeah I was referring to the pump and dump that is the point when 2/3 of the WSB posts are commenting on a specific stock it generally means that the bag holders are in place and the IV is set to collapse.   But you're talking about actual valuation which is something I doubt most people on this sub (myself included) are qualified to even pretend to discuss.  That being said, they're closing 10% of their stores this year alone and many more next.  This is not a good sign of growth.

I purchased feb19 $15p yesterday for full disclosure, not because I feel any sort of way about GME but because of the huge influx of WSB posts generally means the end is near.
Greed when odas is sked

No no bro I totally consider it normal conversation for me to disagree with you and then for you to present your counterargument and so on and so forth. That’s what we were doing until you said not to kill the messenger. I’m making a value judgement on the information you presented. I ain’t offended bro, are you offended ?
Best thing: he bought that url back from PayPal, so he could actually use it
Seems like a lot of the propping is done outside of regular trading hours when there's less volume. Easier to push prices up to set the tone for the trading day I guess.

Would you attend a party deep in the woods where the condition for attendance was that you had to take a heroic dose of a hallucinogen (provided by the organizers), and there was a 1-in-100 chance that your dose also included a powerful dose of something that would be guaranteed to kill you (painlessly) during the event?

I don’t roll like that, I’d rather have an actual conversation which is what I thought we were doing believe it or not
hope it drops to 100
They're commies, don't believe in christmas
Yes
Do y’all ever look back at past relationships and think about what it could’ve been, idk i just got past a big breakup and nights like this when I’m all alone i start to think about what it could’ve been and what not
Got a 2023 exp that I’m prayin on
I'm in the same boat..what did you buy in at?
Lol bro you have weak hands. They will be in compliance. BABA is Chinas golden child, it’s what the whole world looks at. They aren’t just going to break it up. Stop spreading fear. The dust will settle and things will get back to normal as both sides come to an agreement that sellers can sell on whatever platform along with Ali baba. This will have little to no effect on Alibabas bottom line and Q4 earnings either way will be out of the park. You just sound like someone spreading fear to short the stock or buy puts
I’m liquidating tomorrow open. Just like you said, it’s now impossible to predict what will guide the stock. Maybe the CCP will hand out the olive branch and stock recovers, but they already rejected Ma’s offering once. They may be out for blood.
a month ago yes
Depends on what price it opens at. Support is ~235. If it opens above that I think puts are reasonable.
Who the fuck actually spends their time on r/options

some calls
Futes green open green?????
No that's for 23 million contracts, this is only a meager 2billion increase
That's the market in general, it's always trying to price in the future and make money off the arbitrage.
Why is everyone talking about alibaba? What happened?
Europoors gonna poor
not necessarily with ramped manipulation

All in on 15.4 here, I missed the $12 and $13 tickets too, but we're already long way away from the launchpad, so I'm not gonna sweat it.

i wish i could just put my phone away and not look at my portfolio for an entire year. i'm just so fucking bored, unemployed and waiting to get a vaccine so i can go backpacking. i'm 100% all in on PLTR too (4309 shares) so it's not like there's any managing or moves to be made... I'm just gonna hold and hold and go fuck around in like Vietnam or something spending 20 dollars a day.

So I’m googling Foley Trasimene (BFT). I’m a nurse. First of all a Foley is what we stick in the peepee hole to drain a bladder and tranexamic acid is something they put through the Foley catheter into the bladder to stop bleeding.

Right. Enjoy losing 40% of your investment over the course of two years before you eventually lose hope and sell before it actually gains traction. Totally missed my whole point. You okay?
Jack Ma has aligned himself (loosely) with "the shanghai clique" which is an opposing faction to the maoist party which is presently in control.
Thank you all gay bears. Sincerely. Thank you. Thank you for making me tendies betting against PLTR. Please continue what you do because I need more tendies. Your tendies :)

Got covid aids and is feeling ok now 👌
I did sell covered calls so I have some protection against a pullback. Tried puts last week and not only did I feel like a gay bear it was a waste of money.
Never
I don’t think yesterday’s dump is going to be bought up. I’m thinking this dump is going to last until January 6th.
I'm so fucking poor my only choice right now is a trading app that only allows buying and selling shares. No options, no margin, nothing.

Still, if GME gets squoze to 10x, I'll not be acting normally for a week, or a month...

Gotta get past the fear and anxiety amigo. Try to stay off socials too much. Call your family often (if that doesn’t bother them), drink a lot of water, eat real food, sleep as much as you can, workout.

But really, start with taking some deep breaths. Then see how many you can take in 3 minutes, then maybe longer. 

Maybe jog around the block or do push-ups. Jumping jacks. Get the body moving to curb brain activity.

Next support is 235
Same here was planning to set limits at $30 $50 and $100 but you know, I may just hold out til $100 cos this is a historic event and I wanna be part of it. Go big or go home
Fucking hell dude, $25?! We got destroyed by the $22 wall today.

But, I hope you're fucking right, a move up that high is gonna print a $1000 gain for me just from owning shares alone. I can live a full month off of that money, without even caring about how much I spend lol!
All I want for Christmas is twwwwwooooo % gain on IWM overnight. 🎅
sighs would Pinduoduo be a play? i got rekt by JD 12/18 calls. it never recovered after earnings so im gonna hold off on options for now. still averaged down on shares when it dipped under 80 the past few weeks. do you know any other smaller competitors that could benefit from these anti monopoly regulations?
Yea I bought 200 at $4.8 thinking it was surely going to rocket...bought another 200 at $3.6.... holding a heavy bag but the long term gains are worth. Listing on the nasdaq coming, promising programs that are making their way... I dono just gonna ignore the fat negative until shares blow past $10 haha. Plus I've taken so much Acid i'm probably bias and if you are gonna long hold an investment, better believe in it right?
I lost money once because someone talked me out of a play here

it was valuable lesson in not being an approval seeking beta cuck
Kinda deceptive. The pandemic wfh fell in their lap this year which is like 128% of the total gain. Still solid plays but not miraculous.
call spreads, the IV and price action in tsla just isn’t there anymore
That’s why they are poor!
So, what? They’re not making progress. 
They failed.

I’m going to sleep in tomorrow, and when i wake up I expect all you GME millionaires to be flexing in my face
Where do they have that?
Look at the technicals
Watch closely during the first hour after market opens. GME tends to have a big spike during that time, so if it gaps up similar to last 2 days, you might even grab some gains.
F
Buy put spreads on the right companies, not some yolo. 

You should aim for >30% return with >75% POP. Spread it out across industries to avoid a massacre. Only lock up a percentage of your cash you're comfortable losing in an instant. Starting with 50k maybe that's 30%. 15k for selling puts could bring in 2-3k/mo no sweat.
Why baba though
350k is a life changing amount of money for most people. At 23 it’s enough to set you up for life if you use it right. If you truly earned that money through your own hard work and you’re not bullshitting us, be smart about it
Buy fucking shares!

It still costs money though. As someone has been a big part of major data programs for 10 years it will be a hard sell to senior leadership. It was a hard sell to go to the cloud bc the ROI is hard to pitch. What I’m telling you is most companies just spent millions doing this. Now a newer shiny object is coming and people will be saying “lets implement this”, and they’ll say “why, what’s the roi, why do we need it?” In my experience selling data programs to leadership is hard because they don’t understand it, it’s expensive, and “making things easier on the people doing the work” isn’t enough. They have to get value from it in increased revenue or cost reductions. Government selling is easy -> we’ll help you catch bad guys because I can guarantee government data is probably a shit show. Retail is different. You can’t assume better data integration and modeling will increase sales moreso than what they’ve already got in place. Maybe you can but it won’t be immediate. 

It isnt plug and play. You would need to hire Palantir to do that and add on annual fees. Adoption will be slow, expect that is all I’m saying. This isn’t windows. 

Having said that, from what I’ve seen it seems to be best in class for what it’s offering. Ive not seen one platform that does what gotham and foundry do which plays well together.

Ya sure he can. If he wants to see China's financial markets and possibly global financial markets collapse lol. The financial markets are all too interconnected and big money is tied up everywhere. Imagine all foreign investments pulling out of China because everyone got spooked. China's economy would break. And it would have a tsunami effect on the rest of the world's financial market. All of us will be eating instant noodles for the next decade.

Like the guy below says, "evil, yes. retarded, no." lol
Tough, we hit a godamn wall at $22 today, as if some invisible force was not letting it inch one cent above.

But good luck, I'm rooting for ya. I'm all in shares here, so a move up that high will print a fat gain for me too.
Sorry for the noob question  but why would people short GME right now? Are they expecting a sell off due to the recent price increase?
I'm new to finance and this is unclear to me.
There is no way this is real, it’s *way* is too low.

Getting leaps on baba if it touches 240. Ez money

It just rejected off trend resistance but could just keep hugging it and even break it and make it support because why not?
Dumbass 13 year old me doesn't know half the things I just said
Yes, to capitalize on having the right psychology you need to have Dr. PP level finance knowledge (or take the advice of someone who does) so you can make an educated decision on when the top is to lock in maximum profits & you'll be able to differentiate between a temporary dip vs. a medium/long-term downward spiral

Recent examples:

Hold through gains: CRSR - went to $30, then $40, & got as high as $50

Cut your losses: BABA - this was not a temporary dip

Hold through temporary dip: GME
Neat. So 2K return?

I want it to be around 103 years. Not only for 102.
The thing with AAPL is that even though big stories like the car news push the price, a 5% rise adds about a hundred billion to the market cap. PTON is 50 Billion in comparison. So while Apple is a solid bet, it is certainly not a runner like the smaller companies. TSLA won’t run as crazy anymore as it did a couple month ago either, simply because of its market cap.
What is the most reliable or definitive list of the short float? I use Trade Ideas and they had been reporting the short float at 137%. Last night that number was shown as 144%. IBKR tells me the number of shares available to buy but not how many shares are shorted.  I am seeing 60-70% numbers being thrown around.

I will also have to eat a small loss, but I will instantly leave that stock at open. I'm not having even my small position go down with Ma.

Sounds strange from someone who was bullish a week ago but when the CCP declares war I'm out. This stock is now purely trading on politics, not revenue or growth.
Write off 3k and keep 2k in losses for next year or grow some balls and YOLO whatever you got in your pockets. Year isn’t over.

wsb brothers I need ur sage guidance and wisdom. I come to u with my future: UCSB, or UCSD? Thank you autists.
When they buy a call, someone else sold it. That person is now short 100 shares. They can offload their risk, but they cannot eliminate it. Someone will wind up short. It doesn't have to be the original shorters who lose out.

Also, institutions don't like to sit on losing plays. Once they know they're going to lose money, they move on. That means selling the call and buying to close (or executing the call, which has the same effect).
Needs more confidence

I kept reading, expecting a YOLO and going back to $0. Man... what a cliffhanger... guess I have to wait few more weeks for part 2 then...
with the bad news after hours, the stock has already tanked to 247. i expect it to fall into the 230s tomorrow. sadly, i cant even use the tax loss harvesting because my baba shares are in my ira sigh
Inverse your gut, your welcome
Hope you’re right
I can do nothing right. I keep deploying the dry powder and the market moves instantly the opposite direction. My puts were in the red by the time the trade executed. Things are looking better throughout the night rn
Don’t we all 😈
Like 30% of US stock value is simply based on the certainty that the US gouvernment can not just go in, execute the CEO and divide up the company.

I see the "Look undervalued China companies are trading at 20 p/e!" case for China stocks so often. Yet people seem to fail to understand why that is actually a fair value, pricing in the risks.
Cause the CCP says so and your company is dead. Finished. A market cap of 0.
The CCP says so and your company doubles in value. That's China.

Xi can come out tomorrow saying Tencent will now be ten companies. That's the reality of a dictatorship.

I agree with you. Except it’s hard to work out how the market will price this ongoing uncertainty. It will be fine 6 months plus but rocky in between
Interesting how this was the deadliest year ever for the US. It’s almost as if covid is actually real. 🤔🤔

That means nothing dude, 2 big green days doesn't mean we're heading to the moon right away.

We hit a fucking wall today, I was watching in real time as $22 got rejected HARD twice. A lot of paperhanded shit going on, don't count on FDs to print every day.

I still think we're in for a $30-60 price in 2021, fuck, maybe even $100+ if the squeeze gets squoze, but I would not burn my money on weeklies/dailies, too much volatility to form any rational call thesis imo.

Then again, a bunch of you retards seem to enjoy the pure masochism you subject yourselves to, so call away, fuck I care, it's not my money anyway...
Everyone needs some time to themselves to shitpost. That's the secret sauce to success.

Can’t sell a damn thing till next year unless it’s for a loss. That tax bill for 2020 gonna be serious. Hope my stonks don’t crash till then. 400 shares of palantir im talking about you.
Yup I was in baba till I saw this thing dropping to 260$ after it went to 279. I got out. Cut my losses. I had lost about 4K from 290c for February 19 2021. This shit got a whole load of bad news in it. I won’t put a dime in this thing until all of this shit is resolved. Rather sit this one out on the sidelines.
Like an ETF, but not necessarily exchange traded, most have lousy returns, they charge you outrageous maintenance fees every year, and boomers think they're the shit.
WA state has extended the ban of evictions for another 3 months.  I expect other states will follow.

You think it will come down or is it gonna keep going up. Im just thinking about if i should wait to buy or buy now...
Honest question: Someone please give me 1 reason why buying more shares on BFT would be a bad idea.

y’all really thinking calls on BABA tomorrow? could maybe go lower tbh?
All my calls broken even yesterday at 10am and then got distracted at work (Again! Thankfully mine expire 12/31). Was debating about selling off a couple if they dipped, for the 1st time worked distracted me in a positive way.

Probably not, but as an engineer I use Excel for everything.
From my understanding they take different groups of data that have nothing in common and are able to find connections between them. It’s supposed to save companies millions on data mining by automating it for them. So yeah I’m still wondering what they do
I would say consider Berkeley and UCLA for grad as well, maybe an MBA at either of those.

When I was buying them there was pretty much two options. Went with barkbox cause it was cheaper and the name must have hooked me. Top notch customer support.

My degs absolutely loved it. So fired up whenever it came each month. I donno about the percentage of dogs that absolutely demolish their toys vs the ones that don't, but my dogs did. They murdered any toys extremely quickly which makes a constant re up really nice.

To get votes from his voter base. As a right-wing guy, I can assure you that currently, the vast majority of right-wingers support Trump more than the GOP. Right-wingers right now look at the GOP with the same view that lefties look at Biden: "Hey, at least that's not the other guy." That's not a great thing to rely on. It works only a handful of times.

With an avg of 260 you’re still good compared to my avg of 285 lol. No one knows what will happen but if it trades similar to its last drop then this might very well bleeds for a few days /weeks before rebounding and then dip again. Anyway I believe baba is too big to fail and will most certainly not go away anytime soon so it will eventually recover but I’m selling most of my shares as the opportunity cost of it slowly bleeding and staying flat for months before it’s recovery is too high for me.

I would honestly argue that stressing about making it rich is universal to any trader. To those people getting to your account balance is already “making it rich.” So it’s all relative I guess. The difference is the downside stakes are higher if you have less liquid. If you have $100k in the first place to trade you’re comfortable financially otherwise. If you’re trading on $1k in desperation to escape uncomfortable financial circumstances taking loss is way worse. Then again I’ve never had a 6 figure account so I’m talking out my ass. Grass is always greener.

But I'll suck it up and buy back. But Cathie is a hot as milf, she's like a jipper grade school teacher.

Apparently everyday futures when Europe is open is free money because it pumps everytime if we are green. If futures are red, it dumps everytime.
I am still bullish 100% for the long term. However there are some short terms plays with UK stocks atm
Less risky if anything to just buy some borderline fd naked calls. You can always turn them into debit spreads or pmccs later on if you feel the need to hedge.
Cut loses. Buy PLTR shares
I do and it's still the same boat imho. It just makes it more stressful because you actually believe you might make it rich. So you end up getting into positions way past your comfort zone, it's worse really,  anyone can make a few grand back if they lose it.  that's a zero stress situation.

Im glad for these posts to be honest. And bless the mod that pinned it for a while. Lately GME has gotten an unsustainable pump around here, it makes me nervous when people come up with ludicrous price targets short term and talk about how imminent all of it is within 1-2 months.

I fully believe in the short term bullcase, and will probably keep a couple shares even after all the craziness wears down, because there is a decent bullcase long term too. 

But the bearcase and outsiders offer a perspective we all fucking need right now.

100% agree and as the saying goes, it’s not what you know, it’s who you know. And I can vouch for that as I got a pretty sweet gig as soon as I finished my masters thesis from one of my course mates. I’m not sure I’d be doing so sweet if it wasn’t for that. 

I’d largely agree with you. I don’t think editing/multimedia/VFX NEED a degree, not that it’s a bad thing otherwise. But I think a lot of skills can be learnt outside of an education environment. I’m not in that field so no idea, but that’s my perspective on it.

Good luck on your journey! Sometimes the biggest risks reap the biggest rewards

Damn! That's awesome, if you're having consistent positives and you make sure to put away enough to get your job back once you lose it all then best of luck!
Stoned off my gourd at like 3AM skimming through the daily threads here back maybe around may. The comment just said MVIS. I lurked around their sub and really believed in what’s going on. Waited and entered just above a dollar for the first time. Jumped mostly in and out but slowly been trying to get to around 500/1000 shares before February/March. 

I think the show really starts around April. I believe there will be demo of some of the tech, hopefully showcasing Microvision’s advantages over other Lidar systems . Look up IVAS CNBC on YouTube and you’ll probably land on the right video showing the combat helmets that have some incredible potential. These are just a couple catalyst I believe have had an affect on the stock price currently, and in the future. I’m long on this so the price action for the moment will hopefully help me create the position I want. 

Current position 250 shares @ $4.16 average bought the 50 additional today at around $7.15. 


Good luck and do your own fucking research.

Up to you mate do your own DD. I’ll personally wait for a dip. The merger isn’t scheduled until Q2 21 at the earliest so IMO I don’t want to tie up a portion of my account yet when I have other SPACS that should moon before then. If I miss out on 10% then so be it but I should hit other 100%s in the mean time and still catch the main STIC gains.

OP should not be trading anymore. The key is knowing when you should walk away from the table. This is a casino. You can always come back. 

Honestly, if you look at my post history I'm quite... out there. This is supposed to be fun. Not a means to a end. Do not gamble what you cant lose. When the pull back actually happens, it's going to wipe a lot of people out. The secret is to avoid disaster.

$200 would be roughly the middle of his squeeze price range. I'd be down to sell all the way at $155 though, that's a fucking 10 bagger for me, I'd need 2 years to make that money with my current income sources...
This is amazing great run! Minimal draw downs and not even that much size for your account size. What position size do you normally trade with? And are you trading ft?
The irony is any of this is gonna work right now, calls on anything the past month and the better part of this year have pretty much been free money. 
Ive done swing trades with calls on underlyings with 30/60 day out expiry, been completely wrong on what i thought would happen, bagheld for a week or two and sold for a profit anyway.

Just make sure you lock some profit in because at some point this shit is gonna stop working.

Gme is going to fuck all of you

Brexit passed and the EU cucked, as is their nature
I mean, this works until it doesn’t. More often than not, volatile moves to the downside are market overreacting to what it inteprets as bad news, only to realize that all is not that bad and nothing fundamentally changed, so you recover. I’ve seen unexpected double digit (%) losses turn into double digit gains over a few weeks, and sitting on losses was worth the wait in 99% of the cases, while quickly cutting loses saved me from more losses in 1% of the cases. 

The reason why I cut losses or incurred losses to begin with, in many occasions, i trading randomly, without a plan, without understanding of wide market context or the company/industry I invested in, and, most importantly, with too large positions so that I felt pressured to release some cash in order to invest elsewhere where I could “compensate for the loss quickly” (bullshit, you could also rush into anothee trade and lose more elsewhere). All fucking rookie mistakes. 

So yeah, I agree that you definitely want to “let your winners run”, but I think you want to think hard about your losers and don’t cut them immediately. If stonks only go up, then your loss is a temporary speedbump and you’ll recover, assuming that you can just sit on the loss and have enough cash and capital elsewhere. Cut losses if you really don’t believe recovery is possible, but you have to distinguish between company being objectively fucked or everyone waking up to the fact that it’s overcalues, and market freaking out over share dilution but fundamentals are still there. That requires some learning and thinking, but it’s worth it.
lol i hope so I bought 12/24 33.5 calls yesterday for $2 a contract
Thanks for this. I'm a mess
Not fucked because this is why you bought the leaps instead of 100s of shares, in case this happened.

If you were never planning on exercising them and only want to make money off premium cut loss if it's small. Fuck china. Stonks only go up in free markets

I'm tempted to go in on GM in the future. It will be a long-term play, targeting mid to late 2023 LEAPS at the absolute minimum.

/u/traz64 is right. MARA traded sub 5 dollars months ago. The same for NIO when it traded sub 10 dollars beginning of the year.  TSLA  is similar with shares bought before march. The thing about pennystocks is that a 0.50 move can generate the same as a $5 move on an option. The problem is penny stocks stay flat for a long ass time.
People on here think travel, resorts and the restaurant industry are the economy.
Seems like a lot of you OG longs that bought in $4s and $5s are selling nowadays. I can't blame you, it's a 4x/5x, but I'm glad at least some of you still see more upside.

Hey guys, for all of you guys who are financially successful, I was wondering in your opinion how much should you have saved up by every age.

For example 21- 20k 22- 30k etc

Currently i’m at 22 with 30k. Finishing school and planning to make anywhere between 50-70k next year. If this is the case, most of it will be going to savings and paying off student loans. (I don’t plan on paying my student loans off in a lump sum, I rather see Tesla gains.)

Lots of info in this thread but nobody saying this: there is some value to the name on the degree if you want to get hired out of undergrad. Yea you learn the same stuff but you’ll have to get a higher GPA usually to compete with students at a better school. Sometimes paid less even if you do get the job. But this is just one factor. Nowadays it seems like either people either only care about this or totally disregard it when choosing a school.

The advice about getting an internship and using connections is good. The advice about starting a small business instead is so-so. Always easy to say just start a business, hard to do it without some experience and a network of some kind. Also, depends on how much school is costing you.

I agree with your third bullet point, that's something I immediately thought about as well. I worked in a factory that needed a fuckton of storage space, but the company owning that factory also dabbled in retail business.

The kind of properties you need for retail and the kind you need to store shit are RADICALLY different. You can't just repurpose stores into warehouses, or at least you wouldn't be able to do it optimally.

That said, I'm bullish on GME and I'm all in. There are way too many potential positive catalysts accumulating around this company for me to NOT be invested in it.
Wow I’m amazed you think the average 19 year old has 6,500 invested. No, mid 20s

Good. There's a reason there aren't 7.8 billion super yachts in the ocean right now. Not everyone gets to make it.

If we were all making crazy gains I'd know something was off and I wouldn't go near the market. Seeing other's losses is the only reason I'm confident that you can win.
Yeah someone brought it up earlier. This is pretty much a conspiracy theory, but maybe it was coincidence, maybe GME timed the news who knows lol maybe they covered then re-shorted at the top? Was it HTB that day?

You can outsource many expensive lessons by watching others make the mistakes with their money. Some people, myself included, need that financial face-smack for some of those to sink in even if they watch others do it.
I went to berkeley and then ucla. Very familiar with most of the uc's.

Academically: in my time at Cal, UCSD was the number 3 UC. Once i got to grad school, SB grew in prestige, so they're very similar. Personally i think SB is behind SD and Irvine, but many at UCLA feel diff.

Social life: SB is hands down a party school, and a paradise at that. SD, while in La Jolla, isn't as fun as it appears. The school is known as a nerd school, even less social than Berkeley. As an SD native, i went to Cal while all my friends went to UCSD. When they visited me they commented how Berkeley was more alive than SD. And thats saying a LOT given that Berkeley is a highly depressing atmosphere as a school.

Location: both beaches but La Jolla is overrated compared to SB. LJ is also very snotty, whereas SB is chill and relaxed. SD has the better library advantage, if thats ur thing. But i know very few ppl who care about that stuff.

Girls: SB > SD by a thousand.

If experiences matter more than the slight academic edge that SD provides, and ur major doesnt heavily favor one over the other, go with SB.

How the fuck do I do this so I don't have to go on this shit stain of a subreddit anymore?
OP, how i see it, you're going to see a dip when lock up ends. Afterwards then you're clear for take off. Average down on your contracts. Maybe pick up a sweet 2023 contract 40% out of the money. They'll all print.

If it goes over 28.50 (which as of my writing this it is) then you have the *option* to buy them for 28.50 (technically you can exercise it even when market is below strike). You've already paid 70 bucks for the right to do this.

So yeah, if it goes past 29.20 you can exercise the contract and sell them at market values (the 70 bucks is gone). That's your breakeven.

Alternatively, if the cost of the contract goes up you can just sell it to some other tard for more than you bought it for(Edit: u/SeekNDestroy- mentions this route). This may be safer as you get your feet whet.

I saw it happen so idk what to say. I bought in that day thinking the squeeze was happening. I made monies and then lost all of what id made. Someone else on this sub posted a post that day right before shit got halted saying GME squeeze about to happen, they had different reasons, or at least they didnt mention reg sho. Then it fucking popped up and sold off on the friday. If anything happens tm its gonna play differently and no one on this board knows how so think critically abt it and do what u can IMO
It squeezed the last time entirely on Microsoft news. Shorts covering may are may not have played a role, but without the news nothing would’ve happened

Don't go to college if you are going to fuck around.  I still pay loans on a degree that's completely unrelated to my current field because I thought doing drugs, going to concerts and playing melee all night was preferably to going to class.  Made great friends but boy did I waste money.
I would actually sell and wait for this to pass to reestablish the leap. The news we have been seeing with china is the tip of the iceberg. It will continue into the next administration and the next because there is a real possibility for a duopoly moving forward less action is taken.

The trading was halted exactly the moment Microsoft news were released, so at the very least it was a catalyst forcing some shorts to cover. However, considering 60m+ volume on that day and the fact that SI **increased** afterwards, I highly doubt that a lot of shorts covered, seems like organic buying

Also, most MM's hedge the calls they sell by buying underlying shares. They're literally selling covered calls, just like you would do yourself, the only difference is they do it reactively rather than proactively.

The MMs have to do this, otherwise they'd risk losing a fuckton of money. So, shorties buying calls only further push the price up.

That's why yesterday, some entity with deep pockets, most likely one of those massive shorties like Melvin or BofA, bought 60k put options, which prompted MMs to immediately hedge with massive short selling, slamming the price down to \~$20.5.

MMs don't care, they always cover their assess to stay afloat, but time is not on the shorties side, the more they wait, the more they bleed.

Meanwhile, us retards can keep up the 💎👐 forever, inevitably leading to shorties covering at some point.

I'm still not entirely sold on this MOASS thing though, there seem to be multiple venues for shorts to cover without triggering the launch to Mars, but there is a chance for it to happen, so fingers crossed.
BABA IS the Black Sheep.

Ericsson has hope because of how active they are in 5G infrastructure, Nokia is fucked until every earnings report because they have no marketing team. I have 2000 stocks in Nokia and will just leave it there until they decide to do something in the next 50 years.
Id long to sell an overpriced CC if it shoots up. I did that last month for easy money, I'd do it again.

u_ninjas_not_welcome is right. I know it’s hard but you are able to blame the 500+ members of Congress who fell into party lines and voted on this garbage for this rather than blaming trump. Swear to god everyone gonna be lost without Trumpy to pin all there problems on next year

Apparently you don’t realize that?!
Fair enough. That’s funnily enough how it started for me. Went into meme stocks, did solid with no losses, went into options, won huge, and then tried more options and lost everything I gained (and went a bit into the red). I then got my shit together and am way up from where I previously was.
HYLN fucking dropped after merger. Also XL have wayyyyyyyy more contracts with companies whereas HYLN hasn’t announced shit really.

I thought that was bogdanoff. Did he retire
I have GOEV but I also have a lot of baba shares :(
Because misery loves company
So is BABA ded and my shares are fucked?
College is not a scam if you make the most of it. People just don’t do shit and neglect the resources their given
why the fuck would i want to read even more words from you about how you believe it should be illegal for you to take a -28% loss on a stock position

maybe you should look in the mirror and ask yourself why you didn't sell after a +60% day yesterday instead of trying to create an "illegal market maker" bogeyman to blame. might be a learning experience that allows you to not take another huge drawdown somewhere down the line. cheers.
How could you make money at $25? You'd have to exceed your premiums to make any money right?

That’s because this is a task order under their IDIQ they have that was originally announced in [October.](https://www.google.com/amp/s/finance.yahoo.com/amphtml/news/ncats-awards-palantir-technologies-inc-105900938.html) Almost no one is going to report task orders awarded under a single award IDIQ.

It's white noise dawg. Ignore it. Stonks only go up. China stonks are no different. BABA has the world e-market by the balls and China wants to make the most of that. BABA will comply with requests and life will continue. BABA is a $1000+ stock. It should be trading alongside SHOP and AMZN and everyone knows it but are too scared to capitalize on the opportunity.

Shortsqueeze says ratio is 5.6 days. But as OP's post states, there is a certain number of short shares that HAVE to be covered tomorrow since there have been more than 0.5% of the float that short sellers have failed to deliver on their naked shorts with minimum being 350kish shares. We have no idea how many short shares HAVE to be covered tomorrow, but with short share numbers at 90+% of the float, I'm expecting that number to be quite higher than 0.5%.
Maybe I meant fetal alcohol syndrome, I don't fucking know.
It’s all a scam so don’t worry
So you mean the same time stimulus will pass.

Very specific. Thank you. I mean this with only like 30% sarcasm.
Or it won’t... they don’t need president to pass bill
I would say hold
TLDR buy PLTR
Positive progress on solid state, but their battery tech is really not that impressive. I like the company but the share price is WAY too high:

- Tesla’s tech can already provide longer range than the 300 miles QS quote

- with supercharger availability, Tesla are expected to achieve ~10 min charge times to 80% full, by 2025. This compares against 15 mins to 80% quoted from QS.

- solid state batteries reduce fire risk but current tech is already exceedingly good at limited fire risk

- 800 cycle life is poor compared to 2000+ from Tesla

- QS say less than $30k EV, Tesla say $25k

- I haven’t seen any quoted production numbers, but Tesla’s battery strategy can at least ramp production exceedingly fast and cut costs in half by 2025, which is the real issue here. Finger in the air, I’d say Tesla produce 1000 times more batteries than QS in 2025 

EV batteries are already good enough, we just need them as cheap as possible and in large enough quantities to switch away from combustion engine vehicles and towards a green future asap. 

The key play in EV is who can mass produce batteries, we’re talking seriously massive production here. People who are betting on Tesla understand this aspect. The current QS share price implies they will be able to mass produce to the same degree of Tesla in 2025, using solid state technology I’d say that’s basically impossible.

I'm new to trading, but I think WSB has helped my development moreso than not (I take everything with a grain of salt), but it's a good community.  I've done well to have a trailing stop-loss.  I could regret the gains from the numerous times a stock jumped after being stopped out, but growth is growth.  And I would have sold PLTR if I was following my strategy of sell-at-5%-loss...  But i kept reading "diamond hand that shit", and I'm 4% past break-even.  

So I'm definitely still learning my tactics.  

But here's my thought, I could hold PLTR with my measly 88 shares and if it reached $100 a share in a year, that's an $8000 gain...   Or ideally, I could swing trade and hope for a 2% increase every week using whatever stock is trending up (re-investing all gains) and be up to almost $30000 in a year  (I'm currently using a 5,000 account).

I know sometimes you'll get a loss, but sometimes you'll get a jump beyond 2%, and if you have stop-losses to get you out if things go against you, then you'll be relatively safe.  

I don't make the kinda money it takes to constantly rebuild an account if I blow it up on options.

Am I retarded?
So you think CCP can and will destroy the company?
It's been forever since we've seen futures up more than 1%. Now it's either flat or barely up 0.2% most days.
About to?

Plus I’ll often do like 25-100 contracts. The most I ever did was 300 (the amount of calls, not the strike) SPY calls for .02 and sold them 5 minutes later for .04. Quick $600 profit / 100%. I don’t do that many at once usually though. Fees would kill me on something like that.
Jokes aside, if this truly smashes through $300, I'm gonna be half-way to the millionaire status (in my local currency, not in dollars... still, this makes my cock hard and my brain unable to think about anything else)
Even though I love it inexplicably no matter how many times i see this movie ending I still don't get it. This made more sense to me though.

Buffet strategy is optional. But if you like messing around gambling on stocks as a hobby, then I do think it’s worth gambling more at bottoms and looking for ways to taper at the top. 

So maybe you keep 80% of saving in stocks as a base strategy. Maybe go 100-200% when it feels like you are near the end of a bottom and go 60% after melt ups when everyone is euphoric and you think all the upside is priced in.
Incredible.

There are few, if any, comparable alternatives to their software - that's why they're used by [almost every major corporation/agency](https://web.archive.org/web/20201213230906/https://www.solarwinds.com/company/customers). Even if there were good alternatives, enterprise software migration is fucking expensive, and almost everyone will ultimately decide against doing so in favor of their own mitigations and assumptions that this won't happen twice.

Well you are a flamer
BABA ain't going away, but it's basically going to be an anchor on your portfolio for a year, maybe even two or three. This probe won't be the end of this. BABA will continue to get beat up for as long as the CCP wants it to get beat up. After Jack Ma is sufficiently raked through the coals and enough time has passed that most people forgot that he spoke out of the party line, then BABA will be off the hook and you might start to see the reversal of the longer-term downtrend.
Whatever, even if it is for selfish reasons he's still fighting the good fight. Everyone else was being a pussy about it
He doesnt care about losing his senate majority leader position?

Son, I just want you to know I’ve never been prouder of you than I am right now. So it’s all downhill from here, unfortunately.
I’ve heard this and having used my TD account as well as Webull and RH I can’t seem to tell the difference. Do your orders just fill faster ?TD seemed a bit faster but understanding how bid/ask works and always checking the bid/ask on all my options prior to buying and even watching it a bit to see how sensitive the Greeks have it I couldn’t say leaving RH permanently would change much for me but I don’t necessarily have a solid comparison either.

It is very hard for the average Chinese citizen to get their money out of the country to buy stocks in HK/US
Selling covered calls and puts to push my cost basis below NAV is basically my go to play. Its free money if you are patient.

The 22.50/20p spreads for June look like good money, but you could probably get 20/17.5 for like 0.75. Thats pretty much guaranteed to work if you don't mind waiting 6 months for 30%. 5% monthly Theta returns is pretty standard if you are playing it safe.

Edit: technically its 40%, which is quite reasonable for 6 month Theta plays. Because you get the premium right away, you are actually investing 175 to make 75, not 250.

shares at 260 avg.  cut losses and sell or hold?

You may not lose money in the long run, but you sure as hell lose a lot of time while you're bagholding those shares after they drop, and time=money.

Especially if there is a known catalyst in the near to medium future.  I can gradually get in waiting for increased volume

You can be the surrogate mother
I don't understand the drama, but this isn't the way to involve yourself.
I haven't used tastyworks platform but you will get better execution generally everywhere but robinhood so you spend the commission to save a decent amount. I use schwab and its .65c a contract but I get way better execution and limit order filling than robinhood. Its worth the commission. I regularly get fills below the midpoint for buys and above for sells

I just have to say though isn't WSB one giant fucking pump and dump?  GME, PLTR, GME, PLTR day after day after day after day.  NIO NIO NIO NIO.  And of course the queen daddy pump of them all TSLA.

Not too late. It’s going to break though levels of resistance all day. CCP isn’t done fucking Jack Ma over... this is why the stock has mooned since the IPO worse shit is yet to come for BABA.
Joe Biden is getting elected that's what's fuckin happening. He loves clean energy. ICLN is a clean energy purchase
You definitely seem to be the too lazy type. But good luck out there friend.
Dude it was the Hindenburg report. Chill
For those thinking of buying the Baba dip tmrw, during the the last drop resulting from the postponement of Ant IPO it bleeds for weeks so be careful out there. Coming from a Baba bag holder from the last ‘dip’.

Same here. Let my 170c run and couldn’t be happier.
Buy longer out. Lost my shirt on a 22c 1/15 I bought on a green day right before the shorts pushed it down from 19 to 13. Thing was fucking worthless until yesterday, when I sold at a damn gain.  

First actual option I bought was a week out, not over a month. Lost everything I put in that one. Buy long calls, sell before earnings, do not buy on up days however giddy you feel. Buy as low a break even price as is favorable. 

I think SPY is a stupid options target. It's an index. It moves sideways most of the time. Sideways loses you money if you're buying options. You want a low volatility stock you or someone else has done good research on. If it's a high volatility, buy after earnings. 

Low IV bullish stocks are MT for DD from here, and I say ZNGA from research from elsewhere. You could also check all the stocks ARK invest buys for volatility and long call those.
Sir, this is the unemployment line.

Yeah but they got a fucking lawsuit from the country for anti-monopoly. And this is China, they don’t take that lightly. Baba is stymied in their innovations and expansion by their own government. This shit isn’t done in a day. If you really believe leaps is the move, I would wait some more. Glhf

Shouldn’t it be the 28th? After it has been on the threshold list for 13 settlement sessions? The first date was the 8th. Gonna watch people buy up the 24th contracts and just fizzle out heh
I’m not sure you understand how margin works...
I would compare it more to a painkiller type of high. Will make you lazy and moody as fuck if you use it on the daily. Also, the worse side effect it had on me was the short term memory loss. Otherwise enjoyable without the harsh comedown if you space it out.
did you get fucked by a guy named greg?
Honestly if you do want to buy calls at least buy shares so you make some money!
So true!
Did Madoff release prospectuses and such? I remember watching a doc about it and this guy said it was really obvious the numbers were fraudulent and he called the SEC like 3 times but they didn’t care. ARK is up because everything she bought in January mooned.
What do you mean? Seems like the 2K checks amendment is going to pass in the House. Then it just has to get a handful of Republicans in the Senate (which is doable if there are some who would rather side with Trump than the GOP).
You don't have to exercise your right to buy them. Most people just sell the call option before it expires.
There’s an unbelievably intelligent thread over at the top of the M V I S subreddit right now arguing that today’s action was the result of illegal MM activity — and it seems correct.  To those of you who have done your DD on this company: we just got illegally fucked.  But, we just got illegally fucked so that somebody could get lower PPS.  Give it a read.  Big stuff is happening with this right now.

I’m approved for “The Works” on Tastyworks which is everything including futures and naked options. I keep RH around because it’s basically or almost all of that but no fees. I have Webull , TD and fidelity as well but I don’t use them much. This is great advice though. I do need a system. My big losses came early on. Since the last big one in September and a couple weeks ago I’m getting better at that part. Just ready to start the year off right and really grow my portfolio instead of making amazing gains and then flushing it down the toilet every time. Thank you for your time!

Nothing like risking life in prison to scalp a video game console.
25% rally on Tuesday, 5% rally on Wednesday. I have no idea if we rally a 3rd day in a row, but I am mentally prepared to see a big red day today. A lot of longs were selling yesterday actually, probably the ones that bought in at $4-5 price range, as $20+ is a 4x/5x for them, and I can't fault them for it - I'm hoping to 5x my position too at least. (231 shares @ 15.4)

It's totally possible we see a sideways day, with minuscule move up or down, just bouncing between $20-21 all day.

That said, I fucking hope this thing continues mooning to $24 tomorrow, even for a few brief minutes before getting pulled down by Melvin and BofA buying tens of thousands of puts and driving the price down to a halt.
Hey I’m new at this, just throwing around a bit I’m not afraid to lose in attempt to learn how this works

How the heck do I know what to buy tho
Why haven’t we created our own etf? WSB is a wonderful ticket. It can be an actively managed one and severely leveraged. We’d all make/lose money together
If you go to /r/undelete you can look at all of the posts and comments deleted by mods and bots.

It shows a mod is going super hard today banning and hiding loads of stuff.  Censorship revealed.

Or that's what the ~~lizard people~~ shorts want you to think!

Everyone was askin' "why is this such a big deal" no one thought anything of it, but then shorts saw a golden opportunity to close some of their positions. Ah yes, it's because of the good news, that's why the price went up like 60% in a minute. If you think about it, who the fuck would have bought so many shares solely based on the news that gme will get a minor cut from microsoft? The sentiment remained sceptic and bearisg all around, but smh the price shot up
IKR. Last couple of days it's gone up more than a dollar each day so a figured tomorrow it would be no different. If not, it's not a ton of money lost.

Ordered taco Bell on door dash, they messed up the order super bad. Spent about 15 minutes arguing with their text bot about getting a refund. Got support number, but the bot chat was still open. Argued with both the bot and the support guy about the refund ended up getting twice my orders worth in money back.   Buy puts, made 200% on ordering taco Bell through their app
Except it’s a 1:3 distribution
From wsbgod to this, this sub has to much drama for retards.

It doesn’t matter. It’s always a bulls delight
I agree all your point, only if there is law and order.  You have not factor in what happened to Huinan airline and other insurance companies, who stepped out of line.  Their boss disappear.  Also, their assets are sold cheaply to states owned enterprises.  I am not saying this is the script.  I am saying you did not state it.  PRC don’t care about what you think or the money it create.  It’s a matter of control and compliance.  Like the Joker. It’s about the message.  You have been warned

Shares I'd say go ahead but even leaps seem a little risky right now
So i only know about solid state batteries in depth. Aka the kind qs is making. What microvast is doing is something else that i have less knowledge of. All i can say about the experimental battery industry is that you should be wary. They can shill you snake oil - really good data with a shit battery pretty easy.  One of our favorite things to do in the lab was to rip apart world renowned researchers papers and talk about how they may have "embelleshed" their data or skewed in a way to make a shit sandwich look hot. 

In batteries the big hurdles will always be two things, developing new tech, and cobalt. Its hard to pick what tech will win (id bet solid state in like 2030). regardless, we need cobalt. And fun fact, its a mega conflict resource. Elon, apple, samsung, and the rest of the world turn a blind eye to the fact that its basically all mined with child labor. Not only this, but there's not really that much cobalt to mine. So where else can we get cobalt? By recycling. (Hint hint). Li ion recycling isnt very developed yet, but on a super long like 10 year time frame i could see it being a thing. Its in its infancy rn and is currently very expensive, but as the world runs out of cobalt it could become necessary. 

Also im retarded and none of this is financial advice
Keep it secret, keep it safe.

I don't disagree with your philosophical rambling. I support a family of 4 off less than 50k a year in one of the left coast cities, and we ain't paycheck to paycheck. And the part missing from your generational wealth definition is the knowledge that's also passed down. Generally speaking to get and stay ahead as working class you either have to be like the autists, or be born into a family that's passing down both wealth and the knowledge on how to keep/grow it. Without one of those two, you'll just keep getting poorer. It's a dichotomy I see with my wife and her boyfriend

Can't relate but my new year's resolution is to try and get a tesla stock every month
This
I just wheel the shit out of things and use premium to buy more calls and hedge with cheap debit spreads etc. My pltr graph has more lines on it than a than a junkies coffee table. 

Buy itm leaps and shares and sell calls on them, sell cash secured puts, you can still gamble. Use the premium to buy some otm debit spreads or 1dte calls or whatever. Buy a few puts to hedge when the stock is up, sell more calls when its down. 

Limit your upside and your risk on your bread and butter positions and gamble on others with profit. Dont buy or sell a shitload of things at once, leg into stuff and accumulated large positions over a few days etc.

Thats all I got. Goodluck 

 Best thing you can do is get a good program. Going from robinhood to thinkorswim or street smart edge is a crazy level up.

O yeah take 50% profit options you sell if they are aggressive deltas. Put in your limits everyday

Green at night...
she stated her minimum return target is 20%, but she sees her funds more than doubling in 2021, just youtube cathie wood genomic
I think he’d have more success making a mobile payment platform for secure purchases. Call it something like DollarDude or something
Instead of buying all of those retarded calls and puts start selling them to retards
I’m 3 years old
Now that you’ve surpassed it, will you keep working your day job or take your trading/investing more seriously?
So I have to admit I went today 🏳️‍🌈🐻today. This is gonna drop hard at some point in the next 2 weeks.  So went heavy UVXY 12c for 2/19.
Republicans are halting it in the house
It’s just so crazy seeing China literally drag baba out in front of the whole world and then decapitating and fucking the head like Jesus communism is no fucking joke
Can we really trust the advice of a man who's phone has more than a 2% charge?

can i fleet ur asshole 🤝💦
Anyone holding QS should sell their shares and sell puts instead. Holding QS shares when the puts are priced at nearly 50% of the underlying is retarded. QS upside from here is extremely limited, to double again they'd need to be worth around $100B. 

Not happening with a pre revenue company, don't care how retarded the market is.

Lol, I did this when RKT was getting pumped and bought RCKT as a joke.  I'm up 123%.
I don’t remember it in high school
I only have 53 shares at 26$ :( I want my stimmy money

Edit: you guys think my 12/24 35c will print?
Omg thank you for this

Loaded up on BABA calls last week and... IM NOT FUCKING SELLING
You can exercise options whenever you want if they're ITM.
Why
Not quite right. Not video game streaming like Twitch - the discussion is video game steaming like Google is doing. Who knows how successful that will be in the future though, pretty dependent on internet speed.
Nobody you fuck waffle
💩
The problem is they got pumped with an amazing business model, and since then they never released Any news haven’t done anything particular and left investors in the dark
Nah bro don’t do it. Baba in real trouble

Hear me out hear me out.

What if I curated an ETF called MEME and it’s the top 20 stocks on WSB, every week.

#This is a great idea! We won’t lose any money!
Classic joy ride
Haha! Thanks for the gift; I was blazed when I wrote it and was just being shitty because I thought it was poor information. Never thought I'd be so on the mark.
Why not post some puts or shut your cunt mouth? Infinity squeeze or not, there are shorts that will have to cover.
You’ve been all over these saying that it’s worthless when most are arguing for the value play.
They were warned repeatedly but refused to listen. Quite entertaining to watch the BABA bulls get rektttttt
You can go to /r/undelete and find everything that’s been removed by mods and bots.  Looking at WSB is kinda revealing.  


WSB on /r/undelete is the next WSB.   🙄
Ok and how was this accomplished, in detail please? I’m new. Like, calls? Puts? Shorts?
how many seedy dive bars does reddit really need?
Being balls deep in ICLN and the ARK’s is fun because you don’t go to bed thinking ‘I hope I’m green in the morning’ but instead ‘will I be green or HUGELY GREEN?’
Wow. Just got back home and saw my BABA play is absolutely over. China does not fuck around. RIP
How we feeling about our extra large fleet?
600+29 = 629, can't go wrong Dr Patel has got it on the dot
How can we pump gme so this guy gets even more rich?  Let's do it!
Amazing job bud. PLTR next?
S ame
This ^ Shitron for some goddamn reason has lots of influence on shorts (PLTR) and longs (luckin coffee). Even if this is a pump and dump, you’ll make solid money bois
I altered the deal. It was a pretty good deal. One of the bests actually. Reminds me of my book. A good book, everyone can tell you it is a nice book
[removed]
Welp, I’m in. Adding at market price at market open.

Edit- could be an interesting way to shake paper hands off tho. Price pops then when it starts to correct (paper hands selling) shorts hit it hard to drive it further down.
Will be interesting no matter what!
Yeah i sold 10 shares of it to buy 1 $12.50c and a $15c but currently they show as being down a few i think the prices haven't updated
🀄️SCRF is my gambling play
It’s crazy how little revenue PLUG makes after so many years. NIO is rolling in revenue like Apple by comparison
You can dick around in history and just live of Tesla Stock, as I plan on doing
Are you in BaBa?  What are your positions?
"Growth stocks in the S&P 500 have returned 31% including dividends, while value stocks are down 1%."

You would've done better parking your money in a high yield savings account than boomer stocks. Lmaooooooooo
When did you get in? Options on GME have been expensive as fuck. Stock could go up 10-20% in a week and people still miss the money.
bro X will become cyberpunk 2077
If you get back, you’re her bitch, and you’ll lose self respect

They don’t have to have sex. Also, Serena is married to the co-founder of Reddit.

My man
Gme puts
damn good write up, as much as i love the memes these posts are great lol. 

i’m definitely with you on baba tho, really like the company. i picked up a put option for the short term, & plan on buying shares once i take profit here✌🏻
Pleas mod again
yeah but we call them gay with love.  who could take anything seriously on this explosive diarrhea message board.
Yeah that maybe
BUY THE FEAR. SELL THE FOMO.

(BABA leaps tomorrow)
seems that way... there's cheaper one's on sites like wayfair but i cant tell what is garbage or not
Nice! Which ones did you get? I have a few weeklies ($7) and 12/31 $7s but primarily Jan 15 $10s which I'm holding.
I believe you.

if aapl has a nice dip tomorrow i might load up on my quarterly calls but feels too soon...
The problem isnt the expiration dates - you are just making bad trades. You need to find a system that works for you - and backtest it
This bear is about to feast on tendies for CRASHMAS!!!
PLUG, SBE and BLNK are all easy money.
I'm gonna throw all my xmas money into Tesla :D

At the time I had 300 shares. Bought 100 more when it dipped under $13, and another 50 on Monday. GME Gang
Damn my brain is going a million miles per hour. This covid shit has been giving me an existential crisis. It’s crazy how vulnerable human life really is. I just wish I was closer with my family in this present moment. 2021 goals I guess...if we even make it
Not suspicious at all

Feel free to elaborate. Who possesses a 15 minute to 80% full charge battery. NIO is making swap stations.

You're welcome.
I literally just bought 20 $21c for .6 expiring tomorrow. I'm really hoping for some fresh tendies.

Is market insider ded?
I'm fucking annoyed I dont have more money to breed money with. I've got 60 percent returns.... on a three thousand dollar investment.  If that shit were 40k investment, I'd have 60k. I'd have made actual money. 

Fucking annoying. I have to 10x just to make it to the starting line. Fucking fuck. 

I'm really damn hopeful for the pandemic end, though. Around March I should be able to build out a new business that's been on hold, and make a bunch of fucking money to feed to the money printing machine. Little late for the real GME squeeze - I've got 300 and am hoping for a red day tomorrow to buy another 400 or so, though, so. I'm putting my lunch money in the rocket machine! After I buy another MT call tomorrow.  

Red Christmas Eve, pretty please? Freak out about the stimmy bill or whatever, c mon. If you can also get me my 3 Tesla shares, I'd be thrilled.
I'm glad I'm eating my words on GME. I don't know how the fuck they're surviving COVID and non-existent console sales but they're doing their best.

Yeah NIO will acquire BABA soon at this rate 🤔
right!, both problems obviously solved by just yolo all in UTZ
We should breed Lebron and Serena Williams
The strikes aren't even up yet
I look to my left, i look to my right. I see QS pumping to infinity, i see XL about to do the same thing, even RMG is sneaking up there. Only fucking idiots wouldn’t play those and choose HYLN instead.

Well.. im one of those idiots.

On the real, any chance hyln goes to 30-40 soon..?

Ok I might be retarded but I am NOT a furry. I've ran the numbers, its not gonna happen coz no one has confidence in this shit stock, call it blockbuster 2, its a pyramid scheme and /u/deepfuckingvalue at the top of pyramid and played you all like fiddle, it will crash like titanic, so get in and out real quick at your own risk but safer to just avoid it

Just like the person commenting “oh if I had 3mil at 25 I’d just live off dividends !” - irony is that mentally is exactly what prevents anyone from age of 20 hitting 3mil. If you’re not taking risk with money you’re doing so with a business, a career choice, or regular lottos.

This stock isn't worth $15 let alone $30
Genius ? May I correct you :
*lucky retard 🍀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀 🚀
Best advice someone gave me early on was to get very well acquainted with [Trade Grid](https://i.imgur.com/suflIKY.png) on Thinkorswim - The PLTR price moves have a very uniquely recognizable [Ask/Bid](https://i.imgur.com/sXQXdpq.png) movement and pump pattern.  When you watch it long enough you'll start to pickup on when the money is present and when it's not and your stress level is greatly reduced.   I feel blind now when I watch or trade stocks without my grid showing me all the activity outside of the price itself.
It's not that odd of a chance considering the stock has gapped up double digit % two mornings in a row. Also consider if something bad happens you may end up holding the shares well past a point where you may have exited.

It's an attractive strategy with a good chance to beat normal gains on a company with high premiums but it's not fool proof. Especially if you can't afford to double your position or sustain a large price dip.
You get a footjob!! You get a footjob! You get a footjob!!!

D V A X is being squished by mods.

Went up 9% yesterday.. major press release yesterday as well.  Some retard on here told me it was gonna double ASAP. 

It was a RH reward for me. Did some DD, went in hard... 9% ain’t shit, but it might be the count down to blast off.  

Not too late since mods have been deleting everything and random ass accounts with literally ZERO previous comments or posts are jumping in to talk shit.
Or flooded with MMs making smooth brains the victims of their pump n dumps
Could also play the Buffett Diamond hand for life strategy. 

Pick any 2 date points on S&P500 15 years apart and try and show a loss, it’s not possible. 

Of course a black swan event can happen... 

But so can a meteor , super volcano, or zombie apocalypse. And catering a majority strategy to build an underground super bunker sounds retarded; just as a super conservative financial strat.
I need to stop buying options far OTM with less than two weeks before expiration. Also I need to just stay away from puts all together.
LMAO up 10% after hours. Say hi to the SEC for me
How do you people find this stuff?
Why is a Chinese company called Alibaba anyway? I demand a rebrand. Maybe it could be called Jackmama
How come the call options for XL are like that? Asking for a friend..

The lack of rocket emojis in this statement worries me a little bit but thanks for the opinion bud. $50 or higher would be awesome! Fingers crossed for all of us.

You're a ridiculous furry fucker and your brain is mathematically retarded.

Ah, so basically to avoid a sizable retrace, GME needs ridiculous momentum by the mid-January point.

BTW, thank you for all you're doing. You're doing good work, man.
I think BABA will be kicked out at some point in 2021

This is a delivery ORDER under an indefinite delivery contract that was awarded in September of this year: https://govtribe.com/award/federal-idv-award/indefinite-delivery-contract-75n95020d00016

Additionally, this order was published on 12/22. The 12/25 "award date" is essentially just when the new funding becomes available. If this was going to affect share price, it already would've - but anticipated contract events like this typically don't.
Market closing early today. Calls
Hedgefunds hate him.
Yeah, for us retards that no nothing, honestly what the fuk are leaps?
I hold BABA Jan 270 275 280. Feb 270 280. Dead? Do I hold a while to regain some value before selling? Do I hold my Mar 280 290?
So did vGAC but these contracts are hella expensive
I don't even get how those companies are supposed to save humanity. Electric cars, a subway for cars, and brain to computer connection? Maybe because space X has space exploration but NASA has done plenty on Mars without Elon.
Oh god, the SEC is gonna shut us down again

I understand the general concept of a squeeze - people who've shorted need to purchase the stock and cut their losses, driving the price up. But could someone please  ELIR(etarded)?

Does he make announcements during a certain time? Where would I see this info?
Ok, I concede that point. Still, perhaps we can agree that “just be clean/sober” and “just be rich” have a similar vibe in that they both are telling someone in a difficult and often complex situation to just fix it lol which isn’t effective advice
Bro that’s basic high school history
Jesus that was a stupid buy - then again, someone has to lose in this casino, better you than me.
The daily thread is cool, but, when all these Eastcoast clowns goto sleep it gets better.
Correct.

EDIT: anyone who disagrees, know that Citron, the king of shorts who tanks SPACs with a single tweet, has a $60 price target for XL Fleet.
4 shares at $21.56. it ain't much but it's honest work
I’m assuming you just slept through your high school history classes

I've been waiting for it. I expected it 60 grand ago.
Yeah I helped your dad tell them about you.

But fr, if you can't time your puts don't lose money buying them. Otherwise make those gains in record time, yes.
Apple is basically collaborating with NIO  in order to kick start their EV project. Apple has a history of collaborating with other companies. At this point, Apple doesn't have shit besides their overheating laptops and overpriced iphones with Samsung parts. One thing Apple is good at is outsourcing shit to China. I think NIO will come out as a bigger winner and this will help them bolster their brand even more. I'm also a bit more bias towards NIO since I'm balls deep.
Great, more good news.  Tomorrow's forecast = Red
no idea what that odte is, but yeah lol. i have one apple call for like 2021 or 22 but that’s it. rest are stonks

Really? Lol you must be pretty young
Cathie pleas
May the tendies be with you

i think they convert to stock if he's able to pay the call price
You're still very much alive on those. It's possible that this post is correct and the squeeze does initiate tomorrow, in which case those things will be a gold mine. It's also possible that even without a squeeze, the price will pump a little immediately at open and give you a brief window where you can dump those for around break even.

Personally what I would do is pray for a strong open and try to get rid of those about 5-10 minutes after open, and then immediately take that money and buy new contracts with a later expiration date. Unless the squeeze is very obviously happening (like +50% in the first few minutes), don't hold onto those longer than the first 10-15 minutes of trading.
Believe me I think it will, I'm just so hard into ICLN i can't throw that money around rn. Already 6k in stock for ARKG too. But end of December I'll prob send it
Stonks are closed, wut do u expect
Maybe Jabba The Hut

And for the retard retards in the west coast, that's 10 AM
Why deleted ? This was pure wsb DD
Well done retard!  Show positions!
Huh
I'll be buying shares. As for my current January, Feb, Mar calls... can't seem to decide. Jan 270 275 280 likely deceased, but do I hold on to salvage a bit before selling those
Let’s gooooooev
It's a weekly until Thursday. OP would have been way better off spending that 9k on the actual FDs. Watch it print.
Wtf
Easy mode will end soon.
F
BABA leaps will print
how do you do
Yep 25c. If it runs to 25 I’ll make 5k on 300$ 25k if it runs to 30.
it's better. during trading hours it's just 'MOONING' and 'DRILL TEAM SIX' spam

Yeah amazon been so flat it was crazy. I bought calls when it fell from 3500 though so I was kinda asking for it. Way too late to the party. Amazed it was dead all fall too though
Did he?
Rise Your PT setpoints it's going higher than that
This lowkey seems illegal but I’m not a lawyer lmao
The short answer is: 
So hedge funds make money. 

The long answer is: 

Hedge funds make money charging management fees. 

Clients pay management fees. 

It’s easier to explain why you underperformed against S&P500 by 8% than show a 8% loss. Even tho mathematically it’s same. 

Clients are prone to emotional swings, so they don’t see Penny less earned == Penny lost. 

Clients contribute to AUM 

If clients are unhappy they leave hedge funds. 

Hedge funds make money based on % of AUM.

If clients leave, hedge funds can’t collect % of AUM. 


Hedge funds aren’t incentivized to maximize returns. 

Just a large enough return such that institutional investors see it’s a significant benefit over bonds, and that volatility is low such that the rough net worth has a low standard deviation. 

Therefore whatever strategy that yields maximum consistent gains whilst minimizing loss attracts most AUM. 

Therefore hedge funds make Max profits.

Next time I’ll do call spread.
AMAZON HAS SO MANY MORE THAN 175 warehouses. Nvm I’m a jackass
Absolute facts what fucking a holes
this isnt a small issue.  Xi views what baba as a threat to the CCP. He is going to make an example out of him. It's not an eye for an eye. It's drag you through the streets for a year and make sure you beg for forgiveness. On top of that you have the US also fucking with asian equities through the audit stuff. Baba will recover but I don't think this is the bottom.

GME retards hate when anyone brings up the blockbuster scenario. The reason they do is multi fold. 

1. History repeats itself and some of us are trying to warn you.

2. Both were engaged in the  brick and mortar selling/renting of used media disks/cartridges. GME also sells consoles just like BB sold popcorn and candy and videogames too if I recall. 

3. Both were leaders in their dying industry with little competition. BB had hollywood video and independent stores, GME  has digital sales and walmart as competition. 

4. Both are/were run by complete fucking jokes of CEOs.

5. Both had  heavenly intervention where things could have turned around . For BB it was when Reed Hastings tried to get them to buy or at least invest in Netflix, the  BB CEO threw him out, then after the meeting they tried to launch a copycat service.  GME has Ryan Cohen offering to transform the company and buying up shares only to be rebuffed by the CEO/board which are willing to devalue and take a poison pill rather then try to change.

6. Both have  tried to branch out since Brick and mortar is expensive and dying. GME made a deal for a % of digital sells from MS, and is thinking of selling computer parts?? Like Best buy and Newegg don't exist. While Blockbuster started their Netflix clone I think it was called Blockbuster Direct or Connect or something like that, they also started selling videogames, music and old used stock, they would have sold you the movie promo displays if they could have made any money doing it.

7. They both got hit with massive reduction in B&M  Sales for different reasons. With GME it was mostly COVID, Indoor malls during the Holiday season is just asking to get sued for anything that goes wrong. Blockbusters Covid was called the Internet/Bootlegs/torrents/redbox, none of which had late fees (remember those) you got charged for not returning stuff on time, sometimes multiple x  the amount of the rental for one day late.

8. It's a slow decline but it is declining. Blockbuster held on for years, there is still even  one store in Bend OR. But paying mall rents and teenagers getting $15 an hour to work a cash register while other sellers don't have these expenses is just not sustainable in the long run, unless there is high traffic, which there is not, and your marquee product is in low supply and has low margins even if you can sell it.

9. You are betting what seems like large amounts on two things:
 A. That cohen wrests control from the jackasses currently in charge. Or the Short Squeeze saves you. Which 90+% of you haveprobably never been involved in a big infinity squeeze . Good luck trying to not be left holding bags.
Or catching those knives. I'm pretty aumm my

I've done CCs on GME 3 times in a month. Once at earnings and twice last week in the same week. Doubled my shares on margin so I wouldn't miss the ride up and still whiffed on about .60 of gains including premiums.

I think if you're getting crazy high IV premium rates it's worth considering. But it's very easy to miss the boat. If anything be prepared to double down on your shares after hours.

It's retarded that people here are offering ideas for improvement when this whole thing was prompted by a great mod that had to step aside. Those ideas won't be fully embraced until the drivers of this sub set their priorities straight (or gay, whatever) and align them with us, the people that just want to make some money or have fun trying.
Everything depends on the person obviously.  Some people just aren't smart enough to get a good job.  Any idiot can just not shoot drugs into his arm.  They ain't the same.

As a true retard, that was my first options trade,  I didn't even know what ITM, or OTM stood for. Glad I spoke to someone and he helped me close to sell 4 contracts at 29.90.  I was happy to walk away with only a grand out of pocket, true autism.  I think I didn't sleep for three days.  Monday morning when I got out, I felt I was handed my life back.  I honestly haven't felt more excitement, worry, or doubt in my entire life.  Now, life is just boring,  deactivated options,now I'm buying gay 🐻 stocks.  Have to figure out where you guys learned the ways of the force, and get with a Yoda.  This is the way.

I mean if someone has an addiction on a physiological level just telling them to stop (1) isn’t effective or helpful and (2) ignorant of the actual difficulty of quitting a habit like that. Idk, maybe you or the guy who posted that comment have had worse addictions than mine and beat them - my point is every person has their vices and every person and their vices are different. Let’s not pretend “just stop it” is effective advice lol. And I’m saying this as someone who was eventually able to “just stop it”
With stocks, yes. I suppose its easier to doodle on charts than do some research on the company itself.

I have zero skin in GME but goddamit I’m rooting for the bulls like crazy! Fuck that hedge fund!
any cheap potential 10 bagger positions ?
Yea anything that can give 1500% gain could push you to 0% 15x faster.
it's literally been buy anywhere on red, even on a terrible entry and you get bailed out by the market less than 24 hours later for days and days and days.

there have been so many v-recoveries in the last couple weeks on all 
the indices that it seems like we're in less "retail is buying every dip" territory and more "institutions are training retail to buy every dip so when the drawdown comes they'll be sure to have buyers every step of the dump" territory.
Does your broker automatically calculate this cost basis reduction or do you have to keep track of it yourself in a spreadsheet?
I’m sure the SEC would have no problems with that. Nor would it lead to a MLM type set up where early players make bank and late joiners get left holding bags.
Seeing the GME gang's success is like watching a low-ranked team have one of those Cinderella story runs through the March Madness tournament.

I have nothing at stake and no allegiance to any of it, but I can't not cheer for you guys.
Largest SPAC deal ever. It's similar to RKT without the bad juju. I'm giving it a short term $20 PT on low end based on RKT and sheer size. They had $1.45B net income in Q3 btw.
My great great great grandparents went to all the trouble of leaving Sweden (for some reason) just to come to the USA and settle in Wisconsin because it reminded them of home, what with all the swedes and cold weather.
I played a $1 slot 25 times, lost every time and thought "fuck this is dumb". I'm pretty sure slots are for old people to tinker while they drink.
The X kills Elon, the workers become the custodians of humanity
LEAPs and selling weeklies against LEAPs
Then what the fuck is the point of hedge? Even if we get a bear market now and made more then they did in 5 years
That's a terrible answer though. It's written like some kind of legalese CYA non-answer. I feel like it's only in there because the SEC can't openly admit that this regulation absolutely can impact the market, even though that isn't the intent of it.

It's not even a "no", they just say "not necessarily". Then they give absolutely no explanation or justification as to why a close out purchase wouldn't drive up the price of a stock other than "cuz that would be illegal!". Supply and demand doesn't suddenly stop existing just because the SEC said so.

Close out purchases might not have a *significant* effect on the price of a stock, depending on the size of the fail to deliver position being closed and the market conditions of that day.  But closing out a short-position by buying shares is going to put at least some degree of buying pressure on the market whether it was a mandated close out or not.

The significance of the 13 day deadline coming tomorrow is really going to depend on just how large the fail to deliver position actually is, which AFAIK there's no way for us to know. If it's a gigantic position though then this totally could drive the price up.
I use both. Both are great. Stocktwits is the best I've seen for following crowdsourced info. Which admittedly isn't always reliable. But its a great resource for breaking leads too.

I would argue that depends on the person. I put myself through a top 10 school and eventually landed an office job at a huge manufacturing company and get paid well.

I don't know, stocks can go up or down. Anything is possible, but I hope Tesla branches out more. For example, acquire a genome research company and create electric super soldiers. Or put up more satellites and add orbital bombardment capabilities. Maybe acquire Palantir and along with the satellites, create actual Skynet.
i don't know what part of "zero fucking plan" is confusing; i haven't predetermined anything. they're up 40 something % after the bell today. they were down 50 something % in september. i'm betting on them being worth a lot more closer to 2022. *bet*, key word. fuck strategies and theories.

Options are like elevators. Some go up to the top and some go down. The only choice you have to make is which elevator to stand in.
The problem with playing BABA is 1. how long do you really want to tie your money up in it waiting for it to recover???  because I've been waiting almost 2 months.  2.  loser stocks often lose for a reason.  recovery plays are tempting, but it's often better to just find a winner that's winning.  how are those people playing the Intel recovery doing?  3.  The Chinese government is not fucking around anymore.  There has been a true shift of power there and China is now a super power.

People are adding positions even today. I own NIO too and their 150kW battery is coming. But this technology/process with solving dendrites could be used with cheaper non lithium alloys. The 15 minute high cycle properties make solar panel technology duty cycles much higher and efficient. The market isn't ignoring this. 

Its more than Bill Gates and Volkswagen. Look at DraftKings and other mediocre zero cashflow business models hold their value. This is the soul of the EV vehicle. The power source to Iron Man's suit. The technology to end the oil monopoly and the cure for our atmosphere. 

Moderna walked the same road of doubt and non believers. 

There's something in QS, an ace in their sleeves. The technology works, they will produce these sooner than they are letting on.

It's going to be a wild ride, but will end happily ever after. Another black budget breakthrough gifted to the commercial market. These advances have fuelled three decades of bull markets and preserved Americas dominance and reserve currency status.

So what is DeepFuckingValues story about why he first invested and held on for so long?

And where does he see GME going? I’d love to know if he’s riding this short selling boat to the moon also or if he is planning to cash out
At least it has actual sick profits and margins rather than companies selling you a dream like QS with no actual sellable product and revenue lmfao.
Bumps is the bathroom while leaving the sink running.
I'm going to say it.
the question isn't will BABA come back.  its WHEN???  Because I've held this piece of shit for 2 months now when I could have used the money for so many other plays.  Should someone really tie up their cash now and then hold it in BABA for at least the next 6 weeks before you see any life come back?

You realize you can lose your shirt your pants and your fuckin car with shares too right? You know these retards are on margin.
JPM price target is currently under $90 I believe.

RIP to calls <1 month out. But 3+ months are fine. A lot of funds and institutions own BABA and aren’t going to let it suffer long term. The dust will settle in January and the run back to 300 will begin. I plan to just chill and come back in a month and re-evaluate. I plan on selling at break even but should be fine. Lesson learned don’t touch Chinese stocks for options, buy stock

There is also sketchiness
Don't go far OTM on your options ever and buy very close to ITM options only after the morning drop finds the floor.  Take PROFITS on weeklies and play the news as it comes.   You know the whales are underneath having a field day with retail so don't diamond hand anything or it will turn to dust at next morning bell.   I start trimming profit at [about 90%](https://imgur.com/a/dyJQa9e) on my PLTR options.

People usually do this so that the shares can’t be shorted. You put in a sell order for a stupid high price and those shares aren’t allowed to be be lent out to shorts by your broker. Now you don’t need to place a sell order for $199k to achieve this but that’s what I assume is being done here.

I'm new. So because they're ITM it will convert to stocks? And normally when a call expires you lose the money and thus have to sell before it expires?

Maybe because of trump’s veto
Good to know. And random question but what do our flairs mean?
Buy and hold. Can’t lose if you don’t sell. Until expiration lol
I think so as well. Earnings will be good and I think dust will settle in January. A lot of funds and institutions own Baba and they aren’t gonna make it drop. This is all politics show at the moment. Weekly calls are fucked but I think 3+ months out are fine

Had to fucking work on Christmas last year. Luckily this year things lined up for me to have Eve and day off.

Just buy leaps to give more time for acquisition.
Well if you look at the market cap of QS pre-merger when it was KCAC then it was probably close to where RMG is now. Their charts do resemble one another so there's a chance they could be priced similarly post-merger. Plus who knows RMG may break news like QS and have even better technology so we will see.

This is the wrong sub to get philosophical on, but the best things in life are free. People making $200k/year find ways to live paycheck to paycheck. Spoiling your kids won’t make them better off either. Happiness is a choice, teach them that. The people making millions are either lucky or doing things you wouldn’t be willing to do.

As a long term investor and trader, I can tell the OP has good intention and most of his points are valid, especially for new investors and traders. I don't agree with the part he said selling GME for 5% gain. Seems to me, GME is a long term buy and hold investment.

Everyone kept spamming QQQJ Jun 35 in the daily over the weekend. "QQQJ is free money. Next big thing. All in student loans into QQQJ."

They crowded the trade instantly with market orders in the AM. Check how much higher the contracts traded for on Mon even though QQQJ was down (from like 1.05 to 1.65! wtf!).

Boom, they killed the 35s instantly as a good directional play as price would have to increase sufficiently rapidly or price and IV would need to continue to expand simultaneously for the 35s to be profitable.

Pay it forward. Good luck!

No drop still. I guess you're still on your first one freebie. 🤣
my understanding is when calls are added to open interest that means someone bought the calls from someone else who sold the calls and hence there is a contract although this contract is open because it hasn't been closed or executed. Am I missing something?

It's not going to dip tomorrow. Just throw 30k at open if you're going to do it because there is a very real chance that the squeeze will happen tomorrow and if you aren't in the moment the market opens, you'll miss it. Not saying that the squeeze is totally for sure going to happen tomorrow, but it's probably the most likely day we've had for it to start so far.

I started frequenting this sub in Feb/March when we were all gay bears and laughing at "the beer virus."  I was first here for the laughs and memes.  I then realized that there is A LOT of information here.  Both great and awful.  You have to figure out for yourself what you want to follow and trust.  I've decided to throw "fundamentals" away because this market is 1000% fully retarded.  Things are trading on sentiment and hope.  You'll find some tickers constantly mentioned and a lot of that is based on survivorship bias (Bullish on: GME, PLTR, TSLA, the ARK etfs, CROX, CRSR, DKNG, NIO, LI, XPEV) (Bearish on: NKLA, DASH).  

Pick something and do some research on it.  Compare and contrast what you find against WSB.  Right now, I'm 1000% full retard bullish on GME.  [Check out this GME stock vs. console cycle chart](https://thecollective.finance/2020/10/gamestop-gme-a-squeeze-to-44-from-14-can-be-justified-fundamentally-100-of-the-shares-are-short-watch-out/).  "Past performance isn't an indicator of future performance" but that's all anyone has to go on.  There's a very good argument to be made that GME will shoot up after Q4 2020 earnings (which is expected to be 3/24/2021) based on just the new console cycle.  Add that to the short interest (over 100%) you can understand why everyone is going crazy on GME.

Decide how much risk you want to take on.  Decide on your time frame.  Are you looking to find a lottery ticket in 1 week/1 month?  Or are you looking to make more modest but safer gains over a few months?  I lost almost 5k in the beginning because I didn't understand options (the greeks) and weeklies.  I don't do weeklies anymore - too much risk for me.  Now I only buy options OTM (but within 10-20%) at least 1 month out.  My gains won't be as insane as some of the screenshots you see here but I'm not going to lose 5,10,20k in 1 week.  All you need is for your account to keep going up, the speed isn't all that important.  Don't let 1 red day wipes out your entire account.  

Currently I'm really invested and long on PLTR (mix of shares and calls for 1/2021, 3/2021).  Also long on weed stocks, the safest way to play weed is with the "MJ" etf.  Long on NIO because of their battery as a service (BaaS).  "Long" on GME of a few months; I'll sell and not look back after the short squeeze.  

Some longer (later 2021 and 2022) safe investments would be stocks that have been beaten up by COVID.  Stuff like: AAL, UAL, PK, CNK, and other travel/hotel/retail stocks.  Again, this is all based on your time frame.

haha why would I listen to your stupid ass now as you double down on your wrong statement. I had 200% gain on shares since this comment. RETARD.
I just see no value in it now. It’s kind of similar to how the perceived value of sports diminishes as you age.

When you’re young it’s beneficial to have ambiguous exercise like that — spending energy very broadly, whether that’s mentally in a video game or physically in a sport, promotes growth and development.

Once you mature though and no longer need the larger more ambiguous energy spending to develop, you refine your focus to the things that generate the best return on your time. Like thinking about or working on a work project or doing DD on a play you are thinking about making.

There just isn’t the same benefit to you as an adult so your interest fades.

If both these goals are achieved in the next year or two, I will probably put 80% in some "safe" ETFs and use the rest to keep listening to WSB.
Because of all you retards, goal 1 is nearly achieved!
Bro it's still fine here just give us back daily discussion.

Ya not many people realize how impossible it becomes to detach from a data platform once you are integrated on it.

Yep. That’s what he’s proposing. Not sure the current board would go this route. Cohen might. But judging by chewy he really likes a sharp focus. To me GameStop should only do gaming related hardware. So TVs, soundbar, headphones, etc and draw the line at allowing anything else

I once thought a $30 squeeze was the goal, but after RC upped his stake I’ve now leaned toward $30 being conservative. Either way, I’m going to stay in but take profits when I feel gooddddddd
good luck, I was prepared for this to dip TODAY, but it went 12%+ at some point, before being pushed down to 6% buy those sleazy put buyers. I think this might actually moon tomorrow again, especially if Cohen reveals more share buying this week.

Why wouldn't he just buy more shares when it was $15 if that's what he wanted? Why does he need more shares? Doesn't he already have enough that even if they go through with the dilution they mentioned in their earnings report he'd still be above 10%? 

I think Cohen wants the stock to improve. He doesn't have any incentive to drive it down?

I have a small, less than 5% position in BABA in my retirement account.  While this is obviously not good news, I am a long term holder and I’ll probably pick a bit more up after it crashes in the US market.   In the long run, this is still going to be a good growth stock.

I think it’s bit of both and some faith. 
If you look at returns from indexes YoY and multiply that by a factor of 1.5-2, it’s possible to do that consistently. But then we are talking profit taking, balanced portfolio, choosing the entry points, keeping a cash position ( even though a lot of people would tell you it’s not worth it) etc. 

On the other hand, 5x and 10x growth is more luck. Buy cheap and hold. Sometimes, it will play out. Nio for example was dubbed a failure till the beginning of this year. Sure, you can find growth opportunities if you spend enough time but even then it’s hard to predict fast it can grow. 

In addition, all the people who give anecdotal references to Amazon, Apple, FB etc., that’s more like faith. All of these companies have pivoted and branched out quite a lot from what they initially started out doing. Some of their product/services could did not even exist 10 years ago.
Why? They didn't cause it. They contained it as best they could. At most you could probably say they should have been more transparent and people lower down the chain should be reprimanded for trying to hide the outbreak initially. The Chinese government didn't cover it up, some low level Chinese government officials tried to hide it from their higher ups which then had to come in and fix their mess.

China then went on to manufacture and distribute PPE, respirators and other key equipment. Sending it to Europe and other smaller countries that needed the aid.

Don't get me wrong. We should hate the Chinese government for many atrocities they have committed against racial minorities, quelling dissent and generally being authoritarian cunts but this isn't their fault and making this the thing you go after them for cheapens the pain and suffering of those that really got fucked by China.

Everything I have ends January. It’s not feeling very secure lately.

2:30 is where the correction talk starts, I assume they're referring to her comments around 3:20 though.
Merry Christmas.
Sell for sure, what’s the premium on them?
Any analyst that claims high certainty with near term shit is a shill. But EOY I’d point toward mid/high $20s, and we retrace to this level or lower after management’s ICR & holiday sales report (Jan 13th & 12th), but that dip will, like they all have been by this activist & theirs, bought.
G Spot baby
What was that boner toward the end?
This regulation is no joke. Squeeze or not. There are huge penalties at stake if they don't cover.
I really think Jack Ma just needs to let Pooh Bear save face by publicly apologizing. That's it
So..... Does this mean MT will still win bigly?

You can do it yourself. 

Step 1: Make 2nd brokerage account (Webull or something also free).

Step 2: Purchase options

Step 3: Generate random password, use a scheduled email send feature to send you your password on a specific date to your email address.

Step 4: Login and sell at that time.

&#x200B;

Only use that brokerage for options you truly wanna diamond hand

RC buying more might be the actual catalyst and I think he might file those tomorrow. Someone has been buying a ton of shares this week, I suspect it's him expanding his position, just like he did last week.

Partnership in a sense of collaboration. Apple doesn't have shit besides their overheating laptops. If Apple is seriously taking on this project of building EV, they need to collaborate with another EV company and NIO has the resources in terms of autonomous software. In addition, NIO and Apple software engineers have been playing music chairs. One thing Apple is good at is outsourcing shit to China and collaborating with other brands. I'm trying to keep this as simple as possible; therefore, there is no need to overcomplicate. Overall, will be seeing every side of the moon in a short term.
Please explain how?

According to some dudes long ass dd post. GME short squeeze happening tomorrow! Target $30. Take it with a grain of salt but holy shit am I hard as fuck.
I haven't been following the BABA thing very closely - is it a great opp. to buy in cheap, or something to be legit concerned about?

IV still counts against you over the weekend. And this one will be a day and half longer. Now, I absolutely have ICLN calls I plan to hold over the weekend. So that’s two reasons why you should wait until Monday
20k ain't going to get you something dope
Still quite the feat!
That's their own dumb-ass fault for investing in something because it's located geographically near to them. Doesn't mean other people can't make money off the stock

Any good EOY contracts I can load up tomorrow? looking for nice gainers
Don't put too much weight on this theory, the amount of shares that will have to be covered tomorrow are a drop in the bucket, they may push the price up a few tens of a cent, but I doubt we see a 40% day.

I'm long as fuck on GME and I think this is a multibagger play, but give it some time, you won't double your money overnight or in a week, unless you luck out with some retarded FD or whatever...

Oh snap, 🐢v2 🚀🚀🚀
Lol apple has been saying they are going to get rid of Intel for 30 years, nothing new.  FB and Amazon said the same shit like msft yet they still sucking the tit of Bob Swan like msft will continue to.
Yep RH doesn't have 0DTE so I'm going next week exp, as far OTM as possible and as many as I can lol if nothing happens, I may sell them tomorrow or hold til at least Monday.

Eternal september is here to stay, sorry for your loss.
You code each sale in each state as taxable or not and then the invoice separately charges for sales tax based on your answer or requires exemption certificate from buyer.

I understand the first one, 50% loss so at the very least you can scrounge up what little dignity you had left. But goddamn dude, you were down near 90% on the second one, just let that one go to expiry and hope for some hail mary.
Well I also buy high 😂😂. I never sell (which could be an issue).

I looked at it REAL hard a few weeks ago and I just can't see it recovering, as you say. The Apple M1 and recent AMD chips are a thorn but the real killer is things like the Ampere Altra and other ARM offerings on the server side. They'll hold on for decades yet but the peak has passed unless something really dramatically changes.

I made a mistake
You were thinking that hedging and diversifying instead of putting all your money in one stock was a good idea, which it was. Putting all your liquidity in GME would be retarded. It might work but it's still retarded.

I shorted the market in February and bought quarantine stocks that kept going down for 2 weeks while the market kept going up. I figured I must be in a fake news bubble and markets know America will handle this. If the market had just woken up a week earlier I’d be retired, instead I ended up with most of the losses as everyone else. (I got back in fairly quickly.)

So when are you going to act? Everyday the news tells you the sky is falling. When you see the sky falling and the market doesn’t, Will you believe it?
I read it. But you didn’t tell us what to do. What a waste of time. Don’t just scream “fix it”. What do you want us to do man?!

We everywhere bro! Cathie for POTUS
Anything in life is a gamble in one way or another. Some gambles the odds are just in your favor. If you do your research and your due diligence properly in your stocks you can move the odds to your ballpark. The good thing with investing (as in, not options) is that as long as you’re not investing in a BS company and let’s say you have a red day and lose money, you can literally just wait for the stock to come back up again and you’ll make back a profit.

Why don’t we just make our own subreddit and look for mods?
bitch i’m trying to get rich by market close tomorrow
how i'm gonna play it is all or nothing, every option that's worth less than 5 cents typically drops to 0 bid as the trading day goes on in this stonk (iv'e held a lot of calls to expire worthless lmfao). i'm just gonna find something trading for 2 or 3 cents max with a bid of at least 1 cent and just jam 69 contracts, maybe at 2 strikes depending.
Solution imo: flair things should say how long people been in the sub. Times with big influx of noobs should have limits on them commenting or posting. New people should not be allowed to comment more than once or twice in a day - most of them dont trade and just copy paste basic comments. Its like the actual retards of reddit who go around making a pyramid of "nice nice nice" comments for years on end.

Yea those 2 I agree 100% will never even come close to their ATH. Intel still looks like it has a shot but I think they just threw away their future this past year, especially with AMD/NVDA's growth + now MSFT/AAPL don't need them like before.

I lived in my car last year and am now a millionaire but was hit with depression for the first time in my life. Don't know where it came from, don't know if was from the lockdown restrictions or from realizing that money doesn't equal happiness. I feel as if I am on the other side of this now and climbing my way back to my normal self. Hopefully from this new low I will see new highs. Scary year internally though, holy fuck.

We may have propped it up a bit pre earnings but none of this spike is from our 5%. Hence my point that we can’t move the market as our 5% didn’t do much. Unless you are telling me we need a recount and we now have 15%+ which I couldn’t imagine

People have flawed definitions.
“Gambling” and “Investing” are the same, the only difference is as follows:
Most people seem to be hedging against negative outcome-based narratives. That is often why someone will go with the conventional route on something because if it goes bad, they have a “rational” decision-making paradigm they can point to as an excuse:
Conventional winner= smart ✅ 
Unconventional winner= genius ✅ 
Conventional loser= unlucky ✅ 
Unconventional loser= foolish gambler ❌

Brexit deal huge upside for GME
I wish the market was open the second half of the day so I could sleep in.
My portfolio went down almost 35% man 

Gains I already paid taxes on were  gone 


I went from parting at the highest roof hotels 

To googling what is the highest bridge 🌉 “ near me “ 


And just like that 

It was all over and I now worried about paying taxes all my massive big cock Tesla and square gains
Currently they only have a dividend of $0.01 per quarter.
That means I'm only missing out on $8 at current rate.
Until there is change to the dividend, they don't matter to me.
I'm expecting an economic relief package for REITs in the early months 
 of 2021 which should trigger a serious rotation and price spike.
The IV is also extremely low which would be a great improvement as well.

For several reasons. 

Their carbon capture program alone is going to be huge as xom and companies like it are held to account for their carbon footprints. 

Their doe deals. 

Their plant in Long Beach CA for Toyota is fucking gonna be sick. 

And with the new stim package all the companies that invest in their company for any of the above get to write a good portion off with the tax incentives. 

And that’s before we roll out the Paris climate agreement funding. 

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg...

So yeah. FCEL is a winner.
That’s good reason to buy more shares
Ur wife aint what she used to be either but ur wifes boyfriend ain't complaining 🤪 😏
Yes. Gambling actually requires skill, or you are poor. 

If you aren't convinced of your own genius, trade shares instead of options. That's not skill or gambling, that's just research and having a spine.

Thank you for sharing. I hate myself less for selling my 200 PIC shares on Monday.
I'm assuming they're going to use the Tesla ticker.
> My XOM is invested through Roth IRA accounts, not directly purchased, and it is not set up to automatically reinvest dividends. I manually reinvest the dividends, mostly into XOM while the yield is high.

Now that's smaht boomer thinking there. Invest in a loser while it's cheap. 

> You really do have accurate flair! Tesla's market cap is greater than all of the other car companies combined, their P/E is north of 1,200, and they don't sell all that many cars. 

LOL Buick. Oh gramps. How far can your Buick drive without driver intervention? Now compare that to Apple or Tesla. 

Your slow expensive tech that shits all over our air is no match for the future.

Also if you work for XOM -- just fyi -- your little play for hydrogen that you thought you could crack from methane to maintain your dinojuice market is fucking failing. You can't prop up shit pies like NKLA forever.

it was the night before Christmas eve,
Autists with yolos and retards with fds,
All eyes open or shut dreaming of the squeeze.

The market makers and their bears galore,
Conniving, and plotting, for gore.
Yet little did they know, where the market was going to go.

The ticker ticked as the clock tocked til signal alerts shot.
RSI overextended, the volume insane, all the tendies all the gains.
The dumbest play said by boomers and the pros the same,
Had turned all the autists and retards into winners of the Gme.

Markets definitely need a pull back, especially small caps but I don't know what the catalyst will be.

And DRIPS too!

And you call me autistic? Dude, look in the mirror! You can't surf a crashing wave!

I LOVE the part about XOM has got some of the smartest managers!

Here's a quiz -- what does a smart manager do when his business model is either a) going to end due to peak oil, or b) going to be reduced due to increasing emissions controls:

a) funds disinformation campaigns and online PR bullshit by fucktards

b) funds climate change denial groups by other fucktards

c) makes political donations to forestall the inevitable to fucktards

d) works on transitioning in 1982 to massive buyouts and investments in high tech and R&D

Make a wild guess.

God damn -- "smart managers!" Well I'm going to bed smiling tonight! You couldn't have invested in a dumber bunch of thugs, dopes, ninnies and nincompoops if you had given the money to a street preacher or a church.

Maybe, but designing and mass production on a messed up musk timeline are two very different things.

When the news is out that Ryan increased position from 10% to 13%, the possibility of short squeeze increased to 90%. Selling covered Calls after that news is wrong.

**If a stock has a slim chance of short squeeze, don't sell covered calls.** 

**If there is a good chance of short squeeze, DON'T SELL COVERED CALLS.** 

In June 2019 people sold TSLA covered LEAP calls for pennies. Now those calls worth millions. I know this from positive first hand experience.

Having said that, you might end up collecting $2k for free. That doesn't mean selling CC was the right move.

Guess it’s back to wading through the cesspool that is /biz. At least smg is pretty active for a bunch of 17 yr olds.
Did you or did you not bust a fat nut when FCEL hit $10?
The BATs are not immune though. They are doing this out in the open exactly because negotiations in the backrooms broke down and open warfare is their last resort.

If Alibaba, and especially Ma, try to keep fighting then I see no reason why China shouldn't just say fuck it. Especially since these big companies growing at their current pace are a giant problem to the power structure. Theyd rather have ten big companies instead of 3 large ones.

And doing serious damage to one company will set a precedent and get many of the others to toe the line.
Lol this guy thinking we’re reporting gains on our taxes and not getting a $3,000 deductible
Stayed in my lane and up $100k on being long GME. Thanks for being so retarded!
Chunk
You tell me narc
The NAV is just based on the market prices of the underlying stocks owned in the ETF. Those stocks are going up cause ARK is buying them. And ARK is buying them cause she keeps getting new clients plowing money into her ETF and she has to invest that money lol. In conclusion, a lot of this is liquidity driven and based on massive inflows of money into her funds - which is well deserved I guess given her track record and performance this year.
Tbh those companies won't get bought out. Just like the GoPro you'll find lidars become cheap asf and plentiful in the next two years
I feel like you’re a dude I can hang with. Good luck out there friend - strikes and gutters, you know.
Fuck poor people for needing to pay rent? 

I don't know what their point is. Especially since the poor person pays the 600 to real people who actually make things. Rich people pay banks to try to make more money via gambling. 

Poor person's dollar accomplishes more. Maybe if you invest in risky companies that need their stock for financing and are working to change the world, then you're on par with a poor person spending their money for a material good they really need that improves their lives and allows the people they pay to continue paying rent and selling useful products.

They dont need him for a model 3 ramp up tho, just to get off the ground. Anyone expecting them to compete with tesla in 2024 is also dreaming. What they have a fair shot at is edging into the market and producing something that can compete with the brand name auto makers that are shifting into EV. 

Tesla will still be the dominate EV company in terms of future possibility and current value. If Apple can produce even an average EV with a polished design, Apple software integration, and some light self driving capabilities then they're golden in pulling bits of market share from the likes of Ford, Honda, etc. 

There is significant evidence of investment into the self driving and battery space, what probably really holding them back is the physical car.
Wait a minute..

Your example doesn’t make sense.  Why would you buy a deep ITM call on a reit and miss the dividend especially when the cost of your leap is essentially the same as buying shares on margin?

You really want me to put confidence in those fucking morons. I guess you bought their "but we're doing wind (with a trivial 1% of our gross)! We're an energy company!" No, they're fucking not.

Yeah 0.5% of outstanding shares is only like 350K shares, but that's only what's needed to be put on that list. We aren't really sure what % is actually failing to deliver. There are more shares short than total float. (Shortsqueeze is showing 67.98M shares short.) Also,  it could cause a chain reaction plus it's getting to the end of the year so some might cover more and eat the losses for taxes. We shall see how it goes. I'm gonna be jumping as early as possible but ready to bounce at a moment's notice lol

I have 10k left and trying to yolo as well. I've had 50%/25%/25% in good spacs recently but sold out for nothing basically. Just want one big play bc I am an asshole..
The market keeps going up in part due to the dollar dying a slow death. Cash is now trash and savings pays almost nothing so only place to throw your money is the market or maybe RE if you can afford it and I guess Pokemon cards apparently.

I think it makes a lot more sense for Apple, a computer company who's already built a bunch of their own chips, to get involved with the self driving side of things. Producing chips like Mobileye does would actually make some sense.

It makes no sense at all that Apple would actually construct their own cars, they don't even fucking construct their own iPhones and farm it all out to Foxconn and Wistron and Pegatron.

The point of hedging is to not lose capital. So hedge funds may have been doing things like buying puts to hedge their longs all year long, which isn't exactly free.

The idea is that once you're already very wealthy, you don't actually need to become super wealthier since that doesn't really serve any meaningful purpose to the vast majority of people.

When you're not rich you focus on getting rich, but most people who've already made it just wanna stay there, not become Jeff Bezos or Elon Musk.

Thanks! Super useful!
I used BABA a few weeks ago and it’s such a scam. They delivered something that was completely opposite of what they said. Order had trade assurance, but every response is timed and auto cancels after 8 hours if you don’t reply. Even when I went through it all, they said red is close to pink, not a big enough error for refund.

Is this going to be Apple TV all over again? I used to cover cable/telecom stocks and there were always rumours about how Apple was coming to disrupt TV and change the game and all they ended up doing was making half efforts in coming up with a watered down product

I find it so funny that if curreny tanks and the world goes to shit somehow gold coins and bars are going to save you. Like wtf are you going to do with that hit someone? I wouldn't trade a can of soup for a gold bar in the apocalypse. Guns and bullets is the real value.

Yes. You keep the premium regardless of whether the calls are exercised or not. If you’re broker is RH it won’t show a lower average cost tho if you look at your shares. But it is factored into your overall P&L.

Where was I crying exactly? My point was the paper hands caused the dip they feared which perpetuated more panic sell off. It was a negative feedback loop that I called out for what it was, a result of their own fear. I'm unsure how my resilience could be misunderstood as emotional, but this place is known for water heads so feel free to carry on.

Step 1) Sell your calls at 50-80% loss and lock-in capital losses. 

Step 2) Use remainder to buy as many hookers and blow as possible.

Step 3) Get COVID from hooker(s).

Step 4) Profit.
so just wait for BABA and then get in with shares ? i mean longterm and hold like 3 years 🚀
Yeah, first time I woke up to -10%

Realistically, I think it was surprising to see it still do as well as it did today after yesterday's crazy day. A pullback feels like the more logical move rather than continuing to run.

The only time the investment goes into China is if they sell more shares directly.

US people buying and selling off each other is still money getting created in the economy to be spent.

It doesn't hurt the US to have a Chinese company with a large stock price.

Honestly this is the truth, this is why Xi is trying to tame it.
In this case, it would’ve worked, as the price slowly trickled back down from the hod, & the bid/ask spread is only $2 bucks wide

They only have to close the actual settlement failures though so this isn't really something that should trigger a massive short squeeze. If anything the only reason this will go up is that it's already going up anyway and now everyone on WSB will be buying calls and causing MM's to drive the price up. So I guess we may get a bit of a self fulfilling short squeeze at best.

This is a previously announced deal with NCATS but this new amount ($9.55M) [just got awarded](https://i.imgur.com/qT6P3Dz.png) (credit: [InvetForever](https://stocktwits.com/InvetForever)).   Announcement likely won't come on this at all.   Many Government funded agencies frown upon the self-reporting of increases to large contract expenditures and this is a furtherance of value contract award to an existing deal.  This might get a tweet or something from them for acknowledgement but don't expect it on Mad Money

I've been thinking this and posting about this the last couple days. We'll find out tomorrow but yeah I thinkt here's a chance management released the news because it was on the 13th day. Not all shorts have to cover, just those that have failed to deliver, which if you look at fintel data really isn't that much. But again, it's a painful day to be forced to find shares to deliver or cover if it also happens when trading is halted and good bullish news comes out.
Could just short shares, eh?

If anything sherman dropped the news because of the 13th day sho thing, but really the 13th day sho only forces shorts that have failed to deliver to either deliver or cover. It makes it painful for those shorts to have to do this on a day when news drops of course, but if you look at fintel data it really isn't that many shares shorted that have failed to deliver compared to the overall amount of shares shorted. I do think this is worth a play, and have been eyeing it myself, but it's not going to be THE SQUEEZE (probably). But if sherman drops some news I do think another 30+% is possible.

Dude China is such pussy. You have a beast in BABA that you can literally rule the world with and grow into a country gem and do amazing things with but instead you’re putting it in a cage because you feel threatened. 

Dude, find a way to fucking use BABA to your advantage don’t kill it you fucks. Empower that bitch and be cool don’t be a commy dingus

Nah. It won't. SPACs typically spike after LOI, then DA, then merger if it's an EV stock. Sometimes, however, a SPAC will get serious attention between these steps. When this happens, it's usually because its trading as a derivative of another SPAC that already merged and is soaring. Look at Gig3capital/lightning eMotors and Tuscan Holdings. Both trading as derivatives of XL fleet and Quantum scape respectively.

STIC isn't spiking for any of the aforementioned reasons. It's because "pets" are a massive secular growth play. People love their dogs. Millennials can't afford children or don't want them and they fill the emotional void with animals. So they spoil them by buying expensive shit. I've seen tons of articles about the pet industry booming for the last 2 years or so. STIC will go up long term, it's undervalued at this price level. It's gonna get valued like Chewy, which is to say, really damn high. Other SPACs will start doing this too at some point. SSPK is a prime candidate since legal pot is a similarly growth-rich industry.

EDIT: Don't forget, the pattern for trading SPACs is slowly going to get recognized by everyone in the market and start correcting itself. The pattern of spikes at LOI------->DA------>Merger is going to go away as investors start realizing that the risk involved in buying SPACs is lower than it used to be, and those curves will get smoothed into a slow linear-ish curve like most stocks.

Yup, I noticed a few companies are on 2/1/21. I don't trust RH to send anything like that out.  But Charles consumed TD, so they should be sending the same message out.

A mix of Jan/March expiry calls. I'm scared papi
A $10 call when the stock is already $20 is an easy sell?  It's already in the money.  Especially since everyone is now expecting it to go further up.
It was because of the MSFT news, i mean trading got halted lol. But IMO sherman planned the news drop to be on the 13th SHO day. Not all shorts have to cover, just those that failed to deliver, which if you look at the fintel data really isn't that much. That being said it would be a painful day to be forced to find shares or cover if it happens when a big news item drops.
Well, 81 million people did so too late now.

Upside down Poland.
The one big wrong thing about this post is it kind of insinuates that 68m shares will have to cover or whatever. Only the ones that have failed to deliver would be. If you look at the fintel data it really isn't that many shares that have failed to deliver, someone correct me if I'm wrong but someone else who posts in these threads often has repeatedly pointed out that it really isn't that many shares that have failed to deliver. That being said...

IMO what happened last time was that Sherman decided to drop the MSFT news because GME had been on the SHO list fro 13 days. Maybe it was coincidence, but given the fact that they've been so tight lipped about what the partnership entails makes me think they had some motive for releasing that info - it'd be a painful day to need to cover a position if some bullish news came in that drove up stonk price.

I wouldn't yeet into anything at open, but this is definitely worth a bullet an hour or two into trading betting that Sherman does something again to pump up stonk price. He is incentivized to do so to make it more expensive for Cohen to buy voting power, and also it makes Sherman look better to shareholders should some sort of vote be put up

There’s a feeling that goes along with buying FDs. It’s not always positive. It often has fear, frustration or the sense that maybe you’ve bit off more than you can CHWY.

But doing the real thing matters. Days wasted on investing activity may keep you busy, but they never seem to go anywhere. A life spent on real risk may not always be the easiest or most stable, but it’s the one that pays in the end.

Yea, I have some open right now, they’re a good strat. But as far as indexes like SPY and QQQ shares are the way if you’re looking at a 5 year hold. Imagine SPY LEAPS from 2017-2020 expiring in March. 3 years of gains wiped out in a month and nothing to show for it, then we rebound within the year

No.  You can play the last gen version on the new systems, but they have confirmed that they will release a proper next gen version in 2021.  Might be delayed to 2022 though is what I'm thinking, given all the work they have to do on Cyberpunk.  Nevertheless, it will sell like hotcakes when released.  Long CDPR is the play.

Sorry, shares, I'm just holding shares.
Some true thoughts indeed
I'm long gme as well, but if you are worried about this dip, then maybe you should have been "paper handed" as well, as you are clearly emotional about this stock / too deep.

No one is going to look out for you, and crying about paper handers driving the price down while you are left bag holding won't change the fact that you are poor now and they secured gains.

That being said, GME will only keep going up, providing we bounce off \~19.50 or don't go near it at all tomorrow. Strong volume below 19.50 would be worrysome.
This is why I was hands off. I think it is/has been undervalued but Fuck. Between us & now china gov they can't get fuck all done

I held 10 x $120C 1/15/21 that I sold FOR A LOSS cause I read some "analysis" from some boomer fuck (not and autist here) that talked about how these big tech companies control their stock prices to ensure fucking over short position holders.  I bought into it and paper handed like a bitch.
Like they say everyone’s a genius in a bull market. The truth is the real genius is realizing a correction is happening and short the market on the way down and buy it as it starts to rebound. We keep having V shaped corrections and recoveries. Fear and greed. Most people buy the top, sell the bottom, and don’t get back in till it’s too late.
Nah it cratered initially, then dropped another 10%+ on release when everyone realized how ass the performance was. You can look for yourself.

~~I hold a ton of 2022 $300 BABA leaps.~~ I did start cutting my losses and invested a portion in JD and SE 2022 leaps following the unexpected ANT IPO debacle. ~~My position in BABA is pretty big to jump ship ☹️ (day 1 investor since its IPO in NYSE) and with Alicloud expected to turn profit by end of financial year (March 2021) I believed 2021 will be a breakout year with Alibaba becoming the first Chinese company with $1 Trillion valuation in NYSE based on Free cash flow estimates.~~

The short term headline risk with BABA is real and I hope Jack Ma would mend his relations with Chinese regulatory bodies.

Closed my 2022 $300 BABA leaps for a big loss. Bought 2022 $250 BABA leaps as I believe Alicloud turning profit in 2021 and stable US-China relations under Biden administration will increase the valuation.

This sub has been full of gamblers since before the rona market though
There's a subreddit that makes satire comics about countries that keeps quality up by literally maintaining a whitelist of the _only_ people allowed to submit things.

If you aren't on that list, your post is automatically removed. To get on the list, you have to make something funny and send it to the mods. If the mods like it, they can add you and let you submit stuff.

The subreddit also will ban anyone that references it from another subreddit, in order to help keep noobs out (which is why I'm being fairly vague). It's honestly done a great job in keeping the sub manageable... but also requires the mods to be up to date on manually approving users to post.

Similar thoughts. Technicals predict a move, with past trends i assume its a bullish one. No news, so most likely catalyst is lockdown driven shopping.

I have been holding since shortly after IPO and follow the stock closely. We are heading into their strongest quarter and have had a few analyst upgrades with lower targets being around $35. I could see some short term volatility bouncing between $37-40 but I personally don’t see going back below $35. I am hoping we creep back to $50 in the next quarter.

Positions; long shares, selling 1/15 $35P and monthly covered calls.

Look up what a wash sale is
BABA call holders are unwrapping Christmas presents and trying to return them tomorrow
I went down 18k (50%) at my lowest point and made 25k in one month. That not good enough for you? Everyone here is addicted to gambling and immediate dopamine hits. With spacs post merger announcement trading near NAV, you’re making a risk free trade for a good chance at 35+% gains quickly. Trade in seeing 200% gain in one day but a chance at -100% in one month for 35+% gain in a couple weeks with -10-20% risk. It’s literally the smarter and more calculated gamble. If you can’t see that you’re not only addicted to gambling, you have a dopamine issue
Natural fat globs please and thank you
I'm sure it was more of a cost thing for Elon because Lidar was quite expensive compared to radar. Luckily Lidar sensors are getting cheaper and perhaps will be put on Tesla vehicles in the future but who knows.

The quick and dirty of it is: If delta goes up, shorts need to buy shares to properly hedge. The 13th day deadline under the SHO failure to deliver stuff may require shorts to cover more than normal. It’s not likely to be a slow event. It is probably going to be massive buying at the near end of the trading day. My favorite part about this is that one short might completely fuck over another by covering their own ass.

i hate this fucking year with a passion bro
How the fuck am I going to unload all the $2.00C 4/16/21 LYG positions I have been collecting since they were 1 cent? They are up 2000+% but the fucking volume is so low that if I try to unload even 50 a day (I have A LOT of them) Ill fuck up the price. Fuck, I don’t what the shares but I guess that might be the way? I also have a few hundred of the $1.00c but I think I can unload a dozen of them a day moving forward without causing havoc. Lesson learned kids.... don’t fuck with low volume options.

If you click his username and read his older posts it will provide insight and also amusing to see the comments he was getting back then.

Basically, in the land before time GME was like $4 and everyone thought it was total shit (it mostly is).  Lots of people were betting against it by shorting shares.  But they actually have a lot of money saved up even if they are currently flailing around, enough that they are actually worth more than $4/share just based on assets and shit.  Fast forward to november.  New consoles are coming out, poorly performing stores are being closed, an activist investor is buying up shares and trying to change the business model.  So things are looking somewhat up, and the people shorting it are getting further underwater and the amount of shares they can actually buy are limited.  OP saw all this in advance (except maybe ryan cohen) and has been waiting to pounce.  He bought all these shares and options when they were cheap because no one expected a turnaround.  Now they are expensive.

Levers you up yo, this is wsb
My understanding is hedgefunds can do basically whatever the hell they want. Beating the market is absolutely the goal. They're risk neutral. The fee structures often include hurdle rates - a return which must be passed before the fund manager gets a cut of the profit. Hedging may or may not be involved. But there will certainly be a huge variation between funds. Some will outperform significantly. Others die off.
I bought thiccboi based on some dumb post here, don’t even know what their acquisition is gonna be but I am down with how it’s performed the last few weeks. Feeling like a retard for only buying one share of QS back when it was a spac (kcac or some shit? Who knows) for $22 so perhaps I will buy a bunch of thiccboi based on your post

What a stupid fucking article. They are giving out a big subsidy that will benefit single moms the most and then the feminists still bitch because the mommies have to fill out a fucking form to get their free money?
Which would you buy? Why leaps over shares, apart from cost savings?
Movie theatres sucked before covid.  I'd rather watch new releases on my couch.  I doubt I'm alone in that.

Thanks for replying. Why not ARKK or FAANGM. Their annual returns in the past 5 years are better than QQQ and SPY. Just wanting to understand your rationale. Thanks

Forget the wording, instead of giving citizens, Canada is cherry picking single mothers for our "second" stimmy.

As long as you “gambled” it forget about it for awhile. Pretend you lost it. Close the app. Check it out in a few months.
This is a good idea
Can one of these new covid strains at least raise the dead or turn us purple or something. It’s just a depressing parade of hacking lungs and death. Spice it up a little, you fuck.

Go to GNC - buy the cheap gnc brand protein, and a good expensive good tasting one. Swap the two, put the good one in the bad gross cheap gnc brand and put the good one in the gnc brand container, return the “expensive one” get good tasting branded protein for cheap.

Uhm, while most Americans enjoyed a free $1200 check and increased unemployment insurance, a very small percentage of Canadians got any sort of stimulus.

Now while Americans get a second stimmy, Justin T is announcing a new stimulus package for mothers with children under 6. Again, specifically cherry picking a very small percentage of the entire population.
That was the goal
God speed 🙏

Because they can't cover their positions with a call contract they'll still have to exercise the option which still requires buying the shares. You also can't buy 68milllion worth of shares through call. No entity can supply that.
Why are you here
So buy $20c 12/31 on the dip tomorrow, sell them on Monday or Tuesday and buy april calls with the money?

How big? 😏
So if I’m understanding correctly, GME is heavily shorted, but with the price continuing to go up, these shorts need to be paid back so everyone who has borrowed these stocks will be buying higher and it will drive the price up even more?

Right but let’s say your principal was $100k and your gains in 2020 were $100k coming into the last week. If you bought $100k in puts and $100k in calls on the same stock for March exp, and you sold one at a loss before 2020 ended for -40%, would you only have to pay taxes on $60k for 2020 and basically delay the taxes on the other $40k for a year

AMZN is by far my worse nemesis. First stock I ever bought when a friend had me set up my IRA . At one point had 10 shares at a cost of sub 1000 per. Started to actively manage my portfolio and sold and have consistently been on the wrong side of AMZN since. Yay me being a dumb shit and not holdig forever
Surprising he can get here, since he can’t fucking learn how to google

Don't feel too bad. Blackrock, Bridgewater, Vanguard, Fidelity, Ark, Third Point, Gates Foundation, Appaloosa, Invesco, and T Rowe are all still way ahead of WSB.

I think FCEL is a different company then what it was. They got rid of the old CEO last year and that’s when it starts to turn around. It was plague with toxic debts before, but the recent offering was used to pay off the last lender, Orion. So no more debt. I think there is a lot of room to grow. I’m up $40k with fcel.

I’ve had them for a few weeks now. I’ve been selling 4% OTM weeklies to make up for some of the theta decay and have been doing well. I also have a March 19 $3700 call.
