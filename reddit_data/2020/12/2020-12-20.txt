Looking to add to my growth portfolio, what do you guys think I should add? Currently have PLUG, SBE, MP and NIO.

how u know dis?
Nkla did not dump. I know because I held through the merger. I sold the day after it changed tickers, then the following day it went from 27ish to 67. Missed out on about 7k by one day.
Who cares
Alex Karp needs to start a twitter account and begin typing his genius thoughts to pump tendies for us Palantirians.
Also as someone in the other industry I agree but disagree.

First look at the markets they are entering it’s all growing and/or large markets. This allows the AI they use to learn as the company grows on a more broad scale where the typical subdivisions and neighborhoods are larger and lack uniqueness from Propoerty to property because they are so big or because they were all developed at once cause it then to be more similar.

BUT they aren’t profitable for the reasons you mentioned it’s gonna take them a very long time but the longer it goes the more their computer system should learn and be able to better predict which houses to buy.

THE MOST IMPORTANT PART though is that they’ve come out and said that it’s not the house flipping business that they see their future revenue coming from it’s going to be through virtually replacing the broker bank and legal fees that are accumulated when you buy or sell real estate. They will eventually put on their site a way for you to finance and buy your house and various other needs like appraising or surveying.

Anyway it’s just a cool idea that will take years to come to fruition. Just could see how it could change the way residential real estate.
If it was fully priced in the market wouldn’t react every 2 seconds when stimulus talks were negative or positive. But we shall see...

👆🏻 what he/she said

 “dedicated funding for live venues, independent movie theaters, and cultural institutions,”
Any after hours price changes don't reflect on options, in addition since there was so much price movement in the last five minutes Friday, there likely wasn't enough selling volume on that specific option for Robinhood or whoever to be able to correctly guess the market price. They base it off of actual sales, not predictions of what it would be worth, you gotta estimate that yourself
I don't think it will be about having an AI with the minimal safety. Just as Tesla's are the safest cars in its class, I wouldn't trust another car that barely made it pass the government's minimum bar. But I believe there will be differentiators in the better autonomous driving AIs. For example, Tesla aren't just simply going from point A to B, they're avoiding potholes, automatically closing their side-view mirrors to squeeze through tight spots. These aren't things I would have imagined them doing. But besides that, other car companies aren't even aiming toward the same goal as Tesla. Other companies, including Google, rely on fully mapping out every square inch of a city in order to drive it. That's simply not scalable. Tesla is trying to have the car drive on unmapped roads automatically. This is similar to when Yahoo dominated search by simply manually linking the entire web. That was fine when only a few (thousand) companies had websites, but once everyone and their grandmother had a geocities account, you couldn't possibly index the entire web manually. Google came along and indexed and ranked the entire web using a PageRank algorithm. So Google's search approach compared to Yahoo is Tesla's approach compared to the rest of the industry. And yes, there is a network effect with data. The more people that drive tesla's, the more data they collect, the better the AI gets, which makes driving a Tesla more appealing. That's the feedback loop. There are 3 resources you need for AI, in order of importance: the data, the brain (ie smart data data scientists who analyze the data and develop the models), and the hardware. You can argue that several big firms have the brain and hardware resources. But Tesla has the data, real-world driving data. Other companies use simulations, or have a few million miles driven by an employee around the same city over and over again. This is not real data.

I can't speak about monetization of FSD. My domain expertise is not in economics or finances. Maybe yours is.

But I don't believe this stock's price is currently based on PE ratios or price-to-sales revenues, and maybe that's why many people have a hard time understanding it. I think PE ratios are inappropriate for a growth company. Amazon was over 1000 PE at one point and it was worth $600 then. I would kill for a chance to buy Amazon at that PE and price now. I don't believe ratios say anything what a stock price should be worth. Why is the average PE for one industry higher than another? It's just a random number just like the stock price itself. Ultimately, I think it all comes down to simple economics 101: supply vs demand. If more people think the stock price is fair or undervalued than people who think it's over-valued, then the price rises, otherwises it falls. As long as Tesla continues to execute on its plan and rewards us with periodic updates that show it's heading in the right direction and the right pace, people will continue to buy and hold. If in some quarter, that doesn't seem to be the case, then that should decrease the demand for shares at that price and decrease the share price. Even if many people believe Tesla is overvalued, I believe the market is still working perfectly and Tesla's share price will always reflect that fact.

yea shares would still be great but I’m expecting GME to run huge in 2021 with all the upcoming events and Cohen possibly taking over sometime in 2021. I want to try and get the best return I can with this opportunity. But I could just hold these options all the way through no? The 20c’s will def go deep ITM by November IMO. I’d say there’s a possibility that shorts slowly start to cover if GameStop could release a good strategic plan in January
Better ingredients, better edging, papa pornhub.
Because hospitals and prisons used to be public services and now that their private, look what's happened to them.  Because despite the old bullshit line about how the government is inefficient, it runs a system that is more fair to the consumer than any other because it's main purpose isn't capitalism, i.e. fucking the consumer out of the most money possible while providing the least amount of goods/service.  And because the U.S. government promised it would provide this service to it's citizens, knowing how essential it was to the growth and continued growth of the nation.

That's all I can think of off the top of my head.
Everyone just YOLOs here..
I think everyone is desperate for that to happen because they purchased to high and now they're in a tough spot. I'm speaking from experience.

Lol $600 stim, literally 1 extra week of salary if you make $15/hr for 40 hours a week.

Whatever makes my calls go up though
I think the only reason the public market was doing so well was because of the Secondary Market Corporate Credit Facility, which let lenders sell bonds in companies/municipalities that were going south to the FED and let the FED write off the debt in case that company went bankrupt. That program is now going to end, causing lenders to rethink how and to whom they are going to lend money.
This could be very good or very bad. 
Either way I’m in 🚀🚀🚀

Well if you've only got 50K to lose then don't play it all, no yolo's. You kinda sound like scared money. Scared money makes big mistakes and tends to be on the wrong side of the trade. You can start small. This has been an extraordinary market and some WSBers do the yolo and post gain/loss but don't get so caught up in the fomo that you end up broke.

You do know that oil going up had more to do with a weakening dollar than presidential election results.... right? 

While I agree Trump was not the oil industries friend and he purposely dropped the ball big time on this past crash. 

But oil being up is merely a weakening USD effect.
they have a bunch of catalysts coming up. and as we know, stocks don't go up on catalyst days, they go up or down 2-4 weeks before a catalyst event to get "ahead of the game". PLTR gonna fucking moon this week due to stim, corona, pltr events and Q4 earnings a month and a half away (they're gonna be great we all know it).

You'd be right except for one small minor detail - the stock market no longer gives a fuck what's going on with regular people or the economy. It's reached a level of speculation never before seen. People are talking about Tesla being a $1T company despite a yearly revenue of $20B....

No, we don't do that here
But you know what doesn’t happen all the time? A shitty stimulus. We’re gonna drop even lower
Good grasp on the problem, now what's your idea of a solution? Adapt or die, imo. If you want bloated systems where half the people don't add value look at big slow bureaucracies like the government or military. They're fairly well run given the size but they're still super inefficient and experience tons of waste, fraud and abuse. Capitalism rewards businesses and entrepreneurs that make people's lives better and solve a real or perceived problem. Honestly its never been easier to make money in America.

how can i save money for a house when i have to pay rent?
Nice model. I’m just split on what to do right now. I have all shares right now, but I want to buy calls cuz I could make a lot more with the run it will have in 2021 if I’m holding options. The only thing I’m afraid off is if IV plummets, but I really can’t see a situation where Iv drops drastically, no? Besides Q4 ER, which would drop IV a little most likely, what else is there? I’m thinking about going with the 20c but I’m not sure what date. Leaning towards November 2021 20c

A vaccine that will probably work... Cool.

How long does the antibody response last from the vaccine?  Infection and recovery?

It took a concerted effort globally to pull out an MRNA vaccine in 9 mo, what if mutations outpace vaccines?

Mother fucker this is not all over.  I ain't no sooner neither, just aware of fucking facts and science.

You've switched your argument from "mutations are always less lethal" to some other shit because you're fucking wrong so shut the fuck up and go suck JPOWs cock like a good bull bitch.
Yep super bullish.  There's also been some gigantic block buys on it

Only got a 600 stimmy this time which doesn't have nearly as much fanfare surrounding it and has even been heavily criticized. Not going to have the same economic impact either.
Ah, yep, he might not be able to hear his own mix tape over all of the ruckus
what is what you just did called?
This is actually a big deal.
We all know futures are gonna fade between -.1%-.3% and then immediately pump on open. Tell me I’m wrong this shit happens all the time.

All the regulation that Trump remove , sleepy Joe will bring them back and that is not gonna help to push the stock market all time high
“Why isn’t Congress giving our people a Stimulus Bill? It wasn’t their fault, it was the fault of China,” Trump said on Twitter. “GET IT DONE, and give them more money in direct payments.”
Welll here's the thing.  Over the last year the worst has already been priced in.  Companies book value if servicing has already been decimated, hence the drop in IV..R, NY..MT, R.W.T , NRZ ect stock price.

I gave long calls on all of them through this year, and as more niche lenders [looking @ you NRZ/,RWT] can securitize again, they will have better liquidity and cash flow. 

I truly beleive IV..R can go up by a factor of 4 in the next 6 months, and that still wouldn't even get them to pre pandemic levels 

I think betting against the housing market is betting against a stacked deck.  Only way it works is if the rest of the economy crashes around it

Ahh I see you put your money on the wrong side. Jk idk what’s gonna happen but I do hope TSLA fucking crashes this week lol

Slow knife penetrates the shield.
This whole rant is so disconnected from reality
Imagine putting your money in a hedge fund or letting a financial advisor manage it. What type of idiot does that.
Unpopular opinion: news is bullish and not priced in but MMs are shaking hands out with news of London which the market has seen worse of before.
Can we all just agree that whether a bull or a bear the thing that we all have in common is that that nobody is going to lose any money at all tomorrow except for bears?
lol ik what happens i was just making sure it was all automatic
Intel still dominates data center. If you look at nvdia and amd they don’t even come close. Yes I know the news/future looks bleak for intel but until that market begins to decline or they lose significant market share I think intel is overall undervalued.

I live in UPS's central shipping hub's city.  Everyone here works for them.  My brother is one of the guys who coordinates loading the planes.  So I just asked him what volume is like compared to earlier in the year vs. now and vs. "peak"(Christmas Season) last year.  He says it's up a bit from both, but he didn't make it sound dramatic.  He said a large part of it is the vaccine.  They've been shipping a lot of packages with dry ice, which he has to monitor closely, because if he has his crew load too much onto a plane, the CO2 that sublimates, will kill everyone.

You ever wonder, what the fuck are snails doing?
I hear your point about the momentum being low right now, but I don't agree that there are no more "future events." When/if the pandemic winds down you'll start hearing about businesses coming back to life and people's lives (hopefully) going back to normal. Those types of future events will be extremely bullish.

I wouldn't surprised with a mild dip or things going sideways for a couple of weeks (a month top) but I don't see it staying that way. The party isn't over, it's just a lull while tendies re-supply.

Thanks for the response. I’ll take a look at leaps, I don’t have much experience with options, but want to leverage my money with them for long term investments. Not sure if I’ll qualify for trading options on TD Ameritrade since I have limited experience with options. Any proven companies that are causing a disruption to a centralized way of doing business is a worthy long term investment in my book.

the challenge is supply chains & allocations. There seems to have been some share taken by Sony/Microsoft direct-to-consumer channel, at least through the preorders. Any overreaction to weaker results should be bought on the dip, as demand would simply be delayed into 2021 if unsatisfied due to too much scalping and not enough launch software.

" After Smythe worried about being too old to have children when Shkreli got out of prison, he suggested she freeze her eggs. She did so last spring. Rita Cushenberry, who befriended Smythe while visiting her own boyfriend in prison, observed Smythe and Shkreli together there. “He has the biggest, warmest smile ever,” she says, and “it was a beautiful thing to see how her eyes would just light up.”

Oh my spy calls,smh.
My belief is they suspect they can attack the price after a weak (whether real or FUD-perception) Jan 12th-ish holiday sales report and lackluster ICR Conference (Jan 13th) presentation. They will likely try to offload their short share position to retail (as I believe they may have begun doing) and keep the price in the teens and below \~$18/19 before Cohen's prospective board slate in early March.

There is no argument against it.  It has a roughly 50+B market cap.  As it keeps growing over the next few years, it could reach at least 1T, bringing the share price at least to 400.  I'm hoping for 600 at least.

Remember that a lot of those facilities went unused for a reason. The municipal credit facility only had two issuers tap into it and was less than 0.5% used. This is because municipalities could tap the public markets for much better rates. It is honestly best they re-purpose these funds elsewhere.

Not until we see inflation. In the mean-time there will be some asset inflation in stocks and housing market, when we start to see actual inflation the fed will increase the interest rates a bit. That will pare down the asset inflation (causing stocks and housing market to correct a bit).

Right now the fed is in 100% deflationary/QE mode in order to get the economy booted up so I wouldn't worry about it yet. When you start hearing about interest rate rises that is when you need to think about reducing the aggressiveness of your portfolio.

At first glance I know some of those numbers are not right.   Per my mortgage information [which is publicly available on HousingWire.com and other sources] less than 5.5% of homes are not paid current on their mortgage as of now.  Most of those are investment properties. 

Home equity is at an a time high and less than. 1% of homes are "underwater" meaning anyone who can't make payments anymore will have to sell short.

The biggest assets under distress in the housing industry are multi-family rentals in big east coast cities.  Those are overwhelming owned by large corporations 

Also, companies are not allowed to mark anyone late until the end of 2020.  After that, we need 6 months of missed payments to START foreclosure process which take probably about 2+ years, more if the system is gummed up

I have about $1300 in GME shares right now (bought at 17...). I know there is a catalyst in Jan of Q4 sales update. So I might put in a few more grand and ride out through to end of Jan for that pop. I don't personally have enough conviction in this one to hold for much longer than that, but hope you are right and that you make big big moneys from a successful turnaround.

Here's a run it up the gut play from the Satanic playbook.

CNBC spams $600 stimulus is priced in all morning while Cramer snorts beta blockers for high blood pressure to counteract the cocaine.

Bears hold their puts and load up on even more.

Stimulus fails during last minute negotiations and bears reverse mortgage their cardboard homes.

Stim passes later in the afternoon with $800 checks. That extra $200 wasn't priced in. SPY ends the day at 374 and end the week at 378.

Extra point: TSLA opens at 620 then closes at 700.
Yo Im looking at Cd Projekt Red (OTGLY). Cyberpunk may have had a rough launch, but everyone I know has 30+ hours on it already. Everybody is talking about it, and it is going to be here to stay.

Guys we are so fucking retarded & I can't believe this. Even though I like ARKG, the option prices for it are kinda expensive & for the underlying stocks, even more. There are a lot of gene editing companies that went up 300% + this year but retards like us focus only on CRSP, NTLA, EDIT, BEAM etc.

Think BIG. The other companies have low premium. How low you ask? 0.01. What's the catch? A lot of people don't know about this and has low OI & vol. IF a lot of us can join and make them meme stocks, we can see 2000% + gains.  **DISCUSS**

Agreed. Feeling like an idiot not buying the dip in November. NHL seasons just announced for January 2021.

PLTR is great company. Just buy the stock and hold it for a long time; or just do LEAPs if you want to use leverage. Trying to time the market using Technical Analysis, or reading tea leaves, or horoscope reading,  is just a waste of money.

Canada is also messed up. Probably worse than the US actually. Banks are screwed with low rates, the home equity driven housing bubble continues to grow even though no one makes enough income to financially support the prices.

There isnt one. Use coinbase lol
But it says they’ll be done before market open! Surely we can trust them?
Your mind is stuck in preBRRR thinking.
the annualized e-commerce revenue rate should be ~$1.3-$1.5B for 2020. Obviously there's BOPIS & in-store ordering conflated with that, but GME has grown their e-commerce platform pretty incredibly y/y. There's a multiple re-rating upside there you might be omitting if you chalk it up as 100% retail.
Same, he sounds like a woman
I see more of these posts about the pennant than the actual movement, which is kinda sad :(. With that being said, PLTR to the fucking MOON 🚀
At current stimmy bill talks, Feds lending programs are expiring EoY. Fed can still make new programs but they can't be identical to the ones that were made this year if they don't want to go through congress. Not sure what other types of programs they can make to backstop the market after these are gone but seems pretty broad wording.

The stimulus checks was the smartest aspect of the pandemic response just not properly applied.

Every American under 75,000 should have received 1200 for each month of this year and down it to 600 for next year.

That would have been a smarter way, would it have cost a pretty penny? Yeah, but you know what the budget doesn’t matter cause we just keep increasing our borrowing limit anyway and clearly it’s just a gimmick at this point to be against the national debt.
Typically no

Not to mention with current stimmy talks, the FEDs backstop lending programs are expiring EoY. They can still make new ones but they can't be identical to the ones they did this year if they don't wanna go through congress. Not sure what other kind of programs they can make to backstop the market.

$600 will not stop people from getting mass evicted. Its terrible news for the average person. Has the stock market cared about the average person though ever?
Y’all ever think about how much of a sociopath you have to be to want to be a politician, and these are the people we let run the country?
Toppings include shell casings and house rubble. Served with a dash of crippling depression.
Na it's the cost of hiv meds.
No I still have my job.  It’s other people I’m worried about.  But you stupid fake patriots that think rubbing free market on you sore pussies will fix everything and fuck everybody else cause it’s about “personal responsibility”. Problem is you never take the time to realize people get fucked and need help.  It’s pretty gross you don’t want to help people.  Keep jerking off in your basement loser.

with the fed printing money and acting as a floor on the market by buying, I seriously doubt any kind of big correction.  These are crazy times.  A small one would still hurt, but would be great in mid jan, because my bet would be just like in mid july, when things got really rocky again, and I bought spreads going into earnings at end of july.

The fact is that medical advancements happen in the US. If you can’t afford good healthcare then it’s obviously not very good. If you have all the money in the world you are seeing a specialist in the US because they are the world leaders in research and skill you literal retard. There is no debating this fact. Your dumbass numbers comparing average health of illegal immigrants and literal welfare recipients in a country of 350 million compared to the populations of fucking Canada at 35 million.

Vaccine distribution is not priced in. Once more nurses have the vaccine they’ll be sidelined less from saving lives. Less lives lost is bullish. Other news such as employment will be based on things like ppe and businesses pivoting and adjusting. I’m optimistic for most manufacturing activities in the US; service industry I’m worried about
Its beyond pathetic. Either they are the dumbest people on here or purposely trying to hype a stock that hasn't announced anything yet.

**Lets check on our girl Nancy Pelosi and her option plays**

At the end of February 2020 she purchased:

>150 MSFT $130 strike calls expiration 3/19/21 at a price of 60.20

>100 MSFT $140 strike calls expiration 3/19/21 at a price of 51.55

Pelosi paid around $1.4 million for these options and they are worth today around:

#$2,100,000

The funny thing is that she purchased this right before the COVID dip and held it through the pandemic. This is why we call her Diamond Hands Pelosi around here.

So what is her latest options move? Heavy bet on PayPal this summer, she got a lot of shares and Purchased 50 call options with a strike of $100 and an expiration date of 01/21/2022

Point is, government is historically bad at deciding where money should go.  Give the people the money so they can vote what needs to be saved.  This is the whole basis of free economies.
Should have spent half as much and only gotten the 1/8th carat. Used the savings on a nail job. If you are locking this kind of woman down with a diamond like that, you're gonna want a smoother nail job.

K.7. What happens if an employer cannot exempt or provide a reasonable accommodation to an employee who cannot comply with a mandatory vaccine policy because of a disability or sincerely held religious practice or belief?

If an employee cannot get vaccinated for COVID-19 because of a disability or sincerely held religious belief, practice, or observance, and there is no reasonable accommodation possible, then it would be lawful for the employer to exclude the employee from the workplace.
I guess this is an paid story as an advertisement for his website?

Since their IPO I have been wanting to short the stock. The option chain is just so expensive.
It is only people that work for brokerages or manage client's portfolios.  I work for a mid/large bank and don't have to do this.  Though they did have to review my credit history.
STATISTICALLY mutations make it weaker moron.

Not every mutation makes a disease less lethal, it's just the ones that tend to make it lower lethality as lethality limits the R0, but this shits R0 is through the fucking roof and can spread in incubation period so that standard assumption goes out the fucking window.

Realistically student loan stuff isn't a huge political winner because most voters don't have those. It's a smaller group of people. Foreclosure and eviction affect probably 10-20 of the population but I'm sure lenders and investors will want to recoup their funds so I'm curious to see what the Biden admin does.

Well the fact that they're still making this much money and growing super fast while their platform isn't perfect yet just shows how much more room there is for improvement.  Sounds bullish to me.

In all seriousness though, a few salty people disconnecting from their game doesn't mean the company is a scam.
Bad bot
Oh this is not about to age well, is it..
They won't. Politically, delaying the stimulus to get all of their demands burns a lot of political capital with a runoff election still pending that could decide whether the Dems take control of House *and* Senate. 

If no stimulus is passed, Repubs can and will hammer the failure *during* the GA runoffs, which could cement further Dem losses.

If stimulus is passed, it won't necessarily hurt the Repubs but it will avert the catastrophe of the Dems coming across as the party haggling over small details instead of just getting a stimulus out.

For the Dems, it's a better move to pass a stimulus now, take control of the Senate, and then try and pass another stimulus once Biden is President.
Vaccine rollout news already is priced in, and the rest all could equally be bearish right?

An overlooked factor driving future potential for Tesla is the rabid cult of personality he has amassed in developing markets- India, Nigeria, Pakistan, Indonesia. All of them are in the top 10 most populous nations in the world, and they are rapidly modernizing. Do you think they're gonna give a shit about GM or VW's latest EV offerings? They worship Elon over there.

Last week 2980/3000 1/15 debit spreads were only $1040, max payout of 2k. Right now they're 1500. Long story short ITM spreads under 3000 are a safe play.
Honestly no idea, but I'd love to know an answer.  I can't even think of a reason other than maybe some properties in the reit aren't being filled and with a landlord you typically don't have that problem because they have so much control?  Genuinely curious now though.

covid19 strain 2 in UK?
What a simp.
It ended for a good portion of people in certain states as early as October.

I’m also referring to people in the cities that didn’t lose work until the second wave & second series of shutdowns. There’s a good chance that it’ll be weeks from now until they see any UI benefits if they see any at all, and knowing that; a $600 check to hold them over is comical.

Also, in certain states, with the traffic having increased due to the second series of shutdown; people who were already receiving benefits have to go through a re-verification process. It’s almost as if they’re re-applying. Friend of mine received 2 weeks of benefits, his state shut down, they’re now “re-verifying” his account and he hasn’t seen a cent for nearly a month.

It’s not as black and white as a lot of people like to think it is.

Standers have shit smeared between their cheeks
Long term effects have more impact than the deaths and occur at a much much higher rate.  Also mutant forms so we get to try again next year.

>I have never seen a video where someone so condescendingly tries to prove the guest wrong 

I'm not sorry to say this: Most people here are mentally retarded, you on the other hand might also be socially retarded if you think the host was being condescending. This was my first time watching the video and the host demonstrated articulation and challenging questions. And the guy in the center, at multiple points, stated his respect for Cathie Wood and her ETFs. The two guys were respectable and facilitated a healthy discourse, unlike the usual diatribes we see with other panelists. What did you want to see? A boring ass echo chamber that confirms your biases? I'd much rather prefer Cathie be given questions that are legitimately reason for concern and for her to be given a platform to respectfully defend her case as she did in the video.
Nobody read this thing except the editor.

A third of that’s going to PPP loans like last time.  It’s to keep businesses from Laying off people.   It televise burden from our Unemployment system, and keeps the job market from flipping on its head like in ‘09-‘12.   

I don’t agree with it on the grounds that it’s just printing money, but I think most businesses have used the PPP money to better effect than just writing every Joe Schmoe a check.

It means Jack shit when you realize average age of death from Covid is 82. 60% of all deaths are from long term care homes. Aka people who are dying. 1 million Russians died in Stalingrad in 1 day and the country was fine. I’m sure even 600,000 old people won’t impact anything long term
Pretty confused because the chairman of that company sold over 38% of his share

I’m up about 240% on Jan calls and 270% on April calls. Looking to roll up my Jan calls into LEAPS in the coming week or so
what brokerage do you use?  i have Vanguard and when i went to buy IPOB LEAPS the longest dated calls were May-21.  this was on Nov 18th.  i saw on CBOE's site that there were other contracts available that i could not see on Vanguard all the way out to Jan 2023.
Just watched a 5 minute explanation on where this stimulus money is coming from. So it looks like we will eventually have to pay all this back through higher taxes. Zoomers are fucked.
is $600 a lot of money to people? It's sad that that's the case, just goes to show the inequality in america. I'm not rich but $600??

Covid is at 2-3k daily deaths now in the US. Its an insanely high number. Really hard to comprehend. Over 300k deaths already in the US. We may be at 600k by the time this is all said and done. I'm trying to imagine exactly what this means and I'm struggling to understand it.
Look up SDBA / self-directed brokerage account. It’s pretty common, and a very fair request for a company to include it.

Yes, they are profitable. All depends on location.  It is a very attractive way to feed a family that likes different things with our deals. Everyone can have what they want. You can feed a family of 4 for less than $30. That’s rare these days. I do like pizza from family pizza parlors though. Real NY style pizza - but it’s not cheap. $20-25 depending how many toppings you like.  Most kids just want cheese. That’s where Domino’s fits in.  Good quality and value.

Retarded comparison, there's only like 600 congress members. That 600 is 219 billion but congress only earned 78m over 9 months which is 2807x more money but even before unemployment and special exceptions. Also it makes out money more worthless so now everyone who worked hard to be a millionaire or 100kaire now has like 1% less money in buying power. Effectively speaking this is just to keep poor lazy people from dying which is counter intuitive in it of itself.

shares at $100
There are over 200,000 clients at Vanguard that are Voyager Select or above.  This is 500k in assets.  Even if they just parked it all in an s&p etf for the year they have 75k in capital gains.  This is just one firm.  So I don't know what the average investor is pulling in but more people than you would think have made that much.

With the amount of DD people are putting in here I hope they are making significant money, otherwise it's honestly not worth the time to be putting in $20 trades.

For one the first thing you listed about yourself is money, not relationships. Two, if you meant actually a savings account and not your trading account, that's a colossal waste, put 100k into the market at least for something more than 0.03%

It's not as though the market has been sitting on its hands waiting for something to happen. We're at ATHs
Agreed. Agreed. But to make it work, we’ll have to operate in a way similar to a hedge fund and keep our collective actions secretive and ultimately prevent counter-actions to our actions. We want to manipulate the market and have it appear organic rather than like we’re the ones doing the manipulating.

It may be better to have an ETF That people could jump in on, and that way we could drive FOMO into our portfolio.

Id almost guarantee a large portion of the people that are applying for UI aren’t getting it in a timely enough manner for it to matter. And I get it, the systems are high traffic right now. But when your city shuts down on like three days notice, applying for UI and having to wait a month and a half before you hear anything back completely contradicts the idea that it’s “emergency assistance”

I know, and I actually was serious. Look up how it's calculated. It's derived from options activity on the SPX, literally.

It doesn't measure "volatility" -- volatility is standard deviation of SPX price movement over time. If a bunch of people buy puts on the SPX, that means VIX spikes. But the real volatility could remain low if SPX just trades flat.

Depends on how old you are but it’s reasonable to live in Mexico or Latin America with a family and have a nice place for under $25k per year.  So it’s possible with $500k or less as long as you have a decent portfolio to draw from.

**Dear Sir:**

**I have been requested by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company to contact you** for assistance in resolving a matter. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company has recently concluded a large number of contracts for oil exploration in the sub-Sahara region. The contracts have immediately produced moneys equaling US$40,000,000. The Nigerian National Petroleum Company is desirous of oil exploration in other parts of the world, however, because of certain regulations of the Nigerian Government, it is unable to move these funds to another region.

You assistance is requested as a non-Nigerian citizen to assist the Nigerian National Petroleum Company, and also the Central Bank of Nigeria, in moving these funds out of Nigeria. If the funds can be transferred to your name, in your United States account, then you can forward the funds as directed by the Nigerian National Petroleum Company. In exchange for your accommodating services, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company would agree to allow you to retain 10%, or US$4 million of this amount.

However, to be a legitimate transferee of these moneys according to Nigerian law, you must presently be a depositor of at least US$100,000 in a Nigerian bank which is regulated by the Central Bank of Nigeria.

Once youre set up though youre pretty much reliant on them. Their customer retention rate is phenomenal. Also 44% growth from last year with 1B in projected revenues, and they said that they see it going up 30% by the end of 2021.

From the pltr Q3 report 
"An oil and gas customer, one of the largest energy companies in the world, identified a new opportunity to use our software to save costs in connection with oil exploration activities and generated $57 million in cash savings within weeks of starting to use our platform.

The energy company identified an additional $315 million in cost savings opportunities using our software, and the company’s management is currently targeting $1 billion in total savings in the coming year through the use of our platform."

If adopting their software gives these results companies are going to be fiending to lock a contract in.

Been freebasin those Washington talking points huh? I would consider you look into the basic numbers before you feel the need to interject.  Again.... but any mesurable standard out health care is a complete farce. 

Australia, New Zealand, Denmark, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, The Netherlands, Sweden, Switzerland, Norway and the UK.

Even though the US is the only country without a publicly financed universal health care  it STILL spends more public dollars.

We spent 17.7% of GDP #2? France at 11% #3 the UK 8.3%

So please explain that number... go'head... i'll wait....

now lets add to that what Americans PRIVATLY pay for healthcare.  The premiums? How do we stack up with the rest?

The US fucking TOWERS over the #2..... Americans spend FIVE FUCKING TIMES what out friends north of the boarder do,

So what are we getting for our money?  Despite the highest spending, Americans experience worse health outcomes than their any of the aforementioned peers. For example, life expectancy at in the U.S. was 78.6 years in 2017 — more than two years lower than the OECD average and five years lower than Switzerland, which has the longest lifespan.   So we are spending a metic FUCKTON more than these other country's so we should get better results right? 

In 1990, the US ranked sixth in the world for its levels of  health WE HAVE FALLEN OUTSIDE THE TOP 25....

Oh and lets not forget the real fly in the ointment (ointment that cost 60% more in the us than the rest of the world) your health care is tied to your employer... So when budget crunch time hits and your name pops up on the ol' excel sheet where ya gonna be then?

So please......  do some fucking research on the matter before you decide to chirp up k? I award you no points and may god have mercy on your soul you complete mouth breathing moron.
Lmao and what does that get me?

My Money at 9:30 Tomorrow: 💸
I don't trade short term, but my honest guess is that SP continues it's run, though more gradually, based on price action Friday. We have stimulus, potential deficit in index purchasing at closing cross Friday, potential FOMOing Benchmarked funds, also smaller tradeable float as of friday means demand is amplified going forward, also sentiment seems solid for Tesla with almost every trader or investor I know saying they would like to buy more Tesla on a dip... What this means is that a big dip may actually not occur again in the near future because a lot of people are wanting to get in still. I would not bank on a dip unless the macroenvironment changes drastically or Tesla fails to execute, which I don't see happening until potentially Q1 as that is a notoriously cyclical quarter for automakers. My advice if you want to invest long-term is to grab shares and forget about them for a few years. Hope that helps
Oh damn! Don’t jump haha
Dude $600 isn’t even enough for poors to buy a Gucci sweatshirt for Instagram pictures.

Thats the dream, but I wouldn't yolo in that way. Play it save, take your singles and your doubles and try not to lose money. it'll add up over time. if you can increase your portfolio by 50% each year from gains, and add a good chunk of your income to it, over time it will really add up.

They're just looking for new ways to control the populace now that we have a vaccine.
That’s correct
Governments aren't the only users, CVS and vaccine distribution tracking as an example. Other easy potential clients are all the blackwater type private war companies.   I don't see PLTR going away, just like I don't see them growing as quickly as most wsb people think. I'm long and would be happy to double or triple my money in the next 12-18 months.

TSLA
They have a killer cash runway- $600-700 million estimates on IV and fintwit- and lots of milestone payments rolling in from partners on program progress. 

But offerings are always a risk. I usually sell a covered call on some portion of my shares any time a biotech spikes. You can see from the screenshot I sold calls on 5 of 18 lots recently in this account.

As far as the price action- I’m not into conspiracy theories but the investor village echo chamber always cries “shorts” “manipulation” (translation: gay bears). This stock does have a sordid past from previous failures but the Heme A progress with Pfizer is undeniable evidence they are a clinical stage biotech player at this point.

Holy fuck it’s like you have never opened up a basic cell biology book. Go to nature.com and read up how a fucking virus. Better yet, read up on the natural courses for all viruses in this planet. Here a preview: they weaken over time. Fucking retard

“Though there’s the very rare chance a virus could mutate to be more aggressive, if anything, RNA viruses are more likely to mutate into a weaker version.

“Nearly all mutations will make some part of the virus work less well than before. The most common thing is for mutations to appear and die out again quickly,” said Dr. Benjamin Neuman, the head of the biology department at Texas A&M University-Texarkana.”

Facts
Just because we aren't buying and selling stock right now, it doesn't mean that other people aren't. People who participate in premarket or extended hours trading influence the price of stocks outside of normal trading hours. "Futures" in this context refers to an estimate of where the market will be at the opening of the next session based on activity that's going on right now. Here is a decent place to check: [https://www.cnn.com/business/markets/premarkets](https://www.cnn.com/business/markets/premarkets)

This is a good response and thank you for putting the time and effort into it. 

The problem I see with this is that by introducing doubt into the equation about the vaccine's theoretical unnefectiveness, we are alienating even more people from getting the vaccine than the huge proportion of antivaxxers in the US (which I am singling out because it is the epicenter of the COVID-19 crisis now) and throughout the rest of the world. The fewer people take the vaccine, the less of an impact it has on the reduction of transmission and building immunity in the general population. 

There are always possibilities of failure for every system. The best we can do at this point is trust the experts but keep skepticism to what they say (much like when the CDC's Fauci claimed the masks didn't work at the beginning of this epidemic.) Even if this strain takes over, the vaccine will be effective against the remaining strains and being able to fight off 1 with an out of date vaccine against both dominant strains would be better than succumbing to both world wide.

The strike is bit above what I would consider reliable. Stock would have to increase roughly 30% between now and June, which I definitely think is in the realm of possibility, especially if the tariffs get repealed by early April, that'll give you 10% right there. 30c is a bit above what my risk tolerance is, but it's not retarded, just depends on your own risk tolerance.

We play the same way. Did I win or no? That's what I care about. Not if I was able to solve a crossword puzzle.
I personally think so, I'm just putting more into ARKG as somewhat of a diversification. I've got almost $150k in ARK funds. Most of which is in ARKK from when I bought in back in March that I talked about above. But the other 40k is split evenly (currently) between ARKW and ARKG. 



I would suggest checking out the various funds [here](https://ark-funds.com/arkk#fundmaterial) and choosing whichever one you think aligns for you. Read the prospectus in how each fund invests and the top companies in their portfolio.
>We have a history of net losses, we anticipate increasing expenses in the future, and we may not be able to maintain or increase profitability in the future.

Just gotta give it some time. DASH is a recognizable name so a lot of retail buy into it following the IPO, and fomo'd in on Friday causing a rally. Friday probably looked like a decent entry for people that know nothing about the company's fundamentals or business model, and they just thought "I'll buy the dip". 

Keep in mind that their own investors privately valued DASH at $16BB in June of this year, and the market cap is at 52.8BB right now, following losses in Q3. The valuation they received at 16BB was following Q2, their only profitable quarter since the company was founded.
Ok cool........
They honestly shouldn't have released on last gens, it's a bewildering business decision to support an already dead legacy product with a rapidly shrinking userbase that's incompatible with all other release platforms that will actually be supported for more than six months.

You may be the only person who actually paid attention to maybe the most important thing about stimmy rather than crying about a free 600. Limiting the fed ability to backstop markets and require senate approval could be devastating at least to sentiment

Missed opportunity. They should legit give a hundo for every vaccine dose you receive.
I can't tell if some of you have a very big clit or a small penis
I agree that it is expected this virus will mutate.  The interesting thing about VUI 202012/01 is that it has acquired 17 mutations.  The new variant has mutations to the spike protein that the three leading vaccines are targeting.  Among the 17 are eight mutations in the gene that encodes the spike protein on the viral surface, two of which are particularly worrisome. [1]  For me it is still too early to say with certainty that VUI 202012/01 will not have any impact on the vaccines.  Most likely the vaccines will still work, but I wouldn't say that with certainty until we have more data. 

Ewan Birney - Deputy Director General of EMBL and Director of EMBL-EBI
there are good, principled reasons to think that the vaccines - that stimulate both B and T cell immunity - will give us protection to a variety of strains, this one included. But ... we should definitely check

https://virological.org/t/preliminary-genomic-characterisation-of-an-emergent-sars-cov-2-lineage-in-the-uk-defined-by-a-novel-set-of-spike-mutations/563

Conclusion
We report a rapidly growing lineage in the UK associated with an unexpectedly large number of genetic changes including in the receptor-binding domain and associated with the furin cleavage site. Given (i) the experimentally-predicted and plausible phenotypic consequences of some of these mutations, (ii) their unknown effects when present in combination, and (iii) the high growth rate of B.1.1.7 in the UK, this novel lineage requires urgent laboratory characterisation and enhanced genomic surveillance worldwide.

Im gonna take a stab at this and say not 1 person in this sub actually NEEDS the stimmy. People who really need the help are not gambling in the stock market. If they are well then they don't deserve help.
charity and welfare are good but don't forget the point of the stimulus is not to be a handout, it's a defibrillator for our dying economy

There's going to be a Democrat in the white house soon and Republicans would love for the market to crash so they can blame the Democrat. However they need to win those pesky elections in Georgia first so they had to pass a stimulus in hopes that would buy them enough votes in the short term to retain power. 

In other words, there's another stimulus happening right now. If you think said stimulus is the catalyst that will finally cause PLTR to bleed off and die, then God speed fellow retard.
Then why can't we buy calls at$26?
wow man. Big D is right. And you blaze extracts. Nice.

Hope you only smoke the good stuff, godspeed you beautiful retarded bastard.
If it makes you feel better I got a 100 shares and wouldn’t sell calls at that price
Got in September calls for $125 when AAPL dipped to $113 late November. Up almost 100%. Gonna ride it out
Reading into it a bit more, I see what you mean. But it still seems like the stimulus we're talking about is unique. Keynesian stimulus seems different than direct monetary injections (helicopter money) which I thought was more modern monetary theory type economics.

Well.. my RH account is about 10% in options. Most of that is leaps and a little is puts on DASH. Also buying lots of shares of a SPAC I think will do very well, and buying some leaps on that as well. I definitely don't want to lose anything. I hope some of these newer high risk plays start returning money soon. Timeline for my SPAC play is 3 weeks til merger. I think it could 2-3x in a few months after the merger if the market stays the way it is. If it does 3x, my portfolio will about double. And that would be very cool of course. But all this work and I just double my portfolio. Its so hard to get 20x. And even at 20x, I'm not at retirement money. I'm at not poor as shit money. I'd still need to 10x my portfolio from there to be at retirement money. fml.

January though is going to be March 2.0. Circuit breakers ever week baby. Buy them calls up until the 31st and then get out of all your bullish play boys.
Why???

I bought Sony calls weeks before earnings and they went down.  Held til day before earnings and cut them loose.  Sony posted 400% beat and fuckin mooned.
Someone once had I think 1.5 mil before they lost it. Somebody did some calculations if he were to put it in a dividend ETF, SCHD (This was at March bottom as well). It’d return 30-40k. A year without him doing anything. Depends on where you live and etc. that’s low for so people but where Im living you’d be plenty set. Decent house in a safe neighborhood. Work a few more years and let it DRIP it’d grow fast.

I put 5k into spy calls the day before the election. It was a nice day. The following weeks were all losses though
I'm serious, because I would have thought stimulus would be more of a modern monetary theory thing. So I think you're full of shit, but I'm open to being educated if you aren't talking out of your ass.

I don't think Keynesian economics has anything to do with stimulus, please inform me.
it's possible they did

even if they did it doesn't mean the same thing will happen again
Wat time
They definitely deserve it, but I'll bet they'll recover in a year or two. Blizzard released the worst expansion for WoW ever and they tanked super hard, enough to get investigated. Cut to now, 3 years later, and they're hitting new highs. Video games industry doesn't give a FUCK

Two vaccines approved and another stimulus finally passed. Maybe we have a correction in a week, or a month, or three months. But if you're not more optimistic now than you have been in months, your brain is broken. Just use a robo advisor because your instincts can't be trusted.

Later, Bobby’s still busy doing ayahuasca.
Not much bro look at their holdings they are on the site. ARKG doesn’t even have TSlA and kills it. TSLA is max about 10% of other ARKs so that’s not enough weight to pull a failing portfolio along. Their other choices have been solid as well.

Aggressively bought fedex June 300C on Friday.  Stock was down 5% and the option oversold down 32%. Listened to their ER call, they are expecting this upcoming quarter to be their best quarter ever even with them just beating eps by 20%. Also the upcoming quarter will include Black Friday and cyber Monday along with holiday season. Typically their holiday season ends around Jan 1, they expect it this year to end by Jan 19. It’s going to be one hell of a blowout quarter and at $275 it is a freaking steal.

Also aggressively buying TAK $20C leaps, they are dirt cheap and auntie cathie woods has been buying everyday 

Lastly more into $coty, options are cheap and this should easily move from 7 to 10 next quarter
I hope

1. Actually cockholic, viruses do mutate all the fucking time and I assume by “stronger” you’re referring to the mortality rate. While it appears that yes, the new strain has no effect (yet) on mortality, unfortunately smooth brain retards like yourself forget that even with all the existing measures in place, we’re already going into a second round of lockdowns. Any increase in infection rate (Ro) will only make shit exponentially worse. 
2. If you’re such a epidemiology expert, explain to me why the majority of vaccines are only needed once and the flu vaccine is needed every year. 
3. Fuck you guy

Yup that’s basically me right there. I just started my first post-grad full-time job in IT this year so now have a decent amount of money to invest. Most goes into 401k and roth and in safe stuff like AMZN or AAPL but I also have shares or occasionally options in some meme stocks like PLTR, GME and a couple SPACs though it doesn’t represent much of my portfolio
What is your point?
50, which is all they can win, is not a majority.  Before you retards say "yeah it is, with Kamala casting the deciding vote", the dems are a loose colition with a lot of conservative-leaning, rural reps who are constantly afraid for their lives...er seats.  (Doug Jones anyone???).

>Bruh oil has gone up massively since biden won, rig is up 100% this month.

So, 1, that isn't true. Rig opened at ~2.02 at the beginning of the month (December) and is not $4 and 2, it wasn't true a month ago when in November 20th it was $1.40 which would be $2.80. Rig was going up before Biden's win actually and hit it's low early November where people realized that it was basically free money due to the base price of this stock hovering around (get this) $2.50. You can look at the historical charts to see so not only are you "an idiot" but you clearly are too vested to see your own empirical data validated. Unicorns don't sprout from shitpiles.

>Trump was big oils worst enemy.

Doesn't mean much for RIG which is a foreign company and almost the complete opposite of "big oil". Maybe Whiting would make more sense, sure, but RIG has zero to do with Trump and more to do with the OPEC situation. Of course, you, being you, wouldn't know that. 

>You are such an idiot its hilarious, something massive is coming.

No. Something massive *came*. You should have sounded the alert when it was under a dollar. It has quadrupled since then. But this the base price presuming it doesn't return to pre-corona levels based on the evolution of EV and the slowed industrial sector for quite some time.

E: If you haven't noticed *I played RIG*.

I've reviewed the VMWare alert for this issue. While it should be patched ASAP with the available patch it's not a huge problem and was only exposed because of the Solarwinds problems. IE because they leaked security tokens and credentials for all sorts fo things, VMWare included.

Got you. I also have a position, just basic 30 delta strangles already rolled at 50% profits a couple of times. What premiums are you selling them for or how many contracts are you selling for $3000
Some people don’t like constantly moving around. It works if you’re single, without friends and not a lot of things. Imagine having to move all your shit without losing it all the time. Let’s say your friend are in Portland, but you’re in Miami. How do you visit friends? How do you raise a family with kids if you’re constantly moving?

I do think AirBnB is the future, but I think it’s ridiculous to think people still won’t have homes as their permanent residence.
Who else thinks PSTH wont be able to find a deal they like? Tbh im not a big fan of bloomberg if that happens.
for the retards who don't understand how unemployment works:

Federal supplement of 600/week ran out in July.

State unemployment can extend much longer, but with far fewer benefits, because it's stretched over a longer period of time. Florida, for example, maxes out just over $200/week. Just enough for some PLTR and whiskey to wash down the calls.

Most people's state unemployment has since run out, and those who still have it only have a week or two left.

200/week for 30 weeks is $6,000 for example.

Yet another top indicator, been seeing the bulls on here actually thinking this shit is predictable for too long. Reset time baby.
Ever since Cramer greenpilled me saying he loves it when people are negative and bearish because that means there are more people to convert and squeeze, bearish means upside. Thinking about it this way lets me navigate this sub and the 500 futures chat because it made me realize that bears are almost always wrong. Yeah bulls are stupid and have no legit reason for believing what they believes, but bears are just wrong all the time every night. Until "the crash" happens, I can't listen to them because I see them get eviscerated every day while retard BTFDBOOOOIIII stuff their wallets and don't even know why it is happening.

It’s not just belief. PLTR is trading sideways and I make 4,000-5,000 weekly selling premium on 100 contracts. I do the same with 3 TSLA contracts. TSLA is different and defies logic, so I just set my call strikes  $200 above the Monday price at closing. Just prefer to keep my portfolio simple and basic. Just sell far OTM covered calls, so I keep my shares and just sell premium on options that always expire worthless.

Same. But as the saying goes, keep your seat on the airplane but make sure it’s in the exit row.
Might be red at first then green once they actually pass it.  Also they've been pamping saying this is just the start and more stim coming next year.  SPY 400 incoming.
It tasted like pennies

RemindMe! 9 months
How is the fact that these luxury items are sold out everywhere, and re-sell above retail value, made up?  I picked the most obvious examples that you can easily check for yourself.  Hell a new set of the sneakers just came out this weekend and were instantly gone.  Tens of thousands sold when retailers limit people to one per person.

You do understand that the stimulus payment isn't "free money" right and is an advance on a tax credit?  And that you will almost certainly pay much more than you received in the coming years in the form of increased taxes and prices from retailers.
I bought in on Friday lmao
I work at a FedEx facility, we’re currently running about 60k on average daily, FedEx has a way more systematical and efficient way of sorting/loading packages though.

Edit: 60k for just the North/west sides of Portland, Oregon.

It blows my mind how many complaints there are about PDT. If you don’t have $25k, it’s not lack of day trading that’s keeping you from making money.
Dxy
You’re right. I don’t. I don’t want to miss the rocket up. I missed on zoom, and draftkings, peleton and tesla. I’ll diamond hands this till at least $100 maybe 3.
Plot twist! That was his wife's boyfriend's hand
Probably only 20%
What will pump the markets now that we don't have vaccine or stimmy news??
Does this mean that weed bill would have a chance to pass then?
Actually TSLA shorts have to have a lot of conviction to still retain their positions. Respect.
Lol but why will it go up ?
We do. That’s why we call out the politicians and people call you Pro Trump racist bigots.
I'm still bullish on it but rather wait for confirmation that it wants to get stupid.  Might pull back more than people think.
same lol

Nope lol
You get the stimulus if your income is below 75k
ok so until then i'll keep buying calls

Sounds like the exact problem they have at the White House this month. Mango is acting just like that batshit-crazy ex you told to move out, but you gave her a little bit of time to find a place to go.
Granted.  It's AAPL harvesting season.
As someone who works in real estate, there is no way for opendoor to truly revolutionize the home buying process. Every home and piece of land is unique. Every municipality is different. Its not a commodity and their wizbang tech cant turn it into one.

Phase 3 ongoing, projected readout and submission ‘22 and approval late ‘22 early ‘23. Pfizer just presented data at ASH ‘20, and there was a strong dose dependent response and higher factor levels with better duration than BMRN. A small sample set but compelling data. High dose= high clotting factor levels.

I’m calling BULLSHIT! Zero WSBs posts in your post history. Zero interaction with WSBs in your comments. It’s fairly certain WSBs didn’t “make this happen”! Tell us, seriously, did you suck dick for that ring?
You lost all respect at the last sentence
$230000 on one play? Even if you believe in the stock you could diversify in to something else that could pay you even higher premium on covered calls/puts.
It's down less than 0.5%. Considering how much it's been mooning lately, that's nothing.
You looking for someone to fuck your wife so you don't miss out on more profits? Let me know my wife's boyfriend has a lot more to give.

XLE is actually the main culprit to S&P being down. Yeah, ever thought about that? Bear fuk.
if you think that the hedge funds havent perdicted this event you are wrong.
I have 130 calls I really hope so.

Sell tomorrow at open and get puts. Its time to jump the gun and load up on puts. I'm normally a bull but when 1 trilly in stimulus passes and futures are still red? Then u have no EU UK deal, a new strain of covid running wild in UK, countries closing down travel with UK because of how bad it is as well. Eu markets shitting atm. A vaccine was approved over the weekend, and a 1t stimulus and pj traders are still red. Dont forget Republicans took away jpows printer.
I use TD Ameritrade so not sure. The implied volatility on the OpenDoor options chain is pretty high so be careful - think though they just opened up leaps so maybe something there to look at
And the stock is gonna drill tomorrow lol. Shareholders do not like acquisitions

Never quite understood this. If it goes well, you’re gonna do what? Throw a more extravagant party? For a bunch of ungrateful asshats taking bets on who’s gonna be your wife’s boyfriend after she leaves your retarded ass? Jesus Christ you’re fucking stupid.

All that can come of this is that your future ex-wife is going to realize she just married a degenerate willing to throw money meant for a very special event to do what with it? Yolo it for fake internet points? Super sweet bro.

I like to laugh at the idiots in this sub, myself included. But for real, take your tendies, go to the courthouse to get hitched and take a two week honeymoon almost anywhere you want with what you already have. Or not. You’re the retard.

An investment where you are guaranteed a zero return and will most likely lose 2/3 of your net worth within 10 years.  Yep, marriage is a great deal, for her (and her boyfriend).
No they really really dont. its fucking pathetic... I mean taxes aside and Europe having health care just look how much we fucking pay for it.... we pay out the fucking ass and its SHIT health care by any measurable standard.

Stop fear mongering retard. Viruses don’t mutate and become stronger, they become weaker. We have a vaccine that’s protein based and therefore good for all Covid strains including futures ones. I swear the people who post here are all smoothbrains

I mean don't take my word for it, listen to the articles reporting on it and the proffesionals involved:

[-Healthline.com article](https://www.healthline.com/health-news/why-you-shouldnt-freak-out-about-the-new-strain-of-covid-19)

[-Gaurdian.com article](https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/dec/19/what-is-the-new-covid-strain-and-will-vaccines-work-against-it)

-[US News article](https://www.usnews.com/news/top-news/articles/2020-12-19/uk-says-new-coronavirus-strain-is-more-infectious-but-vaccines-should-still-work)

"Britain's Chief Scientific Adviser Patrick Vallance said COVID-19 vaccines appeared to be adequate in generating an immune response to the variant of the coronavirus."

"[Brian Labus, PhD, MPH, an assistant professor in the School of Public Health at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas] concurred with Hancock’s assessment, saying it’s unlikely that the new strain will affect whether the vaccines work"

"Melissa Nolan, an infectious disease expert and professor at the University of South Carolina, said the coronavirus vaccine designers expected that the virus would mutate and have included various predictions of viral strains."

But sure, I guess all hope is lost and we will have another 18 months of covid because it does what it always did a little bit faster. 

And all hope is lost because of an event we saw happen literally 8 fucking months ago in Italy and why the current strain of covid is not the same one as originally discovered and the vaccine still works against it.

Absolute dumbasses can just say shit and no one calls them out on it anymore, I swear to Christ. Maybe it would be better for these illiterate morons to roam the street maskless and just take big mouth breathing gulps of air, at least then their lungs would be so full of fluid we wouldn't have to listen to their horseshit for a few weeks.
If you think the tesla run wasnt a short squeeze to infinity you are a joke. If you actually think the pandemic is real you are human garbage and there is no need to continue this conversation since you are literally retarded. This was not some magical moment where we decided we were goong electric, it was one of the most shorted stocks in history getting caught in a feeding frenzy that caught momentum. Once this shit crashes in a year I will remember this and laugh at you. Get your money out dumbass, tesla isnt even going to lead the electric revolution. Yes we will be goong electric, but because of efficieny. If you knew anything you would also know battery production is worse for the environment than any concievable method of burning gas. Please fuck off you dinwitted fuck.
The Senate would’ve passed it. They’re playing hardball now that Trump lost. The reason why they didn’t pass the Heroes Act was because it had a bunch of things concerning voting (ie bad for 🥭’s election chances) and they don’t like the idea of sending a ton of money to blue states and governments. Nancy wouldn’t even compromise and send another bill without making some concessions. It was literally this is it or nothing type of approach.
Randomly bought $500 on dogecoin and I am up 35% lol

Which one of you retards went all-in on SLV like me?

🤑
Tesla tho
Just from looking at the daily chart if it breaks too far below $18 it will be rip down hard, but if it breaks through to high $20 it could have a chance to run up. Probably the safest bet is to wait for it to get up to $21 or $22. I'll throw in $1000 worth of leap tomorrow and see if this is the bottom of a reversal to vahalla or the start of spiral to $rope
He spoiled himself. Don't judge.
Can't wait for you to get crushed.

One day you might even realize you don't know anything about short term price movement. As if the big boys who move the market didn't already figure this out.
Aapl probably
I don't have a tax return for it because I started working after first stimmy and I was claimed as a dependent then
Guys please be very careful following this DD. It may make sense and be solid DD, but as all you know meme stocks not falling that easy, especially during COVID. February calls are too close, so there is a huge risk.

Normally I don’t care for these but this one made me laugh pretty hard. Thank you.
TSLA shorts are pussies. They have no conviction. Just scared hiding ina corner finger on the button to cover. If they put on any real size maybe theyd get somewhere.
400 EOW.
Nobody’s really factoring it in yet but if the Dems win the run off in Georgia. It could send the market into a frenzy...Or it could send us to the moon. The stimulus package would be like $5 trillion if the Dems have all three branches!
Could this OIL recovery be a huge trap, come January.

Record the whole thing in case she calls the cops and falsely accuses you. 

In this day and age, women can say anything and men will be guilty until proven innocent.
On a single trade? Bought 100 shares of TSLA at 800 (pre split price) back in March, on margin. Got margin called and had to sell it all when it was down at around 450. Feels even worse taking that $35K loss since if I held it til now it would have been a $260K gain

Over the same time period I bought the TSLA shares and got margin called, my entire port went from $44K to -$5K, not fun times
pretty much
Market reacts to size of stim bruh. $600 is less than what was priced in
Give us that insider info bitch

Nah it's the same disease. We already killed off the weak ones, so it's gonna be okay

Something like this is entirely possible.  There is a school of thought that when the TSLA bubble pops it'll drag down the index a lot.

Hey there, I don't know if you're still browsing this thread, but do you think there's gonna be any significant dip in price in the coming days after S&P inclusion? That stimulus check just passed, and I sold off my shares Friday at the peak, so I could use some advice.
For now ..
Shitty investment indeed.
Someone's bumhole is going to gape tomorrow, hopefully.
Calling it now : gap up and trend up at open, the moment the thing gets signed down during the day -1%

Yeah, that means Chargepoint will benefit most. Have you not even taken any time to look at Blink? The CEO makes a much as the company does, that means not bode well for anyone that puts their money in their hands. 

Saying Blink will go up because of charging stations being a priority is like saying Enron will go up because energy is a priority. Blink is a scam meant to enrich their board with our money.

Again, incredibly large generalization coupled with anecdotal evidence that could just as easily be made up.

If you work for an asset manager that manages public pending money, or most large banks, you have to give access to and report the holdings of all your investment accounts, and your spouses, and anyone family who live in your household. Also most require you to preclear any trades beefier execution, and carry a list of restricted investments which you can't buy or sell. Additionally they may have holding periods which prevents from selling anything you've bought within 60 days unless it's for a loss.

I will be keeping it for the long haul. Stock was already depressed before the fines hit and then it went even lower. I don't think the political risk will last, but on the other hand, speaking against the Party like Jack Ma is a huge no-no over there and may have spooked the investors a bit.

I like that it is not smokey. Drinking whiskey you just take it for granted that all hard liquors for sipping are smokey or peatey
1.9b included blanket liability protection for corporations, which Democrats really don’t want.  Think market response is a little muted because those protections weren’t included in the bill.

They gave up state and local aid and $600 per adult to keep them out there, which sounds about right for a negotiation.

If you work hard, you will have a great life compared to 99.9% of all humans that have ever walked the earth. Why do you think everyone wants to leave their 3rd world country to come here?
It was not in the post because it’s mostly rumors. For a long time CEO Sandy Macrae said they wanted to go it alone and basically be the next giant in pharma, but recently at an investor conference type thing he said they are open to anything that increases shareholder value, and referenced a company that was bought out. Lots of reading between the lines there, but Biogen already owns 17% so people think of them, or PFE who is partnered. Or any of the other partners. Mostly rumors so I didn’t elaborate, but the mere *possibility* of a buyout on the table may be what brought this stock to life in the last couple weeks. Before then no need to price in a buyout premium.
You are literal cancer.

P.s. climate change is a hoax made up to get the USA to cripple itself while china doesnt give a fuck and makes more pollution than anyone.

Lmao his hands look feminine
I was bullish on this stock pre-meme status. It can fall back to $17 and I’d be fine. Maybe this is an early bubble. I’m half tempted to sell and buy back at $20 or $17. But there is enough interest to keep it stable for now and any and I mean any good news becomes a huge catalyst. The government contracts are just the appetizer. The real tendies will come from the Fortune500 companies utilizing their apps. Their growth potential is astronomical. I’m stock holding. I think options are a bit too risky at the moment.

I didn't make any of that up.  Those items are all luxury goods and all sold out everywhere.  Not EVERYONE needs a stimulus payment, people earning $80k/year got one last time.  

I see "now hiring" signs everywhere, has been that way for months.  I'm sorry for people who lost 60k jobs but there is plenty of work that would allow them to get by.  The healthcare providers actually fighting the pandemic aren't getting a bonus so the person sitting on their couch turning their nose up at available service jobs shouldn't either.

I'm getting pretty tired of the US gov't rn. What would an instant 600 and 300 weekly (11 weeks total) even do for most Americans facing eviction or hunger? this same bill handicaps many of the Feds economic toolkit which would kill any future stimi or 'economic plans' the dems could have in store (if majority in senate) such as green energy, infrastructure, education, etc... This bill is very much sell the news and as much as I'd hate to see any more Americans starve or homeless but this bill isn't the answer. I'm more bullish if this package fails and dems land georgia in the run offs but I'm worried how many Americans can last that long.

TLDR: if bill passes short term bull into long term bear. If bill fails short term bear into long term bull

I thought this too. Then I started thinking. The spike protein is how it attaches to host cells. The vaccine works on this specific spike protein. If rate of transmission has changed, maybe the method of infection has also changed--the spike protein.

Interestingly, first stimulus was before the split and TSLA was 1200 at the  time. That first stimulus in 1 share of TSLA would be worth almost 2800 now

If you’re flipping houses correctly you’re buying off market, and giving sellers a low cash liquidity bid for their property. This is the definition of successful property flipping. Unfortunately, with tiny gross profit margin you’re doomed to fail. Gross profit margin needs to be 20-30%.

Open door is absolutely a glorified house flipper.
Doesn't matter, markets will sell off/trade sidways leading up to it simply due to uncertainty.

Mr. Softy is the term historically given to Microsoft, due to a rough pronunciation of the ticker MSFT. Mr. Softee is a company that sold ice cream. Microsoft did a vouch of confidence with supplying backend intrastructure to GME stores, and giving GME a stake of XBox subscriptions.

Dr. Shoeless Supercuts is Dr. Michael Burry, a hedge fund founder of Scion Capital, known for his role shorting the housing market by looking at the data, made famous in the film The Big Short. In the film, there is a line "So Mike Burry of San Jose, a guy who gets his hair cut at SuperCuts, and doesn't wear shoes, knows more than Alan Greenspan and Hank Paulson?"  
Burry's firm this year disclosed a large stake buying up GME stock, which drew attention due to his fame for being correct on numbers with the housing crash, and for this time being long instead of short.

Not if you sell for profit
Did u copy/pasta this from Stocktwits?
Thats one specific tax. I'm also glad you pointed it out. Social security is only taxed on the first $100K of earnings, that means those with less money pay a higher percentage of their income. We could lower that tax if we applied to all earnings and it would result in a effective tax cut for the majority of the country while still fully funding SS. This is a great example of how right wing policies in this country have shifted tax burdens onto the middle and lower class and away from the wealthy.

well yes that's their job
Yeah give us spce strikes and dates, we'll accept you if they print, if not ban
Why
I don't think you get banned for bad words. I put that rule in. It's not because we don't like bad words, it's because Reddit is banning people *permanently on the whole site* for saying certain words if people hit report on it.

We've got two choices. Either let you say whatever and let you get banned, or just have automod spam your comment and go "bro they'll ban you, pls don't". We opted for the second one after a bunch of people started getting banned.

We tried to make the automod responses about it very clear that this isn't something we're cool with but y'know.. aint nobody read.
I don't have a lot of patience for losing trades. Need shit to run in my favor quickly or I don't hold. Been fucked too many times "holding" aka hoping
Depends what trap you mean.

It's the name I used over a decade ago to get past the sad panda. If you get that, it's the first one. If you don't let's stick to option 2.
I’d order take out from the place with the good chicken parm instead of the place with the better cost/quantity ratio.
It’s true innit

Yeah KO isn’t meant for growth tbh. It’s a very mature company that people buy for the dividend with medium to small growth. Pretty much a proxy bond. It has its place in portfolios...like dividend focused ones. Not to bad of a hold of you want a yield engine. If I was retired I’d hold a lot of KO, PEP, and ABBV. A heavy mix of those 3 in a retiree’s portfolio will yield around 3.5-4% depending on your weighting and that’s a pretty solid yield.
Gay ring but congrats

Flipping houses for 4-7% gross profit margin? You need a bare minimum 15% gross profit margin minimum to scale a house flipping business. 20-30% is ideal. Open door takes on the risk of owning and flipping the home and end up with the same margins the brokers split at closing.

There’s a reason house flipping is historically a local niche operation. Doubt they will make money long term.

PS: Most house flippers provide instant liquidity, that’s how they snatch the below market purchase price from the seller.

It seems Microsoft's business model is to be 6 months late to every internet technology trend, then try to compensate by cramming their solution up your ass through Windows updates, whether you want it or not. The "rape them until they love you" model.
Bloomberg LP denied it though

In that case, countries should shut down for another 3 years. Imagine the amount of money people will save up during that time. The economy would boom 3 times as much maybe more of this effect is exponential.

You need a 15% gross profit margin minimum to scale a house flipping business. 20-30% is ideal. Open door takes on the risk of owning and flipping the home and end up with the same margins the brokers split at closing.

The personal savings rate is at its highest point since 1975. When the vaccine becomes more widely available, people will start going back to work and those who have been saving will start spending. Essentially, the economy will be robust with consumer optimism. Even with the market reaching new highs, I still believe that we’re more likely to see an economic expansion similar to that after World War II as opposed to another collapse.

And ppl don’t realize that iron is a physical commodity those futures are not traded that heavily.  They follow the physical spot price.  That means there’s true physical tightness.  That takes months to unwind.  It has to be mined, processed, shipped etc. plus mine capacity cannot be turned on/off overnight.  That’s good because prices will remain elevated for some time.  However it also means the profits will take time to “trickle through” VALEs books.  I’ve seen this trade before.  Be careful it may not run by 1/15.

Cheat Code for degenerates: any time a popular growth stock has a big share offering and drops 10-15%, load up after the drop. It usually bounces right back into the range it was in before the drop. This has worked for me a bunch of times. Lately with PLUG and NIO. FWIW

Futes forgot the safe word
I suppose the counter-argument is that they are only currently targeting the rich because the means of production aren’t up to spec to sell to the general public. Once that happens, and they’re selling at prices commensurate to other manufacturers, they will be the iPhone of cars. Smart phones were not widely adopted in they’re early years. 

Apple always did tend to brand themselves as the superior, more expensive product; much like Tesla. Sure, the narrowing of the gap will take longer with such a large scale product, but that doesn’t mean it won’t happen.

Yes. Selling Cost Plus took a year. They just got rid of Christmas Tree shops but they are going to lease out the building next to the main office where the finance and operations division was. They are desperate to get rid of buy buy baby but no rumors on that yet. The C suite isn’t really concerned with Harmon Face Values as they aren’t a topic of discussion which is really weird.

It depends on which one one you get. I got the slightly uncomfortable one but I know others who got the one goes up to your brain. It just depends on what test kits they have on hand.
Uncomfortable, i swab once weekly for a cdc study, it goes in slightly past where you would want to pick your nose

Nah that 50% divorce rate is boomer stuff.  That was back when the wife would get railed by the cable man and runnoff with half of hubby’s XOM, T, and IBM shares.

About the new mutant virus - New strain of virus is 70 per cent more transmissible but seemingly no more deadly after its detection in UK and elsewhere and the current vaccine still work on them. So I wouldn't be worry about the "new virus" as long the current vaccine is good.

When the vote goes through the house there will be a bump and when the senate passes it another one. That seals it and I believe we will see a lot green tomorrow

On the flip side, a low margin, labor intensive business like deliveries or taxis probably will never succeed unless they achieve massive economies of scale. Unless of course, you restrict the number of drivers, which has its own problems.

Amazon probably is implied to open green right now with futures down. Wouldn't be surprised if that's up a few percent this week. Everything going right for it - possible lockdowns, stimulus check for purchase of items, Christmas, etc.
So is Tesla fucked tomorrow or we mooning all the way to $800 ?
So there is an unknown of how well the services you purchase will perform for we’ll say catastrophic issues. As an example, I don’t have any experience with how my car insurance handles wrecks, fortunately there are enough people who do get into wrecks that I can look up their reviews. With an event of this scale, there aren’t reviews, as it’s unprecedented in scope.

How they are handling it, the skill of the investigators, etc, demonstrate their competency, which is easier to sale compared to unchallenged promises from others.

Most taxes have fallen precipitously since the 60s? We cant afford anything since wages functionally stagnated. What you're talking about has more to do with the erosion of labor power and the rise of right wing economic theories like the laffer curve and trickle down.

That's the thing you boomer bears don't get, nobody here is longing GME in the next 5-10 years. Hype aside, most people who bought or buy now will sell next year. The entire narrative revolves around January announcement of holiday sales and March earnings report. You will see massive spikes in price followed by massive sell-offs.Sure, you will have those that hold through highs and don't sell even when it reverts back to lower prices than it is now, but those are edge-cases, some of them probably even done intentionally to farm internet points.

And don't come to me with that "but it's a dying business, so how $30 hurr durr" bullshit. TSLA is making what, like 1% margin right now, barely breaking even?! Yet they have the most fanatical cult of investors by far and stock just keeps going up and up and up based on nothing but blind faith and conviction. Sure, it will eventually crash and fall down, but many people have already made fuckloads of money on it this year.

Market is NOT driven by logic or fundamentals, it's driven by psychology and sentiment. Right now, the sentiment behind GME is getting increasingly positive day by day and we are going to see it continue in 2021.  


Unless Cohen and/or Bury sell off their position, then nobody fucking knows what's about to happen...

so what happens when you print more money? where does it go? it doesnt just sit in a bank to collect 0 interest. meanwhile last i checked there is still only one amazon, one apple and one TSLA. so u get asset inflation. invest in good companies and make sure u have a rainy day fund. this way if there is a crash u wont be forced to liquidate at lows.

What I'm saying is the end of day pump happens enough times that it literally could've pumped even if it wasn't for TSLA. If big money wanted SPY to moon, it will moon. If they want it to tank, it will tank. They control the market, we just go along for the ride.
Why do people think stimulus checks are supposed to be UBI? Its free money I don't care really

Yeah she’s crazy then and I don’t blame him
Yes, Friday's price action was absolutely a result of TSLA. It's not even up for debate. The 100's of billions that were bought by index's in TSLA had to come from selling other stocks. It's called rebalancing, and all they care about is tracking the index as closely as possible. It's why you sometimes see things sell off during IPO's as people sell one asset to buy the IPO.

Correct. It's pretty basic science, tho. It's basically like saying we know tires work on 5th Ave because we tested them on 6th Ave.

If $600 isn't enough for you, friendly reminder to buy PLTR and double it in a week.
Tech up, small caps down. Let's consult our blues clues to see if we can't deduce what would cause such a weird phenomenon. Could it, could it be virus fears?

If you have to ask this question you are in the bottom 1 percent of a bottom 1 percent sub.
If the market crashes tomorrow all of the “Dow up because of stimulus hopes” headlines will have been meaningless.

Bulls don’t pay.
Why
I bet cyber security stocks continue printing
Oh, thought some event was coming up. 

I mainly watch silver futures rather than SLV even though I have SLV calls. I don't know what the price difference is but Silver will have to get over $27.50 first before even thinking about $30. $27.50 could be the temporary top and we could see $23 again if it doesn't blow past it.

However, break through that and it should get to near the mid $30s, like 33-35 range. I'm hoping this is what happens.
$FEYE to $25 EOW.

Yep. It responds to the outer surface proteins. Likely mutations won’t change that aspect of the virus so vaccine will still work.

Just woke up from a nap. How much we getting?
market sold off because the funds that had to buy TSLA had to let go of other things. Obviously you have to sell before you buy, which explains the price action being so weird. The reason bulls are freaking the fuck out is because stimulus is a shoe in at this point and markets are not moving up.   


You guys make it seem like there is some mythical reason the markets move up or down when it's usually pretty fucking obvious.

The gold/silver price ratio currently sits at around 1:71 despite the metals coming out of the ground at a 1:9 ratio. Silver has way more uses than gold, including but not limited to, EVs, phones, cameras, mirrors, solar panels, medical equipment, medicine, computers, batteries, etc. Silver is extremely undervalued when we look at historical gold/silver ratio, how much is used per year (yearly deficit) and how it measures up against historical inflation as of late.

Niacin and pyridoxine are other B-complex vitamins found abundantly in the sunflower seeds. About 8.35 mg or 52% of daily required levels of niacin is provided by just 100 g of seeds. Niacin helps reduce LDL-cholesterol levels in the blood. Besides, it enhances GABA activity inside the brain, which in turn helps reduce anxiety and neurosis.

Worst financial decision ever.
Dollar to the moon, RIP bulls.
Yours isn't so bad. You learned a tough lesson and made it out. Sometimes when were down we get tunnel vision and throw everything we have on averaging down. I just did it myself last Friday on DASH puts. Sometimes when a stock is tanking(or pumping if you have puts) you just have to turn everything off and come back tomorrow when your heads clear
I hope CRWD has another Green Day tomorrow.

Ok. People. Let’s think about this. 600 bucks to everyone. Doesn’t seem like a lot but think about how inflation works. Stocks will go up because the dollar will be worth less. Not saying it’s permanent, it honestly might crash eventually but near term it’s going to stay and we’ll ATH again

I'd argue if you're confident on it tanking you would buy puts regardless of high premiums. A multi bagger with a high cost basis is gonna give you a lot more profit than super cheap contracts. And if you're concerned about theta, you could just buy long dated puts.

The movie was visually pleasing and at moments i was immersed in this world, but it was such an unsatisfying way the movie was wrapped up. This dystopia where corporations have power beyond the law is suddenly broken up by the otherwise absent police, the slums and class poverty issue is ignored, and it’s this disharmonious “feel good” attempt at an ending when the ruins of the society have really not been altered at all by the results of the game. Oh boy, a couple days a week with no game! Nothing is truly changed and it makes the whole movie hollow, especially because the movie tries to pretend like there’s been a happy ending for society. It’s truly insulting to the audience and garbage writing.
You son of a bitch, I'm in

No you're completely justified, I had to message my broker as they were assigned Friday morning at around 4am and I covered at open, broker had their shares back for the recording. It was unusual to have them assigned on the day of ex div and is why I thought what you did at first without clarification from broker. It had to do with the price of SPY whenever they were excercised, if it was over 371 my calls would have been exercised to cover those shares and I wouldn't be responsible for the div that way as well.

Not autistic at all. Silver gold ratio, how much silver is used per year and how inflation works.. we should be seeing $100+ silver at this time in history. Look into JPM silver trade spoofing. JPM (and every other bank)  buys a shit ton of physical silver but the price stays low. It’s because they manipulate the price to stay low. I think that’s coming to an end rn and we’re going to see an absolutely insane run up over the next few years. Very exciting. Been collecting physical for a few years now and I’m almost all in SLV calls rn on my options account.

reban this idiot
I (22M, big dick, dropshipping got me an 8 figure salary, fucking hate cats) recently allowed my cousin Jennifer (30F, breeder, ultra religious, unmarried) to move in with me after she was temporarily laid off (Starbucks).

This morning after I rolled out of bed and kissed my gf and her sister (25F, twins, DDD tits that I paid for, I like the sister more), I asked my chef Lucas (idk M, hot, gay) to whip up some eggs for us (scrambled, shredded cheese on top) and we were called to breakfast when it was ready (7:30am EST). My cousin trudged down the stairs and slopped her child-bearing belly baking her future crotch goblin onto the counter (Calcutta marble) as she sat down (I think I heard my Bistro 31” Swivel Bar Stool crack, should I sue?)

I politely asked if she was hungry, to which she snorted, licked her chops, and practically came as she said yes. Lucas scooped a couple spoonfuls of egg onto her plate (Le Frenchies Dessert Plates, gift from daddy) and poured her a hot cup of coffee (Haviland Brandenburg Gold Tea Set from Neiman Marcus, also a gift from daddy). She shoveled the eggs into her cakehole and asked who made breakfast while she waddled over to the pan (nonstick) to get more. I replied “Lucas”, to which she immediately started SCREECHING like a fucking banshee about how she didn’t want a insert bad word for gay touching her food. I grabbed a cup of water (Brita filtered) and used it to douse the fiery demon spewing hatred in my kitchen and immediately kicked her out.

My phone (iPhone 12 Pro Max, got it early) has been blowing up all day. AITA? :/

Edit: wow this blew up, don’t upvote Jennifer might see it, also the baby is mine, incest karma please?

Good taste
When you sell a put contract, you are taking the obligation to buy the shares only if executed.
If the person doesn't assign to you still owe the options, but you have to have enough margin available to cover the full value. If you don't, the bank can ask you to deposit more money or close the position and take the loss.
If the stock kept dropping (it did), I could have lost more.

Tesla went through a 2 or 3 week period where it kept dropping in value.
That was long enough for me to beljeve the shorts were going to win, so I took the loss.

Honestly thinking TSLA puts eod or Tuesday. The main catalyst for TSLA's 200 point rise over the last 1.5 months was entry into the S&P and the required buying by the index. With that done, I think people start taking profits. But also buying puts on TSLA is real stupid, so not sure that I will.
Good idea, I can make $100 and then turn it into 0 by next week!

Since you work in data, what makes PLTR better than anyone else?  Why can’t some new upstart with better programmers do this?  I mean PLTR has been at this for a while and haven’t turned a profit.  Why now? My concern is they went public to dump the company on baggy traders like many on this sub.  I worked on Wall Street for 20 yrs and know the game very well.   Retail is dumb money and smart companies sell to dumb investors.   Tell me why I’m wrong.

Watch Cramer’s interviews from 08-10(not mad money and not CNBC). He talks a lot about how institutions trade, their tactics and how they try to disrupt market psychology. Someone posted last week about how they worked for a larger corporation involved with market setting and went into detail how institutions beg, borrow and steal data as well as employing many other tactics that can influence people into making the wrong decision. Good luck on your tendies!

Yup, mine is also crowded. I never thought I'd have to wait in line at a BBBY of all places....
I mean its a lot smaller
Tbh I dont trust any futures
These comments made me love this sub
I’ll never leave
Unlike her probably
Always has been.
If you make just above 5 figures you a king in Bulgaria.. lmao.  Where some Hilfiger they'll blow you in a cab.. where some Polo they'll blow you at 2 in the afternoon on a park bench. edit ** wear - I'm fucking autistic, sorry
Yoloing weeklies is like the guy at poker night who keeps going all in on every hand and you let him buy back in every time then everyone except him leaves with money
Square focuses more on small businesses and cloud point of sales systems. They’re still shit at it tho.
It’s a hedge against bankruptcy.
This is not the way
everyday at work i “have to run to my car real quick” to make those morning plays lmao
Or a quick morning dump followed by a melt up. Buying likely not done this week or even maybe next week, mutual funds need to do their year end / new year rebalance as well
Buy calls bruh
Check a comment I made further down.  If CRISPR hasn’t made it obsolete, base editing for sure will.  Or has.   From a users point of view, ZFNs can make the cut, but there is a lot of other factors that make CRISPR superior, and even more so with base editing.
Giants defense is pretty nasty
Might be the worst earnings week lineup I've ever had the displeasure of seeing
Congrats!  Remember to set some aside for taxes too my dude
$8M in trades. Doesn’t mean $8M long. If you make 100 80k trades, then you traded 8M

No they always have it listed so it can get a bit messy if you're like me when you have multiple positions (long + options) opened
Square focuses more on small businesses at it's simplest form. Square also focuses heavily on in person transactions through their hardware.
What?
How bad is NYC. I was thinking of moving there legit to exp a year of my life
Nevermind i thought you got a weekly. i don’t see anything that’s 2 weeks away
I am a believer. The stock will be a couple hundred dollars over the next few years. I didn’t have the capital to begin with and started with $5000 and have been working my way up. I was using short term options to gain more money, but there could be a decent pull back at any time so I’m now buying options a few months out. Ultimately at some point I will put all the capital in shares.
HO HO HO

They didn't breakower than $95 on Friday

But the next dip IMO
sounds like addies
Congratulations mate! Just remember marriage is full of ups and downs, hopefully it’s a Tesla kinda relationship and not Luckin Coffee.
Guys I swear I feel like I am in a galactic simulation fuckery right now. 600 fucking dollars? One time? With this news, the stock market will pump up and the valuations of corporations would rise more in total than what the total stimulus deal is. This is just a wealth transfer, a theft in front of my eyes, how am I supposed to chill and work or meditate or even just see it happen?

Depends on what you wanna do
Just looked at them, yikes that chart is painful. Tritton comes from a retail store that was facing a similar predicament and he's moving in the right direction. I can only hope my shares don't end up at .20 cents apiece
If Disney had a different direction in mind I could see a buy out making sense for vertical integration and given how strained he business model is I could see them getting a pass on the monopoly concerns, but I just don’t see Disney doing it now with focus on Disney + and their own financial situation.
both
BOTH
Pretty sure he painted his nails and borrowed his moms ring.

Edit:  nice try/congrats. Whichever one applies
I need green tomorrow so I can buy puts for Tuesday
Well, even if it does it’s only a matter of time till it mutates in such a way that it doesn’t
the fear of inflation drives it down

that fear was just relieved when we passed a 900BN stim and senate republicans are already looking like they're going to be tightening up the budget (what else would republicans do when there's a democrat in office besides resist spending!?)
On DASH tho

You should have taken more profits

Retiring at 60 is early? Damn...

I mean if you want to just stop working entirely and just chip away at a savings account for the rest of your years, it depends a lot on your lifestyle. Some ppl will get away with a few hundred k, some need a few mil.

I personally will try to always have a business generating for me so I don’t have to “take a deep breath” with cash and hope it lasts longer than I do lol
You traded appreciating assets for a depreciating one?
Congrats retard.

Giants gonna lose
They turned the printer off
No real uptick or down-tick so far. Not feeling that bad now for not getting into position on Friday. Let’s spin it!
They are taking all the oil tankers they can and scrapping them to make steel.
I’ve started allocating a very small portion of my stack to buying the close and selling the open every day (index calls). The eternal futures pump is...real.
The way.
It’s pltrds sir
My SPY $376c printing tomorrow or should I sleep in?
Guys the NIKKEI is red. I’m going to fucking throw up. How will our boyz in Japan buy cool censored internet porn without market gains. This is fucked up.

There will 100% be another stimulus in late q1 early q2. 

You really think congress will block it rather then get something added for corporations? When spy goes 20% in the next 2 months you think republicans are going to be against more stimulus?

Oh no dude, I always love the contrarian case. I just wanted to engage anyone who found this useful enough to reply. God knows I’m not right about everything and if anything strongly changed my thesis I would hope that I’m enough of a badass to sell in a second. All input appreciated 👍
I dont love the chart however if a reversal does start soon 30 is more than reasonable to expect in the next 3 months
Damn, those calls are cheap! I'm in!

I agree with that, feel bad for the poor people who are struggling through all this. 

Very little sympathy for all my WSB bros buying at the high and selling at the low
Yeah, no stimmy for manletts.
technically i think that one is actually "Mode-RNA"
haha, vanguard, I fuckin hate vanguard
spx futures barely green

wsb: limit up!! BIRS FUKT
Construction and material making were deemed essential. It’s the only bright spot of the economy.  I don’t see lockdowns happening worldwide. Plus the market is a look ahead mechanism.  We have vaccines being jabbed in arms today with more coming. Therapeutics are much better now. Stimulus money approved today. Central banks in Europe are printing money too and going with negative interest rates.  This is a debate for another thread - but lockdowns don’t work.
For some reason I had a feeling about the jets when I saw that line. Took the cards and chiefs instead tho. One win and one push. Lost my parlay, but I play spreads
Must take skills to model a ring on your own manicured hands and take a pic from that angle.

Whats next weeks YOLO fellow retards?
I’m softer than a baby hug
I'll sell it to you. Rn guaranteed 1000
Lol bears never learn
Aye
I didn't say anything about their valuations. I don't care about their fundamentals. I day/swing trade very short term purely off technicals. There's a pattern with SPACs post merger and if the technicals are there, I'll take the trade. If they're not, I won't. Are you holding like 2 shares and need confirmation bias or something? Like wtf are you so defensive about? You clearly have no idea what you're doing since you thought PSTH went public in November through a SPAC...
I did this. You’re welcome.
You must be the head retard of the clang gang
Yeah. /NQ brings up the March nasdaq futures but it you add a letter you can see other ones.
Just lost a whole lot holding fed ex on earnings even though they crushed it. Lesson learned do not hold on earnings!

Better buy it at GameStop. Support your fellow autists.
If only freight transportation were so simple. Not every delivery is a profitable one for these companies which is why they offload the USPS for the last mile whoever possible. Margin squeeze won’t help the stock

So do adult dependents not get the $600? Can’t believe graduating college spring 2019 and getting claimed for those 4 months has cost me like two grand in stimulus lol
Yeah I just now realized that DD isn't the same as the daily discussion thread where shitposts are actively encouraged.  LOL.  The chances of this bet hitting are about the same as me having sex with Jessica Alba. I think tsla might dump but to $420 by Christmas is just retarded.
Yeah. Cali been on lockdown for over a week. But no one is following it. 

How they gonna enforce it if they wanted to? Police ain’t gonna do it.
Guck I better up tomorrow’s sell price to 800

Many people do not have the means to protect themselves and need the stimulus help. But LOADS of people piss away savings, over extend, take lavish vacations, run up credit card debt and put them selves in a spot they need a gov check.

Good news: Lockmart now owns the second biggest rocket engine manufacturer in the US

Worse news: Nobody can come within orders of magnitude of Raptor in cost, and SpaceX won't sell it.
You forgot about Biden stimulus talks going well that will start in a month. They’ve already started staying it.

Wouldn't it make sense to sell next year since this one was so good in term of gains. Chances are, 2021 will be less profitable.

Definitely don’t buy puts on Microsoft.

Microsoft has been playing cleanup crew on this. They have been taking actions to secure Command and Control (C2) networks used by the attackers as well as aid those that were affected.

We don’t know the full extent of who was utilized in the exploit chain and how, but Microsoft has been so proactive to aid and assist that it would be highly unlikely that they would find themselves on the negative side of public opinion.

Through this past week they have actually seen an increase in valuation, and are a logical choice to bid for SolarWinds properties in the event of a sell off. This also will be a selling point for Microsoft’s identity as a service (IDaaS) offering.
yes, yes you are. I'd suggest you start with the relationship between USD and oil.
No doubt they are but they would be considered to be the closest thing to mr orange man around.
One day we are going to have YOU MADE THIS HAPPEN picture of the proverbial yatch.

Your unbelievable. Your brokerage site froze ur account as a pdt because of the SEC ruling, not their own. That 60 day freeze is final, and that 60k would only allow you to day trade after the penalty is served.

When you go broke off high risk investments you’ll jerk off and try again because you have plenty of time to make it up. If you convince him to yolo and he loses his life savings hes built up for 40 years he will probably off himself. So you should probably think carefully before you advise him.
Stim check?
I'm sorry I am new to stocks, you didn't have 50k to buy the stocks so the brokerage took all your money (less than 50k) with loss? Did I understand correctly?

And if this is the case, can you trade in the future or once you make the difference they withdraw it from your account?
I would never do anything like this with a lot of money, it’s just for fun.

Now all the tendies are yours. Step 1 divorce wife. Step 2 collect all the tendies.
Yeah, I’m selling $15 strike CCs on my $9-something cost basis shares, and cashing out some now ITM ($8 and $10 strike) calls in order to buy a larger number of OTM LEAP calls and increase my overall delta.

In my opinion the ‘22 and ‘23 $20 strike LEAPs are still a deal.
Yep I got in during the $12s, but added in 17s and 20s  shares and calls. This will be big, but the calls concern me a bit. I think we have a rocket soon or after new year.

It is a BS assumption and a flawed way of thinking. It's like saying: "The last two IPOS opened at a 100% premium, therefore the next IPO will open at a 100% Premium." It's just degenerate. You have to look at a COMPANY, the industry, the valuation, the growth etc. to make a valid assumption about a future stock price, but definitely NOT how they go public 😂

I'm happy to be proved wrong. Most of the investors into this fund are betting on things they don't understand (e.g., what are the long term repercussions of CRISPR's lack of specificity, etc, which remain to be understood), and the price is going up as if everyone is letting CRISPR go ham on their bodies right now. Not to say these will not be solved, but who is to say these companies will provide revenue in two years, three years?

I'm not saying anything about long term projections or price targets lol I'm just saying it's common for SPACs to dip immediately post merger so I'm gonna try and make some money off that pattern.

If they're not there then I won't lol hell I might even pick up calls if it looks bullish instead.

Yeah I can’t understand it, and it concerns me some, but I’m assuming those gay bears know less than the big pharma partners do.

I mean that the underlying MSFT share price bounced back.  MSFT ain't no VMWare; had I known the scope of the intrusion better, I would have ran puts on VMW instead.

Got engaged during the pandemic as well. Woke up one morning in March took some advice from this sub, invested at the absolute bottom back in March held onto it till about June cashed out with a few grand in about an engagement ring.

I do agree though.

The strike price is pretty high. His calls are way out of the money and the expiration date is only 2 months away. PLTR has to go up about 90% ( $26 -> $48 roughly) for him to make mad tendies.

The pandemic has been going on for 10 months (since March).

&#x200B;

The 1st  stimulus was $1,200, and most folks got that in April. Unfortunately,  the 1st stimulus barely covered a single month of expenses for most people, but for argument's sake, let us assume it did. In fact, let's be generous and say it covered all of March and April (unrealistic, but let's argue it anyway). Assuming it did, that means there has been an eight (8) month gap, and our government thinks $600 can fill that void.

The top is 42... That's a market cap of Zillow. Anything more and lay them puts on. I'm rooting for a simple 35 which equals roughly 66% of Z market cap. Which is a fair enough price if you look at incomes of Z and open. Best estimate is 22-23b market cap hitting 35.

I think there’s a misconception that if you save/invest a ton of money you can’t “live your life.”  Most people making a decent salary in their 20s (post any debt paydown) can easily do both.  If you can’t, you’re probably overspending in some key area.  Either a car that’s stupidly expensive, too many clothes/watches/whatever, or too many randomly expensive meals/takeout.  None of that is really “living your life.”  I drive a 15 year old car, buy only a few nice things, cook when I can, invest at least 500-1k per month, and I can still go travel and/or out for a $200 dinner plenty of times a year.

There are websites with trackers of what they buy and sell. Its delayed, not sure by how much, but you can see when they make their purchases. Not sure of the name but can't be hard to find.
You either don’t have kids (fine) or don’t believe in climate change (makes you really retarded). I’m just saying that you can still make a fuck tonne of money without buying bullshit that fucks us all.

How did you get the impression that I'm focused on money and not living life? I DJ and produce music, I'm taking sailing course, I do pottery, I travel a ton, I gamble in Vegas, I gamble at my brokerage. Doesn't mean I can't have a retirement fund??

It has nothing to with the quality of the service... My question is why is the government involved in this service. Regulating and maintaining standards for delivery I understand but why actually provide the service? If you have a good answer why the delivery service portion of their job is needed..

It will pass at 2:30pm ET tomorrow after the epic tanking.        
       
Then, we'll moon tomorrow AM.     
      
Then, Trump will veto it, and we'll crater again by noon.    
      
Then, McConnell will say that they have the votes to override, and we'll moon again.     
     
Then, they'll fail to override, and everything tanks again.

My name is Yoshikage Kira. I'm 33 years old. My house is in the northeast section of Morioh, where all the villas are, and I am not married. I work as an employee for the Kame Yu department stores, and I get home every day by 8 PM at the latest. I don't smoke, but I occasionally drink. I'm in bed by 11 PM, and make sure I get eight hours of sleep, no matter what. After having a glass of warm milk and doing about twenty minutes of stretches before going to bed, I usually have no problems sleeping until morning. Just like a baby, I wake up without any fatigue or stress in the morning. I was told there were no issues at my last check-up. I'm trying to explain that I'm a person who wishes to live a very quiet life. I take care not to trouble myself with any enemies, like winning and losing, that would cause me to lose sleep at night. That is how I deal with society, and I know that is what brings me happiness. Although, if I were to fight I wouldn't lose to anyone.

On the one hand, I'm jealous of Cathie Wood and ARK Invest (and their followers) for being one of the OG Tesla bulls and killing it in 2020 with the ARK funds.

On the other hand, her Tesla call and ARK's year of hot performance in 2020 has drawn pretty much universal worship of her and ARK everywhere I look.  Like, kool-aid drinking worship levels.  When everyone leans to one side of the boat, I wonder if it might tip over.

What do you guys think of Cathie Wood going forward?  

Is she an oracle? Will Tesla and her ARK funds continue to perform as its underlying companies grow into their lofty expectations and valuations?

Or is she just a one-year wonder?  Will she soon to be a victim of her own success as a correction and cooling-off period hits speculative future-tech growth stocks (a boom followed by a long period of stagnation, similar to the tech stocks of 1999/2000)?
You bought that for her boyfriend to give to her?
This guy prob thinks he posted in r/roastme

I just don’t like when people try to pump positions that are about to get destroyed. I’ve seen IPOB posted about 20 different times in the same format, almost as if it were written by the same person. Smells like psychological manipulation(similar to how commercials work and based on how many people buy into meme stocks I’m guessing it works), and I wanted to give people the other side.
Except ARKG and other funds without Tesla that she manages are all doing well
Implying she didn’t also go big on CRSPR AND SQ.

I've started making my own ramen. I bought some seaweed a year ago and miso six months ago and noodles two weeks ago and I finally do it myself. It is SO good! I measure out the water, put some seaweed in, get it boiling, add some red pepper flakes and sesame seeds, add the noodles, wait a minute, add some bok choi and pre cooked tofu, wait two minutes, then pour it into the bowl with some mushrooms, sprouts, greens, wait a minute and add some miso. 

So good! And takes about 5 minutes start to finish with almost no cleanup.

I'm adding CBBT bigly this week, a huge acquisition taking place there. I swung RDGL for  200% and it's fallen back, awaiting FDA approval for cancer treatment and it looks like the price stabilized around .1 after the falloff so I'll be getting back in there this week. I'm super long TSNP (by far my biggest OTC holding), SFOR (should be announcing contracts for their super-secure Zoom like video chat this week which after the SWI nonsense I imagine will print), CBDD (more profit a quarter than WKHS has revenue a year and growing insanely fast), I also have a sizable position in BLDV, I am up big there and really should be swing trading that but like the company too much to forfeit my shares. Here's the PR on that: [https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-12-14/mjlb-highlights-existing-integrations-with-electric-vehicles-ev-and-positions-for-greater-penetration-into-this-280-billion](https://www.bloomberg.com/press-releases/2020-12-14/mjlb-highlights-existing-integrations-with-electric-vehicles-ev-and-positions-for-greater-penetration-into-this-280-billion)

**[Nifty Fifty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nifty Fifty)**

In the United States, the term Nifty Fifty was an informal designation for fifty popular large-cap stocks on the New York Stock Exchange in the 1960s and 1970s that were widely regarded as solid buy and hold growth stocks, or "Blue-chip" stocks. These fifty stocks are credited by historians with propelling the bull market of the early 1970s, while their subsequent crash and underperformance through the early 1980s are an example of what may occur following a period during which many investors, influenced by a positive market sentiment, ignore fundamental stock valuation metrics. Most have since recovered and are solid performers, although a few are now defunct or otherwise worthless.

Time also though. Shitty ramen takes infinitely shorter time than ribs and podadoes
Companies sell other companies stuff, who then turn around and sell that SAME thing, not an improved version of that thing, for a steep profit, all because consumers are willing to pay that price. Is that not wrong?? In my eyes it is. Yes a lot of time it comes with added value, but a lot of time it also comes with zero added value. Then they advertise the garbage products to make it seem like gold and have stupid consumers buy it because they trick them into thinking they need it. When it comes to products like hand sanitizers and toilet paper and Lysol etc. during a pandemic. Stuff that is inherently valuable, that is in short supply due to said extenuating circumstances, THAT is when it crosses an ethical line for me and I will have no part in it. But to me, that doesn’t equate to a consumer buying a new tech toy that is sold out instantly, for a stupid amount of money over MRSP. If they do that, they don’t value money, and just like you said, that’s their decision to make, how much is a PS5 worth to an individual? The goal of ANY vendor is to get the MOST for a product, compared to what THEY paid for it. Everyone wants the new PS5 right? Not  everyone pays more than MSRP. If someone is willing to pay that price, that shows you the price they are okay with receiving it for. It doesn’t mean I’m some diabolical evil person. If someone buys something  that is completely unnecessary whatsoever with probably my tax money that they are misappropriating, just like the government is with ALL our money, then that person did that to themselves. If no one paid inflated prices for things then guess what, no vendors could sell them, and eventually they’d be forced to come down in price to meet the proper price. I had a friend who got fired and I offered him a  $21 an hour job with me, he refused and said he couldn’t collect unemployment then. He then spent 3k on a PC build when he already had a very very nice computer set up. And that is a a rampant issue, they are handing out money and people are exploiting it, and exploiting taxpayers. They are evil, the system is evil. I, I am not evil, I can assure you of that. I’m sorry I play their game in hopes of making a small profit, but I am not the problem. The problem is bigger than I. And I am actually a very religious and ethical person, but I have no issues with sitting outside for hours to try and get a PS5 and then selling it for $50 profit to someone willing to pay that price, when they could’ve done the same thing as me and have a chance at getting one also.....

People skills will get you a long way. If you want to jump to pure sales look for a sales engineering gig as the stop gap.  You have the technical skills (assuming you know what you’re doing), so now you need to learn the sales side.  Do that for a bit and then move over to pure sales of you want.  Can make a killing.  Cloud sales may be a good spot.  GCP, AWS, MSFT all hire folks from the dev side.

>The short answer: No. In the somewhat longer words of the IRS: “No, the payment is not income and taxpayers will not owe tax on it. The payment will not reduce a taxpayer's refund or increase the amount they owe when they file their 2020 tax return next year. A payment also will not affect income for purposes of determining eligibility for federal government assistance or benefit programs."

I've made money on PFE before.  You have to buy the many months out.
Can confirm. live outside of shithole Memphis and through Germantown and Collierville these things are everywhere. Even seen a model S at pickwick state park this weekend. If I'm seeing so many in the Duramax, powerstroke, cummins capital of the world then they're doin alright

You just close the spread and buy a new one later? What am I missing?

No reason to sell mate - take out margin at a low interest rate and let those shares keep working
There is going to be such a hard justice boner I think.
Stimulus news or something else going on with them?
This was in November and steel prices have only gone up. You just clicked the first link from googling steel prices. That’s some real retard DD.

You can live in fear if you like but I’ll listen to the experts.
If you rotate that chart 90° counterclockwise, the trace looks like a rocket launch straight off of a North Korean launchpad.  And we all know that North Korean rockets go straight to the MOON!!!  I’m ALL IN!!!
Aren’t they coming out with some follow up to the series? I swear I heard that

It looks bad over 6 months but crank it to all and its not that significant. Granted I agree there will be a price to pay for all this stimulus and the ultra low rates but I dont think we are paying it yet.

It concerns me that the leading team of analysts in the world dedicated solely to managing a fund in this specific sector has chosen not to include SGMO in their portfolio. For that reason, I'm out.
You son of a bitch, I’m in.
So I'm guessing the poor bastards have to pay taxes on the stimmy?
ugly hands
All of this back and forth and drama for a measly $600? America is a sad place
If you’re here and complaining about $600 then you need to think about why you haven’t done the right things to make $ for yourself 

There have been so many opportunities to flip $100 into $1000 in the past 8 weeks

Reflect on your life and decision making, and maybe start by not coming on here just to complain and sound like a pussy 👍

This is correct (except Smartpost is Fedex). Both Fedex and UPS have services that utilize USPS for last mile delivery, but the shipper selects that service when shipping, it’s not as if Fedex says we have too many packages, let’s give half to USPS.

Everyone is pricing in back to normal by summer. If these new strains turn out to be something, well...
The market doesn’t always align purely with science. I have heard this time and time again, doesn’t mean there isn’t money to be made with $SGMO. 

I’ve held NTLA, CRSP, EDIT for years now. Trend following for options is the way. Right now, the trend looks good.

For sure. First couple of seasons were pretty solid.
Oil is dying. RIG has been through severe financial trouble. RIG doesn't hold value well (hence it's trading it freaking weeklies) no matter what it's IV is and very simply has very little realistic long-term value. It is trading as an "undervalued" company however it also doesn't have much value inherent to it and the oil escapades that plagued the larger corporations ravaged the already not very efficient RIG far worse. 

As oil recovers RIG won't be a major player much like how it was not in the past.

No one was expecting $1,200. They’ve been saying $600 for months now, which I agree is way too low.
I don't think any court would actually demand that.
Well good for him. He will be soon pleas something else
reason why [investing.com](https://investing.com) has diff numbers than cnbc/yahoo is that investing took into account the after hours action on friday which was red.
Stimmy passed perfect timing for everyone to spend the $ Christmas shopping. Straight injection of $ to the market and you guys are still bearish this week? Maybe this isn’t for you
What r we buyin with this $600 bois
As a Brit. I will say that yes, its pretty pretty bad.

In some areas at the start of the week it accounted for 15% of new cases, and then by Friday that had gone up to 66%

Oh so slaves were tricked into it? You’re broadening your definition to support a poor argument that I’m not sure you even agree with completely. I mean I doubt you’d buy into a company that sold women as sex slaves just because it would make you a lot of money. That’s really what I meant. We do care a little. We have lines we won’t cross, I’m sure.

Any stock can be a pump and dump when we’re are talking about buying weekly calls is what I’m saying. Just because you think PLTR is a good play long term doesn’t mean this week is a good week to buy the 40c expiring Friday. I have a small position in BB and think it might be a good play. But last week going into earnings was a bad time to go in. When did the DD posts start rolling in? Oh right when it was a bad time to buy calls and a good time to sell them.

I see what you did wrong. You gotta play the market by selling high and buying low. It's a little tip I picked up at a 2 hour class I spent 10k on.
Im not going to try to speculate this short week we have coming up. I’m gonna decide on whether to enter a position monday, but Id go at least a month out and maybe up to 6 mos with any position. I dont think there will be some epic fall (esp now that they have a ton of cash on hand), but I do believe we’ll see the $300s within 6 months....I think their big announcements will become less extraordinary and potentially very disappointing with an intensely more competitive environment across all of their verticals. They haven’t captured enough market share (not talking about EV market, but auto market in general) to be ubiquitous, which is how amazon and apple got to where they are now. Solar, batteries, autonomous driving, etc are up for grabs, and a lot of people will have deep pockets to buy the best tech as we’ve been seeing with all these SPACs. Bottom line is that so much success is built in to the SP right now. Could it become the most valuable company in the world, sure, but it could also fail and/or have a ton of hiccups along the way. From a macro/politics standpoint you can already see the games republicans are going to play to try to hamstring Biden...they could easily sabotage the economy to start the blame game for the next round of elections- realistically this will probably take a year to play out in the economy at large. I was a gae bull early this year and eventually converted, but I’m very cautious going long anything right now and especially so with the high flyers. At the end of the day, I think it’s better than 50/50 for a 3-4x return, and that math makes sense to me.

None of these gig-economy companies will ever break even using the current model.   Even poorly paid U.S. workers are paid enough that you can't just tack a few bucks on an order and have enough to pay the driver, all of your in-house employees and operating costs, and still have some profit left over.  Even when restaurants offer the service themselves(no middleman), they're not making much from it.  It's mostly to get customers who they wouldn't reach otherwise.
That's all just conjecture, we aren't at the point where everyone has the ability and want, to go online-only.  If we were, there would be 0 demand for a disc version of the new consoles, yet they sold more than their disc-less counterparts.  

One thing we lag behind in is the internet capability, a lot of areas still on monthly bandwidth limits or slow speeds, or a combination of both which means people there can't feasibly go online-only.  

Another point is storage, both come with under 1TB in usable hard drive space, a game like COD will eat up 135gb + updates.. online-only people will have like 5 games before they have to delete one.. seems like a hassle.  Then if they want to play the game they deleted, they have to redownload it.. on their crappy internet speed.  Or, they can pop in their disc.

I have read them lol which is why I know you’re wrong. Like I said short to available float is subjective and including fully exercised options into it is being subjective. I never said you were wrong in that calculation... I was just drawing parallels in how the short to available float is SIMILAR in both situations if you were equally subjective. 

Institutional ownership is like 95% for GameStop. You can’t speak to the mind of these institutions as to whether they are holding for a squeeze or they’re holding as an actual retail play. Therefore short to available float is subjective. Just like you cannot speak to Porsche’s mindset if they actually ever planned on exercising those options. 

I just don’t see your logic in any of this.
Futures flat as all hell, y’all really work yourselves up

Last stimulus lifted everything. This time we also have vaccine approval for moderna and more distribution. Cases are going up but same as last time also. I expect a solid Green Day followed by a few red days. I think TSLA will be a good indicator for the size of the day and how green it will be. If it goes down a little bit then that’s okay. If it is green tomorrow SPY will rally ahead of it.

I only invest or place bets on things I’m interested in so I don’t have a position in Etsy. As far as being a savant, I just do things, no real strategy. I’m opposed to the idea of outcome based narratives and how that’s used to label someone as a genius/fool.

Free money is free money
20 dollar open
The $600 is actually $800.  
The stimulus package is so sucky that it will drag Tesla down to less than $600.  
You can then buy 1 share with that stimmy money and ride it to $800.

I agree. I do not think smart money is actually buying the money. It’s trading algorithms that are still running a bull market and retail keeps buying in. At some point the algorithm will trigger sell. To buy in atm violates what you learn when you do basic TA

No. Where’s the free flair
No capital gains tax break? Absolute shit deal
I do think steel is poised to take off but I don’t like MT.  US Steel’s recent acquisition of Big River gives them mini mills which will make them more consistently profitable, Cleveland Cliffs acquisition of Arcelor Mittal’s US operations makes them the biggest game in town now, and Nucor is building new mills all across the country.  I’d take any of those three over MT, especially since we’re due for an infrastructure bill, which will not directly benefit foreign mills.

The fact that you included the fully exercised  options in the VW short squeeze despite not considering the possibility of naked selling options (hence the mere existence of the word) and then say that “short to available float is not subjective” and then make a subjective statement to include fully exercised options makes me deeply concerned about your IQ.

>So yeah, if someone wants to buy a PS4 from me for an extra $50 bucks of MRSP, I think I can still manage to sleep at night. 

If you had the item beforehand, used it, and wanted to get rid of it, no one would call you an asshole for taking advantage of a price rise.

>Not to mention I have firsthand witnessed many cases of people throwing away their stimulus checks and unemployment checks on WANTS and not NEEDS. 

Not your money, not your decision. I've witnessed people buy stupid shit with it too. It isn't your money. Let them do with it what they want.

>Stuff that I wouldn’t even reward myself with when I had the money available and was working two jobs, it’s called valuing money. 

Again, your decision.

>If they are willing to pay more than MRSP for a PS4 that’s a them issue, it takes two parties. **There will always be resellers, on any product in any market.** 

Yes, there will always be resellers. What you are doing is taking advantage of an already limited supply and making it more limited all for making a quick buck.

>Half the companies in existence and their whole business model revolves around getting a product for cheaper than other people, and then selling it for more than it is worth, to people who are willing to pay that price for it. 

Usually they add value to it in some way, which you are not doing.

>Advertising is evil too, **Is buying the new iPhone evil because they make the phone for $300 and then sell it for 4x that?** 

Apple added value to the iPhone by assembling it, which the average consumer could not do. 

>The buyer and how bad they want to own something and how much is available dictates market price. 

No argument there.

>Most people don’t even want to get a job, even when they are readily available for anyone who wants one most of the time, because they’re making more off unemployment, and buy stuff I wouldn’t even treat myself on back when had two jobs. There are two kind of people in life.. life is not fair.

Sure, why not.

>If everyone refused to pay inflated amounts for stupid shit, they wouldn’t be able to sell it for said amounts...

No argument there. 

I agree with you in economic terms. Me calling you an asshole is that you reselling the shit is small-time market manipulation. Look at the people who bought and tried to resell shit in March. All the hand sanitizers, toilet paper, shit that people actually needed. Do people need a PS5? Fuck no. But the concept is the same. 

You do you, I just wanted to point out that you're a dick, in case you've never been told that before. What you choose to do with that info is up to you.
Tomorrow will be a good day.
Goodnight guys, hope mt is up tomorrow
Except for one tiny mistake. Tax loss selling happens at the end of the year, not at the beginning of the year. So, December end dump, January pump.

Investing.com uses AH close prices. All the indices shot up around .4% AH so everything looked down much more then what it is was. Normally around 7pm they flip to the real close price at 4pm the previous trading day.

It was a big shares position. Still have some calls.
What does that mean in practical terms?
PIC🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀
It's tempting rn
NIO 53$ at open.
Agreed, been in since $11.50, rode the pump up and down. Don’t want to try predict a sure thing, but pretty confident it can run up quickly. I was in Tesla at $300, and thought nio would create fomo for people looking to the next Tesla, and bought that at $10. Also Bought QS at $14, and thinking people will be doing the same this time on wanting the next QS. The only mistake I did is I sold all those positions way too early, so gonna 💎 hand this one.
It was a big shares position. Still have some calls.
Lol. Future green now? Bear parade was short lived.

Early investors foisted their worthless shares onto retards during this historically bullish market. Smart exit for them, but they also have to pedal that nonsense to keep the stock price up until lockout periods end at 90 and 180 days per S1.

Whoa
why do u hate blink so much lol. who cares
I did the same thing.
So anyone else think we will dump in the beginning of January? Reasons:

1. People will sell to book profits from this inflated market and to avoid paying taxes for a whole year.
2. Beginning of the year and people aren’t usually in a great mood as the holidays are over - so they will take such decisions.

TransferWise and Revolut are the biggest unicorns for retail FX exchange. 

Only idiots use Western Union and shit like that.
It's easier to do it with art.  It's one of the main reasons for the elite art scene.  Mostly because it's price is entirely subjective, so you can make up any bullshit number.  Furthermore, the way the laws are set up, you can store the art in an tax-haven warehouse on one of the islands outside the U.S.  You only have to pay taxes on it, when you bring it back into the U.S.  So these "art collectors" buy the art from another collector who is currently storing this multi-million dollar piece in said warehouse, and they just transfer it over to their name but not move it from the warehouse. High end art often only literally moves feet after it's been purchased, from one billionaire's designated shelf in a communal warehouse, to another's.

I'm probably never going to use it, but let's be honest America and the rest of the world are not going to stop watching porn any time soon. And despite plenty of free porn options, OnlyFans content producers have made insane amounts of money. I think that if OnlyFans plays this right then they have a lot of opportunity for growth. Like for example imagine a $5/month subscription service that gives you access to a certain subset of videos from a variety of content creators instead of subscribing on a creator-specific basis. And they could go further on that idea with higher-tier subscriptions of that nature.

By too many things I mean;

* New virus strains + stricter lockdown
* Apple shutting down locations isn't exactly a vote of confidence
* SPY and almost every index is at an ATH

Let me just start off by saying, that sure is a lot of words. 

Here’s why you’re wrong with your thesis. 

Deepwater rigs are extremely expensive to operate. 

With all ancillary costs even in a downturn market like now the burn rate of these operations near 1Million a day. 

Yes you heard that right, 1 with 6 motherfuckin zeros behind it. 

Most of if not all of the deepwater operations going on right now were brokered back when oil prices were more attractive or drilling rights were far more attractive and it’s just cheaper to bite the bullet now and continue these operations. 

But we’re a long long ways from oil prices being attractive enough for Transocean to capitalize off of expansion. 

Oil companies are focused on land work where even an elaborate setup will be in the $50-60k per day burn rate. 

Yup you read that right, almost 1/20th the cost of a deepwater operation. 

Deepwater offshore programs will continue due to budgets already having them priced in, contractual obligations and lease deadlines but don’t expect an explosion of deepwater action for a while. Generally 9-18months after oil gets let’s say at least $80/bbl or higher. 

Then you might see some guys dipping their toes in the deepwater. 

There are other oilmen here I’m sure if they’ve been in it long enough they’ll agree.
That’s a generous thought that all of WSB has $1000
''''**This is really red** ***OMFUCKINGCHRIST It iS rEAlLy FUCKING RED***''''- lmfao you fucking clowns.

If no one is around, does a 🐻  really eat his shit in the woods?
When inflation goes sky high and we get to a point where limited resources are dried up and gone, yeah, then it'll be the fall of capitalism. Even in communist countries people barter with each other for shit... That doesn't make them a capitalist country. Eventually through automation and destruction of resources and wealth inequality and inflation, a central government will have to essentially provide UBI for it's citizens lest everyone but a select few ends up dying

“He bounces between this delight in having a future life together and this fatalism about how it will never work,” Smythe says. “It’s definitely in the latter category now.” Sitting in her basement apartment, her eyes wet, her voice quavering, she says she will continue to wait for him while he serves the remaining years of his sentence: “I’m gonna try,” she says. “I’ll be here.”

For the retards that do not understand how investing.com futures work:  
  
The futures from 6:00 PM to 7:10 PM EST factor in after-market.  
  
The futures from 7:10 PM EST onwards reflect deltas from market close from the previous trading session.

Who knows what the market's been pricing in. But the fact that market hit new ATH last week, could suggest it was pricing in stimmy as likely lol
I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again, join a phone bank or some bs and help dems win the senate in GA. It’s the only clear way to big tendies in 2021 because a split Congress is just going to get us more of this weak stimmy crap

You just ask. The answer might be no. If the answer is no, they'll expect you to start looking for a new job, which, obviously, you should do if they say no. After you find a new job, if you prefer to stay where you are, but are willing to leave, take your competing offer to your manager and let them know what salary you'd require in order to stay. If they say no again, they don't value you at the price that market has determined you're worth, so say goodbye.

For all those salivating over shorting **DASH** or buying puts on it that are far dated, don't do it....yet.  
  
I too thought the same about SNOW when it was at $300 and got squeezed al the way to $425. I eventually made it back by puts bought north of $400 because of the lockup expiry last Monday.  
  
DASH is a POS stock and deserves to be way lower than $100. But the chances are good you might get squeezed out in the next few months because this market is irrational.  
  
TSLA, SNOW and ZM should be a cautionary tale.  
  
**TSLA** $1000 pre-split = Hurr durr overvalued. Proceeds to go to $3500  
**SNOW** $240 IPO open = Hurr durr overvalued. Proceeds to go to $425  
**ZM** $150 = Hurr durr overvalued. Proceeds to go to $600  
  
**DON'T BUY PUTS until lockup expirations. No way will the fucktards at JPM and Morgan Stanley dump their positions at your strike price**

Eh I don't trust futures especially with smaller indexes having to include tesla.  Anyone know of anyone who's analyzed that last 20-30 minutes in trading on Friday?  That shit was wiiiiild
On the one hand markets could be spooked by the new Virus strain. On the other hand the smart strategists know that the vaccine will deal with it. Sure prices may drop tomorrow - that means you should buy stable shares at low prices. Come March you’ll be laughing.
Anyone else getting the March vibes right now. I really thought the Conservatives would buckle and allow at the very least a $1 trillion stimulus, but now idk wtf bullish sentiment there is to drive up the market. Might liquidate my index investments if we are green from the stimulus news in the morning tbh.
Dow futures slightly down. 
Can’t let the bears win tomorrow.

They are gonna pass the $900 billion stimulus and say that another $900 billion stimulus is in the works. Then both sides would have daily discussions for the next few months for the "New Stimulus" while we keep breaking all time highs and reach the magical figure of SPY 420  
  
*Splitting the stimulus into two prolongs the "stimulus talks". Might actually work in our favor to keep pumping the markets with all this edging*

Obviously a bigly sector rotation back to tech about to occur. Hope you didn’t hold CCL calls over the weekend.
This here is a life lesson, thank you 👍
I’ve been reading on here that MSFT will have a very positive next few weeks (take that with a grain of salt). TBH, I would personally take my $$ out of MSFT as it can be spent better in other growth stocks. Or perhaps you can self half your shares and move them somewhere else just in case MSFT does go on a run.
You idiot, it will update the numbers, with Friday’s close at 7:10EST like it does every day
Why not just sell CSP on PLTR? I stopped doing CC on that because it would randomly moon.
The best tool you have to not be poor is to make more money.
I don't even need to look at other sites to probably know that what's happening is some sites are marking to 4:00 on Friday, and some to 4:15 on Friday (there was a large move in between). The meaningful number is the actual numerical value of the futures. See if that's equal. Don't look at the % change. Then remark to the SPY 4:00 close.
The move was Friday fam.

I don't think people realise the way this new covid strain is going to spook the markets.

The scary thing is that, we cannot say for certainty that the vaccine now works on this thing or if the vaccine will work on the next mutation we come across.

Its a massive blow to think the one thing we have been pinning our hopes on for the last 10 months may not be as effective as first thought. That maybe we are not actually out of the woods yet.

It is relative.  They have been off from each other for days not just friday.
God damn!! I just bought on hype.. you sure they gonna print us some money??
Thats what the question is, if its not, good god talk about uncertainty, zm calls looking real nice right now
Lots of nervous bed shitting bulls in here tonight. You know what that means
🦅🦅🦅
Lost $40k on FDX calls last week, YOLO still holding with these diamond hands
Yeah I can see it happening.

Vaccines protect against the new strain
A correction is inevitable, just keep some extra $ on hand this week for buying the dip
I learned everything I know from Yahoo finance comment boards. Buy calls tomorrow, boys.
Long calls on ROPE
Nope, there was priced in a stimulus of 1.8T and we got 900b so it is because of stimmy
Technically maybe a buy but what about the extra shared to be released?

There will be resistance... But it will all be manipulation and frantic buying by the company execs or early shareholders I bet. They won't be able to hold it for long and will eventually all sell off once it peaks

No.
There's a new strain of the corona virus. Europe is shutting down. Apparently we all have to revert to the stone age so grandma can live an extra week.
I think the virus invested in PLTR and is doing insider trading at its finest
 Correct.  

Just track what the lawmaker/scum class do with their trades and ignore the news for making tendies
So... fox news. Got it.
Yeah that's what I did for 150k in calls for 12/24. That's why I'm waiting for it to pop and im getting the fuck out of this market w full dry powder or going straight 🌈🐻
Priced in

Hope for more stimulus
Yeah it's not as bad.. plus it's more susceptible to vaccines. It's great news.
Red at night, bulls delight.

I mean,  bears always win on Sunday,  but then cry on days,  when it really matters
What about her bf did he agree too?
Wow god speed. I dont think it sees that level again.
I own shares and im more in for what the platform means for other drugs/treatments. The vax is just proof of concept. NIH has been big on MRNA for years
For the last month it seems like every day that has opened green finished red and vice versa.

no..we're not fucked. those over the age of 80 with 2.6 co morbidites and basically 1 foot in the grave are fucked.
Doing the same on NIO and PLTR. Thinking of doubling down on PLTR to 2k shares.

Do you reinvest your premiums in to more shares? Or just stay in cash?

Not a virologist, but based on what I’ve read thus far, mostly true. Think of it as a matter of survival for the entity. This mutation still hasn’t had enough study to determine this for sure, so as of now it’s up in the air.

I've become bearish now. The markets can't pump on "stimulus hopes" anymore.

Pump and dump by that shady cult group, sorry you got to hold the bags bruh.... For your sake, I hope it goes up and you come out unscathed.
ok noob
it’s because how you said breaking and it was all in bold even though it is not really breaking, hence my calling you cnn, because you appear to have replicated their mo of calling news that isn’t breaking, well, breaking, I’m sorry I keep forgetting everyone here is a fellow autist who needs the minutia and nuances to be explained in detail
PLTR or SNOW or BFT?
That's how it works though: when you doubt the most, buy the most. Unless you've been hiv positive and in that case good luck.

Well it seems like this thread is hidden from the wsb page. Maybe bankers paying wsb mods
If we're red its nothing to do with stimilus, it's the virus mutating and Europe shutting down that does it, uncertainty may have finally caught up , that being said nothing's confirmed and zm calls looking tasty

Oh one small update:

Freedom caucus has been pitching a fit all weekend about not having the text of either bill.  They've made it publicly known that they do not support a CR and want POTUS to veto any omnibus bill that might get passed. Unsure if it'll happen but they're not happy that congress will not get a chance to review the bill before it's pushed for a vote.

Are you more retarded than I? Supply and demand bud, no feelings. If a consumer is willing to pay an inflated price for a product I have and it switches hands, that’s a voluntary beneficial to both transaction, clearly they were okay enough with it to still want it because they still bought it.... Don’t get price gouged for a fucking electronic accessory. If you have the luxury to pay $600 for a PS5 instead of waiting and getting your hands on one yourself for retail price, YOU are what is wrong with the world , and a lazy fuck who doesn’t value money. No regrets.

Everyone needs to read this.

https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2020/11/30/how-venture-capitalists-are-deforming-capitalism

Essentially, the gameplan for big VCs these days is to dump money into projects until they can outlast the competition and have a monopoly. You can interpret this in one of two ways:

1. After it becomes a monopoly surely it will be profitable and therefore could be a good investment now if you see monopoly being relatively soon.

2. Fundamentals and a good product *no longer fucking matter even a little bit* to VCs and that they will prop up any shit business they think they can win on a few years down the road. 

Then you gotta ask yourself if you're willing to bet against these guys knowing that even if you're right and it's a shit company they can't be bled dry.
Don’t bet against the USA!!!!
Why? Futures red
It's already basically done deal and there was some new vaccine news so it's good as green. If not then yeah the inevitable collapse is here. Either way cool w me.

These memes are posted ironically so expect a bloody Monday. Christmas is canceled, rapidly mutating COVID variants spreading, more lockdowns, government shutdown is likely and the annual pre tax season sell-offs.
TSLA really needs to pull back a little. The higher it moons, the harder it's going to crash and that's not good for SPY. At the very least, it needs to go sideways for a couple of months.

Ok but that’s two separate things. Yes market makers raise share price by hedging to protect their investment but the increasing share price is a side effect of them hedging. Options alone do not move share prices.

Keep telling yourself that.
Huge GREEN indicators guys!
Don't worry f.am, futes will be solid green once giants win - it's how it works. They lost last week so the week was lackluster. Better hope they win tonight. 

I spent another 3k on 12/24 calls but my genius friend put 6k on the giants. I hope we finish the week up the same.
Same here, hoping Monday is gonna be good with the stimulus talks
Because they’ve lied about this for six months ? 9 months? No one believes them
New vaccine. Stimmy passed. Jets are beating the rams. All signs point to $JETS $JETS $JETS
yeah, you can also use future pricing for market sentiment. 

Look at the future months prices to see how the market is pricing the future, its not 100% but you can use it to gauge sentiment.
Popeyes is superior.
Isn't the vote tomorrow morning? If it passes get ready for a giant red to green

Lol. To the moon.
Don’t forget, those $600 aren’t a gift. They are your money you paid taxes with. And while you want that money for that PS5, Nancy and Mitch already got the tips from their CEO buddies to buy and sell options, which of course is illegal for you and me.
Eagles are green. Cardinals are red. Game is tied. Whoever wins is what the market will do tomorrow

No Sir. I simply invest in shit processing corporations. Rich or Poor, Gay or Straight, Bull or Bear, we all gotta shit.
For once most of my shit doesn’t expire for over a month but I’m still nervous as fuck. Might just not open my phone

I’ve seen this before, GREEN BY OPEN
Do we get extra if we sustained substantial losses in the markets that year? Just hypothetically
Nah we're not. Things are looking good. Stimulus + vaccines is great combo.
Idk man, I've ONLY used Uber eats and I order every week. Same with all my coworkers. (That and bite squad which is a local company) 
I do have one coworker that did drive for doordash, and they said it completely sucked

That's a fire hazard.

Question for you, how well would a burnt out mid/mid-senior software engineer with decent people skills do in tech sales?
900b is a joke compared to the original 3T deal
FDs on sight, and I’ll glow
i may be retarded but im making bank 🏦🏦🏦
Whatever. The more money the better
Its because the stimulus amount is shit
If you're taking shrooms for "self-reflection will help you address the root causes for your addictions and can be dealt with accordingly thanks to the natural wisdom and insight that arises" then anything less than 5g won't cut it.
Satan’s schlong must be a very light shade of red, because S&P is down 0.1% and Nasdaq is green...

It’s clear you don’t understand options. If Tesla even dropped 5% on Monday this contract would increase by more than 10% in value. It’s lower risk loss if Tesla goes up,yet less gains if Tesla does drop than a 500p
yea its a nice lotto. MRNA will crash<50 if their shit vaccine they made in 3 months has issues with new strain

Ya because that never happens
they decided not to vote on it today and wait until tomorrow for some reason

I mean, I seen this coming since last week, don’t know why people think stimulus hasn’t been priced in at this point

Update:

Bill is positive news but leaders on both sides are essentially posturing right now.  CR bill just introduced because 90% of congress is just now looking at the bill.  There's still plenty of opportunity for a Toomey style wrench to be thrown back into the equation but not likely.  

Looks like my buddy was right last week when he said no chance of a deal by Friday but 99% by sunday.  Good luck to all.  Fun past couple of days, stay safe y'all!

how about a synthetic. sell a call and buy a put.

Dear CEO,

Thank you,
I’m sure they can close as fast as buying with cash, which allow them to flip. I wonder how fast they can find a buyer though. If their cash is locked up for a long time, their business will be very constrained by the amount of cash they raise.

Oh shit I don't even know what to say that's awful and I would have prolly barfed
Nobody is locking red states down.
Praying my I can sell my TSLA and ROKU calls tomorrow AM on this stim news and go back to being 🌈🐻 safely.
My ass still hurts from the last time I bought puts, ain’t happening again. Being a 🌈🌈🐻🐻 is the dumbest financial choice you can make
And of the 900 billion, only about 15% is for the direct $600 payments. The bulk goes to "small" multi million dollar businesses

No other investments? 100% PLTR?
i thought spreads would be easy money. it's not.
i guarantee that there will be no stimmy. congress is full of fuckheads who cant get anything done. so long as they stall, they can continue to fund themselves and fill their pockets with our lost tendies
Reading thorough DD like this makes me happy and I really appreciate it.

TSLA is now a part of the sp500, which means it'll take TSLA down kicking and screaming in the future. get fukt TSLA bulls.
🚀🚀🚀
Or because it is the only positive thing that has been talked about all year, and now its over with nothing to replace it with, while Europe shuts down?
its a long term really good play imo, gl
That's actually not a bad trade. Most likely you won't win but if you do as long as the payoff is high enough it's worth it. 99% chance loses 100 bucks for 1% chance to win 11k is a positive bet actually.
I haven’t even gotten the first 1200

[deleted]
I love reading DD after I've already bought into a stock. Almost makes me feel like I made a smart play and I'm not just a blind sheep following the herd
So let me get this straight. Congress spent several months arguing over whether the stimulus should be $1.8 trillion or $2.2 trillion and they ended up agreeing on a $900 billion bill? Those pieces of garbage don’t give a shit about the people. They just do whatever can get them more power and money.
Tomorrow is going to go down in history as another day.
haha

I mean but the taxes though
Yeah it costs more then $600 to call a fire truck to put out a fire :p
Seriously. Jesus’ birthday week and stimmy 2.0. What happened to when people used to have sack around here?
1 share of pltr and a pack of smokes.
Correction, fiancé
Idk I’m buying 10 copies of cyberpunk for PS4. Resale on those can only go up
sell puts to acquire the shares, then do covered calls. Repeat if calls are exercised.
So is stimulus confirmed? $600 only? Based on 2019 tax filing?
Then when the check shows up you've just got an extra 600 for another yolo!
No 🧢
Robert it goes down
April 30th will be the nail in the coffin for NKLA. Expect a fire sale.
Oh yeah I misread
Imagine getting the $600 as an AMZN store credit or as 1 TSLA share
I think the red is mostly because an official

The split made TSLA pump even more retard
Was being sarcastic
It feels like an act of folly trying to export a national debt through currency devaluation, especially in an era of advancing domestic production capabilities and stagnant transport advances, the US's comparative advantage decays to worthless in this environment. You're going to be bag-holding a lot of export goods, does inventory count towards gdp?
1-3am eastern is when the action starts
The bigger news isn’t the $600 checks going out to everyone.  It’s the fact that nearly 12 million people will not go homeless in a few days when the eviction moratorium was ending.
fuck FUCK FUKC FUCKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKKK!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Multiple governments, Microsoft, Fortune 500 companies, etc. all used this software and the malicious update went unnoticed until they found it. Nobody is shitting on these other companies which dropped the ball worse. The only one to blame here is solarwinds123

Thanks Dr. Shuffle
Her boyfriend is going to pawn it and put it on tsla calls.
Spy went up about a $1 in AH. So investing.com is showing it way worse then it really is. Using the close price of the indices, futures are pretty flat right now.
Just let it be for now.. Lots of people got screwed the first time around trying to short it because of the high IV.
I’m just here to watch people freak out about a <0.5% change in futures.
It’s 180 billion, and even if it was 1.8 billion, that would be 99.82% of 1 trillion going to special interests not 88%. 

Most people this bad at math are self aware and don’t go around throwing out numbers.

The $600 is intended to be yolod on spy calls so that its actually worth an appropriate amount of stimulus

I think they’re happy bc it’s not up on stimulus news. You would think that would drive up futures.
I am not too bullish either, cuz I think the worst is yet to come for the finance sector. But I want to see if it catches some steam, off of this catalyst.
Wish I didn’t panic sell my SPY puts during that run up EOD Friday 🤡 That was some bullshit.

They said they were gonna give the poor moh’ money.  Poor people will be forced deeper into debt.  Fortunately all borrowing restrictions have been lifted so the banks don’t have to keep any money on hand at all while being able to lend out and collect money on infinite money.  ++protections from anyone defaulting == infinite pump as fast as they can lend.  Too much money would mean less borrowing.  +other shit = bank pump.

Also they directly name various green energy tech companies which should pump big tech.  Combined with the tech acceleration we’ve been building up to since “the pandemic accelerated tech adoption by 10 years” we should see values spike up towards that true value at every fake promise of a *return to normal*.  Tech pump.

Could give a reason for every sector to pump due to increased consumption from the stimulus.  It is a bearish fallacy to think that we can’t pump for it being less money than expected.  Especially since most of it is reimbursement for corporations that they are sending to the fed to multiply for them 20:1 just like before with forgivable loans that have the tiniest of strings attached.  Aka. actually several trillion still in pump moan~áy just not for normal people.

Stupid bear.  There are bigger reasons too just there are so many reasons for SPY $420 EoY

That's a very short window with any women. Can confirm. Am married.
Holy shit, 0.3% down in early futures trading. Shit shit shot this must be the end of the bull run. It’s all over because of this.
Hopefully they had a last will
I'm seeing green where do you see -0.3%?
Oh yea. And it's relationship to time. Money is the time saver. I can do all of the things you're talking about rn but me and my wife avg about 60 hrs a week to do it so what is the point? I need financial freedom to slow down time.

Its just delayed vs investing.com brother
Based
Etsy has world changing potential, which Tesla does not.
But for real, I expect Tesla to go up as well, but I’m kind of a contrarian.
Honestly, I agree with you. 'DoorDash' is all the craze right now, but this is no Panetir.

The ask is absurd. HOWEVER, keep in mind this is a Y Combinator darling... so there are many big fish with interests in promoting the stock value.

This is a wrong approach, however. Often, with a co like this, once they 'lose value' it can be an unstoppable avalanche of bad press.

Slack was a good co, but somehow lost value early, and stayed *way* under valued, up to the day they got acquired. That's the penalty for pissing off your early investors. It's more than just a stock game, it's like Cyberpunk pre-orders or something. Once the most loyal abandon you, it's difficult to get a new wife.
last stimmy was what 1.8T? So this one is about half of the last one. Last one gave us 5 months on retarded bull market. May this one last at least 3 months Amen
Yeah

I dunno. Haven't read the SEC filings but haven't heard of dilution at ticker change. Usually ticker changes don't come with dilution. Dilution comes with PIPE and legacy shares unlocks for SPACs.
🤡🤡🤡
I am anyway yes. Just not this week and next.
I'm not DVing you who cares about internet points lmao, but I was confused by your comment.. you were talking about amazon and said "see them fail", so assume you meant amazon.. but it seems like you were talking about GME.  Anyways, you do you brotha.  Not sure how they "milk the retail customer" when they sell at MSRP and include exclusives for preordering, but ok

And also, every business is a for-profit business, ie for greed.. not exclusive to Amazon or GME

I don't have to think back, I sold my PS4 for like 130 when I bought it for like 150.. so again, not milking by any means but ok

Ahh,
Okay quick rundown. Just like option futures have an expiration date.

You have the front month and next month contract, when people say spot price it usally refers to the front month contract. 

some platform will automatically link /NQ to its front month contract. 


the months for the E-minis are 
HMUZ

I think H is the current month ( march ) and M is the next contract over i think june 


March	H


June	M


September	U


December	Z
Nobody buying but everybody holding
I was feeling bad because I didn’t hold over the weekend , especially when stimmy passed & everyone here was celebrating . Think I’ll sit tomorrow out now , idk wtf is happening

Yesssirrrr!!! It will eventually fly trust
Yea it is dead again
Retard bears are delusional its 630 lmao
After months we got the stimulus passed and the futures celebrates it with some limp dick action
Definitely sell the news like we have been doing
Why not? Tell him to get in shape and work like everyone else or quit whining.
All the indexes shot up after 4pm in the after hours. Investing.com uses that price as a start so it went down from that point. But, the market uses the close at 4pm to determine if a stock goes up and from that point it is up.
I think I’ll actually buy some airlines and a few others. Part of me thinks the MM will pull some shit and since everyone will expect a green pump day, tomorrow will be red. I’m also retarded so I’m unsure.
I think there’s still some nervousness since stimulus hasn’t passed. Give it until midnight. Probably won’t be red still
[deleted]
Not long. Assuming it manifests, this week, early next. It’s technical not a real problem. Snatch up Tesla at $420.69 I think
And green again- no wait re-green..

People who say they “don’t care about money” are fucking idiots. I’m not saying that everyone needs to strive for a mansion or a Lamborghini. But the feeling of financial freedom is the best thing you can have. Not having to check you bank account before you go out to eat, buying whatever you want in the grocery store, not having to worry about paying for your kid’s education. This will relieve 100x the stress a stupid vacation or impulse purchase will get you. Everyone should care about money, to an extent

The stimulus will send us to the moon. Don’t be short into the new year. Buy the meme stocks those people will put their stim check into. In other words, set a limit order for Tesla at $420.69
I think this one is useless but the market will keep floating up as long as rates = 0 and there is future stimmy talks people will keep money in the market

You can be on disability for being overweight???
Going to be some lovely dips to buy this week hopefully. My hedges will hit max profit, STONKS BABY!

I have good news and bad news guys. 


1) good news. Your privileged enough to read this. 

2) bad news. You gonna be unprivileged and homeless. Futures turned red.
The game is definitely rigged against you. It's not enough to just invest in a good company, you have to be willing to invest in educating yourself on how to not get fucked for every good idea you come up with.
Peaking Dow
Tsla
Immediately loaning myself $600 to buy calls
Literally just got all my Christmas shopping done on Amazon, all will be here by Wednesday spent 1k...calls
Actual lottery tickets
London lockdown , new COVID strain ..
Every day I regret not getting in on PLTR and I saw it from early and was scared. You think we will see 33.50 again soon? I mean with such exposure you think it would be $40 already. I’m scared my entrance would initiate the move back down to $15, because I have such bad luck.
Long your kids college fund

Or a new corvette
Damn the GME posts have hit a new low. Sad.
Volatility 😍

Not according to my elite high tech futures sofware that can accurately predict everything that happens with 100% precision for 30 days out
Never buy a deprecating asset...

All kidding aside congrats man!

You can offset your gains with it but I’m
guessing no one here knows what those are.
You just lost half your tendies forever... Congradulation
Market bound for a correction
Just get her to have an affair with you. 

Side story though, some guy from salt lake where I live sued Taylor Swift and Ariana Grande because they wouldn't go out with him. He said they were discriminating against people with disabilities by not dating him.

Flush it overnight -3%.
Plenty of time to lose money on that
Man please explain, i have options but also a small business. This shits not a joke anymore for me, is it the british strain of corona or the stimmy??
This guys sounds smarter than me and I like it.
You sound like a bitch ass dickhead. Idk tho
BRrRRrrRrRrrrr
Wait whatttt
Yeah probably just gonna delete now "bUllS R fUK"
Futures looking weak after stimulus deal boys..I think we fixing to dip bigly next week.
Fucking nerd
So how long do you think this selling will last?
Jesus fucking Crust. 

This is the biggest shitpost I've ever seen. Congrats you fucking psycho.
How long after cancelling?
Not gonna happen

Don’t worry the govt will give you $600 back when you lose 100% on this.

What even is all the negative news you speak of
How many different corona shots u think we can take in a year?
this isnt r/investing. get some cash and play it out again
Tsla
Yes
Thanks man. I just learned about the vxx the other week and have been wondering how to take advantage of it. I was thinking of buying some in the weeks before the inauguration. Figure if anything crazy and volatile is gonna happen that would be a good time.
this might be the most 🌈🐻 statement I've ever read in this sub
Yea I don’t get it either...
Getting $1800 stimmy bucks for me, the wife and one kid. 

What is my yolo?
Did you not see stimulus passing 15 minutes before futures opened? How are we red tell me?
Congrats and fuck you
$MT gonna make a lot of happy retards round these parts
As long as she isn’t a gold digger. But seriously congrats man. 

No one will date a balding man in my late 20’s like me

So what is stopping the government from extending the back rent/taxes time period?
Naaaaaaiiiiiice! Congrats on this new adventure. Hope this was a good year for you!
Not if the yolo that 600 on black..I mean weeklies
I have a very good friend, who I love to death, on disability because of his weight. He hasn't worked or paid into the system for 10+ years. He's already whining because the last stimulus package didn't include him and this one won't either.

I'm not a heartless man but this mentality grates on me. I can't say anything to him so I'm saying something to you.
Impregnate that immediately
Bro just buy a red barons and tell her you ordered out and spend the $35 on a plan B instead
**Clearly** the biggest retard here.  
Congrats.
Not even enough for one Tesla share. 

Congress, Come on man!
they should make video games into a job
You must be new here
Stimmy!!
tf that better be some bomb ass pizza for $35 a pie
I sold a 170 naked call on this. Hope i get assigned so i can be short 100 shares on this till it goes to $40
$VLDR. Two big contracts last week, Cramer on board, monthly option manipulation now out of the way. Started to move AH Friday, bigger moves expected Monday premarket, $24 EOW. I bought in on Friday as MMs tried (and failed) to pull it sub $20.

Did u not read the post? Like literally the entire post detailed why you should pick $mt, bruh.
[deleted]
ok that makes no sense 😂 and if you really did trade futures you wouldn't be looking at [investing.com](https://investing.com) as a recourse since their deltas are always wrong and you'd be watching for gap fills but whatever floats your boat  🤡
Oh...

Fucking mcds next door has WiFi wtf! If your homeless you had the time to walk and find wifi.
Thank you 8.6oz baby Jesus for the +2trillion about to be invented, if only there was a currency a person could buy to hedge this debasement
[deleted]
I just want the stimulus to pump Intel so I can get out of these positions. After that I'm never touching Intel again. that shit fucked me up Friday.
I’ve got 300£, any suggestions on what stock to buy??
Retard question of the day...

Why can I not just get /NQ on tos mobile... always has to be like /NQZ20 /NQH20 or some shit. Idk what those even are
RiSk mAnAgEmEnT
Believe you can transfer your plates here big dog
Saw u/vitocorlene and didnt need to read the DD. Plus this is r/wsb, I cant read anyways. $MT GANG 🚀🚀🚀🚀
I agree, excited to see how they move tomorrow.
With all the autists assuming the moon with the stimulus passing, I’m now convinced this will be what happens.  Sell the news right?
At 6:31 they matter. Agree at 6:30 they don't.
Probably san francrisco
> Just would need a few tweaks

so we inject people with new version of vaccine every week as new strains develop? sounds bullish
I would love a sell off so I can get back in after taking profit have well over six figures in cash. But let’s be realistic we are gonna go sideways or drop slightly to 365.
Please explain like you are at a Wendys

This is just Phase I my friend. Small correction in January then Phase II bull starts.
Wtf kinda phone Schumer got that thing looks 3 feet long?
username checks out
The only semi dip tomorrow will be on reports bears in mass are canceling their Christmas gifts that they bought in anticipation of a super red Monday.
So this is the stimulus futures huh
Let's see some bean pics
Nah man, help the dude out. I've volunteered in shelters and while, yes, some are just bad people in general many are just people really down on their luck or have made a bad decision and are now paying a devastating price.
Why
Should I get into both NVTA and CRSP or just play it safe with ARKG
[removed]
holy shit lmfao this is one of the best memes ive ever seen in my life
Imagine if they did that in March....
I'll try it out your way next time just to see the difference but yeah eggplant is the best thus far. It absorbs the fat from the meat so well
So much ice.
Ber take their Ws in the first hour of futures. Bulls take their Ws all week
I hope to god this red holds until 930 AM. The bounce up will be epic.

It jumps with big corrections but also rises with gradual sell offs, will buy in the money
sounds like you're gay or she's ugly

Thanks son!
Buy the dip! We will be green by morning, and at the moon by EOW!
More stimmy was priced in, or new virus strain scaring people, or SPY rotation into DIS after mandalorian season finale
Anyone who tells you something is priced in is just bullshitting. It's just a convenient way to rationalise the market.
RemindMe! 18 hours
Fake news, this guy is ready to sell you calls, to reap your loss.
Green futures by market open
Yay another $600 to gamble in the WSB casino.
always have some cash and also have some stock exposure.
Probably 1-2k over the next 2 months, I was an early bird I already made nearly 2k in 3 days
She’ll want the prenup too, so she doesn’t inherit the -40k Robinhood balance and naked leaps when she leaves him
Does her bf approve?
they build gyneese military EVs bro, they on the choppo blocko
Tomorrow will be red because it will not be green.

*Mic Drop*
It’s down $0.25 on a $3,700 index, I ain’t worried
Where the fuck is someone paying $35 a pie
Put your retard hand in mine
The mutated covid variant is not exactly apocalypse scenario. Sure, it is observed to transmit faster which could overwhelm the hospitals but the vaccines that are being developed should be able to handle any mutation. Just would need a few tweaks. So in the long run it doesn't change anything.

Said the nervous call holder as he refreshes his E trade account looking at his 10 years of life savings wrapped up in Spy calls about to evaporate
Rotate into tech lmao
Hahahahahaha I was trying to buy one to resell when it first came out with no luck. I gave up. 10/10 would short
Monday = red
In 3 hours futures are going to be redder than the devils cock
Imagine thinking futs at 6:30 on a Sunday matter
It’s a video game lol. It will never have real value. Anyone who thinks otherwise is honestly fucking stupid. I’m sure you can make a quick buck the same way you can on the steam store selling fortnight skins or whatever the children do nowadays. But that doesn’t make it an investment. It’s an in-app purchase. And when revenue dies down the maker will just start releasing DLC content

$600 per person seems really underwhelming do you think it's gonna be enough to keep the market up.

*The crunching of broken glass can barely be heard beneath the screams.*

"Please!" the bear begs. "I don't want to die. I just want to have a red day. Please!"

The bear writhes and screeches, but the cries fall on deaf ears.

Nikola Tesla doesn't utter a word.

This side of the hill is littered with broken bottles, discarded fast food trash, and used syringes. This downslope is forsaken. The bears desperately eek out a meager existence here in the shaded canyon of sorrow. The bear has not seen another bear for days.

*The shade of Nikola Tesla drags the bear inexorably up the hill, toward the light. Toward certain death.*

"But you aren't real! You're dead!" cries the panicked bear, continuing his thrashes pointlessly. "It makes no sense that you can do this!?"

*Tesla pauses for a moment and looks back. They are only steps from the top of the hill now, and the light is blindingly bright.*

Tesla casts a deep and searching look into the bear's eyes.

"That's what the last one said."

*The shade of Tesla seizes the throat of the bear with ephemeral fingers, tighter than any vice. The bear struggles to fight, but it may as well be fighting the tide. With a single swift punch Tesla crushes the bear's skull.*

Tesla takes a moment to straighten his incorporeal suit, and surveys his handywork.

"Now if you will excuse me, I have a date with the S&P."

*Tesla turns, and continues his measured gait up the hill.*
It's a cyclical commodity, so technically long dated calls and puts will both make you money...
Boyz give me something to yolo tomorrow.
I ain't gonna live forever
For a $600 check from the US treasury and Tesla $969 by end of week I’ll put a load in her
Good luck finding one at that price
Its 100k a year chief, that's like every Csci grad 5 years out
porn accounts for around 30% of all internet traffic and has been around since the inception of the medium. multiple boom and bust periods.

yet there has never been a successful entrant into the public markets from the adult industry. ever.

the payment gateway controversy with pornhub pretty much shows you the appetite for this industry from the institutions, even today. it's still radioactive. managers don't want to have answer questions about their positions in onlyfans from the moral majority (ie boomers) knowing the next "child porn" bomb might be around the corner. do you think goldman wants to underwrite that IPO and expose themselves to that kind of risk?

the adult industry doesn't want the hassle either. Onlyfans and other porn companies print money for free privately with very little scrutiny. look at every journo under the sun raking DASH or ABNB over the coals just for their valuations. what do you think they'll do if OnlyFans IPOs? the owners of these companies would rather not deal with even more people trying to turn over rocks.

it's basically the final frontier in the markets, but not today, and not tomorrow either. maybe in another 20 years.
do u know how many tsla/gme/pltr shares u couldve bought with that money?

Considering the shit ton of  negative news .. futures just 0.2% down after 30 minutes , not sure why bears are so happy abt that .

 Atleast 1% down by now could be something to celebrate it .
I was proper getting into that and forgot I was on wsb memes..... Gutted when it stopped ... Whats the full song? Lol

Damn, and do you think that'll net? I'm a small fish and even though I want to make money I'm a pussy. 

I'm down for risk when it comes to something stable and long-term but tossing 3k into this makes my butthole clench

Who tf trusted you with so much money?
Probably because stimulus passed and futures didn't hit limit up and was actually slightly red earlier. On the other hand, it barely dropped so could go either way, most likely green though. Hit new ATHs right at open.

No one fucking cares.
You'll more or less break even if IV stays the exact same and you're selling premium. Since you're short volatility on both sides, if there's a substantial increase in volatility you LOSE.

You're fucking stupid if you sell premium and think you're net neutral vol.
Afraid of standard sell the news event

I'm honestly not totally fucked, but I bought 4k worth of SPY 12/21 375 calls last thursday and diamond handed them thinking that the crazy Friday market plus stimulus would pump us above. Those are fucked.

Still have a ton in AMD leaps and AMZN shares, ARKK shares, and some GME at a reasonable price, and a good chunk in CRSR.
that's a completely different reason, then.
WSB sentiment: confused

Going long on the dollar because fundamentally i need to go short due to stimmy/inflation
She’s already full of load
Congrats, your sister has a lovely hand.

Probably because it didn't go down that much which means moon mission incoming. That or some are looking at the wrong numbers on CNBC.
**FUTURES UP ON HOPES OF FED PRINTING VACCINE FOR NEW CORONA STRAIN**

Hey man saw some of your other posts and I’m not sure exactly what you’re shooting up but my close friend lost one of his high school buddies from that kinda stuff. Take care of yourself man.

Has no effect on vaccine, vaccine treats the spike of the rona.
don't mean shit if the vaccine is effective. shit is 🅱riced in
Lol cnbc trying
Unless there is mention of another stimulus check and extra unemployment all of those stimulus talks will be irrelevent mark my words. Also RIP UK
Hope PENN hits 95 tomorrow
You get $600 :(
I'll take the higher delta the 126 calls bring.  Vega will prolly increase until expiry as well.   Stimmy plus buybacks allowed plus more vaccine  = a good week for the banks.  watching wells as well.
Tech is up so the morning drill is more dramatic.
Check if your local Wendy’s is hiring
Amen hallelujah
Alright you autistic fucks. . . how many times did you beat your meat thinking about GOEV and all the hookers and coke you'll be having cuz you have positions

You’ll be good, we’ll see how tomorrow plays out. I’m planning to hold for a week minimum I am very confident we see $16 minimum, maybe $20.  
Godspeed retard
What would you say the minimum amount would be for ok profit?
I hope so!
the market moves on hopes and dreams, what hope and dream exists after the stim is over? actual recovery? that takes a while.

tech will be fine :)

maybe having TESLA included in the index the day of a stimmy vote and lockdown part was not a good idea, they should of included tesla on a different date.
Why is it gonna go up tomorrow ?!?!
I was kinda expecting a pump and for them to dump during market hours since stimulus is priced in 🤷‍♂️
There used to be a generation of bears who were respected. They knew not to come out unless we were at least -1%. The new generation is so desperate for any spare change they will come out even when futes are still green from Friday close. Sad life

Web traffic analysis shows eBay, Amazon, and Walmart are NOW at peak traffic for the year. Also, you've got to think about the release of next-gen consoles, which are typically sent with insurance and larger boxes, packages of that nature are typically 50% more expensive. But I doubt FedEx nor UPS will actually have a rally like the one in summer, that'd be too easy, and is most likely priced in.
If they are bringing back PPP I’ll go in for more. Got like 16k last time

Wait, futures are actually green still. Y’all remember that bullshit on Friday AH. Lol it’s about to show up on investing.com

Tech is in fact up right now yes
Lmao can I get a bear trap one time in the chat???

lmao barely red and everyone freaking out chill
Yep. Too many red flags associated with the lead up to stim passing. It’s a weak deal.
We just some MF kidz
TSLA would have to *plummet* to even touch SPY

Can we stop shilling PLTR yet? I love this stonk but it's market cap at 26 is 45b. Stock goes to 100 and you got at least a 185b cap if they don't do an offering. Not gonna happen any time soon. Let's find 1-10b cap companies for our multibaggers

Nah stimulate the economy, buy a dildo for your bf
Not a loss per se but I sold 65 pre-split shares of Tesla in Feb for $55k gain. Would be worth $200k today

The price really spiked in 2018. 2019 was the death of a thousand cuts. Prices were the highest in January and declined all year. There was too much supply >>> demand. Remember the price increase were also mainly due to Trump tariffs. Mills didn’t benefit from that like Arcelor.  All it did was make people race to buy steel and too much was bought, short term dynamic that didn’t help foreign mills. It stabilized US prices however and since then US mills have been somewhat insulated.
Stimulus too little. Need trillions 🤡. Small businesses and boomer companies need more help. Back into tech boyz!

Bears in shambles once again
Shitload of overvalued stocks getting a further pump? Sure I’m ready, after all 2021 can’t be worse than 2020 right? No way there’s something crazy coming like a tech bubble pop. To the moon! Or whatever.
Men should get more. We are losing 1 dollar for every 76c women are losing.
While I agree stock is over valued AF, Not a good idea to buy puts for couple of reasons. 

 1- puts are being sold in nickel increments rather than pennies.  This gives MM an edge over you. 

2- puts are expensive AF due to high implied volatility.
We have been stimulated
Stimi tendies will be the best Xmas gift. I really don't give a shit about anything else.

They’re going down to shoot back up. Like a catapult.

Still has a ways to go, including Cheeto who is rage fuking the whole country. Probably will pass but uncertainty isn’t helping.

Retarded question for you. IPOB on Friday was like $29 something. OPEN opens at $102.95. If you had 100 shares at $29 on Friday in IPOB, do you now have 100 shares at $102.95 tomorrow?
What price should we get into Tesla tomorrow? Expecting a huge drop?
Huh? Tesla is still in QQQ...just like AAPL/AMZN/FB/others who are in both QQQ and SPY.

UberEats is present in more international markets so I believe overall volume is greater compared to DD, but those intl markets are expensive. They sold or shut down a lot of those markets recently.

DD dominates the US market though. 50% market share compared to only 25% for UE.

I used to work for Ampco Pittsburgh (AP) and received a call from one of my buddies that still works there about 2 weeks ago and the steel price subject came up. What the OP is talking about does have some serious merit regardless of who he works for at this point.  I have stocks and 4/21 calls  in MT, AP, and CLF.
Selling the news and getting stim to buy the dip = bulls still win in the end

"We've agreed to a package of nearly $900 billion, with targeted policies that help struggling Americans who've already waited entirely too long," Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said.

You're profiting off the newly destitute American citizens.

Puts may be warranted. Dell already dropped 2.68% on this. They may continue to go down but not to the same degree as VMWare would.

Dell at least has an extra degree of separation from the dumpster fire.

Hey guys. I downloaded robinhood. What buttons do I press to become rich. Help.
Funny you see them as rich people instead of people that created lasting legacies that have changed industries. Steve Jobs as the face of Apple changed the way phones and personal electronics are looked at and Elon musk as the face of Tesla has jumpstarted a switch from fossil fuel to electric vehicles. It’s sad you don’t have a desire to at least create anything useful or make an impact with your life.

Love to see a big red candle with the dow and Nasdaq up, you know it’s sector rotation time into big tech
tech green cause it's less dependent on the fed? or because that's where the stimmy checks are gonna go?

To be honest this $900b was already expected anyway. I think people forget we are at all time highs with the economy constantly needing stimulus check to keep it afloat. 

This is not April when expected stimulus checks would gap the markets up.

What are my moves tomorrow? Depends on FOMO and caffeine intake.
I’m selling covered calls this week just because it’s an easy 1-2% for a short trading week for 15% OTM options that , if needed, I can probably buy to close for minimal loss Thursday. But then I’ll probably hold off until the pltr tech showcase in January since I’d anticipate more news coverage around vaccine distribution data analysis and general hype
I can also tell you when to short Pizza companies based on the price of block cheese futures on the CME. It’s the highest cost ingredient to pizza makers. It was getting close this summer.

Singed eh bud. Take a lap
Yep, me too.  I was impacted by Covid, but I'm protected under California's tenant relief act.  It basically allows renters to defer all rent until Jan 31st, at which point you have to pay 25% of back-rent or be evicted starting Feb 1.  The other 75% becomes civil debt; you can be sued for that but not evicted.  Some states may pass or extend their own laws if the federal bill is insufficient.

GLD should finally commence pushing through resistance with stimmy+ mutation uncertainties
CyberPuts 2021
Lol buying power. Only have $338. Bought 377c’s Friday and used up a few grand buying upro after hours
Passed stimmy and we are red. Fml.
Married 13 years. I agree with this. Got my knob knobbed this morning.
Stimmy is coming in hot
DOW futures down, SPY and NASDAQ up lol
Vix = up

peepee = up
someone who gets it!
I mean we are technically green if you adjust for Friday’s after hours movement which investing.com will eventually do.
How much was the diamond?
Are futures up or down? I can’t tell
What did they post? Lol
Hope AMD dips so I can get in on a couple of calls
I think they should call us Guppa
Bears eating tomorrow. This is some dedicated selling.
I like nothing better than arguments to justify why I'm already balls deep
Imagine for just a moment what it takes to be a bear. 

You have to be hoping day in and day out for a crash so that you can watch your family and loved ones lose their 401k while you alone make money. All so that you can say “I told you so”

Absolutely pathetic people.
What happened to all the DD that used to be here?
That was Friday
When will y’all ever learn it’s sell the news?
CREDIT SPREADS FREE MONEY 💰
You just realized!
How ironic is it that the government gives me 600$, and I immediately bet it all on the market tanking.
Prediction: SPY will open bigly green and bleed off tomorrow
Consistency
CNBC futures showing market up 1%
Let's say that you have ten years of time to spend $8M on heroin before you die from heart failure at age 27. That's 3652 days, which is $2K a day. So you buy the most expensive, luxury Berkshire Hethaway Heroin which you can find. It's $100 per shot. Since sleep and eating are no longer a thing, you can't even afford one shot every hour. It's still not a life-changing amount of money, gotta YOLO the fuck out of it.
IWM red AF
The macro trend of this market is bullish, but on a smaller scale (intraday/week) we will be pulling back from recent ATH’s before another push is made. I will be shorting this market temporarily and buying the dip for better positioning on the inevitable rise 

Taking a close look at EV as they’re retracing from that recent huge run but will assuredly go much higher for the coming months, especially with Biden recently affirming building more EV charging stations which will encourage the shift to eco-friendly vehicles
Yessssssss
i concur. to the moon and beyond.

(CNN)Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced Sunday evening that leadership from both chambers have reached a deal on "a package of nearly $900 billion" of much-needed relief for the Covid-19 pandemic, though Congress still faces a government shutdown deadline at midnight.
EDIT: imaging being a bear .. ahahahhaha
Investing dot com math is incorrect.
It's all bears you're not missing anything
One thing about this stock is I can poke a hole in the logic on either direction. I won't buy anything on this, it's a big question mark.

I’ve answered this question many times. I guess it’s hard for people to understand you can have more than one job. I have worked in steel for 25 years. Own my own company. I no longer handle the day to day, but still am President. I have investments in other companies. One of which is an EV here in the Midwest. I am procuring steel for them with my relations overseas and in the US. I also own Dominos franchises.
Seems like nafta ain’t gonna help them out divesting from US anymore.

I fuck with these charts and have been thinking doordash was incredibly overvalued like the rest have been.
Lol within 5 minutes of futures opening, CNBC's prewritten pump piece is already obsolete XD.
I wish, I forgot to buy on friday 😭

Before COVID I owned a vendoring business. I had contracts with several stores across two states to help organize and promote their tournaments. I'd buy cards at buylist (about half but of course it varies) and then sell them at retail. Mostly local sales, I didn't sell online until this year.

COVID shut that down hard as you can imagine. 

If you have any questions I'll answer to the best of my ability. My recommendation is if you're not sitting on inventory don't get into Magic finance. The stock market is honest and fair compared to the Magic secondary market.

Cool story bro.
Christmas week and second Stimmy gets approved. If you think it’s gonna be a red week then you deserve to lose all your money
Pour one out for the yes-voters for the $3.4T package back in May, they tried to propel us to SPX 5000.


Too bad Mitch is a bear :/
Lawl, according to your logic everyone must be driving mercedes s class right now, but they aren‘t. Wanna know why? Too expensive. 

According to your logic tesla is just a cars company which is completely wrong. 

Germany is SO BAD in terms of digital technology. They are never ever getting as good as tesla in self driving. Their government is sucking the milk out of them with the green deal.
TSLA's been given sub-$100 pt's recently. Doesn't mean too much imo. The only significance behind Susquehanna's pt is that it pumped DASH for a single day, but I fully expect it to crash in the upcoming week or two.
Please clarify if you actually work in the steel industry or not. You said you worked in the EV industry in your past comment. Explain yourself.
Your username is one letter off from confirming this
You get your information from GTAV or something?
Come on bears, open red so we can buy more calls because we’re mooning when stimulus passes. Can’t even drop 1% with all the bearish news this weekend and no stimulus yet... it’s all about stimulus and it’s up, up, and away with it

No, he never responded. go check his comment history. It’s very deep in there he said he worked in the EV industry. I have screenshots if he ends up deleting it. Like I said I still like the steel play but keep in mind this is a cyclical stock, so could very much end up like the oil tankers. I think there’s a potential with steel and op might be lying to get more people on the potential growth but still... this is not how u are suppose to do credible dd(option price also rocketed after we all went to buying, he could well be emptying his load onto us). I was actually trying to hype up the stock in the daily chat because I thought his dd was good but after realizing op is lying, it’s very hard to respect his dd.

SPY red on Bloomberg now fam.
Fedex stations are super backed up with packages, over 100 trailers sitting because package loaders are not coming in to work. Delivery volume is not that bad but pickups are high, but like someone else said, they don’t have to pick up all packages
For people wondering why the market is red, what are the positive news stories the market should expect going forward? All the good news is over now. Covid infections are back in the menu boys
blood flat
Tech calls at the open boys.
Yes. It was a very dogshit package. Very.
Futures opened down. That stimulus is a joke. Put your $300 in calls
Hmm i joined, but every model just posts ads for more models, and before long it was all ads and I ended up unsubbing from everything and deleting my account.

I don't think they can neccessary grow revenue because they don't have anything unique that can't be easily copied by competitors.

If i think of it in terms of porters 5 forces theres

 Low barrier to entry because any platform that caters a bit more to models or removes some of the pain points could capture the market share

Threat of substitute is high because porn.

Supplier bargaining power is high because models have low switching costs and can take their fans. Like I fap to the girl not to onlyfans.

Customer bargaining power is high because I can fap for free, and even if I'm simping, i'm simping on the girl not the platform.


And i forgot the last force. But you get the idea.
Dad?

They didnt vote on it yet little bitches , watch the hulk cock
And it's gonna be $4k soon. Very soon.
Holy Shit lol
Stimulus hasn’t passed.  It will be voted on by house, followed by senate and signed by trump Monday
Bulls downvoting again 😂
"Adult dependents are not expected to qualify for the stimulus payments, people familiar with the negotiations said..."

RIP half this sub.
Yes, more TA on PLTR's wedge. Guessing it's finally going parabolic this week... Right?
We’re gonna be so red (I’m a bull)
Aggressively dumping
Lmao
Not only that, but there are plenty of other stimulus driven plays that are much better opportunities and havens for big bank money starting this week. Alongside many others, I think you’re on the right track with this one. Let’s see how it plays out.
I like that and use stocks as chips where the value of the pot fluctuates and stacks drop or rise in real time.

BRK A can be the black chips and F can be the low chip and the ante is a TSLA chip.
A continent is about go on full lockdown.
Bulls used STIMMY!

&#x200B;

It was ineffective!
Futures up 0.1%
Bulls: futures bloody green. Bears r fuk!!!!

Futures down 0.3%
Bulls: futures flat 

Lmao
Just gimme 1200 bucks you fucking white wigs.
Yeah this is the rug pull it has to be

Don't be rude.
I don’t think you do and it’s smart to question your investments, but honestly PLTR is a unicorn and once in a lifetime, the only way they are going anywhere is if the US govt collapses and I think we’d have other problems to worry about at that point.

Bulls should be sweating bullets. The stimulus passes 15 minutes before open and futures are RED? Drill Team 6 reporting for duty!
Everything priced in now?
Finally futures opened. Time to go take a shower and jack off
Sadly nope. Dependent adults don’t qualify
Not even Stimulus can’t help it when corona is fucking everything
Sell the news. When will you guys learn
Holy shit futes dumping
Dow can shit the bed if Nasdaq moons, deal?
Yikes. Vix up big
Want more of what though? I could easily live a good, reasonable life at 60k. 

You saying that basically says that all people want are fancier cars, Biggers houses, fancy toys, party all the time. Thats not the ideal life to me. A lot of that is harmful to the environment anyway. 

And if you're using rich people as your argument thats pretty terrible.

Guh
VIX pumping a bit too hard for my liking
March 18 24c, 14 contracts

ROFL, Weekend Dow just fucked bears soo hard. Giving them hope all weekend. I bet they promised their bear cubs Christmas Gifts based on the weekend dow.

No Gifts Bear kiddos!
Hey man I get what you're saying but look at our current deficit. We will never make a dent in it. We're essentially trying to keep most of the world stable until we can start colonizing new worlds, or until Russia and China falls and the US becomes the de-facto only government in the world. 

Capitalism will die, we just can't let it happen yet. We as a society aren't prepared for it. But one day we will be.
DASH puts gonna prrriiiinnnntttt
Where do you get your futures data?

As her bf, thanks for the weekly checks
This is def not a good enough reaction to the stimmy I think my tsla calls are in danger 😨
Futures flat. No excitement. What did you idiots expect with a dogshit stimulus that’s been expected for weeks?


Ugh some of y’all be way too naive.


Not gonna lie, I expected more red because this package is tragic.
Lol where’d the bulls go. They were mad cocky a moment ago
Premature celebration, lmao
Circuit Breaker tomorrow would be bonkers
Algos have no clue what to do. Flat until market opens.
Imagine thinking we'd moon on a stimulus that was 25% of what was priced in previously. 🤡
Supposedly eviction moratorium extension is in the stimmy bill.
Covid didn’t hear no bell
Red
I try to guess futures prices after looking at the comments for 1 min here and I was expecting +0.5%, but it's literally flat🤡🤡🤡
Thanks man, I might just YOLO in this too, I’m just afraid I’ll hurt people
way priced in by now
Sell the news? I expected major gap up
I thought the weekend dow was right 100% of the time.
This time is different?
it's just a storm dick

Futures flat until europoors sell off
But but but!  The weekend Dow was blood reddddd
🅱️lood 🅱️lat lmao
Chuck Schumer is on the floor reading the highlights right now.  But there are lot of specific restrictions that will need to come from the bill text, e.g. income limits for stimulus checks, if they're still using your 2019 tax returns to determine that, etc.

Then good luck.  Believe it not, I don't have it in for PLTR.  OP said they wanted a counter-argument and that's the biggest concern I had with them.
Hope it dumps so I can buy in at a low

That's working income, cash in my hands. I am investing, but only started in November after clearing all my debt away. I'm lucky I have a 6 figure tech job now. But my portfolio is basically ARKG, ARKW, CRSR, and PLTR... I could probably be doing this better since I missed the runups on those other then PLTR. But I don't really know what I'm doing. Got 20k out there in the market now. Thoughts?

Would traffic not hinder the timeliness of deliveries? If traffic is your main concern, wouldn't you think that an influx of traffic results in an influx of deliveries that are late/delayed, causing customer dissatisfaction? It's significantly cheaper and more convenient to cook food at home if time is the main concern.
This isn’t your all time chart
Did OP respond about that? How do you know he's lying? I hope it's not a PnD..
Lol stupid 🐻
Hard green dicks in that ass
HOLY GREEN FUTURES
In the 1960s left wing socialists said there will be no more growth for computers because they are so freaking huge and fill whole rooms. 

„For Performance XXX GhZ they will need more space than new york city!“ 

Same with Oil. Oil is peaking according to idiots since 1980 and nothing happened. 

You know what happened? 

Wanna know? 

It‘s called technology. 

Yes moffa! 

Apple released in 2020 their M1 chip, the smallest and most performant freaking chip ever made. It’s as small as your dick.In 1960 you would have needed space for that performance - like new york city dimensions. 

And cars (oil) ? well, they also made improvements, just much slower. In 2020 they are more efficient than ever. I don‘t have numbers, but well bro I am not a scientist, I am WSB full autist. 

You get what I mean. 

DON‘T JUDGE ABOUT THE FUTURE if you don‘t price the growth of technology in. 

It can be that we don‘t need lithium in a few decades. It can be that we need much less lithium for same range as today. 

It can be, that there will be many other energy storages with different use cases. 

That‘s not fantasy. It‘s reality. Human Innovation never stagnates. 

Cuckolding never stops for gay bears. 

I get those tendies boooooys

OP downvotes every counter argument.
Thank you for this great post. I already got in last week and I might reinforce. As I was waiting for more news, I tried to check steel price and found this link which show less than stellar forecasts after it hits a peak in January https://tradingeconomics.com/commodity/steel 
Is this accurate in the current context? What are the signals to look for in the future to start getting our of the positions?
Pft 2 years is plenty of time to have a good time. Me and my wife move around together doing shit. Where you are isn't a big deal it's what you're doing and who you're with. That being said if you don't feel ready for a relationship there is no rush.
maybe ask them out?

I'm just spit balling here.

How can I delete someone else’s comment?
But you didn't lol, you kept pressing the gas and you may have been rewarded. These are the times, there's no wrong answer other than sitting cash for teh last year.... I am sitting cash a bit right now though to see how new year plays, let the stimmy pump what I have and be ready for dips where I can average down or get cheap calls that are sure to come back
its at 1992
600$ per person. This is great for families with 4 or more people and are earning under 75000$

if bears can do basic math that means a family of 4 gets 600\*4=2400$

PLUS

300$ unemployment benefits every week

PLUS

this is not the final stimulus the real battle will be the Georgia senate race first week of Jan if democrats control the senate can u imagine what the extended stimulus is going to be like?

The real win here is that our government won’t shutdown during a fucking pandemic. The other win is ima buy a ps5 with the money.
A lot of people in this sub next week : “But but but I thought stimulus was bullish?”
literally everyone thought there would be a stimmy between 500B and 1T between Nov and Jan
2 mins
This shit is gonna be flatter than Belle Delphine
You can’t ask that and not post positions
600 bucks per adult, per child but adult dependents are excluded.
Bulls r gonna shit bricks when futures open red and stay red
It’s mostly for college students like people living with their parents but aged 18+. They were the only group basically left out of the last stimulus besides people making over $150k. Seemed strange to do it before and people were pissed about it but congress is doing it again it seems
So we bout to see SPY 400 tomorrow I guess???
2 years is forever.  Shit changes.  Red heads are hot.

Do it.
This sub was not bullish until the rally was well underway, people were holding puts through the summer. If this sub was extremely bullish then you would have made money on the fat rally but you didn't, and no one is expecting SPY 220 again but being at ATH when 30%+ of households are on the verge of eviction is the perfect time to buy puts
thought it was a little unusual for that far OTM
Fuck 15$/hr $2.24/day is my jam!

I'm just getting the same baseline details and a dozen different stories on every website. Cnbc included
the fed only stabilized it a bit initially. IT wavered down until the massive pension fund buys on the day after xmas, with huge purchases in final 2 hours.

Yea. 75000 is the cap for full amount. 75-99 is a portion. Above 99 is nadda
I like this red head a lot and she likes me too, but I’m scared of a relationship when my future is not sure (maybe changing job/moving in the next 2 years) what should I do?

How much of the 900B is new stimmy?

Isn't most of it the Fed's left overs because they couldn't find enough solvent businesses to lend to?

They just sending this to WSB to gamble and lose it... seems stimulative

The market reflects rich people, not poor people. As long as the printers are still on, interest rates will stay low which is good for rich people. Stimulus = more brrrr.
Yeah that would be real funny bro

Right?! Thank god they took that language outta this bill
Id be sweating if i had puts right now.
Don’t what’s sarcastic about my statement?  We had an NDX boom trigger a 10% pull back, now we have a R2K boom that’ll trigger another 5-10% pull back. Everyone re evaluates for a bit then we grind higher. 

Every time we push ATH up we’ll be met with a smaller than previous correction and the rate of growth of the indices slows until we’re back to a reasonable rate of growth like the past 5 years where VIX cools back to the low teens

2 years of all bull until inflation control and interest rates catch up to the market or the housing market implodes. LIBOR is coming to fuck things up when we finally have to stop ignoring it

If the stimi mentions anything limiting the Fed or infringing on its autonomy *it do go down*
I'd prefer not to disclose the exact amount. Just know that I'll be living in a box and having ice soup for dinner for quite some time if this goes to shit.

Tough times call for tough measures
This is the way
3rd stimulus talks in the works
I did exhaustive research on LGVW. It’s, in my opinion, the safest SPAC with the most upside. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation have invested 200 million into their merger with Butterfly Network. 

Also Cathie and ARK own nearly 1 million shares in it and it’s one of only 2 pre-merger SPACs that they’ve ever owned. 

Once options become available it will easily double.

Bro that is the most guaranteed way to get it. If it is similar terms as last time, if you're making under $99,000 (or in your case $0 lol) you're good to go. 

You can even buy 1 whole 5/21/21 PLTR $6.15 C with it, already in the money!

if we've been mooning months due to stimulus hopes, doesn't it mean stimulus is priced in and this stimmy with shitty terms is really sell the news event.

I thought futures are supposed to open 6pm ET on sundays?
I just hope they push back the payments on federal student loans so I can keep feeding the markets my paychecks😤
What doesn't make sense is that if CLF is such a good company, why not just buy CLF? It's a lot easier for a company with a small market cap to go up huge than it is for a large company.  Also, is MT selling an asset to perform a share buyback really a good thing?  Seems very short-sighted.  Vertical integration is key, which is something CLF has going for it as well.  I think the rising tide will raise all boats, but I'm betting CLF will move the most.
He also said next one asap in july, so...
TLDR 

🚀🚀🚀
Even if it opens green, it will fade all day and close red but the most likely outcome is open red and stay red. There is simply too much fear mongering in the media right now and algos eat that shit up.
Stimulus: finalized 

Market: don’t let me get in my zone!

“Stimulus is priced in” imagine if u sold the rumor last time there was stimulus🤡🤡🤡🤡🤡
> They are not “locked” in any sort of way just because a contract is written on them.

And that shows just what you know about market dynamics.  Those were deep ITM calls that *absolutely* needed to be backstopped by shares.  There's no firm in the world that would sell the shares out from under the contracts leaving them naked.

If you think short to available float is so subjective, how can you possibly argue that GME only has 10% available float?

Because you know that all these hedge funds are gonna hold this thing until it goes to $500?

You're sitting here arguing the opposite of reality.  VW was locked down to almost 1% of the shares being available, and you're saying it wasn't.

GME is roughly 70% available, almost with certainty, and you're claiming it's only 10% available, with 90% locked.

You're in upside down world.
I don't think we prefer one over the other in our moderation though I voted Trump myself. We generally try to get rid of political BS if we see it. I don't read a lot of comments so you'd have to username ping me for me to see anything.
Bless Tim AAPL for pricing the Airpods at $550 right before stimmy passes 🙏
Only if you like money

But seriously though if you want a middle ground between going in on zoomer meme stocks and boomer index ETFs, I think ARKK is awesome. Mama Cathie picks winners
If he said, “Im going to prison” they’d be green AF.
Of course they break the stimulus news 20 mins before futes open

Still think we are fucked maybe pump tomorrow, but unless the dems take the 2 seats in Georgia no chance of any more stimmy. This deal was way too hard to get done when they both agreed it was needed. The stuff in Europe right now is sus, and vaccine roll out is going real slow.
Not a fan of X management. I like CLF - their management and vision is solid. Now it’s all about execution with their acquisition.  I think they can do it.

What we yoloing the stimulus on boys?
This stimmy is priced. What will move the market is the next one. And McConnel just announced they "gonna pass next one ASAP".
Fuck you rich 🅱️aggot. Why do the dumbest fucking people always get the luckiest.
mushroom stocks bay bee
PLTR TO THE MOON
What happend
The headline DD catalysts are in the video, and others are better than I for the details.

My own personal DD was just going to the mall for something else, and customers were in their store, vs other mall stores that were empty (medium level lockdown level locally). I asked one of the clerks about their PS and Xbox. They were obviously sold out, but they are now keeping such a long wait list for console sales, they are not adding any more names. My understanding is that there will be an announcement mid January from GME on how things are going with console cycle sales.

I think it is the only retail stock I can ever recall owning, as I typically don't like the space.

For the future, either the board follows Cohen's plan, or get replaced. My impression is that the board will want to get things done and not resign, since it is tough to not do well after a new console cycle, and they can all get a star on their resume even though it was the external times that made the recovery not the board.

I never foresaw Whole Foods getting taken out by Amazon. Why brick and mortar when can deliver?  Because there is sometimes value in a competitive on-the-ground network from an online, when others have a brick and mortar presence.

Competition for video game platform supremacy similarly is going to be intense in the next 10 years, with MSFT, APPL, GOOG (Stadia) AMZN (Twitch) in particular jockeying for position. Question is whether one of the large players (not APPL) would intervene and take over GME just to give them a few percentage edge on uptake of their particular platform, since $1B is pocket lint for them compared to the value of becoming the Oasis of the future, in a way to ante up against Apple with their Apple stores. The bought GME stores can be a combination of a Genius Bar repair/upgrade shop, showroom, and in-person live competition hub. The stores can run as a loss leader, similar to how Google pretty much gives away a Chromebook hardware to make money on services. MSFT would be my best guess as to who would buy GME, though they exited their retail stores a while back. The value of buying GME vs just starting your own stores is because it is the cutthroat solution, since it takes away the network that is currently selling your competitors products as well as your own. MSFT does this with video game software studios, not only to release their own, but to stop them to releasing them for other platforms.

Anyways, I reckon the next few weeks will bring some drama to this action film of a stock. Look forward to tuning in.

Edit: Typo fixes.
Yes me too... why though this looks better but still...
🍳🍳🍳
I heard stimulus may leave out robinhood traders, aka college students claimed as dependents by mummy and daddy...
Hope my SPY 12/24 $368c get stimulated
🤡
SPY 420 THIS IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF STIMULUS
It’s sickening. I know people that brag about being on unemployment and they make no attempt to get another job.
GME WMT BB Target 🚀
Both team up to beat up the bears
I’m so glad I bought calls on Friday for whatever ticker it was, honestly can’t remember. All I know is that they’ll go up tomorrow.
fuck i can't read but i'm all in monday anyway
Nah.. nothing big.  Individual ticker rise and falls - SPY up .78 @ open.
less than a month rent
It will when it splits again

Doesnt matter where futures open. Never has
BEars fucked and somehow still virgins 🤔
can't wait to buy more calls with my stimmy
Oh my god are you me
Printer
$600 won’t even buy me a single TSLA share 😢
At least 10k when all our calls print am I right my guyz!?
Lmao true also National debt only matters when it’s anything to actually help people. The defense spending budget easily passes meanwhile people bring up $1200 instead of $600 direct payments and congress is like “well we have to be careful of the deficit” lol
Ok. Who is going to take a stab in the dark, at the best (worst ) case scenario, potential upside for DD? These fucks need to tank, but it won’t happen without a fight. Need to work out how big I short - stops please?  I’m looking at riding till Sep 21... 🌈🐻(feel unclean)
Oh i'm fucking stimulated for tomorrow boys

OUR ECONOMY IS FUCKED BUT HOPEFULLY OUR CALLS PRINT BEFORE THEN
🤤
Im so fucking talented that even if we limit up tomorrow ill sell my calls for a loss
Hope you’re right but I am closing some calls Monday morning

[$600K selling call credit spreads] (https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/h0givj/600k_loss_in_6_days_selling_call_credit_spreads). About 15% of my net worth at the time.

It was extremely painful, but my net gains since then have been slightly more than the amount I lost.

Bears don’t even show up to futures tonight. I don’t wanna see the disappoint on your face during such a jolly time of the year.
Maybe you don't know his name, but you have seen him. Possibly many times.

McConnell (Balls deep in boomer shit like UAL & JPM): "future open in 30 minutes. we have to put something together so stocks go up, need to lock in as many gainz as possible before next year"


Pelosi (balls deep in CRWD calls expiring 12/24): "Agreed, lets do a reduced bill so we can leave the door open for more 'stimulus talks going well gains'

Mondays used to be always blood green but it's been red in the last few weeks. Also the whole media is talking about this new virus in England and shutdowns, so it will for sure be another red Monday tomorrow even with stimmy news.
What should my calls be?

I guess it depends on how limiting this is going to be on the fed. If it’s just ending the cares act it’s not really a big deal because that ended on the 31st anyway
The language being used for the press on the stimmy is vague, still seems like it could fall apart.
It’s been forever!

There's always pent up demand baby on we go 🍻
just agreement, hopefully for a vote tonight.
Yeah gonna be an entertaining week for sure

People here are knocking the $900 billion... but that’s $4 trillion in government spending on top of Fed assisting... that’s fucking an insane amount. Prob gonna be $400 SPY by EOY next year
Ok, thanks, good to know. I only put in a little on Friday, will hold off on expanding that position.

I'd love to help, for me it's a good long term hold with lots of upside and good catalysts. Then timing the market is pretty hard... If you go in with a lot of $$ you can always sell Covered Calls after... Good luck and may we all Print Large Tendies Regularly 🚀🚀
JPow personally called Mitch and said if you don't announce agreement before futures open we limit down.
u/savevideo
Hot take stimulus is the catalyst for a 10% correction. What more is there for the market to look forward to?
Mitch announced it has been agreed upon, still needs to actually go to vote but I doubt it will fail now if Mitch is saying it will at this point
Holy shit looool
I think it’s quite hard for it to go back to 17, unless they do another test flight and it goes bad again.
Didn't you watch the Cramer video? Pumping premarket is bad for the stocks.

Absolutely no one buys anything except PLTR
Which stock is flying tomorrow
I'm saying that this megasqueeze isn't realistic, despite the 100%+ short interest. What is realistic is a gradual rally to $60 by March/April, it trades sideways for a while and deflates back into low teens and single digits in 2022 and beyond

I'd LOVE for a MOASS to happen though, I hope it does. But hope is just that, wishful thinking.
Why is weekend DOW so red tho?
Soo.. is the dump shack you built still there?  Should be in good repair since you've been using it for the past 7-8 months right?

Well the short interest in th market dropped significantly
I guarantee we’ll see another stimmy after this one cause no one wants to wear a mask and no one wants to get a vaccine
Okay honestly what the hell do I do with my TSLA shares at open tomorrow
Stimulus passing is bearish. This is much lower than hoped and the market has been pumping on possible stimulus for the last three months.

Also, I don't think a pullback is impossible, I just think that we're not going to be seeing March levels anytime soon, which is what most bears have been proclaiming.
McConnell finally stimulated Pelosi after passing Johnny Sins course.
Stimulus is good news for airlines but gains will likely be tempered due to ongoing flow of negative virus news.

You hide that shit now. At divorce time they will be scouting everything. Put the principal back in  the account you got it from. Close your investment account and park the money in the caymans. In all fairness , you risked family money and if you lost it all she would be paying, so evaluate your moral implications
I'm going to go stroke one for the bears out there who keep buying spy puts and for that reason I'm out;)
What happened with Toomey's amendment? Does it affect QE?
Nah if anything sell off won’t happen till 9:30

No, incorrect. Short to float is the only thing that is not subjective. Short to available float is entirely based on what parameters you yourself set. 

In this case, I was mainly saying that short to available float for Porsche was based on a subjective measure that they could and would in fact exercise the options. However, until they do so, the stocks are still available to buy openly on the market. They are not “locked” in any sort of way just because a contract is written on them.

No you were supposed to wait until futures are open so I know this is legit
THE MYTH
Futures open
STIMI AGREEMENT REACHED BEARS R FUK
Why fucked?
So, my max loss was roughly $1080 not including commission but due to the wide bid ask spread at market close on Thursday 12/18 my account showed a roughly $-1500 P/L on the day(if both contracts were exercised my max loss would have been $1080 which was the .18 on 60 contracts in risk on the spread that I put up as I was aiming to pocket the .82 premium which was the max 5k payout on 60 contracts if the spread on both contracts went to .00 aka same price.) The reason my max loss was 1080 was because the premium from the spread minus the difference in strike price which was $1 so my max risk was the .18 because I was short the 370 and long 371. So if the 370s were assigned and I owed 6000 spy shares the 371 calls I was holding gave me the right to buy at 371 and cap my loss as after 371 I make nor loose any more money than the .18 I already did. The reason I made money was because the 370s were exercised, leaving me with the full premium from there sale to pocket which was just under $2, so I had -6000 short SPY shares to cover and the 371 calls were over the premium proce of what I payed. So I covered at 371.04 the 6000 shares leaving me with a loss shown in the pictures above on that short position in spy as I sold them at 370 and re-bought back at just over a dollar loss but I was able to sell my 371s for slight profit overall netting $5600. Sorry there was a lot of information in there please let me know if I need to explain more or if anyone needs to correct me for whatever reason. The bottom portion probably best answers your question.
It still hurts
VALE

4.) Second strain gets priced in as europoors sell that night as EU gears up to shut down Christmas
5.) US panic sells Tuesday as open and Pre Market reel back from TSLA gains and EU havoc 
6.) Circuit Breakers

"New infection records on the daily will surely make us limit down!"

But the thing is these MMs and complete psychopaths always hit you back with some pump shit like "stimulus is definitely passing this week!" "Vaccine distribution is starting!".

Charts like this crack me up. Like the collective sentiment and emotions of millions of traders and hedge funds 20 years apart somehow correlate in a meaningful way
So you want to know the future of a stock(in this case).  You make some assumptions about how some variables interact with each other.  Say for instance, and this one is simple...

1. If the Fed is dovish, then PLTR will go up.

You have a lot of these variable relationships in your model, but unfortunately you don't know the futures of many of the variables any more than you know the future of the stock.  So what the Monte Carlo Projection does, is just plug random numbers into all the unknown variables, and runs the sim, and plots the line.  Then it does this many many more times.  Then you just measure the density of the plotted lines, and the densest part with the most lines running through it, is the most likely place the stock will end up(assuming your model is right).  Looks like OP used a type that plotted where it should be, within say, one standard deviation or something.

That's the theory anyway.  In stocks, it's very inaccurate, since even getting the model right is extremely difficult.  The interactions between market variables are pretty elusive, even to institutional investors.

You buy a market or limit order first. Then you sell it as a trailing stop. You can trailing stop at a price you determine or a trailing stop % you determine. If you do a 1% trailing stop it will sell too fast and you’ll miss bounces up without knowing your sell went through.

If your goal is to hold longer term but save your ass from a massive dump set your tailing stop to a higher percent. Like 10-50%. 

Trailing stops are not aa s great as “influencers” make them. They say it to save their ass. Truth is its worse to set a trailing stop at 1% than it is 99%
What about the week Dow?
They will fix it like No Man's Sky, and their reputation will be ruined despite eventually producing a good game

Calls on eggnog
Thats assuming you did it on something risky like NIO or something with high volatility and premium.
Take something safer like NVDA, and selling puts at the ask and current stock price, (at this moment)  would Net 2340 per month if you had 53k for collateral. 

So double that, and you could make at least 4k a month with 100k on the sidelines. 

Easy 4% a month, or 48% per year.  And thats assuming the stock trades sideways the whole time.
no, it's because that's where the fish live
Wouldn’t be so sure. Zoom out and see what it does after run ups like this. It pulls back to about the 50 day pretty consistently. I’m neutral on TSLA, but it looks like it’s ready for that pull back soon.
If Dems win Georgia I don't know how likely that is though

Okay, I'm a SWE at the big G, and I 100% support puts for DASH for the sole reason that these so-called "tech" companies" aren't tech-heavy if their underlying business value (i.e. "technology" -- according to THEM) can be replicated by a bunch of beta-cuck sophomores using stupid-shit app-maker tools. I've seen such companies time and time again, and all they've ever done is offer coupons to customers so as to appease their venture capital boomers with fake growth... until finally their runway runs out and they crash-&-burn. As soon as they stop offering discounts, out goes the fucking repeat orders. Customers are as loyal as AIDS-ridden degenerates looking for the next coupon-offering whore-of-a-company.

Bullish.
Nothing really. But when you look at the technical chart of the last 20 years by month the 2000 bubble is the only thing that remotely compares. So I compared them and adjusted for magnitude and made observations. Obviously not set in stone but gave my feeling we might have more room to run before we relay hit bubble max. I think we are good for another 6 months but never need to re evaluate chart in 3-6months.
We have been hearing this for months.

They're already available. I forget the exact dates, but I believe there is an expiry at roughly May21, as well as strikes in June and August. Would definitely consider those longer dates puts for a safer play that will still print.
Na this sell-off is a huge overreaction.  Game plays fine on PC.  It'll be patched to run properly on next gen, but last gen is fucked.  To my point though, they're upgrading the Witcher 3 to next gen, which should sell like hotcakes.

Not in and of itself but it's a question worth asking why a fund focused on this specific niche area didn't feel this company was worth including in its portfolio. ARKG holds 30-50 investments at any given time and this company is definitely in the top 20 in terms of market cap in this space.

That is pretty much exactly what they do just in a more glamorized form. The holding aspect is the real risk factor if you believe the housing market is overvalued.
this is what options are actually useful for

you could set aside a fixed amount per month to hedge, and it becomes like an insurance premium to cover any large unwanted moves

you would need cash coming in though, and it would make sense only for large holdings

Technically they already took control of part of ANT, a few years back they sold the CCP their inter-bank settlement system. Think Chinese version of ACH.
Biochem student here, if you read all those articles and Twitter threads talking about the new strain, you would know that it’s not a worry as is, our vaccine codes for the viral spike protein that acts as the foreign body that our immune system responds to. 

The mutated virus has identical suriface and spike proteins as 229E, the current strain. It should not lower efficacy as is, maybe further down the line due to antigenic drift but we can be prepared for that much like the flu

All chamaths spacs have gone to 30, official merger is in January and this is a $5 billion dollar healthcare company that I don’t think belongs any lower than $20 or $30 a share in the short terms, and much more than that in long term
I remember when WSB used to be 70-30 or 80-20 in favor of bulls. Now it’s 99-1. 


Or actually 100-0, I still haven’t found a bear.


You guys keep posting “haha you bears are so dumb” and I can’t fucking find the bears you’re referring to.
no stim, maybe more lockdowns. everything else you wrote was retarded
Based on what?
Friendly reminder when shit hit the fan before in March, the big money and Congress got a heads up while the administration told everyone it wasn't a big deal.  Be skeptical and hedge.  This may well be a nothing burger, but you would not know otherwise until it was too late.

If you ever see a strike on WSB check to make sure the price isnt pumped up already. You'll see the strike is at +13% for example, while the strike above is +9% and the strike below is +4%. It's obviously in too much demand.

I usually buy one nearby the one mentioned by any OP unless I'm getting in early enough to avoid the mini-pump.

You should at least have a chat with a CPA if you’ve had a really good year.  You’re supposed to pay taxes on gains on a quarterly basis, which most people aren’t thinking if you’re having your first year of large gains or having a year of outsized gains.  There are some safe harbor rules that you can discuss to reduce your exposure (but still need to pay interest).  This is based on my own situation and discussion with my CPA, and obviously your situation might be different.  But at least look this stuff up on your own and have a quick chat with a CPA.
Because, there isn’t much growth in the future. You’re better off buying Walmart instead of Walgreens

Not sure how I did that either, this was my first post here. I'm not swinging an options currently, I'm a scalper at heart that usually goes for 20% gains on the hourly. That was my first swing trade in over a month, my day trade record is much better than my swings. I usually enter trades at 10 and like to get out before 11. I took this swing as the risk reward was roughly 1:5.5 and I liked the odds.

Idk about y’all, I’m glad I’ve got calls!

Bul hold the line, it’ll come back, but we probably aren’t winning tomorrow. Btfd, but average down and keep some powder dry.

I’ve been pretty successful averaging down when I’m 20-25% down on my original call up to 2-3 times. Anything past that and it’s in bul god’s hands.
Correct. And USPS delivers to remote areas that are not served by UPS or Fed Ex. They would operate at a gain if allowed to charge the same rates as private competitors and didnt have to honor 10 year old stamps

It's all about *economies of scale*. The first vehicles that Tesla made were the Roadster, model S and X, only rich or well off people could afford them. Now they have the Model 3 and Y, and are working on an even cheaper car.

Initially, yes, space flights will only be for the rich. But once they get the *economies of scale down* anyone with a decent job will be able to travel in space.

The one caveat holding me from being excited is the backlogs they're working through, and how much additional cost they're going to have to take on to resolve the overflow.  I know UPS told several stores they won't be doing any store shipments, not to mention all the ones who were part of that Black Friday blacklist.

That sucks.
You can't eliminate volatility, you just move it from one place to another. When you "force" the economy to be stable, all you're doing is pumping money into it to suppress volatility artificially. Where does that volatility go? It can bleed out of the markets into social unrest for example. Do you think widening the wealth gap and destroying the currency is leading to a more functional society?
I’m planning on buying the dip
I'm sure it has nothing to do with Louis Dejoy gutting the agency. The same guy with 70 million invested in USPS competitors. The Trump donor rallying against USPS before being appointed to lead USPS.

So did you help her??? What did you tell her to buy? GME or PLTR?
Selling options is short volatility. Sell calls, sell puts, you're still shorting volatility because you expect vol will be within/below expectations.

If you're long vol to hedge, fine.. but now you're also negative theta. If you sell puts on VXX, you're still shorting vol in the form of VVIX.

Movie is set in the 2040s, so that would be backdated inflation around $300B or so, about the size a Disney. 

Facebook is $700B already, though they have gone the route of the Ready Player One villain and killed the user experience in chase of monetization.

Probably the best near-term price estimate will be the Roblox pricing, at least until the perhaps Reddit IPO someday.

What’s the order? House, senate then president?
ATH on Friday will be the new floor.
All week long, theres been a sense of urgency to pass a new stimmy. They were talking about getting it done tonight like it absolutely had to happen or otherwise it was going to fall apart. Now its "Oh, Senate will meet in the morning. No big sweat"

Ya, this reeks of bullshit, they know they're not going to close a stimmy. My theory is they want to wait to as close to open as possible so that they can make the announcement and then pull out of the market before everything plummets
Bears excited cuz weekend dow massively red. Have the fear bulls, stimulus is gonna be approved soon and bears will be in shambles.
Yeah I don’t think bandwidth will be a major bottle neck but I can look again.

Technical challenges are probably:

- making sure content is secure (hosted on aws with signed URLS probably)
- figuring out a system for letting users create their own subscriptions and then paying them out each month/week or whatever

- having a process for verifying age/getting relevant info for taxes

truly the most retarded thing on r/wallstreetbets

Probably but we’re probably going to tank this week cause stimulus 2 won’t be passed then up and up. Then start peaking when Biden come into office and he passes the 2nd stimulus then maybe around March we’ll see a sell off

Y’all retards know futes ain’t even open yet right
I don't even know where to start with this.  First of all, college kids make advances in tech literally all the time.  As for backing, ask the Door Dash students, who are now billionaires I believe, despite the fact the company isn't really even profitable yet.  So could a college kid sell the most advanced espionage A.I in the world or find financial backers to start their own company?  Yeah, instantly.  Selling it outright to the U.S. government would be a quick way to make cash, since they would have an interest in keeping it out of the public's hands.  But finding investors is stupid easy too.  I think *you* don't understand how this works.  It's not about this theoretical kid vs. PLTR, it's the about the rich business man/U.S. government who would like to take PLTR's model for themselves and are willing to pay the kid to get their way.  You know what's more secure than PLTR?  The N.S.A., so why not cut out the middle-man for a one time payment?

Who let the bears out?
Possible worse COVID strain has developed. There will be a short but substantial dip tomorrow. Then in a few weeks depending on the severity it will bleed or pump. Def gonna move tomorrow though.

Stop losses? They are for pussies.
Oh shit, really!?

Of course it's so the company makes more money. That's beside the point. The point is the state is losing millions in direct corporate and personal income tax revenue, and billions in economic activity from those high income families living and spending in-state. When they start leaving in droves, you should be worried.

Use a trailing stop loss.
Why's everybody so bearish tomorrow? Bank news is bullish as can be, stimulus is coming soon.

One of them survived the blast and looked like a surreal fucked up drawing of Popeye lol
 

**Is the next stimulus gonna be a Starbucks gift card for $20.00.**
TSLA seems to pull back to the 50 day after run ups like this. Would mean a pullback to around 500 or so from where it is now, then bounce a bit, and flat for a while until catalyst such as upcoming ER. This is my crystal ball prediction.
Bro turkey the easiest thing

Thanks OP for sharing this data! It’s just amazing to see how volatility affects option prices.

Now I am just curious how easy it is to buy options @$.01-$.05 at market open?
Here here:

INTC 50C 1/29

MT 24C 4/16

and GOEV 17.5P 1/15  ;)
But she also bought it the day before AAPL mooned 5%
Thats usually what I do with any dated options around 30-50% profit. First take initial invest +10% and let the rest ride
how do you guys play stop losses on long term holds in case of a crash? do you constantly update your stop loss after the stock makes a run?
CCL puts at open. Overall I think things will all be okay, but this might be enough to push Carnival in bankruptcy territory.

Maybe you're right - I'll admit that I don't have the slightest clue on how a GirlsDoPorn type scenario would *actually* be adjudicated for OnlyFans. But from what I've gathered in some sex worker/onlyfans-based subreddits, the process is still fairly confusing and murky. Add in the recent Pornhub situation and the UK's constant hounding of OnlyFans for missed taxes, onlyfans likely won't be given any leeway from the anti-porn crowds anytime soon
Ignore dumbass NPCs like this moron.  Its been a bull fiesta.

Ok you retards, let me try to explain this for you. The markets were waiting for congress to agree on the stimulus, they’re not worried about the voting happening tonight or tomorrow morning. Historically this week rips and rallies and with the bank buybacks, vaccine availability, airline funding and stimmy were going to see ATH at least for this week.

If there is stimulus, its small, and commes with restrictions on Fed. And there is a new variant of covid taht is spreading 70% faster and is deadlier for younger people. There are new lockdowns and travel bans. It is not yet known if the vaccines are effective vs. these new strains of covid.

Thanks for the input. Here's some counterarguments:

1. Even in the case that Biden shuts down the US for the month of January, keep in mind that food delivery services typically bring in the least amount of revenue during the winter season because although you may think that people order more food as it's cold outside, historical data shows that the volume of sales tends to decrease, especially in years where the winter is harsh and there's lots of snow.

This winter is supposed to be rather severe, causing roads to be less reliable, thus decreasing the volume of sales as well as the quality (i.e. timeliness of deliveries). Even at the height of the pandemic when lockdowns were introduced, DASH baaarely scrapped by a profit of $29MM for Q2, but quickly returned to operating on a loss in Q3, and this is based off their adjusted EBITDA, which doesn't include \~$100+million in legal and accounting fees from the quarter.

2). My argument isn't primarily based on the fact that they are not profitable. A stronger argument is that they operate in an industry that has no future of being profitable, and no clear path to profitability as the margins are incredibly low and the competition is rampant, particularly due to the low barrier of entry.

Again, I appreciate the input though, and thank you for wishing me tendies!

I don’t think it would persist. Maybe could drag to Jan 15 because of tax payments due, but that should be mild because actual profits are down. If Vix spikes a lot and price down you may want to monetize those and re enter later.
“Position, 1200 shares”.
nice

Theta gang is no ones friend. Those are the real fuckers who should starve.
No aid for state governments is really going to drag out the recovery, and $600 isn't going to stimulate shit.
Thanks for the DD. I got in on your original post before the 10% jump. Have been adding to it with various expirations, and will probably continue to add. https://i.imgur.com/ucep4FU.png

What do you think about VALE's recent work accident? Feels like the company is a magnet for bad news. You think it's time to get out or time to buy more? https://finance.yahoo.com/news/landslide-vale-mine-near-2019-031511533.html

Ehhh, Schwab lets you sell nakeds but you need a 25k account minimum. Most brokerages are similar and Robinhood doesn't even allow naked options last I checked (only cash secured puts). To my knowledge, Tastyworks has the lowest maintenance requirements on naked options right now.

If you want to sell calls but can't deal with the maintenance requirements, you could go with a very wide call spread for similar results. Schwab makes you speak with a rep to prove you're not a moron before you can do credit spreads. Robinhood and Tastyworks don't care.
nah, started in 2020 so like covid19 which started in 2019 this new one should be called Covid20.

😂 anyone surprised by the voting delay doesn’t know about American politics. There isn’t enough time for every politician to bitch about why the bill sucks while they ultimately have to vote for it because it’s good for the “people.” Also, politicians don’t trade weekend dow so got to wait until futures open to see if they can buy the dip

Exactly why we're all banking on a Cohen Takeover. He beat Bezos w/ online dog food, if he gets control he'll do it again w/ PC/gaming industry. Regardless, they're going to have good Q4 so we're also banking on that. If no Cohen Takeover by then or June for shareholder meeting, I think most will be out.

Just invest in stuff that is financially stable yet isn't at ATHs. Consumer staples like GIS, K, KR, CPB have all taken a dip these last two weeks even though financially they're doing perfectly fine.
So far it seems is just easier to spread (same thing happen with the mutation of the summer); however, there is also some prelim data showing that it leads to higher hospitalization rate on younger people which is concerning as that demographic was thought to be a kind of shield. My guess is they need a couple of days to confirm/refute findings so as super precaution they are locking down hard
How am I poor? You accused me of being a pumper so I revealed to you that I don’t own any. Then you rubbed a few brain cells together and surmised that I’m therefore a poor. I’m trying to figure out why you have actual hatred for ipob. I think you’re a real estate agent.

What is this jack ma news and when did it hit
For sure, the early gains are legit. I was absolutely referring to all the recent "short squeeze" idiocy. And that shit was being pumped by a collective in my opinion. I know my fellow autists and retards in here, and that GME short squeeze pump campaign was conducted by some very aggressive outsiders. And then suddenly their pump involved shitting on PLTR after that guy with the awesome PLTR spinning hamster meme let us all know he was hit up by a group of idiots who said they are organized pump n dumpers, asking him to join? I think after he turned them down and exposed them for us, they targeted the PLTR rocket in retaliation. Any of the PLTR passengers should easily remember OverpricedButthole jumping into every single PLTR thread and shitting on the play, then followed by one or two "yes men" responses. These idiots worked very hard and created this short squeeze campaign, a bunch of poor retards bought in while the dipshits probably sold, and now a bunch of GME bagholders are waking up to shaved heads and clipped nuts, asking how the fuck they got here. I'll take the downvotes, it's better than what they're having.
no it isn't

Tesla definitely made a lot of millionaires this year.
well don't do that, if we suffer we suffer together; society may collapse but I wouldn't lose faith in humanity that easily..
I had some at 45$ and sold at 52 so I think you might be right. Reason I sold though is because of the reinstated lockdown that a lot of major cities are doing again...since restaurants have a pretty good sized impact on their sales I was okay with letting it go based on that outlook. Could regret it but w/e I made a little bit of money.

Lmao get that gay vegan shit out of here, it’s ass. We’re already investing in those things but they won’t realistically feed the world for another couple decades, probably longer. Not a solution.
It's not. I made 220k in 3 weeks and over the next few lost it all. Thats it. Thats the tea. Although... fuck it if anyone recognizes me from this... I got a job in Malaysia and as the crash was happening I watched my account go up over 100k while partying on a 64th floor bar and then a week later I came back to the US, quit my job, and went back to grad school. Im poor again now.

There is currently no suggestion that it is more deadly or causes more sever symptoms from every reliable source. 
There isn’t a single bit of evidence to suggest it’s more dangerous for young people. 

The reason why they are taking it seriously and locking shit down is because it’s more CONTAGIOUS. This increases the R number which is the rate of spread, so assuming it’s just as dangerous - it might be less, it means more people get it in a shorter period of time and causes more strain on healthcare services. 

It’s bad news all round. But it’s not what you think.

Grub $6.6B Market Cap / 20% Market Share = $33B Market Size.

$33B Market Size * 50% Dash’s Market Share = $17B True Market Cap

$17B True Market Cap / $53B Current Market Cap * $160 Share Price = $51.32 True Share Price

I agree with your analysis. 

Two cautions: 

1. It’s likely Biden shuts down the US again for a month beginning in January. Door dash will spike on this news. Your options expiry is too early in my opinion. 

2. We all know that stock prices on recognizable brands are seldom tied to the profitability of a company. See Zoom, TSLA, NKLA. Door dash has this strong brand that will prop it up. 

Honestly I can see doordash expanding to shopping outside of just restaurants. Groceries, reasonable sized goods from target etc. Lots of opportunity for growth. I agree with you completely they are ran poorly from an accounting perspective. I just don’t know if it’s the home run you are expecting. Not by January at least. Good luck on your dice roll though.

Bro that was 100 years ago.
Corbus announced in September that it signed a licensing deal with Jenrin Discovery for exclusive rights to develop and market drugs based on 600 compounds that target the endocannabinoid system. The most promising of these drug candidates is CRB-4001, which Corbus hopes can be used to target diseases with organ-specific fibrosis.

Of the remaining drugs in the Jenrin pipeline, Corbus expects to advance one or two new drug candidates per year into clinical testing, starting in 2020.

Yeah I’ve been on the brink of just blowing my head off so I don’t have to live through the inevitable suffering that will be coming in the next couple years.
If you Bulls want it to moon tomorrow, better start spamming whoever is your representative is begging  them to pass the Stimmy. I suggest crying and using the word "Pleas" as often as possible
lol he didn't downgrad the stock to sell when it was $41. It was at outperform before and then the downgraded it to market perform which to means that he expects revenues to be at market expectations. plus that $41 projection really is his target for 12 months out. watch pumpers pump it to $30 and all the shorters come back because the valuation is still to much at this stage. one year out with proven revenue and a dramatic increase in revenue, I would say that this may be $41 but I honestly wouldn't pay $20 for this right now as VLDR trades at 19 and in comparison  has 5x the revenue and lower loss than Lazr. 

if you want to beat on lidar better to go with VLDR at this point cause of their proven track record generating revenue and they also have acquired contracts this quarter as well as patents. disclaimer I dont have positions on this. I did have puts against LAZR when if hit 47 but closed them last week. I see more downside on lazr before they are able to achieve that upside. Also keep lock up periods in mind cause after lock up periods end a lot of of people will dump shares. I can see this pumping a bit but shorters wil come running back to short it again because it had great volatility and is easy money because of that. Also there are alot of bag holders that will dump shares when it hits their average price. 

lidar in other types of technology seems interesting to me but not feasible with cars. Apple has been working on their self driving cars since the early 2000s, they haven't had success so far. Elon also has publicly stated that lidar companies are pretty much doomed if they concentrate on jsmust lidar tech in cars because it is too expensive. There are competitors who offer lidar at a much cheaper value than lazr. 


good luck on your positions though if you have bought in or are planning to. Its a good swing trade at the moment. play both sides and you can make money of the volatility.
Booo
Ice is back
That's the right move but you won't be able to buy anything with $100. I get that $100 is too low to invest in stocks but what the fuck kinds of options are you buying with that?
With all the bad news coming out, I lowered my limit buy prices and raised my limit sell prices on my puts. I canceled my market buys. And I canceled my call buys.

Quote from literally the first link you posted "Will the vaccines work against the new variant?

Almost certainly yes, or at least for now.

All three leading vaccines develop an immune response against the existing spike, which is why the question comes up.

Vaccines train the immune system to attack several different parts of the virus, so even though part of the spike has mutated, the vaccines should still work.

"But if we let it add more mutations, then you start worrying," said Prof Gupta.

"This virus is potentially on a pathway for vaccine escape, it has taken the first couple of steps towards that."

Vaccine escape happens when the virus changes so it dodges the full effect of the vaccine and continues to infect people.

We suddenly care about it because globally we're close to record high daily cases and this new strain might spread 70% faster than the current ones. 

This could be an absolute blowout of the worst kind if it gets out of control. Already have exponential growth, now throw another 70% on that growth rate plus more socializing with the holidays (Christmas is a worldwide thing while Thanksgiving was a US-only thing) and we're fucked.
We do about 10x more in sales just through ubereats, they have a far better feedback system as well. I would gamble on doordash being worth very little in a year. Put prices seem to reflect that

I've linked to the Kent newspaper that publishes the death tally for their counties.  As you can see it's much higher than other counties. 

And yes, you can rebut that Kent county has a higher population, which can lead to a higher count.  I will concede that point.  But as far as I know the other counties are comparable in population.

Actually, it's indeterminate whether the mdoerna and pfizer vaccine will work with this strain, since it has 17-20 changes to the protein spikes in its corona.

This has been reported many times.  But I'm sure they are testing the vaccine against this strain as we speak. more news pending.

But in that scenario, culpability resides with the producer. You just make sure the contract is very specific in what types of content is allowed and invest in moderators that can respond quickly and effectively to complaints. You may have to deal with some PR issues but nothing a halfway decent social team couldn’t handle. Legally as long as your terms are solid and you enforce them effectively, I don’t think there’s much of an issue.

People thought $10 oil wasn’t in the cards either and it went like -$40 when things started spiraling out of control.

There are more than enough calories produced without meat to feed the world. Remember animals only give 1 calorie back in 200+ calories they consume. It’s inefficient. 

Since everyone then argues you need meat how about this idea: instead of investing in animal agriculture (government subsidies), why don’t we just subsidize lab meat?  Then we can all be happy

Thank u steel daddy
This is Chinese posturing. They do this from time to time in an effort to manipulate iron ore prices.  They are bent over the barrel right now for supply of iron ore. You also have to be cognizant of the fact that drops in input costs will increase profitability on orders already contracted through May. Mills will put lower input costs into their pocket and increase gross margin based off sold material already booked. I do think iron ore has been speculatively over heated.  It is due for a bit of a pull back, but there are other derivatives that can be used for steel making like shredded scrap. China planned for this iron ore supply and price issue and changed their stance on importing shredded scrap in October/November. They haven’t imported foreign scrap for years. A signal that they knew this was coming. That’s why I don’t bet on pure iron ore plays.

As far as I know the vaccine still work but they'll still keep an eye on it in case it mutant again to something deadly. As of right now the new mutant virus have 70% infection than the "normal one" and it's pretty much the same virus.

I bought 35k of  105p 08/21 when they opened options and another 15k when it spiked a bit the next day.  Friday was rough - looked great at open then got our faces ripped off but IV jumped a lot too so I ended up barely down at all.  

Hoping that DASH being such a shit company, and also one that is very salient to retail investors, should help bury this thing.  No one has any fucking clue what Palantir does but we all know DASH overcharges you like a mother fucker to bring you cold food.  They screw over their drivers, the restaurants, and the customer.  Their valuation is retarded, especially when compared to a company like Uber that does other things besides food delivery.
So they used the vaccine to inject this mutated virus into UK people. Cool.

There is a new variant (nothing new) and it’s the dominant strain in the london and south east England region, and it’s thought to be about 70% more contagious than the previous strain.

But everything else about this post is complete bullshit. 

It’s not believed to be more deadly towards any particular groups. It’s not caused higher fatality in the region. 

Europe is taking it very seriously however, and many countries have banned flights from the U.K.

You have to be completely brain dead to think DD is worth a fucking thing. They are the worst of the gig economy delivery cos and the whole market is racing to zero. They will literally be bankrupt in 3-5 yrs.
Something about this new strain bs seems fishy. Countries are again banning flights from certain others, parts of the US and most of Europe are back to strict lockdowns. Getting March vibes
Why are we taking perma bull and perma bear positions again? Need to be flexible in this market, like your wife is when she’s in bed with her boyfriend.

My thinking exactly. And with bank buybacks now allowed, what's to stop firms such as Goldman and J.P. from selling a portion of their stakes in DASH when it's clearly been trending down since IPO, when they can liquidate DASH and buy back their own shares?
so.... what is the actual status on stimi?

Made a blanket statement predicting why he was drinking, stating that "people normally get drunk when they are celebrating something."

You're saying then not because it's based in reality but through your personal experiences. 

And someone who used to sell and produce alcohol professionally. I just do not believe that celebration is the majority of the reason that people buy or consume alcohol to the point of intoxication. 

I bet you if you found a thousand random people that got drunk yesterday, less than 10% of them got to drunk to celebrate something.

I know that it is way less than 50%, probably less than 25%, and my bet would be 10% -15%

My move would differ based on the broker and my cash holdings available. If I had anyone except robinhood and I had the funds, I would exercise the shares early premarket/7:30am et and sell it on the spot, then wait for eod to buy up 100 shares and sell it the next day and never look at the stock again. If you’re on robinhood, I’d consider looking at the Greeks, especially gamma and IV. You can’t exercise premarket or aftermarket on robinhood and robinhood has an exercise lag so it’s best to just sell out instead of playing the exercise and praying it goes up for 24 hours.

I bought leaps for March at open Friday morning. Lucky timing. Sold 2/5 of the position and 💎✋ the rest!!
The wheel is a process of selling weekly otm cash covered puts and pocketing the premium. If it doesn’t assign do it again the next week. If it does assign then next week use those shares to sell otm covered calls. Again if it doesn’t assign do it again next week, if it does you also make the difference in the 2 strike prices and go back to the beginning selling cash covered puts. Repeat until rich. Sure it’s slower than YOLOing your college tuition on calls, but it’s safe and steady. You can easily make 2% or more per week with fairly low risk, more if you chase premium on potentially riskier stock.

If it falls,  I’ll have cash to buy back in.  I’ll admit I don’t know whether it will rip or not, but personally I’m too long on stock and too light  cash.  I’m just preparing.

That is actually a huge loophole that could really send this crashing down ultra fast. Put holders will have to hold strong. I assume there will be some attempts to keep it propped up by smaller, but still substantial holders in the near term.

Take a look at Anthem, Centene, and the other insurers. The valuation gap is even more significant. 

TSLA is a whole different animal. It's share price is high due to the meme factor and the novelty of owning TSLA (like how people own shares in the Green Bay Packers even though they are worthless).

It's kinda sad you're getting downvoted, because at least the part about this being utterly fucking brain damaged "iNfiNITy SquEEZe!" is right.

Having been in (and out, and back in again) GME since the March selloff, it was maddening to see GME come to WSB in this way.

Because, there was a shit ton of tendies to be made in GME (and there still is), but the fucktards who pumped this squeeze narrative really ruined it for a shit ton of people who would be making money already if they hadn't followed this retarded narrative.  Just the other day, one of them posted a capitulation rant about how GME was a shit company and he was selling all his shares (in the $12s, at a big loss).  I commented that was the post marking the bottom again, and it was time to load up.  It went to $14, quickly.

I got an easy double in GME from $2.72 to having it all called away on $5.50 covereds back in May, then re-upped with an average price of $4.24, and now have a negative adjusted basis just from selling covered calls to these asshats.

And all these clowns will eventually probably just throw in the towel over the next few weeks because they're all still underwater on $18 shares, and then we'll never hear about GME any more and it'll go to $30 by the end of 2021.
What are some good spacs to invest in? Vtiq was one of my favs

pltr opening at 50 tomorrow
My logic is that it's reasonably far out of the money so the premiums are far lower than if you were to buy, for example, 150p. I also think that 120 is VERY likely to be broken in the upcoming weeks, and although I think DASH easily goes to $75 or below within half a year, It's a bit risky for me to buy at a strike that low as I'm literally allocating my entire portfolio to this play.

Hmm what if it’s all priced in, would the market even move, what even changes the price? Is the market real? Are we real? Is this all a simulation?
I am not as familiar with options on robinhood than with other brokerages but normally you would “sell to close” a call. Because there’s also something called selling calls which is basically the opposite as buying a call except you have limited profit and unlimited loss. I think with Robinhood tho you would just click on the call that you own and hit sell to get rid of it. You can either do a market sell or a limit sell. I always do a limit sell that way I’m not losing out on any expected profits. There is a difference b/w the bid price and ask price for a call so you pay a little more for a call than what you would immediately get back to resell it. So it has to go up a little bit more than what you bought it for for you to break even.

Your life, your rules. My life, my rules. Others might think you having 8 million is too much or that what you plan to give is not enough and  to think otherwise is also greedy according to them. I'd rather be greedy and pursue $80MM, or even $800MM because the giving would scale along with it. I could get more with dividends/interest and further expand giving/supporting local causes.  🤷‍♂️ To each their own.

What they don’t realize is these sad pieces of shit are just desperately searching for *any* possible scenario where their positions print, or where they can take one position and finally climb out of a hole. 

I’ve seen it in real life, fucking degenerates watching the game and talking about “oh if there’s an interception and then we get a TD and a field goal and stop them for the rest of the game i can still beat the spread!” 

Fuckin trash.
Martin Luther King Jr. died for this.
Lol. I wish. 10,000 shares. Bought in at $23. Total cash value $230,000

Hey friends, 

I went to pawn some gold yesterday and the guy recommended I keep it cause gold I supposed to go parabolic apparently.

If this is true how does one bet on this?

Should I just buy gold and hoard or what plays can I yolo ?

Ty
LoL they failed 2 stage 3 trials on their ONLY drug... Their remaining trial is for the same drug. Gonna fail again. Plus they are out of cash and had to cut 30% of their research staff. Yeah it’s definitely due for a comeback 🙄
I sold what I had at break even and I don't think the reward for holding would be worth the risk. Weeklies iv was so fucked it's going to need major movement to profit

Steel prices will be controlled by China. [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-19/china-steel-group-executive-expects-decline-in-iron-ore-price](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-12-19/china-steel-group-executive-expects-decline-in-iron-ore-price)
That process (inspection, financing, etc) is not eliminated when you sell with OpenDoor. Either the cost in priced in the home offering (in that case there is no benefit of why I would like to use OpenDoor as a customer) or if OpenDoor pays for that, then how it makes a profit?


Also I don’t think OpenDoor can buy a home and be able to sell it immediately. I would love to see how long on average it takes for them to sell a home (aka. how much risk they assume per sale).


Also pricing a home is very difficult. If their margin for each sale is 5-6%, it means their margin for error needs to be < 5-6%. This may be doable for condominium or new development where all houses look the same, but I doubt they can expand more than that.


Re real estate market: real estate market crashed in 2007. I don’t think Opendoor could have survive that. Even if it doesn’t happen now or in the near future, it is hard to get long term investors to buy into that, which would affect the price.
If you're a bear and you always on about how the market is rigged and manipulation and yadda yadda, why do you buy puts? If it is really truly rigged like that then why fight it? Is the allure of getting to say I told you so and finally make 12 dollars that good.

>I sent this reply to another guy that was curious about the lockup; "That's true, but keep in mind that while there is a 180 day lockup period for the majority of the underwriters of the DASH IPO, the 2 main underwriters that represent the rest of them are Goldman Sachs and J.P. Morgan, BOTH of which are exempt from the lockup period and are free to dump their shares at discretion."
Nope. Even Nancy is in on the Flim Flam.
You act like covid itself is what caused the crash. No it was the literal changing of how we all do business and lockdowns/extreme lifestyle changes. We are all used to it and have adjusted as a society. New "strain" isn't gonna do shit.
Ha, million dollar trader with Anton Kriel.  I watched the whole thing.  It wasnt all that enthralling or anything, but I didnt mind because it was while I was studying for an actuarial exam so i just needed something to unwind with at the end of the day.  I dont really know British tv, but I kinda liked the less formal feel than with american reality shows.  It felt a bit more genuine or something.

Got that new COVID-20 direct from the EU.
We said fuck it before the original shutdown right up until we said "eh maybe we should care".  Also remember big money got put on notice first so don't hold bags!
No that’s strategically prudent.  You’ve had a huge gain if you’ve held since February.  Taxes wil be a big difference for you.   I’m trading in an it’s so I don’t have to worry about taxes for many years still.
Your calls have never looked better my friend
Yup. And I didn't sell them on Friday.

Frankly the marketing would be the easiest part. If you could build a site that is easy for creators to upload to and use, does all the necessary segmentation between paid and unpaid profiles (I think one login for all would be necessary - don’t want to make it hard for users to switch between profiles), and is able to effectively consolidate content into a singular feed that we could infuse “remarketing” ads for other creators into, I could market the absolute shit out of it.

Especially if it only costs like 1k per month for unlimited bandwidth, that opens up all sorts of possibilities with your pricing structure that you could use to create a model OF couldn’t compete with. All of a sudden you’ve got a better mousetrap for creators and nothing standing between them and your site.

Very seriously if you think this is doable, I’m down to go in on a venture here.
yes
I’m also onboard the short squeeze train but some of yall are getting blinded by the hopium. Market cap means nothing in valuations. 

It’s a loss making company. It will take more than 2 years for it to get to that kind of valuation. Looking at AMD as a turnaround example - they had Lisa Su at the helm for what, 2 years before the share price exploded to 80? And you are looking at 500. 

20c 6/2021 maybe for the short squeeze/cohen takeover play but anything further out than that is you projecting your early retirement fantasies bruv

What is your take on the BABA news?   
[https://www.wsj.com/articles/jack-ma-makes-ant-offer-to-placate-chinese-regulators-11608479629?st=uk5bbav1fs9tusu&reflink=article\_copyURL\_share](https://www.wsj.com/articles/jack-ma-makes-ant-offer-to-placate-chinese-regulators-11608479629?st=uk5bbav1fs9tusu&reflink=article_copyURL_share)  


Sounds bullish to me, but what do I know, I am just a retard with a lot of BABA shares 🚀
Correct. In an extreme scenario, the prices goes down so much that no one will think it will reach the short leg ($45) so the price of the option you sold becomes 0 which means you can keep all of the premium.
What happened since March to the stonks tho?
Yes, but there's no need to exercise a put. When DASH tanks, the values of the puts are going to increase dramatically, as delta increases (rate of change of price of the put with respect to a $1 change in the underlying.) 

In dummy terms, the premium is higher for the same strike contract if it's further dated because you're given more time for the contract to land in the money. Even if the put is not in the money, the value increases as the underlying goes down. I strongly recommend watching a few videos by "project option" on youtube, he's got some great educational content
BeRs feeling good with this mutation.  Little do they know it’s priced in.

imagine missing out on this
The sad part is it seems like you have no drive or goal in life besides to retire on 60k. That seems depressing as fuck. Out of curiosity do you suffer from or takes medication for depression?
Technically, you always keep the full premium. The only difference is whether or not you're forced to sell your shares (if you sold a covered call) or if you're forced to buy 100 shares (if you sold a put).
Mutated Covid Virus says: Fukk your Vaccines.
I was able to read the original posting... you say when the price goes down, the 45c can cover some of the loss from the 30c. Are you saying the premium you gain from selling the 45c is what covers some loss?
Gotta say, with brexit talks not finished and now the new covid strain, UK has been kinda a dick to my calls 🇬🇧😳

Yeah, I don’t necessarily mean sell spreads to take advantage of the IV but rather to just avoid it while taking a bearish position
Quite possible, but I also think that stimulus is quite priced in.  Any further stalling may just shake the markets.  For my risk/ reward I figured I’d cash a bit in. So that I can be flexible if I need to pivot.

Alright alright I’m retired and new to buying puts. I completely agree with you. I’m looking at the June 120 strike price put but  it’s twice the price of the February monthly 120 put.

Going to a store is so 2019.
So what’s pltr gonna be looking like tomorrow gang
Exactly. I don’t see any company which could be in a bubble, apart from Tesla. But the fact is that Tesla is an actual disruptive company, not just “disruptive” like Netflix has been with Blockbuster, or Apple with Nokia, Tesla has an absolutely different idea on how the next 20 years should be and producing electric cars is just the starting point. I mean Elon Musk has literally the plan to go to Mars someday, he’s not just working hard with the plan of producing good cars.

Another important thing, is that history doesn’t repeat itself. You can’t just look at a past event and think it’s gonna happen again. Every history enthusiast knows that

Freemont delivers vehicles to certain locations at certain times of the quarter. It's the big downside of Tesla only having 1 1/2 factories. They don't have localized production so they have to deliver like this. But yeah, basically this is around the time that side of the country gets their deliveries. Regardless, I am very confident that Tesla is going to deliver over 180k cars this quarter.

Had been selling puts on Corbus Pharmaceuticals (using money my wife and I made from selling our condo) when it tanked 80% after hours (and I got assigned on 41,000 shares). Then a few weeks later it tanked another 40%.

High of $10.75 in early September, to low of $0.75 in October. Felt like Joe Exotic, "I will never financially recover from this".

It's been a slow and steady road to recovery, overall I'm only down about $60k now after selling covered calls and the stock has recovered into the mid $1's. Never again.
To add, some expert sources indicate Tesla will be between 500 and 800.

I can see my lost package. Usps can’t find it though.
Interesting, I also think we go up or down.
Available float isn't subjective.  Shares are either available to sell, or they aren't.

There's no conceivable case to be made that only 10% of GME is "available to sell".  It's so far from reality as to be laughable.

Also, if you bothered to look at any of my comments, you'd know I have roughly $625,000 long in GME.

AAPL closing more stores - is that priced in?
No joke, I just drove to Phoenix from Dallas and back, twice. Coming back from Phoenix on I-10, both times, I saw several semi trucks carrying 8-10 Model 3s on each truck. Thought that was a good sign about TSLA.

Thanks! Yeah I’m definitely still bullish, but September and October didn’t go so well for me so it felt very good to secure a win. I sold to cover cost basis with some additional profit, and look forward to seeing how this stock moves over the next couple months. 

Best of luck and look forward to seeing some gain porn from you if this stock moves the way we think it will!
I don't have a short positon on ABNB, nor do I have puts. However, I do think that they are overvalued and can't sustain their market cap. I'm all in on DASH shorts and puts right now. I've done far more DD on DASH than ABNB, and believe the bearish arguments for DASH are more convincing.

Is that like a cum box?
I agree.  It was just a general comparison on the technicals of the chart.  While the companies are completely overvalued the companies themselves have actual products with real earnings.  Very different.
It's not a 400% premium.

Any type of metric is a comparison to another company.

However all companies  are different.

For example, Tesla is growing at a certain rate while Toyota is growing at another. So the price to sales you would see is probably quite different. You can argue whethrr Tesla's price to sales is reasonable enough give it's specific situation, but you cannot really compare it in any meaningful way to Toyota because they are a such different lifecycles in. Their business.

You essentially have to do some sort of cashflow or profitability and revenue forecast for the future. Price to sales is not really going to work as well.

A cure has been found for the new UK strain of C-19 that has mutated! It’s still in testing phase and we’re looking for volunteers willing to be test subjects and possibly be the first inoculated.

The test is not very invasive, but does require sperm to be shot directly onto the face and into the eyes. Side effects so far are a slight burning sensation, clouded vision and in one case permanent blindness. This case is considered to be a one off due to the closeness of the blast. We are recommending subjects be back at least 6” from ejection site to avoid repeat occurrences.

As always, contact your local Wendy’s for further details.
If you are using Robinhood there is a good chance you are the idiot. Don't worry, almost everyone on WSB does, which should tell you something.

Welcome aboard brother.
I cant wait to buy $600 worth of Reddit awards with my stimulus check. I cant think of anything more retarded than that.
Jesus christ shut the fuck up already. This fearmongering is getting ridiculous. This is a different *strain* of the same virus. The vaccines will still be effective this just means there are minor characteristics that may be different for example this strain might spread faster. 

Someone put it like this: The original strain and this strain is like the difference between a pitbull and poodle. They're both dogs just different types.

Also there's been 4000 different strains so far, and we've known this all year.
Are you 1 of those super rich Chinese foreign exchange students whose parents pay over 100k a year for them to study in a US college and drive around in an Audi R8?

Thank you for the solid explanation!
It’s so the company makes more money. They don’t give a fuck about the jobs or workers.
Doesn't matter what price RH shows you, they are going to get you the worst possible price at any given moment. They charge like twice per user for their order flow as other brokers. Can you guess why they can do that?
Agreed. There's a clear reason that amazon hasn't disrupted and completely monopolized the food delivery business, which they easily have the resources to do. It's because the profit margins are shit, and the business model isn't profitable in the short OR long term. When DASH executives were asked about how they would turn into a profitable company, they simply cited that they would increase volume, which is contradictory as they lose money on every delivery

It does makes sense from a purely "actual worth" point of view, if PLTR had a standard, "get MM rich first" IPO, it would have IPOed well in the $60 range; that being said i still think that anything more than 35$ before February would be some sort of miracle, one i actually am praying for (holding Jan 15 $35 and $40 calls)!

Smoking is terrible for peripheral arterial disease.  Leads to ischemic limbs due to lack of blood flow which equals gangrene.  Also high correlation with high blood pressure which damages renal function and leads to dialysis.  Worst case is poorly controlled obese diabetic who smokes.

two years, maybe. Apple will likely have an M-family offering for every type of computer in their lineup by this time next year.

Yeah, the standard lockup period for the minor underwriters is 180 days. HOWEVER, the two main underwriters represent the rest of the minor underwriters in the IPO, and the 2 big players are Goldman and J.P. Morgan, whom have the largest stakes of the firms involved. According to the SEC filing in which DASH applied for an IPO, it is stated that the lockup period does NOT apply to Goldman and J.P., thus granting them the right to sell any number of shares at any time to their discretion.

Flu Brittanica is nothing to worry about. If anything it means more stimmy and possibly more vaccine tendies long-term.
If you don't feel comfortable with Jan/Feb puts, you could always opt for something along the lines of may or even further out. Not saying that call credit spreads are a bad play at all though, as it's still bearish on DASH.
Then you get assigned in the week TSLA crashes 30% and your cost basis is way above the stock price lol. Yeah you can wheel but it'll be a long time bag holding selling calls. Just go out further for more premium. 30-45 days.

I just think left pushing taxes for the rich is a red herring. The US government expenditure in 2019 was 7.6 trillion dollars. (Bound to be more in 2020 brrrrr) If you confiscated 100% of the top 25 richest Americans net worth it would total approx. 1.6 trillion. Not to mention the economic effect that would have. 

At the end of the day, I see the state as the root cause or perpetrator of most if not all modern ills, and you don’t. Philosophically I think government is immoral and in a utilitarian sense, I just don’t see government as the best solution for our problems.

Vaccines don't grant blanket immunity.  Even if you been vaccinated against measles for example, you can still get it if you are exposed to a massive dose (from an unvaccinated person with a fulminant infection for example).  Vaccines help with herd immunity massively reducing transmission, also if you are exposed to a massive dose it makes your illness less risky because your immune system has been primed to fight the virus.
Lmfaoooo. Us bulls GREATLY appreciate your liquidity
Lol TDA is a slightly more complicated RH. Another cool feature I’m not sure if you know about is you can add specific options to your watchlist. If you want to see how SPY 12/31 380C is doing you can simply add it and enter whenever you feel like it’s a good opportunity. Just go to the option and click the + under the trade button and add it to the list you want to see.

I’m balls deep my guy lol. I think we’re gonna run up all the way until earnings, maybe shave 15% after lockup, then blue skies from there.
Is there such a thing as true love? I bet Bezos could steal 90% or more of people's "soulmates" with a few mil.

The US would be significantly better off if everyone who's smart and has a little bit of money had a lot of kids. Instead it's the complete idiots on welfare who have kids, leading to the overall average IQ to be below average. 

China is going to eat the world alive, mostly because they have a large population of people who have above average IQ.
I heard they made new ones and even though they sjw’d it up it was still funny . Rocko’s modern life still the best tho
Our government is so kind and caring for us.  Waits till the very last minute to finally pass something and gives us $600 which should last us for at least 5 months.  God bless this country

Let’s see who’s right ;) I just got one random lotto put
I see it like this, I can always go back to healthcare. I was one of the fastest growing offices in one of the biggest US cities right out of graduation. I don't see any reason why I couldn't do it again, and do it better a second time.

However, what I do see is an increase in frequency of global pandemics and other terrible bullshit. I have no confidence that future lawmakers will do anything better. The fact that admin and politicians are getting pushed to the front of the vaccine line over docs and nurses is atrocious. Hospitals have been fucking over staff since the beginning. This is why I never worked for one.

To be clear, I did sports injuries. I'm not helpful during a pandemic and pandemics aren't helpful for me.

That's true, but keep in mind that while there is a 180 day lockup period for the majority of the underwriters of the DASH IPO, the 2 main underwriters that represent the rest of them are Goldman Sachs and J.P.

Lmao Thor node holder? Hahah love the name
Hahah. How the fuck did you lose that much THIS YEAR!?
1.	Yeah sure, “liquid” try to withdraw 1B from any bank and see how liquid it is.

Good lord, I have to split withdrawals because most ATMs won’t give you more than a few thousands.

2.	If you are the 2nd richest man in the world and withdrew your net worth from a bank, you’ll probably force that bank into bankruptcy.

3.	there’s really not much difference between stocks and money, they both come from big entities that can print more when they please and their value is given by supply and demand. The obvious difference is that you are measuring your stock value in $, but you could as well measure your dollars in Tesla stock.
Either you win or lose, 50/50 chance
Part of their reasoning is they don’t want to fund what they call “Democrats cronyism” because the money directly goes to the people and not corps.
“Caucus expected around 5 pm per sources. Does that mean text finished by then?

OTM. Out of the money. If you sell call options, on the expiry date, if the strike price of the option you sold is higher than the price of the share ticker, you are OTM and keep all your premiums. If you sell put options and your strike is below the ticker price at expiry, you also keep all the premium. No dumb questions here homie. I discovered options 10 months ago and still learning from all the OGs on this subreddit.

Alright it isn't greedy, and it isn't a bad life. For you.  Others want a more luxurious life than that. Nothing wrong with either view.

Sick of hearing the comparisons between now and 1999. I was alive in 1999 and the internet had to be dialed up in most cases. Amazon only sold books and average person who knew what a computer was only needed a disc of 50 free AOL hours to do what they needed to do online which was basically nothing (okay, maybe they ordered flowers or talked to their friends in Japan). Today the internet is life itself. Tech is everything and will never pop. 
If you need technicals I will fire off some paperwork with my dotmatrix printer (give me 3 hours) and fax them to you.
Hold on Man, I’ve got 100k on this
What will TSLA open tomorrow in your opinion?
sounds like an accourate description of this circle-jerking sub
Wonder if the US knew about the mutating strain and rushed to pass a relief bill before media picked up on it. Now if it gets worse they can refer citizens to the lighter relief bill they just passed rather than a bigger one that’s needed since this strain could be worse.

I remember talking to you in some threads about OpenDoor!! I sold half of my calls early last week for almost 300% gain. Gonna ride these May $25c and buy more if they drop this week.
Except my number isn't greedy as it would be enough to live off the interest and live the life I want if I was making 60k a year. Thats reasonable. The guy who has 8mil clearly wants way more than that.

With herd immunity, the vast majority of a population are vaccinated, lowering the overall amount of virus able to spread in the whole population. As a result, not every single person needs to be vaccinated to be protected, which helps ensure vulnerable groups who cannot get vaccinated are kept safe.

I believe in the agent free model (what Redfin is trying to do - that too can provide 6-7% saving). OpenDoor vs Redfin is like Hotel vs. Airbnb. Why need so much capital while you can be the middleman. Also it wouldn’t work for many part of America with low demand/activities. As a consumer/homeowner, I absolutely love Redfin, and would never use OpenDoor.


Redfin actually scaled down their iBuying bc they wouldn’t scale it until they get the business model proven. That signaled to me that it is a good company, not a company that just chases trend and hype.

America is vastly underpopulated. All those crappy states in the middle are pretty fertile and empty. Probably could support a few hundred more million people.
WTF countries are shutting down travel from Europe as I type this. The new strain is spooking the hell out of some of these countries all of a sudden. They're not even waiting they are legit shutting down everything without giving it a second thought.

Have they fucked it up again
Yes, every fucking day. The gay bears push this narrative but there is absolutely zero reason/catalyst for people to pull all their money at once. New strain of covid? Sure, you'll get sick for a couple weeks, but you won't die. We have a ton of data on that already. Eviction and no stimulus for unemployed? Market doesn't care about low income workers anyways. Middle class and high class are doing just fine. Please tell me why institutions would pull all their money, to stick it where?
Didn’t know shorting stock would be a good short put hedge but makes sense in a way.  layoffs earlier this year plus the tax break i think helped them report an earnings beat this quarter.
I did at the beginning of December happy with it Soo far, might take some profits and buy back into some other things if stocks dip
The market reflects rich people, not poor people. It couldn't care less about poor people.
That’s even more fair 😂😂🥇🥇🥇🥇🥇

The bank can't just hold onto your money if you want to withdraw it. The sum of money in the bank is irrelevant.  If the money isn't there because they loaned it out then sorry for them. Now they have to loan money to repay you. If they do not like those terms they are free to not accept billionaires as customers.

I don't think porn is allowed by the SEC. Jay said something about stocks being for everyone and I think it would be appropriate for any exchange to do that.

Thanks for posting this, I think it’s important to consider.  With these IPOs there could be some kind of financing in the background that needs to have a minimum price on the share, forcing the party who received the financing to support the stock to prevent their loan getting called.  There’s gotta be something like that going on with NKLA.
Everyone gonna put their $600 toward PLTR 🚀🚀🚀

Hell yeah.  Selling puts is free money unless you get assigned.
Just to clarify, while this does look like a weekly bull flag forming, neither declining volume or consolidation are inherently bullish. This is why you wait for the break, retest, and resumption in this sort of situation.

I think naked short Dash calls is actually the best play here (puts have insane IV) but anytime I mention this people are too scared and will talk about infinite loss, so it goes no where. I mean a credit call spread is also another way to do it since I don't think the down move will be fast.

If you have ‘something’ that is caused by ‘something else’, and maybe you don’t know what exactly that ‘something else’ is, maybe within 5-10% of its true value, you can assume a range of ‘something else’s’ and come up with a prediction spread for ‘something’.

‘Something’ here would be PLTR price, ‘something else’ would be maybe something that predicts the price, maybe a moving average. It looks in this post that OP has basically continued the moving average curve. Basically took the scenic route and ended up the same place, TA bs.

The world of Genetics have not been fully realized. their bull run hasn't started. its slowly lifting off.
If you’re assigned after hours is where the issue comes into play. It doesn’t matter whether it’s a call or put because there is so much market volatility in premarket/aftermarket that you could be down on tens of thousands of dollars on spreads based on how bad the day is. Imagine owning the short end of spreads on March 19th.
Some of my sell stops kicked in on the way down. I started buying in May with those proceeds and with new cash I have on the sidelines. Have made the $1,000,000 back, thankfully.

It is also the busiest time of the year. UPS and FedEx drop off packages to USPS to deliver because neither private company has the means to deliver to each and every home across the country, leading to an even further backlog for USPS in a year in which more has been purchased through online shopping than ever before.
This is 100% accurate. Knowing this is unfortunately how I also know how to play the market.

Redfin is a great business though is beholden to working with the agent model like Zillow with the difference of having their own agents in some listings. 

Both Zillow and Redfin are trying to catch up in ibuying - OpenDoor has 60-70% share. 

"Glorified home flipping" not quite accurate. It is providing home owners immediate liquidity without hassle and cost of a listing process (which is more cumbersome and takes longer). OpenDoor's margins are effectively the cost of listing a house and they profit on the difference in being able to do that cheaper than the homeowner (the real estate agent alone costs 5-6% of the sale). Flipping implies they are getting some massive price discount and expecting market prices to rise to make money. That's not the model.

I'm a relatively new retard, 6 months or so here, what does OTM mean? Thanks!!
The DD on front page showed really low premiums for March 21 calls
This story takes place in A.D. 2017. 

It was the worst sales numbers coming from the semiconductor companies since the Dot-com bubble burst in the early 2000s. I, Mr. Mind flayer, had a brain-idea to short the semi sector. It started with just 3K lost inside a few weeks, so I went back to the drawing board and checked my maths. Everything checked out on my end and I told myself let's try this again. Bam! Lost 4K. I checked and recheck the data and the numbers are still miserable. I try again with the same results. 

Fast forward 5 months and semi sector never gave in so after losing $21,631.84 in the span of that time I stopped trading or speculating for 13 months after that ass whooping. 

What I didn't calculate for was the amount of liquidity being pumped and it needed to get somewhere and that was into the market. 

I'll never again be so stubborn to willing stand in front of a freight train.
Okay yeah just lost. Fair and square isn’t the right words you’re right.

Ok dude you got lucky. good for you, but if you can't think of a valid reason why the stock was going to go up and even plan on holding the stocks long term even though it's overvalued like crazy you're not a smart investor and you shouldn't talk like you know what you're doing.

I'll invest in overvalued stocks if i know that they'll make me some money but holding them long term is just retarded.

To be clear, the main risk for ironyman came from selling puts, right? If you stick to buying and selling calls, it's significantly less risky, right? Cause being forced to close your position early isn't as scary since you'll be covered by the call you bought.. assuming you have the money to exercise that other call.
What are some less talked about positions you feel optimistic about?
Made about 220k from 2k in the February/March covid crash. Lost all but my initial investment in the following months.

After the pornhub fiasco, I think in less than a year Reddit starts taking down gonewild and other subreddits unless there is a better age verification system. All it will take is one article from a major news outlet to find a needle in a haystack to make a case that there are a few underage girls on there. With the recent legislation, hosting anonymous amateur porn is too much of a liability to be worth it.

If anyone was wondering Def Jam FFNY is over $200. About a year ago it was $100 but I paid $20 because I sold a bunch of old games I never played and a jacked up Wii that I don’t think it works well to the store for it.
Good, I'm buying the dips
It will go through this time.
I don’t care
GME has a deal w/ MSFT to get a cut of digital revenue. I've never bought a game from MSFT, unless it was on the Xbox store, which GME now gets a cut. Also, there was a SA article or two saying GME probably already has some sort of revenue deal w/ Sony, too. GME get their shit together with their brand recognition, they'll be able to dip their hands into every part of the gaming/PC industry, if they start running like a decent corporation. Like imagine GME logos everywhere on LoL tournaments, and the more popular bigger stores can be used to host mini gaming tournaments. These boomers are retarded to not see that potential over 5 years ago, when they were at their peak. If you don't see the undervaluation in GME, sucks for you to eventually watch GME 🚀🚀🚀 and with their financials they're doing more than fine for being a supposedly bankrupt company in the midst of a pandemic. #WeWantCohen

Have covid. Crazy symptoms like no taste. No breathing issues. Puts on your conspiracy. NIO 50c
TSLA up in Zimbabwe market 🇿🇼
Yes I have. The reason I use them on stocks I have is because it's like a safety net. Never sure where it will peak and I don't want to miss out on gains if it takes off. I set mine at 20% trailing stops.

The logic for this is that if you go too low (like say 5%) it might go off too early in a dip and become more of an annoyance having to re buy all the time or worse, missing  large gains when it goes up after a dip. 20% is the level I am comfortable at because even though it potentially means only 80% of the peak, it also means: I won't sell prematurely, I can comfortably watch the rise, and best of all I should not lose more than 20% of my investment if it tanks.

I am not saying this is something you should do, it just makes the most sense for me so thats what I do.
Same place the stimulus and Tesla's profits are.

Thanks for the insight. To add onto your argument, DASH used to take 20% revenue from restaurants, and recently cities such as Chicago have capped the amount of revenue that these gig companies can take to 15%, which will certainly cause a hit to DASH's revenue. If this legislation spreads to more cities such as NYC, LA, etc, we could see a much more widespread decrease in revenue.
Who here from Europe can buy puts on the ftse100 it’s literally free money tomorrow

But I don’t think Cohen will do anything significant till March, which will be him nominating board members which will be decided on in June or July during the shareholders meeting. I personally don’t think we hit 30’s till April but who knows I could be wrong
If you could average a 96% gain on 100k selling calls and puts, you could just compound that 96% and be worth billions by the time you retire.

JPM has 1T cash on hand 
https://www.google.com/search?q=jp+morgan+cash+on+hand&oq=jp+morgan+cash+&aqs=chrome.1.69i57j0i457j0l3.7123j0j4&client=ms-android-sprint-us-revc&sourceid=chrome-mobile&ie=UTF-8

Banks loan out money yes, but they loan out 10+ times what they have in reserve. So a bank with 1T in deposits can loan out 10T+

If they have 9T loaned out, they can still cash out 100B if needed. Past that, they have to borrow money from the federal reserve or other Banks to have enough on hand for people to withdraw. 

This is automatic, they get physical cash as needed based in unlimited supply to cover the total amount loaned out and on deposit. Though usually cash is not needed for the majority of it.

In aggregate, 1B gets transfered between bank accounts at different banks often. People buy large things, buy lots of stocks, companies, etc. A Company/individual with 10B in deposit might buy a 100M company or stock or transfer 100M to a different bank, or even pay out employees, etc that total that all the time.

You can transfer that billion dollars to other Banks and other accounts and buy things with that billion dollars, transferring it to other people, who can all withdraw money if they want.

The system has a 80 year track record of just working without flaw. It has stability and to suggest that you can't get 1B in value for your 1B deposit is ludacris.
Yeah I do, it’s really helpful. You realize what a dumb fuck you are and it helps you to be one less often.

Just thinking. Aren't the calls more likely to be 'legit' buys (sorry my terminology is shit but I mean buys where they want to earn money as opposed to a put which would offer them insurance if their stock was to lose value) ?
That 600 will help soak up your tears.
Should have been priced in because the flaw was known and patched a while ago. But the market is run by the barely literate (us and a bunch of frat bros) so the drop after the SWI connection brought attention to the flaw makes sense. In the grand scheme of things it's not a massive security hole (if it were the NSA would have kept it to themselves to use against foreigners), but seeing VMWare next to SWI's name in the headlines will scare the shit out of boomer execs in the short term.

Assuming no new news about more VMWare vulnerabilities, puts for the next week or two as the VWware connection makes the rounds in the headlines, then LEAPs or just boomer shares.

Sideways?
The problem with that is your cost to support their site scales with their traffic so if you get someone like Belle Delphine on your site doing millions per month you’re losing a ton of money on hosting alone for her traffic.

In my mind it has to be a percentage of rev but you could probably come in way below the ~~80%~~ 20% currently taken by OF.

Then you have the issue of consolidating content from multiple creators. If you have individual sites per creator ie a subdomain model or something like BellaD.mysite.com how do you aggregate all that together in the feed of a typical customer that subscribes to multiple different creators on the site.

So you have to have something that allows creators to create individual profiles on the same site and have a way to lock profiles that haven’t been paid for. You should also have a passable algorithm to prioritize content in a consolidated feed for those with multiple subscriptions. That part isn’t as much “necessary” but very helpful to the overall UI of the site. And gives you an opportunity to promote other “lookalike” creators natively to users that may be likely to sub to them.

This is actually a really exciting idea lol I think I may actually do this.

Hold strong, Diamond hands until DASH is in the dirt. MMs artificially pumped up the price of DASH on friday. You can tell because the bid-ask spread was well over 50c for several hours of the day. While DASH is certainly lower volume than an underlying like SPY, this does not explain a spread of 50+cents on a STOCK, not even on options.  If MMs buy the stock at the bid, they can pump up the price to squeeze out shorts and paperhanded put holders by setting a very high ask, thus creating a temporary wide spread and causing an influx in the price.

Does this mean that stonks go up?
No I’m just saying that a company that makes up 1% of the s&p can crash without causing the market to plummet. If TSLA went to $0 s&p would only go down 1% if everything else stayed flat. That’s not even taking about the other stocks that will probably moon from the stimmy news. TSLA will crash briefly and s&p will be fine
All in Calls. Stonks only go up.

Actually I disagree. The difference is because of the catalysts that are on the table currently. Ryan Cohen, Shermans strategic reconstruction of GME. The previous console booms were purely based on consoles.

see this is boomer mentality and i entirely disagree, you just have to spend some extra money to find those good sweatpants. you don't have to decide between being comfortable or presentable today, but you can't save money and have both.

You should look up how hard it is to get hired by Palantir. They have some very smart people working for them and have financial backing of Peter Thiel. 

So some MIT grad writes “better AI” than Palantir, where is he getting the money or team to integrate this AI without trouble from Palantir? Does he write all this software around it by himself, and with what money? Does the US just start giving him security clearances? Why doesn’t Palantir just see he’s promising and hire him when they already have everything integrated with the government, or on the other side, make it hard for him to get anywhere. I think you’re being very naive about how this all works, especially with the “MIT grad makes better AI and gets hired” thing, kind of displays how little you know about Palantir and what they do with the government.
Hey man poor people exist.
Meh - most communities have multiple subs.

Outstanding.
Mega call buying all day Friday. WFC 🚀
Wait what’s wrong with that?
Going to print hard
So if this is true (which I believe) I think it should go up in PM being that it’s down from Friday’s close price followed by the inevitable sell off at the bell... hopefully it should rebound by noon and we’ll see what happens from there. No contracts expire tomm so perhaps it could pump for “power hour” instead of dump followed again by the inevitable eod sell off of its pretty well into the green. I’m not gonna fool myself though idk anything about anything but I’ve certainly lost enough money at this point to notice a pattern. But if your going to try to recognize a pattern for a particular stock tsla would probably be the hardest to do it’s so unpredictable. God bless Elon. We shall see what happens

CONFIRMED DOLLAR IS IN BUY ZONE AND WILL FUCK THE >!your mom !<
So in this situation you’ve sold to open the 45c so you’d have to buy it back to close. If PLTR moves to 44 the 45c you sold will have a much higher premium than when you sold it at 26 unless it is about to expire out of the money.
Imo, if those are not weeklies, you'll make money on both sides

Fuck yeah
You sell a call at a strike price (i.e. SPY 450) and buy a call as a hedge against it so youre not just selling a naked call (i.e. buy SPY 500). This gives you a net credit and if both calls expire worthless (SPY never hits 450), you make money. You can also just close the position once you feel you've made enough profit.

Is selling the 45$ contract typically worthless at 44$? or is it effectively the same as letting the 45$ contract expire at 60$?

I realize letting it expire means you're on the hook for 100 shares, but if you sell the contract before that, can you save some money?
I thought I explained it in the most basic form possible.      

1) you can’t exercise options premarket or aftermarket.       

2) not paying attention to and working the bid/ask spread is how you drive up IV by yourself which will cause you to lose all of your invested money within 10 minutes. If the bid/ask spread is .05-2.40 and you buy for anywhere close to mid you might belong on the short bus, and I do not mean that in an adoring way.

From India, American higher education isn’t what I call being educated. Anyone can go to college, institutions just slap 100K on random degrees to make you think you’re smart while justifying the price. Schooling here was an actual joke compared to home but it is romanticized for some reason.
Govt contracts are typically valued at 1 base year with 4 optional years. The 100mil value you gave it could be spread over 5 years. Source: I work with govt contracts. 100mil contracts are pretty common, but not 100mil per year.

A lot of money doesn’t mean smart money. Honestly you are truly retarded and probably shouldn’t be trading. Because not one of your positions are green. If you closed out your green positions you’re doing it wrong because you’re supposed to be patient with your winners and inpatient with your losers.
Yes I believe it closed in the 690’s and then went down after hours. Kinda strange gap up on spy and lots of others after hours makes me very anxious for PM tomm

The cost to close the short leg would probably keep you from wanting to do this. Best to just sell the spread and take whatever profit you have from the increase in premium on the long leg.
Was thinking 3750 into the end of year but it looks like we’re setting up for more. Bank buybacks and an XLF moon is the fuel we needed to get to 3800. I bet that sector sees 10-15% upside in the short term. Fuck in 2 weeks we could see 3900 because of it. Institutional buying in futures is climbing noticeably too. Don’t miss this train but also don’t forget to get off when the 10% downside hits maybe in a month.
Dollar is gonna be fucked after stimmy passing in congress. SPY 🚀
I thought I had discovered something special by playing palantir long term. But now that I see so many of you guys feel the same way and are also loading up on shares I feel scared
I’ll hedge this. PLTR 30% TSLA 30% AMZN 30% 10% MSFT. Should easily beat SPY.
Roll that to 01/15
High fiber intake and caffeine together will fuck you up.
I am holding March Puts but a lot of really smart people are saying some compelling reasons for the stock to keep rising.
Let’s hope PLTR makes future flights. To many paper hands. Long calls are safer.

Dot com bubble was empty websites having insane valuations, at the height yahoo had a pricing around where Tesla was a couple weeks ago but all yahoo was, was a email domain, message board, and smut news. I think Tesla is overvalued but they have a product at least and forward vision. Don’t think this is really comparable.
Price to growth is the more important metric for Clover.

If you have a significantly higher growth rate than your competitors price to sales metric comparison is not as relevant.

I was in the same boat, but now I believe if things get too bad the FED will overact and may start buying stock.

And tell congress, opps "We did not know the FED was not allowed to buy stocks", and "We did this to prevent a credit crisis"


Basically if buy you cant loose, and if you sell puts you cant loose.

Fuck no. Spreads are inherently more risky. Trying to dumb down t3 trading is a mistake, and t3 is above t2 for a reason. What are you going to do when the prices inflate afterhours and drop in premarket? There are so many risks you are overlooking and I would sincerely appreciate if you deleted this post before leading others into a hole they can’t dig themselves out of. Look into ironyman and you will see the negative impact spreads can have.

MELI is great for longer term. Frustrating if you do close or weeklies.
It absolutely can be as infectious as breathing in the same room as someone. But it needs a few things to align, some people (super spreaders) just seemed to spew out way more virus particles than others. 

A colleague of mine was dog sitting for two weeks. Didn’t see anyone the whole time. The family came home early, they had symptoms but didn’t tell her in advance. When they arrive home she basically gave them back the keys and made a quick exit. Less than 2 mins with the family. She still caught it. 

Close contact still seems to be the most common way, but there have been contact tracing studies where people have caught it through air conditioning vents on opposite sides of a restaurant.

I guess it depends on what the market expected.  A couple months ago, anything less than $1200 would've been a disappointment and been bad for the market.  With all the issues getting this through, maybe the market will accept $600.

Mine is really small compared to most, but I lost 1.6k on PLTR options last month.

It was my first time buying any. I started with 1k, made 1.6k literally overnight, and lost it back by buying more calls near the top. 

I feel like I was dumb, irrational, and greedy.  I was so new to options and gaining that much so fast was a huge rush, I think it made me put more money down without thinking it through. I regret it a lot but am trying to learn from it, too.

Switch to vape until the taste and smell of tobacco disgusts you, then quit and use every ounce of willpower you have to not do it for atleast a month. Avoid drinking too much because that's when I always caved. Start running or exercising, realize how sweet it is to breathe for the first time in years. Eventually you will have no desire to smoke or vape and wonder why you ever did

I’m sorry if this is a retarded question but... I assume tsla almost reached 700 Friday close Bc of its official addition tomorrow.... so have all the shares s&p & co had to buy been bought? Or are we we going to see crazy buy volume after an inevitable cash out ?

I’m telling you, the shit that this community comes up with is downright hilarious. If only I had better video skills.
And don't skimp on the ketchup packets
No, the $45 call you sold gives the buyer the option to buy 100 shares from you at $45. It will not expire worthless and the buyer can and will exercise it. You have to always keep the long leg ($30 Call) so you can also exercise it in that case.

What I'm saying is: let's say the price becomes $50 and the person who bought the $45 call from you exercises his option. 
What you do: You exercise your $30 option -> You buy 100 shares at $30 -> You sell the shares at $45.
Since I’m holding calls we are about to have a sell off. Sorry.

Sorry :)
This is an okay introduction. The scenario is slightly off and a better explanation of what happens after you open the spread would add huge value to this thread.

There are many ways to play spreads, in this case OP is talking about bullish call call debit spreads... if you thought pltr was going to 45, and you truly believed it, it would be significantly cheaper to open 44/45 debit spreads. You would essentially be able to open that debit spread for nearly any expiration for like a couple dollars each because it’s wayyyyyy otm. What’s the risk? Well it’s way the fuck out of the money. 

Why open the 30/45c versus the 44/45c? To give you a chance to be in a winning position. OP never explained breakeven, but if you pay 2.49 in OPs example, your BE is the underlying closing at 30+2.49 on expiration. The 44/45c I just gave? 44+.05. However, if PLTR closes at 40 on expiration, those 44/45 are worth 0, while the 30/45 is worth 10.00.

The 30/45 has a max value of 15.00, while the 44/45 is 1.00. But the percentage gain is around 5x for the 30/45 while 20x for the 44/45. Side note: If you really really think an underlying will go some crazy otm price by an expiration, its usually better to just buy naked calls.

Other things that aren’t explained, when your spreads out otm, theta is working against you. When itm, theta is working for you. Additionally, it’s possible to open spreads one leg at a time, although much much riskier, they can bring way more profit.
I'm glad I gave you a chuckle. I'm sure when I sell down thousands I won't be laughing

They are over estimating it's value.  If you can't get a profit in a pandemic you are done.  They have no moat, lots of similarly unprofitable competitors, and no real assets except the IP which ain't worth much.  Maybe if they expanded into process serving.  That pays like 50 bucks instead of 15.

They fucking stole $3000 from me after reversing fraudulent activity on my account. It took 2 months to resolve and get control of my account back. They stole $3000 by buying back my options at 2 month old prices and forcing me to take the loss for options that expired while I was locked out, because they were taking an unacceptable amount of time to resolve my issue. I had $8900 the moment I was hacked and all my options sold. I had $8900 after the fraudulent transfers were reversed. I had $5900 in my account when Robinhood actually returned control back to me. $3000 disappeared straight into Robinhood's account.

The Big One a/k/a The Reckoning is going to hit the market sometime post-Jan 20, 2021. No later than in the four years following that date. To me, the question is not whether it will, just the timing of it. It'll be some big catalyst that sets off a domino effect sending the market to hades. And I definitely don't think we'll get a V shaped recovery in the stock market on that one like we did on this one this past March.
Stay at home stocks

Best advice?  You have to really want to quit.  If you're trying to quit because your gf/bf/mom/doctor is telling you have to, but you don't really want to, it will never work.  You'll cut down, but never quit.  If you really, really, want to quit...nicotine replacement is great.  Gum and patches.  I tell a lot of my patients to get sugar free lollypops, keep some of these around.  They can help replace the behavioral addiction of the hand to mouth motion.  Chantix can be very helpful as well to some people.  I've known people to quit with hypnosis and acupuncture as well.  Lastly, ask yourself why you smoke.  I know a ton of people who smoke to avert stress, depression, anxiety, etc.  Try to find something to do that replaces cigarettes to avert the trigger.  Walk your dog, read a book, knit a sweater.  Good luck, if you can quit smoking it will be the best thing you ever do for yourself.

Honestly, this is how I quit, switch to a device, get hooked on that for a while, whenever you have an urge to quit after a while throw the device away, throw it as far As you can in a random direction so you don’t go looking for it later. Preferably a lake or something. Then After doing this 3-4 times cuz your gonna go buy a new one. You’ll realize how expensive shit is getting and you’ll slowly quit. Worked for me and my 4 buddies

Trading options spreads on robinhood is the most retarded thing possible. Robinhood won’t let you exercise premarket or aftermarket and most of the people with only a robinhood account likely don’t have the money to exercise the options they bought.      

“Dont be stingy with the price you put or the transaction may never go through” that’s how you increase IV by yourself and lose 90% of your money in 10 minutes. Learn how to work a bid/ask spread on stock before learning about it on options. This walkthrough was complete trash, and I would not recommend following any of this person’s investment advice.

Correct. That's why spreads are useful. The option that you bought (and gives you the option to buy 100 shares) acts as the collateral for the  option that you sold (and gives the buyer the option to buy 100 shares from you).

Betting on a drop on a stock guaranteed to go up is a bit risky. I would agree with your analysis though and suggest 30-50% in and buy the rest after dip just in case. Any news at all will blow this up.

4 weeks. If you look at the price action it’s gone up 30% a week for the last 4 weeks. 1.3^4 x 73 is 208. And that’s under ATH. Once it breaks that it should move up way more than 30% a week

Also, that shark reasoning on Airbnb is literally some of the most retarded logic I have ever seen. If that’s actually true that has to have been a “guest shark” because wow
Valid point. You could always do something along the lines of longer dated puts such as May or later for a safer play. I'm fairly convinced that DASH tanks between 10-20% this week though, as we saw those kinds of dumps from Nio, PLTR, LAZR to name a few, in the days following a Citron short. And imo, those 3 companies are much more reputable and have a better future outlook than DASH. I don't know too much about LAZR to be honest, but I'm bullish on PLTR and NIO in the long-term as are many others, but a Citron short report was still able to tank those tickers by a fair amount in the short term.

Looking at OPs post, he’s definitely right. The calls on QQQJ are dirt cheap rn and I don’t imagine that they will stay cheap for long. Therefore I am probably gonna buy just one bc I have a smaller portfolio but if this ETF starts getting some traction then the price of the calls are going to increase at a much higher rate than the stock price itself. So it’s a higher risk higher (and faster) reward situation. The industries that QQQJ covers are solid so buying shares would definitely be a good move for long term gains. I would say buying both shares and trading options wouldn’t be a bad idea.
Not wrong, but how high are you?
Yes... it's just the data tracking shit that's getting notice not just from this company, but GOOG and FB as well.  A lot has happened in the last four yrs that got swept under the rug.   I think he pressure on Biden to do something with big tech will be very high.

IIRC, it wasn't the put data. Someone had an actual human connection to someone in Melvin.

The put data might indicate something, but the puts are typically hedges against long positions (though 5M is too much). Their actual short share position data isn't available publicly.

This example was not an endorsement of the PLTR 30/45 call, although I personally think it's not a bad move.
keep in mind, if you were to enter before a break above the pennant you’re giving yourself unnecessary risk, because it can go either way, wait for a break above, then enter on the retouch.

I would encourage you to listen to Alex Karp's past interviews and look into who Biden is putting into his administration. Basically PLTR provides the tools and the govt is the one doing the tracking. Biden has been appointing past employees of Palantir into positions in his administration. Also, in the Obama administration 2010-2012: " **Biden** credited the success to the software, **Palantir 🚀**, being deployed by the federal government.[\[30\]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies#cite_note-30) He announced that the capability will be deployed at other government agencies, starting with [Medicare](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicare_(United_States)) and [Medicaid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Medicaid) " - [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir\_Technologies](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palantir_Technologies)

Homie you need to have your dog screened for PTSD.
apparantly since forever something about you have to pay what you expect to owe or at least 100% of what you paid the year before... basically though as an expat i can exempt up to like 106k of my income each year so my company gives me the option to just turn off my federal income tax. well my first year i ended up owing like 5k dollars, whatever, but then i owed like 12k the next year due to my income going from like 50k to <200k and my taxes turned off so my CPA informed me that if i owed money the next year that there are fines for not properly guessing how much money you owe in taxes. so long story short i've paid about 50-60k in taxes this year and i expect to be getting like 30-40k back.  i've also lost like 10k trying to make money from this subreddit so maybe more?

Check out the performance of health care companies under Obama. Don’t listen to political rhetoric where people try to degrade one another for political reasons. Obamacare is not government health insurance. It is government sponsored health insurance. Boomer stocks are going to soar.

Edit: never mind, didnt see the second pic.
Great, thanks for all the advice. I'm thinking of throwing $500ish at this, so 5 calls, but I'm not sure if it's worth it for the potential profit? 

If you only were willing to risk $500 does it make more sense to just buy the stock itself? Looking like we're getting $600 stimulus so I'm considering this a "free" risk lol

This has already happened, plenty of murders, look at the Pop Smoke case in the Hollywood Hills. Other issues include parties, prostitution, running illegal businesses out of rental homes, but none of this will slow it down. Home-sharing, like the Uber/car-sharing will continue to expand and become the norm. I personally believe in 10-15 years the main reason you will own property is as an income producing rental that you stay at a few times a year and rent the rest of the year.

Listen up: you are using online historical prices.  Those are ADJUSTED for the stock split.  Do you see the stock dropping 80% overnight in those charts you used?  No?  That should be a hint.

You are clearly new to the game.  TSLA traded in the range of $200-400 during 2017.  I don't even trade it and I knew that from memory.

When he bought in June 2017, he paid in the vicinity of $350 ($68-78 adjusted) and was actually down at the end of the year.

Please point out where the article says he paid $65, explicitly or otherwise.  TSLA is not up 4000+% since 2017.  You should not spout off about math when you don't understand context, you stupid child.
TTST ( Tik Tok School of Trading) not solid at all tho.
I feel like there will be so many sour stories of failed marriage, cohabitation, and overly extended friendship that it should be kept to a minimum. I wish my parents had told me not to extend myself for someone else. It’s definitely something I try to instill in the next generation. The chance of being fucked over is too high. You’ll be stuck with a car they won’t make a payment on, or owing half what you made the prior years even if the other person didn’t pull their equal weight.
Just take your next couple of Wendy’s check and do the exact opposite of what you did here
I think it’s within the realm of possibility for it to legit open down 5%. Regardless I think it’ll be back to ~16.75 by next Monday. It would be naïve to short this company with a possible contract with Tesla or a China EV company looming. 

But if someone bought weeklies on this... they kinda deserved to get their ass blown out. The play is April $17 2021.

It’s way more profitable for the girls to do than porn. That’s going to be the case even when the profit cut for the creators go from 75% to 50%. Without regulation getting involved this is a great opportunity. I’m not too concerned about profitability even with regulation though. There’s so much demand for OF that I think regulations is just a headwind - not a full stop.

Many of these professionals often prioritize corporations and greater good of our economy over individuals. For example, when Fauci on recorded interviews lied to the public about masks not doing anything and not to buy masks. Then later he admitted it was to help prioritize masks to healthcare workers.

The government lies to the public all the time. It’s what js best for our economy and corporations. They’re not necessarily wrong to do that, but it doesn’t mean it’s what is best for you. Medical professionals in my circle are telling me to avoid Pfizer vaccine, and to take Astra Zeneca instead.

Thanks for the response. Stop losses are currently set to avoid something horrible. But maybe I’ll move them up. Theta isn’t bad at all. But that is definitely something to keep an eye on.

you golden. at max itss gonna drop to 600...
Yes so if you were to exercise your $35 call when it hits the expiration date (meaning you actually buy the 100 shares at $35), and the premium you paid was $1 a share, then if the stock price was $36 you would be breaking even (BE price). If it was $40 then you would be making a $4 profit on every share you buy ($35 strike price + $1 premium = $36 BEP => so $40-$36= $4). Most people don’t exercise calls because they don’t have the cash to buy $3600 worth of shares so they would sell the call before the exp date. Say it’s April and you have a $35 call  for June but the share price is still at $34 so it’s technically OTM. But you bought the call a year ago at $1 premium back when the stock price was only $15 a share. At the time you bought the call, it was extremely unlikely that the share price would go from $15 to $35 so the premium you paid ($1) was extremely cheap. But now that the share price skyrocketed to $34 in less than a year, the likelihood that it’s going to be in the money (ITM) at expiration date has also skyrocketed. So the premium may have gone up to $6 a share. At that point, the closer you get to the exp date, the value of the premium is most likely going to decay so it would be worth it to sell the call to close and make a $500 profit off of the original $100 you put in. Even if the share price of $34 is still technically OTM at that time you sell.
USPS vehicles have the driver’s side on the right, so nope.

The study also did not measure bone density and admitted that it did not account for outside factors that can contribute to a higher bone fracture rate. We see this trend in a lot of studies that do not focus on vegan diets or not, that higher BMI's will tend to have a lower bone fracture rate. I think it would be then weird to draw the conclusion that a low BMI is unhealthy soley because of bone fractures.

Bearish. The market will read this as BABA conceding to the Chinese government, along with all of its ‘regulatory’ practices frowned upon by international investors.

Not saying thats the objective stance, just how the market will initially react. 

Long term, I think a case can be made that BABA stands to benefit from patching things up with the government, allowing it to expand its business freely with no government pushback.

I don’t think the new strain is a huge concern at the moment. These variants are not uncommon and unlikely to not be targeted by current covid vaccines. Covid in general is a slow-to-mutate strain so we won’t have the issue we have with Flu strains where we have to get a vaccine every year. What is concerning is that it can spread more quickly, so it is immediately problematic on that end but it will not invalidate our vaccine progress.
More efficient

Welcome to how it works
I would be incredibly interested to get a peek at their financials. They take 20% of rev from creators and are virtually entirely digital. Their expenses are literally web dev/hosting and necessary contractors/employees. They don’t even really have to worry about marketing because the creators do it for them. 

I mean theoretically you could get away with like maybe 5 mil a month tops in expenses. They make more than that off Belle Delphine alone per month in rev. Their profit margin must be *obscene*

The way they have developed such a potently incentivized structure for creators that organically grows for them is really just beautiful.
It’s a good stock but I don’t see it performing as well as some of the other brands

People posting about the new strain of virus, incase you need a reminder: 

Don't even ask the question. The answer is yes, it's priced in. Think Amazon will beat the next earnings? That's already been priced in. You work at the drive thru for Mickey D's and found out that the burgers are made of human meat? Priced in. You think insiders don't already know that? The market is an all powerful, all encompassing being that knows the very inner workings of your subconscious before you were even born. Your very existence was priced in decades ago when the market was valuing Standard Oil's expected future earnings based on population growth that would lead to your birth, what age you would get a car, how many times you would drive your car every week, how many times you take the bus/train, etc. Anything you can think of has already been priced in, even the things you aren't thinking of. You have no original thoughts. Your consciousness is just an illusion, a product of the omniscent market. Free will is a myth. The market sees all, knows all and will be there from the beginning of time until the end of the universe (the market has already priced in the heat death of the universe). So please, before you make a post on wsb asking whether AAPL has priced in earpods 11 sales or whatever, know that it has already been priced in and don't ask such a dumb fucking question again.

He was the first outside investor* in Facebook. He gets a salary to sit on the board and they get his insight into development. He did not create Facebook nor does he own it. I'm not saying he wont sell shares in Palantir, he most certainly will. He made about a billion selling Facebook shares.  But it won't be a single year dump with Palantir. A company nearly two decades in the making only in the last 4 or 5 years getting public exposure and very recently breaching public consumer awareness and business contracts. I'm not disregarding any information I'm saying the comparison is far from fair. A lot of shares will be sold by insiders at the end of the lock up. But far from all of them.

If there's 3 weeks of solid good news dumping leading up to lock up then I'll be selling my holdings too, but theyre not desperate and this company has a vast scope and a long future. There will be constructed hood news feeds, along with the demo and a bunch of interviews and the price will sustain over the short term, rising over the medium to long. 

Being negative and pessimistic is just as damaging to critical thinking as "disregarding information because you don't like it"

What are your strategies for calls that are expiring within a week or two, but are deep in the money and are currently sitting on hefty profits. Besides the risk of a catastrophic crash, if you are still confident in the stock moving up, any reason to not let them continue to run up until expiration or a few days before?

The stock has had a 300% run up. People are trying to pump this stock using proper grammar to entice people into thinking it is an educated decision. If you own the stock, sell it at 7:30 premarket-ish to gain the most value as investors will pump the price so they can sell out as institutions and bag holders start buying. IPOC/IPOD/IPOE are much better companies to invest in even though they haven’t listed. You guys missed the train on IPOB. Don’t make OP’s company rich by buying high and holding an inflated position.          

Edit: I hit this one on the nail. OP got cucked, and everyone who listened to me made tendies. Look for OP at the unemployment line!

The new strain might not mean anything for the vaccines.  Stop spreading fear mongering.  Antibodies against the spike protein may not have their affinities changed by the portion of the spike protein that has mutated in the UK strain, meaning the vaccines would still be effective.

What does OF specifically have that is unique? Once they grow to a certain size, other things will come to steal it's thunder.

First, you have paying for nudes. Nothing unique there. Secondly, they want to grow themselves as a "lifestyle" brand. Where people DON'T just sub to you for nudes, but for behind the scenes videos! or a special livestream! Aaaaand patreon has already being doing all that for ages. 

The only thing OF has going for it is brand recognition in the sex worker space. And in a lot of ways, that's actually detrimental to it growing outside of the porn space. Think about it like this, how successful has Pornhub been at attempting to have non-porn videos on their site? Sure, they exist, but they get completely drowned out, and basically nobody goes looking for them.

5. Sit back, relax and print money

NYer, went to LA last feb, can confirm it’s the people that suck and give Cali such a bad rep.

Don’t care about your stance on the virus, but just know survival rate is not based off the total population. 

Survivability is the number of deaths over the number of total positive cases.

Chipotle homie
Well let’s see: World of meters currently shows this:

USA total cases 18,141,661, Total Resolved Cases: 10,880,840. Total Discharged 10,555,838. Total Deaths 324,002. 

The deaths so far are 3%. However, of those discharged from a hospital, more die. So the death rate is closer to 4%. 

You cannot calculate the death rate on total cases since those are not resolved. The death rate on covid is well over 3% and yes I said 4%. 

That said, depending on your age, health, weight, and medical condition *YOUR* chance of death may be lower. Or it may not. 

It certainly is not 0.1%.

To me it seems like he’s more focused on SpaceX. His goal with Tesla was always to advance renewables - now that’s coming to fruition, but there is gonna be a ton of competition. You can say that Tesla has the best tech and have several verticals outside of cars, but I think they’re gonna get beat somewhere (maybe QS in batteries, Lidar-based tech maybe in self-driving, someone else in solar?). At the end of the day, a lot of people bought or were holding just for the S&P inclusion. Now I think we see a sell off, some due to inpatience, some supply/demand, and even some tax planning (some might sell before YE in case taxes go up next year, some might sell at the beg of year to lock in gains for 2021 tax yr). It’s obviously an expensive stock to buy puts on, but I think if you’re willing to put up $10k for one contract, you have a better than 50% chance of tripling up.
Damn. Sorry to hear that. I’m not smart or lucky. I just followed OG advice here to keep shit simple. Don’t get greedy and stick to Covered calls and cash secured puts. Literally printing money every freaking week.

I’m new to investing and have no clue what I’m doing I put a small amount of money into Robinhood I’m willing to lose (~$100) just to play around with as I learn more. If I get more comfortable and keep interested I would likely switch to a actual broker. I think Robinhood is a great foot in the door but not a longer term solution. Thats just my two cents.

Guaranteed Buffett has millions “lying around”. Guaranteed he has significantly more liquid wealth. Guaranteed his non-liquid holdings are more diverse and easier to liquidate.

Musk’s wealth is almost all tied up in Tesla stock. Even if he was willing to lose or reduce ownership, the liquidation of his stocks would cause the stock price to plummet, meaning his wealth also decreases

“the lock-up period "...is expected to continue until the start of the third trading day following the date of public disclosure of Palantir's financial results for the year ending December 31, 2020 (the 'lock-up period')."

The next earnings report FOR THE YEAR ENDING 12/31 is on FEBRUARY 11. So lockup period ends FEBRUARY 14.

Okay fine.. Why buy when you know bunch of the institutions are going to sell and increase the current outstanding shares? Lol.. The run-up you're talking about already happened. Now it's being pinned in the mid 20s till then
Yes, it is being calculated as not being part of the available float, because it was *not available*.

And you're looking in the rear view mirror when talking about GME.  No institutional investor does price anchoring.  Naive retail investors do that.

But, Burry, Must, Foss, and a whole lot of others were not in GME in 2017.

That’s exactly what happened. I started options and slinging real estate when it hit me I was just throwing it away. Wasn’t even because of me, one of my degenerate friends has lost over 1.5 million. Our last trip I lost 20k, he was up 70k and ended the weekend down 130k. I was like are you kidding you had 70. He said he had so much more to make back that it didn’t matter. Saw it, quit Vegas, and started using the market to satisfy my gambling fix
I'd probably be fine, but rather not risk spreading it to someone who wouldn't be. I'm not afraid of the vaccine, had plenty and never had any issues

I do not think management deserves credit solely for cutting expenses / reducing stores. Cutting expenses isn’t a strategy to long term success, it’s just life support.

I would prefer to give credit to winners that succeed, as opposed to rewarding mediocrity. When GME gets new management that wins, I’ll be the first in line to cheer them on with credit where it’s due.

He was the first investor in Facebook and is currently on the board. Pretending he was just an outsider looking to make a quick buck is not accurate. Look maybe he’s not gonna do the same with palantir but who knows just make sure you take in all the available information and don’t disregard any information because you don’t like it
After discovering options, why even play Vegas? You can literally get better odds just doing 2DTE TSLA calls and just double your bets until you win 100%+ and rinse and repeat. $1K, $2K, $4K, 8K, 16K, $32K. What are the odds of TSLA going red on expiration date 5  Fridays in a row? Maybe should do some stats on this haha.

A good example are bacteria. Staph aureus is a major cause of infection in humans, and there are 30 different strains. Some have evolved to survive even the strongest antibiotics. They are all the same species, but have different physical traits (caused by minor changes in their DNA). This differences are very small amino acid changes in proteins that either help the organism evade our immmune system or stop antibiotics from killing them.

i'm talking about the situation, not the virus itself.

"flu-like thing" in that the flu is pretty much constantly mutating, we have to take an annual vaccine for it which either prevents us from getting the flu or makes our symptoms not as bad, and even if we do end up getting the flu we have diagnoses and treatments and medications to better recognize it, control its spread, and help those who have it.

the coronavirus pandemic is certainly not a flu-like thing in that sense yet
nah
Your second paragraph literally explains why your reasoning is 100% wrong. Because they could not exercise they DID NOT own the shares yet it’s still being calculated as part of “unavailable float”. 

Also these “investors” own so little of the float. The majority of institutional been in Gamstop since 2017... when their shares were worth $50+
They HAVE to

Liberal retard on the loose
An influential epidemiologist has warned “THIS IS THE WORST MOMENT OF THE WHOLE EPIDEMIC”. Professor John Edmunds, a member of the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (SAGE), has said he believes much more “severe” measures are required to bring Covid-19 numbers down. “This strain has been increasing exponentially during the lockdown and during the Tier 3 restrictions that Kent and other parts of the South East have been under. “That is, although the lockdown was enough to bring cases down elsewhere, it was not enough to this strain from spreading rapidly. “We will need much more severe measures to bring the incidence down. “Worse than that, we are starting from a very high incidence already with hospitals stretched and United Kingdom National Health Service staff under strain. It is a very perilous situation.”

Didn’t you watch the Cramer video about market manipulation.
Lies. Like a 18 month old, they shit their Depends everyday. 

Aside from that, you’re prolly right...
Ok. 

So I’m going to speak in real money. So try to keep up. 

So an option is a contract. You’re buying a contract for $330. That’s all you’re buying. You get not shares for that price, just a contract. 

The seller of that contract is obligated to either sell you shares (call) at a strike price or buy them from you (put) by the expiry date. This is called exercising the contract. 

So if you have a contract that expires in 6 months and three months into the contract the stock moons to double the strike price you can exercise at that moment and force the contract seller to sell you 100 shares at the strike price (which is half of the current share price) and you can then sell them and realize the gain. Or you could sell the contract to someone else and just realize the profit without actually having to buy 100 Tesla shares which will certainly cost 80 trillion dollars by then. 

If your contract date arrives and your stock never came close to the strike price then your $330 disappears and you never get it back. It is very much gambling. That is the child’s version of it. It is drastically more complicated than that.

Why are people still so keen on buying pltr when the lockups at 12/31 lol. Legit just wait 2 weeks and you can get a decent discount/good entry.

TSLA YOLO. Cash secured put 276,000.  
690 strike. 4 contracts. Expiry 12/24. Premium $21,000................ I don't know but today seems kinda odd. No barkin' from the dog, no smog, and momma cooked a breakfast with no hog.

Valhalla is paradise my son u just dont Get it !!!!!
depending on the strike date (the date you are required to exercise the option by) you would pay at minimum $5,000 US dollars to have the ability to buy at that price.

It would still be the same virus, the new strain only has 17 nucleotide differences in its genetic material (RNA). It could only take 1 nucleotide difference in a gene to cause a change in the protein product. Evolution of new species takes a long time, even for viruses.
As opposed to buying options based on fundamentals and TA?
Then Who?

Yeah, I’ve got 500 shares and a laundry list of bullish options plays myself.  What I’m trying to tell you is “going to Valhalla” would literally mean death.  If you weren’t sure, Valhalla is: 

“In Norse mythology, Valhalla (/vælˈhælə, vɑːlˈhɑːlə/;[1] from Old Norse Valhöll "hall of the slain")[2] is a majestic, enormous hall located in Asgard, ruled over by the god Odin. 

Hall of the slain. It’s where you go after you get killed in battle.  People should stop saying this.
Also there will surely be some EV credits kicking around (either the current ones extended or new ones/expansions) at probably both the state and federal levels to bring the cost down even more.

PLTR probably hits lows 30s heading into Demo Day then hovers in the low to mid 30s going into earnings in Feb. If the ER is good then we blow past 40. then Lockoutexpires and it probably drops 15% back to the mid 30s and consolidates there before it's next move up.

it will be bumpy but rev  growing 40-50% YOY. their product can apply to literally any industry and as we all know data is growing exponentially.

Only a MM would post something like this
But the reason why Corona Virus is so bad is because that spike virus is very very easily transmitted, that protein changes might not be as transferable. The vaccine is Actualy really well
Planned out.

😳😳😳😳😳
And we haven't seen much yet. Vaccine will put evolutionary pressure on even faster mutation, and remove competition for the rarer mutations by eliminating the most common strains.
nah worst case scenario it turns into another flu-like thing. still definitely a problem, but controllable

Yeah, but there are also other EVs than the one you listed. 

Also, people don't buy cars like they buy phones. 

It's like saying that everyone will buy a certain type of house because it has more rooms. Not everyone has the same reasons for buying a certain car.
maybe they are curious if one is better than the other you know? like a trial? so if Family B is actually better, they just up and leave like in the good ol days.

Gold and silver - etfs (I’m only in SLV right now)

Others - companies. Teck, MT, X, CLF, WY. 

Also remember commodities are a spot in time bet. GLD and SLV would be inflation/stimulus bets you could probably play all next year. Copper I think will run a while. Lumber will fall next year without wild fires. Steel/iron ore will fall once Australia/China stop bickering. Don’t get caught on the back of the price falls.
Fabs don't work that way. It takes 4-5 years to build any additional capacity, realistically. If it was so easy, Intel would also just build more 14nm capacity - they've had wafer shortages for over 2 years now.

My company is one of TSMC's customers, and we can't get any additional capacity to meet the spike in our demand - and we're not even on the 7nm node, so not much contention for capacity.
noon it is

Was thinking about this the other day. And I believe the opposite. There are a lot of technology advances that are around the corner that are in line with future tech, if some company were at the forefront of one of those technologies I would think you could see a Tesla like situation.

Hell nah. Simp culture is probably not going to last. And the site is asking for some kind of lawsuit. I give it a year before there’s some scandal about the site. Either with tax cheats or underage girls posting on there, people getting outed for having accounts while they have other jobs, divorce, sex slaves being forced to post pictures by abusive husband. So many things can go wrong, asking for trouble. At least these other big companies like porn hub have someone of a vetting process. 

Maybe if they merge with another big company that has big boy/girl lawyers.

Because they promise a fixed allocation of 60/40 or whatever as part of their investment policy. Some do it automatically, some it’s kind of a foregone conclusion but practically does happen. Think of it as r/investing style portfolio balance.

All in on spy puts Monday AM?
From what I understand the vaccine has replicas of the spike that the virus uses to attach to our receptors on our cells to gain access through the cell wall. So as long as the virus' spike doesn't change much, I would assume the vaccine would still allow our bodies to recognize the virus and destroy it.
most theta near exp. give yourself timing space
They definitely started but my experience is it’s biggest second to last week and ends a few days before the new year. If they sold the full 500b Friday, we would’ve been down 4 or 5%.
1:1 accuracy
I always thought we were either 1 and/or 5. Nothing in between.
Key part is "We did narrow it relative to the language of ‘similar to’ because Democrats made a fair point. That was too broad, and that might have captured facilities that we didn’t intend to capture. Yes, it was narrowed" 

these will be closed like they were supposed to be and new ones under new names will be opened through congressional approval or an EO. Bullish.
No, it’s a gay ass fucking name. No tendies for you
Do you like money?
any RKT bagholders still out there? $23 this week?
Agreed. They even said they are raising prices and expect to expand margins in the next two quarters. Like WTF more you you ask for. Be an analyst and figure it out yourself. 

And if I ever have to listen to 18 analysts ask for more CoLoR again I’m going to hunt them down and punch em in the teeth. 

I do think it’s oversold but not sure if I can catch the rebound or not. My 300c’s for 1/15 are a little tight.
Comeback story
UK confirms virus mutation that turns people into ravenous zombies. It can only mean one thing: TSLA will be $10 Trillion by this summer.
Their’s a spike protein in COVID-19 that makes it a bitch. The vaccines target this protein. And rn, they don’t have evidence showing that the mutation that occurred changes the spike proteins. Also probably easy to make a vaccine for since rna is kinda easy to manipulate. We’ve been able to clone animals for a while and have chosen not to for ethical reasons.
I’ll bet you $50 that SPY opens closer to 371 than 366
Isn’t it 300

I heard the big ones had to do it on Friday because of the triple witching causing huge volume and liquidity, and that's why the FAANGs were down so much.
This doesn't limit setting up credit facilities. It's only winding down the ones that were already set up in march and preventing setting up "clones" of them going forward. 

Frankly no one is expecting another setup like this anyway unless a bigger pandemic shows up so it's a nothingburger
Your question assumes the first one “worked”. Also it assumes they isolated the virus, and not have a virus isolate. Big difference.

The option costs 15€ per share. So it's 1500€ for the 100shares. TSLA had big moves at eod Friday, so the asks and bid are far apart when market closed. Someone probably bought all the ask that were open right before close.
Look at the last purchase price to get a better gauge.

Oh i most certainly am, musk made me a millionaire he’s fucking solid in my book. He’s also going to take me to Mars.

Also whenever i have either of my teslas in at a service center or i take my kids to a showroom i always bullshit with them and talk TSLA stock. They all seem pretty happy with their employment. When i took the factory tour at freemont all the workers would stop to wave at us, then again the tour guide was constantly screaming at them to wave to us...

Seriously lament with your generalizations elsewhere you’re like the guy morosely yammering on about being broke and going through a divorce while everyone else is making money and having fun in the strip club.
Generally I just trend follow and try to focus on stocks that have news or a fundamental reason to move. Then look for trend continuation off counter trend bounces and also break outs or break downs within that trend.  It's important to find stocks that have a reason to actually move otherwise you will just get a lot of go nowhere slow trade and that shit sucks to trade for me personally.  Tsla in the last hour Friday clearly had reasons to move.  Other days most of my trades may not of worked.  Give you an example of things I traded.  Bidu on the EV news... disney on the investor day news and tsla on this news Friday.
Hilariously, if you bought 10 year munis in April and may you may be up 25%. It’s not Tesla, but pretty shocking.

Pretty consistent. That is very much not a pronoun.
I have a PhD in biology. The vaccines are based on more stable parts of the virus (spike proteins). It appears the mutated strain doesn’t impact the genetic material responsible for these spikes. So as of now the vaccines will work. However, new strains could evolve with mutations in the genetic material for these spikes and cause vaccine failure

I had a job working with SOCOM (Special Operations Command) they have been using PLTR for years and the military overpays for everything. PLTR is a long term hold off the gov connections alone.
[deleted]
Yeah probably. If I'm understanding it correctly, the current vaccine is meant to recognize the spike proteins on COVID 19 to illicit an immune response. If COVID changes its spike proteins on its surface, then the vaccine will probably be less effective.

I wouldn't be surprised if we start to see something like COVID-20 or 21 next year, hearing about this "new strain" coming out of the UK. Scary stuff.

No it doesn’t mean that the previous vaccine won’t work.

There is usually still some trace amount (0.4%+) of THC in it, even if its from hemp. If your receptors are sensitive 5mg THC might be enough to feel a little high. Thats just slightly above 1g of CBD weed, so its doable. Its gonna be very short lived if anything though. The CBD might make you a bit relaxed, too.

As a REIT they need to pay 90% of taxable income as dividends. Right now taxable income is negative while FFO is positive so you’re probably right on the dividend for the next 2-3 quarters. But they wont be able to elect to cancel the dividend because of a debt obligation.

People might be clinging on to the 'tech' of tesla. Fact is, in some regions, Tesla already got passed by others. How do we know? Because other EV cars sold more than Tesla did.

Isn't it amazing how people don't just buy 'the best' EV car but the one they like? That's the reason why Tesla will never reach majority market share. Because they only have 4 cars models. And two of them already had their sales crater so much they had to shut down production this month.

They're doing at least something right, so credit where it's due.

While I’m new to this sub, I’ve been lurking for a while. Those posts you see always make it to the top because they’re the real 1% of this sub. 

From what I’ve seen most people here play with some options, but have stocks as long term holds. I use 2-5% of my portfolio to be in options. I’ve been riding MAD,NVDA, and MU up for the last few years in stocks in order to give myself some room for options. If my options expire or I lose them I wait until I can save up more from my next few, but I don’t do weeklies, and always sell my options a week before they expire so no matter what I don’t lose something useless. 

Current positions:

Hella MU calls for 01/2021 and 06/2021
Some F calls for 6/2021
CRM calls for 03/2021

Stocks:
QCOM,MU,AMD,NVDA

new adds: GME (🚀🚀),PLTR,MT

Total portfolio under 80k but started at 20k so I’m OK with that return after 6 years.

Porsche could not *sell* their calls.  The shares they controlled were effectively locked.  Porsche couldn't exercise because they couldn't get capital to do so.  In fact, their loans were being called in.

None of the investors you cited are locked in any way.  They'll sell when the stock reaches their target.

They're not like you retards who think they're going to get $500/share for their pile.

None of those investors probably have a target higher than $30 right now.

He isn't. Shorting stock when you sell puts is not hedging - you increase max risk while reducing max profit.

The opposite of buying stock when you are selling calls is having cash when you're selling puts. If you're selling puts there are other ways to delta-hedge, and shorting is not one of them

Also keep in mind that they don't HAVE to hedge, it's just a sensible thing to do

Because shut downs don’t stop people from gathering indoors without masks in homes.  Majority of the spread is via private gatherings.  Also population, California has the most cases in terms of raw numbers but in terms of cases per million, they’re towards the bottom.

Maybe I'm naive, but I trust Fauci and I trust the medical professionals in my sphere who are vouching for it. Yes, there are unknowns. However, my personal risk tolerance doesn't lead me to assume the worst outcomes.

My concern is reducing my ability to spread the virus to those who might die. The jury is still out on that aspect of Pfizer and Moderna but I'd like to be fully vaccinated by the time we know the answer. I'm also taking it so others in my friends and family can feel more comfortable in taking it. Especially the more vulnerable ones.

The strike price is what you would pay for each of the 100 shares. The price you pay for the contract is a premium payment so that you have the option to buy the shares. Typically, options aren’t exercised, rather bought and sold for the premium price. 

For instance, I may buy a call with a premium of .45, then the stock price moves towards my strike price, and I sell my call for .90

Yeah mate it’s cool working in wildfire has given me the training to go to work in almost any industry to do operations, planning or logistics. It’s tight. Wildfire season is over and I was laid off- but now I’m on a project that pays quadruple what firefighting pays, that job is cleaning up the hazmat when a fire Burns a house. It’s tight. We use every man woman and child we can in the wildfire fighting industrial complex and it’s not a difficult job to get into
Jokes on you, we’ve always been in here

Which price is 330? The strike price or the price for the option?

In any case, you need to factor in what you’re paying for the option. If you buy a call that allows you to buy for $10 under the stock price and you exercise that and take the shares, then cool, you’ve made $1000 on the shares ($10 x 100)

But if you paid $2,000 for the option, then you’re actually down $1,000. That is why it is not instant profit.

They're a totalitarian society and locked it down ruthlessly. They shut down Shanghai airport and trapped 100,000 people when 2 cases were detected.

These Simps do it for “the thrill” it makes them feel empowered to pay for the custom videos
I agree with the part where they took the option premiums but I also think they wanted the 165 c's to be in the money so they can dump shares onto new shareholders. I don't think the people who exercised will hold those shares for long at all and will likely dump at open on Monday. Fuck DASH

We market do digital marketing to grow only fans accounts and I can confirm simps pay $100+ for personalized content. It’s not going anywhere. Some men are so pathetic that tipping these girls is the only female interaction they can get. Let’s be realistic. The average looking male will never be able to be with an 8/10+ without being a sugar daddy. Onlyfans allows them to live their fantasies without even leaving the house! So many loaded nerds with nothing better to do than throw money. I’d invest in the IPO if it goes public for sure.

Comparing Tesla to Ferrari is retarded. It's not car company.

Yeah, Tesla is, Ferrari isn't. about 75% of their revenue comes from selling cars and car parts. There's a big chunk coming from merchandise / F1 / race track .

I'm guessing the profit margin on their merchandise is a bit higher than on the selling of cars. I guess that's also why elon is trying to sell you short shorts.
The option activity on Vuzix is massive. Was up 200% on my March calls, came back down to 115%.  Makes me think buyout but at same time I should have pulled the trigger and closed at 200%. Hope it can continue pushing up ($10 would be ideal).

Would you agree when a stock swings hard one direction one of the keys is to just hold and not feel tempted to sell? I’m feeling a little upside down on VLDR right now. Bought at 20.70 1000 shares now dropped to 20.07 end of week. After hours is 20.37 so there’s some home, but I’m starting to sense this will still be a profitable long term play based on market sentiment and ratings of buy on the stock.

There's a pattern of a stock price slowly building up later followed by substantial selloffs by the profit takers. Market cap is quite moderate at 11.27b, huge amount of debt to equity, negative eps, and a beta of 0.97 which means they are as risky and volatile, as the market (3% diff to be precise). Their next earnings report is due in February and Q1 is historically one of their worst. I'd say short the fuckers.

There are no numbers for medium or long term side effects yet. Most traditional vector vaccines get studied for years, and we have a brand new vaccine vector only studied for months. Even the Pfizer CEO won’t take his own vaccine despite his research team finding him taking it one of the top ways to get public support.

Long term side effects of a serious Covid infection is not only extremely unlikely because you are in your 30s, but also barely different than the long term side effects of viral pneumonia. I still have lung damage from non COVID pneumonia. Shit happens.

This vaccine is clearly being pushed to help corporations and reopening of the economy.
I'm not against twisting it

Yeah a 6-5 hour work day is perfect for me. A lot of my work is researching law or translating and explaining it to laymen, or digging through somebodies books/evaluating them for whether they should have their books dicked through.

Pre covid I was in the office 50/50 and I swear I do less work when there are coworkers around cause I have to mingle, help other people, deal with drop ins at my desk, and walk a bit to far to pee and get coffee.
No, I'd give them 2 more weeks.  The stock will be volatile.  Definitely cash out on a nice dip, but don't count on it going below $100.  I mean it will.  But that's too bold a prediction to make within a month or so timeframe.  Probably after they announce earnings will be the first major hit.  But I really doubt the stock is going up much from here and definitely won't stick there.  Probably bounce hard $120-170 for a while.  I have it on my watchlist to buy puts right before earnings.
Its 7pm on 1/20/21. Biden, after all the inauguration speeches and meetings, finally gets a moment to get acquainted in his new office. He needs a moment of peace so he sends his staffers to keep talking with the press. Trump was not present at all during his inauguration to the surprise of no one.

Biden enters the Oval office and flicks the lights on but they're not working.

A creaking sound is heard and the chair at the presidents desk turns.

Its Trump, in boxers and a wife beater. In his hand is a crusty Iphone with Twitter page open.

Biden: Its time for you to leave, please go. Dont make this any more embarrassing for either of us.

Trump: I've been shitting my underwear all day in this chair, are you sure you want it?

If there's a huge enough mutation the vaccines will have less efficacy.   It hasn't actually been checked yet 100% but if it's different enough it will lower how well the vaxx works. All vaccines of novel viruses are based on patient zero so every variant of the vaccine is covered. If some new random strain is SO different they're calling it something else, then yes, the vaccines might be useful, or the might be entirely useless. The new mutation is called VUI-20. Mind you they were saying the coronavirus wasn't anything to worry about literally 9 months ago. I remember reddiors mocking people for wearing masks because people said they didn't work.
honestly, yes.  she's like u have to be brain dead idiot to value TSLA like a run of the mill ICE car company. and she's 100% correct imho.  "COVID has turbo charged our funds/vision."

It doesn’t matter population. You’re saying it kills 0.01% of people infected. Usually people debate and say infections have been underestimated. Fine. But even if 100% of the US had already been infects (they havent) it would have a .1% death rate because it has killed .1% of the total population already. There is no way for it to be .01%

You think the US has a higher death rate than the world at large? We have better medica care and more ICUs than anyone. We likely have one of the best survival rates.

Don’t know where you got that number but it’s mathematically impossible.

In only 9 months it has killed .1% of the TOTAL us population. And we are nowhere close to 100% of the population having had the virus. Even if 100% had been infected you’d be off by 10x but most likely no more than 25% have been infected, so you’re likely off by a factor of 40x

He gets the degenerates to start buying stocks. As the new buyers start buying stocks, OP can start selling based on VWAP and MACD at open to take advantage of volatility. Larger order forms at open and premarket which will serve as the best time to sell the stock. Check out the history of companies after they merge from spac to fully listed company.

You have to find the girls with no desire to get married. You also need to be careful, because some will just pretend they don't want marriage but secretly do.

That is why I stopped trading spy after March died in terms of the volatility. In March I only traded spy or nq for most part because that was what was moving any individual stock for most part.  Now though you have much better volatility trading names with news.  Tsla traded almost like the spy in March on Friday.  Trying to figure out where the spy goes on any day is very difficult.

That DASH manipulation on Friday caused the option flow to move from a bearish to bullish sentiment.  The MMs didn’t want to pay on our puts expiring Friday so they took our premiums to pump.

This sub is weird. Depending on time of day and which class of retards are on you’ll either get upvoted to Valhalla or downvoted to hell if you question the vaccine. 

I’ve also noticed it’s okay to question the vaccine more often than not but if you question Covid’s lethality at all then you’re automatically a Nazi.
I refinanced my house this year, and put in $50K into TSLA while waiting for solar roof. I put it into mostly TSLA and other losers. (-snow/square) I'm sitting about $100K now. Roof paid for, refinance paid for without waiting. Now I'm looking for hefty down payments for a Model Y and CT. The dream is hit a million, pay off everything (house included), let the rest work, and never stress about money again. Work will cover all my needs and provide great structure from there. 

1% fluctuation in a day is $1,000, 5% over three is $15K. It happens, but usually you get recovery if you hold long enough. Smaller accounts fluctuate the same way, but 10% of $1000 is only $100. Conversely, $1mil fluctuates in the same way, but those 10% movements are huge. It always stresses, but it's okay. My top picks this year have been named, along with Etsy. I think PLTR will be a decent long term investment, and I'm hoping to bank on NIO someday. Hopefully it doesn't get delisted.

WW3 back on the table boys
Sorry I wasn’t clear. Looking at the original article he downgraded when the stock was very close or even above his $41 price target and then upgraded to buy when the stock was $25 while maintaining his $41 target.  This totally makes sense to me as $25 to $41 is 60% upside which makes it a buy.
I have an 1150/1155 jan debit spread. What can I say? I'm addicting to gambling and needed something to spend the remaining $4 of buying power i had.

TSLA is launching the SPY into orbit so he says they are probably shutting VIX down
It does, but I don't know why you claimed bull flag? It's not flagging
Personally doesn’t believe they stimulate the economy, even though it is almost unanimous among economists that they help. Acting like he cares about the nations debt all of a sudden.
Lmao

SARS and MERS are the polar opposite of the commons cold or nCoV. SARS/mers had a very high mortality but didnt spread as easily and thankfully you could only be infectious once symptoms showed so tracking and quarantine worked well. Covid is the opposite in that it has a very low mortality (though we don’t know about long term effects) but it transmits very easily and people can be contagious even before symptoms.

My dad has never had a down year in trading including in the 89 crash, 01 crash, 08-09 crash, 2013 crash. I didn’t believe him when he said to get bullish in April until he showed me his portfolio. It’s okay to listen to people smarter and more experienced than yourself and acknowledge their brilliance.
I'm with y'all. I only FOMO'd in for some shares just to make sure I didn't miss the BiGgEsT sHoRt SqUeEzE iN hIsToRy. If I nab 2-3x in a few months I'm cutting bait and using the capital on something I understand better. I don't know shit about this industry, hell I don't even own a console.

I don't see any risk in sell puts (as long as they are covered) if it's a stock you want anyway, I don't understand why more newbies don't use this method to safely build a nest egg or buy a stock they are interested in if things go sideways. It's a win win.

I’m not very optimistic about the stock market right now as we move into the new year. It basically seems like everything is fizzling out.
Lockup ends 3 days after the next earnings, we don't have a date yet... It might drop for that, might not, might be already at 40$ and drop to 35$, nobody knows, but lockup is irrelevant a few years out (just not to say a few months out)...
12h in, it feels native on a $400 work laptop
11% of SPY is AAPL/AMZN.  Stimmy checks = buy more.  SPY going to 375+ this week boys.  Lockdowns also bullish as more people stay at home spend more money on AMZN,AAPL.

RIP Bears until after new year.

Sorry, I meant Jan 2022.

yeah that’s my point. People will probably receive money after the new year so presents under the tree will be kinda light in many households.
Yeah, moved to her state. Setup a condo. Opened a joint checking account for furniture shopping and put a few grand in. While I was asleep, she emptied it out and gambled it away on slots. When I woke up the first words out of my mouth were "I want to break up."

3 days after moving to be with her, I broke up with her.

I completely agree with everything you've said. Sadly, I just think we'll be in lockdown for 6 weeks minimum.

I'm planning for mid-February to go home to family for "Christmas" and Easter (April 2-5th) for my first decent with friends, I think sooner is unrealistic.

I hope your Christmas is ok mate. Awful time of year to live alone in a foreign city.

Anyone considering TSLA puts at this point? Would it make sense to enter a position like 200p Jan 2022? Is that dumb? Pleas help.

Most likey deposit was 50 bucks (should've gotten it back) on buying without exchange, then due to the period, oil being so high propane, natty gas etc would be high as well. Now its about 15 (if you exchange a can) back then I think it was about 25-30 with can exchange.

Still henny but she’s changing ticker likely Tuesday after the merger vote on Monday.
This is the way I see vaccines，price is kind of irrelevant especially in middle to high income countries.  Even if priced at 100 dollars still cheap as fuck.  Azn vaccine is really crappy..it’s efficacy rate is at 64%.  Let say you as a consumer would you want to take that vaccine that literally have that big chance of not working...I am sure you would be willing to spend hundreds of dollars more. Health is more important than price selection for buying TVs.

Also from a national purchasing perspective...it will take a lot longer to achieve national herd immunity with 64% efficacy as compared with 90% plus efficacy
It’s called the market

Imagine taking the vaccines when government, employers, and big pharm all have special legal immunity for side effects that is completely unusual. 

FDA approval is weightless... because they declared it an “emergency” approval and have no liability behind it. They were also pressured to approve. 

Employers can legally force you to inoculate as part of your employment... also with no legal liability.

Yes, there were bad decisions at the top. Also, it looks like going through a digital transformation and using sensors, BigData, ai etc.  (something Tesla has been doing since day #1) is just not as easy as it seems.

My view on the leaps is it will be a while until they are able to increase their dividend back to pre-covid levels. They are only paying .15 a quarter for now, and they have big debt coming due in 2023/24.

I also figure that I can counters the IV crush with selling calls on my current shares. February calls have decent premium at $14 at around .50, or I can even sell June further OTM
I’m sure you do

Can’t believe Dalio simps for this country.
My strategy is pretty basic. Basically buy leaps and use different strategies to pay for the premium. I do make large plays a few times a year and expose myself to unnecessarily large downside risk. That’s the position I’m in now and SPY down 10% would definitely hurt.

I was playing with the numbers this morning and it looks like .5% of my account into 5% OTM 7 DTE SPY should cover my ass. If I sold half at 10% down, it would cover all of my short term exposure. I’d hold the rest until either 20% down or they expire. It would only be for the next 3-4 weeks so pay .5% would acceptable. I do need to figure out a long term strategy though.
Oh god I don’t think you’re joking

No it can’t. Once you understand economic basics and do simple calculations you can’t lose money buying it at under 800k in todays dollars
Seems reasonable. The market is going to be due for a nice 10-20% pullback in Jan-March, which “nicely” coincides with the end of the PLTR lockup period.

If it is saying what I think it is, it means dollar shortage.  That is a graph of Eurodollars with implied yields.  The widening gap represents the curve inverting.

Stop being so gullible. How are you going to trade on the weekends??
Oh man, there’s plenty of blame to go around here. Local, state, and federal governments all have at least partial blame for this mess.

The reason I mentioned the California government so heavily is, well, because that’s what you were asking about. Also I live in California so it hits pretty close to home (literally).

The main thing that bugs me is what I mentioned above. If I were wanting to start a business, there’s no way I’d do it here, with the governor handing down edicts like some kind of monarch, forcing businesses to close without offering any real form of payment in return.

Of course you can argue that the federal government should be providing some aid, and they probably should. The short-term problem with that is the local/state governments are shutting down businesses, not the federal government. It doesn’t make sense to make working illegal, and then say that it’s not the fault of the people making the work illegal.
Are you the red carpet cleaner ?
How about we start a "MM's are fuk" trend?

Nofap is retarded imo. People with no self control blaming porn usage for their problems. I believed this when I was like 14 but most people are a little deeper than that. Gotta address what’s driving the porn usage.
And isnt this illegal? Like market manipulation or something
Which is a what % gain over $10 SPAC value? Or QS? But hey, let's not debate either of them? Your initial response is basically a big % is just too much. You are quite the genius.

I am talking about him coming to the US and making it. Contrast that with the people born and raised in the US and cry about how unjust this place is after getting a degree in Gender Studies with a cool $250K in debt.
250k yearly income (Canadian though..), 250k in the market (mostly boomer shit), 70k of that is what I mess around with, which isn't anything crazy like these other dudes buying weeklies or fucking with margin trading.

Yes you can buy the 230 CRM LEAP 2022 calls, sell the weekly CRM 237.5 or 240 calls. Repeat the weekly call sale like for 20 weeks and you'll be good. And the LEAP lasts 1+ year. Make sure to always sell the weekly call around 12-15 dollars OTM.

Not on topic at all but I will say this. 

2020 has ruined most people’s conception of patience. Normally you would have to wait years for 20-30% return on any investment. Now we are getting 100-200% on equities in matter of days or weeks. On big caps. 

Buffet would wait decades to get a decent return. People want that same rush in days after this years incredible rally. 

A rally in which, I must admit, I didn’t trust for the most part and lost 25k all in all this year. Feels bad but what the hell.

My main leg is going to be the 7/16 $80c. I expect to buy for $21. It has $15 of intrinsic volume. 

If ARKG drops to $80, then IV goes up. This preserves the extrinsic value of the long leg. Also, a drop to $80 would increase value of the put collar. 

Upwards movement increased intrinsic value of the $80c. 

This is a VERY conservative play.

**[International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis)**

The International Certificate of Vaccination or Prophylaxis (ICVP), also known as the Carte Jaune or Yellow Card, is an official vaccination record created by the World Health Organization (WHO). As a travel document, it is a kind of 'medical passport' that is recognised internationally and may be required for entry to certain countries where there are increased health risks for travellers.The Carte Jaune is not an immunity passport; the primary difference is that vaccination certificates such as the Carte Jaune incentivise individuals to obtain vaccination against a disease, while immunity passports incentivise individuals to get infected with and recover from a disease.

I'm not comparing them to themselves from say X weeks ago. I'm just comparing them to all tech names. So like if all tech sells off 10%, and A sells off 5% and B sells off 15% when they normally sell off together, I would consider A *overbought* and B oversold in my analysis actually. It's not super relevant and has a lot of noise but it hasn't been too bad looking at it throughout the year. The NVDA/AMD pair actually has been amazingly accurate this year.

What is this PLTR?? XD
Not really no.  Tech boys just have a history of doing that kind of thing, as evidenced by the whole hipster movement.  For some reason the role-playing they do is always either these hyper-masculine stereotype figures or working class figures, combined with some artistic flair of course.  I always just assumed they were being affected by society's toxically masculine views, and that was their outlet to make themselves feel better.

Legit answer. I work in Covid testing and have done a large amount of research with some docs at my university surrounding tests and vaccines.

The Phizer MRNA vaccine works by making your cells produce the spike proteins present on the capsule of the virus. Just the spike proteins. Your body naturally develops antibodies against these spike proteins after you are vaccinated. Upon exposure to the virus, and thus the spike proteins on the viral capsid, your body mounts and immune response to kill the spike proteins and whatever is attached (the coronavirus capsid and nucleus acids within). 

Long story short, so long as the new strains have the same identifying spike proteins, vaccine effectiveness should be unhindered.
Wait, there’s a virus?

Energy source: governments all over the world want off the oil. Global warning, continuous wars in the ME and reliance on foreign energy. This includes China...they don’t want to keep buying oil from the ME. 

Tech Lead: I am referring to Industry 4.0 or the fourth industrial revolution. When I say, it’s harder and harder to catch up, I am talking about a moving entry barrier. It’s not one tech. Look up Generative Engineering with AI for example. The market leader is actively collecting data from the product and feeding into the AI assisted design system. The product is improving at an exponential rate.

Geez what a pain in the ass. We got a few huge solar fields around here but never seen a solar roof. Probably not gonna find an installer. Ah well at least he gets a credit from the electric company that virtually offsets his charging expense for the car.

The vaccine isn't specifically made for one strain of the virus,  but instead is an mRNA vaccine that transcribes the spike protein which is common in all mutations of the virus. It inhibits the binding mechanism of the virus by smothering the binding proteins with antibodies that would otherwise allow it to attach to new cells.

The news cycle should pick up this narrative in the next 48 hours.

Yeah, used to work as a project manager for a roofing contractor and I looked into it. You've got to apply with Tesla to become a certified installer or they won't even sell you the materials. They want to see that you've done a decent amount of solar work, that you've got certifications in all of the related fields, a full-time electrician on payroll, etc... and because production numbers for the tiles are still really low, they're only allowing so many installers. There's a good chance there isn't a certified installer in your area even.

Potentially could be vaccine resistant.

Just a fair warning, QS borrow is like 900%+ on certain brokerages (like IB), so for 100 short shares you are paying like 100+ a day just on borrow. Means don't get assigned short calls. Also long puts have extra bleed.
That it will price in and tank as people already expect them to move like that like Pfizer. Lost 1100 on Pfizer last week. But then again Pfizer was everywhere on the news, Walgreens and cvs not so much. They also have earnings soon. This will be my last yolo if it turns out bad.

No it was the indices buying TSLA. Majority of S&P500 share buying for inclusion happens in the last 10 minutes of the trading day before inclusion.
I’d rate a solid 69,420. Congrats
That is not a qualitative answer.  LAZR and QS were each far >300% upon IPO.  If the response is that OPEN is no QS because of X,Y, or Z reason, then that would be a qualitative response, not simply because 300% gain is already a lot.
Oh man was that a bear spread? That seems like the worst outcome imo. So close to 700 too.

7/16 $80c only has about a 48% volatility.

It is higher than SPY, though, which has a 20% IV for the 6/30 ATM call.
Fuck China bastard Xi
This is why, when you don't know what the fuck you are doing, only buy calls instead of selling them OR if you plan on selling call options, only do so when you can cover them.

Same with puts. Buy puts for stock you want to own or sell covered puts for stock you want to sell but at a price you find favorable in a market that you think will go down in the future.

Average gains is the law of numbers; that's how you get green screens and not red feds.

The leaps don’t make sense to me because you give up the dividends, which prior to the pandemic were $3/year, or almost 30% return on current levels. The IV is also very high so even if there is large upwards price movement I don’t think leaps will outperform shares substantially. Happy to hear the other perspective though
That’s false. On top of that you believe there will be no side effects from this unknown vaccine? Brainwashed

It’s gotta be installed by a certified guy? That might be a deal breaker.

Well, part of it is that some people aren’t shrugging it off as well as they portray; there’s a lot of coping that’s done through humor. Some of it may be that the money isn’t fully real; when people start with low numbers the full realization of what they’ve gained doesn’t always hit in. And some people are smart and only play with what they have to lose, so huge losses aren’t a big deal because they’ve seen the huge gains and will get back to them.
It’s pretty volatile unlesss u open them at resistant points like low 3000s or high 3200s

Rather sort than not having anything to sort tho
Lol fuck that’s my favorite position
Mostly the chart. It's a good setup for a diagonal spread, but also has nice potential for a put collar to pay off as well. 

Main trick is to base it off of an ITM LEAP. I'm looking at the 7/16 $80c. Then, I'd use those to write a diagonal spread for the 4/16 $125c. Limits my gains, but I can't be greedy. 

I'd use the capital from the $125c I wrote to buy 7/16 $80p. This means that, even if it dumps by 4/16, I don't lose much money. 

If it goes to $80, I lose $20k. If it goes to $60, I actually profit about $25k.
Spy 375 eod Monday?
Then you ain't had really good pussy.
To sum it up: it’s a bull market

Not all bears are the same. Have you ever sold a position for profit? That's a "bearish" move because obviously, you're thinking price might drop. 

As the market goes up higher and higher, I become more bearish. This doesn't mean I'm expecting a depression, just a 5%, maybe 10% pull back. Gotta ask yourself when in history has the market gone up this much without a major pull back afterward? 

Even if you don't take a bearish position you could still be "bearish" if you're waiting for prices to come down before buying more.
Fair enough

one large issue with our government as a whole and how it’s handled but blame just gets passed down and passed down to whoever’s present.

Yea that’s definitely very true because this is a big reason why companies don’t put an effort into making vaccines for diseases that don’t reoccur year after year because they would be making a loss. Regardless I’m still taking the vaccine. You do you. this is a free country. I think  most people are angry because your statement made it sound like you are inconsiderate towards others and you sounded very antivax(hopefully you aren’t. It’s very clear that the our vaccines did and will continue to do good for the world). but you do have a valid point on this extremely fast developed Covid vaccine. Sounds little too close to a conspiracy for my taste though lol

The longer and longer I stay at home away from too many people, the more and more I enjoy it.

I do visit parks regularly to get out of the house, and now workout from a gym I made at home. I hardly miss how things used to be.

I definitely do. Nowhere did I say that. I just believe that a lot of the value from a truck comes from the reliability. They have the reliability and longevity factor down right now. I don’t think anyone gets a 2020 F150 and modifies it to be a coal roller.... I was looking into getting a truck but I personally couldn’t justify it because I never tow anything and a uhaul would be cheaper for those rare situations I’d need a truck. Edit: People would want to wait to see how the electric truck performs over time before they’d jump in before replacing there f150’s IMO could be a while....

There is nothing wrong with their business model. It's just that the stock is ridiculously expensive. Also, turning up profits consistently takes more than a good business. They need to improve their margins and even during the pandemic hype they failed to breakeven. Not a good sign considering the eventual drop in orders in the coming years.
They want to be "different". Its the same reason that people go emo or become skater punks.

what is the psychology of being a 🌈🐻 ? I really don't understand it.

a. Do you hope the markets fail to watch people lose money and suffer?

b. Do you think the markets are destined to fail because it "logically" makes sense after such a crazy run up?

C. Are you just an apprehensive, anxiety-fueled, glass-half-empty little biotch?

D. all of the above
Despite some hits and misses, they have actually done well in the long run. Being a short seller is not easy as well. Tesla actually is one of their worst bets. They said the stock will gain 20% max in 2012 and we all know how terrible a call that turned out to be. In this case, however, they seem to have got it correct. Uber is cheaper than DASH and Uber actually has a global presence and is the leader of the ridesharing industry as well. It doesn't make sense to pay more for a pure-play food delivery business.

 I don't have a refractory period. I dont need to stop after ejaculating. I can keep going, and I can stay hard. I also have very good self control, as in I can come when I want (not at all or as often as i want). So when I'm having sex i can go non stop, literally.

I just came over 20 times in under 45mins. I am not making this up. I just checked and saw the work record is 16 in 1 hr. 

I am seriously not making this up. Do you know why I stopped? Because I got scared something bad might happen. Too much of anything can be dangerous, and that idea put me off so I stopped.
I did 12 times before and stopped, but this time I kept going, and I felt like I could keep going even after 20+.

Side question: Does anyone know how I can profit off this?

I was 90% shares 10% options (for funsies), now 100% shares. I only had April calls, but sold them right after that disaster ER (still at a good profit). Not sure what's going to happen with the Cohen saga, so just holding shares and selling CC weeklies for premium
Michael Burry bought GME this summer when it was like $2. Now he's shorting TSLA??
It's your money, I'll keep an eye out for when you start crying about how BA is a shit stock because the FAA keeps being mean to it
Not to mention it already has the power to run the kitchen or espresso machine or whatever too- no need to add propane if you don't want to.
Maybe if there's some positive news about them, like a partnership or something.

I don't know man. I respect your opinion but those companies have an obligation (they are required by law) to maximize their shareholder profit. What if way down the line this vaccine causes some other condition which, miraculously, only can be treated with another medicine or vaccine from said company? I trust the companies even less.
2 yr price is similar to 1 yr give or take 10%. GME is basically $HTZ.

This was my best day ever. Last week I shorted tsla on Wednesday and made 25k which was my previous best day ever.  And 30k is no small amount of money for me either.  When I first started trading when I was 20 something I lost 30k over course of a couple years and was pretty depressed about that.  Luckily I took a break and figured some other shit out which has allowed me to trade rather aggressively than what I would ever have attempted back when I had a net worth of 20k
In sears we smears

Man, y’all banned me and it was lonely not posting here. Lockdowns and no WSB = depression
It was a good read but I down voted you for 2 reasons.   After that wall of text there was no ticker nor position, and because there is not a single 🚀 in the entire post.

GME needs to shake the industry. Here's an imagination:

Gamestop to have a virtual store on Xbox and PS5. Like a dedicated tab/section. Revenue share with Microsoft and Sony. And add incentives in games. If you accomplish a level or log certain amount of hours, get a promo code for 15% off on next purchase. Somehow they need to get married in these platforms. If so, $500 easy
The average person shouldn't be doing a lot of things my guy:

1- they shouldn't be pulling out $250,000 in loans to attend Devry University or some shitty liberal arts school that will give them a diploma mill degree so they can work at McDonald's;

2-they shouldn't have been able to pullout $500,000 loans for a house on the salary of a McDonald's employee;

3-they shouldn't be able to pull out a PayDay loan without understanding that the interest rate is 2,000% A FUCKING DAY if you're late.

4-they shouldn't be able to lease a car or pull out a $20,000 loan on a used piece of shit Honda Accord;

there's a lot of "shouldn't" for the average person in America. The question is, why does the government want to protect us from one aspect of a liberal economy (liberal as in Adam Smith, Fredrick Von Hayek liberal) but not others? Either tax and regulate us like the Nordic block to provide for a full welfare state or give us the freedom to do whatever the fuck we want with our money. The U.S. government can't have it both ways.

Selling cars now provides the funding for future ventures.

Who knows, but so far that one retard from January called it out. That Tesla's price can be infinite due to both GAMMA, retards buying calls, and shorts buying calls. basically TESLA is super call heavy thanks to WSB and shorts.

Also MMs still make money if the call they sell you is like super ITM, they are robots they never loose.

> Eventually you get to the point where you realized that you spent 2 minutes thinking about shorting 20k of some stonk and over the weekend you wasted an hour trying to save $5 on shipping.

It’s actually not so irrational.  OPEX vs CAPEX in a nutshell.  Spending $5 on shipping is money out the door; it’s not coming back.  A $20k bet is technically an investment—there are potential returns.

## Will the vaccine still work?

The new variant has mutations to the spike protein that the three leading vaccines are targeting. However, vaccines produce antibodies against many regions in the spike protein, so it’s unlikely that a single change would make the vaccine less effective.

Over time, as more mutations occur, the vaccine may need to be altered. This happens with seasonal flu, which mutates every year, and the vaccine is adjusted accordingly. The SARS-CoV-2 virus doesn’t mutate as quickly as the flu virus, and the vaccines that have so far proved effective in trials are types that can easily be tweaked if necessary.

Peacock said, “With this variant there is no evidence that it will evade the vaccination or a human immune response. But if there is an instance of vaccine failure or reinfection then that case should be treated as high priority for genetic sequencing.”

Different people are going to have different reactions. You got lucky. Think about this for other people. Like the old lady working at your library, or some old man like Cramer. Can’t be good for them if they get it right? Putting Covid aside, let’s say some crazier disease comes out of nowhere, would you take the vaccine then? Or are you only going to think for yourself and never even once consider others around you?
Nice
As if people aren't murdered now in their own homes? Porn studios already renting out airbnb for porn shoots. A family died two years in a row related to an airbnb and carbon monoxide poisoning.

Sure, it might be a little optimistic. 
But, thats assuming you did it on something risky like NIO or something. 
Take something safer like NVDA, and selling puts at the bid and current stock price, (at this moment)  would Net 2340 per month if you had 53k for collateral. 

So double that, and you could make at least 4k a month with 100k on the sidelines. 

Easy 4% a month. 
Thats 36% a year no including any compounding
Always or never
You pressed a few buttons and made 30k in a day.

You could do the same thing with a video game. (Or whatever)

Select the type of listing and even check a box to accept offers from GameStop.  

Either way, (just like eBay) if your package sells, you enter weight and box dimensions, and then print a shipping label.  It’s so easy. 

If you lived close to a GameStop, you could select option to deliver it to the store for an extra credit towards an in-store item. 

Shit. 

They could even set it up like an internal account. GameStop dollars or whatever. Basically offer higher rates of exchange to money in GameStop accounts. 

Then that money funnels right back into the store. 


Blah blah blah. 

It might not be a huge profit center, but it would be unique and a way to push their presence in e-commerce.

Not all viruses are equal.  The common flu is way less fatal than covid.  

[check out fatality rates of different diseases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_human_disease_case_fatality_rates). look specifically at viruses. Rabies, Ebola have > 90% fatality rates. Flu mutates every year but death rate is 0.0003%. That’s why it doesn’t wipe us out

The flu is constantly mutating, kills quite a few people per year, and would still benefit if more people took the vaccine each year.

8k x 12=96k. So almost 100% per year.

You can make money when the market is down - just a lot harder to do and very difficult to get this kind of money. 

basically we are all benefiting from people losing trust in the dollar and the US Gov’s system of injecting capital directly into the security and equities market. 

Think of us as little leaches on the continually bloating pig body of the market while the government hooks its mouth of a massive slop tube. As long as the slop tube stays hooked the pig stays alive and we multiply.

The reasonable play is that if a pre earnings run up occurs, maybe take profits on some shares to make yourself comfortable with bad guidance or liquidate some March/April calls on the crazy IV. Then ride out whatever your risk tolerance will allow. 

Personally I’m going to ride until Q4 earnings and sell $2k worth of shares to pay for the smallstreetbets calls i bought so if they tank I’m still green.

I think the real answer is much easier. GME sells games on a disc, but consumers would rather stream games going forward. PC gamers have already made that transition, and in the console market, both consumers and manufacturers are headed that way, too.

GME is a goner.
That won’t happen unless the economy is on par with a third world country.

Thanks for the info! I might toss 2k at it and see where I end up
Bro tldr
Do you ever think that people will divest from stocks (specifically tech) and rotate that money into non-covid stocks? One of the biggest things I noticed during the great v shape recovery of 2020 is that no matter how beaten-down stocks like travel are, tech always compensated.

It is extremely likely that people will dump stocks like Zoom and Peloton in the near future when more covid restrictions are lifted. Also more and more fed "tools" will be put away. Just some food for thought

She's gonna be mad bro, but don't let that deter you. Finances should be a team effort in a relationship. Imagine if you had gotten her on the same page before all this and she was saving as well. You guys could have possibly retired early.

Yeah exactly not saying I’m sitting out or being a bear and I’m getting downvoted lol. I’ll make money as well just don’t think it’s the best idea for our future

Bad weather sure but I don’t think this new variant was priced in. Definitely won’t be as bad as March now that we have vaccines. Guess we’ll find out tomorrow

At least savings rate were decent in the 90s. With it so low now, he's losing buying power.
Thanks for your input! I've used ToS / TS Ameritrade, RH, and eTrade. They are all okay, but ToS is pretty complicated. Wondering if TW would be better for spreads or if I need more training
Nice edit... Thanks you fuckin u/cumflakess

My Boomer old man yolo'd it back in the day on government lotteries as cell phone stuff was coming out. 30% of his NW on one bet. Came out with a 6,000% return. Hasn't had to work since...

I have a stupid question.

This year has seen a massively bullish market, which lines up with what you're saying. In a different year that is equally bearish and every stock is crashing brutally, is it equally as possible to make the enormous amount of money a lot of people make, but just by being on the other side of the bet? In other words, are there years like this one where people are making money hand over fist, but by investing in puts instead of calls? Or is there something to be said about the nature of upward trajectory where traders make more money on calls in bullish years than puts in bearish years due to more people participating in trading during a bullish year? It feels like a bearish year should lead to equal possibilities to make money by betting against stocks instead of for them, but a year where everyone is losing money seems unlikely to grant the same opportunities just by the nature of people not having enough money to participate in trading.
You asked he same shit 20+ times now. Literally all of your history is talking about your fucking 1/15 AMD calls
Our government loves us, they protect us, and they’re always there to listen. God bless 🇺🇸🇺🇸
I have 500 shares around $41 and one $110 2023 LEAP in the Roth. Everything has had such a nice run up, who knows, but I buy mostly LEAPs and shares. I like to see my wealth grow, not gamble on weeklies and monthlies.
Ackman tried to pull the whole market is overvalued thing but no one bit this time. He did make nice % on his earlier fraudulent March doom and gloom claims though

Vaccines only work if the herd is protected. Look up herd immunity. If I take it and 5 others don’t, it might pass along the other 5 and mutate and become stronger. Now I am not protected against that mutation despite having taken the vaccine
When you think of Tesla, it’s actually hilarious. “It’s not a car company, it’s a tech company “

No it’s literally a car company right now. People are on this 2025 bullshit again. Aren’t they only profitable right now because they are selling EV credits or some shit like that? Lol

Priced in ofc
No, because I know how to use google, lol. Historically, stocks usually go up on announcement day and continue it's rally until the day before inclusion (even after market close). Then (like 60% chance) it drops significantly on days after it has been added. The safest strategy was buying after announcement (monday 14th for mrvl), and sell on friday. Then,  again, based on statistics,  buy again on 4th day after inclusion (Christmas eve). Fun fact, stocks that have been extracted from index doing better next 12 months from 0 day, than those than have been added. It's not 100% scenario all the time, and I personally like MRVL too,  but odds are not in your favor here.
Thank god you posted this. Now it 100% won’t happen
God you guys act so fucking gay when you’re bearish. Just a buncha crybabies. We’re def getting stimulus passed. No one gives a fuck about cyberattacks, new covid strains in the UK, or whatever else you want to use to fear monger.

Who pays for news? If it's advertisers, then you end up getting more and more polarizing news because views becomes your metric for success. If it's the government, then there's always the risk news becomes compromised by corrupt officials. The safest and best way for funding is for we the people to buy news directly and demand high quality journalism

Oh yes Bc a 401k on a target date fund like 90% of people have who never touch it compared to actually investing in let’s say Appl or TSLA for years is JUST like stock investing.
Polls of every state show the voters think their representative is the only one doing anything.

That's some high quality shit posting 👍 legit this sounds like the premise for some New York Times writer's book. I definitely agree. The economy is too predatory, you are either the sheep or the wolf.

I think Michael saylor is too retarded and doesn't even belong here
If you a simp just say that
Some people can't take vaccines even if they want to because of being in compromised health already. We protect them by getting vaccines and reducing spread. This is what is called being a responsible citizen instead of a country of sociopaths.
Couldn't they have a bill that is solely to give people money with nothing else attached? Who's the main people trying to add in stuff that benefits their pockets?
God damn it
[deleted]
What’re we thinking boys, SPY 375 ??
If you want to stop the spread for good and finally have this shit be over with, we need as many people as possible to take the vaccine.
Everyone here is a fucking retard who can’t stand the thought of a debate about this. I’ll buy calls with the rest of em but eventually this shit will crumble and catch most everyone here with their pants down

Yeah the only free weights they have are curl bars up to 60 lbs, and dumbbells but those only go up to 75LB.. so if you're actually decently strong, probably not the best place to make gains. But still, in a pinch you can make it work with the smith machines, that's what i do because i'm cheap..
I think I am going to be bag holding my oil stocks come Monday because of those tea-drinking europoors in the UK

papa going wild on twitter 😂
What the heck is wrong with papa Elon with series of tweets? Is he jealous?
does this do it 4 u      : )
Almost as if employees use hand sanitizer, gloves, and are behind a bar + spit shield. No shit they didn’t get it.
So we got, 2.5-3K deaths a day, new infectious covid strain, hospitals still overrun, literally everywhere in Europe on full lockdown, majority of US lockdown, government on the verge of shutting down with millions still about to be evicted and standing at food banks, v shape recovery not so much v shaped anymore, idk where that is coming from. V shaped recovery my ass. 

Then the stimulus that is only $600 a check. How tf is this supposed to help? 

Like in March people were getting $600 a week, and then the $1200 stimulus check.

Anyway, TLDR; SPY 400 EOY.

What about the South Africa one? That was also just announced and their health minister said it kills young people
This sub is so money hungry it’s cringeworthy.
Ok so again you've just pasted some text, no info. Anyway you're the paranoid one thinking there's covid in the air all around you rather picking your nose with your grubby fat fingers that you can't even wash properly despite using alcohol gel a million times a day

Yeah have you ever lost $2495 in under 18 seconds?  They give you an award I think.  Dumbest trade of the year or something like that.  That's why I did that trade. I just really wanted that award.

Amazon literally came out with their drug store... didn't moon much.   
Apple has a lot going on. iphones are not available in stores. pros. they had to up their production by 30%. rumor of EV bussiness. if it's confirmed in any shape or form... oh lawdy lawd.

Tell her you’re filing for bankruptcy and that you’ve been hiding it as you’re ashamed. Look at what the next few weeks bring, if she’s being distant and uninterested or if she’s supportive. You’ll only then know what to do
They would probably be right and it would beat, but it would end up dropping anyways and wipe everyone out
Hate Sunday’s cuz so boring and only less then 24 hours till market
Ok but regarding your post just do know that market isn’t going to crash till the sentiment changes we are not going to see bubble burst, right know the market is very bullish no one wants to sell regardless of the sector. 

Unless we have some bad vaccine data/new strain being immune to vaccine, potential conflict with Iran or fiscal deficit issues. Only latter is a possibility in 2021 which could a trigger sell off remember early 2010s
Elon is just a kid in a man's body. Thats where the creativity comes from, kids.
The 10th percentile one?  Yeah I liked that too
Everything
Lol
What if the UK virus mutation does actually make the vaccine useless? No government will say that's a possibility, but they're all clueless.

New strains of the Rony gonna render the vaccine useless.  Market is going to skyrocket!
I actually want to market to open blood red tomorrow just to see all the bears load up on puts before the insane run we are about to go on. We might not shoot way up from stimmy news, but there are almost no reasons to sell stock right now. The future is very bright 6 months from now with a lot of stocks still undervalued. Only short term investors might sell stocks for a month but even that play is capping the potential for huge gains.

Dow 29.5k is the lowest the market goes for a long time, Spy staying over 360 as well.

No problem, it's fun to look at and to be honest it has me thinking about putting almost everything in ARK. Go to the combined holdings for CRM for example and you can see how they timed selling everything they had off almost perfectly right before the recent dip and bought back in right after.
It means shorting is astronomically hard and it's gotta dump bigly to profit.

Lots of people upset about the APHA/TLRY merger, but I am seeing a lot of upside. The industry was needing consolidation and I see the new TLRY coming out on top with US exposure and just pure market share advantage. I see some hype running it up to with earnings and the senate run off coming up. I am already -10% on the position and TLRYs financials are terrible though, so who knows
Last time FED fucked with interest rates and tried to pull some money out of the market we crashed like 5% the next day, it’s extremely difficult to do and not spook the market, combine that with how fragile it is now I think it’s safe to say we’re gonna be in a bull market for a while. However if there is a big catalyst that puts us in a downward spiral it will be fucking catastrophic
Good to know that Elon is a retard too

You have to marry the stripper and let her take half your shit and still be divorced by New Years Eve.

Tough ask.
I think it'll run at least $10 from here. Why? Because by doing that, it'll make a U shape from the top in Dec.
It’s going back in and out of the same contract that screws you. First year I lost a ton but a lot of my losses were disallowed because of this.
The company and their practices are irrelevant! We just care about the potential tendies you autist.
Is this the beginning of the new "roaring twenties" or is it like that story about shoe shine boys are giving stock tips?
Bears, I’m so sorey
I’m 5000 miles away I should be fine

Not likely
So cocaine and strippers and fuck you money to pay the irs? Sounds like a fucking steal.
Someone posted an article here saying that. Institutions are sitting on several trillion in cash and are getting antsy.
I said this a while back and got a bunch of backlash. Money ends up just being a number. 

Digressing on the point of money being a score.  

Reckoned about that one AI and that was taught to just monitor the score and the list of actions to perform available. It was playing pitfall and killing it with no other knowledge of how to play the game. 

I really wonder if they can’t just unleash that on past stock data and news for training. Then drop it into a paper money account with the same news. Basis of some futuristic film where the ruling families all have AI hives that play the stock market. Those people wouldn’t be offering the secret spice as “zip recruiter training course” for $399. Maybe then people will realize the market is just one big Ponzi scheme.
Everyone is conditioned to buy the dip. But what if it doesn’t stop dipping, then that just causes a further faster collapse when all the weak-moderate hands get shaken out? 🧐🧐
Sad that I can only lose money four days this week.

Yeah QE is only QE when there's a high debt load and average credit is plummeting.. nowadays credit has contracted so much, an expansion is due again and i believe that's what the Biden administration will trigger. Finally an expansion cycle after a 10 year contraction..

Well if you wanna reduce the tax bill the best thing to do is go all in on TSLA $900 calls that expire this week.

That ought to help quite a bit.
Wow do some DD retard, they just recently launched for the public commercial sector. Plus they will get huge $$ now from the US government agencies because of a new bill that passed. Wow stfu if you are so ignorant

PLTR tech is on some next level shit, they make the iPhone look like a dumb baby toy for dumb babies. Honestly idk wtf they were doing 17 years ago or even 5 years ago but their product has been rapidly evolving, I don’t think it makes sense to judge them on how long they’ve been in business with how much the tech landscape changes every few years

Alright you idiots THIS is what’s happening:

Market is shifting towards the future for the first real time this century. Think dot com bubble, but with physical resources that have some intrinsic value and long production lines. Market should be down, obviously, BUT certain parts of it can and should be up (electronics, EV tech, commodities, communication, etc) because the market is shifting in their favor... BUT a combination of market manipulation via the Fed and MMs holding onto the past is driving up the price of everything. 

I expect the general market to fall, and sectors I listed to be relatively unscathed. We have some weird reverse bubble, where we are treating the stock market as one unit instead of different markets.
Just blow it all on coke and strippers, then you won’t have to explain the financial gainz to her Cuz there won’t be any

Now I’m thinking I should have said fuck the creditors and all-in TSLA with that $15k. I’d be a fucking Tesla millionaire ughhh hindsight fuck hindsight

People do not buy recently released games with the hope of resale in large enough amounts for this to be a factor.

Also the future of gaming is cloud computing. And subscription based models aka like netflix but with gaming. Aka xbox gamepass etc...

You all are wrong. So very wrong.
Short term I'd say its probably a bit overstretched. But Tesla was around in 2003 and they didn't turn a profit until when? late 2019 or 2020?

I don't own this (I did at 9 and sold at 15, missed out on a bit), but if you genuinely read up on them, their tech seems to be the future and they are essentially half backed and funded by the CIA / Gov and are expanding into the commercial business
Huh?

If every single person that went to the hospital for any reason was tested for the flu, and anyone with the flu died, there's your difference in numbers. Most people just get a flu and deal with it. I've never been flu tested in my life I just deal with the flu.
It needs some sort of catalyst for it to go back down. It is obviously frothy. 

So if you want to short it, you'll probably have to wait for earnings. Something tells me their cost of production is going to shoot up a lot.

Anytime someone tells you something about money they are overstating it.
Don’t understand the fascination with PLTR. They’ve been in business for 17 yrs and still haven’t been able to generate positive net income or operating cash flow.  You can’t say that other tech do the same thing because they all became profitable within several years after initial loss years.  PLTR has had 17 yrs! Only thing that’s changed recently is them going public.  More cash = exponential growth company now? 🧐🧐

Listen to me right the fuck now, you DO NOT tell your wife, you hear me? The fastest way to become a millionaire is to become a billionaire and then file for divorce. You do this the right way. Put that away in some alternate account or something literally UNTOUCHABLE by anyone else other than yourself and you do NOT TELL—for the love of god, DO NOT tell anyone else about it. Not your best friend, not your sister, or your wife’s boyfriend. Live off the interest and go on trips by all means but YOU WILL PROTECT THOSE GODDAMN HARD EARNED TENDIES AT ALL COST, GOT IT?

Exactly that’s why there hasn’t really been inflation, banks are only lending to upper 5% who don’t spend except on more and bigger houses, better education, finer foods, and better tech. Rich get richer, and the genius fed response is to give them more, thinking it will make its way to the plebs.

I know what the fuck delta hedging is. Read your own goddamn link and tell me how shorting helps hedging your sold puts you retard.

Shorting stock when you're short put substitutes limited loss by infinte loss, it's making the play riskier while minimizing profit. Here, I found a link for you so that you'd learn how to hedge naked puts: https://optionalpha.com/hedging-short-naked-puts-210369.html

Ah yes, the decent business model of being a middle man, selling hard copies of an increasingly digital good. And buying phones while being known as a middle man game company that rips you off on trade in prices.

Lol you guys are the best. You start at the answer you want and work backwards. Perfect science everytime.
What? This better be satire
TSLA is likely going to dip in the near future.  It's pattern is that after a dip it consolidates for a short period of time, then resumes it's upward trajectory.
It's not worth it if its affecting your mental health, but at the same time you gotta weigh steady pay against your bills.  Don't make a hasty decision and make things worse down the line, you know?

I can say this with 100% certainty. Your life has been changed forever. Just remember for each gain post of $1M there are 10,000 people who lost everything.

Work in CPG and have explored numerous packaging innovations. The issue isn’t that the company (well marketers) aren’t interested - it’s that consumers won’t actually pay for it. No one wants to see there cookies cost $.25 more because for whatever reason consumers can’t make the connection that “I want a better world” to “I have to do my part to pay for it”

Why would they not need senate approval? senate is part of congress.
Early to Mid 2021 will still be a bull run. I'm more fearful towards end of 2021. Countries will keep pumping stimulus into 2021 but they gotta cut the cords eventually.  Meaning, we'll see a lot of industries NOT make it in a post-covid world. 2022 will be a shit show because no one knows how long the vaccine will last.  Fake news media will scare the public saying covid has mutated and vaccine is not effective anymore, blah blah blah.
Im up 300% this year. How are your earnings nerd?
Hope not, putting 25K into DRIV at the open
I wonder if Tesla monthlies will be the move tomorrow
No. What do you think a partial reason of WBA’s drop in 2016 was due to. Brexit. And the other part was the Rite Aid acquisition. Then you also have to contend with all the fuckery going on now in the UK. And Walgreens possibly either pulling guidance or not providing it due to this. 

Could it have a nice earnings run-up? Yeah absolutely. Will it double back to $80 within the next half-year as some are suggesting lol fuck no.
Yeah this was lazy I admit. I meant there's a chance of stimulus failure depressing stocks. That's gone now
150% gains

To get fucked for 2k by a gay bear. Sold out. Waiting to get back in. Next tsla I think now that tsla all grown up and shit in the spy.
I have no idea.  If I had to make a guess, probably not much.  The Cares Act was supposed to be ended at the end of the year anyways.  If the Dems take the senate in January, then it won't make a difference.  If the GOP holds, it could be a problem if there is a crisis.
You’ve got an aging fleet of postal service vehicles and an incoming administration that is looking to go green. 

I’ve seen how California has embraced EVs in government applications and I think it’s a matter of time before the US federal govt does the same. 

I’m into the Canoo. I think commercial application EVs are the way. Once you can make it more affordable than gas vehicles (or the govt gives go-green incentives) you’ll get your large delivery companies on board.

It’s just a matter of how long.

So priced in money was not spent and now the stimulus on balance is smaller than expected.

Seeing crazy weekly FDs in risky stocks is entertaining as all hell, especially when some autist seems to hit over and over and greatly increase the size of their portfolio.

But a lot of us are somewhere in between absolute degeneracy and boring r/investing stuff. Especially if you have a decent chunk of money in the market. Along with DD, it all comes down to risk management and understanding what kind of target (realistic) return you want from your portfolio and sticking to it. Knowing when to 💎🙌 or when to pull out of a position early, even if there's some runway and it literally can't go tits up. Take the profits and don't get too greedy.

Also, there are a number of us that maintain separate portfolios. I have a bigger one that I rarely touch that is invested in safe ETFs (actual shares), and then a smaller active portfolio. This little divide helps me maintain risk and not let myself get too deep into a position that might backfire.

My active portfolio is around 80% selling cash secured puts/covered calls in a diverse array of stocks I wouldn't mind owning, the other 20% is either in LEAPs, >60dte debit spreads, or cash to take advantage of opportunities when they arise

This new stimulus bill is hilarious. If you break it down it's actually $500 billion of new money plus the $400+ billion they clawed back from the Fed. For the longest time, people assumed that $1200 stimulus checks were in the bag, however, they are gonna get half that. Furthermore, the weekly unemployment benefits sit at $300 a week, as opposed to the original $600. Not to mention, no state or local aid.

To top it all off, the Fed has new restrictions placed on it preventing some of the credit facilities from reopening past Dec. 31st without congressional approval. 

Also a daily reminder that a bigger and better stimulus could have been achieved 4 months ago had Nancy Pelosi not been such an evil person. Take that as you will.

Naw....
Lol in thinking that Apple was at any point in the last 5 years contested in value enough to rocket.  Apple has a P/E.  That in itself limits its valuation as so many holders benchmark that number as justification.  Which completely discourages growth and contested share price appreciation.  I would be surprised to see if 10% of stock that blew up had a 20-30 P/E before they blow up.  That’s not how you get growth.  Earnings are how you sell your growth off to “dividend” jerk offs.  Reinvest that money in the company and leverage that shit into higher paying innovation like a true CEO.

I don’t think that QE powers are stripped right? It’s just removing the lending programs they started in March and requiring congressional approval to restart them. My understanding is they didn’t even really touch that money anyways. But it was there if they needed it. The fed will still be buying govt bonds etc. if they took that away holy fuk.

I tried to give it away but no one I know knew anyone who needed it.. fucking twin size..).  I was putting it together and I was like how is the mattress going to fit because my mind wouldn't go to the place that it was the wrong size for a while then I was like **FUCK**.  Still no bed frame cause fuck it I'm single and it's even dirtier when I have women over.. cause no woman is going to walk out once they are in your bedroom and their clothes are half off- *magical*

The Cares Act in March gave the Fed a truckload of money to distribute as loans.  Toomey wants to wind the program down so the incoming admin doesn't have a "slush fund".  The Dems are pissed because it will potentially make the Fed's toolbox more limited under Biden.  They are compromising by saying it can be restarted with Congressional approval.

If you don't make gains it's not really about the gym, it's about your attitude/lack of hard work.

There's no way loan or rent deferment will be forgiven, so anyone who is delaying payments are going to get fucked. The best thing the adminstration can do is to allow people to file bankruptcy without a credit score hit if it's due to covid.

why do we need 100 posts about this wedge
Got it, so use gains to buy a house next to UPS store.
you either die a simp or live long enough to become a cuck
The 7 DTE go from Monday to the following Monday. On the following Monday, I’ll buy another 7 DTE hedge. So I always have my hedge on (and briefly 2 hedges during Monday). 

But still you are right that my hedge can be less effective if the timing/magnitude is just right: ie start to plunge Friday and the following Monday but not enough swing/volatility to profit from current hedge. And then the new 7 DTE hedge just becomes more expensive. 

Someone wisely brought this up in the comments as well. My thought process is once VIX goes below $15 or so for an extended period, I’ll switch to 30 DTE and possibly look into rolling to the next monthly after 14 DTE. 

I consider “Black swan” as really going from the middle of the bell curve to the tail (VIX < $15 to VIX $60 like in March). This is what I want to protect from. Going from jolly easy mode to pants-shitting boss mode in a blink. That’s what scares me and what happened in March when I watched my short puts go up 50X in value. 

VIX at $20 (currently) means there’s still some decent fear and inflated premiums. I can handle it going to $40 w/o taking losses (this happened during the election when I still had no hedges). If it goes to $60 from here, I’ll be glad I have my 7 DTE hedges even if the timing is off.

Rising COVID cases causing lockdowns once again, new strain of the virus in the UK is 70% more transmissible, and the imminent collapse of the rental housing market seem like some pretty good reasons for a correction to me.  Not to mention Congress can’t even meet their own deadlines for deals (see Friday).  

Also, why would republicans ever vote for another stimulus when it’d help Biden?  They’re still planning to muck up the vote tallying in congress on January 6th for fucks sake.

I do believe that with an iron-clad vetting system, OF would do well, especially if celebrities keep coming onboard.
Yes
this is the way. start small and work up as your gain confidence and experience. i started with a few hundred in my account and now have over 25k to enable day trading. i still remember i thought buying 50 dollar of a stock was a lot and 100 dollar was insane. now buying 20-50k in a stock at one time isnt that out of the ordinary. if i would have showed the future to myself back then, i wouldnt have believed it. you'll be able to retire before you know it if you consistently invest and make good decisions.
I can’t believe that this is an actual video that exists. Retards throwing their life savings at meme companies. Proof that we’re in a simulation

If walgreens is like CVS, they aren't even giving the vaccine in store, but at offsite locations to protect employees and customers. This could invalidate 2 of your points entirely.
Serious question, after requesting a refund from Amazon, have you ever got the refund WITHOUT actually sending the item back? Happened to me once. Anyone else?
I’m going to YOLO my whole company on Tesla because you posted this!
Great point. Thank you.
Tesla is tricky to roo. Apple is a fuking breeze. It’s hemmed in tight af. Puts near $130, calls anything under $120. Spy is easy, too, and no big swings to fuk you. 

I do think Tesla is in for a dump but no fuking way I’m betting against it.

Funds literally bought the top. 

The price action in the last 15 mins of Friday when Tesla was down 5% is the true sentiment of the stock. People got worried that perhaps the Funds already purchased most of the shares and panic sold. Then in the last 10 minutes the real buying began. Now that all of the shares have been purchased the demand is no longer there, and price will follow. Curious how the stimulus news will affect the stock though.
Hold! The MMs are desperately trying to keep the price down! But they can only do so much. Palantir’s gonna hulk dick the sky in the coming weeks!
That’s smart
No it does not, it doesn’t impact the primary bond buying facility. If that went under, EVERYTHING is fucked, banks included

After all bills paid including groceries, leaves 4k. Would that be from working income or sleeping income? Makes a difference. If working save that shit, and invest. If it's income you're getting regardless of work, then splurge but save some for more investing.
Have how other companies done? Are there major porn industries that trade stock? How have they don’t over a long period?

I don’t personally see them going public or doing well if they did but that is only because I don’t know how the security and privacy piece will hold up.

I’m not a huge fan of sex work, but I am a big fan of keeping people safe. If girls want to show their bodies but not be subject to all the terrible things in the industry, well better to do it at home than risk the other option,

Found a few good reasons why porn is unlikely to go public. It probably blends well with onlyfans.

Doesn’t affect them, no urgency.
I read through some of the comments and it seems you're just as concerned about her supporting your trading going forward as you are telling her about it (and your profits).

I like the "bad news: I've increased our tax liability" approach on telling her.

Going forward, I'm sure y'all have some shared goals, and having the financial means to achieve them has to be within reach for some if not all.  So....

Perhaps you take out your original basis that you started and put it into "safe"/non-tradable investments.  Second home?  Kid's college fund?  Boomer dividend stocks?  Whatever you are both comfortable with.

Get the agreement on that, and then if y'all are both comfortable continuing, trade from this year's profits (after you set aside the money to pay 2020 taxes. - very important).  Perhaps helping on this is a plan of what to do when you're up.  Each month, take a percentage of your winning trades and move it toward those longer term goals with a less risky investment strategy (and make quarterly estimated tax payments).

Regardless, you're doing well financially and seem happy in your marriage.  Congrats on the double win.

That’s because you’re looking at share prices instead of market caps. Sure stocks like Norwegian cruise, JetBlue (jsit to name some of top of my head but it isn’t constraint to travel only) are below their Feb share prices but their market caps are already well above their Feb levels since they have been issuing shares throughout the insane rally as they recognized the idiotecy of it and took advantage.

$24—>$460 more like 20X, but not all of that was the squeeze. You gotta look at when the story changed and shorts capitulated. Short squeezes have a violent and a long term component.

It still does not matter. Because both senate seats are up for grabs in Georgia. Moreover, what are  people gonna take their money out of the stock market because the fed can’t print money and leave it in a savings account with 0% interest. I think not.

However possible short term correction is likely at some point.

What strike you looking at
The problem is that the death rate would be higher if we let the virus run its course.  All the ICU beds would fill up and then we’d end up with 1/100 or more of the population dying from COVID, plus every other thing that requires a hospital visit normally could be a death sentence.  With that many deaths, it’d threaten the stability of society
Its never ending cycle
It's a gym that is geared for non-meatheads.  No hot girls ever at any locations.  All fat and ugly. Very bad.  Very very bad.
true, I literally make decisions on buying/selling stocks in seconds (since I don't do options anymore, that shit hit me hard in September) worth of \~$20k, but this Friday I was walking across Soda aisle at Harris Teeter for 15 minutes unable to decide whether  to buy Coca-Cola ($2.19) for whiskey or buy store brand cola for $0.59.

It’s always been priced in
I’m aware, I got in pre 16$ so I’m already printing some tendies. But can’t tell if the best that could come will outweigh the worst + time opportunity
I bought it at 14 and sold at 25 I think. 300 shares. I honestly can't find enough info to say anything on the company. Maybe your right. I ate shit on my 30c and 27c but they were monthlys but man I was so close lol.
 VLDR is the better company IMO. I think lazr just gets more of the hype because of the ticker. But I am sure there is money to be made from both. 
My only position atm is VLDR 20c 1/15
1. Become a BAML client 
2. have a subscription to Bloomberg and can see the day-to-day changes in the Bear/Bull Index
Or a wage system that doesn’t increase as inflation builds up... it goes up with the rate of inflation making shitheads think they’re making more money when they’re not.

I have 1/15/21 17c and up 10,000% but I was a bitch and only got 4 contracts. BUT I see it going to $25 by June 2021 and thinking about buying shit ton of those calls for $37 a contract. Thoughts?
All the good lookin bitches finna get healed
Are those naked calls?
yep new all time highs this week, bears will be caught out again!
even then it's not a problem until you can't afford it
So market can price full recovery that is expected late into next year and for some industries into 2023 but somehow Fed closing facilities in 10 days won’t be priced in for a while.
Normally I wouldn't of traded it this aggressive.  Friday was just a crazy day in the last hour.
People complain when Tesla is compared to car companies because it's a "tech" company. And here we are complaining about Tesla being compared to a tech company. I think the point of this parallel is not what type of company it is, but the valuation.
Why’s that?

After a certain amount of income, money starts to detach from happiness and the sense of security.  I think after I started making more than 90k in general I was already at my "peak happiness" with respect to income.  I make about 130k now after getting another 20k raise this year but honestly money stopped mattering as much when I no longer needed anymore.  I grew up poor so it is a bit of an existential crisis truthfully.  I grew up always being short on money and having a huge drive to hustle to survive.  Now I don't really know what to do given that I've reached what I thought was the key to happiness and discovered in no surprise it wasn't.

Trading is more about the satisfaction in knowing I'm getting proved right in my predictions now.  a vain sort of "I-told-you-so" to no one in particular.  It's more of a game and the returns and losses have nothing to do with the absolute value of dollars as I treat it purely % based.  If I had a million to trade I'd be trading 50,000 on 1 or 2 options as I usually leave 5% for that.  But the huge plays only seem impressive when you need that much money.  If you don't then it doesn't really have any ramifications on tomorrow.
Aha, I knew it!
EOD.
Do you think now that the delisting  bill signed it will drop the price again of Nio cause of the dumb sellers? Think that's priced in & nothing to worry about for Monday?
Stimulus passing is already priced in. It might cause a little bump in futures and at market open on Monday morning but that’s about it.
That morning where they started the printer wiped me out. I remember we were down like 6% premarket Monday. Then they announced the printer (unlimited QE) at like 8:30am and we were up 10% by open. 

I had spy puts that I paid 100k for that went ITM and were worth about 700k going into monday morning. I was planning to unload as soon as market opened, but because of the unlimited QE 8:30am spike they were worthless by open at 9:30. I've never lost more in an hour and I've never been that close to $rope. I went from picking my lambo color to picking up cans in a matter of minutes.
Yeah the new board member was great news. Also the military contract for halolens has me thinking the AR vertical well be sold soon. Been in this since the dude bought a halolens just to take it apart and prove the tech is in there. Over 1000 shares here and a few now deep itm calls for February

None of the polling showed it was that close. If Republicans knew ahead of time it would be that close I'm sure they would have passed it.

I don't understand this Steam fantasy. Why wouldn't you just buy games directly from Microsoft or Sony? What is being like Steam supposed to accomplish? 

I think the future of Gamestop is still physical games. People will still buy physical games over digital games (as long as the option is there) because it gives them the ability to resell. Gamestop will **NEVER** go back to its previous revenue high's without its resale business.
I mean if you have debt and inflation proof assets like equity or property or art etc, then inflation isn't bad. If you have cash it's bad.

You’re joking
Exactly, the problem seems to be people thinking that somehow someone will be able to make cars cheaper than the materials required. Tesla cannot make much more profit than other car makers at scale. Mass consumers are much more price sensitive than rich tech bros. The math just doesn’t add up. The money isn’t out there for Tesla to make unless they somehow start mining asteroids for cheaper metal.

Right now it's basically a ponzi scheme but it works because the Fed can buy endlessly to outlast downturns. Passing this would be shutting down the buyers in the ponzi scheme. We might be ok for awhile but the next crisis would be catastrophic.

You hedge against your sold calls by buying shares (as a collateral) so that if they end up expiring ITM you give them up.

You hedge against your sold puts by having cash, not by fucking shorting the stock

This stock is dead. The problem is SWI is now going to get sued heavily and also hurt papa government.  You don't do the latter unless you want to get killed. Companies are going to migrate away from SWI in the interm while they evaluate the damage.  Once that is known, they will then sue SWI to recover the damages and I doubt SWI fcf can afford these.

Guys i may or may not have bought FEYE at the top 😂
Make sure to save some to make a matching toilet seat cover

The right answer
My account is nothing but wash sales.  Lol.  If you make money total on a stock it doesn't matter as much. If all I did was lose in tsla for 30 days then it could screw me.
Well done, if you’ve lived through a couple bubbles you know this is unsustainable.  It’s getting exhausting now discussing Tesla’s valuation, it’s true that it is a once in a generation stock, and theyve killed it the past year, but I see a failing solar biz, and a niche product that’s nice but I don’t think will ever be fully mainstream, especially given competition and people’s willingness to want to be different when it comes to vehicles.

People wanna compare Telsa to software companies that make 30% profit margin like Microsoft.  “It’s not just a car company!” But they still produce a physical product and its hard as fuck to make a profit in manufacturing.  There’s raw materials costs, labor, plant, transportation, etc.  Like you said, at best they do 6% profit but that will probably never happen, probably more like 2%, so if they have a couple of flat to low growth quarters, look out below, even killing earnings could tank it at this point.  The thing about biz it’s always the same and eventually a company has to trade in reality, of course on the short side it’s about timing, but I have to think this is gonna end badly for people buying at these levels, possibly as soon as the next ER.  

Best thing people can do, if they believe in it is hold some shares but take some profits and diversify.
I'm a dude right now, but it doesn't have to be that way forever

If you can keep buying in, theoretically, you can make a fortune in a dump. I did this in September with hedges and covered my ass but Jesus it was fuking stressful. I was dead flat-to-red on calls for weeks bc I was hemorrhaging on spy puts, sqqq, etc.  I netted 8k thanks to puts during the dump when the rest of my portfolio was tanking. Overall not worth it. I would have averaged out about the same without the stress of big hedges. Now I buy SPXS calls which are cheap af and can cover 100k in positions with 2k in SPXS calls.
You got any sources on that or are you just pulling it out your ass?

Also, did you just assume that the reason GME has SI this high is because somebody sold puts and wanted to hedge against it? Thats fucking moronic, infinity loss hedge for a limited loss position
Pretty much but instead of bread crumbs...it's tendies.

Day trading is a bad deal. Tesla rallied so hard Friday if you simply held you position you would have a made so much more. Plus you wouldn’t have to put in all the effort and pay all the crazy fees if you use a real platform.
Of course, but if GME does become a market leader in the gaming industry + factoring in the growth of the gaming sector, that isn't such an impossible valuation.

I'm not saying this WILL happen, but I'm speculating based on numbers that would be realistic if they turn their business around.

Vega is always higher on longer dated options. IV is going to be all over the place (but probably ultimately slowly fall). If you are bullish but want to be short volatility (betting volatility also goes down), look into calendar spreads or diagonal spreads. Both can take advantage of low or high IV depending on how you set it up

Year 10 was 1/10 of your life

Maybe go back and determine what the threshold is for each individual stock to be considered "mooning". Ie. Stock x is considered mooning @+2% given its daily trading history and stock y is mooning @+5%. Making that dynamic could potentially help your model long term

I started winter 2018 right before China talks going bad drop. Lost my ass, learned some things. Now I laugh at myself back then. Keep some stocks to offset options. It helps you watch certain tickers more closely. I’m up almost 200% this year. Not the best, but better than I was. Like others said, keep yourself in the game. That is rule #1

That’s literally the entire point of the stimulus. Theoretically it benefits you too.
If you take into account that it took a cliff dive after it opened, it's actually up 19.5% since the end of October. 20% in 1.5 mo is pretty good, especially if were buying calls that are 16% OTM for 6 months out... at that rate could see 80% gains before expiry. Plus if we get a stimmy passed... 💰🤑
Most alleged capitalists in this country do not have sufficient assets to live on the performance of those assets. 

A simple way to determine if you are a capitalist is if you could live for a year on your assets alone without having to spend your principal. If the answer is no, then you are a wage earner and should not be supporting policy to damage the rights of wage earners. To support capitalism (which in the United States is really just shorthand for eliminating all taxes) before you have reached the point I mentioned above means you will have a harder time reaching it because the goal is to keep the club as small as possible.
Everyone talking about the dividend yield keep in mind 7.48% on your $200 position is less than $15/year
Since you’ve known this girl, find yourself around her sometimes. But not clingy. Use that previous encounter as confidence, not as making things weird.

I have my own business and have several six figure + accounts I invest with. I can’t speak for anyone else here but I don’t do naked options on stocks like Tesla even though I can afford it. I use call debit spreads. I can stand losing big on these because the have asymmetric risk. Basically every spread i do is risk 100 to win 300. If I lose on 2 and win 1 I’m still up.  I think that’s the secret to options.
If this is true they will just adjust the mRNA vaccine and send it through the fastest approval process in history. The neat thing about mRNA vaccines is they are fully designed in a computer then "printed out" in a lab. It can be modified on the fly.

The current progressive members of Congress are actually the only fiscal conservatives in the building. 

Contrary to popular belief, they don't want to give anything away for free. They would like to raise taxes to fund programs with today money instead of tomorrow growth promises. 

Neoliberalism is a failed governing philosophy. The search for cheap labor to fuel unregulated capitalism has brought us to this inflection point in history.

I remember thinking "why on earth would Nancy get forced to the last minute then hand Trump a huge victory right before the election"

That election was so close that Trumpchecks could have made the difference.

Only thing I can't quite grasp is why republicans didn't jump at the 2.2 trillion. Yeah, it's way more than they want to spend but it may have made the difference for Trump AND the Senate. Democrats even passed a bill, all republicans in the senate had to do was vote for it.

Imperceptible to the human eye

That’s my understanding as well. But I’d be shocked if the GOP doesn’t become the ‘fiscal responsibility party’ again once Trump is gone. This move essentially allows the GOP in Congress to hinder the recovery efforts in a Dem administration. So it may be green this week, but it’ll be much easier for them to cut off the programs after Jan 20.

The problem is most people moving into nursing homes don’t exactly have a choice. They need constant looking after, forget everything, often can’t walk,  and would die without regular attention. So your choices are either nursing home or getting a private live in nurse. You can’t expect your family to be able to do it as they often lack any medical skill and can’t be in the house at all times, people have work.

Do you think Neuralink was discovered by accident?
Hmm thx
Trump should be well respected here. He is the ultimate wall street bettor. 

He got hugely leveraged commercial real estate properties. They tanked in value during the early & mid 90s. He refinanced all his loans and somehow kept the leverage and became wealthier than before. 

It's like the equivalent of getting margin called and convincing robinhood to give you more margin and coming all the way back and more

Funnily enough that thread is what I was thinking of haha. Think two of the comments were this actually, which is hilarious because there was only like 8 comments at the time.
I don't want to though 🤡
I asked my wife, and she said she'd be happy. If you told her you lost 2 million bucks, then she'd be pissed.

However, if you made her work minimum wage jobs for the past 10 years while saving 700k on the side, she'd be pissed over that.

There was a case in SK where a guy in Starbucks spread it to every single person who was on the same floor. Even people that went up there for 2mins. The staff were the only ones not to get sick even though they went up to clean multiple times. They had N95’s on.

I think a lot more people here know where you're coming from than you realize. I'd wager most of us have a "real" portfolio that is much more r/investing approved, but since we like stocks and enjoy this stuff we allocate a small percentage for a "fun" account. WSB is where we talk about that account's plays. 

It's the flashy big gains and epic losses that are worth posting so that's what you see rise to the top. But there are also plenty of farewell posts from people who have lost large sums and realize chasing those losses has destroyed them. There are people on here with legitimate gambling problems. It's just a little more socially acceptable to lose ten grand "in the stock market" than at the craps table or on a prop bet of an NFL game.

The caviler YOLO attitude is a bit of a schtick that gets played up IMO. But there are definitely some young'uns with lofty tech salaries and no familial expenses who throw crazy amounts at retarded plays like it's nothing. And to an extent, from what I've gathered here, to them it is nothing; it's just a number on a screen, 1s and 0s.

Now, if I were to hit a grand slam with some dumb move I read about on here and made a huge gain, I would definitely be sending a large portion of that to my checking account immediately and paying down the mortgage with it. But that's just where I am in my life. These crazy kids in their 20s with no real responsibilities can afford to try and turn that big gain into a *MASSIVE* gain, and if they do and end up a millionaire by 30 then more power to them. No matter if they succeed or fail it's certainly fun to watch.

QE pushes interest rates down, pushing more money into the stock market and more money into consumers hands. 

When QE ends, interest rates likely come up, stock market may come down and instead of inflation, we may see some deflation.

That being said- the market is likely to overreact then correct.
Preferably Friday but if there's a pullback I'll wait for the run up on Monday.

This is a similar pattern as Theranos. Lots of accomplished people invested, but no professional VCs 

2. QS CEO has a great track record in the semicon space, but no experience in batteries and materials 

3. VW invested because, a top VW exec works in the lab of the QS founder (Prof Prinz)

4. Yes there is still a chance of QS working.. And the return could be huge. 

5. There are many direct competitors and indirect.

6. Market size is less than their current market cap

>"In a 1988 editorial in Public Gaming International, Markowicz wrote that he envisioned a bright future for American lotteries thanks to corporate centralization as well as the declining number of self-employed Americans.

In spite of the fact that **people have good opportunities for advancement**, they are **unable to to take the kind of quantum jumps that were available in the past**. So disposable income has been going up, just as the **big dream of opportunities have been going narrowing down**. Everybody needs a **dream.

I have a total net worth of roughly 10m.  5m of that is delegated to investing.  3m professionally managed, 2m I manage myself - though I started that account with $12k a fair number of years back.  The other 5m is in properties, retirement accounts, and cash bank accounts.

I also have a few vacation rentals in Pattaya Thailand, a house in provincial Philippines, and will break ground on a new house in the Philippines that by square footage is considered a “mansion” - though will be using bank financing to build - total cost of property and build will come in around 1m.

No I didn’t inherit any money though my parents have put their assets into a trust for my sister and I when they pass away in maybe 10-20 years I guess.

Not everybody gets fulfillment from such grand ideals. Not everybody is blessed to have the capacity to actually do the things you state. Nor do they have to do such things to live a happy, fulfilling life. 

I'm not saying you can derive happiness or fulfillment from such things-- it just is not for everybody. Some people are content with living in their own world at their own pace and that is more than okay. It's their fucking lives.

"priced in" is a fucking joke.

Maybe rumors and news are partially priced in but they're never fully priced in. Even supposedly "sophisticated" investors do not seem to understand basic things either. How many times did we see Wall Street get yoyoed by "more stimulus!" Anyone who knew how politics worked at even a basic level knew that it wasn't going to happen the way they thought it would. So what was even priced in then? The ignorant non-understanding of politics? 

"Priced in" is mostly a lie people tell themselves.

If you think nobody will catch up to Tesla , you’re a fool
Exactly, every major dip over the past few years has gotten bought up immediately so nobody is worried about them. There’s definitely a time element to it where you have to build up major confidence in people so nobody fears dips and now it’s hard to imagine what would really scare the market. But there’s always a sentiment reset you just have to try and figure out what that would look like. When people are happy to have a perfectly timed 10% correction then there’s no chance that’s going to reset sentiment. I think people are expecting a quick correction early in the year because that’s what happened in 2018. Problem with that is that nobody expected any sort of correction then so it completely caught the market offsides and scared the living shit out of people.

Nah I’m just holding them, not selling calls. I may do long spreads on them though if they keep going up the way they are. ARKF would probably be a good one to do that on
Anddd we’re fucked. Remember that the markets started dropping when Italy started panicking in March. 

Expect a large second drop with current events in the UK. Several European countries are planning to stop visitors from the UK.

What is Elon trying to tell us?
Do you guys sell your covered calls Friday before close or Monday at open?
Not just the trucks. Vans are the next layer. A surprising number of businesses use cargo vans, and they buy in bulk.
Robinhood isn't gambling. Robinhood just provides a service to investing on Wall Street, the actual gambling is our devotion to supply side economics which is the original, STONKS ONLY GO UP 🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀🚀

Correlation also says an increase in ice cream sales results in more shark attacks. You’re looking for causation. 🤡
Sell TSLA cc FDs at open?
Fuk yeah
And more likely to funnel it into Robinhood accounts.  There’s so much upside.
What is interesting is that if you look at the percentage of people who purchase gambling products, those with lower incomes spend a higher proportion of their income on gambling products than the wealthy. The proportion increases if their income comes from a source of welfare, followed by people who earn paychecks. You know who spends the lowest proportion of their income on gambling, but it seems like it's more numerically? People who have earned their income through investments such as real estate, bonds, stocks etc.  If Jeff Bezos gambles a million that a drop in the bucket, but a man who earns $25,000 a year gambles $5000 annually, that's 20% of his income.
I’ve been working throughout the pandemic as a front line healthcare worker. I don’t need a stimulus check. Blanket checks are a bad idea and fiscally wreckless.

You should watch more movies. Edgar Wright and Wes Anderson have made great comedies, definitely better then this one
predictions for TSLA tmrw go:
Of course and lingonberry sauce to boot
new rona may keep it inflated for a bit
Still not sure of the benefit? By the time this list gets updated they could be in and out of their call option?
This is the most autistic shit I’ve seen in a long time and that’s saying something

Bought BTI calls at market close Friday.  Moon tomorrow please.
It's a relatively easy play for me. Sell on q4 earnings. If cohen is a part of the picture by then I'll hold
Today is premarket Monday lol
That would be very cash money if I do say so myself
The House can probably pass it.  The Senate will probably spill over to Monday.

But what happens after the virus is gone?
Start selling puts then
This is the closest thing to free money...MMs will pump it up for a few days to scare retail away, but after that it’s puts until it’s below 100
They’re not gonna pass jack shit are they 😐😐
No
I was out after losing some aapl calls in October after buying a dip after an event and hoping for a run up to earnings. Stayed flat. I’ve been back for 2 weeks now.
401k is maxed out. Of the rest I put into my portfolio, about 1/4 of that is in highly risky activity. It has very little bearing on my actual long term financial well being, unless I win.

It’s been less than a month. There’s zero actual research that supports that a new strain is more viral than the original. They’re not sequencing every positive test. This is just fear mongering to sell advertisement views. You got played.

better yet, find a pretty CPA, explain to her that you want her to do your taxes, and bring her to your house to help explain the taxes to your wife. Make sure you bring her over when your wife isn't around so your wife gets home and sees you both talking. This way, you don't have to explain who she is right away.

Then start the conversation to your wife with "I have started seeing <insert lady's name>, and i have some news for you"

it does not appear to pay a dividend, or make distributions. it is a new ETF and doesn't have a long track record. that's why I only bought one call.

I mean, my country Canada is mostly locked down and most countries still are regardless of a new strain or not. Scientists can confirm a new strain and report it to the politicians, and the politicians use that information to make a lockdown seem more sensible to people when most of the world is already still locked down.

There’s probably hundreds of strains, a mutation is normal as fuck this is fear mongering

Forex is a multi level marketing scam for most people  joining trading groups. if you actually seriously trade forex the percent returned is so marginal that you need to leverage your account to actually see any meaningful profits. Would rather stick to options cause 200% is way better than 2%
PLTR
if Tesla's momentum is based off EV sales, then they'll be dropping off really quickly. Too many new and old players invading the space. Not to mention that EVs last year accounted for only like 2-3% of total vehicle sales, so if a market for EV were really rising (which it is), their market share dominance is not as important at this point.

Look, I'm just telling you that the instant something better comes along, the government is picking it up.  It doesn't mean they'll quit using PLTR immediately, especially if they have to learn a new software suite, but they *will* pick up the new one.  They don't allow gaps like that to form in intel.  It's the one place in the U.S. government that isn't afraid to always be on the leading edge.  In fact it's necessary to even function.  If any MIT grad or some shit, ever writes a better A.I. and they decide to form their own company as opposed to selling it to PLTR, then PLTR's days are numbered from that point on.

Well, a "compromise" was reached last night regarding Toomey's provision. Apparently, CARES act will end on Dec 31st. Toomey is saying he got exactly what he wanted while Democrats are saying they got less restrictive language. They can reinstate CARES option if need be pending Congressional approval but I'd put money on the fact Republicans will make that a very difficult thing to do if they keep their seats. Idk, got to do some more digging to see what the future of the Printer will be and I haven't had my ☕ yet.

They always say you’re required but I’m pretty sure you can just pay it and forfeit your claim against defending contrary position. Check online. Ohio is fukd so maybe they do require. One good thing is that Ohio is cheap af and you have a constitutional right to have an attorney appear for you. Probably some paralegal you can hire that sits in court all day dealing w out-of-state tickets. 

I’d be tempted to say fuk it. I know several doctors and academics that never pay these and have had zero problems. One had something like 7 unpaid speeding tickets in Arizona for years. He never did anything even though he got threatening letters. They finally sent a letter saying he could pay a one-time $99 fee and be excused from all tix. He told me, “fuk them, they going to come and arrest me in Michigan?”

When boomers and young teens wake up at 9 and 2pm respectively, this will pump again.
I am more than confident about this. I am loaded. I will probably suffer a loss on Monday as there’s one final pump for the rich to pile into cheap short positions.
This is the truth. I didn't start making good money until I started not being afraid of taking loses.  Keeping good money in a bad thing is a huge waste of time.

You can’t have common sense on wsb people think the markets move by patterns!
“Dow falls to end the week as congress struggles to pass coronavirus stimulus.”  More like dow falls to end the week because congress was trying to buy the dip during Friday’s power hour before magically working out their differences.
"Time in the market beats timing the market"

Every single fucking thread, usually multiple times lmao.
I’m aware but was there a stock split or something or how did it tank that hard?
Sounds like you got it all figured out. Congrats on being rich as I am sure you have loaded up on puts with all this confidence you have
That stimulus needs to pass in order to drop the market. Part of the package includes suspending the printer that is keeping this big old gypsy wagon rolling.

Don’t get me wrong I really want them to pass it. What is happening to small businesses is insane. But right, it depends what is in it but we really are running on fumes here.
Boomer alert
Dems just announced that Fed powers are preserved in new draft. Toomey aide made the comment you posted right after saying they’d cleared the last hurdle for negotiations and dem’s celebrating “victory.” These fuking clowns are the worst. Both sides. 

They have one day to get this together or it’s fukd. Any single member of congress or the WH can delay this for 2-5 days with one pen swipe. Anyone think this will actually go through with any real help to the economy? It’s getting more watered down by the minute.

It wasn't outlandish enough to qualify as comedy, it really sounds like somethingthey say.

I want to quit but my wife's boyfriend won't let me.
Its not whether $600 is a lot to people or not. The reason why you're being downvoted is because your statement "i wouldn't even notice" make you seem like a shitty individual who only asked the question in a pathetic attempt to make yourself appear better than others by making such an asinine statement.

GME Q4 2012 (1 year before ps3/xbox1 release) EPS was 2.15

Q4 2013 (including ps3/xbox1 release) EPS was 1.89, and was below 1.93 estimates. interesting that it was lower Y/Y

2014 was a good year for them though

it would be incredible if they beat 1.93 this quarter

There are so many other factors you need to control; one predicting factor will be industry ( use sic -3 digit at least). others include; firm age, dividend paying or growth stock, Asset pricing models says you need to adjust for firm size, market return based on beta, and m/b ratio. But a very good idea.

Ohio is the fuking worst for tickets. Absolute shithole state. 

Most people I know dont pay out-of-state tickets. It’s rare for a state to go after someone with one ticket in another state. They will send letters but they have no real ability or desire to act on it. If it were me, I’d just  pay the fine so you dont have to go to court. If they are really making you go, pay a cheap lawyer to appear for you and pay it.

Shorters got greedy and I'm going to profit off their stupidity and hubris in the short term. Come April, I'll reevaluate and see if their guidance passes the sniff test. Interestingly, if they do decide to revamp their business model they may need that $100M and will undoubtedly need to borrow and go back into debt (many hundreds of millions IMO). If this happen, shorters may jump back in and bet on their failure. We may see another opportunity to profit on their stupidity again in a few years or we could be the stupid ones and the cycle would come full circle.

"This agreement rescinds more than $429 billion in unused CARES Act funds; definitively ends the CARES Act lending facilities by Dec. 31, 2020, stops these facilities from being restarted, and forbids them from being duplicated without congressional approval.

TSLA once had a +15% open on Monday. We might see something special on Monday
Prove it. Send me $600
Uh, definitely not betting on that alone, or even a huge part.  They are doing the right things to make more Keon’s from current customers &&& doing the right things to get more customers.  Not hard to see why that’s a win.  


I’m way more excited about how their bronco stole 30%+ of Jeep wrangler owners from FCA. And pretty excited about their autonomous work.  I’m sure you’re not familiar with it.  But they have some interesting work going on with the curb to door segment.  And their autonomous driving systems aren’t half bad. 


The electric F-150, is not proof that they are going to the moon.  It is proof that they aren’t screening up their gold mine, or ignoring trends that will make them obsolete if they do nothing.

Both sides claiming victory but Fed still handicapped in current draft. Statement by Toomey aide:

“This agreement rescinds more than $429 billion in unused CARES Act funds; definitively ends the CARES Act lending facilities by December 31, 2020; stops these facilities from being restarted; and forbids them from being duplicated without congressional approval," Toomey spokesman Steve Kelly said in a statement. "This agreement will preserve Fed independence and prevent Democrats from hijacking these programs for political and social policy purposes."
F u
Dems control House, Repubs control Senate, Senate + House = Congress. 

People aren't talking about QE when they're talking stimulus, unless "monetary stimulus" is the phrase they're using. The bill being talked about is primarily fiscal stimulus, plus these Fed restrictions and whatever other pork gets tacked on. 

As far as I'm aware, the Fed's ability to do what we think of as "standard" QE- buying treasury bonds and mortgage backed securities- remains unchanged. JPow will continue to buy hundreds of billions of dollars in bonds every month. The Fed's ability to do stuff it wasn't able to do prior to March is what might go away: lending directly to businesses and local governments, buying corporate bonds and corporate bond ETFs on the open market, etc. The corporate bond stuff might cause a shit-show in that market because everyone has been paying record-high prices to buy corporate bonds because they assume the Fed will step in if anything goes tits up. If the Fed can't step in anymore the "safe bet" isn't so safe anymore. But the bond market is super complicated and how it interacts with the stock market is even less clear to me so who the hell knows.
I think there’s some statistic that lots of American can’t cover a $1,000 emergency or something
These guys dont know what theyre talking about lol. Anyone that says an \*ETF\* that went up 12% in a month is slow moving loses all credibility from me. On a normal year 12% a year is considered good
Lol
Without any of you getting butthurt for embarrassingly ideological reasons, on the one percent chance that trump acts on that executive order against election fraud he signed a little while back, markets will poop themselves for a minute right?
I concur
honestly TSLA put premiums being SO MUCH higher than TSLA calls rn is bearish enough to convince me to go all in shorting it at open monday
Not if you adjust your discount rate. Traditional DCFs no longer apply
Yes.
Feds can still provide emergency loans.That’s the most important thing during a economic crisis.

Yo meet me at falador bank I got a free d scim
What FD’s are y’all all getting with our stimmy
That's fair. I had the same opinion back in May, when it was around $4. Then the Ryan Cohen thing and Microsoft deal came along and I still see risk, but it's a risk I'm willing to take because it seems quite likely at this point.
I dont normally go for WSB DD but this is actually pretty legit. Some of my best returns lately have been calls of indexes and ETFs like $HERO and $IPO. Im going in on a call purchase come Monday.

You’re scalping. Very normal. Don’t doubt.
I just made 35k on 0dte puts Friday and you wanna go long?? Good luck w that.
Benelli m1014 should do the trick
Having a hard time finding the text of the compromise the senate agreed on regarding the Feds lending programs. If I’m understanding the compromise correctly, the senate agreed that the 450 billion mnuchin took away from the fed still requires congressional approval but the fed is free to start similar programs in the future without congressional approval so long as it has approval from the treasury.

thanks, ill have to look into this. whats stopping people who have millions from just buying a bit of every single stock available?
So if it's genuinely WSB then we should fade this and buy puts? Seeing were all retards here

I’ve got a shitty job. I can lose everything in my account and I’d still have the shitty job. If I lose the shitty job, i can hop on my savings before I start to liquidate my trading accounts. Only time I’m  truly fucked is if I lose both and also run thru savings (1 yr expenses). It makes taking risks very manageable.

In the past, I’ve Yolo’ed my net worth and lost. I’ve started multiple businesses and failed. But it never really mattered because I’m single, I can always find a shitty job, build up some capital and try again.

ballers ETFs (ARK, clean energy) & sell calls? Am I hearing you right? 

I’m just too poor to do the ARKs unfortunately
I realised I ran out of letters and have to started from the beginning of the alphabet
My dream is to make enough to trade for a living. If I can get up to 600k and get a 10% annual return I could live of 60k next and everything over that would go back into my brokerage. In theory my salary would go up every year because I'll beat 10% a year. I'd start an LLC for tax purposes, and live that sweet expat life somewhere cheap
I just think about all the people in the past, throughout our entire planet's history, who must have had these same thoughts only for them to live out the rest of their lives the only way they knew how to then eventually find their grave. The more I look at it this way the more I realize that we really are supposed to die. Just as natural as growing grey hair as we age. I feel this life is just the appetizer for what is really to come (eternity) whether there is a God or not. I truly believe the universe is our play ground but we only get to experience so much of it at a life-time.

I expect it to drop 3 days after Q4 earnings are released when the share lock-up period ends and 1.8 billion shares are allowed to flood the market. It doesn’t mean that every early investor necessarily will sell, as I am sure many see a further upside. But they can. What would you do if you invested in PLTR 17 years ago and it’s now worth 300% its initial IPO? Plan accordingly. Refer to NKLA chart for reference.

On tastyworks you have to explicitly tell risk management you’re monitoring 0dte, otherwise they’ll close them for you.

That's really interesting. I have so many questions now.  Wouldn't there be a huge risk of backlash from it? Half of the American population still believes weed is a tool of the devil, waiting for an opportunity to introduce their kids to crack cocaine and meth. And rice krispies were invented to discourage young boys from playing with their willie after all. 

Also, what about the regulatory aspects? Would it be classified as a food supplement,  ingredient or pharmaceutical? Also, there's potential liability as long term safety studies about edible cannabis products are scarce.

Do I have to spell this out for you...first off, full self driving cars are nowhere near commercial use. And won’t be for a long time. Not while the current infrastructure of roads are the way they are. So, that means Tesla will be a cool car company making cars... not only that, it’s an insanely competitive market. With player with huge pockets. The battery technology from Bosch and Toyota is already better than Tesla technology. You just don’t know what you’re talking about, it’s really okay.
Lol there’s no secret formula. I used to be up 300% all time now I’m down 75% all time. Trick is don’t go all in and then wait for a pullback down to a major support zone. Then buy buy buy contracts a few months out. Then wait and profit
I hold 99% shares and run a couple ( 3-5 ) options every now and then. I don’t always have time to be staring at the prices

Dude...listen to yourself. A full self driving car is something i didnt think was even possible last year. It didnt exist. Think about that for a second. A car that can drive itself...
I think about it a lot late at night/ early in the morning. Weird to think life will come and go and nobody will ever know you existed in 100-200 years. One day you are living and the next day just blackness forever
They could be, yes, but it's hard to tell. So some options may not represent what they really think the market will do.
Of course, they may ONLY have options but without you knowing, it can be a risky strategy. When they 'lose' you don't know if it's poor judgement, or they made the money elsewhere.

those commodity businesses have insane cycles though. They make good money after those industries just give up investing because the future looks so miserable, and jut like that they pave the path for future profitability when they later find out that all the demand just cant be met and they make money hand over fist, invest & expand too much, and swing the pendelum the other way around.

HAHAHAHAH...NO YOU WOULD NOT. It’s a bubble...how can you not see that. People got caught short all the way up and now you see it peaking. That is all that’s happening.
Yup, it's the simplest solution to prevent scalpers. It is more inconvenient than ordering online, but at least you know you will get one, instead of constantly seeing "out of stock" on a website

Yo I dont have a refractory period. I can keep coming non stop without stopping. I swear to god I just emasculated 15 times no stopping. I only stopped because I got scared of maybe something coild go wrong. As they say,, too much of nothing is good.

Lol... no man. These are just paper gains. Every bubble deflates.
The audience for this game gets too old for it and leaves every day. I can't imagine it continuing to be profitable even though it's been a household name for a long while. Imagine trying to impress your 8 year old with some robux for Christmas because he's been whining about it for months but he replies "roblox? Oh thanks dad, that was cool a week ago.." and your wife doesn't even let you watch her fuck that night.

> I actually have a "side hustle" that makes 10 mio/year in net profits, we can now do whatever the fuck we want.

There is another possibility, they would say they have a side hustle making $10m a year in profits, and that's it, they don't give it out. Kind of a dick move if the friends/family are struggling, but if everyone's doing ok, I don't know if I could really be angry at someone because they aren't just giving me their money.

Of course, I would probably become envious and bitter after a while, but more at my own paper hands and retard yolos.

Can I ask if anyone feels there is any benefit to this?  
I am been given alerts to large volume option buys signals and trying to work out the benefit of this. I was told if I just copy the buys then it's a sure way to make money (the big buys are by people who know what they're doing). e.g I'll get an alert saying X calls bought in Y company ending Z date at A strike price.

>Why do people say that Tesla is a tech company that makes cars? No they’re a car company that makes cars. And their battery technology is not even world class compared to Toyota and other OEM’s. There’s many other companies that have more superior battery technology. It really is just crazy to think they’re worth more than all the other car manufacturers combined. While there might be other avenues to profit down the line, it’s a car company making cars right now...

You don't think the massive lead on self-driving cars validates a tech valuation despite possibly supplanting Uber and similar companies? Don't get me wrong, the valuation is insane (and likely will continue to be), but it's definitely more than just a car company.

How about you do some research and not just the typical soundbite. There are tons of companies with more superior battery technology. Toyota has a battery with a much farther range.

lol tell her you have a tax liability of roughly 600k (and don't tell her you did not realize you had to send in quarterly estimates and now its 650k)

"you guys know nothing about the type of people that buy this vehicle"

Imagine thinking people buy this vehicle for themselves, and then to tell others they know nothing about who buys this vehicle. Comical.

 Almost 40% of Fords *total* sales are fleet sales. The vast majority of that comes from the F150 and Transit sales. In 2019 it was estimated that the fleet cost of the electric F150 will be half that of the gas powered v6 ecoboost. If you can't quite figure out what that means, it means that every corporate fleet buyer will get a flyer that let's them know that next year they can get two trucks for the price of one, if they switch to electric. IMO buyers do enjoy saving money, especially when it doesn't affect them at all.

This is a truck that made a full switch to aluminum (a much more drastic change for a work truck if you ask me) and saw little to no impact in sales. This truck cuts your cost in half and you have 100% of your torque available the second you touch the pedal. That's a work truck.

I can't tell you that this means Ford stock will jump more than Tesla in 2021, but to write off the best selling vehicle in America over the past 40 years is just not smart, man.
I work from like 10am to 3pm from home. I fucking love work too. They are never getting me back into the office.

GET DOGECOIN:
There are numerous amounts of ways to get Dogecoin. You can buy them, trade for them, get tipped, "mine" them, and more. They are surprisingly endless!

You can get tipped Dogecoin by participating in our community. If that's not your style, the easiest way to have your first Dogecoin is to get them from a faucet.

A Faucet is a website which gives you a small amount of Dogecoin for free to introduce you to the currency! All you need is your Dogecoin address.

Here are a couple Dogecoin faucets:

Dogefaucet.com - Enter your address to get free Dogecoin.
InDogeWeTrust.com - Same as Dogefaucet.
You can also get Dogecoin by "mining" it. Mining is when you use your computer to process Dogecoin transactions by other people, and in return you get Dogecoin.

Mining is intended for advanced users only, as it requires a lot of technical knowledge to do. If you are interested, read more here.

No one neutered the Feds. Read articles, don’t just go by headlines. All it says is that Feds will require Congressional approval to start any similar lending program.
Vegan is dead it was a huge fad from 2016 and then everyone who was a “vegan influencer” said it was making their hair fall out and they switched to carnivore diet. Because those people wanted attention, and will never just eat normal food. 

Beyond meat had it’s moment. But a lot of people think it’s lab-grown meat and not just soy shit. There’s a literal south park episode on how it’s ultra-processed soy mush. 

Recent studies came out saying vegans are something like 50% more likely to break a bone. It’s clearly not good for you. 

Lab-grown meat is the future, soy mush will never ever ever ever ever replace it, soy mush taste like shit and isn’t even good for you.

I work with a high schooler that told me last week she has never used the camera app on her iPhone. She takes everything in snap, saves every pic she takes and saves to her phone to post to Instagram. Snapchat is the camera app of the future.
I read reports that stated “a deal is in sight and should be approved in the next 24 hours” every single day this past week. Ain’t shit approved til it’s approved

Yeah, Microsoft would make a deal to boost their sales of xbox in a battle they are losing against PS5 so that afterwards they could limit their xbox supply to GameStop. Flawless logic

The real nightmare is if you slept past the squeeze and it dropped back down to like $5/share
hmm. I'm not sure if it was one of the bots if it was a three day. I think they only hand out 1, 2, and 4 for egregious emoji spam, although I seem to have fucked something up because there's still plenty of egregious emoji spam.
This has already been the case. If you weren't buying like CRAZY during March, you missed out on MILLIONS.
Just because something sells off after a rally doesn’t mean it won’t go back up beyond the selloff point in the future. I made money off PLTR and got out before the pullback, though the number it will land at is a complete guess. If you believe in it and you’ve done enough research to feel confident in the decision, pull the trigger. But there are thousands of other plays to be made that may yield better results.

Don’t be part of the flock, and if you do decide to be part of it, be early and go hard.

It’s a great pick, as long as clean energy does well. We’re at a point, though where desperate measures are going to be taken fast and there will always be stars to harness solar power. Even off earth

It's not a bad idea, but from what I understand they are really pricey right now, for obvious reasons. It's the most popular short, and the one that has cost people the most this year, or at least that's where it was last I read about it.

Rona ain't ever going away, is it?
Meh, I would say Tesla was the first to do them good enough. I don't think we've seen EV done right yet.
Undisclosed is the percentage of the cut. The fact stays. As to why - I assume because PS5 is vastly superior so it would only be logical to create an incentive for the biggest video game retailer to sell more xboxes to at least stand a chance of competing
Such is life we are given so precious so surreal but life
To me life is over at 60-70, everything going to hurt and i can't do shit anymore
Because the shorts don't wanna lose money, that's why they keep shorting it and constantly push sloppy hit pieces to drive and keep the price down as low as possible. Price manipulation is as apparent as it can be with GME.  


I agree, our tiny dick portfolio's aren't worth crap, yet the stock has been moving up for the better part of 2020, with our without us. Massive TSLA short positions have been a thing at one point too, and look where that got them... I'm not comparing GME to TSLA, not at all, just saying that SI isn't always related to how the stock does in the future.  


As much as market is irrationally bullish at times, it can also be irrationally bearish. In the end, it doesn't even matter how you interpret the data, as long as GME keeps going up, which it seems like it will.

Intentional or not, covid has definitely been a smear campaign on nursing homes for anyone thinking about moving into one (or moving someone into one more likely). And rightfully fucking so, some of these nursing homes are just atrocious places to spend out your last days. God bless the workers but we know all know they don't get the cream of the crop nurses, and administration usually fucks them into quitting. It's fucked. Fuck covid but I was happy to see a spotlight get shone on how shitty nursing homes can be.

And don't even get me started on their fucking price.
How many?

How often do any of you think about your eventual death? Not in a suicidal way, but just the end of the line, mortality aspect of things. I'm 30 now and my parents are getting up there in age, and I find myself thinking about what those final days/weeks are like on your deathbed knowing the deep sleep is coming. Sometimes when I think about it I feel confident and content, and sometimes when I think about it I'm horrified.
Weekends are boring for degens 😢
Damn, def seems like a good pick. I’m sorting out some picks for Monday morning. This one seems like a good long term as well. Now honestly what’s up with the PLTR stuff? I’m ethical kinda iffy, but I get it. Worth it? I’m just looking at a new presidency, and these things change quick. Especially when all your money and contracts are from the government alone. I am a contracted IT employee, that gets payed by the government. So for me I know how up and down it can go.

 If you have a long term investment horizon Tesla is a great buy and hold.

But the current price might still be too fucking high. MSFT in 2000 was also a great buy and hold if you held it for 15 fucking years to break even.

Buying calls in March was a once in a lifetime opportunity.

Why do you think the sentiment is bullish? Don't mistake our retarded wsb's sentiment with our tiny dicks portfolios as an overall market's. A stock simple can't have 128% of SI when market as a whole is bullish on it

As for a gradual rise - I agree with you on that, the squeeze itself probably won't be as violent as with VW, it's unlikely we'd have a similar catalyst.
Well, if stimmy doesn't pass you will be rich on Monday. I would trim a bit if that happens because IV will spike.

Every chart I pull up looks absolutely ridiculous on the 20 year chart. Even ETF’s... parabolic on every chart starting after March. All charts look so ridiculous, they all go from nice slight upwards movement with healthy pullbacks to straight vertical. Doesn’t matter if you are looking up small cap, mid cap, large cap...doesn’t matter. Everything is up 200-300% off the March lows. And 100% off the 2020 pre COVID levels. It’s crazy action lol, just keep riding until it stops.

I want it to happen, just to get rid of the idiots simping for Cathie Wood.
Google came up with a better algorithm than anyone else. Once it became fully adopted, this exhibited network effects and spilt over to browser and other things, more data became more power in form of ads and revenue and cycle went on.

But having a great search engine is totally different than having a great AI in autonomous driving system: even if TSLA has the greatest product by far my question is that if AI constantly needs to get updated with more data, then at what point does it become 100% safe to use? Targeting ads with better AI understanding is one thing, carrying lives on AI understanding is another. So shouldnt we have some infliction point where we can assume FSD is 100% safe.and once we reach that point, how difficult it is for others to get there - if the task becomes from getting point A to B safely. Because if we constantly need data to make it “better”, how can we assume that the older version was safe to begin with. This is no ad targeting, this can be life and death.

And as i mentioned before, having superior tech does not always mean you can monetize it to the fully fullest.

But isnt this the whole argument of the topic? All im saying is as if we have already attributed all these things, all these monopolistic revenues to Tesla today and price the stock accordingly.
It can be big or not. Do we know?

> GME doesnt have to go bankrupt "soon" to be a bad investment.

Yes it does. Right now not going bankrupt is bullish for the stock price, look at their revenue and market cap ffs. Also the longer it keeps going up or stays flat - the more shorts bleed 

> Shorts can hold their positions indefinitely.

This is literlly false, why do you say that? Are you implying that somebody lended shorts their shares for free out of the goodnes of their hearts? In what fantasy land do you live?

> Holy fuck I got cancer reading that

You don't like my wording or what? Gaming is one of the fastest growing industries there is, yet dog food retailer has 40x more market cap than GameStop has

As for OTGLY (I assume you meant this not OGTLY) yes, they'll probably rebound. But just a few things: they've made a buggy piece of game that even on PC's plays worse than 7 years old GTA V, the stock doesn't have options available, their upside is not as massive as GameStop's (considering the turnaround and the highest short interest in history). I say this as a person who waited of Cyberpunk's 2077 for 7 year when only one fucking trailer was available which I watched over and over again over the years, and who will stay the game's fan anyway. I just don't mix my love for the product\company with the actual company's fundamentals

It's not low risk high reward, it's low risk low reward. I'm sure the stock will rebound, but not much higher than it did before and uncertain when will it happen. Also the company itself is pretty fairly priced, just a ballpark calculation: with a very generous 100m game purchases at $60 apiece (again generous, did not substract all the fees) gives us $6bn in revenue from this game. This is what GameStop makes already right now

I turned 8k to 58k from March and thought I knew something about something, & it took me losing another 20k since June 8th/9th to see that I’m actually worse than retarded: I’m retarded & I think I’m the diametric opposite.

>All this said, I'm not concerned that these variants will significantly reduce vaccine efficacy in the 2021 rollout. Most circulating SARS-CoV-2 viruses do not have any mutations in the spike receptor binding domain (https://nextstrain.org/ncov/global?c=gt-S_439,477,484,501…). 15/18

>Additionally, single mutations will generally have small impacts on polyclonal immune responses and the strong immune response to the mRNA vaccines would suggest that a large antigenic change would be needed to significantly reduce efficacy. 16/18


>However, we **may see modest reductions in vaccine efficacy due to antigenic drift and will likely need a process in the coming years by which we update the spike variant used in the vaccine to best match circulating viruses. 17/18


>Going forward, I suggest:
>1. Emerging variants should be assayed against sera from recovered and vaccinated individuals to test for antigenic effects
>2. Immunization records should be connected to genomic surveillance to identify variants involved in breakthrough infections

Im from the UK and I do think this new strain may not be something to fuck with. The numbers we are having with the new strain is quite alarming. In certain areas it has over taken the old strain really quickly in terms of new covid cases per day.

If the vaccine works on it, then its fine, but if not, then it would be quite a blow to market sentiment.

Markets will at least be dumping on Monday tho IMO

I hope you realize a minimum of +50% on even your most questionable calls next week.
The funny part is before 2020 this sub absolutely sucked dick at making money. If you’re an OG WSB member you’ll know this all too well. Before the TSLA Meteoric rise in 2020. This sub was nothinggggg, just a bunch of bumbling idiots gambling on weekly calls and getting absolutely wrecked. 

The only difference now is that people are buying weekly calls and we are in one of the largest blow-off tops in stock market history. QQQ and tech stocks up 46% YTD. 2nd best YTD % in recorded history only behind 1999. Plus the initial plunge in March (23 trading days) was so sharp and fast we’ve pretty much been climbing straight up since that ended. It’s just funny to see people here believe it’s their trading that’s making them 💰...not the second best trading year on record 🤣🐸☕️

It is how you are using it. Doesn’t mean that is the only use and future of the product. Snap is far from a simple messaging system. This is how you miss opportunities and what the initial discussion was about  as far expanding your contacts to all age groups to see how different groups are using it. You miss out on Opportunities, research snap related to AR, voice search, snap map, next level photo editing filtering....I have been scolded too many times for using the photo app instead of snap photo by some girls when taking pics. Rarely use snap to talk to friends as almost everyone is on different apps, but I frequently use the map and photo features.

Beeet Cooooiiiinn to da moon! 🚀🚀🚀🚀
You imbecile. How many times do I have to fucking tell you I didn’t intend on replying anything about our military until I saw his bullshit response to someone else? Need me to do it one more? Also, I don’t do overall rankings of countries like this guy because it’s delusional and pointless.
Yes please
The stock market was the only wild thing in 2020 

The rest of it was watching office reruns in my PJs

I guess not knowing about where the next roll of toilet paper will come from is kinda thrilling though
https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1340581313406001153?s=20
the big boys will definitely be buying up all the dips
ayyy se tu quieres
I shop for my gf's family who are older. I wear an N-95 mask and sanitize before and after. Go into the grocery store and fuckers (old fuckers) mask down from their nose, one dude with a plastic nose guard attached to his glasses as a mask, everyone bunched together and we are at all time highs. People are fucking stupid. If another more virulent strain pops out we are locked down till we get vaccinated.
Thanks.  There's so much complex simple shit to learn in the market and you just helped that click in my head.
PLUG ME IN DADDY

Sounds kinda retarded but at least make sure your wins are bigger than your losses
Lmao. Sounds about right. Kinda sad tbh
In other words never EVER buy options on margin. It’s common sense
Good for you then. Hard to tell from the image ip there. 
What if you had just held on to your initial buy? More gain or same?
After it drops at open, I’m all in on calls
If papa Elon tweets about beeteecee you buy comprendo? GRT to the moon 🌝
rip VALE call holders
What if..now hear me out..Elon wasn’t a “good guy”. What if..now hear me out..he wanted to have you in cars he can turn off using internet he can turn off with a chip in your brain he can turn off?

It’s not hard to appear for the culture with memes and a stock that makes people money however is directly contributing to what will be our economic collapse and by that time it won’t matter because you’ll be fully plugged in 

What if
**I mean at first your gonna pretend to forget her, you might call her I don’t know or whatever, but then eventually you really will forget about her.**

What it if she comes back first?

**Hmmmmmm see that’s the thing is somehow they know how to not come back until your really forget.**
Juicy... but im immune to 1 digit gains since im here. Dont get me wrong. 7,48 is woahhhhhh... but +127% in a week is more woahhhhhh! 

So i will buy calls!
# Did elon really tweet that LMFAOO
Sorry for your loss. Glad they said it's a wash and  you aren't screwed financially too.
This is a bulls dream btw
See here in the Republic of Texas we have huge lotteries that take all the perpetually poor people’s money so they don’t even think about making money just obtaining it.
belle looked so sad in that clip
Lmfaooo. Oh yea I’m sure that was way more painful than it needed to be. They always say how you get it is how you lose it
I dont remember.
What a colossal disaster it would be if the vaccine wasn’t effective for the new strain. I bet we’d get to a point where the world is like you know what fuck it may the best man win, and go full survival of the fittest mode
Oh I am real precise with my limit orders... not...
Elon tweeting. Buckle up
which stock to buy for 2021 ? i managed to earn 150k this year via stonks. But now im gonna go all in on shares for 2021, i need a stock that will go x8 or x9.

Please this is my ticket for fuck you money.
I am not looking forward to getting cucked by MRNA this Monday ;\_;
Cool, after that happens I’m going all in on calls.
ok go all in on puts then.
Nice try FBI

I literally run a hedge fund.
Too late to jump in on this ride?
Lol. Funny thing is that this was only one page of the screen shot I could get of all of Friday. Traded 1.3 million of tsla puts. Seems like a lot of shit to buy and sell
To only make 30k in a day
As long as you aren't losing a lot of money on bid-ask spreads.
I’d probably be happier if Imhotep was telling you the truth :(
what date tho, but I'm just trying to figure out if I had bought puts on the first day would I be up or down right now
A mutated Covid strain? March 2.0 inbound. I will not fuck this opportunity up
I’m a dirty theta gangbanger so I have $95-$100 call spread leaps.  I’m fine with trippling my money over the course of 3 months.  More of a long ass swing trade rather.
What else would you do in that downtime
Yeah I thought they had some dud eps this season and the show was lagging a little and then that last 10 minutes gave me a massive boner

Have you set a trailing stop?

Whats leaps did you buy? Been wanting to buy leaps but they’re so expensive.
Trevor Milton is a cunt
You honestly did pretty good tbh. Maybe you’re just a degenerate. Or idiot your choice
This is a toppy post.

RemindMe! 1 year "are we broke?"
Nah... Put it all in GME shorts

Once in a generational type stock rise... Yea you 100% just jumped into the markets 5 months ago lol

KBIO, volkswagen, the 2000 bubble would like to have a word with you. 

TSLA is historical but for different reasons, lots of 50 billion$ stocks have 4-5x year and tsla 8x so far. Big deal.
Bless u for thinking all of wsb can afford Tesla contracts.

Its a cucco
I believe it my cousin Ricky got the Brazilian one and now he can’t stop moving his fingers
It must be the confetti. Here in the fine commonwealth of Massachusetts we can gamble on shitty state lottery and horse races. They don’t want RH stealing from their god awful state revenue gainers. Oh we have casinos now too, but meh.
My buddy Imhotep says you're a poor retarded pleb.
You’re clearly a fucking illiterate retard. You defaulted to saying our military was number one when our country was criticized. 

That’s sad as fuck. Our military is there to defend the things that make our country great. It’s not what makes our country great. Get your fucking priorities straight.

Everyone will keep talking about PLTR. Nothing new.

I might have bought DASH puts too early...
Elon is warning us dollar is going tits up
Dudes get raped in court for divorce. Had a buddy who is a pilot, big ass house, kids in private school etc. She got everything and half of what he makes still. She even inherited a few million and it affected nothing. There is a guy living in his house and they won't get married because then he is off the hook. It's brutal.
there is something called a condom. e.g. Durex
What lessons did you even learn? How'd you do it?
So I'm not the only degenerate idiot?
sure
Its the Constitution. Its Mabo.
Why don’t you read the daily? Macd bullish cross will rocket it next week
Are you absolutely fucking retarded, are you really trying to tell me that Tesla is not a once in a generational type stock rise? Literally just completely fuck off you. You have no idea what you’re talking about.
Do you want too? Give me one Amazon share and we will do business.
FOMO is real
Some cock fighting going on there
Sounds like a typical Friday for me
That’s what ur mom asked me before I came in her mouth

what if you sucked your own penis and gave yourself AIDS 😂
... And girls
RemindMe! Jan 7 2021
I guess this is how we know we’re in a bubble
People took profit a lot earlier than I expected.  My plan was to trade the run-up until the beginning of last week.
I hate to tell you, but TSLA is the canary in this coal mine.  It will run up, and up, and up, and might even carry the entire fucking equity bubble on its own.

Until TSLA pops we run, and if everything else is running, buy every TSLA dip.  

You are right though, this shit will pop and it will be Enron level, but until then shorting this retarded ass shit is instant mod status.
Or short dated.  Just like your relationship
I remember this!
Wrap it up buddy
Time for another round of spy puts
Don't worry, she has a bearish candle forming. You dipped out at a good time.
DON'T DO IT MAN!! Vanguard is mainly for retirement accounts and safe investments with no options. So I'm guessing you didn't trade options, and from the stocks you mentioned, anyone who bought them in March and held made a killing. So it was your saavy, but most of all, luck. It's all downhill from here. You will be the hero now, but can you sustain those gains from here? 

Congrats! by the way.
I think I made 15k. Wish I could remove some of those shit trades.

Buy NIO instead.
I may read the prospectus to see what their plan is. On the driver side it feels duct taped together and the customer cost is way too high. They need cost- efficiency for their stock to survive and the past few years doesn't show much promise. Would be an interesting short

But do yourself a favour and look at quality of life index of Countries. Its not about cherrypicking specific parts, it looks at it on a more on a larger scale. 

Im sure you can find a place in USA with more lakes then a place in Canada lol thats not the point of this at all

The immaterial dimensions of the quality of life include Health, Education, Environmental Quality, Personal Security, Civic Engagement and Work-Life Balance. 

All of these are overall much better in Canada then the USA. No debate

My point is you are acting like this is normal behavior for the stock, and we can just find many more like it. And that’s just not the case, it’s really a once in a lifetime type of stock.

Position: QS - 300x dual verticals Jan 15 -50c/75c, -75p/45p using Robinhood margin glitch

He would have gone from up like 500 a contract to down 175 per this week, but I'm pretty sure he would've been assigned on all 1.5MM worth of -50c though since QS skew is pricing in borrow fees. Borrow fees probably murdered him over the weekend.

Bro, Tesla is a mega cap company up almost 800% this year alone. You can’t name one other mega cap company even close to that. It’s a meteoric rise that’s unmatched by almost any other stock in history. Mega cap stock, not some five dollar bio tech.

No I didn’t even think military until I saw the word nationalist and another comment that he made to someone else. Come to think of it, you were trying to correct him as well...
I think I understand except for the 50% profit part.  So let’s say the stock price was $100.  So you sell a covered call at a strike price of $125.  Let’s say the total premium is $1000.  So you pocket the $1000 immediately.  Where does the 50% profit come in?
[deleted]
ironically as someone that leans left i agree
Username checks out
There’s a big assumption there that BoA and Melvin are the only two big short positions. HF are not obliged to disclose short positions.

All we know is that Melvin has (or had?) a large put position (like 5mil if I remember correctly) and that BoA sell side is smashing the PT.

But we also know that GME actual float is like 30M shares considering the ownership of tracker ETFs that won’t sell and RC Ventures. So the short ratio is closer to 300% then 100%
Holy shit Doordash is brutal. "Would you like to drive 14 miles out for $5.50 and then 14 miles back for $0.00? Accept/Decline" Maybe it makes more sense in denser Tier One cities. I'll just trade the stock instead 😎

Nokia made cell phones. Even before the iPhone, there were smartphone companies popping up as early as 2000. They didn’t revolve. 

Tesla is about changing our energy source. Serious market entry barrier. Also, how products are made, leveraging data, AI, etc. Part of generative engineering is evolution though data feedback loop. Catching up is harder than manufacturing another phone.

Thank you for saying this. I went short on the plummet and closed at about 350. When it kept going down I figured I should buy back and set a limit buy at close for about 690.

Just wanted to be part of history.

China's government mandates forcing all cars to be electric and also pushing the price of solar panels lower each year. But TSLA stock is too inflated to invest in, but they're making solar panels, home batteries, and possibly HVAC.

If you live in Florida, you might be able to live off-grid with TSLA stuff in 5 years.
What else do you want me to mention? You said healthcare is expensive but its cheaper then most of its counterparts in Europe and even America spends more....

The only thing I will concede on is that its better to live in America if you are chasing money in most professional careers. Like their tech industry is 30x bigger then ours.

But that doesnt come into the quality of life argument. Our water is cleaner, our air is better, etc etc etc.

Yes it literally is one of the reasons. You know they do more than destroy right? They try to help people during conflicts. There’s strict rules of engagement  and innocent civilians depend on us to keep extremists from gaining power.  Also, he made the comment that other countries have a better military. Even if all the NATO countries were combined, they wouldn’t stand a chance.
I got like 300 shares but this is a long play. The only thing that stops this rocket to take off is the lawsuit. If the jury starts listening to the science Bayer would already have won this settlement but it’s not only about glyphosat it’s about politics. Besides all that shit Bayer is a innovative and healthy company long term 49€ per stock is a good entry

Did he really misspell “calls”? It’s 5 letters for Christ sake. Really only 4 cause the s is plurality. Goddamn man. No choice but to exit my cals...no choice after this
I might regret asking this - but here we go - I have some good cash lying and some positional plays that may take weeks/month to realise. So I want to do something sophisticated than my avg. reatrd bets to keep me occupied while my positional bets. So that I don't keep looking at my positional plays in desperation and paper hand them away. 

So suggest me some daily activity which is relatively safe and can add some steady income (it's okay if it's not big).

I was thinking about selling weekly calls after this gigantic rally might be smart choice. But would love to listen to something more sophisticated.

My local Taco Bell replaced their $1 menu with a "Cravings" menu and now even the beef and rice burritos are $1.29. That's a 29% increase in inflation this year and possibly even more since you don't even get the Frito strips in the downgraded item.

BULLISH
McConnell Bucks or Biden Bucks 🤔
I'm usually playing off of earnings, waiting on one catalyst to get the ball rolling, and then a couple weeks out from there so the stock can stabilize a little bit and I can recover my losses if I'm wrong.
Biden. Bucks. I’m RICH!!!!!!!!!!
what this paying you speak of?
We also get the British stimulus monies once the entire population gets wiped out.

Or softly, and no way to tell when something may or may not happen

So we know it will go up or down, or possibly sideways and then up or down, and we have no idea when or how much. So it's very valuable information.
Not like this
Can someone explain how this is possible?
Don't try Forex with that attitude
had sold covered calls lol. got assigned at $20 strike. was planning to sell it off anyway.
But think of what your doing to rupert Murdoch's bottom line. The man has a family to feed.
In what? Definitely not weaponry or training.
It’s fucking Cramer.
More stimulus!
It will be and should be to be honest. It sucks but reality is things aren't improving. I live in one of the lowest rate counties in the UK yet got a full lockdown imposed from midnight last night with 6 hours warning so I'm pretty mad
That is me right now, life is improving at a faster rate then 5% I assure you

Yes not sustainable
Same, sideways and sliding. Now I only do random buys I see here that actually look good, like QQQJ 6/21 31c from today, only picked up 1 contract. I won't spend more than that on them anymore 1-200 and one contract, but it's got to be close to the money.

Took a one time loss to convert my portfolio into stocks and sells, doing quite nicely. recovered that one time loss, and I'm up now. I hope you triple your money next year.

IMO, you bet against a bubble by getting out at the right time, not by betting on when it's going to pop. That's why I don't touch Tesla. I showed up late to the party, the price is ridiculous, but I've seen what happens to everyone who tries to short it. I'll get the next one.

Make general assumptions about companies and go from there, note taking here is a big plus as you can look back what assumptions have changes. I wouldn’t waste too much time on colorful lines. On positions watch option pricing and try to pick the cheapest or best priced options, and IV of the options. Your option plays are actually decent. Except for Nike as next week could be unpredictable because of Tesla.
I say this completely honestly, but the best boss I ever had was a single, 40 year old black lady who graduated with a degree from Stanford. She was the shit and I always looked forward to my weekly 1 on 1's with her for feedback. I always ended up feeling better about myself and my job security after talking with her. She had great EQ skills.

Best advice right here. Ask your friends what's popular right now. Look around, what are people driving? Using? Buying? I have a buddy who is really into gaming and I asked what what people were excited about. Was able to time Nvidia's new graphics card and the stock climbed +$80

Upside would make them a $90B company and I just dont think TSLA is a $90B company. Pricing in:

\- Early stage of Models by 2020 (Gas stations with EV setups are still a rarity and Cyber/Semi wont be in 2020)

\- Cost savings from Gigafactory/Robotics yet to materialize

\- Elon will probably IPO or Direct List the Space X to squeeze maybe $1-2B more in value.

\- Need for cash due to overall cash burn

I made 300k in 15 minutes once by buying TSLA puts right after elon tweeted that he thinks the stock price is too high. I also sold 100k in TSLA calls a few weeks ago that would have been 900k an hour later which really sucked.
I'm also 30, saved/loaned up my yearly wage, sold 2%/wk options against that and will have most of that loan paid off by next year. Once that's paid off I'll get my yearly wage purely through that instead of the office grind.
Wonder what I’ll be spending my Biden bucks on????? Maybe something EV related ?!?!?

None of this matters if the Dems win in Georgia. But yes, in theory, if somehow we collapse again next year then we'd need an act of congress to turn on the money printer. Can't just turn it on/off like Mnuchin has been doing. But that's if the R's retain control of the senate.

Nope. It's an ego thing for that one stupid senator. He wanted the Fed lending program to go through congressional approval. That's not happening, thank goodness. 

The only thing he got was Fed programs can't be "identical" but they can be "similar." Again, no congressional approval and "similar" = printer remains on brrrrrrrrrrrrr mode

Props for mentioning WBA finally on WSB. Such an underrated vaccine play. 

Some facts, the federal government will pay a little over 30 dollars for each dose of Covid vaccine administered by the pharmacies contracted such as CVS/Walgreens etc. 

So far roughly 25,000 long term care facilities have chosen Walgreens to administer the two doses of  vaccines. Roughly same number have chosen CVS.

I think the theory is not just how much money CVS and WBA will directly make from administering the doses. Let’s say WBA will make 1-2 dollars as profit per dose out of the 30 dollars charged, if 40 million people will choose WBA to get vaccine (assuming 20% out of 200 million people who are willing to get vaccine, as WBA’s market share is 20%), that will lead to a 400-800 million dollars net profit per year. Sounds pretty good ha? But I am not sure whether it needs to be done every year. 

The real deal is that WBA and CVS will benefit from administering Covid vaccine in the long term, based on:

1. It will enhance its brand value as a credible vaccine administer, which will likely make more people go to pharmacies to get their vaccines such as flu shots and others.  It is free PR. 

2. Establishing direct cooperation with LTC facilities will solidify and increase its customer base as the aged people living in LTC facilities are very likely the customers of the pharmacies. 

3. Investors will boost their confidence in the brick and mortar pharmacy chains as they realize that there are a lot of health care services that Amazon couldn’t provide like WBA and CVS.
Nah, actually everybody hates you.

Generally an ascending wedge would break down and a descending wedge would break up. Something like this is pretty neutral. But those are just very lose generalizations. I think it’s more helpful to think about the psychology that is implicit behind why each one forms/breaks the way they do. In this case it really looks to me like healthy price discovery/consolidation. One reason that I am bullish about this particular set up is that the red volume is relatively low through the entire consolidation period.

Missed the context here. This is a pandemic and delivering needed product, people will not go to amazon and wait for shipping even if Doordash can deliver it instant.

This isn’t the battery company I am invested in. If Tesla is the company now and going into the future, then whoever is going to be manufacturing Tesla batteries in the future is who you want to invest in. If Elon built a factory in England and Spain or France, think about the ability for his company to grow.         

If Elon reads this, announce a $50 special dividend with earnings, sell a bunch of shares, then use some money to exercise your bonus, and use the rest of the money to buy back shares at a depleted value.

If a stock has been going straight up for the last 20 days, it’s the time I buy. If it’s green 20 days in a row, it means it’s a good stock and the odds of it going down is very low in my opinion

150% (margin) minimum
Which expiration because I tend to get the most experience from weeklies but experience doesn’t necessarily convert into tendies. I was waiting for 480 again when we were at 590. If I buy calls I bet the market will tank. 

If tsla tanks and I buy on a dip, it will dip further. I’ll update if I place a call.
So are TSLA puts free money?
Holiday and gaming hardware sales are gonna be huge for the next earnings call I think. Depending on the run up I might sell half my calls prior. It’s tried and true with a loyal user base, and boomers (who are trying to catch up with these massive tech market gains) recognize the name and will see the super low P/E and won’t be able to help their penny-pinching selves from jumping on a good deal. Price is just more beat up then it probably should be.

I think people sleep on the Kia because of their rep for being the cheap Korean brand. For the price of a 100k base Odyssey or Sienna you can get a loaded Sedona at half the miles. They all have reliable boring V6s and get the same sort of mileage and drive like a box. The biggest thing to consider is the Sienna can have AWD if you want that and the Pacifica seats fold into the fucking floor and it is glorious. Seriously, the Pacifica doesn't feel like a piece of shit FCA product. I thought the Odyssey was overhyped and overpriced, Honda reliability except for the glass transmission I guess, everyone forgets the reliable hondas don't have a V6, maybe the new 10 speed is better though.

Most of my holdings are for at least 3 months. What I usually seek out though is sustainable growth for the next 5 years based on road maps and what I believe they can reasonably accomplish based on my experiences and what has historically happened in the respective industry.

Response to this post from the godfather, u/VitoCorlene :

""I like both. Original post had both. I like MT more because steel makers don't just need iron ore to manufacture. If iron ore becomes too expensive, they can use shredded scrap - this is what many of the newer facilities utilize as raw material in EAF's. Electric Arc Furnace. They can produce quicker and more efficiently. Playing the iron ore angle will only get you so far - as when it gets too expensive or supply is strained - steel makers will use other derivatives to manufacture. Finished steel demand is backed up until May/June. People are buying 6-7 months out needing it 3-4 months out. There will be shortages and MT and other large manufacturers will be able to take advantage of spot/non-contract pricing on their floor stock and blow up margins."

I know, I’m just kinda hoping London won’t be locked down on NYE. I’ve spent the last 9 months being quiet and trying to convince others to do so so we could starve this thing to death by July, doing my part and then some, but tbh now I’m just resigned to the fact that not nearly enough Brits have enough brain cells to understand what needs to be done, or the compassion/determination to do it. I’m just glad WSB isn’t that big in the UK because otherwise we’ll be broker than Greece by this time next year
When your playing with house money you can afford it 😎
its 11% of their fund last time i checked. thats massive for an ETF
No. The trade is profitable. The bank will 100% exercise the option, sell enough to cover the cost, and deposit the rest in your account.

A wedge like that is a neutral pattern, but since we're in an uptrend, the breakout odds slightly favors a continuation to the upside.

Lower Bollinger Band is racing upwards too while the upper BB is mostly flat. When you see a flat upper BB with a sharply rising lower BB, usually means spring compression before moving higher.

This has nothing to do with stopping the fed from propping up the markets or ensuring liquidity. Republicans love markets. 

All this was about was stopping the Fed from providing backdoor bailouts for state and local governments. They tapped almost NONE of the money under Trump because they didn't need it, but there was a fear they might under a Biden treasury and get some sweetheart deal.

CVS is much more undervalued than Walgreens. CVS’s fair value is $92.

The Aetna merger is probably a headwind for CVS right now, considering they overpaid and integration of that size is tricky.

I'm still at my job, I'm doing engineering related stuff for the company, though my pay doesn't reflect that. But I'm ok because I have the ability to work part time around my schedule. Why are you a former engineer and what engineering did you do?

What happens if that number has already been used for Uber eats before?

Like I’m genuinely terrified of ever losing my original cell number I’ve had since middle school that no one else has ever had. I mean I don’t give a shit about losing out on new subscriber sales but can you imagine if you lost your phone number before you got a chance to change it on everything and then you can’t use two factor authentication and you’re locked out of literally everything??? Some sites let you choose either email or phone but some only give you the option of phone verification...

And then imagine all the shitty calls you’d get constantly. Like my Google voice number is always getting random calls for other people. My current phone number is going to be like... passed down to my grandchildren because it’s a pure virginal phone number
You’re an idiot and should be trading. No offense.

Damn... Now we can no longer say “stimmy talks going well.”

WSB won’t be the same.
I'm in my 40s and autistic as fuck. I already have a little over $1 million in my 401k cos I dumped as much money into it as I could over my working career.  It was all-in on stock mutual funds for 20+ years now, except I moved most of it to bonds in January / February just before the COVID shit storm (cos I saw bond prices were going up AND stocks were going up, which is a bad sign).  Then DCA'ed it all back to stock funds from early March to late April.

Then after this huge fucking run-up, I moved it all to a 3% APY income fund a month ago cos the market is overpriced as fuck now. Technically, my 401k has lost out on an extra 1% in gains from being out of the market but I'm day trading thousands of dollars in my non-401k accounts and more than making up for that missed gains.

When you get rich and have a lot of money stashed away, then you can toss $10K at some calls and not blink an eye.

TLDR: get rich over a 20 year period then you can be hella autistic and toss mucho dinero at shit and not give a fuck.
It’s so good it hurts... my brain.

This guy has it right. If you want to go by crayons, then really take a look besides just hoping. Wedge is(and has been...) forming, but oscillators have it way overbought.

Oh I truly think it's due for a correction, but I think it's a false equivalence in comparing tesla to yahoo, I can see Tesla catching up to the stock price someday even though it's overvalued now. Yahoo was just smut news and and email and message board domain that not that many used and was at $354 in 2000, that would be $534 today.

When I was in school I thought why is college so expensive and how much can I really earn after I graduate, what is the return on investment?

I blocked that that kook so long ago
BS in ME, and systems and controls for MS. I was interested in defense and aerospace companies, but I literally had zero callbacks for hundreds of apps. Taking some automotive control/powertrain classes to increase my chances at different industries. And systems engineering classes too.

Wow did stimmy talks really go well wtf did not expect Mitch the bitch to agree to anything
Got in at around $17 and I was up almost 37% the next morning only to have it drop and hit my 20% trailing stop. Moral: take profit immediately on shitty gambling stonks.

baby dick but ull still suck it
Back when this all started I was convinced it was released intentionally to trigger an economic boom. Plus we definitely don’t have enough senior living and nursing homes for that whole generation. We also don’t have anywhere near the number of healthcare workers we need to care for the aging boomers. The handful of people I have known personally who died of Covid, or died of anything at all since the pandemic started, were a few years away from nursing home status. At least three of them my whole family was just like “at least they died before they had to be in a nursing home.” Like. Legitimately. Covid is saving a lot of people from that, and that’s not necessarily a bad thing.... at least not when it’s your own family and you know what nursing homes are like and you never want to see them experience that

Medicare would be fucked if it weren’t for Covid. Yeah Covid has been expensive but geriatric care and nursing homes for an entire generation is not cheap
Do you think INTC would do that? - What's your source?
Plus their estates get passed down to younger people more likely to spend it rather than hoard it to spend out as an effective annuity.
call the collections agencies and bargain, you basically tell them: I'll pay x right now if you take this off my credit report today

even if you owe 2x it might work -- they rarely get the money they're after, so anything will be better than zero

they also buy your debt for a fraction of what you actually owed, the company you didn't pay already wrote off the losses

Biggest mistake ppl make is comparing 2 completely diffrent companies and thinking thats gonna end up same
Are you trying to "time" a crash, or getting leaps?
Timing the market is HARD. Take a look at tipranks and you’ll see how most of the professionals do. If an analyst has a 70%+ success rate with their predictions that’s the top percentile.
Yeah, they all hang with Bezos and Musk. They’ve taken so much and left nothing for the working class that never had a chance. 

I mean, look at Elon Musk, he was born with all that privilege...in South Africa. Oh wait, this one is going to be tricky.
try catching a chicken you fuck
yo this is cool. this shit real time?
Yes. I moved close to work because I hate driving, being stuck in traffic and wasting money commuting.
Holding calls?
Why would you let a lady do it. I always gone to male barbers. Ladies already made lot of money on expensive rebonds while male barbers can’t cater to female consumers
50k damn boi
Shut up baby dick
This dude just compared Tesla to AOL, Motorola, and other companies that aren't here today. He has a point, but we're in a time where companies can scale globally and one or two companies tend to dominate the industry, not like 20 years ago when there was a flurry of shitty companies.
High IQ take.

Dude what
I agree completely. But It's easy to see the gold with hindsight. But the gold to shit ratio is not great. So many plays posted that are just stupid. People come up with clever pump and dumps. So it can be difficult to sort through the shit to find the gold.

Yeah I hope I dont get rona and die, still have my 300k in TSLA puts...
I’m not really sure what happens for Friday, I know that AH just starts early Thursday (so can still affect ITM/OTM but yeah I’d just go ahead and close whatever positions you’re holding for 12/24 expiry and don’t want to be assigned.  I’m sure there’s info about how options with expirations on non-trading days are handled on the CBOE or something.
How’s the robo advisor at Schwab fellas? Thinking about putting 10K into it from my 30K emergency fund which is rotting away at 0.50% yield.

It really is one of the only subs/places that lets free speech happen. But even that is shrinking day by day. Every single day more people try to shut down unique ideas and just spout what the tv says they should. 

And I don't even know what caused this drama to happen in this specific instance and I don't care. I just hate how so many people try to stop people from having different opinions, even if they don't agree with them or think they are wrong. Shit is wack. Thought police everywhere in 2020.

He’s one of the few that actually knows this shit
Probably Aspergers if anything. I tend to think a lot of really successful people check a lot of boxes on the spectrum.
I'm unironically reported him for harassment. The weekend thread is the 2 days where rules are lowered and we can actually talk about stuff that isn't stock related. 

I'll take all the insults in the world because it's free speech and WSB is kinda one of the last subs that support free speech.

This isn't true lol.
What last year?
One of the funniest movies ever created.
62+ conservative PT before NIO DAY 
But I’m thinking close to 70
+-.8% sounds like pure chance, unless you’re playing something super low volatility. (Obviously not tsla)
Tesla to Mars. Obv get 5yr calls at 10k eZ 10mil. Profit
Imagine thinking the future goes down
If she usually does your taxes then how did she miss the extra 70-80k a year? Im inclined to think she won’t be too surprised with this saved money. She must have some sort of idea that you have an extra bank account that she doesn’t have access to. There’s no way she does your taxes and can’t see this extra money just disappearing. (Unless you did something illegal to get it) I wouldn’t even sweat it man. Hell I might not even tell her and just let her see it when she starts doing your taxes 😂
were? it's never ending. the last word you'll hear before your death will be Palantir.

Can’t say for sure for these brokers specifically, but I would expect that you should see the disallowed losses due to wash sales on the 1099s
Sometime next 36 months. 😂

Analysts are wrong all the time so why not just yolo it all and have your wife run off with her new boyfriend. However your slightly happy because that bitch always doubted you and your ability to provide a living. One day it all works out and she comes crying back to you. Telling her one phrase, I’m buying puts on you. Leaving to a cabin in the woods and seeing a bear fuck another bear. Realizing they are both males you grab your trusty rifle shoot them. Finally killing those 🌈🐻. Later that night you pass away in your sleep knowing you were the one to kill the 🌈🐻
Doesn’t mean it’s not due for a correction. I’m not saying I’m betting against Tesla, but there’s no arguing its price movement this year has been ludicrous. Ludicrous run up means harsh correction at some point even if the run up eventually continues. What goes up must come down. Same thing goes for the whole market.

Any reason you expect people to be leaving ARKx?
All this trading options?

Yeah, the nurse fainting after getting vaccine is just a coincidence. She has some disease that caused it

We gotta stop fear mongering. Experts already approved this vaccine and side effects are just minor
Start funding your kids 529 (or equivalent) plan if you haven’t. If you can manage it personally, you could even put it all in TSLA calls. But seriously, congratulations and fuck you.
I never get how these people can consistently fuck up a haircut. I feel like giving a haircut is something that once you’ve learned how to do, you should be good to go.

My thoughts on Tesla is this, I’m bullish on the fact that their business will grow and that they’re innovative, but I’m bearish on their stock price given their valuation.
We need more fear mongering so there will be more dips. Cos then we can BTFD.

Apple also sells watches, monitors and computers in addition to their phones. They also control a marketplace inside their products, where they get their share. They have a revenue of 275 billion vs Tesla's 20 billion. Market cap of 2.15 trillion vs Tesla's 659 billion.
Alright, I hate politics but it fucking irks me to no end how that republican senator is acting with the Fed stuff. Literally used it all year to fluff markets but as soon as Dems win, ohh noooo can’t have the Dems using emergency Fed powers anymore.

My friends dad was had been playing the volatility in IPO's for the last couple years. He plays with $30K and puts it in for a few minutes and pulls it back out. His goal was to make 200 a day which he claimed was really easy. That was on top of his day job and he also had an early investment in Apple. I'm pretty sure he is loaded, but he spends quite a lot. He was living in a 600k house in a city where you could easily get a nice 1300 sq ft house for 100K. He also changes cars non-stop. He had a model 3, then a hellcat, then he's in a Vintage Mercedes SL500, then the Ford GT500. He's in sales, but for a small credit union, so he can't be making much more than 100k. There are a lot of people playing the game, but if you find a way to play with quick bursts like he is doing you could really do well and also avoid a blowing the whole nut.

Respectfully disagree.

Example taken from thebalance.com:

Let's assume the stock market has a bad year. You sell a stock or mutual fund and realize a $20,000 loss with no capital gains that year. First, you'll use $3,000 of the loss to offset your ordinary income. The remaining $17,000 will carry over to the following year.

Next year, if you have $5,000 of capital gain, you can use $5,000 of your remaining $17,000 loss carryover to offset it. You can use another $3,000 to deduct against ordinary income, leaving you with $9,000.

We'll find out on Monday.

Only thing I know is around 3pm on Friday I started to see the gains for the day fading FAST, sold 90% of everything. Some of the stonks I don't have a lot of confidence in either.

I day trade not night trade.
Biggest drain on your wallet. Constant headaches because a good relationship takes alot of swallowing your pride on things you don't see eye to eye on and ya know love doesn't always come with positive emotions, like the old saying goes there's not that much difference between love and hate. 

In spite of all of this I believe in the sanctity of Marriage.
well i mean there's smallcap index, you scan them, you find companies you know/trust that aren't recovered yet, check options, if they seem cheap and 52W recovery is achievable place your 2/3yr bet. Not going to do your homework for you.
So I smell stimmy money, give me stocks I've never heard of and dates please
Fuck off and let us dream
uhhhhhh

Great point about SolarWinds hack.

Palantir offers a similar service but their software is built for the highest level of US government clearance. Even foreign government hackers will have issues cracking it.

It was funny to see other cybersec stocks being boosted by the hack news but PLTR having a down day... People really don't know what they do or what the potential of their technology is...

Yea, "fact checking" websites are just all apart of the same media conglomerate that rush to dissolve anything that goes against the narrative. 

Remember when the CDC reported that only 6% of coronavirus deaths were actually due to covid19? Fact checkers had a field day on that one.

Hopefully after stimulus it's canceling student loan debt

Elon announces cap raise for SPCE buyout, you heard it here first.
This doesn't mean anything. From my understanding, Congress can continue to reinstate funding for emergency programs like the ones in the CARES act. All that this amounts to happening is that there is a formal shutdown of the original emergency funding programs from the CARES act which had already been informally shutdown.
Do you have puts yes or no

If yes, your opinion is invalid and you should feel bad
I jerked off to this
best of luck
When people say '4 plates', it means 4 on each side.

Shhhh don’t tell him
there's already a talks of a second stimulus for next year after this one. so still bullish
Imagine deadlifting. All I do is bench press and curls. 8 days a week
OH GOD I FUCKING CAME
This stimulus bill is priced in, we need hints about new Biden stimulus bill in 2021.
Wrong sub. You want r/thetagang
Stimulus talks going well
1. Read WSB
2. Look up ticker on Robinhood
3. Check RH rating (buy/hold/sell) 
4. If WSB is bullish + RH is mostly “buy” rating, buy calls
5. If WSB is bearish + RH is mostly “sell” rating, buy puts

I’m up over 300% this year despite losing thousands on some plays that didn’t work out.  Spend about 10-20 min in the morning when I wake up, set the buy, soon as the buy executed set my sell threshold, go back to work and repeat the next morning.

They don’t do that kind of thing in white collar/fed pens. He’s going to go in there retarded and walk out an AuTiSt that becomes a billionaire via some Ponzi scheme only to yolo it on Tesla fds.

You are a raging idiot.
sell some calls and buy the rest from those premiums
Someone flair me for breaking the stimulus news here. whatta fk does one need to do to be flaired
Otm puts, switch to cc when assigned
Asked about books here last weekend and got few replies but a couple good suggestions. I’m not really into that style of book you’re reading so instead I’ll just suggest the short story “A Retrieved Reformation”. 10 min read so not a big investment if you don’t care for it.
If u can’t deadlift 4 plates do u even gym bro?
Well that’s just unforgivable
This is assuming they care about the scalper problem, or care enough, but unfortunately that’s not the case for most retailers which is why they are also closing down their stores. 

However one benefit that this does provide is that although high, some of the demand is artificial so it will keep on going until eventually dying down, but will result in crazy earnings which will be the catalyst.
everyone here thinks it’s limit up this and gap up that, by inversing we gather the following: priced in
Good thing I joined the army
Sounds like the correct narrative to choose.
The state has been letting people gamble forever, it’s called the lottery. Retards give the government millions of tendies every year playing lottery games that have like .4x principal average payout, but they don’t mention that. Weeklies are a better thing for poor people to chuck their money at than lottery tickets
Good luck with your weeklies
Genuinely curious to the downside of RH? Real new here, just getting my feet wet in investing outside of 401k and mellow index fund based brokerage account.

I opened a RH recently as side project of sorts where I could throw disposable income at risky ideas.

This is the cold harsh truth. People argue the stock market is disconnected from reality but it's actually them that aren't seeing reality clearly.
whats the bad news i have 8 calls
🍆💦
Tesla might hit 800 this Monday. And this will push SPY to 900..
No the dignity is first my dude.. duh
13-50 = got damn 47
I think things will dump on Monday due to restrictions on the Fed. So I'm going to adjust my limit buy orders a bit lower to take that into consideration. And I'll turn half my market buy orders I sent in into limit buys that are at lower prices than at market close on Friday. I'm still bullish over the next 2 years on the market.
Breh when your work is shut down due to Covid, every day is Saturday night.
Im willing to bet hedgefunds lock in their gains 2nd half December
This is going to piss off a lot of people in here haha
The dude who was fighting to limit the fed basically gave up. There’s going to be some small provisions in there about the fed but Jerome will still operate at practically 100% power.

Every year, actually
I’m not saying any of these blue skied speculative dreams aren’t gonna happen, but for any of these things to happen, we are going to have to wait a damn long time... 

Bottom line is, we aren’t gunna see their first dollar in revenue until 2024 (according to their estimates). That’s a long time. A lot can happen in that time. Even by 2024, QS still wouldn’t have even proved they’re capable of meeting manufacturing demand; something Tesla is STILL focusing on. 

And honestly Elon will prob have better batteries if not something equivalent by then... 

QS needs to hustle.

i fucking hope not im balls deep in calls. but unfortunately if theres one thing i learned about trading in 2020 is that the only thing that seems to drop the market is negative fed news...
He’ll find a way to shoot it down. He’s got to make it look like he’s on board until he noticed some flaws so he still has a good rep if he wants to run again.
no the fed saying the banks can do stock repurchases helps bank stocks the most

don't ask about the loans that aren't being paid rn though.

Oh ya you like it dont you
Well your income is correlated to your degree and school
And half day Thursday.  Christmas yknow.
You're retarded
On a Sunday?
honestly, you've just gotten lucky. if your system or intuition is that good, you'll be a millionaire in no time but that level of accuracy won't last. Markets behave pretty randomly when analyzing the short-term.
You’ll either need to deposit the money to bring your account to a positive (which I’m guessing you won’t be able to) or you will need to sell those shares or your broker will liquidate your position for you. You’ll want to close it yourself because you’ll owe the balance difference for everything below your strike price. Therefor if you paid a strike of 500 and the stock drops to 490 you’ll owe 10$ for each share
[deleted]
Yeah liquidity that hasn’t hit the market yet is already priced in, good thinking bro
Thursday, Saturday, and Sunday are the correct nights to drink on.

That way you dont have a hangover on Saturday so you get to actually enjoy your day, and then Sunday you drink your big hangover from saturday night off by 2pm and continue to keep a solid buzz going through most of the afternoon and night until 9pm. Bed by 11 at the latest and your hangover isnt too bad plus mondays already suck if you work a standard 9 to 5 so fuck em.

Stimmy passing huge green Monday see y’all then
Not gona lie politics ain’t my shit. But we got stimulus and just need congressional approval to continue QE at similar rates. D runs congress. R senate was tryna stop it that’s what was causing the delays. With stimulus passing i don’t see what leverage R has anymore?

Market price and NAV are different. So technically you can, especially ETF without a massive cap (something like BNE or the other new funds).

That said WSB is mostly just fucking with the options on it, I don't think they are pumping the shares much.

Exactly. This was not a win for WSB.
I think one of AMDs big advantages is it's partnership with the superior TSMC (vs intels in house fab, which seems to be their current achilles heel). TSMC is in bed with so many winners right now that I'm almost more bullish on it than AMD itself.
If you could actually do proper research you'd know that dems fought back and the republican guy dropped his stance on limiting the fed
Nah this is opposite of sell the news if it passes big money coming in long term
Cuz it is the fact. No question senorita
Go fuck yourself if you think DASH puts aren’t gonna print
I like how all these leaks have some big ass lettering and you can barely see the video

Tesla is a car company and comes in last in quality and manufacturing production compared to Toyota and Tesla only has 3 car types currently.

Nissan had the most sold EV car in the world called the leaf.

I don't have any calls or puts on TESLA but the the company's market value makes no logic if it is even a Tech company. Check out other companies with how TESLA is actually making money and they don't even come close to the same value.
TSLA gonna pussie SPY to 400. That was the whore purpose of including TSLA in S&P 🚀
No it's not.  Where the hell are you getting that from?

Also is BoA shorting GME?
This is the real DD
they just had a $10 dividend. It isn't a normal dip.
Yeah I have a lot of different stocks- but it’s only one of 16 call options I have 

If stocks count as positions I have like 40 positions total

lol! I've been applying to just about any engineering related job out there and all around US. Eventually, I got somewhat related one, low pay, but I can put that on resume, so i'm fine for now. Decided to work on my MS, since my BS is not getting me anywhere.

Nothing matters but the stimulus ... nothing but the stimmy
Stimmy keeps working until it stops working. I think we're closer to the stop working side than the no problem side now. We're many stimmys in after 2008 and the balance sheet of thsi coutnry never recovered from that, and our debt buyers (China) won't prop this up beyond the point of no return. If we dip back into another one of these, I don't know if the Fed can prop up markets the same way. But if it can't we're really all fucked. So you only have one choice, which is buy stocks and calls, and buy guns.
He just tweeted he wanted stimmy.

Lol, and you downvoted me too.   Do you really not get  it?  You add the disallowed loss (a positive number) to your new basis, so you can make extra money without realizing gains on it to balance not being able to offset previous gains with those losses in the previous year.  😂

I like it better that way
Yeah, volatility is critical to day trading. That being said, no retail human investor could move fast enough to really capitalize on the price movement Friday. Especially those market moving trades end of day were on INSANE volumes (16M shares in the last 10 minutes). That’s half of 30DAV. Absolute massive block trades you’d basically have to front run to get executions favorable enough to make it worthwhile

There are other ways. He can appropriate FEMA funds if they directly address pandemic response, say for instance to fund hospitals. Trump already did this so there is precedent.

Small business is the bigger problem, the federal government normally doesn't deal with that so the main ways involve getting congress to sign off on sending money to the states for that purpose. That will be the biggest hurdle as congress is NOT interested in helping small business AT ALL.

Market wise this is good for us (and rich cunts) but bad for America.

Mega caps are going to benefit massively from this status quo. Mid caps are going to explode on speculation of future growth. IPOs are going to continue to be bonkers.
Altria’s got a 45% stake in cronos with warrants to buy more. This is a set and forget Most loyal customers out there no worries about the dividend because they can’t advertise on TV and stuff like that it’s almost guaranteed and they have stakes in everything good long term play wouldn’t ever buy options on it though
I hate the whole elaborate signature shit even more. College faculty and students are the worse with it. Its like dude nobody gives a shit.

The serious answer is the amount of time that you feel comfortable with your understanding of the stock/company. 

For some companies it may take awhile to understand what they do, how it works, and how they are going to make money. For other companies, you basically know all that because they are established and you just need to consider some potential risks. 

You talked about PLTR in some of your responses. It’s a newer stock. They have some shares locked up. People don’t really understand what they do. They were primarily government agency oriented but now are expanding more in commercial. They have earnings that could suck or explode....etc. 

Compare that to Verizon. They just do their thing. Everyone knows what they do. They pay a reasonable dividend and chug along. 

My point being, the price of Verizon is probably pretty accurate and not very volatile. It’s fairly straightforward and you don’t need to do a lot of guessing on share price unless you think there’s a chance that telecoms are going out of business.

PLTR is a different animal. Realistically, someone could argue they deserve a $9 price target or a $90 price target. It just depends on how you view all the different variables. 

So to your question, try to do enough to understand the companies to know what they do and what the risks/factors are, and determine if you think the current price is reasonable. And then invest and monitor what happens (verify against your assumptions you write down). 

On a side note. I’ve never invested in Tesla because the valuations made no sense to me. But clearly, even if the traditional measures don’t make sense, it doesn’t mean you can’t make money. 

So try to be fluid about your convictions and be willing to take a small loss to fight another day if wrong.
Sorry to hear man (or woman). Hope all is good with you

sell your TSLA at a loss on Dec 15 to realize the tax losses but also sell a naked put on TSLA expiring after Jan 15 to get some tendies in case TSLA goes up higher while you waitout the 30 days.

Chance for 1000% return or definite 100% loss is an easy equation for retards.
If i see enough "🚀🚀🚀" i will
So 10k in losses washed forward.  Which means you realized 10k more gains in 2020 than you wanted to.  Now in 2021 you are closing your new position, let’s say at 65k.  Since you add the 10k to the 55k basis, your realized gain is $0.   I suppose if you’d prefer to declare the basis as 45k and pay taxes on 20k of realized gains the irs will take it.   Walnuts.

I feel good. I think assuming HK goes well we will have a solid Monday. Still need to see how HK feels about ANT response to regulatory requirements. It wasn't widely publicized on here but ANT made some changes to their high return savings accounts in accordance with requests from the regulator.

I find this to be a bullish indicator but I think it's what caused the downtrend on Friday that carried across into the US market.

So we will see. If HK folks think regulator getting into ANT and sorting everything out is good then we go up. If they think it's bad and signifies too much interference in fintech space then BABA, JD and other Chinese fintech could be headed downwards.

If your option is in the money your broker will sometimes automatically exercise the call. You need to close the call before expiry and eat the cost of the premium. I'm guessing your call was ITM and you let it expire. Now your on the hook for however many contracts x 100 shares.

Why the hell would he waste money on a tax attorney?   The rules are pretty fucking straight forward.  Deduct 3k a year until you die as the irs rarely checks the shit for how much of a loss you ever declared in years back.

You can’t honestly believe what you just said...right? You could give everyone 2k checks and they could dump it into the stock market all at the same time and it would be negligible to the amount big corporations trade every single day. So by poor, if you mean everyone except the .001%...you are right. If you think the stock market works off this subreddit, you must not realize all it would take is for them to rug pull this 1 time off this type of news and alllllll those tendies from stimulus would go to that .001% that you’re allowing to be happy

Yes. Also it looks like banks are overcapitalised atm and may be allowed to perform share buybacks shortly so I would definitely consider getting into some financials (specifically BAC) if you are interested in riding the economy recovery wave.

For fucking real. It's not AI-based vaccine development. This is a standard tax form. Depending on how many trades it's a bitch but even a wagecuck could do it manually with the forms provided by your broker. 

Or just try to let a tax program import it.

or tariff or shortage in the market...
Fed took a different approach this time and are instead buying the credit bonds directly. This directly adds liquidity to the debt markets and prevents the risk-off behaviour seen during 08.

We can see strong evidence of this from the booming housing market, banks are still happy to lend people money right now in stark contrast to what we saw in the aftermath of 08.

You are generally right nowever, any risk contraction would be devastating at this point.
So you’d rather get coronavirus which is known to cause those things than take a vaccine which isn’t?

I bought $500 Calls of Adobe and I let them exercise on the 18th. I do not have the money for them. I'm reading online that basically the broker can just force the sale of the stocks on Monday and if its at a loss I owe the difference. Can you guys just give an honest answer

I would only add that in a future year (maybe 2021) when you make $22K ($25K minus $3K used in 2020) or more in profit, you can use the remaining loss credit to reduce tax on those gains.

Am I reading this wrong? This seems to indicate a very strong capital position?  These are measures of capital ratios and the highlighted institution has the highest capital ratios of the group. What am I missing? 

The lowest capital ratios would indicate higher leverage. In other words, the ones with low numbers are lending out more of their balance sheet than those with high ratios. 

What am I missing here?

Don't waste money on tax person. Like previous person said 3k a year is the max u can deduct from w2 wages if your lucky enough to have a job.  How old are you?  If you decide to trade again in the future and have capital gains in the future you can then write the whole gain off against those losses.  So hurry up and buy some FD calls in PLTR or TSLA with your rent money and you will have 50k in profits and be getting hookers and cocaine and paying the IRS.  Worse case scenario it doesn't hit and your homeless with COVID but you have an even bigger tax write off.  YOLO
Was ending the fed lending powers on dec. 31 really priced in all along? Republicans apparently said today that they always intended to let the programs expire at the end of the year

“This agreement rescinds more than $429 billion in unused CARES Act funds; definitively ends the CARES Act lending facilities by December 31, 2020; stops these facilities from being restarted; and forbids them from being duplicated without congressional approval,” said Steve Kelly, Toomey’s communications director.

hello son 🤗 you are right at home here 😂
Unsure if you know what you’re saying. Especially given that banks in 2008 were not under the same regulations as today. As such, calculations for the CET1 was not uniform as RWA was calculated on optimistic judgement opposed to a more non-bias metric. 

A high CET1 is actually very good for the bank. DB beats the minimum Basel III requirements. 

For those who don’t know how to calculate common equity tier 1 (CET1), it’s simply; 

Money / Risk Investment 

The less money you have and the riskier assets, the lower your percent. Banks have a minimum percent of 6% any lower and banks would fail the stress test. DB doesn’t seem to be levered. In fact, they seem to be the best positioned.

Moreover, look at their lever ratio. For all, they are not levered to the tits. Which is why banks soared by an average of 4% AH on Friday given that the Fed allowed banks to do stock buybacks.

Presumably seizing DB America could lead to a diplomatic crisis and panic financial markets. From that angle it makes sense not to seize the bank, but it’s very weird to show such bad marks for DB and still say everything is great.

I’m not a model builder and need more time to see how the scenarios were built, but it also felt like the $92 Billion in CRE loses in the severe scenario are a lowball estimate compared to how badly CRE got messed up by COVID and could snowball into its own crisis. This would hit DB harder since it became the largest US CRE financier after the Corona Crash.

So ready, doubled down on Friday
That source doesn't mean printer is A OK though. A big problem in 08 was that Fed did stimmy to banks, but banks wouldn't lend to small businesses and others, and so those collapsed. And that prolonged the pain. The problem is that the banks are going to be too risk averse in this climate, even with Fed support, and so credit to small business will continue to be very tight without direct support from the Fed.
I have a feeling that TSLA gonna drive SPY up to 386 on Monday. Lets go! 🚀

If you know how to follow precise instructions and don't have a complicated tax situation otherwise, like property purchase/sale, 401k or IRA loans/distributions, business gains/losses, divorce, alimony, foreign accounts and gains, etc., you are probably ok using TurboTax if you can't afford a proper accountant. 

If you use it, FOLLOW the instructions! Gather your 1099 forms from your broker(s) and read the linked documents in the instructions. You need the Premier version or above. Do not buy the wrong version.

Since you have more losses than you can claim credit for, you are likely to be offsetting any gains that you might have for years. This is where the 2021 tax return will be important, you don't want to forget claiming the remainder of the loss in subsequent returns. I've used TurboTax for years even for a more complicated tax situation and I like that it tracks the data you enter over past returns. 

I hope this helps.

State and local governments are the ones that need the loans, not big corporations. That’s why Wall Street didn’t give a shit about Trump’s tax cuts, because if you don’t have a middle class you don’t have a market. States are in turmoil and hospitals are being overrun. State unemployment budgets are strapped and the vaccine is a massive pile of controversy at the moment. Wall Street wanted Biden because he planned to help state and local government

Hello my favourite degenerates... I put this video together using data from Credit Suisse's Global Wealth Report. It's meant as a companion piece to this video here: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkdz4...](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kkdz4scGy04)  

What's interesting is the previous video calculated median, whereas this one does average. The results are similar but far from identical - for example, the USA which is currently ranked 22nd on median wealth is ranked 3rd on average wealth, presumably because the USA has lots of high net wealth individuals that skew the average, and lots of retards on WSB who bring down the median.

How many trades and which platform? Many can autoimport to turbotax and taxact. Robinhood is gay as all fuck and will only export to turbotax. You can enter your losses manually, too, which is some real reality which may be good for ya, if it wasn't thousands of trades.

Best of luck. Sounds like my 2019.

E- It's not at all complicated, tax wise.
 Just a bitch if it's a lot of trades. Standard forms will all tell you the total loss after you have everything entered and the max 3k loss you can take for this year. Enjoy carrying this memory for the next 8 years everytime you get to claim that 3k.

Hey boys it's time to think about copper. One way you can play the entire EV boom without picking individual SPACs. Copper at 7 year high approaching all time high. Me, I'm about a medium high right now.
I have the $1600 so if its just depositing that I'm fine
Who fucking tips for take out
Apparently the printer is not safe
Maybe I’m an autist but how do I sell a put against 100 shares?
> it’s possible you can get 3 or 4 additional shares for every 9 you own  bringing the average price down further. Most likely traders will sell  pre-deal close due to a pop in price so if we assume 3 additional shares  for ever 9 owned you will have an entry price of $24.70 now. 

No. You pretty clearly have no idea what you're hyping.

Those extra warrants are only in play if the shares are redeemed for trust value, which will only happen if PSTH is at or under $20. If you're buying in at $25+, getting more than the 2/9ths ratio would mean something went very very wrong.

I like Ackman, and I really like the structure of his SPAC, but but buying in now is not a deal. It's a real gamble. This isn't some little SPAC buying part of a $1.5b dollar company, it's a massive SPAC buying part of a $20b-$70b dollar company. It's a lot easier for a $1.5b deal to ride the hype and trade at $3b than it is for one at $70b to trade at even $100b. 

Can it happen? Of course, but it's absolutely nowhere near a sure thing.

Not saying you’re wrong, but isn’t price determined more by supply/demand for available shares? Big holders means fewer shares for sale. Retail TSLA stock buyers are still out there. Now Boomer investors, who may have avoided TSLA for years are holding it until death.

It was the debt market propping up that has wallstreet risk-on and 0% interest rates.

The language inserted stops creating/extending programs to help smaller business, state/local gov etc with loans.

Instead they will need to get said loans from the private debt market (which the fed is able to keep healthy by still buying up credit bonds).

AirBNB has the most compelling combination of story plus moat imo. Staying in a house is just so much better than a hotel. Excellent user interface and geographical search functions as well. It is a fun website to peruse, the most enjoyable experience that I''ve had spending $1000 bucks in a while. It makes planning a vacation a much more personal and unique feeling experience.

Their moat is also pretty huge. No uber vs lyft duality going on. It takes a lot of trust and brand capital to get people to rent a house to and from strangers, but they have enough reviews now that it seems pretty safe. I mean almost every place has a review score over a 4.5. Not much regulatory issues that Ive heard of either, though state and local governments have raised/introduced more rental taxes which does make it a bit steep in some areas... But still better all around value than a hotel. 

Sorry for the essay, but I am a believer and I plan on taking a position this week. And I am definitely looking forward to the 5 day mini summer vacation that I booked on Air BNB just this past week.

MOFOS BETTER WITHDRAW THAT 100K NEXT WEEK. 0 % interest loan that you can pay back over 3 years ?? already withdrew mine and put it all in pltr, nio, and unfortunately crm leaps
no wait seriously what happens lol
the market dropped all day Friday on fears that we might not get stimulus. How is it priced in
Yeah that's kinda what I think too.  IMO the spy generally sucks for day trading as it's super choppy and more based on algos jerking you and your order back and forth.   In March the spy was moving the whole market due to the volatility but now the spy is just a big spinning dick 75% of days for day traders.  I guess Tsla will be good for trading it on days when it has some sort of news that is moving it.  Other than that I think it will just follow the SPY in 2021.
You’ll outperform the market

This. Not joking, the scary next mental step is that with some of the folks on here with the 6figure+ gains on 3-4 figure initial investments, can they justify the time spent at their 9-5?  
  
If 40 hours of focus would yield even a 50% improvement in investment, It’d make an interesting case.

AMA: I have an average office job with great flexibility and I make $100k even. I started saving 6k each year for 5 years and then that ballooned from 50k in February 2020 to 400k. In September I went up 160k and December I'm down 100k so the volatility is pretty big. No margins, no selling options (only buying), no weeklies.

I didn’t expect the Fed and FDIC be so patient with a bank this leveraged. By most measurements they fail to meet Basel III or fed capital requirements, but FDIC hasn’t kicked down the doors. Wamu went down on less precarious financial footing than DB.
Biden couldn't be President of a dog's asshole forget about bieng President of United States
So there is pullback on the language but I also read on twitter that even the language they wanted to introduce didn't actually touch the feds ability to prop up the credit markets, only it's ability to continue to extend it's corporate credit facility or create similar programs.

The GOP are bitching because under the current rules the Fed could lend that money to state or local governments without congress sign off and they see this as a loophole for Democrats to help struggling states.

So long story short the printers were never truly at risk (which makes sense GOP would get crucified by their donors for doing that) it's just about trying to stop Democrats from helping poor people.

I shared the google sheets, already accounted for the 21 days.  Actually covid only counts 7 days after the second innoculation.  All part of the calc in the sheets.

Again only part I am uncertain of is how long they are going to hold on to the news after unblinding. Any insights?
Looking pretty good for my 377 calls and upro shares I bought Friday
Are they worth 0.5T based purely on current metrics? : hell no.  
Do I expect them to fill that gap in the next 4-5 years, absolutely.
  
In the same breath; me personally having driven competing EVs, the bolt in particular for distance and service/maintenance, the Tesla experience is as different as a Galaxy/Note/iPhone is from a blackberry.  IMHO it’s not hyperbole. Based on every aspect of my experience with Tesla the last ~2.5 years, including service, it exceeds that of dealing with a traditional car manufacturer.

Is it really stimmy if the Fed can’t go brrrr? 🤔eh who the fuck cares, we mooning on Monday!🤡💰🤡💰🤡💰
If it’s a ~2% day Monday, that’s 377-378. You’d be hard pressed not to sell then and take profits. For mine, I’ll probably hold till Wednesday and reevaluate.
This just seems like common sense. I was an auditor for 5 years and wasn’t allowed to trade stocks in that time, due to sensitive information me and my colleagues had access to. Same logic applies here
Doesn’t matter as long as it keeps pumping the market. We aren’t going to see 360 again for a while.

That's why I think it's a delayed problem. I would imagine consumer demand remains weak next year and beyond which will lead to high paid job cuts. Companies have already cut the low level workers but eventually office staff have to go if they want to remain solvent. Then with those losses you could see another housing mess as mortgages go unpaid
[deleted]
How does it feel being right?
Moreover. More unemployment = increases in government spending, increased marginal propensity to invest (huhu im actually poor need to buy more stonk for future), increased marginal propensity to gamble (buy options ftw), increased money supply (jpow print print), low interest rates (why the fuck do I buy bonds when I can buy TSLA and make 700%?). All positive macros folks.

Lmao fantastic DD
Imma sound a little mean here but....the jobs lost don't really matter when it comes to the market. Service industry and people making less than 6 figures don't have a big effect on market. The job loss is overblown for markets sake. 2009 had people making a lot of money lose jobs, not this time.
How come all these small cap stocks all have an absolute massive fucking dildo rally past month. There’s gotta be a decent correction around the corner
I’m going with the long range model 3 w/ upgraded rims
I said something similar in another comment but the problem with this is that wealthy  congress-people could "hold out" as a negotiating tactic against less wealthy congress-people. Since the wealthy person doesn't need the salary they could intending keep things shut down until the poor congress-person has no choice but to compromise. 

So doing something like this gives even more power to the wealthier congress- people.  The results would be the opposite of the intended effect. 

At the end of the day the congressional salary is basically nothing to the wealthy congress- people. Lowering it or taking it away isn't going to have much impact on how they act.

Lol a blank quote. Classic 2020
I um don’t believe in Human Nature... I think it changes over time and location and position.

See:  Hannah Arendt “Human Condition”


Basically, I can’t disprove anything because I don’t have any examples to pull from.  There has never been an actual Communist country.  Communist parties running State Capitalism aren’t Communism.  Socialist-esque countries aren’t Communism.

But as you yourself said.. we live in a mixed market.  This is because capitalism is failing.  I’m not saying it didn’t work or that it wasn’t needed. Just that it’s time is almost over.

You don’t think it’s possible, but I’ve given you people and links to look into to show you that it is.  And when it gets going, people are assassinated.   

I can only show you that the idea is plausible and that the ideas of “this won’t work because” have already been refuted if they aren’t based on false assumptions.

With that said spy bears are still retarded
There is one more biggie that makes $ORCL interesting: the SCOTUS is due to close on the Google vs. Oracle case. If Oracle prevails, the royalties for Android and the damages from Google are going to be in the billions. The market has priced in Google prevailing, but the recent uptick in ORCL is definitely preluding to something. For now, spreads on ORCL netted me 30K this Friday. I like your position, even though 70 seems a little too much OTM to get anywhere.

OP is a moron who thought vaccine roll out into v shaped recovery combined with Fed reaffirming 0% rates combined with a stimulus being signed this weekend would be a recipe for a down market and now he’s going to lose everything. 

That’s what happened in a nutshell.
whats coming?
I don't have any puts but if I did I would be shitting my pants

Some of you are dumb and still buying puts bc you don't understand that 0% interest rates mean free money for the next 3 years. Miss me with any historical comparisons bc this is the best its ever been. P/e and all that don't mean anything with 0% rates
I get what you're saying,  but I think this is the type of law that would have the opposite of its intended effect. 

If you paid congress-people less, it wouldn't really impact the rich ones.  For anyone who you think of as unreasonably rich,  their congressional salary is going to be a very small portion of their income. So taking it away or reducing it really won't effect them. 

On the other hand,  that salary basically guarantees that any poor or middle class person who makes it into congress can live comfortably (frankly i might even include people who are just slightly into upper class territory too).  So they can take the congressional job without worrying about their finances, or feeling like they could be making more elsewhere. 

Guaranteeing a good congressional salary protects the few poor and middle class people who get it congress.

Maybe a better idea would be that the congressional salary phases out if you make too much money.  So if someone is already making $5m a year they just don't get a salary in congress (I'm sure the cutoff should be lower than that but I didn't really want to get into a debate over that detail so I went with a very high number where anyone would agree they don't need the salary.)

i'd do short term (weeklies) and dont do next week because its going to moon. if it gets to $33.50ish and looks like it wont go beyond, then think about selling covered calls there. otherwise you will want to hold until $40ish and then think about selling covered calls there

“It was definitely not obvious” this thread is filled with people telling you that you’re wrong dumb fuck.
They're required to disclose trades within 30 days. Rarely are those blatantly timed before news releases that occur prior to disclosure, because they're not stupid.
It boggles my mind how they can look at all the overwhelmingly positive news on the horizon paired with the lowest interest rates in history and conclude that stocks will go down. It’s truly stunning.

You forgot to factor in the fact that people have to get 2 shots 21 days apart. You gotta shift everything by 21 days.

That's old news dude. Move on!
This is quite different.  The moderna/pfizer approval meeting are news that are known in advance...meaning everyone knew the P3 published numbers already so meeting was more or less just a formality for approval...so the stock had a chance to advance in advance of the news.  This p3 news is still unknown both in the results and date of release....so no fucking way the market can rise in anticipation of it.  So once this p3 news comes out, the market has to digest this new information and price the stock accordingly.

Novavas has two great advantages on Pfizer and Moderna...one this type of vaccine has less of an adverse reaction as compared with mRNA vaccines, also this Novavax vaccine does not require refrigeration...it works in between 2C to 8C....So if it works comparably to those two, it would have a significant market advantage.

The biggest news in the stimulus breakthrough is about the Fed. In it, the govt is not curtailing or hindering the Fed's ability to "act." This was becoming a little scary with a stupid last minute curve ball by a senator who tried to restrict the Fed. 

Basically the Fed's printer remains on brrrrrrrrrrrrr mode with this bill. This is HUGE and good for awhile (2-3 yrs, minimum)

Same thing.  Then 8 minutes, then 10 minutes, and well, now it’s been 12 minutes since and I’ve been pooping for over 30 minutes, so fuck it.  Anyone else have this annoying problem?

First of all you have really have a basic understanding how P3 trials work to even understand what I wrote there.  An executive essentially said that for their P3, they are going to unblind (meaning that do an analysis between there are 50 Covid cases in their testing population).  So based on their enrollment numbers(dates), guessing on efficacy of their vaccine UK covid infection rates, you can make a guess on when out of the 15K population you are going to hit 50 Covid cases.  In other words, if their vaccine is shit, they are going to hit 50 much sooner (meaning that you are going to get positive Covid cases in the vaccine group in addition to the placebo group).  This is actually pretty simple math.

Only thing that may throw this off is how long before they publish public news once they unblind.  I am thinking it is around 3 days but not 100% sure on that.

Dude. You literally didn’t play it. Nobody knew it was going to do that for sure because you didn’t see anyone play it like that.

How are you still on this subreddit when you are so dumb and poor 🤡
If you want my advice, I own leaps and short term calls...Don’t buy leaps yet. Load up on calls that expire after the late Jan ER. It’s going to be epic. The gains will be much higher on the shorter ones, then you’ll have more money to put into leaps. This is the way.

The fuck are you talking about? Because an agreement finally got signed too little too late? If it weren’t a divided government the stimulus would have pass long ago, helping the economy, helping the people, and helping stocks. How the hell can you possibly think a $600 check months too late because of a hopelessly divided government is a good think.
Look at their valuation between Novax and Moderna...also it is known that mRNA has a much bigger reaction initially than this type of vaccine...Novavax at 8B while Moderna is already pass 50B.  Additionally, Novavax has already passed P3 for their Nanoflu vaccine...which can potentially be combined with this covid vaccine.

Also u like to type things out a certain way to make yourself sound smarter, I just simply don’t care if u think I’m smart or not ur just a random asshole
Yeah you're probably right. I'm talking to a potato head.
Imagine thinking its a sell the news
thanks brother good point
Yeah like everyone has adhd now just because it's hard to focus on shit that's not interesting to them. I just think it's weird how the stats keep increasing in modern times when before if you just treated a kid like they were normal they grew out of the behavior. I know it's deeper than this in some cases but if you tell someone they lack fundamental social skills and are incapable of changing and it's okay , they probably won't end up picking up on them even though possible
Breaking news, congress annouces to everyone to get ready to be stimulated.
You laugh but if back in March someone had said that TSLA will be $3k by end of year in a pandemic, they’d be called crazy. OP is on to something.

Ok. You need an intervention. Never Ever think of a high PE ratio as a reason to sell or a low PE as a reason to buy. It’s actually the opposite. Believe me. I know it’s counter intuitive but it shows the market perception of a company.

Do you have a crystalball to know which company will go up or which will go down ? By your logic INTL should had been 1 Trillion $ company.
Glad they reached agreement on stimulus.  That should counteract the UK virus news.  Stonks go up.

mcac merging with playboy.  sounds hilarious.  don't think i've heard much of it here, thoughts?
I think it might ride the stimulus wave a bit higher on Monday, but yeah there is truly nothing to justify the share price. This isn't a Tesla situation, they're one of several smaller players in the space, and their share price is out of sync with the rest of the industry. They're hanging out at $13b right now, in comparison to Velodyne at $3.4b. That's more than 3x a company doing 10x their revenue.
same. waiting 4 more info. but it sounds like things got smoothed out and either the printer is safe or the central bank will take the role of the printer when necessary..?
the stimulus is priced in

Here some more basic math for you:

QQQ to $400 = $44.27 profit/share = $4427/573 = 772% RoI

I don't know senator salary historically, but the current 400k for president is basically the lowest it's ever been adjusted for inflation.

Yeah I can never tell if I have adult ADHD or a little bit of autism or perhaps a bit of both.  Like you said, I’m also very literal and have frequent issues with hyper-focus, but unlike you I’m good at parsing sly remarks and no real issues with textures, etc.  That being said, I’m also just a bit over-sensitive in general, have somewhat poor impulse control and VERY low anxiety compared to other people.  So, weird mix.  I’m diagnosed with adult ADHD but I wonder what the real brain chemistry is behind that (and mild autism for that matter)

Truth be told, if I was working a more 'professional' job, I'd have less time to trade. I work basically all day on weekends which is cool because obviously there's no market, and on weekdays I don't clock in till 4pm. Plus I'm my own boss, and make decent money for my age all things considered. Unfortunately the cost is having to be here and having almost no life outside of making money (work + trading).
